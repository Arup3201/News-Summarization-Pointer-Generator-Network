Information about an undercover operation to get information from a suspect in the murder of Stephen Lawrence, pictured, was leaked by one of the handlers, it emerged today

An undercover police operation to target a suspect in the Stephen Lawrence murder inquiry was thrown into turmoil after a leak by their handler, it emerged today.

Two police officers, a man and a woman, moved into a house next door to one of the prime suspects, posing as a couple, and set out to befriend the suspect, who was seen as a potential weak link, in a top-secret sting.

But the safety of the officers, who lived in the property for several years, passing on useful intelligence to detectives, was compromised when one of their welfare officers told a friend about the covert operation.

The leak only came to light when the friend, who had no connection to Greater Manchester Police (GMP) force, which supplied the covert officers, was spoken to by police about an affair she had with a GMP officer not linked to the Lawrence sting.

The handler was removed from the unit for leaking confidential information, but police bosses decided not to stop the operation, according to a tip passed on to the Manchester Evening News.

The undercover operation, which is thought to have begun in 2002, nearly a decade after the black teenager was killed, continued, with the couple often wired up to relay live conversations with the suspect.

It involved two officers from Manchester posing as a couple who had just moved down to London from the north, as police believed using officers from London would be too obvious.

Only a handful of the top officers at GMP knew about the sting, and a back-up team of 20 officers was on standby in case the couple's cover was blown, placing their lives in danger.

The suspect targeted by the sting - one of five men suspected of murdering the 18-year-old - has not been named.Â  GMP had been asked to provide officers to go undercover as it was thought too obvious to use London officers.

But the officers were not involved in the operation by Scotland Yard's disgraced Special Demonstration Squad, an ultra-secret wing of Special Branch which is now the subject of a public inquiry.

Earlier this month, a report into the
 SDS unit revealed that it had placed a spy in the camp of the family of
 the teenager, who was stabbed to death in south-east London in April 
1993.

One senior source with surveillance expertise, said: 'I would be surprised if my officers were left undercover if their safety had been compromised by such a monumental leak of information.

'The Met and GMP would have no guarantee of knowing who else the woman had gossiped to about the operation.'

Assistant Chief Constable Steve Heywood, of GMP, said: 'Greater Manchester Police does not normally confirm or deny information about undercover police deployments unless it has become public knowledge as part of criminal proceedings.

'The position is necessary to protect the identity of those officers who carry out, or have carried out, undercover work.'
