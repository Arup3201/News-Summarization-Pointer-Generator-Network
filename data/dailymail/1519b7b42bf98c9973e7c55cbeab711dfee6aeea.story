The hook, a spring clasp, is estimated to have been stuck in the dog's leg for about five to seven days and the dog also had large, deep gashes on its two front legs. 

The clasp is similar to those used on dog chains and leashes, according to Bakersfield Police Sgt. Joseph Grubbs.

The dog was sedated and underwent surgery to remove the hook and clean the wounds. 

It has been placed on antibiotic drugs to stop infection. 

Marley's Mutts Dog Rescue, a nonprofit group has offered a $1,000 reward to anyone who can help police with the arrest and prosecution of the animal's abuser.

They have taken over looking after the dog who they have named 'Boy.'

Jeremy Cable, who is looking after him for the family said: 'Yesterday he was pretty scared, he didn't want to walk around too much but within an hour or so he was used to everyone in our house. 

'I can tell he is going to be a really good dog for someone.'

'It is reward to see how much he has changed in 25 hours.'

The group is now appealing for someone to foster the dog.
