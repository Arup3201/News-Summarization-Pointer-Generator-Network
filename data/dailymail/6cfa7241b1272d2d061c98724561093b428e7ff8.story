Meet Nigella Lawson's Team Cupcake - the PR, lawyer and family member helping the TV chef win the public sympathy battle against her ex-husband Charles Saatchi.

She may have admitted snorting cocaine and smoking cannabis as she gave evidence in court this week, but it seems she hasn't lost many fans over the revelation.

According to a survey, 'Domestic Goddess' Nigella has actually gained public sympathy since dramatically giving evidence at the trial of her two former assistants accused of fraud.

The YouGov poll found that 39 per cent of people have more sympathy for Miss Lawson than they did before she gave evidence - compared with just two per cent who have taken her ex-husband's side.

Team Cupcake: Nigella Lawson's team of lawyers, PRs and family who supported her as she gave evidence at Isleworth Crown Court

Nigella Lawson, pictured arriving at court this week (left), seems to have won more public sympathy with her admission of taking drugs while ex-husband Charles Saatchi, right, has seen his reputation apparently tarnished

As she went through the ordeal of giving 
evidence at Isleworth Crown Court, she has been supported by a whole team of advisers.

Her team at her side included two leading lawyers at Schillings - Chris Scott, a partner, and associate Joelle Rich.

She was also supported by her brother Dominic Lawson, a newspaper columnist, and her PR adviser Mark Hutchinson who has worked with her since she published her first book in 1998. He also works with JK Rowling.

Around two thirds of people surveyed by YouGov said her drug confession made no difference to their opinion of her with and only 20 per cent thought less of the 53-year-old because of it.

Ten per cent said that their perception of Miss Lawson has now improved, according to the Sunday Times.

During the fraud trial at Isleworth Crown Court, a scathing email from ex-husband Charles Saatchi accused her of being 'so off your head on drugs' that she had allowed the PAs to spend 'whatever they liked'.

In a dramatic courtroom confession during two days on the witness stand, Miss Lawson admitted to having snorted cocaine and having smoked cannabis in front of her children.

But she denied being an addict claiming said she needed the drugs to cope with the death of her first husband, John Diamond, and the ‘intimate terrorism’ of her second, Charles Saatchi.

Miss Lawson protested 'I am being put on trial here' as she was repeatedly questioned about drug-taking and the collapse of her marriage.

While her drug-taking admission grabbed the headlines, she also told of Mr Saatchi's temper and his keen interest in domestic life. She also accused him of subjecting her to 'intimate terrorism'.

The mother-of-two was actually giving evidence against her two former public assistants Elisabetta and Francesca Grillo at Isleworth Crown Court.

The Italian sisters are accused of going on lavish shopping sprees and spending £685,000 on Charles Saatchi's company credit cards over a four-year period. They deny any wrongdoing.

While critics have said Miss Lawson's reputation has been on trial, she appears to have garnered a great deal of public sympathy.

Not damaged: PR experts have claimed that revelations that she took drugs in the past might even boost her career in the US

Mr Saatchi told the jury that he still 'adores' Nigella and is 'heartbroken' that they divorced after a 10-year marriage.

The couple's marriage collapsed after he accepted a police caution for grabbing Nigella by the throat outside Scott's restaurant in Mayfair, central London, earlier this year.

James Herring of public relations firm Taylor Herring, told the Sunday Times: 'Whoever was behind the allegations of Nigella Lawson's drug taking seems to have overestimated the damage it would do.

'Nigella is very much her own brand and that brand is about foodie indulgence and authenticity.

'People like their celebrities to be fallible and human.'

The TV chef is currently trying to crack the lucrative American market with a second series of her show The Taste due to start airing next month.

The show is being brought to Britain by Channel 4 in the new year.

And some PR experts have claimed that rather than ending her Stateside career, her drug revelations might even give it a boost.

PR guru Mark Borkowski, compared Nigella to the likes of Kate Moss, BP, Ryan Air and Elton John,  'brands', which have successfully bounced back from adverse publicity.

Writing in his personal blog he said: 'Post crisis the beleaguered brand with the best story will recover more quickly.

'Brands and individuals may well suffer slights and injuries, but with a brilliant team, smarter thinking, resilient strategy, perspective and intuitive creativity they can rise from yesterday’s newspaper with a stronger narrative and a much brighter, sounder future.'
