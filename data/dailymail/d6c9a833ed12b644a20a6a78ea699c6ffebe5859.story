CSKA Moscow have opened talks over a new contract for striker Seydou Doumbia amid interest from several Premier League clubs.

Doumbia, 26, scored the goals that have put Manchester City's Champions League campaign in jeopardy and is keen to test himself in the Premier League.

Chelsea, Arsenal, Liverpool and Tottenham Hotspur have all been sounded out to see if they wish to buy the Ivory Coast international with CSKA keen to get the most for their asset.

They were willing to listen to offers of around £15million but may now look for his buy-out clause of £25m.

Doumbia's current deal runs until 2016 but he is interested to see what offers come in prior to committing himself further.

His representative Jean Bernard Beytrison said: 'We are currently in negotiations over a new contract. There is plenty of interest in Seydou from England plus clubs in Spain, Germany and Italy.

'He is a goalscorer and there aren't many of them around. However, he is contracted to CSKA and clubs will have to pay their fee.'
