Delighted: Kate Silverton, 43, has spoken of her shock at conceiving naturally twice despite setbacks

TV newsreader Kate Silverton has told how becoming pregnant for a second time against all expectations is 'beyond a miracle'.

The BBC presenter has struggled for years with fertility problems, undergoing IVF a number of times.

Now, having conceived naturally for a second time, she has urged women to keep trying through the 'tough times'.

'To be blessed with baby number two seems beyond a miracle,' the 43-year-old told Hello! magazine.

'It seems it's also beyond the doctors' understanding, too. It's simply amazing and we are so excited.'

She and her husband Mike Heron have had years of setbacks in their efforts to have children.

Miss Silverton had lost an ovary during an operation to remove a cyst when she was 29, and resigned herself to life without children after four rounds of IVF treatment.

Finally, in November 2011, the couple were delighted to welcome their daughter Clemency, conceived naturally.

It gave Miss Silverton the hope to try again, she explains - two months ahead of the birth of her second child.

'I have felt such utter joy in motherhood that I just wanted the chance to do it all over again.

'Despite my limited chances, I thought it was worth trying again. I just wanted to have one more try naturally and see what happened.'

It has not been straightforward and she has had two miscarriages after Clemency's birth which led to her waiting in this pregnancy before going public.

She went through four rounds of IVF with partner Mike Heron before Clemency was born in November 2011

Miss Silverton hopes she will be able to provide support for others who have difficulty conceiving in the future.

'I think it helps for women and their partners to be able to talk openly about what they are going through and to know they're not alone, and that even with the tough times there can always be hope,' she said.

'Mike and I struggled to have children for the last seven years. Now it feels as if we're coming to the fruition of a long but lovely journey. I would love to know that there are others out there who are able to do the same.'
