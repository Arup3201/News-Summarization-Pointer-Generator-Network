The Swedish royal family added a touch of glamour to an eco-conscious party in New York City.

Queen Silvia, King Carl XVI Gustaf and Princess Madeleine of Sweden attended the 5th Annual Green Summit and Gala Dinner - which took place in Goldman Sachs and the Mandarin Oriental, respectively -  held to discuss sustainability within the food chain.

And following a number of speakers, the evening ended with a performance from the cast of Wicked the musical.

The King - who wore a black tuxedo - and Queen - dressed in a lilac floor-length evening dress and short cream fur coat - attended the event with their youngest child, 30-year-old Princess Madeleine.

Princess Madeleine opted for a black, floor-length, off-the-shoulder gown featuring balloon-sleeves and jewel detailing.

The princess is third in line to the Swedish throne after her sister Crown Princess Victoria, 35, who married Daniel Westling, a personal trainer and gym owner, in the summer of 2010.

The Crown Princess and Prince Daniel have a seven-month-old daughter, Princess Estelle, who is second-in-line to the throne before Victoria and Madeleine's brother, Prince Carl-Philip, 33.

Neither of Princess Madeleine's elder siblings were present at the New York event last night.

Accompanied by her dapper, tuxedo-wearing husband King Carl XVI Gustaf, Queen Silvia wore a floor-length lilac evening gown with a two-strand pearl necklace and a short cream fur coat.

The Swedish-American Chamber of 
Commerce in New York (SACC) held the event - which was sponsored by 
brands including Swedish furniture company IKEA, Purity Vodka, Elsa 
& Me, Deloitte, Unilever, Accenture and Aquavit - to 'create an 
electric dialogue on sustainability'.

Following
on last year's success, the focus of the yesterday's summit - entitled 
'From Farm To Fork' - was on sustainability in the food chain, and 
explored how to feed a city and fuel the food chain.

The aim of the day-long summit - to which tickets cost $295 (£183) - was 'to learn how the brightest minds in business, 
academics and culture are realising the opportunities present in 
today's food chain while keeping sustainability at the top of the 
agenda'.

Princess Madeleine wore a black, floor-length, off-the-shoulder evening gown with jewel embellishment and balloon sleeves.

Speakers included H.E. Mr Jan Eliasson, 
Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations; Mr Michael Treschow, 
Chairman of Unilever; Professor Jeffrey D. Sachs, Director of the Earth 
Institute at Columbia University; and Mr. Marcus Samuelsson, food 
activist and chef.

Tickets 
to the gala dinner at the Mandarin Oriental cost $495 (£307), or $695 
(£431) when purchased in combination with a ticket to the summit.

The dinner 
featured a presentation of the SACC New York-Deloitte Green Award and
musical entertainment by the cast of Wicked, in collaboration with the Broadway Green Alliance.
