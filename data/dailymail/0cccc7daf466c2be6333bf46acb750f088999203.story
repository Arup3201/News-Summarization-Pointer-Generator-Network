A High Court judge has ordered the name of a woman sent to prison to be kept from the public – despite rules saying no one should be jailed in secret.

Mrs Justice Roberts defied instructions from Britain’s most senior judges by banning her from being identified.

The single mother, who was jailed for seven days for contempt of court, was suspected of planning to flee the UK to stop social workers taking her daughter into care.

She was found guilty after failing to surrender her passport and the girl’s on a court’s orders.

The High Court judge ruled that European human rights law overrides the British ban on secret imprisonment. She said the mother’s name must be suppressed to protect the privacy of her daughter, who is in the care of social workers in London.

Her decision to order reporting restrictions was made despite guidance laid down in the Appeal Court less than two years ago on the authority of the most senior judge, the Lord Chief Justice.

Mrs Justice Roberts made her ruling after being reminded by lawyers about the Appeal Court directions.

It means the courts have returned to the practice of secret imprisonment that is thought to have ended in 2013 after the Mail revealed the case of Wanda Maddocks. Miss Maddocks was jailed for trying to remove her father from a care home where she thought his life was in danger, against a judge’s orders. The public were forbidden to know her name or any details of her case.

Lib Dem MP John Hemming said of the single mother ruling: ‘This is a coup against justice. Civilised countries do not bang people up in secret.’ As the row over her imprisonment grew, High Court officials announced that a new hearing in the case will be held today ‘where the judge will bring the attention of counsel to the mandatory aspect of the 2013 guidance’.

The mother was sentenced by Mrs Justice Roberts in London on Tuesday. It took place in open court and those present were able to learn her name. But the judge set down sweeping reporting restrictions meaning no one else is allowed to know.

Social workers from Richmond, south-west London, had said they feared the mother might try to take her daughter to Jamaica. The borough’s children’s services staff, who want to take the girl from her mother permanently, said questions had been raised about the woman’s mental health. They called for her name not to be published, to protect the girl.

Mrs Justice Roberts said: ‘There is no doubt in my mind these restrictions are appropriate.’

In May 2013, then Lord Chief Justice Lord Judge and President of the Family Division Sir James Munby declared whenever someone is jailed for contempt they should be publicly named, saying: ‘There are no exceptions.’
