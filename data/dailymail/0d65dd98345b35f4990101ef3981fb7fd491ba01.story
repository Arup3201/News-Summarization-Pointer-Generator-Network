Referring to the 10-year-old, great-aunt Solanlly Garcia told the newspaper 'We had hope they were going to pull him out the fire with his brother. He was always happy, full of life. He was always smiling.'

The ten-year-old's aunt Jokarina Medina told the newspaper '[His mother] was in shock.'

The four-alarm blaze was reported at about 3am Tuesday.

The Lawrence Police Department tweeted photos of the early morning fire, which it said took place on Kingston Street.

'Upon arrival there was heavy fire, especially in the rear of the home,' Coan said, according to WCVB. 'After a preliminary view of the building, is seems there were smoke alarms. We will do more of a forensic review of the entire fire alarm system.'

Three other residents and one firefighter were hurt.

The extent of the injuries wasn't immediately released.

'At this point it's just an extremely tragic morning here in Lawrence,' Coan said, according to WHDH. 'Fire continues to take such an awful toll in our state. 

'It pains me as state fire marshal to have to be here this morning, but we will do everything we can to come to a successful conclusion of this investigation to bring some closure to the parent of these young boys.'
