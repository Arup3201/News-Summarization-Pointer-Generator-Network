Ancient Earth may have had an extra-terrestrial supply of vitamin B3 delivered by carbon-rich meteorites. 

This is according to Nasa-funded scientists who have been exploring the potential mix of ingredients brought to the planet from space.  

The study supports the theory that life on Earth may have been kick-started by a supply of molecules created in space which hitched a ride to the planet on meteorites.

While scientists aren't yet sure exactly how these ingredients were cooked up, they predict radiation-blasted ice powered the chemical reactions that produced vitamin B3.

‘Vitamin B3, also called nicotinic acid or niacin, is a precursor to Nad (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide), which is essential to metabolism and likely very ancient in origin,’ said Karen Smith of Pennsylvania State University. 

This isn’t the first time vitamin B3 has been found in meteorites. In 2001 a team led by Sandra Pizzarello of Arizona State University discovered it in the Tagish Lake meteorite.

A similar study last year found that the building blocks of life can spring into existence spontaneously when icy comets smash into planets.

Scientists believe that about the time life first emerged, between 4.5 and 3.8 billion years ago, Earth was being bombarded by comets and meteorites.

Writing in the journal Nature Geoscience, Imperial College London scientists show how when a comet impacts it creates a shock wave that generates the molecules needed for amino acids.

Heat from the impact then transforms these molecules into the protein building blocks.

The scientists point out that abundant ice on the surfaces of Enceladus and Europa, two moons orbiting Saturn and Jupiter, could provide the perfect conditions for producing amino acids from meteor impacts.

In the new work at Goddard's Astrobiology Analytical Laboratory, Dr Smith and her team analysed samples from eight different carbon-rich meteorites and found vitamin B3 at levels ranging from about 30 to 600 parts-per-billion.  

‘We discovered a pattern – less vitamin B3 (and other pyridine carboxylic acids) was found in meteorites that came from asteroids that were more altered by liquid water,’ she said. 

‘One possibility may be that these molecules were destroyed during the prolonged contact with liquid water. 

Asteroids and comets are considered more or less pristine remnants from our solar system's formation, and many meteorites are prized samples from asteroids that happen to be conveniently delivered to Earth.  

When asteroids collide with meteoroids or other asteroids, pieces break off and some of them eventually make their way to Earth as meteorites 

Although meteorites are valued samples from asteroids, they are rarely recovered immediately after they fall to Earth. This leaves them vulnerable to contamination from terrestrial chemistry and life. 

But the team doubts the vitamin B3 and other molecules found in their meteorites came from terrestrial life.

This is because the vitamin B3 was found along with its structural isomers – related molecules that have the same chemical formula but whose atoms are attached in a different order. These other molecules aren't used by life. 

If contamination from terrestrial life was the source of the vitamin B3 in the meteorites, then only the vitamin should have been found, not the other, related molecules. 

The amount of vitamin B3 found was also related to how much the parent asteroids had been altered by water.  

Scientists claim this correlation with conditions on the asteroids would be unlikely if the vitamin came from contamination on Earth. 

The team plans to conduct more interstellar chemistry experiments under more realistic conditions to better understand how vitamin B3 can form on ice grains in space. 

‘We want to add water ice (the dominant component of interstellar ices) and start from simpler organic precursors (building-block molecules) of vitamin B3 to help verify our result,’ said Dr Smith.
