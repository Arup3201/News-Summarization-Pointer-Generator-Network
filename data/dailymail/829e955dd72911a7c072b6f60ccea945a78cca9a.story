No sooner had Twitter co-founder Biz Stone launched his latest app on Tuesday than some smart alec had used it to capture a cheeky photo of Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerman texting and driving at the same time.

Jelly allows users to take a photo and then ask their network of friends on Facebook and Twitter about it in much the same way as you would use a search engine.

Some critics are less than impressed, calling it a ‘vanity project’, but one user Ben Schaechter was quick to put it to good use and posted his photo of the Facebook founder along with the words 'Mark Zuckerberg texting and driving. How do you respond?'

Despite a net worth of around $20 billion, Zuckerberg reportedly drives to work every day in a $40,000 black Volkswagen GTI.

Jelly's free app for iPhones and Android phones allows people to tap into the collective knowledge within their Twitter and Facebook networks to find answers about things that puzzle them.

The questions are accompanied with a photo taken of an object that triggered the curiosity of the app's user.

Twitter and Facebook friends must also have the Jelly app to see the questions. But those friends can then forward the questions to others who might know the answer, even if they don't have the app.

Although Stone believes Jelly can grow into an ‘awesome business,’ Stone doubts he would have tackled the challenges of building another start-up unless he believed it could help teach people that computer-driven algorithms don't necessarily have all the answers in life.

‘If we are successful, then we will be introducing into the daily muscle memory of a whole lot of people this idea of, “How can I help someone today?”’ said Stone. ‘Maybe we can sort of nudge up the global empathy quotient so people start thinking about other people a little more.’

But some critics aren’t so sure, Valleywag has described it as ‘an app for the sake of apps’, a ‘software Fabergé egg’ and a ‘vanity project.’

‘Have you ever posted on Facebook, asking if anyone knows a good barber? Or tweeted to your followers asking if "House of Cards" is any good? That's Jelly - a search engine that uses your friends - only more convoluted than ever before,’ wrote Valleywag’s Sam Biddle.

Ben Schaechter was quick to put the Jelly app to good use and posted his photo of the Facebook founder along with the words 'Mark Zuckerberg texting and driving. How do you respond?'

Stone, 39, can afford to gamble on a company with an altruistic bent after Twitter's successful public stock offering two months ago.

Twitter's stock has more than doubled from its initial public offering price of $26. Just how many millions Stone has made from Twitter remains a mystery because he didn't own enough stock for his stake to be disclosed in regulatory filings.

He has also persuaded former Vice President Al Gore and U2 lead singer Bono to invest, as well as Reid Hoffman, who became a billionaire as co-founder and chairman of professional networking service LinkedIn Corp.

The venture capital firm Spark Capital also has invested an undisclosed amount.

Eventually, Jelly's app will extend its reach into other online networks besides Twitter and Facebook, Stone said.
