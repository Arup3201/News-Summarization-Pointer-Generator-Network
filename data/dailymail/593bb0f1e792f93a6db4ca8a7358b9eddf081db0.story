David Cameron today insisted he and other democratically-elected leaders should pick who gets the top EU jobs - as he went boating with German leader Angela Merkel and other EU leaders at a lakeside summit in Sweden.

The Prime Minister was pictured at the back of a rowing boat at the Swedish PM Fredrik Reinfeldt's summer home in Harpsund 120km west of Stockholm.

The summit came after London Mayor Boris Johnson mocked Mr Cameron's bid to block former Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean-Claude Junker getting the EU's top job. He said it was the ‘quintessence of turd-polishing pointlessness’.

The four leaders are holding talks  on the EU following the rise of the eurosceptic far right in the European Parliament. Mrs Merkel and Mr Cameron are at odds over the appointment of the next European Commission President

In an extraordinary tirade against the Prime Minister’s European strategy, Mr Johnson insisted it made no difference who held key European jobs because it will still wield excessive power over Britain.

The London Mayor claimed vetoing Luxembourger Jean-Claude Juncker is like ‘trying to swat a fly on the leg of the rhino that is standing on your chest’.

Mr Junker had been the favourite to succeed José Manuel Barroso as President of the Commission, with the backing of German Chancellor Angela Merkel.

But Mr Cameron fears the pro-European would scupper his attempts to renegotiate Britain’s membership of the EU. The Prime Minister wants to see more women in senior roles in Brussels and more political balance.

He held talks with Mrs Merkel, Holland's Mark Rutte and the Mr Reinfeldt today, where tradition dictates they all take a trip together in the host’s rowing boat.

Number 10 stressed that the talks will focus on wider economic reforms, but divisions remain over who should have the Commission presidency.

But as he arrived at the summit, Mr Cameron said: 'As the democratically-elected leaders of Europe, we should be the ones to choose who should run these institutions rather than accept some new process which was never agreed. I think that is important.'

However, Mr Johnson today mocked the idea of Mr Cameron vetoing Mr Juncker, adding: ‘Here it comes! With a nape-tingling drumroll the national Excalibur is being loosened from the scabbard.

‘The almighty British veto is about to be unleashed after years of cobwebbed desuetude.’

London Mayor Boris Johnson said David Cameron's attempt to block the new head of the European Commission was like 'trying to swat a fly on the leg of the rhino that is standing on your chest'

Writing in the Telegraph, Mr Johnson said wielding the veto is ‘a pleasurable and no doubt justifiable but basically futile thing to do’.

He argued that the Brussels machine is too big and powerful for the change of personnel at the top to make any meaningful difference.

In addition to Mr Juncker, others in the running include Frenchman Pascal Lamy, who used to run the World Trade Organisation and Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt.

But Mr Johnson said: ‘It doesn’t matter whether you have a Bofferding-quaffing Luxembourger or a dynamic French énarque or a Borgen-esque Scandiwegian or a statue of the Mannekin Pis as president of the EU commission.’

Instead, the EU must be ‘boiled down’ to the single market or Britain should leave altogether.

More and more power is being held by Brussels, to the fury of voters who find that major decisions are no longer taken by the UK government, Mr Johnson added.

‘In the meantime I suppose we can gratify our irritation by vetoing poor old Juncker – who always struck me as rather a nice chap.

‘But it is the quintessence of turd-polishing pointlessness. 

'It is like trying to swat a fly on the leg of the rhino that is standing on your chest. You can put lipstick on a pig, but it is still a cochon.’

IMF chief Christine Lagarde has ruled herself out of the race to run the Commission, insisting she is not a candidate.

Labour today announced it backed Mr Cameron's attempt to block Mr Junker from getting the EU's top job.

A Labour spokesman said: 'The nominee for European Commission president is ultimately a decision for the European Council, including David Cameron.

'Labour will not support Jean-Claude Juncker as a candidate for president of the European Commission. Should Mr Juncker be put before the European Parliament, Labour MEPs would vote against him.

'The message from the European elections was clear - that we need reform in Europe. We need reform so we can promote jobs and growth.

'Mr Juncker's record shows he would make these reforms more difficult.'

Angela Merkel is pushing for arch-federalist Jean-Claude Juncker (left) to become the new EC president, but IMF chief Christine Lagarde (second left) has emerged as a compromise candidate favoured by David Cameron. Other politicians in line for Europe's most powerful position include Danish PM Helle Thorning-Schmidt and Irish Taoiseach Enda Kenny

Jean-Claude Juncker is still the favourite to become the new European Commission President - replacing the outgoing former Portuguese Prime Minister Jose Manuel Barroso.

The former Luxembourg prime minister was chosen as the candidate for the top job by the European Parliament's main conservative group, the European People's Party.

The EPP emerged from last week's elections with the most seats - leaving Mr Junker in poll position for the EU's most powerful job.

But the Commission President is chosen by European leaders including David Cameron - and not by the Parliament. MEPs do however have to confirm the leaders' choice for the job in a vote.

The other candidates for the top EU job include the IMF chief Christine Lagarde.

Miss Lagarde was finance minister under former President Nicolas Sarkozy before moving to the IMF at the height of the euro zone's debt crisis in 2011 to replace disgraced French politician Dominique Strauss-Kahn. Her term runs until 2016.

A fluent English-speaker who headed a major US law firm before holding ministerial office in France, she is highly regarded by German leader Angela Merkel.

Center-left Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt is also under consideration. The former MEP is the daughter-in-law of Neil Kinnock, the ex Labour leader and European commissioner.

If Mrs Merkel was open to a French candidate for one of the top jobs, Paris might offer Socialist former Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault - a fluent German-speaker who was replaced in March but is well regarded in Berlin.

Another candidate for the EU Commission President is the current Irish Taoiseach Enda Kenny. The Fine Gael leader became Ireland's leader in 2011, so might be open to moving to Brussels.
