Alexander Graham Bell foresaw many things, including that people could someday talk over a telephone.

But the inventor certainly never could have anticipated that his audio-recording experiments in a Washington, D.C., lab could be recovered 130 years later and played for a gathering of scientists, curators and journalists.

'To be or not to be...' a man's voice can be heard saying in one recording as it was played on a computer at the Library of Congress yesterday.

The speaker from the 1880s recites a portion of Hamlet's Soliloquy as a green wax disc crackles to life from computer speakers.

Paving the way: Alexander Graham Bell's 1881 gramaphone, on which he recorded Hamlet's Soliloquy, a trill of the tongue and someone reciting numbers starting with 1-2-3

The early audio recordings - which revealed recitations of Shakespeare, numbers and other familiar lines - had been packed away and deemed obsolete at the Smithsonian Institution for more than a century. But new technology has allowed them to be recovered and played.

Brilliant mind: Alexander Graham Bell, the inventor of the telephone, laid down his recordings in the 1880s when he was in fierce competition with the likes of Thomas Edison

The technology reads the sound from tiny grooves with light and a 3D camera.

The recordings offer a glimpse into the dawn of the information age, when inventors were scrambling to make new discoveries and secure patents for the first telephones and phonographs, even early fiber optics.

A second recording, on a copper negative disc, played back reveals a trill of the tongue and someone reciting the numbers 1-2-3-4-5-6.

A third recording catches perhaps the first sound of disappointment as Bell's recording device seemed to hit a technical glitch.

'Mary had a little lamb and its fleece was white as snow,' a voice says. 'Everywhere that Mary went - Oh no!'

On Novenmber 17, 1884, Bell's lab 
recorded the word 'barometer' several times on a glass disc with a beam 
of light. It and about 200 other experimental records were packed up and
given to the Smithsonian, seemingly never to be played again.

The recordings date back to the 
1880s. Bell had moved from Boston, Massachusetts, to Washington after 
obtaining a patent on March 10, 1876, for his invention of the 
telephone, which occurred when his employee Thomas Watson heard him 
shouting over a wire in the next room. He joined a growing group of 
scientists who made the nation's capital a hotbed for innovations.

Brought to life: The recordings could not have been played up to ten years ago because the digital mapping technology wasn't available, scientists revealed

Bell partnered with his cousin Chichester Bell and Charles Sumner Tainter to create Volta Laboratory Associates in Washington in the early 1880s.

During this time, Bell sent the first wireless telephone message on a beam of light from the roof of a downtown Washington building, a forerunner to modern fiber optics.

He and other inventors also were scrambling to record sound on anything they could find, including glass, rubber and metal. One early sound record looks like a smashed soup can.

Inventors at the time were in intense
competition. Bell, Emile Berliner and Thomas Edison, who invented the 
phonograph to record sound on tin foil in 1877, each left objects and 
documentation with the Smithsonian to help prove their innovations were 
first.

Bell went so far as to seal some 
devices in tin boxes for safekeeping at the Smithsonian. Edison's 
earliest recordings are thought to have been lost.

'This stuff makes the hair stand up 
on the back of my neck,' said curator Carlene Stephens, of the National 
Museum of American History, before Bell's recordings were played. 'It's 
the past speaking directly to us in a way we haven't heard before.'

The museum's collection of about 400 
of the earliest audio recordings, including 200 from Bell's lab, 
probably will become an important resource for new research on 
communications and early technology now that they can be played back, 
Stephens said.

'These materials have been in a cupboard and virtually unknown for decades,' she said. 'The collection has been silent.'

Safe keeping: Many of the scientists, who were in keen competition to invent new instruments, gave their findings to the Smithsonian so that one day they could be proved correc

The Library of Congress partnered with the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory at the University of California, Berkeley, to offer the first listen of these early recordings. Scientists have spent the past 10 years and about $1million to develop the technology to create high-resolution digital scans of the sound discs.

This year, scholars from the Library of Congress, the Berkeley Lab and the Smithsonian gathered in a new preservation lab at the Library of Congress and recovered sound from those early Bell recordings.

A $600,000 three-year grant from the U.S. Institute of Museum and Library Sciences funded the pilot project, and the Smithsonian hopes to continue the work if future grants can be secured.

Advances in computer technology made it possible to play back the recordings, Haber said, noting that 10 years ago specialists would have struggled with computer speeds and storage problems. The digital images that now can be processed into sound within minutes would have taken days to process a decade ago.

Many of the recordings are fragile, and until recently it had not been possible to listen to them without damaging the discs or cylinders.

So far, the sounds of six discs have been successfully recovered through the process, which creates a high-resolution digital map of the disc or cylinder.

The map is processed to remove scratches and skips, and software reproduces the audio content to create a standard digital sound file.

Carl Haber, senior scientist at the Berkeley Lab, said Bell's recordings and others in the fierce competition of the 1880s marked the start of the information age as we know it.

'The whole idea that you could capture the world as it exists' in a recording, he said, 'they got that in this period.'
