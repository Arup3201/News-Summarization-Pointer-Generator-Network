Only one in five Britons work in the job they dreamed of as a child - less than in any other large country, it was revealed today.

As little boys and girls we fantasise about becoming pilots or doctors, but the overwhelming majority of us have failed to achieve our childhood aim.

Nonetheless, many people in the UK have refused to settle for a lesser career - as a third of Britons still hope to land that dream job.

In a survey conducted by networking website LinkedIn, just 21 per cent of the site's British users said they worked in the career they had wanted in their youth.

This places the UK bottom of the 17 countries surveyed - Indians topped the list, with 44 per cent saying they had the job they had always dreamed about in their youth.

Other English-speaking countries also did relatively poorly, with the U.S., Canada, Australia and New Zealand all scoring less than 30 per cent.

Ideal: British men fantasise about becoming pilots, while women are more likely to want to be doctors

5. Brazil - 32%

6. Austria - 31%

=13. Singapore, Hong Kong - 27%

15. Australia - 26%

16. New Zealand - 25%

17. UK - 21%

When LinkedIn asked its users which job they had most wanted in childhood, the results showed a marked gender divide.

British men said the career they had coveted most was to be an aeroplane pilot, followed by engineer, scientist or police officer.

Most women, by contrast, wanted to be a doctor or nurse, with teacher, writer and singer also high up the list.

Meanwhile, those in other countries have different aspirations - American men said they wanted to be Olympic athletes, while women in Sweden longed to become vets.

Britons may not be all that happy with their jobs, but they have not lost hope of improving their lot, with 32 per cent revealing they still dream of getting the career they always wanted.

When the 8,000 people surveyed in the UK were asked how they would define a dream job, the overwhelming majority - 75 per cent - said that 'taking pleasure in work' was the priority.

Nine per cent revealed their main aim was to help others, while five per cent said they longed for flexible working conditions.

'It's never too late to land your ideal job,' said Darain Faraz, a spokesman for LinkedIn spokesperson.

'LinkedIn is a great tool for helping you to find the right job for you and at the beginning of the year when we start to look for new challenges - it's the perfect place to start looking.'
