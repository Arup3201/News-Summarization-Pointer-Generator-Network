This is the adorable moment two Sumatran tigers really did earn their stripes - proving to their zookeepers they are safe to take a dip in the park's waters.

Cute cubs Bandar and Sukacita had to quickly learn to keep their heads above water, navigating their way to the shallow end of the pool before climbing onto dry land.

All tigers must prove they are capable of swimming as their zoo home is surrounded by a moat.

Bandar and Sukacita, who were born on August 5 this year, passed with flying colours meaning they are now ready to explore the yard with their mother, four-year-old Damai.

The pair are the first litter of cubs to be born at Smithsonian's National Zoo in Washington DC, USA, since 2006.

Sumatran tigers are listed as critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and it's estimated only 400 to 500 still exist in the wild.

Fun's over: A sodden Sukacita is hauled out of the water by two keepers. The cubs, who were born on August 5 this year, passed the swimming test with flying colours meaning they are now ready to explore the yard with their mother, four-year-old Damai

Can't catch me: Bandar gives keepers the slip and races off to explore his new home

Craig Saffoe, curator of Great Cats, said: 'Tigers are one of the few species of cats that enjoy taking a dip in water.

'The moat exists for the safety of our visitors but it could present an obstacle for young cats. Our job is to make sure if the cubs venture into the moat then they know how and where to get out.'

These cubs represent hope for their critically endangered species' future - so we need to take every precaution to ensure their survival.'

Cub Bandar seemed less than pleased after he was dunked however
