There was no chance of rain stopping play today as performers prepared for Britain's biggest Jubilee street party - a free concert for 10,000 to be held outside Buckingham Palace tonight.

Kylie Minogue donned a plastic poncho as she rehearsed her set in the rain ahead of tonight's spectacular, tweeting the words 'Jubilee rehearsals #wetwetwet' to her followers.

The concert will be headlined by ex-Beatle Paul McCartney, who was present at the soundcheck this afternoon, prompting concert organiser Gary Barlow to tweet that he felt like a 'complete beginner' next to the rock legend.

Also set to perform later tonight is a world-class line-up of musical stars including Sir Elton John, as well as current chart toppers Jessie J and Ed Sheeran.

Ten thousand tickets have been given away through a public ballot for the event, to be held outside Buckingham Palace.

MIllions more will be able to watch the musical extravaganza live on BBC1 or tune in on Radio 2.

Organised
 by Take That singer Gary Barlow, whose song released in honour of the 
Jubilee shot straight to number one on its release last night, it will 
showcase the best of pop, rock, classical and musical theatre from each 
decade of the monarch’s 60-year reign.

Gary Barlow took to Twitter today to express his excitement at the evening's event, and pay tribute to Paul McCartney, who he called a 'total legend', saying his rehearsal set made him 'feel like a complete beginner'.

Preparations: The concert stage is erected outside Buckingham Palace, with giant screens position along the Mall for those not lucky enough to win one of the 10,000 tickets given away for the event

Crowds on the Mall soak up the atmosphere today ahead of the concert tonight at Buckingham Palace

A unique concert stage has been 
designed to encircle the stunning gold-encrusted Queen Victoria Memorial
 which stands at the front of the palace with seating either side.

Giant screens will also be erected in the nearby Mall for 
members of the public not lucky enough to secure tickets to watch.

Gary, 41, has a strong line-up of 
artists but he is particularly happy that he has managed to secure the 
services of one of England's most successful musicians ever - Paul 
McCartney.

He said his 
experience of the Queen's Silver Jubilee in 1977 when he was a boy was 
of everyone coming together to celebrate: 'That's what we're trying to 
do here, make this concert all-encompassing for everyone involved, 
that's why I was so keen on moving it out of the back of the palace... 
and out the front.'

The singer added that this would 
enable crowds to congregate in The Mall and nearby Green Park to share 
the event he believes will attract 500,000 people.

'With Buckingham Palace as a backdrop, it's going to be a fantastic event which transcends multiple decades of music.'

King of tickets: Gary Barlow is helping to organise the massive concert, which will be headlined by Sir Paul McCartney

The
 Never Forget singer added the monarchy was scratching their heads to 
come up with something 'newer and better' to top Queen guitarist Brian 
May's scene-stealing performance at the Golden Jubilee concert in 2002, 
when he played the national anthem on the palace roof.

Sir Paul, 69, will not be the only knight of the realm to perform for Her Royal Highness.

Sir Elton John, Sir Cliff Richard, and Sir Tom Jones are also on the bill as is Dame Shirley Bassey.

Modern
 day artists such as Jessie J, JLS, and Ed Sheeran will be performing 
and Gary revealed that some of the younger royals had made requests for 
some of their favourite bands.

With an estimated audience of  just 
over 10,000 people, the Duke of Cambridge, Prince Harry, and other 
members of the Royal Family will be in a special section to watch the 
show.

Guests have been invited to arrive from 
around 3.30pm to allow them to picnic in the palace gardens beforehand, 
despite the inclement weather.
