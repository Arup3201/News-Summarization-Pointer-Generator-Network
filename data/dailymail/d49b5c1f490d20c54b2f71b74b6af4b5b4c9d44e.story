A woman suffered serious burns to her legs when she was caught in an explosion in a toilet cubicle.

The woman had to undergo skin graft operations on both her legs after the methane gas explosion at a bar in Barcelona's gothic quarter.

The explosion is thought to have been caused by a lack of ventilation and cleanliness in the toilet cubicle.

A woman suffered second and third degree burns when the toilet she was sitting on exploded. When she switched on the light, a spark ignited methane gas in the cubicle, which built up as a result of poor ventilation

The woman is reported to have taken action against bar in Barcelona's Gothic Quarter, after police revealed the blast was thought to be caused by unhygienic conditions

The woman suffered second and third degree burns to her legs when the toilet she was sitting on exploded from underneath her.

The Local reported police believe the blast was ignited by the unhygienic conditions of the septic tank and the lack of ventilation in the cubicle.

When the woman switched on the light, a spark ignited methane gas which had filled the toilet.

Because the woman was sitting down, the gas was compressed, causing a stronger blast.

According to Catalunya Radio, the woman has since sued the owners of the bar for the serious injuries she sustained.
