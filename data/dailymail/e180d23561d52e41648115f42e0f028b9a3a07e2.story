A 13-year-old boy who was trying to change a flat tire alongside a Tennessee highway has died after being struck by a hit-and-run driver.

Tennessee Highway Patrol Sgt. Bill Miller says Clifton Braunwalder, of Lascassas, died on Thursday after he and his mother, Sondra Braunwalder, 47, were both struck down by a passing car.

The two were on Interstate 24 under the Sam Ridly Parkway overpass in Smyrna, switching the tires on their Chevrolet Cavalier, when a 2003 Oldsmobile Alero lost control while changing lanes.

The car veered off the road and struck Clifton and his then mother.

Tragic: Clifton Braunwalder, 13, was helping his mother change a tire on the side of a highway in Smyrna, Tennessee, when a car lost control and ran into them. Clifton died in hospital. The driver did not stop.

Charged: Tina L. Wilson, 33, was arrested Friday in connection to the hit and run death of Clifton Braunwalder. Police were able to find Wilson because a witness to the incident followed her home

Scene: Wilson's car is alleged to have struck Clifton Braunwalder and then hit Sondra S. Braunwalder, 47, Clifton's mom, before fleeing the scene

The car didn't stop and kept driving.

The two victims were taken to hospital, where Clifton was pronounced dead.

His mother suffered non-life threatening injuries, according to WSMV.

'Our hearts and prayers go out to her. She witnessed this,' Sgt Miller said.

'Their mother 
witnessed this.

'They lost a family member due to a driver not exercising
 full control.'

A Good Samaritan who witnessed the hit and run followed the car involved to Davidson Country and contacted police.

Tina L. Wilson, 33, was arrested at her Murfreesboro home on Friday 
morning on charges of vehicular homicide and aggravated vehicular 
assault.

She was booked into the Rutherford County jail and was released early
 Friday morning on bond, before she was arrested again Friday around 7 
am.

Her second arrest is likely to have been spawned by the return of toxicology reports, however police have not yet said if Wilson's charges have been changed.

Clifton Braunwalder was home-schooled by his mother but a very active member of the area, regularly attending church, Scouts and playing football

The family were driving from their Lascassas home to Nashville to hear a speaker when the incident occurred on Thursday

A vigil was organized at the Braunwalder family church, St. Rose of Lima 
Catholic Church in Murfreesboro, on Thursday night to remember Clifton.

'His family was a home school family, yet they were 
very involved in the parish here - Knights of Columbus, Heart of Mary, 
Boy Scouts â€“ you name it, the Braunwalders did it,' said Julie Manke, a 
family friend.

The Braunwalders were driving from their Lascassas home to Nashville to hear a speaker.

'They were such a renaissance family, very talented in a lot of ways,' said Manke.

'The whole parish is devastated.'
