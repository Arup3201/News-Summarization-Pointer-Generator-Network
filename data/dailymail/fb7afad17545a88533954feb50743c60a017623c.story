Claims by sacked Tory MP Tim Yeo that he was the victim of a witch-hunt by anti-gay marriage Tory fanatics in his rural Suffolk constituency have been dismissed as ‘tosh’ by his leading local critic.

Mr Yeo, who was deselected after a ballot of local party activists earlier this month, blamed Conservative ‘extremists’ angry with him for supporting same-sex marriage.

But the claim backfired last night when the man who led opposition to Mr Yeo revealed that his son is gay and will be among the first in Suffolk to have a same-sex wedding.

Simon Barrett, deputy chairman of the Suffolk Tory association, said his son Oliver, a doctor, is to marry his partner, a male nurse, in December.

Businessman Mr Barrett, 55, said last night: ‘Tim Yeo is talking a  load of tosh. Just because we live in  Suffolk does not mean we all chew turnips and are homophobic.

‘No father could be more proud of his son than I am of Oliver. It will be one of the proudest days in my life when I attend his wedding to his boyfriend Jonathan in December.

‘Mr Yeo is making excuses. The reason he was deselected is that he has been absent. We hardly ever see him and people got sick of it. To claim it is because we are anti same-sex marriage is laughable – and wrong.’

Mr Barrett’s wife Alison died in 2001, leaving him to bring up two sons and two daughters aged between nine and 16 as a single father.

Oldest child Oliver, now 29, qualified as a doctor and works as a registrar in an accident and emergency department in Sydney, Australia. His partner Jonathan Roberts is a New Zealander.

On December 22, three days before Oliver turns 30 on Christmas Day, they will marry in Sudbury register office, a stone’s throw from Mr Yeo’s local party HQ.

Same-sex marriage becomes legal next month.

‘It will be a wonderful day,’ said Mr Barrett, who is now married again, to Melanie.

‘All my family and friends are delighted. I have not heard a single anti-gay comment from any of them.’ Mr Yeo, 68, was deselected amid ongoing controversy after it emerged he earned vast sums thanks to the green energy policies he was promoting in Parliament. After a sting by journalists, the Commons sleaze watchdog last year cleared him of breaking parliamentary rules.

Local Conservatives complained that keen golfer Mr Yeo was rarely present in his Suffolk constituency – preferring to spend time at his home next door to the famous Royal St George’s Golf Club in Sandwich, Kent, more than 100 miles from his constituency, or at a £2.2 million  riverside apartment in London.

The Mail on Sunday revealed how, at a showdown with local Tories,  Mr Yeo pretended to be rebuffing phone calls from Downing Street. He told his audience he was too busy to speak to the Prime Minister, though it later emerged he had apparently merely set the alarm on his phone.

Asked why he was thrown out after 30 years as an MP, he said: ‘Clearly there were some issues on which I may have had disagreements with them.

‘I voted in favour of gay marriage – that wasn’t a universally held view among my members.

‘We have a shrinking membership, which means you tend to get predominantly among those remaining activists people with probably more extreme views than the average Conservative voter on issues like the EU and gay marriage.’

But Mr Yeo’s own equality credentials have come under fire in gay rights publication Pink News, which has claimed he missed 13 votes on gay equality and opposed an equal age of consent.
