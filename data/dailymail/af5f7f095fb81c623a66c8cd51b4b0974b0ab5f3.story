THE BBC faces a bitter battle with high-profile stars over plans to add more than 100 broadcasters to the staff books to end suspicions of tax avoidance.

They are currently paid via controversial ‘personal service companies’ which the corporation yesterday admitted give individuals a ‘greater opportunity’ to reduce their tax liability.

Figures released yesterday in a review of how the BBC pays its stars show that at least 124 top names earn £150,000 or more via the companies. Another 54 freelance stars receive a similar amount.

Some of the BBC's highest earners, reportedly including Fiona Bruce, left, and Jeremy Paxman, right, have been employed by the corporation on a freelance basis as PSCs

The BBC has now identified 131 employees – either currently paid via the service companies or on freelance contracts – who will be asked to go on the payroll and taxed at source.

This could mean stars such as Fiona Bruce, Jeremy Paxman and Sophie Raworth are told to become employees.

Both Miss Bruce and Paxman have said they were told by bosses to set up the companies in order to receive their salaries.

Last night a leading agent for BBC talent said performers, with backing from their accountants, would fight being put on staff.

The agent said many would be able to prove they earn a large proportion of their money through after-dinner speaking, corporate work, writing and appearances outside the BBC.

In addition, it emerged the BBC could end up having to increase some stars’ pay to make up for the change in circumstances.

Currently, people paid through service companies are allowed to deduct up to five per cent in management expenses in calculating their tax liabilities.

The shake-up comes after months of the BBC defending its tax arrangements, in the face of increasing anger from MPs who said using  the companies generated a suspicion of ‘complicity’ in tax avoidance.

The review – ordered by the BBC Trust and carried out by accountancy firm Deloitte – was critical of ‘weaknesses’ and ‘inconsistency’ in the BBC’s approach.

Other staff working for the BBC in a PSC arrangement are reported to include Sophie Raworth, right and Emily Maitlis, pictured left.

It pointed out that staff with similar jobs were being paid in three different ways: some as staff, some as freelancers and others via the controversial companies.

Yesterday the corporation said if someone ‘displays the characteristics’ of being a staff member, he or she would have to go on the payroll.

This means presenters and actors will be subjected to an employment test, which will look at the proportion of income earned at the BBC, their ‘length of engagement’, certainty of work provided by the BBC and the extent to which the corporation ‘exercises control’ over them.

The BBC’s chief finance officer Zarin Patel indicated that if about 70 to 80 per cent of someone’s income was at the corporation it would be likely they would be regarded as staff.

After the employment test is applied to the highest earners it will then be broadened to include all workers.

The working arrangements of more than 800 'on air' stars at the BBC will be urgently reviewed

The review found ‘no evidence of a BBC policy to engage with tax/national insurance avoidance’. But it said about one in six of the 804 people paid more than £50,000 a year via ‘personal service companies’ or who were self-employed, should be given traditional employment contracts.

The review also predicted use of these service companies would become ‘considerably fewer than at present’.

When asked if the corporation would force reluctant stars on to staff contracts, BBC Trust member Anthony Fry said there would be ‘no exceptions’. He said: ‘If someone clearly has the characteristics of being an employee... there will not be exceptions because someone is a big talent.’

Yesterday the BBC’s talent managers contacted around 45 of its stars to take them through the details of the new arrangements.

Senior BBC insiders have predicted difficult conversations with stars who are reluctant to be put back on staff.
