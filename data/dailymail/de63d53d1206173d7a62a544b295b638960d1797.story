A confident Duchess of Cornwall nearly stole the show as she arrived looking wonderful in a regal white gown and diamond tiara that echoed the Queen's ensemble in Westminster today.

Just over a year since she made her debut appearance at the State Opening of Parliament, her repeat visit today will be seen as a victory for Prince Charles who has long wanted his wife to play a greater role in royal life.

And it seems his work has paid off after a radiant Camilla drew admiring glances and loud cheers from the crowds outside the Palace of Westminster as she made her way inside on her husband's arm.

The past month has been a difficult one for Camilla, who is still struggling to come to terms with the sudden death of her brother Mark Shand at the end of April.

But instead of retreating to her country home, the Duchess has thrown herself into royal duties and yesterday joined the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh for a garden party at Buckingham Palace.

Today, glamorous in a white gown, traditional sash and a diamond tiara, the Duchess looked every inch the princess, although even she couldn't eclipse the Queen, who wore the magnificent Imperial State Crown as she made her address to Parliament.

With 2,868 diamonds, 273 pearls, 17 sapphires, 11 emeralds, and five rubies, the crown, which was made for the coronation of George VI in 1937, is one of the most important of the Crown Jewels.

Based on an earlier version made for Queen Victoria, the crown also boasts several famous jewels, among them King Edward's Sapphire which was taken from a ring belonging to the Anglo-Saxon king and builder of the first Westminster Abbey, Edward the Confessor.

The most important of all the Queen's crowns, the current Imperial State Crown was made in 1937 and boasts 2,868 diamonds, 273 pearls, 17 sapphires, 11 emeralds, and five rubies.

Although there has been an Imperial State Crown since the 15th century, there have been several different versions with the current one based on Queen Victoria's.

Among the jewels is the sapphire of King Edward the Confessor, the Anglo-Saxon king who founded Westminster Abbey.

Joining the Queen and Camilla at the Houses of Parliament were Prince Charles, who sported a traditional military uniform, and a cheerful-looking Duke of Edinburgh.

The royal party arrived after the traditional ceremonial procession from Buckingham Palace to the Palace of Westminster, which also saw the debut of the new Diamond Jubilee State Coach.

The vehicle, which contains fragments from Henry VIII's doomed battleship, the Mary Rose, a bullet from the Battle of Waterloo and a piece of Newton's apple tree, boasts diamond doorhandles and a hidden 'Queen cam' which offers a 360 degree view of the crowds.

Among the other historical mementos incorporated into the coach are slivers from Scott’s Antarctic sled, a part of Hut Six, which was one of several used at codebreaking centre Bletchley Park, and a piece of Scotland’s Stone of Destiny, upon which monarchs are traditionally crowned.

The state opening of Parliament marks the start of a busy few days for the Queen, who tomorrow will travel to France for a state visit. Accompanied by the Duke of Edinburgh, the monarch will travel to Paris by Eurostar and will be welcomed by French president François Hollande at the Arc de Triomphe.

Later, the Queen will travel to the Elysée Palace for meetings with France's socialist head of state ahead of a garden party at the British Ambassador's residence in Paris.

The following day, the Queen will join the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall in Normandy for a series of visits commemorating the 70th anniversary of the D-Day landings, before returning to the Elysée Palace for a state dinner.
