Not impressed: New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said it would be a 'shame' for voters to elect Anthony Weiner mayor

New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has delivered a powerful blow to Anthony Weiner's political ambitions, saying it would be a 'shame' for voters to elect him mayor.

Cuomo made the cutting remark in an interview with the Syracuse Post-Standard's editorial board, where he was asked what he thought of Weiner's campaign.

'He runs? He runs,' Cuomo said.

'And if we elect him?' the governor was asked.

'Shame on us,' Cuomo bluntly replied.

Cuomo's unflattering opinion of Weiner was 
revealed on the eve of the former congressman's first official day of 
campaigning.

'There’s no doubt about it: I made 
very big mistakes,' Weiner, 48, told WNYC Thursday, referring to the tawdry tweets 
that led to his resignation from Congress in 2011. 'I compounded it immeasurably by being dishonest about
it.

'I have apologized 
many, many times to my wife, and frankly I know that part of this 
process is going to be doing a lot of apologizing.'

Weiner
resigned from Congress after it was revealed that he had sent several 
women inappropriate photos of himself, including one of a bulge in his 
pants and another of him shirtless.

He called 
the behavior a 'blind spot' and said 'it was a thoughtlessness that I 
had about my private behavior.'

Weiner's wife, longtime Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin, has forgiven him - but she hasn't forgotten, he revealed.

'I
put her through some difficult things,' Weiner admitted. 'She says it’s
in the rear view mirror — but it’s not far in the rear view mirror.'

But that might change if more details of the scandal come forward in the course of his campaign - something Weiner has repeatedly warned could happen.

'It is what it is,' Weiner said. 'People may decide they want to come forward and say, here’s another email that I got or another photo. I’m certainly not going to do that. So people may hear things that are true, they may hear things that are not true, but I’m going to try to keep being focused on issues that are important to New York City.'

Weiner made the remarks as he set out
Thursday to reintroduce himself to voters, following the release of his
first official campaign video that featured his toddler son and 
targeted middle class voters.

He
started off his day of rebranding at a subway stop in Harlem, where he 
shook hands with voters and answered their questions about teacher 
contracts and manufacturing jobs - the kind issues that wants to be 
central to his campaign.

Anthony Weiner and his wife Huma Abedin appeared in a New York Times magazine article last month in which he revealed that he was considering running for mayor

Voter Linda Smalls, who encountered Weiner during his swing through Harlem, said the former congressman has her support.

'Even though he made a mistake, you 
know, we're human. He's human. He apologized for it, and it's time to 
move on,' she told the Associated Press.

Addressing a throng reporters was 
following him, Weiner said that he would be happy to talk about his 
'personal failings' if that is what citizens on the campaign trail want 
to discuss.

'[But] frankly, I think most New 
Yorkers, particularly those in the middle class in communities like 
this, they want to talk about the solutions to the challenges that New 
York City faces,' he said. 'That's what they care about and I want to 
try to provide some answers.'

A
recent Quinnipiac University poll has Weiner coming in second place 
among Democratic primary contenders with 15 percent of the vote. Ahead 
of him is City Council Speaker Christine Quinn, with 25 percent of the 
vote.

In his 'comeback' video released late Tuesday, Weiner says he's learned 'tough lessons.'

'I’ve
been fighting for the middle class and those struggling to make it my 
entire life,' he says. 'And I hope I get a second chance to work for 
you.'

In an interview last month with New York Times Magazine, Abedin explained her decision to stick by her husband's side.

'Here
was a man I respected, I loved, was the father of this child inside of 
me, and he was asking me for a second chance,' said Abedin, who was 
pregnant with their first child at the time of the scandal. 'It was the 
right choice for me. I didn’t make it lightly.'
