Gary Lineker thinks Roy Hodgson should seriously consider dropping Wayne Rooney from England's starting line-up in Brazil.

The former Barcelona and Tottenham striker, who scored 48 times in 80 appearances for England, said that Hodgson shouldn't be afraid to leave Rooney out of the side.

Lineker, who tweeted a picture of him with Frank De Boer on a beach, wants Daniel Sturridge to play as the most advanced striker for England in Brazil.

Conundrum: Lineker thinks that Roy Hodgson shouldn't be afraid to leave Wayne Rooney out of the team

He said on Blahzil 2014: 'I think Sturridge gives us different options, He gives us a threat in behind the opposition which I think is very important. That's something that Rooney doesn't do as often. 

'He (Rooney) is very good at coming off, creating space, turning, hitting shots hard and bringing other people into the game, but in terms of a threat in behind the opposition defence, that is Sturridge's territory.'

But, while Lineker thinks the Liverpool striker should play up front, he admits that it could be difficult to find a place for Rooney to slot into.

Make way: Rooney could be dropped in favour of other players such as Raheem Sterling

Lineker said: 'You’ve got the conundrum – if Sturridge is up top in the system, where do you play Rooney? Wayne can play anywhere. He can play on the right, he can play on the left, he can even play a forward midfield role.

'But the question then is, "Have you better players in those particular positions than Wayne Rooney?" We’ve got all sorts of options. You could have [Raheem] Sterling playing on one side, the possibility of [Adam] Lallana playing on either side, [Danny] Welbeck, of course, which has been favoured by Roy in his teams and you’d expect him to play on the left-hand side because he covers a lot of ground.

'It will be interesting to see which way Roy Hodgson goes. Or whether he sets back to that old way we played two years ago against Italy, with two lines of four, Rooney and someone else up top. So all sorts of possibilities. It will be fascinating to see which way he goes.'
