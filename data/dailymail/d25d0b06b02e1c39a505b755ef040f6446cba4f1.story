The customized Captain America chopper Peter Fonda rode in Easy Rider is up for auction this weekend in Calabasas, CA.

Or is it?

Gordon Granger of Texas says he bought the original Easy Rider motorcycle in 1996 from Dan Haggerty, an actor with a bit part in the 1960s counterculture classic.

Both that red, white and blue bike and the one headed for auction Saturday have certificates of authenticity signed by Haggerty. 

But the actor acknowledged to the Los Angeles Times this week that he has authenticated and sold two Captain America bikes.

Which one's a phony? Collector Michael Eisenberg (pictured September 4) insists that his customized Captain America chopper is the same one Peter Fonda rode in Easy Rider, but collector Gordon Granger insists that he owns the original motorbike

Actor Peter Fonda is reluctant to take sides as he says he doesn't have enough expertise to make a judgement between the bikes 

Now Haggerty says just one of the bikes is legitimate, and it's Michael Eisenberg's — the one going up for sale Saturday with a $1 million minimum.

For his part, Fonda says he has no idea which bike is the real one.

'There's a big rat stinking someplace in this,' said the 74-year-old actor, who co-wrote Easy Rider. He hopes the weekend sale by auction house Profiles in History is called off.

Eisenberg, a Los Angeles real estate agent and collector of Hollywood memorabilia, bought his chopper earlier this year from John Parham, a Midwestern motorcycle parts magnate who had purchased the bike from Haggerty 12 years earlier.

Eisenberg insists his bike is the real one, because Haggerty says it is.

Fonda signed one Harley's gas tank before he knew that there was as controversy over authenticity

Haggerty did not deny that he signed Granger's authenticating documents but now says he signed something that simply was not true

'Dan Haggerty is the only guy who knows,' Eisenberg said.

Haggerty did not deny that he signed Granger's authenticating documents. He now says he signed something that simply was not true.

'That was my mistake,' Haggerty said. 'It's not the real bike.'

'There's a big rat stinking someplace in this': Even the 74-year-old Oscar nominee, who wrote and starred in the 1960s classic, hopes that Profiles in History cancels the auction

Granger, furious at the prospect of this weekend's auction, insists he owns the genuine article.

'They know damn well they don't have the real bike,' Granger said. 'I own the original remaining Captain America bike. The one to be auctioned is a replica.'

The chopper features a forward-angled front wheel and handlebars, fishtail exhaust pipes and a teardrop-shaped gas tank where the movie's protagonists stashed their cash. It was designed with input from Fonda who insisted on it being decorated with the American flag.

Easy Rider was a 1969 road film about two drug-using, long-haired bikers, Wyatt (Fonda) and Billy (Dennis Hopper), who go on a cross-country odyssey to New Orleans in search of personal freedom and easy money.

Four motorcycles were created for the movie, but only one is known to have survived. It was used in the climactic crash scene in which Fonda is thrown off the bike.

Fonda sketched the original design but doesn't want to take a side.

'I'm no expert, and I can't tell you which one is real,' he said. 'I know there are two bikes out there that are both authenticated by Haggerty. That's not right.' 

However he did authenticate the bike up for auction after a brief examination and even signed its gas tank.

He says that until a few years ago when he learned to the other possible Captain America motorcycle he had no reason to doubt Haggerty's word.

Now he regrets endorsing the bike.

'It's embarrassing, and infuriating,' he said. 

He hopes the weekend auction is cancelled.
