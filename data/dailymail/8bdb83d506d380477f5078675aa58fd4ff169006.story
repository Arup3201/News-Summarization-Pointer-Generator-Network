Around half a million homeowners in Britain are 'property millionaires' – a rise of 60 per cent in just one year.

There are more than 10,000 streets across the country where the average property price is seven figures.

There is even one street in London where the 'average' price of a home is nearly £43million.

Although the value of many homes, particularly in the North, is far below what they were worth before the economic crisis began, the number of 'property millionaires' has ballooned.

More than 10,000 streets across the country have an average property price of seven figures, a new study has found

Property website Zoopla said there were just under 200,000 'property millionaires', whose homes were worth a million or more, in 2009. Today there are 484,081, up from 300,142 last year.

Unsurprisingly, London dominates the 'property millionaires' list. Of the 10,613 streets with an average price of more than £1milllion, 3,744 are in the capital.

Other hotspots – all in the South of England – include Ascot in Berkshire; Guildford, Leatherhead, Woking and Esher in Surrey; and Sevenoaks in Kent.

The capital is home to Kensington Palace Gardens next to Kensington Palace, which has been dubbed 'Billionaire's Row', not least because the average property price there is £42.7million.

Figures show in London, the average price is at an all-time high of £499,000

Parents who want their children to attend the country's best state schools can pay a premium of up to £500,000 to buy a home nearby.

A report shows homes close to top secondary schools are often considerably more expensive than those in other areas of the same county.

The most extreme example is Beaconsfield High School in Buckinghamshire, where the average price of nearby properties is £797,000, compared with £314,000 in the rest of the county. This means the 'school premium' is £483,000 – the highest in England.

Homes near Bishop Vesey's Grammar School, Sutton Coldfield, typically cost £299,000, while the average price in the West Midlands is £167,000.

The report, from banking giant Lloyds, said the average top school premium is £21,000.

Researchers looked at the best performing state secondary schools across England based on 2013's GCSE results.

Many oversubscribed schools have admissions policies which favour those living closest.

This is 162 times the value of the average British home, currently £263,705, according to Zoopla's estimate. Young couples and families looking to move are being forced to take on crippling mortgage debts in order to get on the property ladder or climb it, especially in London.

Official figures revealed there is more mortgage debt in south-west London than there is in the whole of Wales.

In London, the average price is at an all-time high of £499,000, according to figures published recently by the Office for National Statistics.

Outside the capital, Zoopla's report says the highest proportion of property millionaires live in the Surrey town of Virginia Water where the average price is £1.19million.

Other expensive areas include the Buckinghamshire towns of Beaconsfield and Chalfont St Giles, as well as Cobham and Weybridge in Surrey.

Lawrence Hall of Zoopla said London is an area which can charge 'stratospheric price tags'. But he added: 'You don't need to be a billionaire to get a chance to own the creme de la creme of property on offer. In Wales and the North East, you can still snap up a prime property in the region's most desirable streets for little over £1million.'

A separate report, from estate agents Douglas & Gordon, also published today, said property values in the capital are 'unlikely to fall dramatically'.

Ed Mead, an executive director of the chain, said: 'Sellers remain in control. Our offices report that the majority of their sellers are unwilling to reduce asking prices.

'Given the equity rich environment, many can afford to wait and watch.'
