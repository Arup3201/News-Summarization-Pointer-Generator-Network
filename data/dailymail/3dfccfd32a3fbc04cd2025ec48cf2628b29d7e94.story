Alexis Sanchez's confidence is suffering because he is not yet fully fit, according to Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger.

The £30million summer signing, who arrived from Barcelona after the World Cup, started up-front for the Gunners against Everton but was withdrawn at half-time after a lacklustre display.

Sanchez is likely to lead the line against Besiktas in next week's Champions League play-off second leg, but Wenger has admitted that he had no option but to substitute him at Goodison Park.

More to come: Wenger says his £30million summer signing is not yet 'ready physically'

'At the moment he is not completely ready physically,' Wenger said.

'He knows he is not at his best physically but when he is his confidence will come back.'

The Chilean could get another chance to impress in a central role against the Turks after his replacement, Olivier Giroud, injured his ankle at the end of the game.

The Frenchman scored his side's equaliser as Arsenal fought back to draw a 2-2 draw, with Wenger singling him out for special praise.

He said: 'We looked much more dangerous (after Giroud came on).

'I knew we were dominating the game in the second half and we needed some physical presence up front. That presence was very important. He had a very good second half.'

On the prospect of Giroud missing next Wednesday's tie against Slaven Bilic's side, Wenger added: 'It is a big game and I hope we have not lost him,' said Wenger of Giroud, who left Goodison Park with a protective boot on his left foot.

'In the final minute he stretched his ankle. At the moment it doesn't look too good. '
