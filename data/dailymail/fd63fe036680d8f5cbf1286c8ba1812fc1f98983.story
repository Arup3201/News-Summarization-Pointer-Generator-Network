Shrien Dewani could be cleared of the honeymoon murder of his new bride and be on his way back to Britain within days, according to one of South Africa's top legal experts.

The state's case against the wealthy businessman is 'riddled with inconsistencies' and could collapse before Dewani, 34, even has to face tough questions in the witness box.

Leading defence attorney William Booth said the two 'star' state witnesses against the accused had been particularly 'poor' and his legal team had a 'more than reasonable' chance of having all charges against him dropped.

A South African legal expert says the state's case against Shrien Dewani (left) is 'riddled with inconsistencies' and could collapse. Dewani is accused of arranging the murder of his wife Dewani (right) four years ago

Dewani denies five charges relating to the death of his new bride, Anni, almost four years ago during their honeymoon to South Africa. The state alleges he plotted her murder by recruiting a taxi driver to organise two hitmen to kill and rob her in a fake carjacking worth £850 (R15,000).

The driver, Zola Tongo – who spent his sixth day on the stand  – is the only state witness whose evidence directly implicates Bristol-based Dewani in his Swedish wife's death in November 2010.

But during gruelling cross-examination, Dewani's defence team managed to blast a number of holes in Tongo's story, highlighting discrepancies between his evidence from the witness box and his statement to police a week after Mrs Dewani suffered a fatal gun shot wound to the neck. 

Francois van Zyl, who heads the defence team, also highlighted that the taxi driver received a substantially lower jail term for his role in the killing in exchange for implicating Dewani in the murder.

Mr van Zyl also poked holes in the evidence of hitman Mziwamadoda Qwabe, hired by Tongo via a middle-man, who was the state's second witness and also received reduced prison time in exchange for giving evidence against Dewani.

Mr Booth said: 'The two key witnesses - Tongo and Qwabe - have brought really the only testimony that counts in this trial and the quality of their evidence has been poor and riddled with inconsistencies.

'The overall quality of the prosecution case we have heard so far has not been high. There is nothing for the defence team to lose by bringing the application to have the case against their client discharged and I think they would have a strong reasons for doing so.

'If Dewani were my client, I would certainly go down that route.'

Even though the state is not duty bound to prove Dewani had a motive for killing his wife, evidence of the businessman's secret gay life was a cornerstone of the prosecution's case to demonstrate he had a compelling reason to want out of his new marriage.

However, much of that evidence went unheard when Judge Jeanette Traverso ruled in favour of Dewani to exclude much of the testimony of three key witnesses - including the gay escort paid by Dewani and known as the German Master and the first cousin in whom Anni Dewani had confided intimate details about their unhappy relationship.

Mr Booth said he rated the defence team's chance of any discharge application as 'more than reasonable', which would see Dewani going home to Bristol and cleared of all charges without ever having to give his version of what happened on the night his wife was murdered.

'Discharging a case is not something that judges do lightly, but Judge Jeanette Traverso is a bold judge and she does not tend to be cautious.

'The high-profile nature of the case would not influence her decision. I think if they brought a discharge application, the chance of success is more than reasonable, ' Mr Booth added.

If no discharge application is brought - or the judge rules that Dewani does have a case to answer - the defence team will have to decide whether or not to call the businessman to the witness box to talk about the mysterious events surrounding his wife's killing, and to be cross-examined by the state. This poses a further dilemma to Dewani's lawyers.

'Bringing an application to discharge the case is a much easier decision to make than the one about whether or not to call your client to give evidence,' Mr Booth added.

'Although it is not down to him to prove his innocence, a judge can choose to draw conclusions from the fact that an accused chooses not to give evidence in his own defence.'

The driver, Zola Tongo – who spent his sixth day on the stand – is the only state witness whose evidence directly implicates Bristol-based Dewani in his Swedish wife's death in November 2010

Mr van Zyl said he had 'not yet decided' if he would make a discharge application, under section 174 of South Africa's Criminal Procedure Act.

The prosecution is expected to call just two or three more witnesses, two of them police officers. Middleman Monde Mbolombo, who was approached by Tongo to recruit killers to carry out the contract hit, is expected to be called next by the state.

Mbolombo was given immunity from prosecution in return for giving evidence against Tongo and hit men Qwabe and Xolile Mngeni, who died two weeks ago while serving 18 years for his part in the killing.

However, last week it emerged in court that Mbolombo had recently made a fresh statement to police about the events of 13 November 2010 – it is not known if this new version helps or hinders Dewani's defence.

Anni was found shot dead in an abandoned minibus

But since Mbolombo never met and spoke to Dewani directly, it is likely his team will try to have his testimony entirely excluded as heresay or severely restricted.

Certainly, the body language of Dewani and his family, who have been in court every day, has lightened since the trial began a month ago.

On the first day, Dewani's lawyer read out an 'explanation of plea' to the court in which Dewani claimed to be bi-sexual and admitted using the services of gay prostitutes, including festish specialist Leopold Leisser, surfing gay porn sites and frequenting gay clubs.

The admission, which followed previous Dewani denials of being gay and threats to sue Mr Leisser for giving an interview about their sex sessions, undermined the prosecution's case that his parallel life and fear of being found out prompted him to take extreme measures to be free of his wife.

It also enabled the defence team to argue that Dewani's sexuality - no longer in dispute - should have no bearing on the case against him. 

As a consequence, Mr Leisser was flown from Britain to give just a few minutes' uncontested testimony, and a bundle of 53 sexually-charged emails sent to Dewani from an unidentified older male lover were also excluded as evidence.

A source close to the case observed, 'Dewani was unable to be extradited from Britain for three years due to his high levels of trauma and depression, but within four months of arriving in South Africa, he was cleared by the doctors as fit to stand trial.

'Does this mean that doctors in South Africa can work miracles, or is it because he was sufficiently reassured by his legal team that the case against him was weak and they advised him just to get the trial over and done with?'

Meanwhile, with the fourth anniversary of the Swedish engineer's brutal murder a little over a week ago, the question about why Anni Dewani was killed appears no closer to being answered - a terrible blow to her parents Nilam and Vinod, and brother, Anish, who have sat through every minute of the case so far.

The trial continues.
