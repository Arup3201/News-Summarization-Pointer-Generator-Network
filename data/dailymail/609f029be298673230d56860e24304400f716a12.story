The stepmother of an Oregon boy whose 2010 disappearance sparked an intense and widespread search is again trying to persuade a judge to let her change her name.

Terri Moulton Horman made a similar request in August, saying she wanted to start a new life and avoid the stigma attached to the disappearance of Kyron Horman.

The seven-year-old went missing in June 2010 after she dropped him off at his Portland school.

Terri Horman wants to change her name to Claire Kisiel after her step-son, Kyron Horman, vanished from his Portland school four years ago. Kyron is seen here with his biological mom, Desiree Young

A major search came up empty.

Investigators have focused on Horman, but she has never been charged.

Kyron Horman’s biological parents and others have said they suspect Moulton Horman of being involved in the disappearance of her  stepson.

She asked a Lane County judge last week to change her name to Claire Kisiel.

The Register-Guard reports the request will be considered December 11.

In August she tried to change her name to Claire Stella Sullivan, saying it would allow her to start life over, the Roseburg News-Review reported at the time.

The child’s father, Kaine Horman, filed for divorce from Moulton Horman a few weeks after Kyron went missing. 

'After being divorced for six months, I decided I wanted to start my new life under a new name,' she said.

Four people involved in search efforts for the boy and fundraisers objected in court, saying Terri Horman hadn't answered questions about him.

'Kyron doesn't have a voice... I don't understand how that's fair,' said Vernice Porter of Roseburg.

Terri Horman (right) told investigators she dropped off her son Kyron, left, at a science fair at Skyline Elementary School on June 4, 2010 and he hasn't been seen since. Investigators focused on her

'Why should she get to move on with her life? Everybody has a right to know who she is.'

The judge rejected the request, saying it wouldn't be in the public interest because an investigation remains open.

Terri Horman told investigators she dropped off the seven-year-old for a science fair at Skyline Elementary School on June 4, 2010. 

There has been no trace of him since. 

There have been no arrests.

She and the boy's father, Kaine Horman, divorced, and she moved to Roseburg, her hometown.

Still looking: Kyron's disappearance prompted Oregon state's largest ever search effort. He has not been found and no one was ever arrested
