THE MATHEMATICS OF LOVE

Valentine’s Day can feel like the loneliest day of the year if you haven’t yet found that elusive creature, your true love.

The Mathematics of Love by Hannah Fry 

The cinema is showing nothing but romcoms, every restaurant is crammed with smug couples holding hands and gazing soppily into each other’s eyes and when you visit the supermarket to buy a ready meal for one and a bottle of consolatory gin, you have to fight your way through a thicket of cheap red roses.

Unless you are very young (or exceptionally arrogant), it is hard to feel certain of finding love. That special person may well be out there, but how do you begin the search? And if your heart has already been hurt a couple of times, it can feel as though you have missed your chance.

A mathematical equation might not seem the most likely answer to the conundrum of romance. But Dr Hannah Fry, a lecturer in mathematics at University College London, is convinced that ‘mathematics can offer a new way of looking at almost anything — even something as mysterious as love’.

In her new book, Hannah admits that many people would question the ability of maths to unlock the secrets of the human heart. ‘Human emotions, unlike mathematical equations, are not neatly ordered or well-behaved,’ she concedes.

But she argues that maths is the study of patterns, and ‘love — as with most of life — is full of patterns: from the number of sexual partners we have in our lifetime to how we choose to message on an internet dating website’.

To show how the maths might work, she uses the story of Peter Backus, a mathematician and long-standing singleton who once calculated that there were more intelligent alien civilisations in the galaxy than potential girlfriends for him to date.

In his paper Why I Don’t Have A Girlfriend, Backus used a formula originally devised by scientists to consider why Earth hasn’t yet been visited by aliens to work out how many women would meet his criteria for a girlfriend.

In seven stages, he calculated how many women lived near him in London, how many were in the right age range, how many were single, attractive, with university degrees, likely to find him attractive and get on well with him.

At the end of his calculations, he came up with a figure of just 26 potential partners in the entire world, so Peter’s chances of finding a date were looking pretty thin.

But when Hannah ran the calculations again, with slightly more flexible criteria, she came up with a more encouraging 832 possible partners — and it looks as though her sums were right, for she tells us that Backus got married last year.

Having increased our chances of finding a partner by keeping our criteria flexible, it is time to move on to the tricky world of online dating. Here, Hannah has bruising personal experience: ‘It didn’t seem to matter how detailed my online profile was . . . I still routinely found myself seated opposite yet another person asking if my red hair tasted like strawberries.’

You might think that the most beautiful people on any dating website would be the most successful at attracting potential partners. But it is not as simple as that.

Using a graph to plot the attractiveness of 5,000 female users of the OKCupid dating site against the numbers of messages they received, Hannah found that people whose looks strongly divided opinion received more messages than those generally rated as quite good-looking. Which is good news for Lady Gaga, if not so great for Anthea Turner.

While we’re on the fraught subject of hooking up, we may as well pause to consider what Hannah calls the ‘eligible bachelor paradox’. This is the mysterious imbalance between the quantities of beautiful, intelligent thirtysomething (and above) single women, and the peculiar shortage of equally attractive men of a similar age.

Game theory provides the explanation: when we choose our life partners, we are influenced not just by their looks and charm, but by how keen they seem on us.

Very attractive women may feel confident enough to play hard to get, while their mousier sisters put in more effort and make off with the prize.

Which leads us to the most pressing question of all: when is the ideal moment to decide that you’ve kissed enough frogs in pursuit of your handsome prince and that it may be time to cut your losses and settle down with the current frog, even if he is a bit on the green and warty side?

Something with the unromantic name of ‘optimal stopping theory’ provides the answer to this, with a formula that apparently ‘has the power to tell you exactly how many people to reject to give you the best possible chance of finding your perfect partner’.

Reduced to its simplest terms, the formula says that if you are destined to date an infinite number of partners, you have the highest probability of finding The One if you reject the first 37 per cent of people you date.

The problem with that is that none of us knows in advance how many potential partners we might meet. So a more pragmatic version suggests that you should estimate the length of your dating life, play the field for the first 37 per cent of your dating window and then start thinking about settling down.

The theory still has some obvious flaws, in particular the danger of meeting someone kind, good-looking and rich early in your dating life and turning them down in the hope of doing better. But if you’re that dim, you probably deserve to be single.

On the bright side, according to Hannah the 37 per cent strategy works equally well for all kinds of choices, including buying a house or hiring an employee.

With the help of optimisation maths to avoid disasters on the seating plan at the wedding, and some handy equations to help you live happily ever after (something called the ‘negativity threshold’ is the crucial thing, apparently), this quirky little book combines cool science with warm good sense.

And it works! At the very end of the book, Hannah writes that she ‘lives in London with her husband Phil, who — luckily — came along at exactly 38 per cent’.

I’m sure luck had nothing to do with it.
