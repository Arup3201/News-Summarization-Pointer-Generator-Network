Teenage girls who spend hours flicking through photos on Facebook are more likely to have body image problems that could lead to eating disorders

Teenage girls who spend hours flicking through photos on Facebook are more likely to have body image problems that could lead to eating disorders, doctors have warned.

It is not the overall time spent on the social network that is the problem, but the amount of time spent looking at pictures, they said.

This includes looking at other people’s albums as well as posting selfies.

The more they look at photos on Facebook, the more likely they are to think of themselves as too fat or as having the wrong body shape.

That in turn leads to body image problems which can result in anorexia and other eating disorders, said researchers from the American University, Washington.

They analysed the Facebook use of 103 adolescent girls along with their answers to a psychological questionnaire specifically designed to test their body image satisfaction.

Little connection was found between the overall amount of time spent on the social media site and how they viewed their shape and size.

But there was a correlation between spending a large proportion of that time looking photographs and body image problems.

These include 'internalising' where young girls begin to see a very thin physique, rather than an athletic one for instance, as being the ideal shape for them.

This leaves them dissatisfied with their own size and shape, even if they are healthy and fit, researchers wrote in the journal Cyberpsychology, Behaviour and Social Networking.

Researchers Evelyn Meier and James Gray reported: ‘It is not the total time spent on Facebook or the internet, but the amount of Facebook time allocated to photo activity that is associated with greater thin ideal internalisation, self-objectification, weight dissatisfaction, and drive for thinness.’

The problem is that, for many teenagers, Facebook has replaced traditional face to face conversations, said the researchers.

This means they see others in a kind of 'digitised' form when they see their photos of the site, rather than see the person, in the flesh, which may give them a different visual impression.

Journal editor Brenda Wiederhold said: ‘Given the connection between eating disorders and body image distortion and dissatisfaction, it is important to identify contributing factors in this particularly vulnerable group.’

Overall time spent on the site isn't a problem - it's the amount of time spent looking at photos

This includes posting selfies and looking at other people's albums

People who look at a lot of photos on Facebook are more likely to think of themselves as fat so they are more likely to develop an eating disorder
