A one-handed fighter is taking mixed martial arts by storm.

Currently undefeated as a professional, Nick Newell is defying the odds and finding more believers with each passing fight. He is 10-0 after winning his Saturday fight against Keon Caldwell by submission.

Newell has won all but one of his fights by either knockout or submission.

Remarkable: Nick Newell is 10-0 despite fighting with only one hand

Newell, 27, was born missing a left hand. His arm ending just below his elbow, Newell has refused to let it define him.

In the Caldwell fight, Newell forced the seasoned pro to tap out only 2:07 into the first round with a choke hold.

‘I had a bunch of ways I thought I would beat him and this was one of them,’ Newell said in a post-fight interview.

Seemingly having a great advantage over the one-handed Newell, Caldwell was put a scare into Newell before succumbing to the one-handed fighter’s deft takedowns and gritty determination. Newell dropped him to the mat on multiple occasions before applying the winning choke-hold by using his less-defined left arm as leverage while clenching it with his right hand.

Confident: Newell has won all 10 of his professional fights

‘I came out there to put on a good show,’ Newell said after the match. ‘He was a lot quicker and stronger than I thought he'd be.’

The 155-pound congenital amputee earned a berth in World Series of Fighting’s lightweight tournament. He was the lightweight champion at Xtreme Fighting Championship, which he left for WSOF earlier this year.

An all-state high school wrestler in Connecticut, Newell holds the state record with 53 wins, according to his Facebook fan page.

Not content to settle, Newell has his sights set on joining UFC, the most lucrative MMA organization.

The inspiring fighter told ESPN earlier this year that he ‘hopes UFC President Dana White sees a fighter who is hard to take down and has a solid chin, precise kicks and a loaded right hand.’

Telling ESPN that ‘the best in the world fight in the UFC, and let me tell you, it's tough with two arms and two legs,’ White didn’t yet sound convinced.

Newell's ascendance as a congenital amputee isn't unprecedented. Major League Pitcher Jim Abbot carved out a 10-year MLB career as a starting pitcher, most notably for the California Angels and New York Yankees. Abbott even pitched a no-hitter for the Yankees in 1993 and even more remarkably had two career hits.

Not perfect: Jim Abbott pitched 10 season in the Major Leagues, even throwing a no-hitter for the New York Yankees in 1993 -- even more remarkably, he has two career hits

Undeterred, Newell looks forward to his next bout, the second title shot in the two leagues he’s fought in.

‘I know what it’s like to be at the bottom,’ Newell said after the Caldwell fight. ‘Now I’m at the top and I’m not letting anyone take it away from me.’
