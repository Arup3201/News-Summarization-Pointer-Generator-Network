Muslim community leader Keysar Trad has accused the Federal Government of exaggerating the home-grown militants problem.

There are reports that Islamic radicals have Australia in their sights and that counter-terror agencies are preparing to lift the country's alert status to high.

But the president of the Islamic Friendship Association of Australia (IFAA) says the concerted 'negative campaigns' against the building of mosques is a major part of the problem which has 'radicalised some of our youth'.

'We want to be part of the solution but denying us the ability to build more prayer facilities, enabling us to reach out to those lost souls, is making it too easy for the radical minority to win,' Mr Trad said.

Keysar Trad arrives at a recent meeting with the Prime Minister and Attorney-General George Brandis to discuss the home-grown terror threat. 'I wonder whether sometimes they are just shooting in the dark, just don't know the dynamics of the situation are, or don't want a real solution'

Attorney-General George Brandis and Prime Minister Tony Abbott have announced a suite of counter-terrorism and border protection measures in the past month worth more than $600 million

'It was to their credit that we've had these meetings but the government, I wonder whether sometimes they are just shooting in the dark, just don't know the dynamics of the situation are, or don't want a real solution,' Mr Trad said.

'The level of alarm that has been raised I feel is exaggerated. This is a fear of just a handful of individuals. 

'Anyone who knows anything about the mindset of these types of people is that when they go to these places that none of them ever really have the intention of coming back.'

Among those are Mohammad Ali Baryalei, 33, who once worked as a bouncer for nightclubs in Sydney's Kings Cross party district.

Now Australian authorities have identified him as a 'commander' for the so-called militant group the Islamic State, which is causing havoc in Syria and Iraq.

Baryalei is believed to have recruited as many as 30 Australians into the service of the group Tony Abbott has labelled a 'death cult'.

Among the fighters Baryalei has allegedly 'funnelled' into Syria are notorious jihadists Mohamed Elomar and Khaled Sharrouf, both from western Sydney.

Sharrouf was responsible for a gruesome image of his seven-year-old son wielding a decapitated head in August. 

Mr Trad claims these type of recruits are lured 'on the basis they are going to some sort of utopian state, which of course it is not'.

Baryalei is also thought by Australian officials to have been behind the recruitment of Gold Coast private schoolgirl Amira Karroum and her husband Tyler Casey, who held dual Australian-US citizenship. Both were killed in January during a battle with hard-line ISIS militants.

'The reality if that the furtherest thing from the mind of these people is to come back to something that is not that utopia they are looking for,' the IFAA founder added.

Mr Trad's life as a Muslim community representative has not been short on controversy, which includes a drawn-out defamation battle with a Sydney radio station in the Supreme Court and being the right-hand man of controversial cleric and former Grand Mufti Sheik Taj Al-Din Alhilali.

However, he was invited to meet with the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General recently and came away from those talks doubting that the government really wants input from the Muslim community on possible solutions.

Mr Trad's life as a Muslim community representative has not been without controversy, including an eight-year defamation court battle and working alongside former Grand Mufti Sheik Taj Al-Din Alhilali.

He says there are scant details available of what the local community programs to eradicate home-grown terror groups look like, telling Daily Mail Australia that a draft report was handed out at the meeting and taken back.

'We were handed a lengthy numbered draft report at the meeting regarding these counter-terror plans,' Mr Trad said.

'We had barely any time to digest the details before it was taken back at the end of the same meeting. We can't tell you what those proposed community programs look like because we, the community leaders, haven't really been involved.' 

At a meeting of Muslim leaders, Keysar Trad said: 'The reality is that the perception has now been created out there that these laws are aimed at Muslims, despite what the politicians say. We had an argument with the PM and the Attorney-General about this issue.'

He has taken issue with proposed new laws where it will be an offence to travel to a country declared by agencies as a terrorist zone without 'a legitimate purpose'. He says they no longer differentiate between those who leave to do humanitarian work and others who depart for more sinister reasons.

'These laws, as we've heard, now provide for the presumption of guilt ahead of innocence,' he said.

'No matter what label you want to give it, it is reversing the onus of proof.

'There's so many unanswered questions, like what is considered humanitarian work or an allowable pilgrimage and then be told it is plausible for an Australian to join the military of a country fighting another state over disputed territory?

'If you are part of an army, we have seen what has taken place in Gaza, and innocent people are killed, then these are war crimes.

'We had an argument over this issue with the PM and the Attorney-General. The reality is that the perception has now been created out there that these laws are aimed at Muslims, despite what the politicians say.

'They should be used against all parts of the community, all religions and faiths. That's not what most Australians think, that's the truth.'

'This is a fear of just a handful of individuals' Keysar Trad has told government officials in meetings

He hopes the local programs flagged by the government include backing for more mosques.

''This is what we face, the dynamics of our community is that we can't reach every single person, the established places of worship that we have just don't have the resources to cater for everybody,' Mr Trad said.

Mr Trad says Australia's 500,000 strong Muslim population is equally horrified by the violence wrought by the so-called Islamic State 'they have hijacked an ancient Islamic symbol and it should not be in the hands of such a violent group which does not represent'.

'But every time we want to establish another centre to reach out to more and more young people we face a lot of obstacles. It's the air of suspicion we face on a regular basis.

'A lot who have gone or have been talking about it, you look at their lifestyle their movements before they went.

'All you have to do is look at them, what did they do before they went, were they upstanding citizens or were they people who had serious concerns and had difficulty adjusting to life here in Australia and contributing to society?

'They are people who found it very very difficult to get accepted and belonging to Australia.' 

There are about 500,000 people of Muslim-background in Australia, representing 2.2 per cent of the population. Mr Trad says they are equally horrified but what has transpired overseas and shattered that 'they (ISIL) have hijacked an ancient Islamic symbol and it should not be in the hands of such a violent group which does not represent'.

'The problem with some of these young people is that they have this anger and suspicion, that they have been neglected. The community has not found a way to deliver services to them' Keysar Trad says of Australian militants who have linked with terror groups overseas

He believes there is only one, albeit small, window of opportunity for the return of radicals.

'If they somehow see the light and view these groups at some point as un-Islamic.

'But that is very unlikely. Once somebody has blood on their hands, it is very hard to make them see differently.

'Once they are in there they think they are an integral member of something which has a goal and an aim.'

He says the first step is to stop them being marginalised.

'The problem with some of  these young people is that they have this anger and suspicion, that they have been neglected. The community has not found a way to deliver services to them,' he said.

'But this is a problem which is not too hard to fix.'
