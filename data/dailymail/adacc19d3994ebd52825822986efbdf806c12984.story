Two escaped murderers who were released from a Florida prison after forging a court order were just hours from fleeing the state when U.S. Marshals arrested them at a motel, it has been revealed.

A witness captured dramatic cell phone video of heavily-armed federal Marshals taking down Joseph Jenkins and Charles Walker after surrounding their motel room Saturday in Panama City, Florida.

Investigators say that the pair, who have been on the run for three weeks, arrived at the motel room separately after a friend book them room for them. They were waiting for a car to arrive from Atlanta. The driver was going to take them out of state.

The video from witness Amanda McComb 
shows one of the suspects would out of the motel room with his hands up,
then kneel and put his hands on the back of his head.

Seconds later, the second suspect exits the motel room and kneels with his hands behind his head.

Deputy Marshals can be seen storming the room to make sure no one else is left, then handcuffing Jenkins and Walker.

The arrests came just hours before the convicted killers were about to leave the state, and possibly escape justice forever, ABC News reports.

Walker and Jenkins were mistakenly 
released from a Florida prison with forged paperwork, and even showed up
to another prison facility three days later to register as ex-cons.

Jenkins, 34, walked out of Franklin
Correctional Institution in Carrabelle, Florida, on September 27 after 
submitting a forged order from a judge that reduced his life sentence to time served.

Days later, Walker, also 34, used the same paperwork to get his life sentence similarly 'reduced,' as well. He was released on October 8.

The men were so convinced that their 
scheme had worked, they showed up at another correction facility to 
register as ex-cons that had been released into the community.

Family members and friends of two convicted killers initially thought their release was legitimate and spent time with them, even planning a birthday party for one.

But in the weeks after their release, relatives learned that the men were freed because of forged documents that reduced their life sentences to 15 years.

Caught: Both convicts were arrested at the Coconut Grove Motel in Panama City on Saturday evening

Henry Pearson, who was described as 
Jenkins' father figure, said he brought the convict clothes when he 
picked him up from prison, and drove him to see his mother and 
grandmother.

Mr Pearson 
planned a birthday party at his home for Jenkins, who turned 34 on 
October 1, a few days later, but he never showed up.

At a news conference on Saturday, family members of both men pleaded with them to turn themselves in.

'We
love you. We believe in you. We just want you to surrender yourself to 
someone you trust who will bring you back here safely. We don't want any
harm to come to you,' Walker's mother, Lillie Danzy said.

Ms
Danzy said the family thought their prayers had been answered when she 
got the call saying Walker would be released October 8.

She
was so shocked and delighted that she called the prison back twice to 
make sure it was true, and was told the same information each time, an 
attorney for the family said.

Appeal: Walker's mother, Lillie Danzy, her husband Jeff, listen as Jenkins' uncle, Henry Pearson, calls for the men to turn themselves in

Manhunt: The families of the two escaped convicts made an emotional appeal to them a few hours before Jenkins and Walker were caught

Walker was taken by prison staff to a bus station so he could travel home, and the convict even attended church during his pseudo release. His mother said the family have been cooperating with authorities and made no attempts to hide him.

Just like Jenkins, Walker registered 
as a felon at the jail three days after he was released. Both men signed
paperwork, were fingerprinted and even photographed before walking out 
of the jail without raising any alarms.

By
registering, the men drew less attention to their forged release. Had 
one of the murder victim's families not contacted prosecutors, 
authorities might not have known about the mistaken releases.

Orange-Osceola State Attorney Jeff Ashton told the Orlando Sentinel he found out about Jenkins' escape after his victim's family told prosecutors that he had been released.

That led to the discovery that Walker also was out of prison.

'We're looking at the system's breakdown, I'm not standing here to point the finger at anyone at this time,' Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings said on Friday.

The Corrections Department has since changed the way it verifies early releases and state legislators promised to hold investigative hearings.

Chief
Judge Belvin Perry, who presided over the Casey Anthony trial, believes
that the two inmates had outside help in forging the documents.

Judge Perry told the Orlando Sentinel: 'I strongly believe they had some help. It is unlikely [the documents] were produced by the inmates.'

However he has few leads on who might have falsified the documents and it is unclear how they were filed. Investigations are ongoing.

Judge Belvin Perry, who presided over the Casey Anthony trial, had his signature forged on fake court documents that led to the early release of two convicted murderers

The court orders appeared legitimate, said Judy Perry,  with the county seal, letterheads and identical formatting to real papers.

Whoever created the documents had 'elementary knowledge', according to the judge.

It is not the first time a Florida convict has used a forged signature from a judge to secure his release.

When Judge Thomas McGrady heard of Walker and Jenkins' escape his 'Reaction was "Oh no, not again",' he told WTSP.

In 2009 Nydeed Nashaddai, 44, used a forged court order bearing Judge Thomas's name to escape prison, where he was serving a sentence for theft.

Walker and Jenkins were doing time for more serious crimes however. Walker was serving life for a second-degree murder committed in Orange County in April 1999.

He told investigators at the time that
he had intended to frighten 23-year-old Cedric Slater whom he said had 
been intimidating him. Walker fired three shots, one of which struck 
Slater and killed him. 

Jenkins was also serving life in prison for the first-degree murder of a father of six in Orlando in September 1998.

Jenkins and his cousin Angelo Pearson had planned a home invasion at the home of Roscoe Pugh, 28. The father of six died from gunshot wounds.
