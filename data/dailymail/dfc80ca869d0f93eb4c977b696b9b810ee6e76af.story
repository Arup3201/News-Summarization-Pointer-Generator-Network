An Arizona man shot his brother dead after learning he was giving his ex-wife drugs in exchange for sexual favors, authorities said.

Christopher Wasar, 39, shot 45-year-old Matt Wasar in the chest Saturday after a brief altercation over him sleeping with Jessica Wasar, 39, court records showed.

The divorced couple has at least two young children together, with one born as recently as 2009, according to social media posts.

Matt Wasar had apparently been hiding out at a friend’s apartment in fear of Christopher Wasar after his younger brother found out what he and Jessica Wasar had been doing, sources told AZ Central.

Brady McGonigle, the elder Wasar’s roommate, called 911 1.30 p.m. after the former spouses burst into his apartment, according to the paper.

Jessica Wasar insisted they were there to retrieve items she had stolen from her former spouse and given to her new flame, but the sequence of events that followed suggest Chris Wasar had revenge in mind, McGonigle agreed.

‘I thought I was going to die today,’ he told police.

The younger brother held McGonigle at gunpoint as Jessica Wasar ransacked the apartment, police said. They left after five minutes.

Jessica Wasar then noticed Matt Wasar in a car in the apartment building’s parking lot, which Chris Wasar quickly approached.

The two men got into an argument and Chris Wasar punched Matt Wasar, pushed him away, then shot him in the chest, police said.

Chris Wasar tried to flee the scene but was quickly arrested, a police spokesperson told AZ Family.Matt Wasar was taken to a local hospital and pronounced dead.

The younger Wasar first claimed to investigators that his brother came at him with a knife, according to police records. Witnesses, including Jessica Wasar, said the dead man was unarmed.

Chris Wasar has been charged with second-degree murder and burglary. It is not clear if his ex-wife will face charges for her role in the break-in.
