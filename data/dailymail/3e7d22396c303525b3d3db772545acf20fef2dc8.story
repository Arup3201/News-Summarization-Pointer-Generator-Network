Entering the charts of Andy Murray’s most convincing wins in his Grand Slam career, straight into the top three, goes Blaz Rola.

The defending champion was utterly ruthless in trouncing the 23-year-old Slovenian in just 84 minutes to reach the third round and put himself on track, you would expect, for the second week.

Murray’s next opponent will be Spain’s Roberto Bautista Agut, the world No 23, and it is unlikely to be as straightforward as the exhibition put on for grateful Court One patrons in this unusual lunchtime spot.

All too easy: Murray volleys a winner into the empty court with Rola out of sight and out of the point

Yet in this form Murray can be 
expected to progress, for he asserted the kind of crushing superiority 
you so regularly see in early rounds from Novak Djokovic and Rafael 
Nadal.

The world No 5 does 
not possess the threshing machine mentality of his two main rivals, 
which often sees them reach the latter part of tournaments with plenty 
in reserve.

Murray is aware 
of that and set his mind to schooling the standout player from the 
highly competitive American college circuit of last year, who will play 
much better than this with a few more outings on grass.

This
 was Murray’s easiest victory at Wimbledon, surpassing the first round 
of 2012 when he allowed Russia’s Nikolay Davydenko only six games.

Given
 that grass tends to offer more free points for the server than other 
surfaces, it is highly unusual that anyone is cleaned up as 
comprehensively as poor Rola was on Wednesday.

A
 lot of it was about energy conservation and making this obligatory 
visit to Court One — it is only right that no player gets a season 
ticket on Centre Court — impressively brief.

Murray
 had a recent reminder of how important it is not to get bogged down in 
early rounds at the French Open where, slightly leg weary, he found 
himself on the wrong end of a severe tonking from Nadal in the 
semi-finals.

‘I’m not saying I would have beaten Rafa but it cost me there, playing lots of long matches,’ he reflected.

‘Against
 Philipp Kohlschreiber (in the third round) I was up in every set and it
 eventually went to 12-10 in the fifth. So it’s important to get through
 these matches as quickly as possible.’

A
 good barometer of how straightforward a Murray match has been at 
Wimbledon is the type of questions he has to field afterwards: the more 
off-piste they are indicating just how comfortable a day it has been.

And
 so he was asked if was he pleased the Duchess of Cornwall had taken a 
diversion from the Royal Box to watch his match. Yes. What did he think 
of Luis Suarez biting Giorgio Chiellini? Unnatural behaviour. Pleased 
with Alan Stubbs’s appointment as Hibernian manager? Again, yes.

Is
 he concerned that LeBron James rejected a new contract with Miami Heat?
 It does not necessarily mean the team’s marquee player will be leaving.

Then
 there was the retelling of how he rescued a large dog from traffic 
after it has strayed on to the road near his Surrey home earlier in the 
week.

More connected to 
tennis was his view about whether another Slovenian, Aljaz Bedene, 
should be allowed to switch nationalities and play in the Davis Cup for 
Great Britain.

‘I don’t 
really mind,’ he said. ‘If he becomes a British citizen and is able to 
play then I see no reason why he shouldn’t be able to do it. I don’t 
make the rules.’

Having to 
answer diverse enquiries is an encouraging symptom for Murray, who was 
also questioned about how it is going with Amelie Mauresmo.

He reverted to his stock reply of ‘so far, so good’.

This
 certainly appears to be the case and if you talk to those within his 
camp they confirm that she has settled in very comfortably with the 
long-established group around him.

There
 were also some encouraging clues in his match, even though Rola found 
his natural timing difficult to come by on the grass when being fed so 
many types of different spins and angles by a master of the surface.

One
 good sign was that when the Slovenian created his three break points, 
one in each set, they were answered with strong first serves, two of 
them being aces.

You still 
fear that less awed players will do some damage to Murray’s second 
delivery but that was never really an issue in this match.

The
 most animated the crowd got was when a ball fell out of the Scot’s 
pocket in the second set, causing the rally to be replayed — it was that
 kind of afternoon.
