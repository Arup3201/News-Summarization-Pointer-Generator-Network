Some 1,000 top bankers at HSBC are to be given a multi-million pound shares windfall in a bid to avoid an EU cap on bonuses.

The lender asked shareholders to design a system that complies with the Brussels edict while still rewarding staff – and avoiding an exodus of valued staff to Asian and US rivals. 

It claims the shares do not qualify as a bonus because it forms part of their fixed pay package.

Scheme: Some banks have been accused of trying to avoid a bonus cap by giving staff multi-million-pound share windfalls

Unlike bonuses, fixed pay cannot be clawed back from reckless staff or those embroiled in wrongdoing.

HSBC
 has been speaking to some of its biggest shareholders to come up with a
 system which complies with the edict from Brussels while avoiding 
cutting pay for staff.

Banks
 claim the cap - which applies to staff worldwide -  will cause their 
best employees to leave for Asian and US rivals which do not have such 
restrictions.

Under fire: Campaigners have accused HSBC of 'concocting elaborate schemes' so they can continue paying seven figure sums to staff

But last night campaigners blasted lenders like HSBC and Barclays for ‘concocting elaborate schemes’ so they can continue to dish out seven figure awards to staff.

The bonus cap, imposed by Brussels 
this month, restricts bonuses to a maximum of one year’s annual salary, 
rising to double that if shareholders approve.

HSBC’s
 open show of defiance comes as the Government mounts a legal challenge 
against the cap, saying it encourages banks to raise fixed pay and 
promote risk-taking.

Anger: Bankers at Barclays have been slammed for devising a scheme to avoid a cap on bonuses

Unlike bonuses, fixed pay cannot be clawed back from reckless staff or those embroiled in wrongdoing. Staff will not be able to cash the shares in for five years.

Shareholders will be asked to vote on  the new system in May.

Investors at all the UK banks will also be asked to vote on whether to hand bonuses worth more than one year’s salary to staff.

Barclays has already introduced a system to avoid the bonus cap by introducing monthly cash payments for top staff.

Luke Hildyard, from the High Pay Centre, said there was no ‘convincing argument’ for payments to retain HSBC staff.

He said: ‘Rather than concocting elaborate schemes to dodge the bonus cap, HSBC and other banks should be engaging in an open debate on why bankers are paid so much more than everyone else and what would be fair and proportionate.’

He added: ‘We have not seen a convincing argument that these kind of payments are necessary to retain HSBC staff, nor is there much evidence that top bankers are as indispensable as they claim.’

Some 204 staff at HSBC received a pay package worth more than £1 million in 2012, with 78 of those based in the UK.

Chief executive Stuart Gulliver received £7.4 million in pay and perks for 2012, despite the bank being fined £1.2 billion in the US for laundering money for drugs gangs and terrorists.

The news comes as Britain’s biggest banks prepare to reveal over the next few weeks how much they dished out in bonuses last year as they publish their annual reports.
