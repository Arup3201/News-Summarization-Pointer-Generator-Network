Study: Smokers cost their employers an extra $5,816 annually compared to nonsmoking workers

Smokers cost their employers an extra $5,816 annually compared to nonsmoking workers, according to researchers.Â 

The costs primarily come from higher health care expenses, excess absenteeism and lost productivity due to smoke breaks, according to the study, which was published in the journal Tobacco Control.

'This research should help businesses 
make better informed decisions about their tobacco policies,' said lead researcher Micah Berman of Ohio State University.

'We constructed our calculations such that individual employers 
can plug in their own expenses to get more accurate estimates of their 
own costs.'

The extra expense that an employer will pay on average for a smoking employee could run as high as $10,125, the study found.

One
eight-minute smoke break a day could cost employers $1,641 annually, 
based on the average hourly rate plus benefits ($26.49) earned by a 
smoking employee.

But the 
researchers say it is more likely that employers lose even more money - 
up to $3,077 annually - to smoke breaks, now that most companies ban 
smoking directly outside of their offices, so employees must venture 
further from the office to puff a cigarette.

The larger number assumes that employees are taking two 15-minute smoke breaks daily.

On an annual basis per smoker:

$1,641 to $3,077: Reduced productivity due to smoke breaks

$2,056: Health care costs for self-insured employers

$517: Excess absenteeism

$462: Reduced productivity related to the effects of nicotine addiction

In addition to smoke breaks, the 
researchers say companies should also account for annual costs 
associated with excess absenteeism ($517 annually), reduced productivity
related to the effects of nicotine addiction ($462 annually) and extra 
health care costs for self-insured employers ($2,056 annually).

Berman calls the cost estimates 
conservative because, saying it even takes into account the annual 
pension savings from a smoker's early death, which amount to roughly 
$296 per year.

'Employers try to correct for the 
idea that smokers cost more by paying them somewhat less,' lead 
researcher Micah Berman of Ohio State University told NBC News. 'Even when we adjusted for that, smokers still cost more,' he said.

By comparison, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated a decade ago that productivity losses and medical costs amount to about $3,400 per smoker annually.
