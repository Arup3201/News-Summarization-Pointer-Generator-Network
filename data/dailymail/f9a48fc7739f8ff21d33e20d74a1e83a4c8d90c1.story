Lee Dickson believes patience will be key when Northampton resume their European Champions Cup campaign against Treviso in Italy on Saturday.

Saints recovered from an opening weekend loss to Racing Metro, and expect to remain on a quarter-final course by beating the Italian club home and away over the next eight days.

‘You can’t afford to lose more than one game if you want to finish as pool winners,’ scrum-half Dickson said. ‘They are a big physical team, and they are very proud, especially at home. Italian teams are always like that.

‘It will be a very tough game, so we have to front up to the challenge. It’s all about patience and playing your own way and out-working them. Hopefully, you get your rewards in the final 20 minutes of each half.’

Meanwhile, Munster will edge closer to a quarter-final place if they claim their 100th win in European competitions against Clermont Auvergne.

‘Fear drives you on in European rugby,’ said their skipper, Peter O’Mahony. ‘It’s the beautiful thing about this competition, how competitive it is and how it has turned out now. It’s more competitive than it ever was, so you have to be on your game.’

Saracens’ England lock Mouritz Botha is to join South African Super Rugby franchise The Sharks.

Saracens said they had ‘reluctantly released’ 32-year-old Botha, who will join the Durban-based Sharks from January 1.
