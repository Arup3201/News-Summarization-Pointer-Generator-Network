Lined with barbed wire, guarded by soldiers wearing riot gear and with tanks waiting nearby, this is perhaps not the welcome Kurdish refugees were hoping for as they fled across the Turkish border from Syria.

But for now this is the safest place for the thousands of men, women and children to be as hoards of ISIS militants descend on their home town of Kobani.

U.S.-led airstrikes and soldiers from the Kurdish peshmerga have managed to hold the brutal Islamic extremists back for now, but there are fears they could still take the town.

If that happens, many Kurds fear they will be massacred in the same way the Yazidis were after ISIS fighters seized Sinjar last month, forcing them to flee into the hills.

Anger: Turkey, already home to an estimated 1.5 million refugees from Syria's civil war, is pushing the United States and its allies to create a safe haven for refugees inside Syrian territory

Among the 150,000 Kurds to arrive in Turkey in the last week is Mohammed Muslim. Dressed in a battered suit, his moustache flecked
with grey, he is distraught about having to leave, but fears what would have happened to him if he had stayed.

'I don't want to be in Turkey, I want to be in my village, I
want to die in Kobani,' Muslim said, running prayer beads
through his hands as he watched Kurdish and Islamic State
fighters exchange fire in the valley below.'

He added: 'If the war goes our way, then of course we'll go home, but
it looks like it will be difficult.'

Turkey, already home to an estimated 1.5 million refugees
from Syria's civil war, is pushing the United States and its
allies to create a safe haven for refugees inside Syrian
territory. A safe haven along the border would require a no-fly
zone policed by foreign jets.

President Tayyip Erdogan, until now reluctant to commit to a
frontline military role in the U.S.-led campaign against Islamic
State, has said Turkish troops could be used to help set up such
a zone.

Meanwhile, Turkey has deployed riot police at the Mursitpinar crossing gate near the Syrian border in the southeastern town of Suruc to stop Syrian refugees entering Turkey.

Show of force: Turkey has massed troops and tanks close to the border and says it may be willing to help set up a safe zone for refugees inside Syria

Ready for action: Turkey has  been reluctant to commit troops to the conflict in Syria, but has changed its stance after 1.5million refugees flooded across the border

Assault: U.S.-led airstrikes have kept ISIS militants away from the town of Kobani, on the Turkish border, so far - but there are fears it could still fall to the radicals

U.S. air strikes have hit Islamic State targets around 140
km to the south of Kobani, also known as Ayn al-Arab, in the
militant group's heartland of Raqqa, and on Saturday also hit
sites to the east of the town.

But the heavily-armed Sunni insurgents appear gradually to
be forcing the Kurdish fighters back around Kobani, raising
fears that the town may fall. Either way, the tens of thousands
of refugees who have crossed the border in recent days may be in
Turkey for a long time, aid workers say.

'You've seen it in other places along the border. There's no
fighting anymore but people stay in Turkey,' said Umit Algan,
who runs the relief effort in the border town of Suruc for IMPR,
a Turkish aid organisation.

Desperate: Approximately 1.5million Kurds have crossed the border into Turkey, fearing execution by ISIS troops who are attacking the town of Kobani

Helpless: There are fears that Kurdish Peshmerga troops, who are partly being armed and supplied by Britain,will not be able to hold back the ISIS assault on Kobani

Lost: Men wait beside a road near the town of Suruc in Turkey after fleeing from ISIS militants in Syria who are advancing on the town of Kobani, near the border

Victims: Today the U.S. released a video of warplanes attacking ISIS militants as they fired on Kurdish refugees trying to flee across the border to safety

'I think it'll be the same here, they never know when
(Islamic State) might come back,' he said, adding that his
group's initial relief effort aimed to help refugees camping out
in mosques, schools and parks for a month only.

Crowds of mostly Syrian Kurds cheered from the Turkish
hillside as Kurdish shells kick up plumes of dust near Islamic
State positions just across the border, but the next day the
jihadists seized new ground.

The advance towards Kobani is the latest in a series of
lightning campaigns by the Islamist group which have seen them
seize swathes of territory in both Syria and Iraq.

The United Nations, which has warned that as many as 400,000
people could flee Kobani to Turkey, has said that the number of
displaced makes the influx from the besieged border town the
most serious yet of Syria's civil war.

Tensions between Turkish authorities and Turkish Kurds are high. The Kurds say Ankara is not doing enough to help their beleaguered brethren in Syria

Many of those who have fled were from poor farming
communities in the semi-arid terrain and were forced to leave
their most valuable possessions behind - particularly livestock
and vehicles.

'We have nothing here, nowhere to sleep. If they let us
collect our cars, we can sleep in them,' said one Syrian Kurdish
refugee, 60-year old Hussein Kadir Cumo.

Small crowds of Syrian Kurds gathered at crossing points
along the border to plead with Turkish officials to be allowed
to go back and collect their possessions, their vehicles
tantalizingly visible through the barbed wire fence.

A steady stream of new refugees kept arriving, many of them
herding cattle.

Labour Minister Faruk Celik, who visited the border gate,
was later quoted as saying the authorities would start to let
livestock and vehicles cross. 

Turkish military outposts occupy commanding positions on
high ground along the border, the Islamic State front lines
clearly visible below them. Armoured military vehicles patrol
the frontier, but Turkish guns have remained silent, with Ankara
reluctant to be dragged into the war.

The conflict has stirred up deep-seated resentment among
Turkey's Kurds, who inhabit large parts of the country's
southeast and accuse Ankara of backing the Islamist insurgents
in a bid to stifle a three-decade insurgency by Kurdish
militants pushing for greater rights.

Thousands of Kurds from across Turkey have descended on the
border in recent days, some living in quasi-refugee camps, in
solidarity with displaced Kurdish communities, with police
repeatedly firing tear gas to disperse protesters.

'Our family and friends are in Kobani, this border has no
meaning for us,' said Songul Morsumbul, a protest organiser. 

'But the state attacks us with gas, tells us we're terrorists.'

Turkey's government  is concerned that Western plans to arm Kurdish fighters could boost the PKK, the Kurdish militant group with which Ankara has been negotiating a fragile peace deal to end the insurgency

Cemile Gunay's son and daughter both left their home in
Turkey's southeastern city of Mardin to fight against Islamic
State four months ago, and she has heard nothing from them
since, except one brief glimpse in a TV news report.

'Sometimes I think if they just come close to the frontier I
might catch a glimpse of them,' she says, spending her night
sleeping under small trees in a dusty field overlooking the
border along with dozens of other Kurds.

'Of course it's difficult... When I hear the tank shells, it
feels like my heart will explode. (But) it's an honour for me
that they fight, an honour for the nation.'

Turkey's government categorically denies any support to
Islamic State militants, but is concerned that Western plans to
arm Kurdish fighters could boost the PKK, the Kurdish militant
group with which Ankara has been negotiating a fragile peace
deal to end the three-decade insurgency.

The main Kurdish armed group in northern Syria, the YPG, is
a sister group of the PKK, which is considered a terrorist
organisation by Ankara, the United States and European Union.

'It's very difficult for the Turkish army. Islamic State are
very dangerous,' said one soldier patrolling the border,
declining to be identified. 'But YPG are very dangerous too.'
