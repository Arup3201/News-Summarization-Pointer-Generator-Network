Alex Salmond has been accused of a 'gross error of judgment', with his praise for Vladimir Putin yesterday condemned by Ukraine's leaders, Foreign Secretary William Hague and human rights campaigners.

The First Minister is under intense pressure to apologise to the people of Ukraine after revealing that he admires Putin for restoring 'a substantial part of Russian pride'.

In Kiev, Serhiy Sobolev, head of the Fatherland party, said he hopes that Mr Salmond 'never experiences what it is like to have death squadrons walking on his land'.

Mr Hague told the Commons that people throughout the UK would be 'horrified' by the remarks, while other critics included former Lib Dem leader Sir Menzies Campbell and Mr Salmond's proindependence Green allies.

The Scottish Daily Mail has also learned that Ukraine's ambassador to the UK was briefed on the situation last night.

But in a major humiliation for the SNP leader that could harm Scotland's reputation on the world stage, pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine have gleefully seized on his comments.

Several news agencies in Moscow, including one with close ties to the Kremlin, also enthusiastically published Mr Salmond's quotes.

The First Minister was in Belgium yesterday, where his speech on EU relations was overshadowed by the international storm.

Challenged by TV reporters to explain his remarks, he said he 'disapproves' of a range of Russian policies.

The row was triggered by an interview with former Labour spin doctor Alastair Campbell for GQ magazine, which took place on March 14. Days earlier, 80,000 Russian troops had massed on Ukraine's border and the Crimea region was annexed on March 18.

In the interview, Mr Campbell asked about the Russian president, to which Mr Salmond replied: 'Well, obviously, I don't approve of a range of Russian actions, but I think Putin's more effective than the press he gets I would have thought, and you can see why he carries support in Russia.'

Pressed on whether he admires Putin, the First Minister added: 'Certain aspects. He's restored a substantial part of Russian pride and that must be a good thing.'

Foreign Secretary William Hague said people across the UK would be 'horrified by Mr Salmond's remarks

Yesterday, Mr Hague said: 'I think people throughout Scotland and indeed the whole of the UK will be horrified by these comments.

'Even as Russia was annexing by force the Crimea, to pay tribute to the restoration of pride in Russia is a gross error of judgment in international relations and very concerning in the attitude of the SNP.'

In Ukraine, Serhiy Sobolev, head of the parliamentary faction of ex-premier Yulia Tymoshenko's Fatherland party - the main force in the ruling coalition - said: 'I want to wish Alex Salmond and his beautiful country good luck, so that he never experiences what it is like to have death squadrons walking on his land and ripping open their opponents' stomachs in case of disagreements between them.

'I wish that Alex Salmond gets whatever he wants for his country and his people, and that Scotland never has any state storming its borders and killing its people, like we have it here with Putin's fascist squads.'

The country's most outspoken Ukrainian nationalist organisation Right Sector claimed Mr Salmond was guilty of 'double standards'.

'We are shocked and disturbed by the support shown by him to the imperial ambitions of Russian president Vladimir Putin,' said spokesman Artem Skoropadsky. 'Ukraine has been fighting for its independence and integrity and who if not Scottish politicians should understand our feelings and aspirations?

'His words must have been spoken without thinking and they are unacceptable.'

However, Denis Pushilin, leader of pro-Moscow self-proclaimed breakaway state the Donetsk People's Republic - where seven international observers are being held hostage - said: 'I totally support Alex Salmond's position. The deeds and the methods of the Russian president prove that he is right.

'I personally know patriotism, what it means to stand up for your land. And in many ways it's all thanks to Putin. The opinions like Alex Salmond's are needed here and they are needed in Kiev.'

In Washington DC, leading members of the House of Representatives condemned Mr Salmond's comments.

New York Republican Pete King, who was critical of the SNP's decision to release the Lockerbie bomber in 2009, said: 'I don't see how anyone who is a democratically elected leader can in any way sanction what Putin is doing. It raises serious doubts about his leadership.

'To be praising Putin is indefensible and irresponsible and he should be ashamed.' Mr King added that Mr Salmond 'seems to have a soft spot for tyrants and aggressors'.

Back home, Labour frontbench MP Jim Murphy said: 'I'm certain that the First Minister will now want to apologise to the people of Ukraine for this dreadful blunder.'

Lib Dem Sir Menzies Campbell said: 'The First Minister should avoid judgments for which he is clearly unqualified.'

Green MSP Patrick Harvie said: 'When Scotland takes responsibility for our own foreign policy, we'll need to show far better judgment than Mr Salmond has today.'

But a spokesman for the Mr Salmond said: 'The First Minister agrees with Amnesty International, which is why he made clear in the interview that he disapproves "of a range of Russian actions".'

Mr Salmond told BBC News: 'I disapprove of a range of Russian policy, including their attitude towards Ukraine and also the human rights agenda.'
