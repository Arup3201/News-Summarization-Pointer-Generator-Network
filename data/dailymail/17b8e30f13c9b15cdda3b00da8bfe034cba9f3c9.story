A young man who was possibly suffering from mental illness  is suspected of shooting and killing his parents.

Lissa and David Haynes, of San Diego, California, were rushed to the hospital shortly after 3 am on Friday when responding officers found them in their home with multiple gunshot wounds.

Five hours later, their son, Peter Haynes, was taken into custody when he was spotted trying to walk away from officers while carrying a semi-automatic handgun in his pocket.

Caught: Peter smiled as he was taken into custody

Now, Peter's sister, Kimberly Haynes, is revealing that he brother is mentally ill and that he 'suffers from paranoid schizophrenia.'

This as the young man was spotted smiling as he was taken into police custody, and just a few weeks ago took a photo of him and his sister holding a gun, posting the picture to Facebook.

His sister however sees absolutely nothing wrong with this photo.

 'It’s very difficult to get close to him and one of the ways he and I connect is by teaching each other how to bond,' Kimberly told NBC 7. 

Making the call: David, an emergency room doctor, called 911 after he was shot

It is still not clear what caused the shooting, but it is known that it was David, an emergency room doctor, who notified authorities after being shot.

Then, their entire neighborhood went on lockdown as police conducted a five hour manhunt searching for the shooter.

They eventually came across Peter, 22, who they believe may have been hiding in the bushes all along.

He was booked into San Diego Central Jail on two counts of first-degree murder and will be arraigned on December 3.
