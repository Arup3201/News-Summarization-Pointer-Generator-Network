Authorities believe a 63-year-old woman passed away more than a year before her body was found at her Makanda, Illinois home where she lived alone.

The body of Sunantha Simmons was discovered Christmas Day when relatives from Japan came to visit her. 

The relatives hadn't heard from Simmons in over a year and were devastated to learn she had died, with no one close enough to discover she passed.

News of Simmons' death rocked her populated neighborhood on Whippoorwill Lane, where it was rumored she may have moved back to her native Thailand.

No one noticed: 63-year-old Sunantha Simmons was found dead in her Makanda, Illinois home on Christmas Day by family members visiting from Japan. Authoritites believe died more than a year before her body was discovered 

Left behind: A view of the house this week shows the lawn over grown with weeds and unopened packages stacked at the front door. Many neighbors believed she had moved back to her native Thailand 

However, they also knew that Simmons was troubled, and talked about her being institutionalized several times over the years for mental illness. 

Authorities say they were called to the woman's house several times in the past for medical issues, but hadn't responded to her home in more than a year. 

Simmons' step-daughter who lives in Japan is allegedly the person who found the body in the woman's garage. The county coroner determined that Simmons died of natural causes.

On Monday, local news stations photographed Simmons house with an overgrown lawn and boxes of fish oil vitamins, baby powder and vegetable oil unopened on her front step 

Neighbor Jim Crane told The Southern Illinoisan that he sometimes mowed Simmons' lawn to keep it from sticking out in the neighborhood. 

He said it was easy to overlook the overgrown home because Simmons lived as a recluse, staying in her home with the lights out, ordering food my mail and throwing her trash in the backyard.  

Shocked: Neighbor Shannon Butler says she would have checked in on Simmons, but she wasn't close to the woman

The volunteer firefighter was on good terms with Simmons, describing her as a nice lady who became depressed after the death of her husband John in 2005. 

'That's what led to her downfall,' Crane said.  

The couple allegedly met during the Vietnam War, when John was stationed in southeast Asia. It's also been reported that Simmons taught English as a second language at a university in Thailand. 

He says she was so torn up about his death that she visited him up to three times a week at Mound City National Cemetery, a 50 mile drive away. 

And the last time he talked to her, Crane said she expressed wanting to die so that she could join her husband. 

Neighbor Diana Kington, was friends with Simmons when she first moved into the neighborhood, but says they lost touch when Simmons started dealing with mental health issues.

'Lots of people were trying to figure out what happened with her,' Kington told WSIL. 'Honestly, she had money, she was very bright, I thought she was institutionalized or she had decided to leave the area and just abandoned the house.'

Another neighbor, Shannon Butler, told KFVS she would have checked in on Simmons had the two been close.  

Simmons was buried Tuesday in a plot next to her husband at Mount City.

Father Bob Flannery, who met Simmons at Saint Francis Xavier Church, said the funeral home didn't expect a large turnout for the service, but that 11 people showed up.
