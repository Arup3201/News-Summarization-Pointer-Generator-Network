Royal Navy submariner Edward Devenney was charged with communicating information on January 28 this year which could be deemed useful to an enemy of the state

A Royal Navy petty officer who works on nuclear submarines has been accused of offering military secrets to an ‘enemy’ foreign embassy in London.

Submariner Edward Devenney, 29, appeared in court yesterday charged with a breach of the Official Secrets Act under a specific spying clause which carries a maximum of 14 years in prison.

The court heard he first contacted the ‘enemy’ embassy in November last year, offering highly sensitive information related to his work.

The secret services are believed to have set up a sting operation in January by sending officers posing as agents for the unnamed country to meet him.

Devenney is said to have offered them information on nuclear submarines, including the operation of electronic warfare systems and periscopes, which could have ‘hurt’ the navy.

Westminster Magistrates’ Court was told that Devenney, originally from Northern Ireland, was charged with offering information ‘prejudicial to the interest of the state’ and ‘directly useful to the enemy’, contrary to the Official Secrets Acts 1911.

He was remanded in custody and told his next hearing will be at the Old Bailey in June.

His barrister, Lord Carlile of Berriew, indicated that his client would plead not guilty, adding: ‘The defendant will say that the information which is the subject matter of the charge is not “secret information”, and is available to the public on reasonable investigation – and secondly he will say the information is not of interest to an enemy.’

Devenney is a prolific user of Twitter, describing himself on the social network as ‘Edward Devenney. Nearly 30. Royal Navy Submarine Service. Labour supporter. Lover of ducks and chickens. Trainee Feminist!’.

The submariner has tweeted more than 5,400 times – up to 40 a day. He has 184 followers.

In his tweets he has regularly discussed his work, mentioning his deployment on HMS Trafalgar, which he described as ‘one of Her Majesty’s finest submarines’.

In January he tweeted: ‘Bomb Iran? Am not bothered, but I’ll probably be in the Submarine that fires the missiles!’

Later that month he tweeted about his work on his submarine’s electronic warfare, or EW, system, writing: ‘Repaired a periscope and half way through repairing EW system.’

In February he wrote: ‘Did I mention that I’m on a £2billion state-of-the-art submarine and we can’t get BBC1 so I’ll miss Question Time? Oh I did? Sorry.’

Moments later he tweeted: ‘Being a clever chap I utilised one of the periscopes on my submarine and got BBC1. Not great pic but could watch it!’

And in the last month he has been tweeting about Argentina and the Falklands, writing: ‘So Royal Navy has sent a V-boat to Falklands, apparently. Can’t speak for MoD, but as a Submariner I’d imagine that’s absolute b*******.’

Devenney has also tweeted about the Russian election and attacked David Cameron.

Last month he tweeted ‘Cameron is putting his political pride before the best interests of the Service’, and, when the Prime Minister visited HMS Vigilant in Scotland, ‘Cameron visited my submarine today but I wasn’t there. Wish I was to give him a piece of my mind’.

He has also tweeted directly to MPs and political figures including Lib Dem Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander, former Labour deputy leader Lord Prescott and Labour activist and reality TV star Sally Bercow, wife of the Commons Speaker John Bercow.

Devenney has been living at the onshore naval barracks HMS Drake at Plymouth in Devon when not on manoeuvres in a nuclear submarine or staying with his girlfriend’s family in Barnstaple in the county.

He was shortly due to begin serving on HMS Vigilant, a submarine which carries Trident nuclear missiles. He has also served on HMS Trafalgar, a hunter killer submarine.

Devenney had been enjoying a promising career in the Navy, with the service sponsoring him to take time away from sea to study for a degree in electronic engineering.

He had also passed exams giving him a place on a course to become a commissioned navy officer – but budget cuts are understood to have led to that career move being scrapped.
