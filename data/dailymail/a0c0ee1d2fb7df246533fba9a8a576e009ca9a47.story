More than 100,000 homeowners across the country face an average bill of £15,000 a year thanks to Ed Miliband’s mansion tax, experts said yesterday.

The Labour leader told his party conference he would impose the levy on homes worth £2 million to free up billions for the NHS.

But the plan has already come under fire from Labour candidates to be London mayor, because the tax will disproportionately affect homeowners in the capital.

Ed Miliband delivers his keynote speech at the Labour Party conference where he announced he would impose a levy on homes worth £2million to free up billions for NHS.  But the plan has already come under fire 

One candidate dubbed Mr Miliband’s flagship proposal a ‘tax on London’, while another said it could force elderly people out of their homes. The Labour leader pledged that the threshold for paying the mansion tax will rise in line with average house prices, to ensure that more and more people are affected.

But there are fears future Chancellors would be tempted to lower the starting point – so homes worth £1.5 million or even £1 million are dragged into the levy.

Labour says the tax – a levy of 1 per cent on the additional value of homes above £2 million – will raise £1.2 billion a year, but property website Zoopla puts the figure at £1.6 billion. Some 96 per cent of this would be paid by homeowners in London and the South East.

Overall, the annual levy would hit 108,000 households across the UK – at an average cost of £15,000.

But last night Treasury sources said the new tax would raise at least £350 million less than Labour claims because of a planned discount for those who live in high-value homes without enjoying a good income. Up to one in four homeowners could be eligible for protection.

Jonathan Isaby, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘A mansion tax is a vindictive gesture that will eventually find its way down the property ladder to hit much less expensive homes.

‘As with stamp duty, future Chancellors will be tempted to lower thresholds or freeze rates while house prices go up. This kind of on-the-hoof policy is nothing more than a populist gesture, but it will be extremely damaging for families up and down country.’

There is unease among London mayoral candidates that the tax will harm Labour’s chances in the 2016 election and boost the Tory candidate who stands to succeed Boris Johnson.

The Zoopla statistics show that almost 85,500 homes worth £2 million are in the capital – 88 per cent of the total. In London, the average price of a home above £2million is £3.7 million, meaning the average annual bill would be £16,800.

By contrast, just 895 homes in Scotland and 87 in Wales will be affected.

Laurence Hall, from Zoopla, said: ‘The introduction of a mansion tax would disproportionately penalise homeowners in London and the South East who are already responsible for the vast majority of property tax take in the UK.’

The front-runner for Labour’s mayoralty candidacy, MP Tessa Jowell, attacked the mansion tax plan when it was mooted late last year. ‘I represent a constituency where it would be an issue for some people,’ she said.

‘They are people who bought homes maybe 20 or 30 years ago for a fraction of what they are worth now. They are people maybe becoming elderly who are asset-rich and income-poor. It’s fine to say we’ll impose a mansion tax, but for these people they would have to move out of their family homes.’

Diane Abbott, another possible candidate, said the proposal felt ‘like a tax on London’, while Tottenham MP David Lammy – who has already launched his campaign – said it was ‘clearly a tax on London’. The property industry came out strongly against the proposal. Rob Perrins, managing director of the Berkeley Group, said: ‘Imposing a mansion tax on London does not make sense. It will reduce house-building and limit growth. It is a tax on aspiration.’

A Labour source said it was likely that people would self-assess whether their home was worth more than £2 million, with this being checked by the HMRC. Further details of the mansion tax will be unveiled in the months ahead.

Ed Miliband will fall victim to his own mansion tax – because he lives in a house worth £2.6 million. The four-bedroom semi-detached home in North London was bought five years ago for £1.6 million. 

Along with his wife Justine Thornton, Mr Miliband bought the townhouse with a £400,000 mortgage. He contributes to the loan repayments, but his name is not on the deeds. According to property website Zoopla, it is now worth £2.6 million, meaning the couple face a mansion tax of £6,000 a year.
