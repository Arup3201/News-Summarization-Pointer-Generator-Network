The parents of a dying toddler who captured the nation’s hearts when he was the best man at their wedding have been given the devastating news that a potentially lifesaving drug has failed to save him.

Brave two-year-old cancer patient Charlie Harris-Beard started Aurora Kinase treatment earlier this month just days after he drove down the aisle at his parents’ wedding in his favourite remote controlled car.

The revolutionary drug, which is administered over 72 hours every 21 days via intravenous infusion, is intended to inhibit cancer growth by blocking the enzymes which cause cancerous cells to grow.

Devastating: Charlie was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia on Easter Sunday 2011

It was hoped the treatment would pave the way for Charlie to undergo radiotherapy treatment in the future and that it could potentially save his life.

The courageous toddler finished the revolutionary trial at Birmingham Children’s Hospital on December 14 but last Thursday his heartbroken parents revealed the treatment had not worked.

Taking to Charlie’s Facebook page ‘Help Save Baby Charlie Harris-Beard’, mum Fiona and dad Joe, both 30, said: ‘No easy way of saying this. Charlie’s trial drug hasn’t worked.

‘He will go home today to be comfortable and in the comfort of his own home.

Courage: Charlie drove the rings down the ailse

‘Charlie is very sleepy and hasn’t woken yet. I’m still praying for a miracle please, please pray with me.’

Speaking
 on Friday, Fiona, from Kidderminster, Worcestershire, added: ‘He has 
lost the use of his legs now and can only pull himself around on his 
knees.

‘But he is still fighting and we are not giving up hope just yet.

‘Maybe it’s me refusing to accept things - but while there are still options available, we will fight to the end.'

She added: ‘There is still pioneering
 treatment available in the US, which we are desperately trying fund in 
time so he can undergo radiotherapy.

‘Otherwise if they tell us he is too ill to fly then we have run out of options. It’s a matter of days or weeks now.

Little Charlie has been battling acute myeloid leukaemia since being diagnosed on Easter Sunday last year.

In October this year he underwent a ground-breaking transplant using stem-cells from an American baby’s umbilical cord.

Tragically, just weeks later doctors told his parents they could do nothing more to help him and said he had just weeks to live.

But
 the cute toddler melted hearts across the globe when he was best man 
for his proud dad who brought forward tying the knot with mum Fiona to a
 ceremony last month

Pictures of the plucky tot driving the wedding rings down the aisle in his favourite toy car made headlines around the world.

Little
 Charlie’s battle has attracted almost 25,000 followers to his Facebook 
page and hundreds of people took to the internet to give their support 
to the family.

Yesterday the page was flooded with messages of sadness praying for a miracle.

Well-wisher Helen Field wrote: ‘I’m so sorry to be reading this. He has been in my prayers every day.

'I will keep praying for a miracle for you. Keep fighting Charlie xxxxxx.’
