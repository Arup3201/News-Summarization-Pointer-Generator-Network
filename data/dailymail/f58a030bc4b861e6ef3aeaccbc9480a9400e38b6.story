A five-year-old girl who signed during her kindergarten Christmas concert in Florida so her deaf parents wouldn't miss out has melted hearts across the U.S.

Claire Koch can be seen singing as she uses finger spelling and signing to match the lyrics of popular carols such as Rudolph the Rednose Reindeer and Jingle Bells.

Proud mother Lori, who is hearing impaired, posted the cute video to YouTube after reading about claims that a sign language interpreter at the Nelson Mandela memorial was a fake.

In a tweet earlier today, Mrs Koch said: 'My five-year-old signed even better for her deaf parents in an xmas show.'

The video quickly went viral and had more than 100,000 hits as viewers watched little Claire enthusiastically signing to a series of Christmas songs.

Claire's parents, who are both deaf, decided to put the video on YouTube after watching the poor performance of the Mandela sign language interpreter.

'It became obvious he was making things up. He was repeating the same hand movements so it was obvious he was a fake,' Mrs Koch told Fox 13.

Her husband, Thomas, added: 'It was just totally deflating for deaf people, like saying deaf people are not important. This is a famous man who did so much for many people.'

During the video of their daughter's school concert, the other children were doing hand actions for the songs, but Claire stood out from the crowd as she used American Sign Language.

'I, myself, haven’t been able to stop watching the video,' Mrs Koch told Buzzfeed.

The mother-of-two, who was born profoundly deaf, wasn't taught American Sign Language until she was about 10 so her little girl is well on the way to being a top signer.
