Lionel Messi's days at Barcelona could be over, according to former Camp Nou favourite Luis Suarez. 

The Argentine superstar is rumoured to have fallen out with club president Josep Bartomeu and doesn't see eye-to-eye with head coach Luis Enrique.

That has fuelled speculation that the 27-year-old could be sold, despite having more than three years left on his contract.

And Suarez says Messi could consider 'a stratospheric offer' from elsewhere, with PSG monitoring his situation closely.

'I think Messi is still happy at Barcelona because the club has helped him a lot. They have been very supportive ever since he was a kid,' Suarez told Cadena SER.

'But he might start to have doubts if a stratospheric offer were to come in. And you have to be careful when a player starts to gets doubts. It could be that Messi's era at Barcelona is nearing an end.

'Barcelona did not perform as we have come to expect from them last season and people might start having doubts if another season like that happens.

'Things have been said that would never have been said before. It's still early, though, and you have to give all this some time.'
