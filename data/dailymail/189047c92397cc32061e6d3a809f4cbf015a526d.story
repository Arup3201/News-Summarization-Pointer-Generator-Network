Nigel Farage was targeted by a protester spraying a bottle of Coke as he made his return to Scotland.

The UKIP leader was targeted with the fizzy drink while on the campaign trail in Aberdeen.

The attack came weeks after Mr Farage was forced to take refuge in a pub after being surrounded by an angry mob.

Mr Farage was in the city to campaign with UKIP candidate Otto Inglis who is standing in a by-election to the Scottish Parliament.

He had been canvassing in the Aberdeen Donside seat and planned to finish the day with a pint int the Staging Post pub in Bucksburn.

But he was confronted by a group of as many as eight protestors, and the UKIP leader debated with them.

As Mr Farage turned to walk into the pub he was sprayed with a bottle of Coca-Cola.

The attacker walked off before being hauled away by police.

After a day on the campaign trail with around 30 UKIP activists, Mr Farage had gone to the pub for his trademark pint at around 6pm.

He went outside to speak to a small group of protesters, who had been chanting 'fascist' at UKIP members.

He spoke to them for around quarter of an hour before deciding to return to his pint.

But as the UKIP party filed into the pub, one man who had dominated the confrontation leapt forward and sprayed threw the drink.

Most of the Coke hit the back of David Coburn, chairman of UKIP London.

Mr Farage was forced to repeatedly change his plans after a proposed press conference venue and a meeting with a senior councillor was cancelled.

He was due to have tea with Aberdeen Council deputy leader Marie Boulton in the city townhouse, but it was cancelled at the last minute. UKIP  blamed the cancellation on threats of ‘violent’ protests.

Earlier, they were forced to change their press conference venue following a late cancellation by the Marriott Hotel, in Dyce, allegedly following threats by a group called the Aberdeen Anti-Fascist Alliance.

The Coke attack came just a month after Mr Farage was forced to seek refuge in a pub after being surrounded by protesters during an earlier campaign trip to Edinburgh.

Mr Farage said blamed a 'narrative' in Scotland that 'UKIP's voice shouldn't be heard here.'

He added: 'Every attempt is being made to stop us from speaking. I've never come across anything like it in all of my life anywhere in Britain, Europe or the world for that matter.

‘The idea that you can disagree with someone's point of view but you have it out and debate these things and let the public judge is what the democratic process is all about. There is something quite unpleasant going on.

‘I think frankly the police are a little bit nervous, because some of the things that happened in Edinburgh were really quite nasty.’
