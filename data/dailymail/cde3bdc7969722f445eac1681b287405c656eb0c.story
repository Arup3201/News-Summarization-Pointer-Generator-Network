An Atlanta man had a lucky escape after he was struck by lightning and blown clean out of his shoes - leaving them behind in a plume of smoke.

Sean O'Connor was working in his backyard on Saturday under clear skies when suddenly he heard a clap of thunder.

'Just as I picked up the rake, I heard a loud crashing sound,' O'Connor said. 'A few moments later I was picking myself up off the ground. I had the taste of blood in my mouth. I noticed my leg was burning a little bit.'

Home on his own, O'Connor was dazed and confused from the lightning strike and only realized what had happened exactly as he stood and caught a distinct whiff.

'My leg hairs were singed. I could smell the burnt hair,' he explained to CBS46.Â 

'I looked across the driveway and I could see my boots over there. They were no longer on my feet, and one of them was smoking.

'At that point I realized I had just been hit by lightning.'

He immediately called his wife to tell her and then took out his cellphone to record video of his smoking shoes and his bleeding tongue to prove it.

In a video he shots seconds after the strike he appears confused and somewhat unsure.

His wife told him to go to hospital immediately.

'In my mind, I'd survived a lightning strike, and I didn't think things could get any worse from there,' said O'Connor to CBS46.

Lucky he did, because the lightning strike had interrupted the electrical rhythm of his heart and caused it to beat irregularly.

Doctors kept him in overnight and he was visited by his family who were amazed at his lucky escape.

'I've had a lot of friends comment and ask me if I can now bend spoons with my mind, which I don't,' O'Connor said, smiling.

O'Connor said doctors told him that lightning doesn't strike many people, about 1 in 700,000. And very few survive.
