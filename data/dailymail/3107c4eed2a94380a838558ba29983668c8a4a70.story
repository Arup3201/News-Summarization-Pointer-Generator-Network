This, even Louis van Gaal would have to concede, was not a game for sitting on a barstool. It was a game that had you on your feet. That had you wondering if the World Cup that keeps on giving really can get any better.

The finest players on the planet will certainly do well here in Brazil to better Tim Cahill’s 21st minute strike; an equaliser that goes straight into the greatest volleys in history file alongside men like Marco van Basten, Tony Yeboah, Paolo Di Canio and Robin van Persie. It was Australia’s 10th World Cup goal and a perfect one at that.

But it was more than just the quality of the goals. It was the sheer, unexpected drama of the encounter. The courage and determination of an Australian team, the lowest ranked side in the competition, that dared to dream and dared even to lead the beaten finalists of 2010 and most recent conquerors of Spain.

They did so because the Dutch were complacent, and defensively disorganised. Having beaten Spain 5-1, they clearly thought this was going to be easy. How wrong they were.

Arjen Robben might have opened the scoring but after little more than a minute Cahill had levelled in spectacular style, and deservedly so. Australia had been the better team against their apathetic opponents, maintaining that momentum to the break.

For Van Gaal it was proving most uncomfortable. More even than he imagined when he complained that a restricted view meant he might have to stand, or perhaps bring a barstool, to see from the sunken dug-outs. It seemed he did get the television cameraman moved, having also moaned about that.

But the Australians were giving him a much bigger problem, so much so that Van Gaal abandoned the 3-5-2 formation he had employed for this tournament and switched to a back four. In fairness to Manchester United’s next manager, he had said a back four might work better against these opponents.

It proved a smart move, even if his 
side first had to overcome an Australia penalty before Robin van Persie 
struck an equaliser and Memphis Depay produced a slightly fortuitous 
winner.

After that 
thumping victory against Spain Van Gaal stuck with the same side, no 
doubt in the hope of being able to rest players in their final group 
game.

Australia made just 
two changes, bringing in Ryan McGowan and Matt McKay. But they employed 
the same determined approach they demonstrated against Chile. Even 
though they lost that game, their effort could not be faulted.

Indeed
 here they actually displayed more energy than the Dutch in the opening 
exchanges. Van Gaal’s side were a little sluggish and disjointed. 
Perhaps even a touch complacent.

But a goal for the Dutch nevertheless came, and far too easily for Australia’s liking. It was classic Robben, from the manner in which he escaped the clutches of Alex Wilkinson to the way he then accelerated away before driving a low, left-foot shot past Matthew Ryan. But it was the failure to close him down, in particular by Matthew Spiranovic, that would have disappointed Ange Postecoglou.

Of course, Australia’s coach was on 
his feet only 69 seconds later, courtesy of Cahill’s quite staggering 
finish. It was brilliant, spectacular; the fashion in which he connected
 with McGowan’s long diagonal ball just fantastic; a left-foot volley, 
his weaker foot, crashing home off the underside of the crossbar.

A
 further opportunity would fall to Robben but to Mark Bresciano an even 
better chance would come. He had the goal at his mercy but just when it 
seemed he would send Australia into a most unexpected lead, he blasted 
his effort over the bar.

If Van Gaal’s view was less restricted, he would not have been happy with what he was seeing. Even less so when Cahill caught Bruno Martins Indi with a foolishly late challenge. Particularly foolish given it earned the former Everton midfielder a yellow card that rules him out of the final group game against Spain. It also marked the end if Martins Indi’s afternoon. He left the field on a stretcher, with Depay coming on to replace him.

The half-time statistics said it all, 
though. Australia had enjoyed 51 per cent of the ball and they had 
managed five shots to Holland’s four. Van Gaal needed to make a change 
and he did, switching to that back four formation.

No
 sooner had the second half started than Van Persie had also collected a
 booking – for a naughty lash out at Matthew Spiranovic - that excludes 
him from the next game. So that was both centre-forwards in the book.

But Van Gaal’s mood would darken further still, with the sight of Mile Jedinak scoring the 54th minute penalty that put Australia ahead.

The penalty, while it clearly struck Daryl Janmatt’s hands, was harsh given the arm was down and Oliver Bozanic’s cross was struck from close-range. But Djamel Haimoudi pointed immediately to the spot and the Australia captain converted with ease.

Four minutes later and the Dutch would
 draw level, Van Persie turning brilliantly on a neat pass from Depay 
before slotting his shot beyond the reach of Ryan.

But
 Van Persie was flirting dangerously with controversy too, a clattering 
challenge on Jedinak serious enough for the Algerian referee to at least
 consider a second yellow for the Holland skipper.

In
 the end, the Dutch just proved too strong, too technical good, for the 
courageous Australians, even if McKay perhaps should have scored prior 
to Depay’s 68th minute winner; a 30-yard shot that Ryan, on reflection, 
is sure to feel he should have saved.
