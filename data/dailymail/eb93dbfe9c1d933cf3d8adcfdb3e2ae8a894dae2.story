A high school student who suffers from multiple sclerosis has turned the condition into an advantage on the track field - because she cannot feel pain in her legs.

Since Kayla Montgomery, 18, from Winston-Salem, North Carolina, was diagnosed with the condition three years ago, she has gone on to become one of the fastest high school runners in the country.

The condition blocks nerve signals from her legs to 
her brain, meaning she cannot sense pain as she maintains a fast pace - giving her a bizarre athletic advantage.

But exercise also causes her to go numb below the waist, meaning that she must continue moving or she will lose control of her body. At the finish line, her coach has to get ready to catch her.

Fighter: Kayla Montgomery, 18, is one of the fastest high school track athletes in the country despite having multiple sclerosis. The condition blocks nerve signals from her legs to her brain so she cannot feel pain

In action: Exercise makes her legs numb so Kayla must keep momentum to stop from falling over

'When I finish, it feels like there's nothing underneath me,' Montgomery, a senior at Mount Tabor High School, told the New York Times.

'I start out feeling normal and then my legs gradually go numb. I've trained myself to think about other things while I race, to get through. But when I break the motion, I can't control them and I fall.'

After she falls at the finish line, her coach scoops her up and takes her to the side of the track where her teammates ice her legs until she can feel them again.

It is a bizarre routine that has seen great success in a short time.

When she first began running, she was one of the slowest on her team. But whereas a five-kilometer race used to take her 24:29, by last November, she had completed it in 17:22.

Multiple sclerosis is a disease of the central nervous system.

MS affects the brain and the nervous system and destroys myelin sheath layers between the nerves in the brain and spinal cord which stops impulses being carried around the body.

It can cause blindness, slurred speech, muscle weakness and a loss of coordination.

There is no known cause or cure for MS, which is twice as common in women than men. Between two and five per cent of cases are discovered in children under 16.

It typically worsens during a 'flare' in symptoms - what doctors call an exacerbation. These can last anywhere from a couple days to a couple months and quicken the disease's progress in destroying the protective barrier around a person's nervous system.

It is not known what causes MS. Environmental factors, exposure to infections and viruses and genes are all thought to play a part.

And last month, the teenager won the North Carolina state title in the 3,200 meters.

She completed the route in 10 minutes 43 seconds, placing her 21st in the country.

Next week, she hopes to break 17 minutes as she competes in a five-kilometer race at the national indoor track championships in New York.

Her coach said that he was immediately struck by her determination.

'When she was diagnosed, she said to me, "Coach, I donâ€™t know how much time I have left, so I want to run fast - don't hold back",' said Patrick Cromwell.

'That's when I said, "Wow, who are you?"'

Montgomery was diagnosed with the condition when she could not feel her legs following soccer practice and track meets three years ago.

Her coach initially dismissed her numbness as normal but when it remained, he said he knew it wasn't usual fatigue and Montgomery visited a doctor, who discovered lesions on her brain and spine.

But following treatment, she returned to the track.

Support: Her coach, Patrick Cromwell, said he had been stunned by her determination after her diagnoses

She knows that it's only a matter of time before MS - which does not have a cure - puts her in wheelchair. But until then, she's not giving up.

Sometimes she has been particularly tested, such as during a state cross-country meet last year when she tripped on another runner's foot while leading and fell to the ground.

She was unable to get back to her legs and have to crawl to a nearby fence to help her get back on her feet - and she ran into 10th place.

'I make myself do it,' she said. 'I tell
 myself, "I know you're tired and you can't feel anything and it's hard 
but you're going to finish this." And then I do.'

While she claims that some universities never called her back after she told them she had MS, Lipscomb University in Tennessee offered her a scholarship and she will start there this fall.
