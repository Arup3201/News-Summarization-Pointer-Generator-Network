Metropolitan Police constable Kevin Hughes, pictured in November, has been sacked from the force for gross misconduct

A police officer who said that a black man looked like a monkey has been sacked, Scotland Yard said today.

Metropolitan Police constable Kevin Hughes, who was based at Newham, was cleared of racially-aggravated offences in November, but has now been dismissed for gross misconduct, the force said.

Hughes and fellow constable David Hair were both cleared of using threatening words or behaviour to cause alarm and distress and of racially-aggravated harassment at Westminster Magistrates’ Court in November.

Hughes, of Brentwood, Essex, admitted saying a black man looked like a monkey, while Hair was said to have told a black woman colleague he thought she was going to 'rant' about overtime and not do any because she was 'going home to cook bananas'.

The two officers were alleged to have 
used abusive language about black men while they were on patrol.

The 
court hearing was told they referred to each other at ‘Auntie’ and 
‘Uncle’ in a sing song ‘Goodness Gracious Me’ accent.

On other 
occasions Hughes said black people were like chimpanzees or Neanderthals.

In his defence Pc Hughes claimed he was merely discussing evolution.

Chief magistrate Howard Riddle said that while Pc Hughes’s language was 'unacceptable and offensive', it did not amount to a criminal offence.

And he said that while the insulting nature of Hair’s comment seemed obvious to many, he did not think it was to him.

Hair was said to have been 'mortified' when Hughes suggested his comment could be taken as being racist.

Hughes was dismissed for gross misconduct in relation to 
authority, respect and courtesy and discreditable conduct after a hearing which ended yesterday.

Hair 
was given a final written warning.

In a statement today, Scotland Yard said the officers’ behaviour had been brought to the attention of senior management in March last year.

The matter was referred to the police watchdog the Independent Police Complaints Commission, which conducted an independent investigation, leading to the officers being charged.

Commander Allan Gibson, from the Directorate of Professional Standards, said: 'As soon as the actions of these officers were brought to the attention of the Directorate of Professional Standards the matter was voluntarily referred to the IPCC.

'The Commissioner has made it quite clear that racism is not acceptable within the Met, this is a view supported by the majority of officers and staff, which has been demonstrated by those who were prepared to challenge PC Hughes.

'The public have an absolute right to expect that officers serving with the MPS treat them and their colleagues with respect and courtesy and that they do not hold discriminatory opinions.

'Pc Hughes has now been dismissed from the Metropolitan Police Service.'

The force said that although the case against Hair was found proven, the panel has taken into account the opinion of a witness that he did not intend to cause offence, and issued him with a final written warning.

IPCC Commissioner Mike Franklin said: 'Pcs Hughes and Hair used offensive language and arguably many people will find their comments to be insulting and unacceptable.

'This situation is aggravated further by the fact the offensive remarks were made within a group of officers which suggests Hughes and Hair thought their comments were appropriate work place banter.

'Fortunately, their colleagues were not prepared to let the remarks go unchallenged and they had the courage to report the officers’ comments as well as providing evidence at the criminal trial.

'To stand-up and report your peers in this way should not be underestimated and we acknowledge and thank those officers who had the fortitude to challenge the offensive remarks.

'It is vital the Metropolitan Police Service takes seriously reports of officers using racially offensive language. It can indicate a potential wider problem and can undermine the efforts being made to deliver the professional service the public deserves.'
