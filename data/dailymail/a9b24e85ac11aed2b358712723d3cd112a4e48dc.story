She has seen her popularity soar after posting dozens of racy selfies online - and now Labour councillor Karen Danczuk shows she has even more reason to smile.

The 31-year-old has had her teeth whitened - giving her a megawatt smile that any Hollywood star would be proud to show off.

And the mother-of-two, who is married to 48-year-old Labour MP Simon Danczuk, was quick to share the good news - posting before and after snaps on Twitter while still in the dentist's office.

Brighter and whiter: Labour councillor Karen Danczuk pictured these before and after teeth whitening photographs online earlier today with the caption, 'so happy with my white teeth! 20 mins and pain free'

Making her smile: In another photo, Mrs Danczuk posed with Dr Favero who carried out the dental work

The photographs come just days after Mrs Danczuk posted videos of her doing the splits on the floor of a bar after enjoying three bottles of Prosecco on a girls' night out.

The Rochdale councillor became an internet sensation after she posted dozens of pictures online last year, mostly of her cleavage.

Mrs Danczuk 'selfies' have attracted national attention and she has gained more than 34,000 followers since uploading the steady stream of images. 

Some have praised her for making politics 'sexy' while others have criticised her for cheapening it. 

In the photos posted online today, Mrs Danczuk shares photos taken before and after her teeth whitening that show her smile is now brighter and whiter.

The caption for the photo reads: 'So happy with my white teeth! 20mins and pain free! Thanks Dr Favero. KD #white'

In a second image, Mrs Danczuk poses with Dr Favero, from the Favero Dental Clinic in London, and shares a link to his website. 

Girls' night out: A short clip of Mrs Danczuk doing the splits on the floor of a bar, above, was posted online. In it, her friend, Nicollette North, is heard saying that the Labour councillor 'thinks she can do the splits drunk'

It comes days after the Labour councillor was filmed pulling the splits in an impromptu gymnastics sessions.

In one of the clips, uploaded to video sharing website Vine last week, Mrs Danczuk is seen holding the splits as her friend, Nicollette North, records the action on her mobile phone.

Mother-of-two Ms North tells the camera that 'KD' - Mrs Danczuk's initials - 'reckons she can do the splits drunk'.

The camera then shows Mrs Danczuk on the floor of the bar, believed to be in Rochdale, Greater Manchester, before she topples over as she starts to laugh.

In another clip, the two women pout at the camera and explain they are deciding 'who does the best pose'. 

The videos also appeared on Mrs Danczuk's Twitter, where they were shared with more than 37,000 followers. 

She uploaded a photograph of Ms North in front of three bottles of Prosecco, with the caption: '@NicolletteNorth is 3 bottles in!!!'. 

The next day, Cllr Danczuk added: 'Me & @NicolletteNorth have sore heads but it's worth it. @antanddec look out, been told we're a more fun duo lol. KD'. 

The photos and videos have since been removed from Mrs Danczuk social media profiles. 

Internet sensation: The 31-year-old has posted dozens of revealing images, like the ones above, online. She revealed last month that she would sell a number of signed photographs on eBay

The mother-of-two, who is married to 48-year-old Labour MP Simon Danczuk (pictured together), shared the short video clips of her impromptu gymnastics on social media website Vine

Last month, Mrs Danczuk was seen working out with a personal trainer at a park in Greater Manchester after being labelled fat by Twitter trolls.  

She was seen completing a challenging total-body circuit  - which included push-ups, boxing and lunges.

Mrs Danczuk also revealed that she has decided to sell a number of signed and scented pictures of herself posing in a bikini on eBay.

She said she had decided to bow to public demand and sell the pictures of herself for £10, insisting that it was good business sense and a way of interacting with people.

Mrs Danczuk said that she is already having to order more copies after she sold 400 in less than 24 hours and attracted more than 4,000 views to the listing.
