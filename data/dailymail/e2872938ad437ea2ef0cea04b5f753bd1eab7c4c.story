It's time to put away your winter wardrobe as spring arrives early this weekend, with the warm weather expected to last for at least the next two weeks.

Forecasters are predicting mild weather for the next week, with temperatures reaching as high as 18C (64F) in some areas on Saturday and Sunday.

Most of the country will experience cloudy but warm weather, around 13C (55F) to 15C (59F), over the weekend, although parts of the north east will see sunshine breaking through.

Met Office forecaster Chris Bulmer said: ‘Certainly through the next couple of weeks it will be fair and settled, and that’s not going to change.

‘It will be rather cloudy but with some brighter days and it will feel mild.’

But while spring is arriving early, it will not come with the usual showers to bring an end to drought in the east of England.

Mr Bulmer said: ‘There could be spots of rain in the west but there will not even be showers, it is predominantly dry, certainly in the east over the next week.’

Some areas have already seen conditions so dry that gorse fires have started - a problem normally seen in summer.

Twenty-seven firefighters were called to Mulfra Moor, near Penzance, Cornwall, when planned burning got out of control yesterday.

The fire swept across 100 metres of moorland.
