First Lady Michelle Obama has been quick to step in and dispel her husband's joke the White House pastry chef's pies are so good he must put crack in them.

The well-timed rebuff came during the LGBT Pride Month reception at the White House yesterday.

The two were speaking on stage when President Barack Obama decided to give a shout-out to the White House's long time executive pastry chef Bill Yosses.

Obama said Yosses' pies were so good he was nicknamed 'The Crustmaster'.

'We call Bill "The Crustmaster" because his pies, I don't know what he does - whether he puts crack in them.'

Laughter broke out and Obama paused slightly before the First Lady, standing beside him, clarified: 'No he doesn't, there's no crack in our pies.'

Obama recovered: 'I'm just saying when we first came to the White House, I don't know if some of you remember this, the first year, my cholesterol shot up. I thought, it's the pie!

'So we had to establish like a really firm rule - no pie during the week.'

He then finished his anecdote saying Yosses was leaving after seven years at the White House and he would be sorely missed.
