To the casual eye, the two brides pictured in this photograph appear to be tying the knot as part of a modern same-sex marriage.

In fact, they are a heterosexual couple from Russia - where gay and lesbian weddings are strictly forbidden.

But that did not stop the groom, Dmitry Kozhukhov, 23, dressing as a woman for the ceremony - which took place in Moscow. 

Dmitry, who prefers to be called Alina Davis, describes himself as 'androgyne', someone who is unable fit neatly into either gender role. 

And he claims to feel more comfortable as a woman, despite still being attracted to females.

His bride's real identity is not known, though her first name is Alisa, 19, and she is better known in Moscow by her nickname, Alison Brooks. 

The couple married despite official disapproval and outrage from a registry office horrified at the prospect of both bride and groom turning up in dresses. 

Alina said: 'In May, we filled in the application in the registry office, and our appearance did not cause any questions at all, which surprised us.'

'But just a couple of weeks before the wedding they started to call us. When they could not reach us, they called my mother.'

The registry office was concerned that both would arrive in white bridal dresses, as, indeed, they did.

Alina added: 'The head of the registry office asked her to instruct us that we should not appear both in dresses, because in Russia marriage is between a man and a woman, and no other way. 

'She threatened that she would not allow us to come in such clothes.

'When I called her, she threatened me with an administrative punishment, saying something about the insult to the feelings of believers, and so on - although we did not marry in church.'

Eventually the registry office 'surrendered' since, in fact, there are no rules on couples marrying when both are wearing white bridal dresses.

Alina claims that other registry offices were ready to welcome them 'with open arms' because they liked the idea of the publicity.

Alisa said that she took the first step in the relationship and knew her partner Alina (above) was androgyne

He added: 'But we arrived at the appointed place at the appointed hour.

'The head of the office hurried into the room where we had to sign documents. Next, she told us insulting things that we shame the concept of family and we need to be treated.

'Alisa rightly explained to this woman that she looked no better than us.

'Finally, they let in the guests, and a film crew, and they declared us husband and wife, and we exchanged rings.

'All the staff of the registry office, the couples waiting to marry, and people on the street gave us amused glances.'

Dmitry, or Alina, believes that their wedding has sent an important message to people in Russia, where there is widespread official and public disapproval of the western trend of gay and lesbian unions

He now believes that their wedding has sent an important message to people in Russia, where there is widespread official and public disapproval of the western trend of gay and lesbian unions, and where there can be hostility to non-conventional couples.

He added: 'I believe that we have created an important precedent for such a wedding in Russia, for we are not alone in having such problems.

'I have written to couples who are planning similar marriages and are afraid of failures with registration. Be aware - you can not be refused.'

Alisa insists the couple are deeply in love and want to have 'not one child but at least two'.

She said that she took the first step in the relationship and knew her partner was androgyne. 

She said: 'I came up to her and said she is very beautiful.'

Asked how she would explain to her children that their parents were both 'female', she replied: 'Why do we need to explain? It's how it is.'

Previously, Dmitry - or Alina - has explained: 'I'm a guy with a normal orientation and, accordingly, I like women's beauty. And it should be clear my desire, to some extent, is to conform to my ideal.

'After all, girls are the fairer sex. They are beautiful. So if a guy looks like a girl - it's wonderful.

'This means that at least he is a cute guy. My idea is that a man should be just as sweet and beautiful as a woman. After all, it's terrible when beautiful, slim, gentle girl is with a rough bearded man.

'I am for the beauty for all of us. Girls nowadays are often more beautiful than men, although initially boys as well as girls have an attractive appearance, but guys do not pay attention to their beauty.

'It's sad. Girls, for example, learn something from men, develop activities that had previously been a purely male and they are clever.

'Guys can also learn a few things from girls, such as beauty and grooming, empathy, emotional warmth.

'And it has nothing to do with being homosexual. Ideally, the person will be combined with both male and female features. And this is the highest level of personal development.'
