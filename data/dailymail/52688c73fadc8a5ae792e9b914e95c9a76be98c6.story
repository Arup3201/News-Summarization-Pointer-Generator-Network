A witness to a double murder alleged to have been carried out by Aaron Hernandez claims he saw the former NFL star pull the trigger.

The 26-year-old man was in a car with Danny Abreu and Safiro Furtado when they were shot dead in an apparently random attack while on their way home from a night out.

Yesterday he alleged that it was Hernandez who pulled the trigger, saying he recognised the former New England Patriots player's face in the media when Hernandez was charged with a separate killing.

Claims: Aaron Hernandez opened fire on two men as they left a nightclub in July last year, a witness says

Witness: This man, who does not want to be identified, blames Hernandez for his friends' murders

The 23-year-old star last month pleaded not guilty to the murder of Odin Lloyd, a semi-professional football player found dead less than a mile from his home in North Attleborough, Massachusetts.

Hernandez is also being investigated by a grand jury over the deaths of Abreu and Furtado in July 2012, soon after they left a nightclub in Boston.

Now a friend of the two victims, who has refused to be named, has told Fox25 that he saw the ex-Patriots player shoot the two men while shouting, 'What up negroes?'

He said that the three friends, all immigrants from Cape Verde off the coast of Africa, had been partying at Cure nightclub in Boston's Theater District, and had not been in any fights.

They left the club at 2am, he said, and 
drove home - but when they were stopped at a red light, an SUV pulled up
next to them and someone inside started shooting.

'They were shooting everywhere inside the car, front to back,' he said. 'They just came to kill. That's it.'

He
had no idea who had committed the brutal killings - but when Hernandez 
was arrested over Lloyd's death in June this year, the witness thought 
he recognised him as the gunman.

'When
I see his face, I just recognise his face,' he told Fox25. 'Compare his
face that night to his face now. It's that face that I remember.'

The
man now says he is desperate to discover the motive behind the murder, 
and complained that Hernandez has not yet been charged over his friends'
death.

'I don't understand why it takes so long,' he said. 'Every street has cameras around there.'

Sacked: Hernandez had his contract cancelled by the New England Patriots after he was arrested

Last month it emerged that Hernandez was caught on surveillance camera at the same club as Abreu and Furtado on the night of their death.

Boston police commissioner Ed Davis told Fox25 that the case was still under investigation and expressed optimism that it would reach a conclusion soon.

Officials believe that Hernandez may have killed Lloyd to stop him speaking out about last year's murders, according to reports.

His Patriots contract was cancelled as soon as he was arrested, and the team offered to swap all replica jerseys bearing his name which were handed in by fans.

Hernandez is currently in jail awaiting trial after pleading not guilty to murder on September 6.
