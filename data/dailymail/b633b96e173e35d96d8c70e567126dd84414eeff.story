The outspoken fiance of  Bristol Palin can be seen playing with a newborn baby in a Instagram photo as a gun sits next to them on a side table.

Former Marine Dakota Meyer is holding the baby, identified as Rowan, with his gun by his side.

'Just love the fact that there is a pistol laying on the little table behind you,' wrote one person on the post.

'That's just how we roll haha,' joked Meyer.

Meyer became engaged to Bristol Palin (above) last Friday

Most of Meyer's social media pages seem to involve photos of him with guns, including another photo of him with a young boy as both hold weapons and another of a sign he was gifted by friends that reads 'I Don't Call 911' with two pistols on either side.

It is legal to openly carry a handgun anywhere in the state of Kentucky, where Meyer is from, even without a permit or license, save places where it is prohibited by federal law.

Furthermore, no state permit is required to purchase a rifle, shotgun, or handgun in that state.

The same is true of Alaska, where Palin lives with her son Tripp.

Meyer became one of the youngest living Medal of Honor recipients in American history for his actions in Afghanistan when he was just 21-years-old.

During an attack on September 8, 2009 in the Kunar Province, he evacuated 12 people and provided cover for 24 while they were under enemy fire from insurgents.

He received his medal in a ceremony two years later from President Barack Obama, requesting that those who lost their lives and were critically injured during the attack two years earlier also be remembered.

'Wonder if any ISIS members want to drop by and join my book club': Meyer taunted ISIS on social media last year, an action that was applauded by many in the public and armed forces

Last December, Meyer ignored requests from the FBI that individuals not taunt ISIS on social media for fear of an attack on the homeland, posting a photo of himself smoking a pipe and  reading a Marine handbook, writing; 'Wonder if any ISIS members want to drop by and join my book club.'

Many members of the armed forces and public applauded his actions, and his labeling of members of the group as 'cowards.'

And now, Meyer is set to become a member of the Palin family after popping the question to girlfriend Bristol exactly one week ago at a Rascal Flatts concert in Las Vegas.

Meyer and Palin have been dating for a year after meeting on the set of the Sarah Palin reality show Sarah Palin's Amazing America.

In Kentucky, where Meyer is from, no permit is needed to buy a handgun and the weapons can be carried anywhere as long as they aren't concealed
