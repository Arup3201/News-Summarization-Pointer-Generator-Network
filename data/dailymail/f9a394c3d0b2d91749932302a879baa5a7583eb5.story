Ten British holidaymakers were among a group of cruise ship passengers robbed at gunpoint during a stopover on the Caribbean island of St Lucia.

Three masked armed men held the terrified tourists – forcing them to handover cash and jewellery.

Many were left in tears from their ordeal and were visibly shaken when the group of 55 and two staff returned to their cruise the Celebrity Eclipse.

Detectives with the St Lucia police boarded the vessel to take statements from the passengers involved and two men have since been arrested in connection with the robbery.

A third person was being sought and sources said some of the jewellery stolen during the robbery had been recovered.

One passenger posted details of the robbery on the internet forum Cruise Critic.

She claimed that a woman had broken her leg during the hold-up.

Using the name Arizona Cruz Chic, she wrote: ‘One of the ships tour was robbed at gunpoint by three masked gunmen.

'We’re not on the tour but friends were. They said one woman fell and broke her leg, no one else was injured, all their money and jewellery were taken.’

The victims, who were in a convoy of mini-buses, were held up at the Botanical Gardens in Soufriere in the north of the island during a tour excursion.

The robbery took place less than a mile from where St Lucia police had mounted a huge security operation to protect Hollywood star Matt Damon and a star studded guest list at an exclusive beach resort.

The actor and his wife Luciana were renewing their marriage vows at the Sugar Beach resort where they had booked all 78 rooms at a cost of close to £750,000.

Guests at the ceremony included former President Bill Clinton’s daughter Chelsea, actors Robert De Niro and Ben Affleck and his wife Jennifer Garner.

Many locals on the island had criticised the police operation that was using the time and resources of so many officers, and was put into force to stop photographers from taking pictures of the wedding ceremony.

Damon and his wife renewed their vows on Saturday but had been at the resort all week.

St Lucia’s tourism minister Lorne Theophilus described the robbery as ‘unfortunate and a horrible scenario’.

He said the country’s prime minister had been asked to be kept informed of the situation.

Matthew
Beaubrun, Chairman of the St Lucia Tourist Board said: ‘This is a rare 
incident. This is such an important industry for us that we need to 
respond.

‘We have taken it very seriously at 
the highest level and I know the minister’s been in touch with the prime
minister, so we are not taking this thing lightly.’

The
guests were on two shore excursions, one called ‘Breathtaking Soufrière
and Warm Mineral Baths’ and the other ‘Land and Sea to the Pitons’, 
both of which were travelling on the same bus.

Last year more than 400,000 tourist visited St Lucia, with more than a quarter of those from cruise ships.

A statement from Celebrity Cruises said: ‘No one was injured in the robbery and the guests returned to the ship unharmed.

‘We
are thankful that none of our guests were injured in this unfortunate 
event, and will continue to provide them any support they may need.

‘A
vacation is supposed to be filled with fun, rejuvenation and 
relaxation. An act of crime should not be part of any vacation, and we 
regret our guests had to experience those events.’

The
Celebrity Eclipse had docked in Castries harbour on Friday for a 12 
hour stay. The 121,000 ton ship, which has 17 decks and can cater for 
2,800 passengers, was on a 14 day Caribbean tour. Prices cost around 
£3,000.

The vessel had left
Fort Lauderdale, Florida, on April 6 and its ports of calls include 
Barbados, Grenada and Aruba before returning to Florida on Saturday.

Around
70,000 Britons visit St Lucia each year. The Foreign Office warns of 
‘petty crime, including thefts’, adding that ‘there have also been some 
incidents of violent crime including assaults and murder’.

This incident is the latest involving British tourists visiting the Caribbean this year.Last month two British tourists were shot and injured in Barbados.

Ann Prior, 59, and her 72-year-old husband Phillip were gunned down during a botched street robbery in the capital Bridgetown.

The
couple, from Woodbridge, Suffolk, were on a stopover on a three month 
P&O round-the-world-cruise when they were attacked.

And
in January a leading British professor and his wife were seriously 
injured when they arrived at their holiday villa in Barbados.

Dr James Bridges and his wife Olga suffered multiple stab wounds as they fought with their attacker.
