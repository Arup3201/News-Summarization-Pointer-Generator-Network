He always told G-G-G-G-Granville the corner shop would be his one day.

And when – after almost 30 years – Open All Hours returns to our screens, viewers will see that stammering Albert Arkwright was true to his word.

In plans for a Christmas special revealed yesterday, Sir David Jason will once again play Granville.

This time, however, the one-time hapless grocery assistant is in charge.

The show will also feature Lynda Baron, 74, returning as unlikely sex symbol nurse Gladys Emmanuel.

In the new episode, Arkwright – originally played by Ronnie Barker – has died and passed the shop on to his nephew in his will.

A show source said: ‘The other characters will mention Arkwright, and his picture will be up on the wall of the shop.’

In the original series, Granville was often referred to as ‘young lad’, even though Sir David was over 30 when he played the role.

Filmed in Doncaster, Open All Hours ran for 26 episodes between 1976 and 1985.

It had 17million viewers at its peak and in 2004 was voted eighth best British sitcom in a nationwide poll.

Much of the plot was taken up with Arkwright’s clumsy attempts to woo Nurse Gladys, including several unwanted attempts to climb up to her bedroom window with a ladder.

The devious shop owner was expert at persuading customers to buy his products but was miserly with his own money. 

Every episode ended with Arkwright shutting up shop for the night and reflecting on the day. The one-off episode has been written by Roy Clarke, who penned the original series. 

Sir David, 73, said yesterday: ‘I am sure there is an audience out there who would like to see what Granville has been getting up to in the corner shop. It will be a great family show for Christmas and a fitting tribute to the legacy of Arkwright.’

Mr Clarke – who is also known for his success with Last of the Summer Wine and Keeping Up Appearances – added: ‘This has been fun – a great opportunity to work with David Jason again and to suggest how things at that corner shop might look today.’

Mark Freeland, the BBC’s controller of UK comedy production, said: ‘Having the chance to see Arkwright’s beloved shop again, now run by Granville, I hope will bring broad grins to lots and lots of faces at Christmas.’

In 2006, Arkwright’s original shop – a hairdressing salon which was converted for filming – was saved from demolition after a campaign group fought off council proposals to bulldoze it as part of wider regeneration plans.

Two years later, it was put up for auction but failed to meet its reserve price. 

The BBC said it would start filming the new episode next month but had not yet decided whether it would be shot in the original location.
