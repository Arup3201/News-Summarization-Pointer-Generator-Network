Former Cardiff manager Malky Mackay has dropped his legal claim against the club after reaching a settlement on his sacking.

Mackay was dismissed in December after a difference of opinion with owner Vincent Tan about the direction of the club.

Sportsmail understands Mackay hasn't received any compensation and paid own legal fees, in addition to issuing apology.

Tan has since criticised Mackay’s efforts in preparing the side for the Premier League, but the Scot issued a conciliatory statement through lawyers in which he apologised 'without reservation' to the Malaysian businessman.

And you're outta here! Vincent Tan wielded the axe and deemed Cardiff deserved better from their boss

Mackay’s statement, released through Slater & Gordon Lawyers, reads: 'Today I have reached a settlement agreement dropping all claims I have made against Cardiff City Football Club. I did not want to be in litigation and believe that it is in the best interests of all parties to have a clean break and move on.'

Mackay is understood to be one of the names being considered by Norwich, West Ham and West Bromwich Albion should they change managers soon.

The statement continued: 'I have enjoyed my time at Cardiff City and I am most grateful to the board of Cardiff City and Vincent Tan for giving me the opportunity. The club's owner Mr Vincent Tan invested heavily in the club and supported our decisions in our push for promotion to the Premier League. Without him this would not have been possible.

'My thanks to all those at the club and the fans who have supported me during my time in Wales. If I have caused any offence to anyone during this time, especially to Vincent Tan, then I apologise without reservation.

'I wish everyone associated with Cardiff City FC all the best for the future and thank them for their support.

'I will not be commenting further on this matter.'

Former head of recruitment Iain Moody has also reached an agreement with the club and also said he wished to make a 'clean break'.

In a statement, Moody said: 'I have today reached a final settlement agreement with Cardiff City Football Club and am very pleased that all parties will now be able to make a clean break and move on.

'Wherever mistakes were made during my time at the club, I wish to apologise for any part that I played in them, and for any offence I might have caused, particularly to Tan Sri Vincent Tan and all City fans.

'My two and a half years at the club were amongst the most enjoyable and stimulating of my career and I would like to take this opportunity to thank Mr Tan and the club’s board for the support they showed me during that time.

'There is no doubt that Mr Tan’s significant investment in the club was decisive in our success of reaching the Premier League so my personal thanks are particularly directed to him.

'During our time living in Wales, the warmth and appreciation that my family and I received was truly special so I would also thank all City fans for making our memories of the place so fond.

'I wish you all the best for the future. I will be making no further comment.'
