Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy and his wife Carla Bruni are taking legal action over a secret recording where the model refers to her husband as a 'kept man'.

The multi-millionaire heiress, who is notorious for her high living, is also heard complaining about having to 'keep' her much poorer husband who was ousted as president in May 2012 by Socialist candidate François Hollande.

In the recording, made during the 2012 election campaign in 2011 by a senior aide to Mr Sarkozy, Ms Bruni-Sarkozy said she looked forward to making money out of selling 'wrinkle cream' like US stars Julia Roberts and Sharon Stone.

Revelations that Patrick Buisson, part of Sarkozy's inner circle, recorded hours of talks with the conservative leader and his entourage have caused uproar in the opposition UMP party weeks before local elections.

Mr Buisson can be heard in the tapes, 
leaked by the Canard Enchaine investigative magazine, referring to Mr 
Sarkozy as 'the dwarf”.

Sarkozy is expected by many to contest the 2017 presidential election after his defeat by Francois Hollande two years ago.

'Mr Nicolas Sarkozy and Mrs Carla Bruni-Sarkozy cannot accept that remarks made in private were recorded and published without their consent,' lawyers Thierry Herzog and Richard Malka said in a statement.

'(They) have decided to prosecute, through an emergency proceeding soon to be filed with the Paris Grand Instance Court, the recording and publication of their conversations,' they said.

'Protecting the secrecy of private conversations is... one of the founding principles of a democratic society.'

Since leaving office in 2012 Mr Sarkozy has faced a range of corruption inquiries, all related to racking in millions of euros in cash illegally

Excerpts of the tapes were published this week in satirical weekly Le Canard Enchaine and right-wing news site Atlantico.fr.

Ms Bruni-Sarkozy, who gave up most of her commercial activities when she became Mr Sarkozy's third wife, said: 'I had fabulous contracts, and then nothing at all.

'Afterwards, I’m going to sign new contracts. I am not going to wait terribly long. If I can manage a cool little contract.'

Ms Bruni-Sarkozy, whose heyday was as a 
model in the 1990s, adds: 'You agree, they’re not going to sell 
anti-wrinkle cream to a girl of 22, right? Julia Roberts, 44, Sharon 
Stone, 52, Julianne Moore 53.

'All those are fabulous contracts, no? I 
can’t do it for the moment, because it’s not done.'

Mr Sarkozy then interrupts the jovial conversation, saying:  'I tell you, my future is to run the cash register.'

The embarrassing secret recordings highlight
 the greed of a couple who were notorious for their 'bling bling' 
lifestyle at the Elysee Palace.

Buisson's lawyer, Gilles-William Goldnadel, said the recordings were authentic.

He said his client had made them for historical research purposes and had not intended that they be made public.

Breach of privacy in France carries a penalty of up to one year in prison and 45,000 euros in fines.

In the published excerpts Sarkozy is heard discussing his electoral strategy and a 2011 cabinet reshuffle, while Bruni is recorded joking about how she had to put her modelling career on ice while she was France's first lady.

'I thought I was marrying a guy with a salary ... I had big contracts and now nothing,' she is heard saying, adding that if Sarkozy went on to lose the election she at least could re-activate her career and start selling anti-wrinkle cream.

French media have said dozens of hours of further material could emerge from recordings that date back to 2011.

Goldnadel said the recordings, which Buisson made using a device in his pocket and later uploaded to his personal computer, had been stolen from Buisson and that he would file a complaint for theft against 'persons unknown'.

'There will be an investigation to determine exactly how these recordings were taken,' Goldnadel told BFM TV. He added that his client thought he knew who had stolen them, but did not give names.

Since leaving office Mr Sarkozy has 
faced a range of corruption enquiries, all related to racking in 
millions of euros in cash illegally.

There are now calls for a parliamentary inquiry into the secret recordings.
