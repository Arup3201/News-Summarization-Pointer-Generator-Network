England's clash with Slovenia hosted the biggest Wembley crowd since Roy Hodgson's World Cup nightmare but Pointless Celebrities had a bigger peak television audience than the Euro 2016 qualifier.

ITV peaked during the broadcast at 6.3 million, while the BBC quiz show, which was on at the same time, peaked at 7.26 million just before Strictly Come Dancing.

The England match averaged more viewers when the programmes went head-to-head, 5.6 million with a 27 per cent share of audience, while Pointless Celebrities averaged 5 million viewers with a 24 per cent share.

Viewing figures for Pointless Celebrities peaked higher than they did for England's clash with Slovenia

More than 6.3million people tuned in to watch England, but the BBC quiz show peaked at 7.26m

Former sprinter and hurdler Kriss Akabusi was one of the Pointless Celebrities taking part in the show

That means that over the 90 minutes of the match, more people watched Slovenia's demise than Kriss Akabusi's on the quiz show.

And the Wembley attendance figures do at least suggest fans' faith in England is returning after a rocky post-World Cup period.

More than 82,000 fans were inside Wembley (90,000 capacity) to watch the Three Lions come from behind in their Group E clash. A penalty from Wayne Rooney and a Danny Welbeck brace ensured the crowd went home happy. 

The crowd inside the stadium reached 82,000, more than double the amount that watched the Norway clash

The attendance was the third highest in a year, only games against Peru and  Germany attracted more fans

Only 40,000 fans watched England beat Norway at Wembley, the smallest crowd since its redevelopment

It was the third time Wembley had hosted an international game since Hodgson's men crashed out of the group stages in South America, and each time the crowd has increased in size.

In the friendly against Norway in September, just 40,000 fans attended the game - making it Wembley's smallest crowd since its redevelopment in 2007. 

The following game, a Euro 2016 qualifier against San Marino, saw a small rise. But at 56,000 Wembley was still only 60 per cent full.

But Saturday's crowd saw a radical improvement, only May's 3-0 win over Peru and the 1-0 loss to Germany in November 2013 have drawn bigger crowds in the last 12 months.
