From stretchy leggings to billowing tunic tops and tent dresses, the wardrobe of the average mother-to-be isn't always a particularly glamorous affair.

But that could all be about to change if Chanel supremo Karl Lagerfeld gets his way, after he closed the French fashion house's latest show with a pregnant bride.

Dressed in an elegant crêpe de Chine gown with a gold brocade cape and a neat line of buttons along the bodice, the model, her hair teased into a striking quiff, even allowed herself a smile as she processed along the runway on the arm of the German designer.

Cheered on by a crowd of clapping fashionistas, among them US Vogue's Anna Wintour, Kristen Stewart and Jared Leto, the pair stopped to take a bow at the end of the runway before the model planted a kiss on Lagerfeld's cheek.

It was a dramatic end to a dramatic show which offered up a glimpse of Lagerfeld's romantic vision for autumn: one replete with sculptural shapes and elegantly cosy textures.

Brocade, tweed and heavy silk all featured heavily, as did gorgeously touchable prints - many of which appeared inspired by William Morris and the pre-Raphaelites.

In a departure from last January's S/S14 collection where models clad in neat, knee-length dresses and trainers took centre stage, Lagerfeld's vision for winter took a darker turn with marabou-fringed tweed and bodices studded with armour-like jewels taking centre stage.

Darkly beautiful: Highlights included a red and black distressed tweed dress and a gunmetal gown

Classic: As ever, there was plenty of Chanel's trademark tweed

Sculptural: Bell skirts, albeit covered in sequins, dominated

Elaborate: A model in a striking silver-grey lace dress

But while ladylike might be back, heels, it seems, are not - at least according to Lagerfeld and Chanel.

Instead of skyscraper shoes, models on the catwalk at the Grand Palais des Champs-Elysées in Paris wore delicate flat sandals in black, silver and white, each one tied in place with pretty grosgrain ribbons.

They might not have been the most practical of winter shoes but for well-heeled pregnant mothers like the star of the show, they could be just what the doctor ordered.
