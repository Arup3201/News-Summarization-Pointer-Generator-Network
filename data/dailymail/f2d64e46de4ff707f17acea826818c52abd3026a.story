It is a hammer blow for Fulham fans. Felix Magath has declared that he wouldn’t sign Brazilian superstar Neymar, even if he had the chance to get him for free.

Despite the club playing Championship football next season, Magath sees no role at Craven Cottage for one of the best players in the world.

The Fulham manager appeared on Germany’s major TV channel ZDF after Argentina’s victory over Switzerland, to give his own expert view on the World Cup. Talking to former Bayern Munich star Hasan Salihamidaic, the German coach said that he didn’t like players like Neymar.

Going alone: Neymar scores a lot of individual goals - according to Magath

'I like team players. Players like Neymar, where it’s all about the individual scoring goals... I don’t know,' said Magath, before breaking into sheepish grin, 'I probably wouldn’t even take him for free'.

Salihamidaic’s reaction was one of visible shock, and the Bosnian couldn’t help but burst out laughing.

Even as a tongue-in-cheek remark, it was a bold claim from Magath, who faces the mammoth task of reshaping Fulham’s squad for the Championship following their relegation in May.

He did offer optimistic Fulham fans a glimmer of hope though, saying: 'If Neymar wins the World Cup with Brazil, then maybe I’d consider it.'

Happily for the Craven Cottage faithful, Magath’s infamous love of the transfer market has not disappeared entirely. Asked which World Cup stars he would like to bring to Fulham, Magath said he thought Manuel Neuer had been outstanding, and that he’d always welcome Thomas Muller.

With those two transfers under his belt, perhaps Fulham wouldn’t even need Neymar to guarantee promotion next season.

Magath was also full of praise for Bastian Schweinsteiger, saying he was the 'right man' for Germany’s midfield. He claimed that the Bayern Munich player was a superior choice to Real Madrid’s Sami Khedira.

'Khedira can’t play the same leading role at the moment,' he said.

The Fulham boss then laid into Germany coach Joachim Low, saying that he had to stop playing captain Phillipp Lahm in midfield.

'Phillipp wants to play there, but it’s not about that. It’s about the team. For this team, he is more urgently needed as a left back. Benedikt Hoewedes can’t fulfil that role properly at the moment'.
