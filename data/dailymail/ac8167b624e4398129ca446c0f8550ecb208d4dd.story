These fascinating images show Yemeni grooms wearing traditional dresses and carrying swords during a mass wedding ceremony in Yemen - but their brides are nowhere to be seen.

Upon strict Muslim traditions practiced in Yemen, women have their own seperate celebration. The couples met later that night, many for the first time as many marriages in Yemen are arranged.

The Orphan Foundation charity organised the mass wedding ceremony for 4,000 couples in the capital Sana'a.

The £5million mass wedding ceremony, funded by Qatar's former Emir, Sheik Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, is expected to make the Guinness Book of World Records.

According to the foundation, representatives of Guinness Book of World Records arrived in Yemen on Wednesday night to document the ceremony as one of the largest communal weddings in the world.

The event assists orphaned individuals without family, who otherwise would not be able to afford a ceremony. Weddings are expensive in Yemen - bachelors have to pay their fiancée's family to marry their daughter. The groom and his father split the cost of a dowry to the bride's father, normally around £3,000, and the family of the groom is also expected to pay for the wedding expenses.

'To date, several mass weddings have been held, but this is the biggest one for orphans worldwide,' Khatab Al-Hemyari, the foundation’s public relations officer, told the Yemen Times.

He said the foundation has already submitted all the required documents to the Guinness World Record organization and asked them to include the Sana’a wedding in their famous book.

According to Al-Hemyari, the former Emir of Qatar Sheikh Hamad Bin Khalifa has personally funded the mass wedding, indicating that it is the first time Qatar is sponsoring such a project in Yemen.

The organiser targeted the parent-less community because they are often in need of support, particularly given the current economic situation, the foundation said. Poverty in Yemen is endemic, particularly in more remote and less accessible areas.

Ahmed Mohammed Al-Sedra, a 28-year-old groom participating in the mass wedding, said, 'I’m not able to get married as my father died 12-years-ago, and I don’t have a reliable source of income because I work in the construction sector and receive a low daily wage.

'I registered at the foundation two years ago and they requested proof that I hadn’t been married before or that I don’t have a family,' said Al-Sedra, who was given £430 for the ceremony, as well as clothes.
