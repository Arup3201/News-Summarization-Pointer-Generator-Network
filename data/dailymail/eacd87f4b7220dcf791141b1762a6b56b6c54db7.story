Pope Francis has been warned in a new book against relaxing the Catholic Church's ban on remarried divorcees receiving Communion.

The book is written by a powerful group of cardinals and is due to be published on October 1, just days before the Vatican has a meeting of bishops, where the issue of the Sacrament for divorcees who remarry, will be discussed.

The five cardinals maintain that divorce is not permitted and that anyone who then marries again in a civil ceremony is an adulterer.

A group of powerful cardinals have warned Pope Francis - seen here meeting with a delegation of 40 world Jewish leaders in Rome, today - against relaxing the Catholic Church's position on allowing remarried divorcees receiving the Holy Communion

In the book, Remaining in the Truth of Christ - Marriage and Communion in the Catholic Church - the group write: 'The authors of this volume are united in their firm belief that the New Testament shows us that Christ prohibited, without any ambiguity, divorce and any successive marriage on the basis of God's original plan.'

The cardinals, which include Gerhard Ludwig Muller, argue that on this basis they should not be allowed to receive the Sacrament.

The book goes against remarks made by Walter Kasper, a reformist cardinal close to Pope Francis, who in February, said the Church might relax its rules on remarried divorcees taking Communion.

Cardinal Kasper said the Vatican needed to help Catholics who divorce and remarry to continue to be involved in church life. He said the issue was a 'complex and thorny problem'.

The cardinals, however, have taken a hardline on the issue and want to follow the words of the Bible.Â 

Robert Dodaro, one of four theologians who collaborated on the book, told The Telegraph: 'This is one of those situations where we don't believe we have the authority to make any change because that would go against Christ's word in the Gospels.He added: 'The cardinals are not looking to be punitive towards divorcees. But they say that if the Church starts tolerating second marriages, what happened to the principle of the indissolubility of the first marriage?'Catholics who obtain an annulment or civil divorce are not barred from taking Communion, but those who remarry in a civil ceremony are.

In April the Pope reportedly told a woman who had remarried a man who had previously been divorced, that she could take the Holy Communion.
