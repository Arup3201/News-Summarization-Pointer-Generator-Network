Belgium's famous exports include beer and chocolate but did you also know they gave the world the Smurfs?

With the recent release of two Smurf 
movies attracting a new generation of fans to the franchise, the Belgian
 tourist board are hoping they can capitalise on the love of the dwarves
 to bring new visitors to their country.

The lovable blue characters were the invention of Belgian cartoonist Pierre Culliford, aka Peyo, who first drew them for a cartoon strip in 1958.

His comic strips and albums quickly 
became a hit in his native country and have since been translated into more than 30 different languages. When Hanna Barbera turned the 
comics into a TV cartoon series in the Eighties the Smurfs found even more global fame -
 so much so that many people are unaware of their European origins.

Marc Marghem, a tour guide at the Belgian Comic Strip Centre in Brussels - that has a whole section dedicated to the Smurfs - told MailOnline: 'The Smurfs have become so famous internationally that many people don't know where they are from. But they are definitely Belgians!'

The proud Belgians have never forgotten that the Smurfs are their own and the characters are celebrated in a number of venues across their capital of Brussels.

Still going strong: The Smurfs began as a cartoon strip in 1958, left. Now a new generation are fans thanks to the films using voices including Katy Perry's as Smurfette

In time for release of The Smurfs 2 on DVD and Blu-ray this month, from 20 December to 9 February the city will host the International Festival of Ice Sculptures for the first time, in the sumptuous setting of the Place des Palais.

Four hundred and twenty tonnes of natural ice will be transformed to recreate the world of the Smurfs and other children's favourites. And while the Smurfs are only meant to be 'three apples high', the ice sculptures will be up to six metres tall.

Away from the ice sculptures, Femail discovered there are other places where children (and big kids!) can immerse themselves in the world of the Smurfs while in Brussels.

As well as the aforementioned Comic Strip Centre, there's the Museum Of Original Figurines (MOOF) and the world's only Smurf store where fans can buy everything from Smurf-related books and figurines to T-shirts and mugs.

At the MOOF Museum, there's a display
 showing how the Smurfs went from a humble cartoon strip to Hollywood 
with today's big budget 3D films using the voice talents of stars 
including Katy Perry.

Sea of blue: The Moof has a display of Smurfs from giant statues to a model village

Museum exhibits: The figurines have become collectors' items and many are on show in the country's capital

Children
 can also marvel at the Smurf model village there and meet giant 
versions of their heroes. Both MOOF and the Comic Strip Centre detail 
how the Smurfs came to be with Peyo conceiving 99 Smurf characters - all
 male - with different personality traits and then adding a token 
female, Smurfette.

Feminists
 have slated the creator in the past for his lack of female characters 
and the MOOF reveals that the decision didn't go down well with his wife
 either.

It reveals: 'The 
way Peyo introduced the Smurfs caused a lot of resentment between him 
and his wife. The Smurfette was created by Gargamel, the villain, as a 
blend of the following 10 ingredients: 'a spark of coquetry, a large 
dose of prejudice, three tears of a crocodile, the brains of a shrimp, 
the tongue of a vampire, a little bit of wickedness, a handful of anger,
 a little bit of lies, deep fondness for sweets, a little bit of bad 
faith, a little bit of unpredictability, a streak of pride, a cup of 
envy, some sensitivity, a part of foolishness, a part of cunning, a 
handful of moodiness, two cups of stubbornness and an excess of waste.'

Matt
 Murray, author of the book The World of Smurfs: A Celebration of Tiny 
Blue Proportions, said the sexism is down to the Smurfs being a product 
of their time. He told The Atlantic: 'Let's face it, it's in the 
Sixties. Anyone who has seen an episode of Mad Men, or actually lived 
through the early-to-mid-'60s, knows that it wasn't exactly the best 
time to be a woman. And we're also talking about Belgium, and the whole 
Jacques Brel culture of celebrating your love through misery.'

There have been small attempts to redress the balance with Hanna 
Barbera adding some extra female Smurfs while the most recent film, The 
Smurfs 2, has a new female character voiced by Christina Ricci. 

Smurf world: The store has everything from figurines to towels, books and rucksacks

There's only one Smurfette: The other original 99 characters are male

Both the MOOF, the Comic Strip Centre and the Smurf store show how the characters have become a global phenomenon and their popularity has endured despite their apparent sexism and lack of modernism. They have even been able to transcend the death of Peyo in 1992 with the latest films creating original storylines for a new audience.

But Mr Marghem explains that comics like the Smurfs aren't just a means of entertaining children in Belgium. They also serve to educate by teaching them about historical and topical events.

For example in the Smurfs, the story King Smurf - where one of the Smurfs proclaims themselves King - aims to teach children about democracy and the dangers of dictatorships. Meanwhile the story Smurfs Versus Smurfs was based on Belgian politics and the turmoil caused by their Dutch and French divide.

The Comic Strip Centre also aims to celebrate cartoon strips as the '9th art form' and encourage children to be creative and draw their own characters as well as reading about them.

British children visiting the museums can learn more than just about cartoons thanks to the Smurfs first being written in Dutch and French. The cartoon displays give them the opportunity to learn the languages in a visual and easy to understand way.

And it's not just the Smurfs who cartoon fans can see when visiting the region. Belgium also gave the world another comic hero whose adventures have stood the test of time - Tintin.

There are displays dedicated to him at the MOOF and Comic Strip museums as well as other characters created by Belgian artists such as Asterix and Blake and Mortimer. They will all be included in the Brussels Ice Magic display.

Families keen to see the ice sculptures before they melt away in February can take advantage of the fact Eurostar operates from London St Pancras to Brussels with the direct journey taking just two hours. Return fares cost from £69 if booked in advance.

Art nouveau masterpiece: The Comic Book Centre is homed in an impressive building designed by Victor Horta in 1905

A visit to learn about the Smurfs in the
 festive season also provides an opportunity to visit the city's Christmas 
market including a fun fair and see the famous nativity scene in 
the Grand Place that includes live animals. 

The museums mentioned above are year round attractions and children can also do a comic book trail of the city, a kind of treasure hunt to find giant murals of cartoon characters that have been drawn on buildings around Brussels.

They can even have lunch surrounded by their favourite characters at the Comic Cafe in Grand Sablon which includes memorabilia from the Smurfs, as well as Disney and other global animators.

Accompanying adults are likely to be fans of the Smurfs themselves having also grown up with the cartoons. But if not, the architecture of the Comic Strip Centre is likely to wow them if the content doesn't. It was designed by Belgium's most famous architect, Victor Horta in 1905 as a textile factory in an art nouveau style.

The building was nearly destroyed - like some of Horta's other work - when art nouveau went out of fashion in the mid 20th century but was saved thanks to it becoming the home of the comics. The use of glass in the ceiling and floor tiles coupled with the mosaic floor makes it a light and airy space to display exhibits.    

And if the Smurf sightseeing all gets too much, parents can unwind after the exhibition visits with another Belgian speciality - beer.
