Onion rings: Francisco Barrera attacked a customer with a switch blade and stun gun after the customer asked to have his cold onion rings reheated

 What happened to 'Have it Your Way?'

A New Mexico man is suing Burger King after he was attacked by a manager with a stun gun and a switch blade after receiving cold onion rings, officials say.

The suit was filed by Robert Deyapp Oct. 1. Deyapp is seeking punitive damages for assault and negligent hiring and training following an incident that occurred June 2013 at a Bloomfield, New Mexico Burger King, according to Courthouse News Service. 

Deyapp reportedly tried to return his cold onions rings, asking for them to be reheated, when the restaurant's manager Francisco Barrera, 31, began making remarks about him in Spanish to a nearby employee.

The Daily Times reports that Deyapp's complaint described Barrera saying this: 'This white boy is mad about his food and he doesn't even know that I'm going to return it and do whatever I want to it and he'll still eat it and never have any idea of what I did to his food.'

Unfortunately for Barrera, Deyapp speaks fluent Spanish, according to the complaint. 

DT reports that Deyapp refused the onion rings and asked for a refund after hearing the remarks and  Barrera then began taking photos of Deyapp and his vehicle.

The complaint states that Deyapp confronted Barrera about taking the photos and that's when Barrera attacked him with a stun gun and a switchblade.

Deyapp reportedly avoided being injured until the police arrived.

Barrera was arrested and later charged with aggravated assault in June, DT reports. In September, he was sentenced to one year probation and ordered to take an anger management course, court records state.

DT reports that though Barrera was arrested and charged for the assault, Deyapp's story deviates wildly from that told at the time of Barrera's arrest more than a year ago.

Decline: A Burger King spokesperson declined to comment on the situation saying that Burger King doesn't comment on pending litigation

At the time of the arrest, Deyapp reportedly told police that Barrera followed him out of the restaurant with the stun gun and switchblade after the two argued, according to the arrest warrant.

A woman who saw the incident allegedly told police that after the two argued and Barrera began taking photos of Deyapp, Deyapp provoked Barrera and mockingly invited him to take photos of his truck as well.

Also, Barrera claimed that he armed himself with the stun gun and switchblade after Deyapp threatened to get a gun from his truck, according to an affidavit.

Now, more than a year after the incident, Deyapp is suing Burger King, Barrera, and several Burger King associates saying that the Burger King Corp., is guilty of negligent training, hiring and retention, according to DT. 

KRQE reports that the law suit states that Barrera has a history of being violent with customers and co-workers even prior to the June 2013 incident.

The Associated Press reported that a Burger King spokesperson declined to comment on the situation saying that Burger King doesn't comment on pending litigation.
