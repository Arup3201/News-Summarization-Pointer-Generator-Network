Luke Campbell extended his unbeaten professional record to nine fights with a ruthless fifth-round stoppage of Daniel Brizuela at Hull Ice Arena on Saturday night.

Campbell, who won gold in the 56kg Bantamweight division at London 2012, took control early on in the fight and landed a series of shots with ease in the first two rounds while the Argentinian struggled to make any headway at all.

Brizuela (26-3-2 8KOs), finally showed signs of life in the third round with a stinging two-punch combo but he looked wobbly as Campbell fought back and had him on the ropes at the end of the three minutes.

The next two rounds were like a game of cat and mouse, with Brizuela manfully delaying the inevitable but causing Campbell no problems as the Hull lightweight searched for the killer blow.

The 27-year-old almost found it when a barrage of blows sent Brizuela down in the fifth, but with 45 seconds remaining he got back to his feet almost immediately.

For a time Brizuela was doing well to dodge Campbell's flurry of combos, but with each weave he looked increasingly unsure on his feet and referee Ingo Barrabas called a halt to proceedings.

Speaking after the fight Campbell, who has been tipped to take on fellow Hull-based fighter Tommy Coyle, said he was delighted to have made the step up against a strong opponent.

'I knew what I was up against, a very tough durable kid. He was coming to win,' he told Sky Sports 2.

'He's got a very good record, very experienced and been around so for me to go in there and do that I'm really happy with myself I'm over the moon. I'm a bit overwhelmed with the crowd and all the support I've had here tonight.'
