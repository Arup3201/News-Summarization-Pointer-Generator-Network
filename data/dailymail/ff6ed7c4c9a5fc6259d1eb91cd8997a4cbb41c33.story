Gordon Strachan faces a growing headache over his starting line-up to face England on Tuesday night with all his star names desperate to be part of the action.

The Scotland boss had planned to rest most of those who battled their way to a bruising and draining Euro 2016 win over the Republic of Ireland.

But the players have told Strachan they are keen to face England in the Celtic Park friendly and the Scots boss is now rethinking his original plan to hand those on the edge of his first XI a Parkhead start.

After settling on a line-up over the weekend, Strachan admitted the issue is now far from decided.

‘I had an idea a couple of days ago - but the players who played the other night keep banging on that they are fit enough to play again,’ he said. ‘They’ re dropping hints everywhere I go.

‘I need to rethink my strategy. From the training today nobody wanted to be rested, that’s for sure.

‘It was like the first day of pre-season in training. We’ve so many players who want to play. There were a few bumps but it was old-school rub it down and get on with it.’

Despite the Ireland game dominating the national mindset for the last month, a rare chance to face the Auld Enemy in a reprisal of the world’s oldest international fixture holds huge appeal for Strachan’s squad.

‘I would say a wee bit of that is because it’s the fixture,’ he admitted. ‘We’ re only human

‘If someone said to us we are playing some team that’s 70-odd in the rankings we wouldn’t be as excited around this table, all of us. We’re only human. We only want real, competitive games. This is a competitive game for different reasons, even if there are no points available.’

Strachan planned to field the likes of goalkeeper Craig Gordon, Manchester United’s Darren Fletcher and West Brom’s James Morrison – posted missing from the Ireland game with a severe virus.

Morrison’s condition has improved, but both he and Fletcher are still doubts after the Old Trafford man failed to train on Monday.

That could force Strachan to turn to old stagers like Scott Brown and Charlie Mulgrew for their second international game in a week – despite an intense workload at club level.

Playing down suggestions of tiredness amongst his squad, the Scots boss added: ‘It’s not so much the players who say it, it’s the coaching staff.

‘As one famous manager said “I’ll tell you when you’re tired”. When he asked the question “who’s tired in here?” and some unfortunate kid put their hand up and we just stood by and watch him get terrorised.

‘You have to remember Messi and Ronaldo, Barcelona, Real Madrid, Chelsea, they’ re all playing 60-odd games. The top players’ mindset is “play, play, play” so then what you think is hard work is not hard work to them, it’s the norm.

‘Top players now have to play 60 games a season. If you want an easy life go to a mediocre Championship club and you can get nine weeks break sometimes. If you want to be a top player get your mind around playing every week and dealing with that.’

Opposite number Roy Hodgson arrived with his squad on Monday afternoon and immediately took the opportunity to familiarise them with Celtic Park.

Hodgson is buoyed by last year’s 3-2 win over Scotland at Wembley although a disappointing World Cup campaign means he does not have to look far for critics.

A less than exciting European qualifying group for England means the fixture has an added air of importance and Hodgson is looking forward to tasting the white hot atmosphere.

‘The fans here, they’ll certainly give Celtic and Scotland incredible support and that’s something we’ll have to deal with in terms of not letting it affect us too badly mentally, he said.

‘For some of our younger players they won’t necessarily have experienced that type of atmosphere in their careers.’

When asked which fixture between the two nations stood out in his mind, he replied: ‘The one that we played last year at Wembley. It was an excellent game, very, very close, very well-fought and incredible atmosphere because a lot of Scottish fans had travelled down to Wembley for the game.

‘It’s a very exciting game, it’s a big game. We know we’ll be given a very tough test up here and we know that Scotland will be very keen to win the game and I’m certainly hoping that we have the same degree of hope and expectation from our side.’
