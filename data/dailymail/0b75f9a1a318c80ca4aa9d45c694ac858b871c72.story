A driver has been photographed watching a video on his iPad after shocked witnesses spotted him drifting in and out of his lane for 12 kilometres.

The distracted driver drifted between lanes while driving along Queens Road and the Princes Highway in Chadstone on Sunday night, his iPad screen shining brightly the entire time.

A witness, Tony Margaritis from Rowville, said he spotted the car's erratic lane changes and was shocked when he pulled alongside the driver and saw he was watching a movie.

i-Idiot: A man was caught watching a video on his iPad as he drove through Chadstone in Melbourne on Sunday night

'At first I thought it was just another drink driver and as we pulled up beside him we saw he was watching TV,' Mr Margaritis told the Herald Sun.

When he stopped beside the driver at a set of traffic lights, Mr Magaritis' wife asked the man if he realised how stupid he was being, but the driver just shrugged his shoulders and sped off. But not before the couple snapped a picture of him and his device.

Police have slammed the driver's behaviour as dangerous and stupid.

The witness who photographed the driver initially thought he was drunk because he was weaving in and out of traffic for about 12km

'There is no excuse for using an iPad, reading a book, using a mobile phone or engaging in any of the other distractions while driving a vehicle,' Road Policing Command Inspector Simon Humphrey said.

'If it's convenient to use this type of the equipment on the road, then do offenders also think it's convenient for their family to be told they've killed someone else or themselves?'

But police have warned they would rather drivers take down the licence plates of dangerous drivers rather than stop to take photos.
