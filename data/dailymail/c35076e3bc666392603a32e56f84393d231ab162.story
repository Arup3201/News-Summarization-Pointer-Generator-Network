Nicola Peltz has skyrocketed to stardom through her role as Mark Wahlberg's daughter in Transformers: Age of Extinction, but the blonde-haired beauty is also the daughter of a billionaire off screen.

The 19-year-old heiress, from Westchester, New York, proved to be a vision in white at the Transformers: Age Of Extinction premiere in Berlin, Germany on Sunday.

And Nicola, who's father Nelson Peltz once owned the Snapple brand and is a successful hedge funder, reprised the colour at a press conference for the film today.

Vision in white: Nicola Peltz showed off her slender legs in a dress featuring a lacy skirt over a leotard style top at a Transformers: Age Of Extinction press conference in Berlin, Germany on Monday

The  teenage actress showed off her slender legs in a dress featuring a lacy skirt over a leotard style top.

She dressed it up with nude pointed-toe platform pumps and wore her blonde hair in sleek waves with a centre part.

Nicola sat in-between her co-star Jack Reynor and director Michael Bay during the conference, and appeared in high spirits.

It
 was certainly a great day for the cast and crew, as the fourth 
Transformers film took in $41.6 million on its opening day on Friday, 
making for the greatest opening day of 2014.

It went on to bring in $100 million over the weekend in the US, making for the greatest opening weekend of 2014 so far.

The film performed impressively outside of the US as well, garnering $201.3 million for a worldwide total of $301.3 million.

In
 the fourth robot film, Nicola stars as the daughter of an automobile 
mechanic, played by Mark Wahlberg, with whom she makes a discovery that 
brings down the Autobots and Decepticons.

But
 the pretty blonde is keen to point out the differences between her 
character and those played by leading ladies Megan Fox and Rosie 
Huntington-Whitely before her.

She recently told Interview magazine: 'I play a daughter, so this one is different. She is younger than the other Transformers girls.

'Rosie [Huntington-Whiteley, star of Transformers: Dark of the Moon] was about 24, and I play 16 or 17.

Congrats! It was certainly a great day for the cast and crew, as the fourth Transformers film took in $41.6 million on its opening day on Friday, making for the greatest opening day of 2014

'My character is still in high school. She’s not allowed to have a boyfriend. It’s a father-daughter story.'

Fox played Mikaela Banes in the first 2007 Transformers movie and its 2009 sequel Revenge Of The Fallen. 

Set
 four years after third installment Transformers: Dark of the Moon, the 
new movie is the first flick not to feature original leading actor, Shia
 LaBeouf, but does star Kelsey Grammar and John Goodman.

Like its predecessors, the film was directed by Michael Bay and executive produced by Steven Spielberg.

Promotional circuit: Mark Wahlberg attended a press conference on Monday for the film in Berling

Action star: Mark has the leading role in the latest move in the Transformers franchise

International stars: Mark talked about the film as co-star Li Bingbing looked on

Big opening: Mark plays a single father and struggling inventor in the latest Transformers film

Nicola
 is the daughter of billionaire businessman Nelson Peltz and former 
model Claudia Heffner, and has one sister and six brothers.

Her 72-year-old father made his fortune as the founder of hedge fund firm, Trian Fund Management, which invests in 'high quality but undervalued and under-performing public companies' and works with management and their boards to 'enhance value for all shareholders,' according to its website.

In one case, Peltz acquired the struggling brand Snapple in 1997 from Quaker Oats for $300 million, and subsequently sold it for $1 billion to Cadbury Schweppes in 2000.

Quaker Oats paid $1.7 billion for Snapple in 1993 in a bidding war with Coca-Cola and other parties, though the beverage brand lost $1.4 billion in value over the next four years, before Peltz helped facilitate its turn-around. 

Do the math: The film performed impressively outside of the US as well, garnering $201.3 million for a worldwide total of $301.3 million

Nicola is currently single, and she has a wise head on her shoulders 
when it comes to selecting the right type of man to date.

‘My
 friends ask me for advice about guys, because I have so many brothers 
and I see what guys go through,’ Nicola told Interview.

‘And
 there's just this stage in a guy's life where they need to be free and 
have fun and just be independent and enjoy their life.

‘And,
 no offense, boys are more immature than girls. Knowing that and not 
wanting any BS in my life - not having time for it - you just have to be
 smart about it.
