More than than eight million two-earner couples will be more than £1,330 better off on average next year as they gain a double benefit from the Government's flagship tax cuts.

A Treasury analysis seen by the Daily Mail shows that 8.3 million families are winning twice from increases to the personal allowance for income tax, because both adults are in work.

The amount of earnings on which no tax is paid will rise to £10,600 in April - the latest in a series of rises implemented by the coalition.

Of the 8million families who are better off, 3.4million have children, including 300,000 in Scotland, 200,000 in Wales and 400,000 in the South East

The most detailed study to date on the impact of the reform shows nurses, care workers, sales assistants and teachers are among the occupations to have benefited most from the coalition’s most radical tax policy.

People living in the South East have done best, with those in the North West next most likely to have benefited.

Ministers will hail the figures as evidence of the most fundamental change in the personal tax system for a generation - implemented despite the need for austerity measures.

However, they risk fuelling a row over the Government's decision to target support at two-earner families.

Tory MPs have complained of a growing discrepancy in the tax system between increasingly generous support for working couples with children and that for parents where a spouse stays at home to look after the children.

On top of income tax breaks, the coalition has committed to introduce ‘tax free childcare’ for dual earner couples worth up to £2,000 a year per child.

The Chancellor is introducing a marriage tax allowance from next April designed to help one-earner couples, but it will be worth only around £200 a year. The married tax allowance will only apply to people paying the basic rate of tax, meaning that families with incomes above around £42,000 a year will not be helped.

A total of 2.7million people will have been taken out of paying tax altogether when the personal allowance reaches £10,600 in April

David Cameron has suggested that a majority Conservative government would seek to go further, calling the tax break ‘very much a first step’. Labour and the Lib Dems are committed to scrapping the marriage tax allowance, however.

Today's analysis also shows that 5.6 families with children have benefited from the tax allowance change - with half of those securing a double advantage because they have two parents in work. Dual income families would be better off by an average of £2,100 if the allowance was to rise to the target amount of £12,500, the policy of both the Conservatives and the Lib Dems.

Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander said the 'Liberal Democrat flagship policy' had brought about the 'greatest revolution in the tax landscape for working people in living memory'

Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander said the 'Liberal Democrat flagship policy' had brought about the 'greatest revolution in the tax landscape for working people in living memory',

'Many will remember that the Conservatives dismissed the policy during the leadership debates running up to the election in 2010 as unaffordable but Nick Clegg and I have fought tooth and nail to keep the successive rises in the personal allowance on the table at every Budget,' the Cabinet minister said.

Mr Alexander's remarks are calculated to infuriate the Tories - who will today seek to put tax cuts at the heart of their campaign to stay in power. The coalition parties are engaged in a fierce battle to win credit from voters for the income tax breaks.

'Raising the personal allowance is an income tax cut for over 26 million working people worth £825 to typical basic rate taxpayers. And this new analysis reveals for the first time that dual earning households will be £1,330 better off on average,' Mr Alexander added.

'Many will remember that the Conservatives dismissed the policy during the leadership debates running up to the election in 2010 as unaffordable.

'But Nick Clegg and I have fought tooth and nail to keep the successive rises in the personal allowance on the table at every Budget.

'This analysis shows that our policy is benefitting working people and families the length and breadth of Britain. Recovering from the crash of the Labour years is a long process. There is a lot more to be done to fully repair the economy and to continue to get the financial pressure of families.

'That’s why we Liberal Democrats are committed to raising the personal allowance still further, to £12,500 over the next Parliament. 

'That will deliver a further tax cut of £380 pounds to a typical basic rate tax payer and a further boost of £770 to dual income households. And this policy helps make our economy stronger and fairer in other ways too. It helps keep spending power in the economy and makes being in work pay.'

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said: ‘These figures underline like never before the sheer scale of the tax cuts delivered by the Liberal Democrats for working households across Britain. Many, including the Prime Minister, said it could not be done, but Danny Alexander and I have cut taxes for low and middle earners while pulling our country's economy back from the brink where it was left by Labour. And it's not over yet. 

'The Liberal Democrats may have cut people's taxes by £825 but if we are in government again after 2015, we will cut them by a further £380 by raising the point at which you start paying tax to £12,500.'

The Treasury figures show that 784,000 nurses and 821,000 working in school classrooms have gained the full benefit of the increase in the amount of tax-free income that can be earned.

The largest number of families with children that will benefit from the personal allowance increase are from the South East at 800,000, followed by 700,000 from the North West.

The analysis also shows that 2.7 million workers will be taken out of tax altogether under the Government’s increases to the personal allowance, of which 300,000 are national minimum wage workers.

In total, 50 per cent of people on the minimum wage who had been previously paying income tax will be taken out of tax altogether by April.
