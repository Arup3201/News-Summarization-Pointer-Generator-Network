Who can stop the awesome Rory McIlroy? Another week, another victory for the Open Champion who now has the Claret Jug in one hand and his first World Golf Championship title in the other after catching Sergio Garcia to win the Bridgestone Invitational on Sunday.

Just to put the tin lid on another glorious Sunday for the Northern Irishman, he also reclaimed world No 1 spot for the first time since March last year. 

The 25-year-old looks so good right now it might be some time before anyone gets a look-in again.

Sequels don’t normally live up to the promise of the original but there were no complaints from the thousands of enthralled spectators who turned up to watch Rory versus Sergio, part two.

The first instalment was at Hoylake two weeks ago, of course, where McIlroy held off a charging Sergio Garcia on the final day. This time it was Rory who had to do the chasing. A fast start was desirable and McIlroy duly obliged with birdies on each of the first three holes. With Garcia bogeying the third, a three stroke deficit had become a one stroke advantage.

Garcia’s bogey had come about following a wayward drive that struck a woman on the hand with such force it knocked the diamond out of her ring. Thankfully it was found after an increasingly frantic search. Would Garcia find his previously impeccable golf game?

Credit the Spaniard. He fell two behind following another McIlroy birdie at the 5th but stuck to his task to such an extent they were level once more by the turn after a rare McIlroy bogey at the 8th was followed by a Garcia birdie at the 9th.

Keeping pace with McIlroy these days though is akin to holding off Tiger Woods at his best. Once he got his nose in front again at the 11th, the closing holes took on the flavour of the inevitable.

The pressure McIlroy was exerting told on Garcia as he bogeyed the 15th. The lead was two with just three holes to play. Garcia had a chance to halve the arrears at the 17th but his birdie putt from 10ft slipped by. McIlroy was home and dry, with the margin of victory proving the same as at The Open - two strokes.

And so McIlroy had lived up to his promise on the eve of the event to keep his head down and build on the momentum of that Claret Jug success rather than enjoy it.

For him to return to the top of the world rankings, he not only had to win but Scott had to finish outside the top five. For most of the round Scott was fourth or better but, just to confirm this was McIlroy’s day, he bogeyed three holes in a row from the 14th.

It was hard not to feel for Garcia. The last time he was playing as consistently well as this it was Tiger Woods who was invariably snatching titles from his grasp. Now it is Tiger’s heir apparent.

At least this time he isn’t consumed by feelings of jealousy or bitterness as he was back then. He might not like Tiger but his respect for McIlroy was obvious as the pair chatted away happily down the 18th fairway, and there was genuine warmth in his congratulatory handshake on the final green.

Next up for McIlroy and Garcia is the season’s final major, the USPGA Championship this week, where McIlroy will try to emulate the feat of Lee Trevino in 1971, when he won two majors in the space of a month, with a Canadian Open victory sandwiched in between. Few would bet against him.

In the battle to impress the Ryder Cup captains as the deadline for automatic qualifying draws ever nearer, top marks went to Americans Keegan Bradley and Patrick Reed.

Bradley was a star of the last match at Medinah and would have given US captain Tom Watson something to smile about at the end of a calamitous week by finishing tied fourth.

Similarly Reed, who moved into the last automatic slot when Dustin Johnson announced his withdrawal from consideration for personal reasons earlier in the week. Reed responded with a flourish, with a final round 65 to finish alongside Bradley.

Phil Mickelson and Lee Westwood showed signs of coming back to form with their eye-catching rounds of 62 and 63 respectively but there was no big week for the likes of British quartet Jamie Donaldson, Stephen Gallacher, Luke Donald or Ian Poulter, who all finished well down the field.
