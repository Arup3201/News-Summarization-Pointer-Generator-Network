An 18-year-old from the upscale Dallas suburb of Highland Park has been charged with sexually assaulting an underage classmate.

Highland Park police on Monday arrested Ryan Romo on a charge of sexual assault of a child. The high school senior was released from jail the following day on a $100,000 bond.

The alleged victim, a underclassman who attends the Highland Park High School with Romo, told police she bumped into Romo at a concert on Saturday night and then left the venue with him, according to KDFW-TV.

The pair took a cab to Romo's Chevy Tahoe and he then drove the SUV to a street, where they parked and began making out, according to an affidavit.

The victim said they were kissing in the back seat but he refused to stop when she protested his sexual advances.

The girl said she told Romo, ‘No, I don’t wanna do this,’ and screamed ‘stop,’ but Romo did not listen, according to the document.

When she arrived home, her mother noticed she was upset and the girl revealed the alleged ordeal.  

A sexual assault test performed on the girl at the Medical Center of Plano and a second exam performed by the girl's regular gynecologist confirmed signs of vaginal trauma.

Highland Park Police recorded two phone calls between Romo and the girl in which he admitted to having sex with her without a condom and also offered to buy her an emergency oral contraception.

On Monday, in a recorded phone call, Romo told her, ‘I had fun. We should definitely hang out again,’ according to the affidavit.

In another taped conversation she told Romo, ‘I just wish it didn’t happen like that, you know like?’ according to the Dallas Morning News.

In the recording, he agreed with her and she continued, ‘Like I wish, cause, I said stop … I said no. … I wish you’d stopped you know or not done it.’

Romo said, ‘Ok, you’re making me feel bad, wow.’
