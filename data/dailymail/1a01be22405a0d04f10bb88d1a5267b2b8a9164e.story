Police have released CCTV footage in the hunt for two men who sexually assaulted a woman while wearing Scream masks on Halloween.

The images, from Greater Manchester Police, appear to show the men walking near the Oasis Centre in Denton, Manchester on October 31. 

It was shortly before the sexual assault of a 22-year-old woman as she walked along Sunningdale Road in Haughton Green.

The two suspects were captured on CCTV walking near the Oasis Centre in Denton, Manchester shortly before the assault on Halloween 

Soon after the men were filmed on CCTV, a 22-year-old woman was assaulted as she walked along Sunningdale Road in Haughton Green

One of the suspects can be seen wearing a Scream mask - made popular by the main character in the 1996 horror film of the same name.

The disguise is based on the work of Norwegian artist Edvard Munch.

Police say the woman was tackled by men wearing the ghost-face masks, between 7pm and 7.20pm on October 31, but was able to struggle free and raise the alarm.

One of the men is said to be tall and wearing white trainers, while another is described as of a chubbier build in his early teens

Detective Sergeant Dave Donlan said: 'It has been more than three weeks since this woman suffered a horrible ordeal at the hands of four individuals who were dressed in Halloween-type masks.

'We are continuing with our inquiries to identify all those involved in the attack, and have now released CCTV footage of two men we need to speak to as part of our investigation.

'One of the men in the CCTV can be clearly seen wearing the Scream mask used in the attack.

'I would urge anyone who recognises these two men, or the men themselves, to come forward as soon as possible.

'This woman went through hell that night and we need to find those responsible.

'Justice is the least she deserves. 

'I would therefore reiterate that if anyone does know something, please come forward and talk to us, anonymously if needed.'

The footage can be viewed on GMP’s YouTube page.

Anyone with information is asked to contact Greater Manchester Police on 101.
