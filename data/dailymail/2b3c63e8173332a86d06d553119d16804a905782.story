MORE than 100 genetically-modified babies with three parents could be born each year in Britain, it emerged yesterday.

The Government has published draft rules that will allow IVF doctors to make babies free of devastating diseases that can kill hours after birth.

In a world first, the law could be changed by the end of this year – paving the way for the first GM babies to be born next year.

Scientists could soon create embryos using DNA from three people - a man and two women - to prevent mothers from passing on genetic diseases. Stock image pictured. The Department of Health is starting a public consultation on the rules to gather as many views as possible before introducing its final regulations

Initially, just ten babies with three 
genetic parents are expected to be born annually, but this could climb 
to 125, the Department of Health said last night.

Supporters
 of the advanced IVF technique say it will give couples who have endured
 the heartache of repeatedly miscarrying or burying much-longed-for 
children the chance to have a healthy family.

But
 critics have accused the Government of a ‘truly frightening’ neglect of
 safety and ethics. They argue that no one can guarantee the health of 
children born this way and say genetically engineering eggs and embryos 
crosses a critical ethical line and is banned in most countries. Done 
differently, it could lead to the creation of ‘perfect’ babies, made to 
order by hair or eye colour.

About
 one in 200 children every year in Britain is born with a mitochondrial 
disorder, faults in a cell's energy source that are contained outside 
the nucleus in a normal egg.

Mistakes in the mitochondria's genetic code
 can result in diseases such as muscular dystrophy, epilepsy, heart 
problems and mental retardation.

The
 new techniques essentially involve removing the nucleus DNA from a 
healthy female donor's eggs and replacing it with the nucleus DNA of the
 prospective mother, either before or after fertilization.

After fertilization, the resulting child would inherit the mother's nucleus DNA - which contains most inherited traits like eye color and height - but the donor's healthy mitochondrial DNA.

Scientists 
say the DNA from the donor egg amounts to less than 1 per cent of the 
resulting embryo's genes.

The
 row centres on work being carried out at Newcastle University into 
incurable diseases caused by faults in mitochondria – the tiny 
sausage-shaped powerhouses inside cells that turn food into energy. 
These defects cause serious illness in one in 6,500 babies and are 
responsible for 50 genetic diseases, many of which kill in infancy.

Women
 carrying damaged mitochondria can also miscarry repeatedly and often 
face the heartbreaking choice of whether it would be kinder to remain 
childless.

To help them, 
scientists have developed techniques in which the mother-to-be’s 
diseased mitochondria are swapped with healthy ones from an egg donated 
by another woman.

Successful
 ‘mitochondrial replacement’ would allow the couple a healthy child that
 is genetically their own. As the changes would be passed down the 
generations, it would also eliminate the disease from future generations
 of the family.

Any child 
would have DNA from two eggs and one sperm – and so effectively have two
 mothers and one father – although the genetic contribution from the 
donated egg would be very small.

Yesterday,
 the Government laid out regulations that, if passed by Parliament, 
would allow fertility laws to be relaxed to allow the technique.

A
 three-month public consultation is under way, but the Department of 
Health said the question was not whether to allow the technique, but 
about how it is implemented.

Professor
 Dame Sally Davies, the Chief Medical Officer, said: ‘Allowing 
mitochondrial donation would give women who carry severe mitochondrial 
disease the opportunity to have children without passing on devastating 
genetic disorders. It would also keep the UK at the forefront of 
scientific development in this area.’

Even
 if the law is changed quickly, IVF treatment will not start until the 
fertility watchdog, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, is
 satisfied of its safety. Any clinics that want to offer the £20,000 
treatment would have to be approved by HFEA, which will also decide 
whether each specific case merits the treatment.

The egg donor – the third parent – would remain anonymous.

The
 topic is under discussion in the US, where earlier this week regulators
 heard it could take decades to confirm the safety of the technique.

Two Government safety reviews have already been carried out here and a third is under way.

The
 last assessment concluded that although there was nothing to suggest 
the technique would not be safe, no one could be ‘absolutely certain’ 
until the first children were born.

Critics say couples could adopt and point out that if something goes wrong, generations will be affected.

Dr
 David King, of the campaign group Human Genetics Alert, warned that the
 technique was a slippery slope that could lead to ‘a designer baby 
market’. He accused the Government of rushing to regulate before safety 
was satisfied and warned that the ‘unethical’ technique carried unknown 
risks to the child.

Josephine Quintavalle, of Comment on Reproductive Ethics, called the proposals ‘truly frightening’.

But
 Liz Curtis, of the Lily Foundation, which funds research into 
mitochondrial disease, said: ‘We meet too many families whose worlds 
have been turned upside down by mitochondrial diseases. We hope they can
 benefit from this as soon as possible.’
