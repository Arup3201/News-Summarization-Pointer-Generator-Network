Seateo the tiger caused a stir when he leapt on to the roof of a tourist safari jeep on a South African reserve and took a nap.

The eight-year-old, 500lb big cat refused to jump off the vehicle at the reserve in Free State and began gnawing at its spare tyre before nodding off.

Reserve owner John Varty  - who was driving at the time - said: 'I couldn't believe it when he started to sleep while we were driving along. That's the first time I've ever known this to happen.'

Relaxing: Seateo the exhausted tiger caused chaos when he took a nap on top of a tourist safari jeep on a South African reserve

Cheeky: The eight-year-old, 500lb big cat leapt on the roof at the reserve in Free State and began gnawing at its makeshift headrest before nodding off

Comfy: The sleepy tiger appeared very content on top of the car which was being driven at the time by reserve owner John Varty who had raised the animal

'I couldn't get him off until I went over some really rough ground that he didn't like.

'Seateo is a big softy. I raised him myself and he loves playing around with people and cars,' he added.

Mr Varty runs the Londolozi game reserve, which in Zulu means 'protector of living things. The reserve offers luxury safaris for tourists and boasts a wide range of animals.

Exiting: Mr Varty had to drive the car over rough stones in order to persuade the big cat to leap off of the roof of the car

He has worked for more than ten years to establish tiger sanctuaries in South Africa.

Tigers are now only found in the wild in parts of Asia and remote areas of Russia. Less than a century they prowled almost all of Asia.

There are no accurate estimates of the world tiger population, but overall numbers are thought to have fallen from around 100,000 in 1900 to about 3,200now, according to the Worldwide Fund  (WWF).
