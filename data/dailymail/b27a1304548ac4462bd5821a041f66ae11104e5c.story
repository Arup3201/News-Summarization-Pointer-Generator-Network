Tom Cruise has started the holiday season in style - by taking his seven-year-old daughter Suri to Disney World.

The A list star, 51, has been spotted at the resort in Orlando, Florida - while his son Connor tweeted his joy at joining his family, writing: 'Disney World!!!!!!!!'

Cruise is believed to be spending Christmas with Suri after his ex-wife, actress Katie Holmes took the little girl back to her hometown of Toledo, Ohio, for Thanksgiving.

Finally over: Tom Cruise has reached a confidential settlement with Bauer Publishing

Cruise was spotted at the theme park just days after reaching a settlement in his $50million lawsuit against the publisher of both Life & Style and In Touch magazine.

Holidaymaker Sydney Rae Davis tweeted yesterday: 'In Disney World, just had the best dinner of my life, And I'm in the same building as Tom Cruise. It's a GOOD day.'

Cruise is a familiar face at Disney World. He was pictured enjoying a break with Suri - dressed as Ariel from The Little Mermaid - in August 2012.

The pair were seen at a water park and for the best part of Suri's adventure, she got to stay in one of Disney's most coveted rooms, Cinderella's Castle Suite.

The room cannot be booked at any price, but it's often used by Disney for charity events and promotions.

Four stories above the Magic Kingdom sits Cinderella's Castle Suite, which is decorated as a 17th-century chamber, with a sitting room, bedchamber and bathroom off a private marble-floored foyer, reported People.

Staying in the suite includes access to a 24-hour concierge, ready to make your wish his command.

Originally conceived as an apartment for Walt Disney and his family to stay in while in Florida (unfortunately, Walt died in 1966, five years before Disney World opened), two queen-sized beds and a pullout couch can accommodate up to six people.

While Connor, now 18 and a DJ, joined his father and sister, it's unclear where his older sister Isabella is.

Isabella, who celebrated her 21st birthday on Sunday, has been living in London.

Both Connor and Isabella were adopted by Cruise and his ex-wife Nicole Kidman.

It's thought Cruise and Connor will join family at his 210-acre, mulit-million dollar ranch in Telluride, Colorado, for the rest of the holidays.

For Cruise, it will be time to reflect and relax after he sued Bauer Publishing over a pair of stories that suggested he had abandoned Suri after divorcing Katie Holmes in 2012.

However, in a statement on Friday, the
 publisher of the two tabloid magazines said it never intended to imply 
that the star had abandoned his daughter.

The
 statement from Bauer Publishing accompanied news that Cruise 
and the tabloids had reached a confidential settlement in a defamation 
case filed by the Mission Impossible star.

A rep for Cruise confirmed with MailOnline that the lawsuit had reached a private settlement.

His lawyer, Bert Fields, called the stories outrageous and said that Cruise spoke to his daughter frequently while working on a pair of movie shoots that kept him overseas.

The magazines' statements said they 
regret if anyone interpreted their stories as meaning Cruise had cut all
 contact to his daughter.

The defendants stated: 'Bauer Publishing, In Touch and Life & Style
 never intended to communicate that Tom Cruise had cut off all ties and 
abandoned his daughter Suri and regret if anyone drew that inference 
from anything they published.'

Cruise's attorney Fields previously told The Hollywood Reporter: 'Tom doesn't go around suing people.

'He's not a litigious guy. But when 
these sleaze peddlers try to make money with disgusting lies about his 
relationship with his child, you bet he's going to sue.'

But in bringing suit against Bauer, 
Cruise had to be willing to make public many private aspects of his 
personal life, including details regarding his role in the Church Of 
Scientology.

Nonetheless, Fields said over the summer to THR: 'Tom is going to want to push this one all the way.'

The private settlement of the lawsuit comes after MailOnline reported last month that Bauer Publishing was considering subpoenaing Tom's ex-wife Holmes.

Katie, 34, could have been called upon to speak in the deposition about her marriage and subsequent divorce to Tom.

The questioning no doubt would have led to whether Katie believes that Tom 'abandoned' their seven-year-old daughter Suri following the divorce - which is what both Bauer titles Life&Style and InTouch had claimed.

Sources close to the actress had already informed MailOnline that Katie would have been 'happy' to get the chance to speak 'freely about their marriage and split'.

Katie was said to be a practitioner of the church throughout their five-year marriage but left along with Suri as soon as she split with Tom.

During a heated exchange last September between the actor and the magazineâ€™s lawyers he was asked if Holmes had divorced him 'in part to protect Suri from Scientology'.

'Listen, I find that question offensive,' he said.

'I find it, those statements offensive. Like with any relationship, there are many different levels to it. You know, I, I find it very offensive. There is no need to protect my daughter from my religion.'

Radar also reported that Katie is said to have signed a confidentiality agreement with Tom as part of their split.
