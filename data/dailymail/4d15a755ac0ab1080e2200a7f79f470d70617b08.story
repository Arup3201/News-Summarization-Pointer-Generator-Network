Channel 4 is to screen a live six-hour house party to mark the 20th anniversary of an infamous rave.

The programme, which the broadcaster hopes will 'turn the TV into the ultimate DJ booth', is expected to feature sets by international DJs including Grandmaster Flash and Annie Mac.

It will mark the 20th anniversary of a free rave at Castlemorton near Malvern, in Worcestershire, which was attended by 40,000 revellers.

The show is to be free of adverts and interruptions and will be broadcast without commentary, the Independent reported.

Partygoers will be able to request tunes like they would in a real club, only via social media rather than shouting across the dancefloor.

The House Party event is also due to feature 'visual sets' - works by computer animators, graphic artists and video jockeys responding to the music being played.

The show will air from midnight on the evening of August 24 and run until 6am.

And anyone planning to watch it will have to stay up, for the show will neither be repeated nor made available on Channel 4's replay service, 4 on Demand.

Twenty years ago: Police check buses arriving in Castlemorton in 1992. The illegal rave was attended by 40,000 revellers

The 1992 rave at Castlemorton Common began when revellers set up their own impromptu site after police tried to end the Avon Free Festival.

The gathering lasted a week, attracting thousands more people, and authorities found it difficult to close it safely.

In its aftermath, the Tory government drew up legislation to bring an end to any more large illegal festivals.

The House Party night will begin with a two-hour documentary, hosted by Luther actor Idris Elba, exploring how clubbing has grown into a multinational business.

Former Home Secretary Michael Howard, Black Eyed Peas star Will.i.am and DJs Pete Tong, Armand van Helden and Paul Oakenfold are to be interviewed for the documentary.

Channel 4 arts commissioner Tabitha Jackson told the newspaper that 2012 was the 'perfect summer' for the event.

She added: 'Perhaps the most radically innovative element of the night is that, in direct contrast to the new on-demand TV landscape, House Party is a genuine one-off.

'It will not be repeated and it will not be available on 4oD.

'Like all the best club nights and parties if you want to be there you have to turn up.'
