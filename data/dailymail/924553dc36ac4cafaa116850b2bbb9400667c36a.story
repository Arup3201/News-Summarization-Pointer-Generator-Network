A ruthless nephew had his uncle shot dead in a gangland-style hit after a petty family feud over a flat-pack garden shed.

Stuart Horner, 32, had 44-year old Ian Taylor blasted by a masked hitman at virtually point blank range as the victim was sat in a car listening to music.

The pair had originally been 'bosom buddies' but fell out after father of five Taylor was caught stealing a flat-pack shed and blamed Horner for tipping off the police.

Just eight days before the killing in Baguley, near Wythenshawe, Manchester, Horner was overheard saying: 'I’ve got a gun, I’m going to get Ian.'

Horner and an accomplice Derek Cotterill, 26, were convicted of murder following a trial and were jailed for life yesterday at Manchester Crown Court.

Horner was ordered to serve a minimum of 27 years whilst Cotterill will have to serve 23 years in prison. It is not known who pulled the trigger and the murder weapon has never been found.

The jury was told that the feuding began in November 2010 after Horner had asked petty thief Taylor to 'steal a shed for him'.

Taylor was later arrested, charged and convicted of theft - but blamed Horner for turning him in. The victim was said to have 'frequently harangued' Horner and in the days leading up to the murder there were a number of family rows.

On June 5, Horner’s niece was christened.

Taylor was not invited and after the ceremony he began swearing at members of the family- and on the same day, Horner complained of the victim 'coming at him with a knife'.

Horner’s sister Melanie Horner told the court that later that day Mr Horner told her, ‘I have got a gun, I’m gonna get Ian'. Miss Horner described how she started crying and said ‘I hope you’re joking’.

But she added: 'Stuart put his arm round the back of my neck, kissed my forehead and said, "I’m only joking, it’s a bat" - he had a rounders bat hanging on his bedroom wall.'

Yet in a confrontation just hours before the shooting itself, Horner told his uncle 'my boys are coming back for you'.

At 11.10pm that night Taylor was blasted in the chest with a shotgun at close range by a masked killer as he sat in his friend’s red Citroen listening to music and having a few drinks. He was pronounced dead in hospital shortly after midnight.

Carl Cooper who had been in the car with the victim at the time of the killing but escaped unhurt said: 'I saw a figure at the passenger side. I heard an explosion.

'It took me a few seconds to dawn what had happened. Then Ian said "I’ve been shot". Ian slumped in his seat. I sat there for a few seconds, shocked.'

Horner was arrested the next day and gave a false alibi and was released on bail. He later gave an interview to a newspaper protesting his innocence saying: “I am not connected to this shooting at all.

'I want the people who are blaming me to apologise and they need to let me grieve for my uncle.

'I am part of the investigation because me and my uncle had had an argument and we did have family issues but they are personal. This has really damaged my family and people think I am a murderer but I am not.'

But police later received further intelligence that Horner and his cousin Cotterill were responsible for Taylor’s murder and rearrested him. Both men denied murder.

After the case Det Supt Julian Ross of Greater Manchester said: 'Ian was sat with a friend in the car, listening to music, when at least one shot was fired into the vehicle, hitting him in the chest and killing him.

'Only Horner and Cotterill know exactly what happened that night or what possessed them to arm themselves with guns and kill a man.

'We know Ian was involved in a long-running family feud with his nephew Horner, but absolutely nothing can justify their murderous actions that night.'

Det Ch Supt Darren Shenton, head of GMP’s Serious Crime Division, said: 'The murder weapon in this case is still outstanding, and we are continuing to try and locate it so it cannot be used to seriously harm or kill someone else.'

A third man Nathan Frazer, 18, stood trial for murder after telling a pal: 'I smoked somebody' but the case against him was dropped after he claimed he made up the account to 'get attention'.
