Victor Conte, of all people, is now helping Major League Baseball in its fight against Alex Rodriguez.

A-Rod sought the steroid guru last year in a hush-hush meeting set up by a former steroid-using football star, according to a report in Sunday’s New York Daily News. In addition to speaking with the Yankees third baseman, Conte said he also spoke several times with Anthony Bosch, a key figure in the Biogenesis steroid scandal.

Rodriguez told Conte that Bosch was his ‘nutrition guy,’ according to the report.

Conte infamously served four months in prison for heading a massive doping ring that involved professional athletes across multiple sports and gold medal Olympians out of his BALCO offices in San Francisco. Conte admitted supplying steroids to a litany of big name stars such as home run king Barry Bonds, former Yankees first baseman Jason Giambi, gold medal sprinter Marion Jones and former NFL linebacker Bill Romanowski, among others.

The ex-con spilled all the details on his dealings with A-Rod during a meeting last week with investigators.

Romanowski, a prolific steroid user during his time with the Oakland Raiders and Denver Broncos, brought Rodriguez uninvited to Conte’s office in May 2012 when the Yankees were in town for a series against the Oakland A’s, the Daily News reported.

The aging slugger met with the steroid guru to discuss ‘legal products that could give Rodriguez an edge,’ the paper reported Conte told investigators. After the meeting Conte is said to have dealt with Bosch, the accused ringleader of the Biogensis steroid ring that has resulted in MLB Commissioner Bud Selig handing down a total of 15 PED suspensions.

‘I flushed it out with Romo before they ever showed up at the office,’ Conte said. ‘I clearly told Romo it (anything he could do for Rodriguez) was about legal performance enhancement.’

The summit happened at Conte’s new digs, Scientific Nutrition for Advance Conditioning (SNAC), after Romanowki called to say he was with A-Rod and five minutes away, the paper reported Conte telling officials.

Despite not entering until Romanowski confirmed the office was empty, Conte told authorities Rodriguez never once asked about illegal PEDs during the 45 minute meeting, the paper said. The meeting resulted in A-Rod receiving a few shipments of legal over the counter supplements, including a protein that ‘promotes overnight healing of the little muscle tears that are the result of working out,’ according to the Daily News.

Conte is not under suspicion or investigation for any wrongdoing, but by shedding light on Rodriguez’s inner circle he may have given MLB more ammunition in its fight against the brazen ballplayer.

Rodriguez has steadfastly denied that he was a patient of Bosch since the two were first linked in January. Bosch ran Biogenesis, the south Florida anti-aging clinic at the center of the latest major sports doping ring.

‘The news report about a purported relationship between Alex Rodriguez and Anthony Bosch are not true. Alex Rodriguez was not Mr. Bosch's patient, he was never treated by him and he was never advised by him. The purported documents referenced in the story -- at least as they relate to Alex Rodriguez -- are not legitimate,’ a spokesperson for A-Rod asserted after a weekly newspaper in Miami made public documents that showed evidence of doping and payments between Bosch and several ballplayers including Rodriguez, suspended Milwaukee Brewers outfielder Ryan Braun and others.

Conte told investigators that Bosch was deeply entrenched in Rodriguez’s training regimen and that he spoke to his alleged second-coming over the phone at least twice last summer, reported the Daily News.

By proving Bosch was part of A-Rod’s inner-circle, even as it related to his legal supplement intake, MLB is one step closer to verifying evidence it can use when Rodriguez’s appeal is heard next month by an arbitrator.

Since admitting his crime and serving time in prison, Conte has become an anti-PED crusader warning MLB for years that athletes are still doping - that investigators had a sit-down about Rodriguez with the reformed PED peddler shows the lengths the league is willing to go to rid itself of the caustic Yankee.

Rodriguez, allowed to play until his appeal is heard, hit his first home run of the season Sunday.
