Plans to dump 12million tonnes of rock and soil in the Chilterns to make way for HS2 have caused outrage among conservationists.

Protestors claim plans to redistribute surplus material in the area of outstanding natural beauty in the south east of England, will 'desecrate' the area of 'precious natural heritage'.

Those in charge of the project say their proposals are an environmentally friendly way to dispose of the materials - and that the soil will be landscaped appropriately.

'Area of beauty': Plans to dump tonnes of soil and rock in the Chilterns, pictured, have infuriated conservationists

The Chilterns Conservation Board say a 35-hectare plateau near the village of South Heath, among other places, will be destroyed.

Steve Rodrick, the board's chief officer, said: 'An
HS2 engineer told a public meeting that "it will be landscaped and look
very nice."

'Words fail
me when I think that our precious national heritage is going to be 
desecrated by people with so little feeling for what is special and 
unique.'

'This is a cheapskate design with cheapskate solutions,' reported The Observer.

The plans were revealed in a 55,000-page draft HS2 Hybrid Bill submitted to Parliament last week by Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin.

Link: The project, estimated to cost around £50 billion, is intended to link London to Birmingham by 2026, with two branches then heading to Manchester and Leeds, via Sheffield, being built by 2033

It says the HS2 project will require demolition of 339 dwellings and 21 community facilities and destroy two areas of sites of special scientific interest (SSSI).

It also says HS2 will require 2,500hectars of high-quality and 2,300hectrares of poorer quality agricultural land and will directly affect 18 Grade II listed buildings.

Some 67 dwellings will be ‘significantly affected by noise from the operation of the railway,’ it adds.

Additionally, the Woodland Trust say 21 ancient woods will be destroyed.

The bill states that of the 12million 
tonnes of excavated material, 10,000 will be put into landfill. The rest
will be taken to the Chilterns.

Fury: Campaigners - given just 60 days to read the consultation report on HS2 - protest outside Parliament on last Monday

By keeping material in the area, managers
say they can avoid the costly - and environmentally damaging - process 
of taking the material away by lorry.

An HS2 spokesman said: 'HS2 will 
be built in the grain of the countryside and aims to reuse up to 91% of 
the material generated from building the line.

There are:

'By
creating landscaped earthworks and shaping soils along the track side 
to help capture the sound of trains, designers are both insulating the 
effects of the railway and dramatically cutting the amount of material 
that would have to be otherwise transported from the line by road.'

Work on HS2 is due to start in Spring and should be completed by 2026.

Speaking to a board of MP watchdogs shortly after he submitted the bill, Mr 
McLoughlin said he was ‘completely satisfied‘ the £50billion line from 
London to Birmingham was the only way to stop gridlock on Britain's 
rails.

The estimated cost of the full HS2 scheme - comprising phase one and phase two north of Birmingham - is £42.6 billion plus £7.5 billion for the trains.

Mr McLoughlin said he was confident the estimated £21.6billion figure for phase one could be reduced to £17.16 billion.

Lawyers for the Campaign to Protect Rural England (CPRE) have threatened legal action against the Government after only 60 days over Christmas and New Year holidays were given to read the 50,000 page document.

Consultation for the bill closes on January 24.

Labour backs HS2 but says PM David Cameron must ‘get a grip’ on ballooning costs while the TSSA rail union fears HS2 may become a ‘rich man’s toy’.
