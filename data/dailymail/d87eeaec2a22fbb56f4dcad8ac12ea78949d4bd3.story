The British ‘madam’ arrested on vice charges in the US was held after she approached a banker about investing in a company that would charge executives a fee to meet glamorous young women she dubbed ‘sugar babies’, it has been claimed.

Anna Gristina, 44, faces charges she secreted as much as £6.4 million from a New York prostitution business in offshore bank accounts.

But an aide to the Scottish-born mother of four says she was soliciting funds for a matchmaking company when detectives pounced on her.

Speaking exclusively to The Mail on Sunday, Vincent Parco said the firm, Verified Arrangements, aimed to match ambitious young women – the ‘sugar babies’ – with ageing ‘sugar daddies’.

It was based in a Manhattan flat that authorities claim was an exclusive brothel.

However, Gristina’s lawyers claim she enlisted Parco, a 61-year-old former investigator for New York State medical regulators, to ensure there would be no wrongdoing in the apartment.

Parco was ‘tasked’ with checking female recruits had upstanding backgrounds and male clients were not exaggerating their financial assets. ‘These ladies weren’t street hookers,’ Parco said.

‘They were single, smart girls looking for relationships with guys who shared their desire for love and money. My job was to ensure everyone was on the up and up.’

Gristina’s lead attorney, Peter Gleason, confirmed Gristina, who infamously posted online half-naked pictures of herself and her third husband, Kelvin Gorr, 38, was setting up a dating site that ‘would have rivalled Match.com’.

His client claimed in a statement from 
the New York jail where she is in solitary confinement that, far from 
earning millions, she has been struggling to pay university fees for one
of her daughters.

‘She came up with the notion of a dating agency to make a few bucks,’ Parco said.

A second woman, Jaynie Baker, 30, is reportedly being sought by prosecutors on suspicion she was Gristina’s partner.

Yesterday, it emerged that she is negotiating to turn herself in.

She too claims she is a matchmaker, not a madam.

Prosecutors claim they have videotape evidence of sexual encounters at Anna’s rented ‘love nest’ and say she was recorded boasting that she was protected by her friendship with police officers, FBI agents and politicians.

A prostitute called Lizzie claims men paid from £500 to £1,300 an hour for sex and Gristina charged up to £16,000 for women who accompanied clients – who included ‘royalty’ – on short breaks.

Gristina was arrested as she left the Morgan Stanley investment bank after meeting with wealth management adviser, David Walker, 47.

He has since been suspended.

‘He was a Wall Street guy she went to see to raise money for the dating agency,’ said Parco.

‘There was nothing wrong with it.’
