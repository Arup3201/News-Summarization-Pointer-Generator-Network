We are coming to the end of our New York filming for Made In Chelsea and after nearly two months in the Big Apple we thought it might be an idea if we saw the famous sights of the city.

So we trawled the usual tourist traps and where else to start but the Empire State Building. We popped up to the 86th floor viewing gallery with several of the other cast members - Binky Felstead, Louise Thompson, Rosie, Proudlock Jamie, Mark Francis.

I thought about re-creating the famous scene from Sleepless in Seattle with me as Tom Hanks and Binky as Meg Ryan, but there were too many people around and we didn't have a rucksack with a teddy bear in it.

I heart NYC: Spencer and the Made In Chelsea cast have been visiting the tourist sights during their last few weeks in New York

The view of the city was amazing and it was great to see all the other cast, but I can tell that quite a few of the team are getting a bit homesick now. Don't get me wrong we have had an amazing time over here but we are looking forward to being back in the UK.

Also there are times when living with Jamie Laing can be a bit testing – it's like trying to keep an energetic Labrador puppy in a small flat. He's cute and loveable but he bounces off the walls with his boundless energy.

He's also a bit of prankster and thought it was hilarious recently to raid my bedroom when I was asleep and film it. I've got to say I had a bit of a sense of humour failure at the time.

New Yorkers know how to do retail. When we open a shop in the UK, someone cuts a bit of ribbon and everyone claps, takes a picture and that's it. It's a bit different in the Big Apple, they turn the volume up to 11.

We were invited to a new beauty store opening on Madison Avenue by hair care range Coco Amo and this certainly wasn't a dull affair. The room was packed with top models in bikinis, myself and Jamie fitted right in and made some new friends along the way. 

Party on: Spencer and Jamie went to the Coco Amo launch party and fitted right in with a sea of bikini-clad models

On the downside, the diet has gone right out of the window. We are currently living off oversized New York deli sandwiches and doughnuts.

My flirtation with Dunkin Donuts Strawberry frosted donuts has now become a full-blown love affair – and they contain fifteen grams of fat, 280 calories and 14 grams of sugar – it would take a 20-minute fairly high intensity run to burn off just one of those babies.

We have been doing some work-outs and using the Forza T5 Super Strength to help burn the fat but we are planning to up the ante when we get back and so we've booked ourselves in to No 1 Boot Camp in Ibiza for the end of July.

The strict former Army PT instructors there should whip us into shape for summer back in the UK.

Lots of Love, Spenny.

Sweet treat: Spencer says it's hard to stick to a diet with so many foodie temptations in New York
