A pilot who crash-landed on a beach in New Zealand, then proceeded to crash again into the sea... and it was all caught on camera.

Pilot Dennis Horne, of Howick, Auckland, said he was flying from Ardmore to Whangarei when the plane's new engine cut out near Martins Bay.

He managed to safely land the six-cylinder, 120-horsepower Jabiru on the end on Martins Bay beach, on the Mahurangi Peninsula near Warkworth about 11.30am today.

Second time not so lucky: A pilot who crash-landed on a beach in New Zealand, then proceeded to crash again into the sea... and it was all caught on camera

The footage shows a crowd watching the aircraft taxiing along the Mahurangi beach, north of Auckland after the land.

The plane moves along, but starts to steer towards the edge of the water.

It then twists violently and the left wing wing hits the water, spinning the aircraft and forcing the nose to hit the water.

The plane then bounces on to its left wing and comes to a stop.

Remarkably the Mr Horne and the passenger were unharmed in the crash but the planeâ€™s propeller and wing were damaged.

Horne
 explained when the aircraft had landed on the beach he had transferred 
fuel from one wing to the other, but when he tried to take off again the
 airplane made contact with the water, causing the plane to 'nosedive' 
into the sand, breaking its propeller and damaging its wing, reported Stuff Nz.

A New Zealand Civil Aviation Authority spokesperson told Radio NZ they had not yet been notified of the incident.

The plane is now awaiting a truck that will tow it off the beach.
