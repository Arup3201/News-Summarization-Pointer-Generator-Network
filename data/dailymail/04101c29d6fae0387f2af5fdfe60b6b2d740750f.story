A Hollywood special effects artist has created stunningly realistic sculptures of iconic figures, including Abraham Lincoln and artist Salvador Dali.

Kazuhiro Tsuji, 45, from Kyoto City, Japan, worked for five months crafting the look-alike busts out of silicon, polyester, bronze and chrome plating.

And if they weren't life enough, the sculptures are made using real hair.

Mr Tsuji says that he chose to recreate Lincoln, who was assassinated by John Wilkes Booth in 1865, after seeing make-up artist legend Dick Smith's version when he started out in the industry at the age of 17.

Kazuhiro Tsuji,  from Kyoto City, Japan, spent months crafting the busts of Abraham Lincoln and Andy Warhol

The 45-year-old was inspired by Dick Smith's version of Lincoln when he started out in the industry aged 17

He said: 'I choose my subject based on what is going on in my life at the moment.

'Lincoln was a great human being and a hero to many people. I respect him very much.

'And I simply love his face too. I did Lincoln make up on my own face several times to improve my skill.

'As I work on that make up, I learned about Lincoln a lot. I wanted to create his portrait for long time.'

Mr Tsuji decided to imitate Andy Warhol, who died aged 58 in 1967, because he saw parallels between the artist's life and his own.

And it's the same reason he chose to make a bust of Surrealist painter Salvador Dali.

He said: 'When I was watching a documentary on Warhol, the transition of my career from commercial artist to fine art artist struck me as similar to his.

'Both Lincoln and Warhol as well as Smith and Dali all broke through tormented life, childhood, insecurity or family issue, then they became the greatest.

'I am expressing their soul from inside of the sculpture while I create it layer by layer to the surface.'

He also found similarities between himself and Surrealist painter Salvador Dali, who died in 1989

Mr Tsuji has worked on blockbuster Hollywood films for 25 years, making prosthetics. 

These include aliens in sci-fi classic Men in Black and its sequel and also worked on the 2012 Total Recall remake with Colin Farrell.

He has mastered aging and worked with Joseph Gordon-Levitt in time-hopping thriller Looper - and he helped Brad Pitt travel through time in the Curious Case of Benjamin Button back in 2008.

After becoming frustrated with working in Hollywood, he turned his attention to fine art sculpture in 2008.

The self-taught make-up whiz made a bust of mentor Mr Smith, who was known as the 'Godfather of Make-up' in 2002, to honour his work in pioneering prosthetics.

Mr Smith, an Oscar-winning artist, worked on films including The Exorcist, The Godfather and made a youthful Dustin Hoffman look like a 121-year-old man in Little Big Man.
