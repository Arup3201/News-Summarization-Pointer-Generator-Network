An unlicenced cosmetic surgeon accused of performing a botched black-market cosmetic procedure that resulted in the death of a woman in Dallas has surrendered to the police.

Denise Rochelle 'Wewe' Ross, 43, was arrested on Wednesday for practicing medicine without a license. Her bond was set at $50,000.

Ross was booked into the Dallas County jail but online jail records Thursday show she has been released.

Warrants were issued for Ross and alleged accomplice Alicia 'Jimmy Joe' Clarke, 31, after the body of Wykesha Reid, 34, was found on a massage table at the Deep Ellum salon on February 19.

Reid was found with her pants partially pulled down and a blood-stained gauze on her butt. 

Patricia Kelley, 70, who had raised Reid since she was a baby, said the victim had always 'wanted a big booty.'

The nursing home staffer had already gone to the salon three times for the injections without experiencing any problems before she decided to go back a fourth time.

'Your butt's getting too big,' Kelley recalled telling her.

'But she got hooked on them booty shots,' she told the Dallas News.

Reid's fourth visit took place on February 18 and police found her body inside the business at 7am the next morning.

The building had been cleaned out and her purse and cellphone were missing.

Police believe the victim suffered a medical emergency while having injections in her buttocks.

Reid's body was found by Clarke at 7.50 a.m. and the dead woman's daughter, Keira, told police that her mother had booked a session to have 'butt injections' and that a woman who goes by the name of 'WeWe' and a transgender person were going to carry out the procedure.

Clarke told police that she had no idea how Reid had died. She claims that Reid arrived at the business on February 18 complaining that she 'was not well and wanted to lay down', so she locked her in the building overnight and discovered her body when she returned in the morning.

The Dallas County Medical Examiner's Office reported that it found injection marks and a silicone-type substance on Reid's buttocks, according to Wfaa.com.

Reid's family are calling for the pair to be brought to justice.

'I want to see them on trial for murder,' said Keaira Reid, 20. 'I'm very mad because anybody could have called 911.'

The death follows a complaint to police by a 27-year-old woman who said that she visited the salon on February 9 and paid $520 to have buttock injections, but ended up screaming in agony when 'unknown' substances were used on her.

The holes were then closed with superglue, she said. She later identified Ross and Clarke as the people who carried out the operation. Neither is registered with the Texas Medical Board.

Dallas County court records show Clarke has convictions for prostitution, lewd public conduct and possession of cocaine. 

Ross has previous convictions for aggravated robbery with a deadly weapon, assault, possession of drugs and theft.
