Life lost: Police in Denver shot and killed a 17-year-old girl identified by her friends as Jessica Hernandez early Monday morning

A deadly shooting of a 17-year-old girl at the hands of Denver police officers sparked angry protests in the city Tuesday, with members of the community demanding answers about the fatal encounter.

Police shot the teenager early Monday morning after they say she struck and injured an officer with a stolen car. Authorities did not release the girl's name, but friends identified her as Jessica Hernandez.

'We're angry about it. It's another life taken by another cop,' said 19-year-old Cynthia Valdez, a close friend and schoolmate of the girl. 'She was trying to find her talent. She wanted to find out what she wanted to be. ... Who knows what she could have been?'

Few details were immediately released after the shooting in an alley in the older, middle-class residential neighborhood. The four other people - three girls and a boy - in the car were not injured by the gunfire, and all were being questioned as part of the investigation, police said. 

It was not clear whether any had been arrested.

Police Chief Robert White said an officer was called to check on a suspicious vehicle at around 6.30am Monday in the Park Hill section of Denver and a colleague arrived after it was determined the car had been reported stolen.

In a statement, police said the two officers then 'approached the vehicle on foot when the driver drove the car into one of the officers.'

White said both officers then opened fire. The officer hit by the car was taken to a hospital with a leg injury.

Bobbie Diaz, whose 17-year-old daughter was in the car, said she was lying in bed when she heard four gunshots followed by an officer yelling, 'Freeze! Get out of the car! Get down!'

Diaz said she came outside to see officers with their guns drawn pulling people out of the car, including Jessica.

'She seemed like she was not responding, not moving,' she said. 'They just yanked her out and handcuffed her.'

Meanwhile, Diaz said she heard another person screaming, 'She's dead! She's dead!'

'I'm just trying to process everything. I'm just heartbroken for the girl's family,' Diaz said. 'How could something like this happen again?'

Another woman, Arellia Hammock, who has lived in the neighborhood for about a decade, said she heard three gunshots about 6.30am and then saw several police cars streaming down the street.

Hammock said she understands one of the officers was injured, but 'that's still no reason to shoot.'

'They shouldn't have stolen a car. But the cops are too fast on the gun,' she said. 'You've got stun guns. You've got rubber bullets. Why do they have to shoot all the time?'

That sentiment was echoed during Monday's vigil as some held signs decrying police brutality.

Jessica's friend Cynthia Valdez, 19, said the 17-year-old was trying to find her talent

Speaking out: Protesters wave placards as activists head into a meeting on Tuesday with officials from the office of the Denver District Attorney about the fatal shooting 

One of the signs read, 'Girls' Lives Matter,' a play on the 'Black Lives Matter' slogan that became a rallying cry after the police killings of unarmed black men in Ferguson, Missouri and New York City.

'It should have been handled differently. She's a young girl. I'm just not OK with it,' said 17-year-old Destiny Moya, who grew up with Jessica.

Both officers involved in the shooting have been placed on administrative leave pending the investigation, which was being conducted by police, the district attorney and the Office of the Independent Monitor, a civilian oversight agency for the city.

Earlier today, prosecutors promised a thorough investigation and asked angry protesters gathered outside District Attorney Mitch Morrissey's office for patience. 

Morrissey wasn't there during the tense confrontation at his office, where chief deputy district attorneys Doug Jackson and Lamar Sims spoke over shouts and obscenities from some of the protesters.

Jackson said he could not discuss the facts of the case but assured the group that the findings of the investigation will be made public when it's finished.

'You can decide whether we made the right decision or not,' Jackson said.

The girl's cousin, Jose Castaneda, said he was frustrated and didn't want to wait months to find out what happened.

'Let me ask you one question, how would you feel if it was your kid?' he yelled before storming away.

Protesters said they don't trust Morrissey's office to handle the case because the last time a Denver police officer faced charges in a shooting was 1992.

'We are sick and tired of these kinds of things happening and there seems to be no true objective investigation,' said the Rev. Patrick Demmer of the Greater Metro Denver Ministerial Alliance.

A shrine of red and white flowers and candles, and a grinning white teddy bear marked the shooting scene Tuesday.

Magaly Castaneda, 17, a friend of Hernandez, visited the site and said she doubted Hernandez would have intentionally hit an officer.

Those who knew Jessica (pictured left and right) said she had a lot of heart and expressed doubt that she had struck the officer on purpose with the car 

'She didn't even get time to think that she was going to get shot,' Castaneda said.

She had known Hernandez since both were middle school students doing each other's hair and makeup. Castaneda said Hernandez would bring home friends who had nowhere else to go, sometimes exasperating her mother.

'She always had a heart. She always cared about everyone,' Castaneda said.

By law, police are allowed to use force to stop and overcome the resistance of another person. They can use it to match the force and overcome it.
