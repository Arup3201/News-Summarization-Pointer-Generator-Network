A Ukip Euro MP was branded ‘crass, ignorant and insensitive’ yesterday after he joked about encouraging jihadists to blow up a building that spoils his view.

Steven Woolfe said that if ISIS terrorists ever came to the picturesque city of Chester he would ask them to destroy a newly-built NHS centre near his home.

The 46-year-old, who was elected an MEP for North West England in May, told a local newspaper: ‘If you had Ukip policy on planning it would never have got through.

‘My view of the lovely cathedral, one of the most beautiful buildings in England, is now blocked. As a joke, if ISIS came in I would be saying that’s the first building you can get, please. Just move it so I can have my vision back.’

The extreme Islamist group ISIS has been engaged in a series of horrific massacres across Iraq and Syria since early 2013.

Bob Thompson, the Lib Dem’s parliamentary candidate in Chester, said the comment spoke volumes about the character of Ukip. He added: ‘At a time of serious terrorist activity in various parts of the world ... Ukip inviting a terrorist organisation like ISIS to destroy a building in our city is crass, ignorant and insensitive.’

Mr Woolfe, a former barrister who is the party’s Migration and Financial Affairs spokesman, later apologised, saying: ‘The devastating and worrying violence in the Middle East is something I am well aware of and which I have commented on on many occasions. The issues and death are no laughing matter.

‘The joke was to identify an ugly building in Chester which has altered the beautiful historical views and surrounding architectural context.’

Mr Woolfe, 46, said: ‘I simply used hyperbole which is a common method in northern comedy.

'I didn’t think for a moment this would be regarded as something I actually wished for or advocated. In future I shall be more circumspect and just stick to professional language.’

However, agreeing with him about the NHS building, Mr Thompson said it was a ‘poor design which does no favours for our city.’

The building is described as a super-surgery which will amalgamate a number of GP surgeries in the area, something which has angered residents.
