She won our hearts as Bridget Jones, by committing the unthinkable in Hollywood and gaining enough weight to be both apple-cheeked and pear-shaped.

So you can understand why so many fans have expressed dismay at Renee Zellweger’s latest look. This weekend the actress – now size 6 – appeared at a fashion event in New York showing off chiselled cheekbones, a heavy brow and a peculiarly smooth forehead.

She was almost unrecognisable from the granny-pant-wearing Bridget. So what’s happened?

Although her management decline to comment, one Twitter commentator remarked that she looked like she’d been ‘hit with a shovel of Botox’.

Suspicions about surgical intervention notwithstanding, Renee is looking positively radiant these days.

And that’s largely down to a huge change in her lifestyle. The 44-year-old has walked away from her acting career, favouring instead a stint as a director and producer, which has done wonders for her stress levels and love life.

Renee has hinted that she felt close 
to a breakdown during her years on the A list, during which she suffered
 the humiliation of a 128-day marriage to country star Kenny Chesney in 
2005.

Chesney has since said that he 'panicked' after their impulsive ceremony in the Virgin Islands.

Renee later remarked: ‘I made the biggest mistake of my personal life. I felt a failure. I was looking for something else.

‘I just needed to put acting aside. I needed to sit still and not to worry about the dresses and the hair and the travel and the interviews. I was going through huge life changes at the time. I wanted to stop and be a girl for a while.’

After the Chesney disaster there was a heavy – if unlikely – flirtation with Sir Paul McCartney, in 2007 plus a liaison with celebrity hotelier Andre Balazs, and another with comedian John Krasinski, her co-star in Leatherheads.

Her 30s and early 40s passed from one short romance to another, with actor Bradley Cooper and rockstar Jack White of the White Stripes among her beaus. The parallels to Bridget Jones were often remarked on, a comparison which enraged and appalled Renee: ‘I’m not single, I’m busy,’ she told an interviewer, who enquired after her love life, before grimacing sardonically, ‘That’s my line.’

And now? Well, very quietly, Renee has found a new man. And at the relatively advanced age of 44, she believes that she has finally found ‘The One’.

The man in question is tall, dark and handsome blues guitarist Doyle Bramhall, with whom she was at university in Austin, Texas.

It is an unlikely match. While  Renee is clean living, Bramhall is an ex-heroin addict who once confessed: ‘I thought it was cool to be a tough drinker and drug addict.

‘From my experience, I think it is hereditary, and I think it gets worse every generation, especially alcoholism.

‘I work constantly on my personal life and go to therapy and AA meetings.’

His ex-wife is the musician Susannah Melvoin, a member of Prince’s entourage in the Nineties, with whom he has two daughters.

Bramhall and Renee started dating almost a year ago, and were spotted on a romantic holiday in Hawaii together in February.

So what’s the attraction?

‘Renee has always had a thing about musicians,’ a friend tells me, ‘and she thinks that this was fated to be, for them to find each other again after all these years.’

Recent reports suggest that the pair are contemplating adopting a child. A friend told the website RadarOnline: ‘She knows that she probably missed the boat on carrying and giving birth to a child.

‘Renee tries to find the positive side of things, she knows 44 isn’t too old to be a mum. It will just have to happen a little differently than she always imagined it would.’

In the immediate future, Renee will appear in one more film, 4½ Minutes.

It’s a comedy about a single mother who turns to a stand-up comedian to help her raise her genius child. She will direct and produce the film, and has spent several years raising the finance and working on the script.

As for Bridget, it looks like she has finally laid the character to rest: while the film company Working Title did produce a script for Bridget Jones III, which preceded Helen Fielding’s new Bridget Jones book Mad About The Boy, the project was shelved.

There is also talk that she  has fallen out with Fielding, who noticeably failed to thank Renee in the foreword of Mad About The Boy.

Will her next project be starting a family with her guitarist beau? It sounds very much as if it will.
