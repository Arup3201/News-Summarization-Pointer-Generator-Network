When most of us make a spelling misteak, er, mistake, at work a quick tap on the delete button usually does the trick.

But that option clearly wasn’t available to road markers in Carlisle whose KEEP CEEAR error at the civic centre was gleefully reported by drivers.

Contractors have corrected the mistake, which appeared last week, free of charge, and Cumbria County Council has apologised.

Councillor Willie Whalen said: 
'Anybody can make a mistake. I think it is a genuine mistake, it doesn’t
 look to be anything else. It really shows how hard the lads are 
working.'

Cyril Weber, chairman of the council’s
 Carlisle local committee, said: 'It’s just a basic human error.' He 
added: 'I am sure most people would be aware of what it means, in spite 
of the spelling.

Meanwhile in York, gas workers have 
dug up road bricks with double yellow lines on before placing them back 
into the road in different positions - making one of the lines barely 
recognisable.

The double yellow lines in now look 
more like a scene from classic computer puzzle game Tetris after the 
Northern Gas workers finished their handiwork last Friday.

And until the surface was put back to normal yesterday, drivers were left unsure of the parking restrictions.

Road markings on a York street ended up looking more like a game of Tetris than double yellow lines after builders bodged the job of relaying the bricks

One of the world's most popular computer games, Tetris first appeared in 1984.

It was created by Russian programmer Alexy Pajitnov while was studying computer science in Moscow.

The catchy theme tune was based on a 19th century Russian folk song called 'Korobeiniki', before it was arranged by Hirokazu Tanaka - also behind the music in Super Mario Land.

It is notoriously addictive - and a condition called the Tetris Effect was named after the game to explain when people spend so much time doing something that it begins to pattern their thoughts and dreams.

Tetris was said to have got its name from the 'tetra' prefix in 'tetramino' - a geometric shape made of four squares, connected at right angles to each other - and 'tennis', Mr Pajitnov's favourite sport.

One passerby, speaking before the 
bricks had been fixed, said: 'It looks as if someone has left a trail of
 scrambled egg down the street.

'I can't see how they can enforce the parking restrictions until they get some new double yellow lines painted.'

Another
 bystander, also speaking before the works were complete, said: 'They 
could get the contractors to rearrange all the bricks, but I think that 
might be rather expensive and I doubt they could figure it out.

'It's
 probably far easier for the council to paint some new double yellows. 
It shouldn't take them long, after all they've had enough practice.

'They'd better hurry up though. This 
is not a very wide road and if a couple of drivers decide to take 
advantage it could cause traffic chaos.'

A City of York Council spokesman said 
that the works had been completed four and a half weeks ahead of 
schedule by Northern Gas.

Although parking restrictions in the area 
remained in force throughout, no-one received a ticket over the weekend.

And Northern Gas said that the jumbled surface, which have now been fixed, were all part of a plan to ensure a 
professional and even finish.

A
 spokesman for the firm, which is 
currently upgrading 0.75 miles of metal gas mains in York city centre, said the lines were fixed yesterday so as not to cause disruption during
 the busy weekend - and the existing yellow marks were burned off before yellow lines were repainted.
