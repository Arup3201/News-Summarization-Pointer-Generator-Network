The Arsenal squad seemed to be in high spirits during training on Monday morning as they prepare for their Champions League qualifying clash against Besiktas on Tuesday.

Several of the Arsenal stars started play-fighting and Jack Wilshere seemed to bear the brunt as he was wrestled by team-mates including Olivier Giroud and Calum Chambers.

Arsene Wenger will hold a press conference on Monday afternoon after the squad travel to Turkey for the first leg in Istanbul.

Ahead of the game, Wenger admitted that Arsenal are 'desperate' to qualify for the lucrative group stages of the Champions League - and challenged his side to beat Besiktas 'no matter what it costs'.

The Gunners will fly to Turkey on the back of a dramatic stoppage-time 2-1 win over Crystal Palace on the first day of the new Barclays Premier League season.

There is, however, little opportunity for Wenger's squad to regroup before focus turns to extending the record of reaching Europe's elite club competition for each of the last 16 campaigns.

Qualification would bring with it some €8.6 million (£7million) in prize money, with each subsequent group home match worth around £3m of additional matchday revenue.

Wenger knows all too well what is on the line against Slaven Bilic's side, who defeated Feyenoord 5-2 on aggregate in the third round of qualifying thanks to former Chelsea striker Demba Ba's hat-trick in the second leg.

'We are desperate to do it because we want to play in the Champions League and we know how big these games are,' said Wenger.

'We are desperate to go through. No matter what it costs we want to go through.

'We always have a difficult draw, we had Fenerbahce last year, this time we have Besiktas, so it is difficult.'

Incentive: Qualification would bring with it some €8.6million (£7million) in prize money for Arsenal
