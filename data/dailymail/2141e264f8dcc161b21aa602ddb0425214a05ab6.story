Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich is reportedly buying up a neighboring properties in New York City so he build a mega-mansion.

The oil tycoon, who is worth more than $9billion, is said to have bought two of three townhouses in Manhattan's Upper East Side to merge into one home for him, socialite girlfriend Dasha Zhukova and their two children.

According to the New York Post, the 48-year-old secretly purchased 11 East 75th Street - a 21-foot-wide, 9,495-square-foot town house - for $29.7 million in October from developer Larry Gluck.

Two months later, he then reportedly bought the property two doors, number 15, down for just shy of $19million. 

A source told The Post he is now in talks with the owners of the house sitting in between. They are believed to be in contract to sell to a Russian 'mystery buyer'. 

Mark and Lori Fife are believed to have bought the home in 2000 for $7.4million, but now it is estimated to be worth more than $20million. 

If Abramovich is successful in his bid, he will add to his already huge empire of luxury properties he owns around the world.   

In 2011, billionaire Abramovich, who owns Chelsea soccer club, bought a $136million mansion on the country’s most expensive street, a stone’s throw from Kensington Palace in London.

His home in Kensington Palace Gardens, west London – known as Billionaires Row – has more than 15 bedrooms and extensive gardens. 

In October 2013, Page Six reported that he was close to buy three units in the Berwind mansion at 828 Fifth Avenue in New York. 

However the widow who owned the property turned him down, believing she could get more money for it.

If Abramovich is successful in his bid, the property (circled)  will be one of the biggest in Manhattan 

Family: He is looking to merge the properties together to make a home for him, his socialite girlfriend Dasha Zhukova (pictured) and their two children.
