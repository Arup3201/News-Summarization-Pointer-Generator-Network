British man Robert Fairchild was found by police and rescue teams after spending nearly two days lost in West Australian bush after attending a festival.

The 21-year-old man was found by police on Tuesday at 11am, two kilometres from where he was seen last seen in scrub between Yarra Road and the Brookton Highway in Flynn, about 75 kilometres south east of Perth.

'We found him walking towards a camp site,' Inspector Tony Colfer of Wheatbelt District Office in Northam confirmed.

'He was very disorientated and dehydrated and had to be conveyed by helicopter to the Royal Perth Hospital. He will be there overnight for observation,' he told MailOnline.

'He was able to speak but hasn't spoken about what happened - our concern was his safety and that was our main priority.'

Insp Colfer said the man was exposed to rain and harsh climate during the time he was missing.

Having lived in Perth for the 'last few years' Insp Colfer said the man's family in the UK had been notified of the disappearance and subsequently him being found.

A Western Australia police media spokeswoman confirmed the man had been living in Bayswater, north east of Perth CBD.

Insp Colfer said Mirrabooka police station was contacted late on Sunday night by a friend who reported Mr Fairchild's disappearance.

'As a result of that a missing person was filed,' he said.

Police conducted a search of the area where the man was last seen that night but were unable to locate him, Insp Colfer said.

On Monday morning an extended land search resumed, which continued on Tuesday, when the man was found.

Insp Colfer said the joint venture to find Mr Fairchild involved police, SES personnel, the Department of Park and Wildlife rangers as well as air support, mounted police and a dog squad.

'All up there were about 30 police officers and 80 SES personnel,' he said.

'Middle of nowhere': The 22-year-old went missing in bush about 75 kilometres south east of Perth and close to the Mundering State Forest

'It was a large-scale search so it was very important to work together to achieve a positive outcome,' he said.

During the search, Insp Colfer said vacant bushland of a scruby, rocky and hilly nature was scoured.Â 

'There's not a lot of properties out there, so it's pretty well isolated - it's out in the middle of nowhere,' he said.

Insp Colfer pinpointed the specific area Mr Fairchild was found in as seven kilometres north along Yarra Road and three kilometres east, near a campsite close to where the bush festival took place and in the area of the Mundaring State Forest.
