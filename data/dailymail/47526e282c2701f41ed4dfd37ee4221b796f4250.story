A Michigan couple have managed to smuggle their newly adopted daughter out of Crimea just after Russia officially annexed the state.

Kristine Proctor was waiting for the final pieces of paperwork to be filed for her and husband James's adoption of a 16-year-old orphan called Yana when Russian troops flooded the streets and a referendum decided that Crimea would become a part of Russia.

Although the official unification wasn't immediate, bureaucrats stopped issuing the documents the Proctors needed to remove Yana, who has since renamed herself Melissa, from her orphanage and the region.

Reunited: Kristine and James Proctor with their newly adopted daughter Melissa

With James Proctor returned to work in the United States, Kristine Proctor enlisted the help of Inna, a Ukrainian woman, to help her and Melissa escape the area.

'It was terrifying,' Kristine Proctor told ABC News on Friday, just hours before flying home to Michigan. 'We've had a lot of miracles.'

As pro-Russian crowds marched, denouncing the Ukraine's Western supporters, Kristine Proctor became increasingly frantic.

Inna finally managed to procure a tax identification number for Melissa, after one refusal after another from bureaucrats unwilling to issue a passport for the orphan.

Uncertain future: The Proctors met Melissa when she was almost 16 - the age at which she would have aged out of the Ukrainian orphanage system and been left to fend for herself

Adoptive parents: James and Kristine Proctor have adopted children from the Ukraine before

The document enabled them to buy a 
rail ticket to Kiev and the three boarded the train just hours before 
Russia completed its annexation of Crimea.

As they approached the border, armed soldiers boarded the car, asking the conductor if there were any foreigners aboard.

He indicated Melissa and Kristine were Americans.

The soldiers, miraculously, asked no further questions and the train continued on its way to Kiev.

'When
 the train came into the station [in Kiev], Inna and I looked at each 
other and started crying,' Proctor said. 'We were in survival mode and 
it all hits you.'

The
 Proctors, who have adopted several other children from the area in the 
past, met Melissa in December, when she was just short of her 16th 
birthday - the age at which she would age out of Ukraine's orphanage 
system and be left to fend for herself.

New daughter: The Proctors say Melissa is bright and confident and believe she will thrive in the United States

The connection was instant and the couple felt sure the 'smart, fun' teen would thrive in their family.

However, their battle wasn't over once Kristine and Melissa reached Kiev, as officials demanded she be returned to Crimea and refused to issue a passport.

Finally, after days of bureaucratic back and forth, Melissa was granted a passport and flew to her new home with her new mother on Saturday. Â 

ABC News reports that other adoptions that were in progress in Crimea have been halted. According to advocates, it's unlikely Russia will allow any adoptions by Americans to proceed.
