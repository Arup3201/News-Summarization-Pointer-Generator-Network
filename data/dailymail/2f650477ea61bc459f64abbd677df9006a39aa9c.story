Mandarin Chinese is the world's most spoken language, so it's no wonder  more and more people want to learn how to read, write and speak it.

And if you want to learn the basics without paying for an expensive course there are now a host of apps that can teach you for free.

And many, such as London-based Memrise, turn this learning into a game to make it fun, while also improving how much the brain takes in and recalls.

Memrise, along with rivals Skritter and ChineseSkill, all feature interactive tools that entertain as well as teach - a trend known as 'gamification.' Users commit Chinese characters and definitions to memory with the help of animations and mnemonics. For example, the symbol for 'cow' resembles a cow and neck yoke (pictured)

Memrise, along with rivals Skritter and ChineseSkill, all feature interactive tools that entertain as well as teach - a trend known as 'gamification' - pioneered by large education apps such as DuoLingo.

'We want to be a very popular game and we want people to play when they're bored,' Gina Gotthilf from DuoLingo added.

With Memrise, users commit Chinese characters and definitions to memory with the help of animations and mnemonics.

For example, the symbol for 'cow' resembles a cow carrying a neck yoke. And 'noodles' look like a bowl of noodles being eaten with chopsticks. 

Users are notified to review the characters periodically - a technique known as 'spaced repetition'. 

The firm compares the learning process to 'growing a garden of memory', with the premise being that when users learn words, they plant virtual seeds, which 'grow and bloom the more they review and practise.' 

Memrise also offers a range of other language courses, as well as courses about art, history, chemistry, politics, and more.  

DuoLingo does not currently offer a Chinese course, however. 

'In a lot of Western countries we now see ourselves as competitive with Candy Crush', said Ben Whately, who worked on Memrise's Chinese courses.

'Candy Crush is effective because it adjusts the difficulty level to just the right level for you.

'Adapting to a level where people feel clever is a great way to keep them playing.

'That is exactly what our learning algorithm does: adjusts when you are tested so that you always have to struggle a little bit, but you are generally successful.'

'Within a couple of hours of study you can read most of a Chinese menu,' said Mr Whately. 

'Every time you go to a Chinese restaurant or walk through China town, you re-engage with that.'

A lesser-considered obstacle in Chinese learning is learning to write characters correctly, a time-consuming technique that enhances a person's ability to remember them. Skritter (pictured) instructs users on the order and direction of strokes with bright graphics and feedback that flashes when they miss.

The learning technique builds on those used by games, such as Candy Crush (pictured), in which each level gets progressively more difficult

Another app, called ChineseSkill, uses the  video game tactic of 'unlocking' levels only when you answer enough multiple choice answers correctly, bringing users back to beat their own memory.

A lesser-considered obstacle in Chinese learning is learning to write characters correctly, a time-consuming technique that greatly enhances a person's ability to remember them.

App Skritter instructs users on the order and direction of strokes with bright graphics and feedback that flashes when they miss.

'The only way to quickly learn lots of characters is to write them 20 to 30 times,' said Hong Kong-based businessman Brad Jester.

'I started by doing this on paper, but Skritter is better because it replays them for you in a better timed sequence.' 

A key question is whether these methods work any better than traditional immersion in a native-speaking environment or a traditional classroom.

Mr Jester, now a fluent speaker, added: 'People sometimes think they can take the easy route of using flashcards and dictionaries to learn Chinese but that is 100 per cent not the case.

'Until these apps shame you into studying harder, they will just be helpful tools that reinforce lessons learned,' he said.

But, linguistics expert Dr. Peter Crosthwaite of the University of Hong Kong believes such apps may facilitate memorisation - an important aspect of language learning - but cannot offer the holistic approach a good teacher would deliver.

'Due to the continued growth and expansion of China's economy, more people than ever are wishing to learn Chinese,' Dr Crosthwaite said.

However, 'there are very, very few examples of the internet being used to teach someone a language from a beginner to advanced level of proficiency,' he cautioned.
