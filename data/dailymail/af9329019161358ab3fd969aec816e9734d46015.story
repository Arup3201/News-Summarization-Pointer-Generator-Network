Stunning X-Men star Famke Janssen claims the secret of her ageless looks is never drinking water out of plastic bottles.

Many people fear chemicals  can ‘leak’ into the water, causing  a toxic build-up in the body, but there is no scientific proof of that.

Now the 48-year-old Dutch actress has revealed her fitness regime. She also hits the gym regularly, has been seen shading herself from the sun with a parasol while strolling in New York and follows a strict vegan diet.

Healthy living: Famke, pictured in X-Men, does not eat meat, avoids dairy and tries not to drink water out of plastic bottles 

Famke, who plays Olivia Godfrey in Netflix’s supernatural drama Hemlock Grove, says: ‘I drink a lot of water, but try not to drink out of plastic bottles. I work out whenever I can and I don’t eat meat or dairy.’

Famke says she quit eating  meat because of her affinity with animals – especially her dog Liquorice. She said: ‘When you  get that close to an animal, things change and it doesn’t seem to matter if it’s a dog or a chicken or a cow – they all have feelings and all have emotions.’

nMillions of British women are 
living with chronic incontinence because they are too embarrassed to 
seek medical help, according to new research. About three-quarters of  
five million British women who develop the condition after giving birth 
fail to contact their GP, despite it being easily treatable.

Many
 have never spoken to anyone – even their partner – about their problem,
 according to the poll of 2,000 mothers commisioned by Netmums, and 
carried out for the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy and the Royal 
College of Midwives.

Six
 in ten felt the subject was ‘taboo’ and 56 per cent said they were 
embarrassed. A further 16 per cent felt ashamed. Simple physiotherapy 
exercises can solve the problem with the pelvic floor – see

No clot: The Geko device delivers tiny electrical impulses to the back of the knee

NHS hospital patients are to be offered a drug-free way  to treat post-surgical blood clots, a condition that kills 25,000 Britons a year.

The Geko device is a thin, 6in strip that attaches to the leg and delivers tiny  electrical impulses to the  back of the knee. It was approved by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence this month.

Developed at Bart’s and the London NHS Trust, it has been designed to help those who are unable to take blood-clot dissolving drugs – the first-line treatment – due to other health problems.

The device stimulates the muscles in 
the leg and foot which then increase blood flow in the veins of the 
lower leg. This may help reduce the risk of blood clots forming.

Doctors have discovered a way to
 treat an uncommon – yet distressing – condition that makes patients 
belch up to 20 times a minute.

Supragastric
 belching is thought of affect thousands of Britons and is due to 
excessive swallowing, meaning air is taken into the oesophagus. 
Digestive problems such as  irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and chronic 
acid reflux – or heartburn – are also thought to increase risk of 
developing it.

High
 levels of anxiety have been found in patients, and it has been linked 
to stress. Some patients say it started with them deliberately belching 
to ease feelings of bloating or abdominal discomfort, but it then became
 a habit.

Now,
 German and Swedish experts have used a combination of the muscle 
relaxant baclofen, and pregabalin, an anticonvulsant used to treat 
seizures and anxiety, to control the problem.

The
 treatment resulted in a greater than 90 per cent drop in the rate of 
belching, and doctors believe the combination works by reducing 
sensitivity at the junction between the oesophagus and stomach.

Phobias may be best treated in the early morning. People who had therapy for fear of spiders at 8am had a greater reduction in symptoms than those treated at 6pm, in a study at Saarland University Hospitals, Germany.

The reason may be that natural levels of the stress hormone, cortisol, peak in the morning.

Specific phobias are among the most common anxiety disorders, affecting more than one in ten of the population, with fear of spiders one of the most common.

Exposure therapy, where patients are increasingly exposed to spiders, can help, but not everyone benefits.

Drugs have been used to boost the effects of the therapy, and one of the most effective is synthetic cortisol, with a Swiss study showing that those given it had double the reduction in symptoms seen in those prescribed a placebo.
