As 2014 draws to a stylish close, our favourite TV celebrities have been ranked according to their fashion choices. 

Emma Willis, Mario Falcone, Cheryl Fernandez-Versini - and even Keith Lemon - feature prominently in this year’s top 10 celebrities who generated the most fashion interest on social media, according to research.

Reality TV was at the forefront of women's fashion with Big Brother and The Voice host Emma Willis taking the style crown by generating more online interest in her outfits than any other female celebrity.

Trending: A new survey has revealed the most searched for TV celebrity outfits from this year.

The colourful Victoria Beckham skirt and Jonathan Saunders top that she wore for Celebrity Big Brother’s Launch in August created the biggest online buzz of the year.

Just behind her, TOWIE’s Sam Faiers and Geordie Shore’s Vicky Pattison took second and third place respectively. 

Long-term celebrity trendsetters such as Cheryl Fernandez-Versini and Holly Willoughby continue to hold our interest when it comes to their fashion choices; both women held a place in the top ten list. 

For the boys, reality TV once again demonstrated its power to engage. TOWIE’s Mario Falcone’s dapper fashion style received more interest than any other male celebrity in 2014.

Interestingly, more mature men dominated the top ten list with Gary Lineker, Phillip Schofield and Gary Barlow all making an appearance, effortlessly styling out the younger boys. 

Celebrity couples were also responsible for driving much of the fashion interest, with Mark Wright and Michelle Keegan leading the pack with his appearance on Strictly, her exit from Coronation Street and the launch of her Lipsy range resulting in lots of interest.

Another extremely popular couple were national treasures, Ant and Dec. The jungle presenting duo were consistently mentioned online throughout the year, as were Nicole Scherzinger and Lewis Hamilton.

As well as showing who topped the style lists, the results also revealed some of the biggest fashion faux pas of the year including Rio Ferdinand’s 'Easy Jet pilot' look - which he sported during his World Cup Final commentary - and Cheryl Fernandez-Fersini’s infamous 'Kermit dress'.

The survey also revealed that the most fashionable day of the year was August 24 when the MTV Video Music Awards took place in America, while the day that people are most likely to purchase clothes was a Thursday. 

A spokesman for Style On Screen, which commissioned the survey by analysing more than four million tweets referencing outfits that celebrities were wearing throughout the year, said: '2014 was a fabulous year for style and celebrity. From Cheryl to Mary Berry - our favourite TV stars have once again led the way in terms of fashion and style trends.

'The 2014 Style on Screen Fashion Barometer is the largest analysis of its kind ever undertaken. It gives us a snapshot of the British public’s buying habits as well as their loves, loathes and celebrity obsessions.'
