The demolition of an enormous smoke stack was supposed to be an Australian breakfast television event - until one protester refused to turn the other cheek.

Creating a farewell to remember the man, wearing only a white T-shirt and no pants, moved into the background of a live Channel Nine broadcast in Wollongong, south of Sydney.

As a news reporter quizzes locals, the man can be seen taking off his pants while facing the camera as a friend looks on and laughs.

Using one hand to cover his crotch, the brave streaker moves further into shot, behind reporter Mike Dalton as he interviews a resident Port Kembla resident about the stack.

On screen for less than 10 seconds, were captured and shared on Twitter.

Thousands of residents gathered to see the historic moment when the 198 metre stack was brought crashing down at about 11am.

The stack was built in 1965 and Ninemsn reported about 250 residents were evacuated as it was blown up, with a 500 metre explosion zone set up around the stack. It is seen falling in the video below.

Port Kembla Copper general manager Ian Wilson said 934 holes were drilled into the stack to hold explosives for the demolition.

'There are explosives to blow a wedge out of the base of the stack to knock out a part of the base,' he said.

'The stack falls in that direction. The top part can’t fall fast enough to keep up with the bottom, so it’s likely to split into two or three pieces. It will fall broadly to the north.'

The controversial demolition was three years in the planning and divided the community due to health concerns from toxic dust.

The Port Kembla Copper smelter closed in 2003. While the company wanted to make the site a tourist attraction, an application to demolish it was lodged in 2010.

When asbestos was discovered in 2011, the demolition was pushed back until this year.
