The apartment where Warriena Tagpuno Wright spent the last hours of her life lies just off the Gold Coast's most famous boulevard, Cavill Avenue, in Surfers Paradise.

The two-bedroom flat decorated in neutral tones, and marble and granite finishes has floor-to-ceiling windows looking out onto the balcony from which Ms Wright, 26, fell to her death at 2.20am on Friday, August 8.

Queensland police will allege Ms Wright and 28-year-old Gold Coast construction worker, Gable Tostee, were alone in the apartment on the night of her death.

Gable Tostee, 28, was arrested at his parents' home on Friday morning for the murder of Warriena Tagpuno Wright, 26

Warriena Tagpuno Wright died when she plunged 14 storeys to her death at Avalon Riverfront Apartments at Surfers Paradise in Queensland

Tostee was remanded in custody until October 10 for the murder of Ms Wright.

His lawyer, Michael Purcell, says Tostee maintains he is not guilty of the murder and will be applying for bail.

'My client maintains his innocence and we look forward to the provision of a brief of evidence so we can move on with the court process,' he said.

'I've got instructions to make an application to the Supreme Court for bail in the weeks to come.'

Tostee's family were not present in court.

Police will allege they have a compelling case against Tostee, including taped recordings of the interactions between him and Ms Wright around the time of her death.

Gold Coast regional crime squad commander, Detective Superintendent Dave Hutchinson, said there were two people in the apartment prior to Ms Wright's fall - 'Mr Tostee and Warriena'.

Ms Wright, a New Zealand bank worker, went to Mr Tostee's apartment after meeting him on the dating app Tinder near the end of a trip to the Gold Coast for a friend's wedding.

Tostee's apartment is in Avalon Riverfront Apartments, an ultra-modern 32-storey riverside block in the heart of Surfers Paradise.

The building lies between Cavill Avenue and the Nerang River, and is just a 500m walk from the night club and bar strip on Orchid Avenue frequented by Tostee.

Avalon's apartments feature views of the river, city skyline and ocean off the south-east Queensland coast. Residents have access to a gym and sauna, and the penthouse flat has a private roof garden.

Ms Wright would have entered the building through a sleek designer foyer and taken the lift to the 14th-floor flat, which is around 45m above street level.

Gable Tostee's unit features clean painted white walls, a marble bathroom with glass shower unit and a bathtub and plain grey-beige carpet throughout.

A glossy grey galley kitchen with composite marble bench tops looks onto the large living room, which has floor-to-ceiling windows along the balcony.

It was from this balcony, which looks out over Surfers Paradise and the Nerang River, that Ms Wright fell.

A passer-by found her body on the cement path below, which has now become a shrine to the young woman with flowers, notes and stuffed toys.

Neighbours have told police they heard three distinct screams 'and a bang' as Ms Wright fell to her death.

Tostee did not appear in Southport Magistrates Court on Saturday morning - the day after he was charged with the murder of Ms Wright - and Magistrate John Costanzo adjourned Tostee's matter until October 10.

In the week leading up to Tostee's arrest, detectives kept his flat as a crime scene during the week while they made extensive forensic examinations of the unit.

On Wednesday, police in a cherry picker were raised up the Avalon building to take forensic samples from the outside of the balcony and other apartments on the way down.

Days later, detectives arrested Tostee at his parents' Carrara home on the Gold Coast and took him to the Southport watchhouse, where he charged with the murder of Ms Wright - exactly a week after she plummeted to her death.

Ms Wright had travelled from her native New Zealand for a two-week holiday and attend a former work colleague's wedding.
