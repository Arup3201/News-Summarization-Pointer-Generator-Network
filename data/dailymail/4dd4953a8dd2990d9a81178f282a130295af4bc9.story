There are several ways to survive an avalanche - hold onto something and pray, 'swim' in the direction of the snow... or be a mountain goat.

That certainly helped these light-footed animals after they were faced with a wall of snow hurtling down a mountainside in the French Alps last week.

Incredible footage from a helicopter over Le Roc de la Peche near Pralognan-la-Vanoise shows nine chamois goats having to think fast as the avalanche heads towards them.

Herd? Herd what? The avalanche begins at Le Roc de la Peche near Pralognan-la-Vanoise

As five of the chamois goats hot-hoof it over the cascading snow to safety, the remaining four disappear under a white sheet, much to the dismay of the helicopter crew which recorded the footage

It's not looking good for the goat quartet...

Five make a dash for it while the others try to sit it out.

As the 'runners' nimbly hot-hoof it over the cascading snow to safety, the hapless four disappear under a white sheet, much to the dismay of the helicopter crew.

Their commentary is in French, but the sheer emotion in the voices as they cry 'Ay, ay, ay!' dispenses with the need for Google Translate.

And just when all seems lost, two, three, then all four buried goats emerge and rush off to join the rest of the group.

Battered, possibly; bruised, maybe. But alive.

In October, two climbers in the region suffered mild injuries while climbing the glacier du Génépy.

They were just below the summit ridge at 3,500 meters when they triggered a slab of snow.

But what's this? Two of the animals emerge from under the wall of snow!

Four! Amazingly, the 'Lazarus' goats live again and race to re-join the herd

Clear of danger, the nine are reunited, and they certainly have something to bleat about
