Two Al Qaeda terrorists who plotted to kill thousands of innocent people in bomb attacks in Britain are attempting to have their convictions quashed on human rights grounds.

Extremists Salahuddin Amin and Rangzieb Ahmed, both British citizens, claim their trials were unfair because UK spies knew some of the information used against them was obtained during their torture by Pakistani security services.

Their argument has previously been rejected by the UK courts.

The European Court of Human Rights, Strasbourg, where officials have allowed the terrorists' applications to go ahead

Omar Khyam, 25, was found guilty by a jury at the Old Bailey of conspiracy to cause explosions likely to endanger life

Now the pair have been given a green 
light to put their case to the European Court of Human Rights in a 
last-ditch bid to be freed.

If the case is not thrown out it will be the first time British terrorist convictions have been challenged in Strasbourg.

It has provoked outrage because the 
European Court would normally have declared the case inadmissible – as 
it does 400,000 each year – because the claim hinges on a point of fact,
 rather than one of law or procedure.

Lawyers have criticised the rising influence of unelected judges over British sovereignty.

Lord Carlile of Berriew, the 
Government's former independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, said:
 'To have the European Court of Human Rights intervening in judgments of
 fact – as opposed to judgments of law – really would be a new departure
 and, in my view, a completely unacceptable departure.'

If the Government fails to satisfy 
judges that MI5 was not complicit in the torture, a full hearing will be
 ordered which could force British courts to quash the convictions. The 
legal bill will also be footed by the British taxpayer.

Amin, 37, was jailed for life in 2007 
for his role in a plot to detonate a fertiliser bomb at Bluewater 
shopping centre in Kent, or at London's Ministry of Sound nightclub.

Documents claim his right to a fair 
trial was breached because information against him was 'obtained through
 the use of torture and inhuman and degrading treatment'.

Ahmed, 37, who was born in Rochdale, 
is the highest member of Al Qaeda to go on trial in Britain. Convicted 
of 'directing terrorism', he had links with the 7/7 and 21/7 bomb 
plotters.

Former shadow home secretary David Davis has demanded an inquiry as there is 'hard evidence' of torture in the men's cases.
