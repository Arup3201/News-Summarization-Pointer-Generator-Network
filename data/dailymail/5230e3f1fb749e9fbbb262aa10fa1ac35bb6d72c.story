A mommy blogger who has been charged with murdering her son appeared in a New York court on Thursday.

Lacey Spears of Chestnut Ridge, New York was in a courtroom almost a year after her son Garnett died from acute sodium poisoning.

Lacey has been accused of poisoning her son with salt, administering the fatal dose as the 5-year-old was receiving treatment in the hospital for hypernatremia - a condition that sees elevated salt levels in the blood.

Tragedy: Garnett Spears (above) died at just 5-years-old in January from acute sodium poisoning

Prosecutors revealed in court today that they would be bringing up a previous episode in which Garnett was suffering unusually high sodium levels, as well as some lies that Lacey may have told, calling her character into question.

The Journal News reports, 'attorneys said Garnett Spears suffered an earlier episode of high sodium levels at Children's Hospital in Alabama, presumably at the hands of his mother, Lacey Spears.'

They also intend to bring up claims that Lacey lied about being engaged to a man, who she claimed was Garnett's father, and claimed to have two other children who do not exist.

The trial is set to begin on January 26.

Lacey gained a national following online by writing about her son's numerous medical conditions. 

Not well: Lacey  is believed to suffer from Manchausen Syndrome by Proxy

Horrible end: It is thought that Lacey may have administered the fatal dose of salt to her son while he was being treated in the hospital 

Garnett died on January 23, 2013  at the Westchester Medical Center in Valhalla after his sodium levels rose to an extremely dangerous level with no medical explanation.

Lacey, 26, who documented her son's persistent illnesses online, has been charged with killing him by administering salt through a feeding tube in his stomach.

The mother, nicknamed the 'mommy blogger', is believed to have been suffering from Postpartum Depression and Manchausen Syndrome by Proxy.

The condition is a psychiatric disorder which makes a parent purposely hurt their child for attention.

When Garnett was only five weeks old, Spears 'verbalized she wanted to harm him', the report said.

Around a month later, she was referred to medical social services for 'interpersonal conflict, stress and dysfunction'. The document does not state what the outcome of the referral was.

Barry Spear, a spokesman for the Alabama Department of Human Resources, said he had no record of hypernatremia being reported to the authorities when Garnett was a baby. 

Spears, who shared her son's hospital room after he was brought in suffering from vomiting and seizures, pleaded not guilty in June to charges of depraved murder and first-degree manslaughter.

Depraved murder is a count often used in cases that suggest extreme recklessness rather than intentional killing.

It carries the same maximum sentence, however - 25 years to life.
