A mother stole from a disabled man as he lay unconscious on the floor of a supermarket after suffering from a seizure.

Sentencing magistrates labelled the woman who stole the £500 Sony Xperia mobile phone 'despicable'.

But despite blasting her behaviour, Emma Woods, 27, from Nelson Lancashire, walked free from court yesterday.

Emma Woods (L) stole from Andrew Moulding (R) as he lay unconscious in a supermarket in Colne, Lancashire. She then took his phone and glasses telling staff that she would return the belongings to his father's home

Burnley Magistrates heard that victim Andrew Moulding, 46, had been at his best friend’s funeral before the crime.

It was the first time the vulnerable father had left his house after an initial stroke eight months ago.

Mr Moulding described the theft, which happened as he had lay unconscious, as 'morbid'.

The court heard that after attending his friend's wake he went into his local Tesco in Colne, Lancashire to buy some food for his dog but while he was in the shop, he suffered another seizure.

Woods then took off Mr Moulding's glasses and stole the mobile phone from his pocket.

She told staff that she knew the victim’s family and would return his belongings.

Emma Woods walked free with a £400 but she was warned by magistrates that she could face a prison sentence if she committed any further offences

The court heard that Woods then took the glasses to Mr Moulding's father’s house but failed to tell him about the mobile phone.

After the callous robbery, Mr Moulding, a former joiner, was taken to the Royal Blackburn Hospital where he remained for two days.

It was only when he had started recovering from the stroke that he realised his mobile was missing.

Andrew Robinson, prosecuting, said that Mr Moulding had entered the shop at around 8pm on September 5 last year.

Mr Robinson said: 'His eyes began to blur and his next recollection was him waking up in Blackburn Hospital on a drip. 

'He 
was discharged on September 7 and queried where his glasses and mobile 
phone were and was told the property had been handed back to his father.

'Emma Woods had attended his [father's] home address and handed him his glasses but not the mobile.

Andrew Moulding said of Woods: 'She's picked on me whilst I was unconscious, it was very brazen of her. I could have been dead but even then I don¿t think that would have stopped her. I was literally on the floor'

'CCTV
 showed her in the store removing his glasses and mobile
 phone, looking at it and scrolling through it.

'She said she would 
return them to his father, that wasn’t done.'

In a 
victim impact statement read in court, Mr Moulding said: 'It was the 
first time in eight months I had been out, I am disabled after my first 
stroke and I was met with sickening behaviour.

'I
 can not believe it, I felt disgusted, violated and stripped of my 
dignity knowing someone had been going through my pockets when I was at 
my most vulnerable.

'She used my glasses as a front to keep my phone. I could have been dead on the floor, it wouldn’t have stopped her.'

He added that by taking his phone, she also took away sentimental photos, personal and important data, hospital appointments and music from him - all of which caused him 'unnecessary stress and inconvenience'.

He added: 'What gives her the right to go through my pockets? It is disgusting behaviour.'

Laura Heywood, who represented Woods in court said that the mother had been drinking and went to Tesco to buy some cigarettes.

Woods walked free from court yesterday. She was handed fines of £499

Miss Heywood said: 'She failed to return the phone, she can’t offer any explanation why she did that. She accepts responsibility for not returning the mobile phone.'

The court heard that Woods had been hauled before the courts in 2009  and had been sent to prison in 2010 for breaching a suspended sentence.

Chairman of the bench Jack Paley sentencing said: 'It was indeed a despicable act.

'We sentence you to 20 weeks, however we suspended it for 12 months so you are not going down the steps today, but you were very close.

'You are a very lucky lady.'

Woods has been handed a 12-month supervision period as well as a community order.

She will also be given help for her drinking which Mr Paley said would 'hopefully help you in the future and stop you re-offending'. She was also ordered to pay £499.

He added: 'The next 12 months if you do anything wrong I can guarantee you will not be walking out.'

Speaking after the case, Mr Moulding described Woods as 'scum of the earth'. He said: 'Eight months before this happened I had a stroke and hadn’t moved out of the house.

'I feel violated. She is a low life. You couldn’t get any lower than to steal from a man who was having a seizure.

'She’s picked on me whilst I was unconscious, it was very brazen of her. I could have been dead but even then I don’t think that would have stopped her. I was literally on the floor.

'She is shameless. She carried the theft out under bright lights and under CCTV...'
