Once named the most eligible girl in Britain by society bible Tatler, Lady Kitty Spencer's bachelorette days appear to be over, after going public with a new romance during a dinner at Lord's.

And the lucky man isn't just any old beau: he's Nick Compton, England cricket star, and heir to a dynasty almost as exceptional as Kitty's own.

Although this is the first time they have been seen together, the duo have been exchanging flirty Twitter messages since last September, with her teasing him for his obsession with his hair and laughingly calling him 'grandad' - a nod to the seven year age gap between them.

Public: The pair appeared happy and in love when they appeared at a cricketing awards dinner at Lord's

The niece of Diana, Princess of Wales, 22-year-old Kitty is the eldest daughter of Charles, Earl Spencer, from his first marriage to Victoria Lockwood.

She numbers Princes William and Harry among her cousins and is a close friend of Prince Harry's former girlfriend, Chelsy Davy.

Compton, meanwhile, is the grandson of Denis Compton, who played 78 times for England, and landed an FA Cup winner's medal with Arsenal in 1950.

One of England's top batsmen, Compton was named Cricketer of the Year by the Wisden Almanac - the cricket equivalent of Tatler - this year.

Kitty, who was on hand to see him win, gave him a huge hug as he went up to receive the award in recognition of a year in which he was England's leading run-scorer.

While Compton has been concentrating on his sporting career, Kitty has been studying for an MA in luxury brand management in London, and travelling back and forth to South Africa to visit her mother, who still lives in Cape Town.

Although Compton isn't quite as well bred as his new girlfriend, the pair do at least have South Africa in common: he was born there and remained in the country until he won a scholarship to Harrow.
