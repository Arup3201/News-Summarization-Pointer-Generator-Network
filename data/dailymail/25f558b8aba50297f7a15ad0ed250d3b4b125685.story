Britain looks to have missed out on its warmest ever Christmas Day by just 1.3C but the weather was still balmy enough to see Northern Ireland break its maximum temperature record.

An exceptionally mild Christmas Day has seen weather experts monitoring their equipment with the British record for Christmas Day under threat.

So far, the provisional measurements suggest that the 15.6C maximum - set in 1896 and repeated in 1920 - has not been exceeded.

A very near miss came in Churchfenton, where a provisional figure of 14.0C has been recorded, and the country enjoyed its third warmest Christmas Day ever.

While there could still be a British 
record today, the best window of opportunity has now passed with 
temperatures beginning to drop.

However, one record did fall today as Northern Ireland saw its warmest ever Christmas Day.

The mercury crept up to 14.3C in Murlough, breaking the record of 13.0C which was set in 1988.

And a year-on-year comparison makes 
for amazing readying, with the the same day last year offering a 
bone-chilling -17.5C in Katesbridge - a temperature swing of 30.5C in 
Northern Ireland on the big day. 

At Aberdeen airport in Scotland, a 
temperature of 14.8 was recorded, just 0.8C below the record of 14.8C, 
which has stood since 1896.

'It is a very different Christmas Day to last year,' said Met Office forecaster Michael Lawrence.

'This year Northern Ireland has seen 
its maximum temperature broken, while England, Wales and Scotland are 
all close to their maximum temperature, but it looks as it they are 
going to fall slightly short.

'It has been exceptionally mild in 
the north of the UK in particular, and temperatures generally have been 
around the 11 and 12 mark.' 

Forecasters had also predicted there 
would be severe winds today and they were not disappointed as gusts of 
136mph were recorded in Cairgorms, Scotland.

The warm weather had dashed hopes of a
White Christmas as the country woke up to gentle sunshine, with County 
Durham beginning with a brilliant scarlet and orange sunrise. Even 
Scottish mountain peaks have so far escaped snowfall.

Looking forward, football fans - and 
fans of good weather in general - can expect some holiday sport without 
the usual chill, as Boxing Day is also set to be a mild day.

'After Boxing Day temperatures will 
slowly start to fall back, returning to closer to what we'd expect at 
this time of year,' said Aisling Creevey, a forecaster with MeteoGroup, 
the Press Association's weather division.

Despite today's maximum temperature 
not tumbling, forecasters say that the coming days will remain some of 
the warmest for the time of year in more than a decade – milder than 
Athens and Barcelona.

It’s certainly very different from 
this time last year, when the country was in the grip of a big freeze 
and some areas recorded their coldest ever temperature.

Last year in Altnaharra, in the Scottish Highlands, the mercury plummeted to -18c.

Chris Bulmer, a forecaster for the Met Office said: ‘It’s a stark contrast to last year. This is due to a milder air mass.

'We’re likely to keep this general pattern through to the New Year and then there are likely to be some colder snaps.’

He added: ‘Last Christmas Day there were record minimum temperatures in Wales and Scotland.

‘After a short cooler interlude next 
midweek, the set-up which has brought the current milder conditions will
return, with south-westerly winds.’

It will continue a record-breaking year for the UK which has enjoyed its warmest spring for 350 years.

An average temperature of 10.32C or 
50.58f between March 1 and May 29 beats the previous record of 1893, 
when Queen Victoria was on the throne and William Gladstone was Prime 
Minister.

The record-breaking hot spell was 
measured in central England - the triangle of land between London, 
Manchester and Bristol - and beats all previous springs since 1659.

Can you believe it's October? People flocked to 
Brighton Beach as temperatures across the country soared, making 
it the hottest October for 26 years

And the country experienced a 
sweltering Indian summer, with October 1 declared as Britain’s as most 
scorching October day in more than a century.

Just four weeks before the clocks 
went back for winter, Britain was in the middle of an Indian summer like
no other with sizzling temperatures sweeping the country.

Meteorologists confirmed temperatures of 30c in Yorkshire with Gravesend, Kent not far behind reaching 29.9c.

The hottest day prior to October's blistering heat was June 27 when highs of 33.3c were set at the Olympic Park in London.

This festive family are set to be the only household in Britain to enjoy a white Christmas this year - after buying a snow machine for their front garden.

Builders Lee Brailsford, 34, and brother Paul, 31, decorated their mother's house with £10,000 worth of lights including a life-size nativity scene - then topped it off with a dusting of snow.

Their £150 machine can pump out dozens of litres of snow at the flick of a switch, coating their garden in Brentry, Bristol, in a wintry blanket in minutes.

Lee's sons Jordan, 13, and Liam, 11 and Paul's children Sienna, six, and Harrison, two, woke up to a white Christmas.
