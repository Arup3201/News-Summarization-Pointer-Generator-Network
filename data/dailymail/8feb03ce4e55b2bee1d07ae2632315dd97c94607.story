Arsenal take on Monaco at the Emirates stadium on Wednesday night, knowing they have their best chance for years to reach the Champions League quarter-finals.

But in their way are a team in form, with a strong defence and some dangerous players - and old foes - going forward.

Who's the boss? 

Portuguese manager Leonardo Jardim isn’t the best known manager left in the competition, but that won’t faze him. 

Despite being only 40, the Monaco boss already has 13 years of coaching experience behind him, joining AD Camacha as assistant manager in 2001 before moving into the top job two years later. 

Spells at Chaves, Beira-Mar and Braga led to a move to Greek side Olympiacos before he returned to Portugal to take charge of Sporting in 2013. He took over at Monaco last summer.

At 40 years old Leonardo Jardim is still young for a manager, but has plenty of experience in football

Joao Moutinho is Monaco's crucial playmaker and will try to dictate the game from the middle of the park

Who are the dangermen?

4 Monaco scored just four goals on their way to finishing top of Group C, accumulating 11 points.

2+ Arsenal have scored at least two goals in their last five Champions League matches.

5 Monaco have kept five clean sheets in their previous six matches in the Champions League.

Joao Moutinho will pull the strings in central midfield and Arsenal’s ball-winner Francis Coquelin will have to harry the Portugal international. 

Arsenal must also stop Monaco’s box-to-box midfielder Geoffrey Kondogbia. 

The Gunners should know about the France international, having scouted him extensively in recent seasons. 

Yannick Ferreira Carrasco has added pace and trickery to Monaco’s attack from the flanks. And then, of course, there’s Dimitar Berbatov...

Any familiar faces?

Having spent eight years gracing the Premier League with his poise, skill and swagger, all eyes will be on Berbatov.

Dimitar Berbatov will present a familiar threat as he seeks to prove he is still a top-level player

Moutinho and Geoffrey Kondogbia, who Arsenal have previously scouted, are the players to watch

The former Tottenham, Manchester United and Fulham man will want to prove he can still cut the mustard against England’s elite. 

Likewise, Moutinho is a name that’s become well known in English football in recent years — particularly during transfer windows. 

The Portuguese was constantly linked with Tottenham during the Andre Villas-Boas era.
