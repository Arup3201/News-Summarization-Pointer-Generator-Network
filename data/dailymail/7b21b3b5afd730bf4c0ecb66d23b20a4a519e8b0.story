Martin Odegaard, Norway’s youngest ever international is not signing for anyone before the end of Monday's transfer deadline day, according to sources very close to the 15-year-old.

Wanted: Manchester United were discussing possibility of signing Stromsgodset's Martin Odegaard

Record breaker: Odegaard became Norway's youngest ever player at the age of 15

Centre of attention: Odegaard burst on to the scene earlier this year and has attracted Europe's elite

Born: Norway, December 18, 1998 (age 15) 

Playing position: Attacking midfielder

2014-NOW: Stromsgodset (16 apps, 3 gls) 

2014-NOW: Norway (1, 0)

Odegaard burst on to the scene earlier this year has attracted the attention of Europe's elite.

Odegaard's father, Hans-Erik, told Sportsmail: 'We have feet on the ground but we know everything has taken off and there's so much attention on him. I've said to all the agents and the clubs that he is too young to go alone.

'I don't think it's good for any 15 or 16-year-old boy to move abroad to a different country with a different language, different culture, to be alone sitting in a flat, coming in late on February nights, hungry. You need a family to feel secure.

'So if that's going to happen soon, we move with him. And that's not easy because I have a job, working for my father-in-law's textile shops, and we have a family.' 

Selfie belief: Odegaard takes a picture before his international debut against the UAE

And Stromsgodset manager David Nielsen told Sportsmail: 'We cannot do anything. We're a small club in Norway. We've got a kid that everybody is after. If somebody comes to get him, he will leave. 

'It's pretty simple, really. But I still believe the best way for him to develop is by playing first team football and this is one of the only places he is going to play first team football. I think he's at the right place. For at least another year-and-a-half, maybe two years, he's at the right club.'

Odegaard made his international debut for Norway on August 27 in a friendly against United Arab Emirates at the age of 15 years and 253 days.

In doing so he broke a record that had stood for more than a century and almost marked his debut with a goal in a game that finished 0-0.  

England face Norway next Monday in a friendly at Wembley, but Odegaard has not made the cut.
