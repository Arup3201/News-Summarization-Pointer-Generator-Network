Former Radio 1 DJ Dave Lee Travis  yesterday became the fourth person to be arrested by police investigating allegations of sexual abuse following the Jimmy Savile scandal.

The 67-year-old was held during an early-morning raid at his £1million home in rural Buckinghamshire over allegations of sexual assault dating back to the late 1960s.

The arrest came as Scotland Yard said the number of potential victims of historic abuse linked to Savile had risen to 450.

TV chiefs had to pull a 1977 episode of Top Of The Pops featuring Travis that was due to be shown on BBC4 last night.

He is the fourth man to be arrested by police investigating hundreds of allegations made after Savile was outed as a predatory paedophile.

Former BBC producer Wilfred De’ath, 73, disgraced pop star Gary Glitter, 68, and comedian Freddie Starr, 69, remain on bail.

A fifth man, Savile’s former driver Ray Teret, 71, was questioned by officers in Manchester about child sex offences last week. His case is being treated separately.

A team of police officers arrived in a convoy of marked and unmarked cars at Travis’s home in the village of Mentmore at 7.45am yesterday. He was taken to Aylesbury police station where he was questioned for more than five hours by specialist officers.

Travis was driven home in a silver Audi at 9.20pm, after spending more than 12 hours in custody and being released on bail.

He declined to comment and his solicitor said he would not be making any statement.

Several claims have already been made that the DJ, who still has a weekend show at Magic AM, groped women colleagues in the 1970s and 1980s.

Television and radio broadcaster Vivien Creegor claimed he ‘jiggled her breasts’ while live on Radio 4 in the 1980s.

Mrs Creegor, 55, who went on to become a presenter on Sky News, claimed Travis clamped his hands over her jumper as she made a live announcement.

And an unnamed woman said he put his hand up her skirt in 1977 when she was 17 after inviting her into his studio to select the next music track.

The woman, who has not waived her right to anonymity, said a technical operator remarked afterwards: ‘I thought you were being a bit brave going in there.’

Police officers spent more than six-and-a-half hours searching his home before leaving without commenting to media.

A neighbour who went to lend support said Travis’s wife Marianne was ‘delirious’ with shock after police began searching her house.

He said: ‘She’s very upset, as you 
can imagine. It’s just the last thing you would want to wake up to. They
are a lovely couple and this has come as a complete shock.’

Travis, who hosted the Radio 1 
breakfast show from 1978 to 1980, has previously strenuously denied 
allegations of sexual assault.

He said claims he routinely touched 
women inappropriately were ‘utter b******s’, and angrily denied putting 
his hand up the 17-year-old’s skirt.

He added that ‘it was a different world in the 70s – all institutions were the same back then’.

Children’s charity the NSPCC said it 
had received 236 calls about Savile, an average of five per day, since 
the first sexual abuse allegations emerged.

The number of contacts made about other claims of sexual abuse has trebled in the past month, rising to 550.

A Met police spokesman said the 
allegations against Travis did not involve Savile directly. Magic AM 
declined to comment until the ‘full facts’ are known.

Dave Lee Travis was born David Patrick Griffin in Buxton, Derbyshire.

He grew up in Manchester and started his working life as a designer of shop interiors.

At night and on the weekends, he began working as a DJ at the Oasis Club.

Before long, he decided to pursue his nighttime hobby of DJing full time.

He gave up his other jobs to go on a self-created and promoted tour of clubs, ballrooms and theatres throughout the UK and America. 

When he returned, he did a stint at anti-establishment pirate radio station Radio Caroline on ships floating off the coasts of Essex and the Isle of Man.

He moved to the BBC in 1967 where he joined the newly-founded Radio 1.

The high point of his career came in 1978 when he took over the breakfast show from Noel Edmunds and re-branded himself to listeners as the Hairy Cornflake.

It was not long before he was considered something of a national treasure. 

He resigned on-air in 1993 during his Sunday morning show, saying he could not agree with changes being made to Radio 1. 

He went on the present the BBC World Service music request programme A Jolly Good Show.

And it was this show that Burmese pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi said had given her a lifeline during her captivity.

She said the show had made her ‘world much more complete' to which Travis responded that he was ‘touched but ‘not surprised’ that she had remembered it.
