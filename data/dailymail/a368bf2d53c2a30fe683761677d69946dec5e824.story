Stylish, sleek and impressive audio output - start-up company Root have created a worthy addition to the headphone market.

The two models tested were the DJPro, priced at £89.99 and the T1, coming in at £29.99.

At first glance, both have distinct styling clearly catering for very different audiences.

Sound investment: DJPros are built to last

The DJPro, as the name suggests, wouldn't look out of place hugging the ears of some of the world's top DJs.

Their chunky look is designed to catch the eye, while clever details like the coiled wire at the bottom, give the impression they could be slotted straight into a turntable.

Although their brushed-metal effect is heavy-looking, the DJ Pros are surprisingly light-weight.

They are easily adjustable, too, with comfortable, padded speakers that rest snugly on your head.

Audio quality is on par with their aesthetics. Depth of sound is strong and noise reduction is effective.

Purists may find the bass not quite 'deep' enough for headphones of this nature, but there's enough there for most to enjoy. Musical detail, in particular, is on par with headphones twice the price.

Moving on to the T1s. These have a very different feel to the DJPros - catering to a much wider audience.

And although the T1s may be the entry-level offering of Root headphones, there's nothing to suggest the company have let quality drop.

It's a simpler design than the DJPros, one more suited to compliment most outfits rather than be a statement piece.

Its looks are simple enough to be an attractive buy for teenagers and for younger children, while retaining a playful feel which will resonate with many adults.

Queen of cool: The T1s compliment most outfits and boast strong audio quality

Sound quality is strong, although it's slightly more 'tinny' than the DJPros. There's a slight lack of low-end punch in the bass, but trebles are crisp and clean, allowing clear instrument distinction.

For the price, very few that can match them.

Roots may be new to the audio market but are clearly in tune with what consumers want.

Whatever pair you go for, both are brilliant value for money and a sound investment for years to come.
