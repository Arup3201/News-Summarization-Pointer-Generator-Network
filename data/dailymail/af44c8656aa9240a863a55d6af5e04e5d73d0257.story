Held back: Graham Stuart said white working-class parents that their children are held back at school because the television is constantly on in their homes

A Conservative MP has told white working-class parents that their children are held back at school because the television is constantly on in their homes.

Graham Stuart said that youngsters from poorer families are being overtaken in school by pupils from ethnic minorities because these children worked harder.

The privately-educated MP for Beverley and Holderness in the East Riding of Yorkshire said parents should turn off their televisions, blaming a constant stream for stopping children from being able to concentrate on their homework.

Mr Stuart is chairman of the Commons education committee, is currently investigating the 'underachievement' of white working-class children, and the reasons behind this - including the impact of their homes and families, and what can be done to improve their educational outcomes.

The MP makes his own two children finish their homework before they are allowed to sit down in front of the TV.

'I am not trying to demonise people who leave the telly on if they do not know how damaging it is because no one tells them and [if] they do know know how important two hours' extra homework every fortnight is,' he said, according to the Sunday Times.

Mr Stuart added that poor white 
children are falling behind some pupils from ethnic minorities, and said
 that being able to do homework without the distraction of the 
television would help youngsters improve their grades.

He
 said that children from poor immigrant families, who live in 'dire' 
housing outperform some disadvantaged British children because they work harder.

However, Mr Stuart's remarks, made as he took evidence as part of the education committee's investigation, were criticised by fellow committee member Labour MP Chris Williamson.

The Labour MP for Derby North said that Mr Stuart's views on television demonstrated 'how cut off these privileged members of the Conservative party are'.

He added that the children's struggles were down to a lack of opportunity.
