Tommy Smith's 83rd-minute goal was enough to earn Ipswich the points in a closely-fought 1-0 win over Watford.

The two sides were evenly matched, both enjoying chances before the Town centre-back hammered in from close range after a well-worked free-kick from the home side.

Victory moved the Tractor Boys up to fourth in the Championship and above Watford, who lie one place and one point behind their conquerors.

Millwall defender Danny Shittu scored at either end as Brentford continued their  play-off push with a 3-2 victory over the Lions. 

Andre Grey scored either side of half-time to put the Bees 2-0 up, before Shittu and Alan Dunne scored twice in two minutes just before the hour mark to draw Millwall level. And Shittu then found just a few minutes later to give Brentford the win.

Leeds arrested an eight-game winless run and Neil Redfearn tasted his first victory as permanent head coach as Blackpool were beaten 3-1 at Elland Road.

United had not picked up three points since Redfearn’s successful caretaker spell in September, with the subsequent poor form under Darko Milanic leading to the former academy director getting the job full-time last week.

His first two games yielded a point but the slump was halted against the league’s bottom side, with Liam Cooper, Souleymane Doukara and Mirco Antenucci all doing the damage by half-time.

Fulham climbed out of the bottom three with a 3-1 victory over Huddersfield as they continued their revival under Kit Symons.

The Cottagers manager, who was handed the full-time job last week, saw goals from Hugo Rodallega, Lasse Vigen Christensen and Ross McCormack see off the Terriers.

Striker Rudy Gestede continued his hot goalscoring form with his 10th of the season to give Blackburn a 1-1 draw at Brighton and extend their unbeaten run to seven games.

Gestede`s tremendous header early into the second half cancelled out Gary Gardner`s second goal in successive matches just before the interval.

A resilient defensive display helped Charlton end their run of three Championship matches without a win when they defeated Reading 1-0 at the Madejski Stadium.

A scrappy game was settled towards the end of the first half, when Charlton's leading goalscorer Igor Vetokele headed in from close range.

Gary Rowett's unbeaten start as Birmingham manager continued with a spirited goalless draw against Cardiff.

Former Birmingham loanee Federico Macheda stabbed home early in the second half for Cardiff and Blues substitute Wes Thomas also had the ball in the net, but both were denied by the flag as Rowett moved to three games unbeaten since replacing Lee Clark while Cardiff await their first away league win this season.

Sheffield Wednesday's home drought continued as their South Yorkshire derby with Rotherham ended goalless  at Hillsborough.

The Owls, who are now nine games without a win in the league, have not scored for over 400 minutes in front of their own fans,
