AT&T, under fire for ongoing revelations that it shares and sells
customers' communications records to the National Security Agency and 
other U.S. intelligence offices, says it isn't required to disclose to 
shareholders what it does with customers' data.

In a letter sent Thursday to the Securities and Exchange Commission, 
AT&T said it protects customer information and complies with 
government requests for records 'only to the extent required by law'.

The telecom giant's letter was a response to a shareholder revolt 
sparked on Nov. 20 by the New York State Common Retirement Fund, the 
ACLU of Northern California and others.

The groups are demanding that 
AT&T and Verizon be more transparent about their dealings with the 
NSA.

In the letter, AT&T said information about assisting foreign 
intelligence surveillance activities is almost certainly classified.

Telecom giant AT&T, who are in the midst of a shareholder revolt following revelations they sold communications data to the NSA, say they are under no legal obligation to disclose their dealings because it is 'classified'

The
company said it should not have to address the issue at its annual 
shareholders meeting this spring.

Nicole Ozer, technology and civil liberties policy director at the 
ACLU of Northern California said AT&T has overstepped its bounds.

'It's outrageous that AT&T is trying to block the shareholder 
proposal,' she said.

'Customers have a right to know how often their 
private information is ending up in the government's hands.'

AT&T spokesman Mark Siegel said: 'The letter speaks for itself. We have no comment beyond it.'

After the Sept. 11 terror attacks, U.S agencies established a 
warrantless program to monitor phone calls and e-mail between 
individuals in the United States and other countries who are suspected 
of having links to terrorism.

But disclosures in recent weeks from 
former intelligence contractor Edward Snowden have exposed the breadth 
and depth of U.S. government surveillance programs on the Internet and 
over other telecommunications networks.

The Washington Post reported 
this week that the NSA tracks locations of nearly 5 billion cellphones 
every day overseas, including those of Americans.

Companies are responding to the revelations in a variety of ways.

Tech firms including Yahoo and Google are pushing back, adding 
encryption, filing motions in the FISA court, and arguing that the NSA 
is overstepping its bounds.

But telecommunications firms appear to be cooperating fully.

Pro-rights groups say the response by AT&T is 'outrageous' and that 'customers have a right to known when their private information is ending up in the governments' hands'

'AT&T has not made it clear to investors or customers what data 
it shares or with whom. Customers should not be the last to know how 
their personal information is being used by governmental agencies,' said
New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli.

DiNapoli co-signed the AT&T shareholder resolution on behalf of 
the New York State Common Retirement Fund, which holds assets totaling 
about $161 billion.

The fund owns more than 15 million shares of 
AT&T valued at roughly $517 million.

'Customer trust is critical for any business, but nowhere is it more 
so than for those corporations that handle our personal data and 
communications,' DiNapoli said.

AT&T shareholders Trillium Asset Management in Boston and Durham,
N.C.-based Arjuna Capital/Baldwin Brothers were also part of the 
revolt, which demands that AT&T publish semi-annual transparency 
reports similar to those from Microsoft, Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook and
Yahoo.

The companies disclose the number of government requests for 
information and whether they comply.

But AT&T noted that those transparency reports don't disclose 
details about the requests or even separate out the number of National 
Security Letters companies receive.

That information is withheld by the 
companies because they are barred by the federal government from 
revealing it, a prohibition many companies are fighting in court.

'In fact, all six Internet companies referenced in the 
(shareholder's) proposal state that they are not allowed to publicly 
disclose any such information in their Transparency or Law Enforcement 
Request Reports,' said AT&T.

'Therefore, because the proposal is 
over-broad, it is excludable...'

AT&T also argues that the issue of their disclosure practices 
with the NSA has not been a topic of 'sustained debate over the last 
several years,' a standard they say must be met to require public 
reporting.

Securities and Exchange Commission spokeswoman Christina D'Amico said the agency declined to comment.
