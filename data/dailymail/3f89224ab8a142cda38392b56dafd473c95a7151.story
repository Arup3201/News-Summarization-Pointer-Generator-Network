James Burley, pictured outside Newcastle Crown Court yesterday, denies racially aggravated harassment

A woman was subjected to a shocking racist poison pen campaign by her former partner after she brought her new black boyfriend into a village community, a court heard.

James Burley is accused of claiming his ex-partner Sharon Auld was breaking the village 'code of conduct' when she brought her African boyfriend to Pegswood, Northumberland.

Newcastle Crown Court heard yesterday that Miss Auld’s new partner Frank Olufemi was the only Nigerian living in the former mining village when Burley began his harassment campaign in 2010.

In a series of vile notes to Miss 
Auld, one of which arrived on the day she became engaged to her new 
partner, the 74-year-old branded Africans paedophiles, said they were 
all born with Aids and that Mr Olufemi should be sent back to the 
'jungle', it is claimed.

Prosecutor Christopher Rose told the court the first letter was sent to Ms Auld’s mother in March 2010.

Extracts
of it were read out in court, which said: 'We don’t do black. You 
Auld’s must be the only lot who don’t know the code of conduct in our 
village.

'We think you should get it sorted. You know as well as anyone they are born with Aids, it would be a shame if you got that as well.'

The next correspondence arrived on the very day Ms Auld, whose five year relationship with Burley ended in 2006, got engaged to Mr Olufemi and contained a newspaper cutting referring to conflict in Nigeria.

More letters were received in June, one of which referred to the note sent to Ms Auld’s mother.

One said: 'Nothing has seemed to change. We take it she condones your stupid actions or you just do as you want to.'

The same letter continued: 'Aids came from men in Nigeria having sex with small boys and bringing it into our country.'

Another extract said: 'Throw him back into the jungle where he belongs. Get out of our village with this horrible black man.

'We don’t do black in this village. We should not have to repeat our feelings.'

A letter sent in July of that year questioned how Mr Olufemi’s would provide for Ms Auld and said he only wanted a British Visa.

In other letters Ms Auld was branded the 'village trollop' and called a 'slut' and there was an explicit sexual reference.

One comment regarding Mr Olufemi said: 'He looks as though someone has been chopping sticks on his face, he has a big mouth, massive lips.'

A further letter sent in December 2010 said Ms Auld had made a 'mistake' bringing a black man into the village.

The court heard eight diaries were found during a search of Burley’s home  some of which contained similar extracts to what was said in the letters.

Burley’s DNA was found in saliva on the seal of one of the envelopes which contained an offensive letter.

One letter that arrived spoke in ‘glowing terms’ about Burley and made reference to the breakdown of the relationship between him and Ms Auld.

Ms Auld told jurors she was 'gobsmacked' to receive the offensive material on the day of her engagement.

She told jurors: 'I was just gobsmacked and quite upset about it. It was just trying to tell me Nigerians were evil people basically.'

Mr Rose told jurors: 'The prosecution say each and every message was sent with the aim of harassing Sharon Auld and knowing it would cause her harassment.

'The references to her new partner are obviously racist in nature.'

The court heard Burley began a relationship with Ms Auld in 2001 despite being married.

Mr Rose, prosecuting, said: 'It was at the time a relationship which must have caused no small amount of upset to the defendant’s family as he was married.

'When the relationship ended in the summer of 2006, at Ms Auld’s behest, it will have caused the defendant a great deal of upset and bitterness.

'It is perhaps because of that, the prosecution say, this offence occurs.'

Burley told police he had not sent the letters and suggested they must have been sent by a friend of his.

That man has since died but his daughter told police her father had never been friends with Burley.

Burley, of Pegswood, Northumberland, denies racially aggravated harassment.

The trial continues.
