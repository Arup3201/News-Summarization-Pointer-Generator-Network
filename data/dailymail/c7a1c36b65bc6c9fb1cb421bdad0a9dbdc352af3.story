Manchester City midfielder Yaya Toure has again sparked rumours he could be set to leave the Premier League champions in the near future by refusing to rule out a transfer to Paris Saint-Germain.

Toure has endured an inconsistent start with City so far this season and has been repeatedly  linked with a move to Laurent Blanc's side.

And he admitted the opportunity to play for the French champions would be something he would have to consider.

'You never close the door to a big club,' Toure said in an interview with RMC radio station in France. 

'The important thing is to continue my job, you do not know what might happen tomorrow. 

'It is always an objective to play at big clubs and win trophies,' he added. 'The most important thing is to continue to learn.'

PSG manager Laurent Blanc is rumoured to be interested in signing Toure for the French champions

City are currently third in the Premier League and face fifth-placed Swansea at the Etihad on Saturday.

Toure fired 20 goals as City won the Premier League last season, but has only managed to find the net once so far in this year's competition.
