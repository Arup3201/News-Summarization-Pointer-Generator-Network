Cheerleaders, lacrosse players, artsy kids and everyone in between showcase their skills wearing uniforms and club t-shirts and only required one take to get the sensational video just right.

It all culminates to a scene in the school gymnasium where the thousands of students wave a gleeful hello to viewers that numbers nearly 200,000 after only a few days on YouTube.

The sound track includes some of last year's most beloved hits with songs from everyone from Jay-Z to Selena Gomez in a mashup called Pop Danthology 2013.

According to local Fox affiliate WXIN, the video was the brainchild of the student body government who made up their minds to pull off the stunt last fall and has since been working studiously to convince all the many groups at Avon to commit.

The kids did a single dress rehearsal prior to their stunning single take, which was shot and edited by student Suketu Patel.
