Life has not always been easy  for Anne, Britain’s last circus elephant, whose story touched the nation after footage emerged of her being beaten by her groom.

But the time has finally come for her to put her feet up – as she retires to a £1.2millon luxury home partly funded by kind-hearted Daily Mail readers.

Work is due to begin this month on the enclosure at Longleat Safari Park, which our readers donated more than £350,000 to help build. It should be finished within a year.

Footage was handed to the Daily Mail in 2011 of 
Anne being beaten by her Romanian keeper. He fled, but Bobby Roberts, 
the owner of the circus, was prosecuted for allowing the abuse

The development, to be known as Anne’s Haven, will include under-floor heating, a bathing pool and a four-acre garden.

Asian elephant Anne, who is in her sixties, was rescued from the Bobby Roberts Super Circus three years ago after the horrific video of her suffering was passed to the Daily Mail.

Nicolai Nitu, the Romanian groom 
filmed beating her with a pitchfork, fled after welfare charity Animal 
Defenders International released the footage.

However, circus boss Bobby 
Roberts, from Northamptonshire, was found guilty of animal cruelty in 
2012 after it emerged he kept her constantly chained in her winter 
quarters and failed to prevent the abuse.

Anne, who is Europe’s oldest elephant, was brought over from Sri Lanka in the 1950s and worked in the circus for 50 years.

Since being rescued and moved to 
Longleat, Wiltshire, she has had physiotherapy for her arthritis and is 
now being cared for by three designated keepers, a vet and an osteopath.

Longleat’s experts decided that it is best for Anne to live alone for the time being, due to her age and health problems.

But the building can house up to four elephants, and the park said it remained open to the possibility of rehoming others in need of rehabilitation.

Jon Cracknell, director of animal operations at Longleat, said: ‘Anne’s health has dramatically improved since she arrived. Her transformation has been incredible.’
