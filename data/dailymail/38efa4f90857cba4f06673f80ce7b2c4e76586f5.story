A coroner has called for permanent zip-wires to be regulated after Bailey Sumner (above), 11, died in a fall from one at a children's adventure park

A coroner yesterday called for tighter regulation of leisure zip-wires after a boy of 11 fell to his death from one at a children’s adventure park.

Bailey Sumner plunged 30ft from a 500ft-long ride because he had been wrongly attached to his harness by a poorly-trained member of staff, an inquest heard.

The Swampflyer at GreenWood Forest Park, near Caernarvon, north Wales, had been open just a week when the accident happened on Easter Sunday two years ago. Bailey, who had been visiting the park with his parents and sister Jessica, suffered a fractured skull and died in hospital from his injuries.

Police investigated but prosecutors decided to take no further action against the park. However, officials from Gwynedd council last night confirmed its inquiry into ‘possible regulatory breaches’ was continuing. The ride has been dismantled.

Yesterday North Wales coroner Nicola Jones, sitting at Dolgellau magistrates court, expressed concern that anyone could set up a zip-wire without licence or regulation.

‘There’s no statutory or other regulation of permanent zipwires,’ Mrs Jones said. ‘They are something of a boom industry, they seem to be cropping up everywhere. Anyone of us could set up our own permanent zipwire without a licence and the safety being checked. The lack of guidance (from the authorities) played a significant part in how Bailey has come to die.’

She said she would be writing to the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) and other agencies demanding action be taken to prevent a similar tragedy.

The jury was read a statement from park ‘ranger’ Sion Hughes, 23, who clipped Bailey on to the thrill-seeking ride. Mr Hughes, who had been employed for just a few days, said he felt staff had been ‘inadequately’ trained and that he had too much responsibility.

‘My heart stopped whenever someone stepped off (the platform), it was nerve wracking,’ he said. But he failed to raise his concerns with his boss or the park owner.

The court was told that Mr Hughes watched Bailey on the wire for a short distance before turning round to assist the next rider. He then heard a ‘loud thump’.

Mr Hughes suggested Bailey, from Blackpool, might have tampered with his harness, causing him to fall. But HSE inspector Louise Robinson said that was ‘highly unlikely’. Colleague Dave Riley said human error was the most likely explanation.

The mistake – which occurred because the youngster was wrongly attached to a ‘false loop’ in a rope lanyard dangling from the cable – should have been spotted during the pre-launch checks, Stephen Bristow, managing director of the park, said. The jury returned a verdict of accidental death.

The Swampflyer opened on April 17, 2011, a week before the tragedy. Following the incident, it was dismantled
