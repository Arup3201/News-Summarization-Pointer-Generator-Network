Better start looking under the sofa and in your coat pockets...

Lottery officials in both California and New Jersey say two unclaimed winning tickets which are worth around $250,000 each will soon expire.

In New Jersey, state officials say one Mega Millions ticket which was sold at a Wegmans super market will expire within two weeks.

Get looking: Lottery tickets from New Jersey and California are about to expire within the next few weeks with prizes of $250,000 on the line

Winning location: One of the tickets was purchased at this gas station in San Jose, California

That ticket matched the five winning numbers, but not the Powerball. The winning sequence for that drawing was 8, 9, 16, 32 and 39 with a Mega Ball number of 15 and a Mega multiplier of 3.

In California, a winning Powerball ticket, purchased May 15 at a San Jose gas station, will expire one month later on November 11th if nobody comes forward to claim the cash.

On this ticket, five winning numbers were matched apart from the Powerball.

If the California ticket isn't claimed, the prize money would be given to the stateâ€™s public school system.
