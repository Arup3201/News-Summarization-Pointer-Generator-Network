The parents of a six-month-old baby born with a congenital heart defect have finally been given some good news, that she will have access to lifesaving surgery.

For the past six months, Darwin parents Lambros and Sandra Pastrikos have faced an uphill battle in the fight to keep their daughter, now one year old, Doreen, alive.

Born with a condition known as Tetralogy of Fallot, which stops the heart delivering enough blood to the lungs, Dora was prevented from having life-saving operation at Melbourne's Royal Children's Hospital in February because of a severe change in her condition.

For the past six months, Darwin parents Lambros and Sandra Pastrikos have faced an uphill battle in the fight to keep their daughter, now one year old, Doreen, alive. Born with a condition known as Tetralogy of Fallot, which stops the heart delivering enough blood to the lungs

She suffered a 'tet spell', brought about by a dramatic drop in the amount of oxygen in the blood, which placed her in intensive care and ruled her out for surgery.

The NT News have reported Dora saw a Melbourne specialist neurologist last week and following on from that, news she will finally get to undertake surgery.  

'I feel vindicated, but our calls needed to be heard a long time ago,' Ms Pastrikos told the NT News. 

'This has been an incredibly draining, emotional roller coaster and we have fought this decision as much as we could,' she said.

At the time her daughter's surgery was denied, Ms Pastrikos squared the blame on Royal Darwin clinicians for failing to provide a proper duty of care.

She demanded an inquiry be undertaken to investigate claiming she wasn't told about her daughter's condition straight away. 

Since February, Dora's family have been warned to prepare for her death but have been inspired by her will to live.

'Dora was taken off her respirator and moved to the Hospice ... but this little girl has just not given up and defied odds every second of the way,' Mrs Pastrikos told NT News.

'The aim of the surgery is to stop the tet spells and give Dora a chance at a normal life without the oxygen and feeding tubes,' said mum Sandra Pastrikos

She said she burst into tears on hearing the great news that her daughter would have a second chance in life and despite the risks, is very positive the procedure will be a success.

'The aim of the surgery is to stop the tet spells and give Dora a chance at a normal life without the oxygen and feeding tubes,' she said. 

There was elation all around when Dora's family learned off her surgery, posting their delight on Dora's update page on facebook. 

On Wednesday it read, 'hi everyone! Today we received some fantastic news, Melbourne have decided to operate on Dora!'

'Her operation will be scheduled for some time next week! We are so very happy and we thank everybody for all your support!'

'Please don't stop praying as she still needs to get through the operation and get home.'

On Sunday another post to the site where family members said they were glad Dora had got a second chance.

Dora has surgery scheduled for November 12 by leading cardiac surgery Dr Yves d'Udekem

'She has proven EVERYONE wrong. We are so happy that she will finally be receiving the procedure she deserves and to be having it done by the same surgeon that saved my sons life with his heart condition seven and a half years ago.'

'DORA you certainly are an angel.'

Dora's surgery, scheduled for November 12, is set to be done by leading cardiac surgeon Dr Yves d'Udekem.

Earlier in the year, the director of medical services at RDH Dr Sara Watson confirmed that the patient (Doreen) was being treated appropriately under the care of local senior specialists in conjunction with interstate specialists.

Ms Watson also said, 'In what looked like a positive sign of hope for the family, doctors had come forward with an offer to perform the surgery just three weeks ago, but that has since lapsed because of a high chance it could leave the six-month-old with brain damage.'
