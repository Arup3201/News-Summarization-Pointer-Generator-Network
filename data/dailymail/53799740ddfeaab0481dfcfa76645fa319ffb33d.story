Though Hamas rockets fill the skies over Israel, residents of cosmopolitan Tel Aviv have been seen hitting the beach, joyfully plunging into the water when the air raid sirens stop and the coast is clear.

The threat of violence has hung heavy over the region since the creation of the state in 1948, and as a result Israelis have become accustomed to a daily reality that would fill the people of other westernised nations with dread.

Because of its distance from the volatile Gaza strip, the coastal city became known as 'the bubble', avoiding the security threats faced by Israelis in other parts of the country.

However, as a result of the increasing sophistication and range of the rockets fired by militants, the city first came under fire in 2012 and today more volleys were fired, although all were brought down by the Israeli military's Iron Dome missile defence system.

The relaxed attitude exhibited by the people of Tel Aviv may have something to do with the fact that not a single Israeli has died as a result of the launches -Â  a stark comparison to the estimated 170 Palestinians who have died from Israeli Defence Force airstrikes and artillery fire.

'After a while you almost get used to the sound of the air raid sirens, but not completely,' Meytal Cohen, who works in a Tel Aviv women's accessory store told USA Today.

She added that she refused to shut up shop and stay at home because it 'would be handing Hamas a victory and I refuse to do that'.

Wrath: Rockets fired from the northern Gaza Strip into Israel

Palestinian militants resumed rocket attacks on Tel Aviv on Monday after a 24-hour lull in strikes on the Israeli commercial capital, and Israel kept up its air and naval bombardments of the Gaza Strip despite growing international pressure for a ceasefire.

The military said it had shot down a drone from Gaza, the first reported deployment of an unmanned aircraft by Palestinian militants and a possible step up in the sophistication of their arsenal, although it was not clear whether it was armed.

Their rocket attacks have been regularly intercepted but more than half a dozen Israelis have been wounded since the start of the week-old offensive.

Gaza health officials say Israeli air strikes have killed 170 Palestinians, most of them civilians.

The violence was prompted by the murder of three Israeli teenagers and revenge killing of a Palestinian youth. Israeli officials said on Monday three people arrested over the Palestinian's death had confessed to burning him alive.

Egypt and Qatar are seen as potential mediators but peace efforts were complicated by Hamas's rejection of a mere 'calm for calm' in which both sides hold their fire in favour of wider conditions including prisoner release and an end to Israel's Gaza blockade.

The Israeli army said its aircraft and naval gunboats attacked dozens of targets in the Gaza Strip and that Palestinian militants fired more than 20 rockets into Israel, slightly wounding a boy in the town of Ashdod, where a home was damaged, and two girls, 11 and 13, near Beersheba.

Palestinian health officials said at least 20 people in Gaza were wounded.

But Israel did not carry out a threat to step up attacks against rocket-launching sites it said were hidden among civilian homes in the town of Beit Lahuiya after urging residents there to leave. A U.N. aid agency said around a quarter of the town's 70,000 residents had fled.

Tel Aviv experienced a rare lull in morning rocket strikes, but they resumed during the evening rush hour, with Iron Dome going into action.

Police said there were no casualties or damage. Hamas, the Islamist group which runs Gaza, said its armed wing had sent several locally-made drones to carry out 'special missions' deep inside Israel.

A military spokesman said the drone was shot down near the port of Ashdod, about 25 km (15 miles) north of Gaza, by a U.S.-built Patriot missile, used largely ineffectively by Israel against Iraqi Scud missiles in the 1991 Gulf War.
