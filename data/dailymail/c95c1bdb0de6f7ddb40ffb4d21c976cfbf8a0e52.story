Plans to harvest private data from patients’ NHS files are causing a ‘crisis of public confidence’, the Royal College of GPs said yesterday.

The professional body said it was ‘very worried’ that the public had not been properly informed about the scheme, which is due to begin this spring.

Information about past illnesses, medication, weight and blood pressure will be taken from medical files and put into a database unless patients opt out.

The Royal College of GPs has warned the NHS that they face a backlash for lack of information about their data sharing plans

NHS officials say the data will be used for important research and to show up poor care – and that all the data will be made anonymous.

But experts say patients will be identifiable from their data – which will be passed on to private companies including insurance firms.

A growing number of GPs oppose the care.data scheme, and say their patients will refuse to give them information for fear it will be harvested.

Yesterday the Royal College – which represents 46,000 GPs – accused NHS officials of failing to inform patients about the scheme.

The organisation said patients had not been told why their data was needed, nor how they could opt out.

Professor Nigel Mathers, the Royal College’s honorary secretary, said: ‘We are very concerned that, with just seven weeks to go before the roll out, the public have not been properly informed about the benefits of and the safeguards surrounding the care.data  program.

The result of the failure to make the case for  the scheme is the crisis of  public confidence that we are now seeing.

‘We urgently need a renewed national push by the authorities to ensure that patients are fully informed about the benefits of the scheme, what their rights are, and what their rights to opt out are.’

The warning comes just days after the Royal College’s former chairman backed the scheme by claiming it was ‘perfectly safe’.

Patient data about their previous medications, medical histories, procedures and other personal information risks being shared to private companies like insurance companies, something that might cause the NHS to face a trust crisis

Dr Clare Gerada, who stepped down in October, said patients had ‘nothing to fear’ by sharing their data and promised it would be held in a ‘safe haven’.

Writing in a national newspaper, she added: ‘We, patients and citizens alike, will all be the beneficiaries, as scientists, analysts and health service planners will have access to  an amazing source of information.’ 

But at least four GPs are so opposed to the scheme they have opted out all the thousands of patients on their lists – apart from a few who are willing for their data to be shared.

These four include Dr Gordon Gancz, who practises in Oxford and has been warned by NHS officials that his actions may cost him his job.

The scheme is set to begin next month. At first, data will only be taken from a few  surgeries to check the system works properly.

It will then be rolled out nationally in April. NHS England claim the data will reveal where patients are receiving a lower standard of care.

But officials admit data will also be shared with private firms – including insurers – who could use it to drive up premiums for patients with certain illnesses. 

Last week data expert Professor Sir Brian Jarman warned that firms could track down individuals within a few hours.

The information is meant to be stored anonymously – with only dates of birth and postcodes on file – but Sir Brian said it would be easy to find patients from those details.

Last month the NHS began posting leaflets about the scheme but in many instances they have been thrown out as junk mail. And the leaflets do not fully explain how to opt out, with some surgeries asking for it in writing and others wanting it done by phone.

Phil Booth, of the campaign group medConfidential, said: ‘This publicity campaign has been a complete fiasco. There is absolutely no justification now for the upload of information from patients’ records.

‘NHS England has failed to communicate what it is doing. Virtually none of the people I meet – normal folk – are aware that anything is going on.

‘If they are going to have an opt-out mechanism, they must write to each patient and tell them exactly what is happening with their data, why and to whom it is going to go.’
