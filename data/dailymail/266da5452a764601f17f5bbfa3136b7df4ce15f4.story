An 18-year-old California man is facing assault and battery charges for kicking a boy in the head and jumping on his face with his full body weight.

Robert Velentin Ayala of Ladera Ranch, Orange County was charged Wednesday with aggravated assault and battery with serious bodily injury. Another boy, 17, has also been charged in the attack, but as a minor his charges have not been disclosed.

The vicious attack was captured on camera phone by the victim's friend and posted to the Facebook page called Ladera Ranch No Bullying.

The 17-year-old boy can also be seen in the video punching the 16-year-old victim repeatedly as he lies motionless on the ground.

According to KTLA, the fight took place at Chaparral Elementary School, five miles from where all three attend Tesoro High School, after school hours.

The younger boy is seen in the video being wrestled to the ground and repeatedy punched by the 17-year-old, who is considerably larger than he is.

As the victim struggles on the ground, Ayala can be seen approaching and appears to kick him square in the head, apparently knocking him unconscious.

Callous: The 17-year-old punched the victim in the head eight times before Ayala dropped his entire body weight on the unconscious boy's head

The 17-year-old, who cannot be named because of his age, then punches the victim eight more times.

Finally, Ayala jumps in the air and lands with his full body weight on the boy's face in a wrestling move known as a 'leg drop.'

The 17-year-old and victim reportedly had a longstanding feud and had previously fought each other in middle school.

The attack was filmed by the victim's friend, who said he was surrounded by the attackers' friends and unable to help the victim but later gave the video to Orange County sheriff's deputies.

According to KTLA, the boy suffered a broken nose, a concussion and many cuts and bruises.

The victim doesn't remember the violent melee at all, according to police.

Ayala was arrested in class and read his Miranda rights, students told KTLA. 

He is being held on $50,000 bail.
