Frankie Gavin plans to bring a world title to Birmingham after revealing the chance to fight in his hometown was key in his decision to join Eddie Hearn's Matchroom stable.

Former world amateur champion Gavin was unveiled as Hearn's latest signing on Tuesday, joining fellow Brummies Kal and Gamal Yafai, Matthew Macklin and Sam Eggington in Hearn's stable.

The 29-year-old welterweight, who has only boxed twice in the Second City in 22 professional fights so far, admitted the chance to win world honours in Birmingham was a deciding factor.

'Birmingham was the inkling behind it as well as getting more fights,' he said.

'I'm from Birmingham and I should be fighting in Birmingham. Not just the midlands, Birmingham specifically. I should be fighting here.'

Gavin, who parted company with previous promoter Frank Warren last week, added: 'I'm not a bad ticket seller and I believe I should be headlining bills.

Eddie Hearn tweeted to welcome his new recruit to the Matchroom stable on Tuesday

'I make my debut for Matchroom on Kell Brook's undercard in March and my second fight will be top of the bill in Birmingham in May.

'When Eddie mentioned Birmingham for my second fight I thought he meant just being on the card but actually I'm headlining it and that shows you the plans they have for me.

'I'll fight for the WBA intercontinental title in March to get my ranking even higher with that body then I'll fight for the European title in May. Once I've won that it's time to go for world titles.'
