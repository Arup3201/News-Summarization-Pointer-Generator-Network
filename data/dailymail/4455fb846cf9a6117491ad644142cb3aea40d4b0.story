Justin Bieber's mentor Usher and his manager Scooter Braun have arrived in Panama for talks with the troubled teen star.

The two men who could feasibly halt the 19-year-old's downward trajectory were snapped posing with fans at the luxury resort where Justin and his entourage have bedded down.

Justin's childhood friend Ryan Butler is also present, according to TMZ, meaning that this powerful triumvirate could perhaps counter some of the party elements in Justin's crew, including 'bad girl' Chantel Jeffries.

Usher and Braun were snapped posing 
with Bieber's fans at the resort, one in particular, Roseta Bordanea, 
seemed to be spending time with the crew.

Those
 closest to Bieber believe the young star is out of control and claim he
 is spending as much as £5,000 a week on marijuana.

Speaking
 to the Sun On Sunday, friends say cannabis and addictive codeine based 
mixture ‘sizzurp’ are two of an array of drugs the hit-maker is taking 
on a daily basis.

Miss Jeffries, who partied with Justin the night he was busted in Miami, was a constant companion of the pop star in Panama

On Sunday, he was mobbed by fans - mostly young Panamanian girls - after it became public that he was chilling out in Panama

‘Weed plays a huge part in Justin’s life,’ a source told the paper. ‘He smokes 12 bongs a day and can spend £5,000 a week. He also takes relaxant Xanax and sleep aid Ambien.

‘For his sizzurp, Justin gets bulk shipments of the codeine syrup he likes from Canada then mixes it with Fanta Pineapple before dropping a sweet in it. He even has a child’s sippy cup of it by his bed.’

Bieber was arrested in Miami last Thursday morning for drag racing a rented Lamborghini, driving under the influence and resisting arrest.

Worryingly, the singer’s father Jeremy was reportedly driving close behind on the night, after spending much of the evening partying with his son at SET nightclub.

'His father was the one who was helping clear the street so Justin could race his Lamborghini,' a source told MailOnline.

Bieber’s grinning mugshot has since been beamed all over the world, but while the teenager, released after bail was set at $2,500, attempts to escape media scrutiny with a trip to Panama, pals say there is only one person who has the power to kerb his wayward antics – on-off girlfriend Selena Gomez.

‘She’s the only person who seems to have an effect,’ added the source. ‘But just when she thinks he has changes he does something outrageous.

‘He thinks he is invincible. He’s out of control. Hopefully he’ll see sense before it’s too late.’

MailOnline have contacted Justin’s representatives for further comment.
