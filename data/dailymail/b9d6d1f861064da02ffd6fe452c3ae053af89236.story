One of France's main newspapers has published its entire front page 'in the language of Shakespeare' as the row over the encroachment of English in the country deepens.

Under the 1994 ‘Toubon’ law the use of 
foreign languages in French classes is all but banned.

The French daily Liberation made the editorial decision to print its front page in English in support of a growing campaign to allow its use in the classroom.

Taking a stand: Left-leaning daily newspaper Liberation left little doubt which side of the argument its on with its front page

The contentious issue has split many as new proposals suggest relaxing the current rules.

The left-leaning newspaper pulled the stunt to demonstrate its stance in favour of the rules being relaxed.

With a simple headline reading: 'Let's do it', the newspaper left its readers in little doubt of where it stands in the debate.

Unfortunately, not all readers will have understood the statement being made, as there was no translation into French.

But many in France strongly believe that the increasing use of English in the classroom will lead to the deterioration of the country's own language.

Journalist Bernard Pivot told thedrum.com: 'If we
allow English to be introduced into our universities and for teaching 
science and the modern world, French will be vandalised and become 
poorer.'
