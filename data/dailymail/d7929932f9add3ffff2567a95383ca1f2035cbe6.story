Britain's Michael Jamieson added silver to Team GB's fantastic day 5 medal haul after a powerhouse performance in the 200m breaststroke final.

The 23-year-old Scot came from behind on his last length and only narrowly failed to overtake Hungarian Daniel Gyurta, who won gold and set a new world record.

Jamieson's time of 2:07.43 is a new British record and would have been good enough to set a world record, had it not been for Gyurta's heroics.

Ryo Tateishi, who won gold in Athens and Beijing had to settle for bronze.

There was disappointment for 
Jamieson's best friend and training partner, 21-year-old Andrew Willis 
who was in bronze medal position at the half way mark but faded at the 
end and finished eight.

Jamieson (second top) and Willis (second bottom) started strongly with  Japan's Kosuke Kitajima (bottom) and eventual winner Hungary's Daniel Gyurta

Speaking
 poolside at the Aquatics Centre, Glasgow-born Jamieson paid tribute to 
the crowd who pushed him through the heats and last night's semi-final, 
when he also broke the British Record.

He
 said: 'I loved it. I had a little more to give after last night. It's 
so much easier to swim with a bit of confidence behind you.

'I was desperate to get on the podium
 tonight to repay the faith and support we've had. I forgot about the 
time tonight - it was more tactical. I tried to stay on Gyurta's 
shoulder for the first hundred. I wanted to have everything on the line.

'I had planned for this night and that helped with the nerves beforehand. For so many years I have gone over this in my head.'

Magnanimous in defeat, Willis insisted he was thrilled one of them could taste medal success.

He
 said: 'That was tough race and I gave it my all. I'm very happy for 
Michael - he deserves it 100%. It was great for me to experience as 
well.'

Elsewhere in the pool, Britain's Jemma Lowe fell just short in the 200m butterfly final.

The
 22-year-old from Hartlepool started strongly and was in the bronze 
medal position at the half way mark, but faded in the last length, 
finishing sixth.

China's Liuyang Jiao won gold, 
setting a new Olympic record. Silver went to Spain's Mireia Garcia 
Belmonte with a bronze for Japan's Natsumi Hoshi.

Lowe was pleased with her performance. She said: 'It was an Olympic final and I was really happy to get into it. I gave it everything I got but it wasn't to be.

'The crowd were brilliant. I was a bit nervous but I have had a good time in my second Olympics. Definitely 'not my last Games'. I feel like I am still young and I am looking forward to having more races.'

Earlier on there was joy for Fran Halsall who qualified for the 100m 
freestyle final with a fourth place finish in her semi-final.

Team GB teammate Amy Smith finished 8th in the same heat and won't make the final.

Swimmers have created a surge in demand for sound-blocking headphones.

The devices, which cut out all background noise,  have overtaken more traditional earplug designs, says Amazon.

Athletes are said to favour the  Beats by Dr Dre phones because they allow them to concentrate in the moments before they swim.

This week spectators at the Aquatics Centre were left disappointed after several swimmers, including gold medal winner Sun Yang, walked to the pool wearing the headphones, blocking out their cheers.

Halsall refused to get carried away 
with her qualification, insisting she'll need to take almost 2 seconds 
off her time of 53.77 if she has any chance of making the podium 
tomorrow.

The 22-year-old from Southport said:
 'Tomorrow it will take a 52 to win it. I felt awful this morning but 
tonight felt really smooth and easy and I cruised the last 10m'

And she urged to crowd to out shout the Americans cheering for their swimming idol Missy Franklin.

Halsall
 added: 'Anything can happen in an Olympic final and I'm in it to win 
it. The crowd were amazing, but it was just as amazing for Missy 
Franklin. Any Brits that come tomorrow, I want you to shout louder than 
the Americans did!'

Team GB's relay team finished fifth in the women's 4x200m freestyle relay behind gold medal winners USA, who set a new Olympic medal, lead by Allison Schmitt.

Australia won silver, ahead of France with bronze.
