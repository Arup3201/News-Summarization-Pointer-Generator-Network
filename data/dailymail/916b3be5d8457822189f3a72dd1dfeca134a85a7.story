West Ham and QPR are keen to sign Scotland Under-21 left-back Stephen Hendrie in a £2million deal. 

The 19-year-old Hamilton Academical defender is tipped to follow in the footsteps of Hull’s Andy Robertson who has excelled since moving from Dundee United.

Hamilton chairman Les Gray: ‘West Ham have been watching Stephen for some time, as have several major clubs including QPR. That’s the level we are discussing.

Sam Allardyce's Hammers are said to have been watching the Hamilton defender 'for some time'

‘There is nothing concrete at this stage, but that will all kick off now I am sure. 

'He is under contract, under 23, has played over 100 games and is part of the Scotland U19 set-up.

‘So if somebody was to come in with the right offer we would not stand in the boy’s way. We promote our kids and encourage them to move to the next level.’

QPR and Harry Redknapp are also interested, although the manager has ruled out any permanent signings
