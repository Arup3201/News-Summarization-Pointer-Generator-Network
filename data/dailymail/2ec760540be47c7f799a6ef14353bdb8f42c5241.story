The White House published its annual list of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue staff their salaries today.

This year's list reveals that 456 aides serve at the pleasure of the president and make anywhere from $42,000 a year to $172,200 a year.

Among the highest paid White House staffers are: National Security Adviser Susan Rice, Senior Adviser to the president Valerie Jarrett, White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest and Counselor to the president John Podesta.

The White House has been required by law to disclose the names, titles and salaries of every one of its employees to Congress since 1995.

'Consistent with President Obama's commitment to transparency,' Obama's administration has also opted to make the data available to the public each year in an easily searchable chart.

Because of a pay freeze instituted by the president, senior-level White House staffers have continued to earn same exact amount as they did when the president took office.

However, entry and mid level staffers have seen their stock go up in the Obama presidency from a base pay of $36,000 in 2009 to $42,000 this year.

Furthermore, the White House lifted its pay freeze on employees making less than $100,000, a White House official told ABC News, allowing dozens of lowly White House employees, including press assistants, analysts and staff assistants, to take advantage of a one percent increase in pay for federal workers signed into law by the president last December.

Other notable White House officials bringing home the big bucks are: Dan Pfieffer, senior adviser to the president, Tony Blinken, a deputy national security adviser, and Ben Rhodes, another deputy national security adviser.

White House Communications Director Jennifer Palmieri, Director of the National Economic Council Jeffrey Zients, and the first lady's Chief of Staff Tina Tchen all make $172,200 a year as well.
