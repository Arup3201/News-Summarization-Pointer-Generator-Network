A seven-year-old boy has been left with permanent sight damage after a freak loom band accident.

Kyle Lawrence’s brother accidentally flicked one of the popular bands into his eye while they were making a bracelet, leading to him developing a cataract.

His family, who had been hoping doctors would be able to restore Kyle's sight, have now been given the devastating news the damage to his eye is permanent.

Hospital treatment: Kyle Lawrence, of Cleethorpes, whose left eye was injured by a loom band bracelet

Specialists at Sheffield’s Children’s Hospital have said the youngster has lasting muscle damage to his left eye.

It has clouding on the lens that causes his pupil to look consistently dilated and all he can see is shadows.

Now Kyle, of Cleethorpes, Lincolnshire, has been forbidden from participating in any ball games - in case he suffers any further injury.

His mother Carlie said: 'Once he had different tests, we were told that he couldn’t have an operation.

'We had been told that they would be able to do something with his cataract and that he’d have full sight but it turns out the damage is permanent.'

The mother-of-six is now warning other parents of the dangers posed by loom bands - and says they should carry a safety warning. 

Kyle's accident happened as he and his brothers and sisters sat using 
loom bands with their mother at the family home in Cleethorpes, 
Lincolnshire, at the end of May.

Injuries: The incident caused a blood clot - 
leaving Kyle completely blind in his left eye. His family had hoped he could undergo restorative surgery, but doctors say there is permanent damage to the eye muscle

They were making rainbow loom sandals, which feature a band around the ankle with a strap which hooks around a toe.

One
 of the bands needed stretching to fit but as his eldest brother pulled 
it, it slipped from his fingers and hit Kyle in the eye.

Mrs Lawrence, 32, said: ‘He was screaming in pain and I have never heard
 him scream before. He started being violently sick.

‘I couldn’t go near Kyle after it happened, my husband had to deal with it. I was so scared.

‘My husband told me to call an ambulance and we had to take Kyle out of the room to try and calm him down.’

Kyle was taken to accident and emergency, where he was examined before being sent home the same night with eye drops.

But
 after he continued being sick throughout the night his mother took him 
back to hospital the next day.

An eye expert said he should not have 
been sent home and admitted Kyle to hospital for six days, after which 
he needed a further week’s bed rest.

Craze: Loom bands can be shaped into different objects, like this ball. Despite their popularity, they have been linked with cancer, choking and circulation problems

A doctor
 has used a Facebook group to warn parents over the dangers of the 
playground craze, in which tiny bands are woven together, either using 
fingers or a special plastic loom, to make friendship bracelets.

The
 GP, from Bristol, posted a picture of a boy who had wound bands so 
tightly around two of his fingers before falling asleep that they had 
turned blue from lack of blood circulation.

Other experts have warned the bands could be a choking hazard for younger children.

And last month, the UK's biggest independent toy company removed all loom band charms from its stores after tests found they contained cancerous chemicals.

The Entertainer took the measure as it launches a full investigation into the research that detected phthalates in the rubber accessories that are sold with the bracelets.

The chemical is used to make plastics more safe and pliable but it is also a known carcinogen and its use is strictly controlled - particularly in toys that could go in the mouth.

Now, four months on, the family has been told to return to hospital in eight weeks to see if there has been any change or improvement.

Mrs Lawrence said: 'We have no idea what the impact will be on him at school and into the future.

'Kyle finds it hard to focus on 
things that are far away and when you are walking with him you need to 
hold his hand, otherwise he may walk into a lamp post.'

She
 added she is frustrated at the length of time it has take for Kyle to 
be seen by specialists and says the family will look into private 
treatment if necessary.

Her husband and Kyle's father Trevor, 37, said: 'We feel it’s been left too long. I can’t help thinking if they had told us sooner, he might have had more of a chance because his eye has got worse as time has gone on.

'It’s going to affect his future, he won’t be able to drive now and he can’t go out to play a game of football with his friends.'

In the meantime, Kyle has to continue to adjust to his new life with one eye and has been set a care plan at school.

He said: 'I do get upset that I cannot play football at school  - all I can see is lots of blurry stuff.'

Mrs Lawrence, a carer, said of the loom bands: ‘I will never have them in the house again.

‘I
 emailed the company about changing the labelling to warn people but 
they haven’t got back to me. There should be a warning on the packet – 
children shouldn’t be doing the stretching. It’s terrible that this has 
happened. I’ve had other parents come forward and say that something 
similar has happened, but not as bad.’

The loom band craze has been fuelled by their popularity among celebrities – and even royalty.

The
 Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have been photographed wearing friendship
 bracelets and they have also been spotted on the arms of David Beckham,
 presenter Fearne Cotton, Miley Cyrus and One Direction’s Harry Styles.

Loom
 bands are already the eighth best-selling toy of all time on Amazon. 
Many parents approve of them as they are more affordable than hi-tech 
toys – while a new computer game can cost £40, 1,800 loom bands can be 
bought for less than £2.50.
