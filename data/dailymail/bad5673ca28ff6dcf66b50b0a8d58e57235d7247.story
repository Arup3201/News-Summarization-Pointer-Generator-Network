Britain enjoyed its first taste of spring today with temperatures soaring to 12C in the Northeast after weeks of Siberian weather  which has seen persistent snow and sleet showers in much of the country.

Spring lambs were seen enjoying the sunshine in the Cumbria countryside and a group of jet-skiers raced each other around Hamble, Southampton, earlier today in warmer than average temperatures for February.

Forecasters have predicted that the next four days will see largely dry, settled weather with temperatures averaging around 10C for much of the country.

Temperatures soared as high as 12C in Durham, 10C in Aberdeen and parts of central Scotland and 9C along the North East cost - just a week after the mercury plummeted to -11C overnight in parts of the country.

Met Office forecaster Hannah Roberts said: 'Today it has been notably warmer than it has been in recent weeks. It was a pleasantly mild winter day.

'Temperatures were as high as 12C in Durham in the Northeast and 10C in parts of Devon including Exeter.

'The maximum average temperature for February in the East and West is between 7C and 9C, so today's temperatures are higher than average. In Scotland this is normally between 5C and 6C.'

Tomorrow is expected to be similar and largely dry in the East and West with variable cloud and sunshine.

'Northwest Scotland is the only area which could see a threat of rain tomorrow,' said Ms Roberts.

'Most other places in the country will be looking similar to today with dry weather, outbreaks of sunshine and cloud.'

Forecasters have predicted that temperatures will be in the low double figures for the rest of the week until Thursday night which could see a big change. 

'There is uncertainty for Friday and Valentine's Day,' said Ms Roberts.

The Weather Outlook said models show conditions turning much colder by Valentine’s Day, on Saturday, with low pressure building over Scandinavia.

The Met Office said the rest of the month is expected to be dry, settled weather, similar to what will be seen over the next few days. 

'High pressure will be dominating and it will be warmer than average,' said Ms Roberts.
