It could be a beautiful jungle hideaway set in the middle of a lush green rainforest. 

But this traditional Australian home is actually nestled near the Brisbane River in Queensland on a private plot surrounded by trees and is ready to open its doors to the next family. 

Being gorgeous is just not enough for this home, it is also the current dwelling of former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd and his wife Therese Rein.

Piece of luxury: The traditional Australian house has sweeping verandahs and is perfect for a family to grow into 

Relax in paradise: The rainforest inspired home has a beautiful tropical inspired swimming pool surrounded by palm trees 

Boasting a beautiful wrap-around verandah the home is perfect for entertaining all year round 

Kevin Rudd and his wife Therese Rein bought the property in 1994 from real estate agent Tim Altass who is also helping them sell it 

The five bedroom tropically inspired home is expected to sell for between $1million and $2 million based on properties which have sold in Norman Crescent, Norman Park location in the last two years. 

Agent Tim Altass told Daily Mail Australia 'you just have to look at the pictures to see why people would want it'. 

The home boasts a tropical swimming pool, wraparound north east facing verandahs described as an 'inner city oasis'. 

Mr Altass told Daily Mail Australia 'This home would be perfect for a family with teenagers, the downstairs area is perfect for it with extra big rooms and high ceilings. 

'The house really is as good as it looks, it's a beauty. 

'There will not be any shortage of interest, it's typical of what people want  with the outdoor space.

'It is in a great location with it being right near the river and you can walk to ferry or the local shops, it's only about 3km out of the CBD. 

'The privacy and the size of the home is what really sets it apart from other homes in the area. 

'The house is very green and has extra high ceilings and it has just been done in a really lush setting.

Great living areas: One of the best features of the home is the space it offers according to Mr Altass

The house, which is ready to move into, offers the new owners a stunning kitchen and original hoop pine polished floors

Perfect to move into: The house is expected to sell for between $1million and $2million 

The real selling point of the luxurious home is the outdoor area and the amazing gardens 

Mr Altass helped the Rudds buy the house in 1994 and also helped them with the sale of their land in Wendell Street, Brisbane. 

The couple secured $1,751,000 for the  building block that cost $1.4 million in 2011, reports Property Observer. 

It also has extra high ceilings, original hoop pine polished floors, stunning stained glass features, original fretwork and a stunning kitchen. 

Mr Rudd and his wife are understood to be relocating to their holiday home in Noosa on the Sunshine Coast.

The house is very spacious and has five bedrooms for the new owners
