Excessive credit card charges for online shopping will be banned under laws to be unveiled today.

The hidden fees, which cost customers more than £300million a year, are imposed on flights, holidays and cinema and theatre tickets as well as by a range of other retailers.

At present, firms are not allowed to put surcharges on debit card payments. Under plans drawn up by Chancellor George Osborne, that ban will be extended to all cards.

From the end of next year, almost all transactions will be covered. Companies which break the rules will be hit with multi-million pound fines.

The Government decided to act after a damning report by the Office of Fair Trading earlier this year denounced the widespread use of card scams.

It found evidence of companies using ‘drip pricing’ practices online – adding payment charges only after purchasers have filled in a number of web pages.

They include health clubs, sports and music ticketing firms and even Government agencies such as the DVLA, which distributes driving licences.

The report followed a campaign by the consumer rights group Which? It filed more than 50,000 complaints about rip-off card deals with the OFT.

From mid-2014 an EU Consumer Rights Directive will ban businesses in many sectors, including airlines, from imposing above-cost surcharges on any form of payment.

But Treasury minister Mark Hoban will
today announce a consultation to ban the practice nearly two years 
early in Britain, by the end of 2012.

Mr Hoban, the Financial Secretary to the
Treasury, said: ‘We want consumers to be able to shop around. They have
a right to understand the charges they may incur upfront and not be hit
through a hidden last-minute payment surcharge.

‘We’re leading the way in Europe by stopping this practice. The Government remains committed to helping consumers get a good deal in these difficult times.’

Ministers also want to act against excessive ‘administration fees’ imposed when people shop online for flights, holidays, concert tickets and rail travel.

For example, Ryanair imposes a £6 ‘administration fee’ on every customer for every flight, regardless of how payment is made, slapping a £12 return cost on tickets that often cost only a few pounds. This is a 1,400 per cent increase on the 80p it charged in 2004 for using a debit card.

The only way to avoid the fee is to use Ryanair’s own-brand MasterCard prepay card called Cash Passport.

Which? calculates that airline passengers pay out nearly £8million a month in surcharges every month, the equivalent of £265,000 a day.

A senior Treasury source said: ‘We want this to go as wide as we can to prevent excessive charges.’

Under the plans, businesses will not be able to load on excessive payment surcharges. But they will be able to add a small charge to cover their real costs for using any particular form of payment.

That is likely to cap credit card costs at a maximum of 2 per cent per transaction, or around 20p for a debit card payment.

Airlines regularly charge 3 or 4 per cent for credit card payments.

Ryanair: The budget airline has drawn criticism for its credit card policies, which attaches fees to most cards

Which? executive director, Richard Lloyd, welcomed the move and called for companies to act on it straight away.

He said: ‘The Government’s decision to ban rip-off debit and credit card surcharges is a huge victory for consumers. More than 50,000 people supported the Which? campaign to see these fees stamped out.

‘This announcement goes further than the Office of Fair Trading’s proposals, finally putting an end to these unfair and excessive charges.

‘Given that airline passengers alone pay more than £265,000 a day in card surcharges, businesses shouldn’t drag their feet over this. While the law will come into force at the end of 2012, we want companies to be upfront and fair over card charges today.’

The Department of Business will finalise the new rules once the consultation is complete.

Consumer Minister Edward Davey said: ‘We want to make sure that consumers paying by card do not have to pay the excessively high surcharges being imposed on them by some airlines and other businesses.

‘That is why we will consult on early implementation of the Consumer Rights Directive provision to protect consumers from excessively high credit and debit card charges.’

Ryanair made clear that it will fight Government attempts to hit its ‘administration fees’. A spokesman for the company said: ‘Ryanair, the UK’s favourite airline, confirms that it does not impose any debit or credit card fees.’
