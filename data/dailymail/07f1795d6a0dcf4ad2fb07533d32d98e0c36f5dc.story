Jose Mourinho believes Roy Hodgson's decision to play Wayne Rooney on the left wing against Italy means the striker 'loses a bit of his danger'.

The Three Lions were beaten by Italy on Saturday night in their first Group D match and Rooney failed to make an impact on the game, despite setting up a goal for Daniel Sturridge.

Speaking as Yahoo’s Global Football Ambassador, Mourinho said: 'I don’t think it is the best position for Wayne, but I think many, many times players must do sacrifices for their team and I think Wayne did well.

'I think in this moment after defeat it is quite easy and it is a normal tendency to try and find the reasons for the defeat but I think it is fair to say that the reason for the England defeat was a great Italy.

Mourinho, who tried and failed to sign the 28-year-old for Chelsea last summer, believes Rooney still played a major role in the game.

He added: 'Obviously Roy was trying to play at the same time Rooney, Sterling and Welbeck with Sturridge, and to do that somebody has to play a bit more on the side and Wayne did his job.

'He got an assist for the goal with good participation in the game. But he loses a bit of his danger because he is naturally a goalscorer when he plays more in central positions.
