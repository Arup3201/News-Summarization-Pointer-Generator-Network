Children are missing out on some of the nation’s hidden gems, with 11 per cent of under 14s having never visited a British beach.  

And it's not just the Great British seaside which youngsters are missing out on.

Research by train company First Great Western also reveals 80 per cent have never been to iconic ancient site Stonehenge, and the majority of children have never visited the Roman baths in Bath (85 per cent) or the Tower of London (73 per cent).

Beside the seaside: Children enjoy donkey rides in Somerset. A survey has revealed fewer parents are taking youngsters to UK beaches

The research revealed 65 per cent of the UK’s Generation Z – those born after the millennium – have never been beside the sea in Cornwall, and 68 per cent have never been to play in the sand in Devon.

Both destinations are home to some of Britain's best beaches, including Watergate Bay in Cornwall, Porthcressa in the Isle of Scilly and Dawlish in Devon.

One of the problems, Great Western says, is that a quarter of parents (26 per cent) now believe that overseas holidays are cheaper.

The survey showed that modern day four to 16-year-olds are missing out on traditional seaside fun.

One in three youngsters have never made a sandcastle (36 per cent) and more than half have not been crabbing (53 per cent).

Sadly, most children have never skimmed stones over the surf (52 per cent) or held a shell to their ear to listen to the sound of the sea (43 per cent).

These simple joys are now being neglected despite 69 per cent of parents fondly recalling trips to the seaside when they were children.

The good 
old British weather also plays a big part in decision-making, with 
almost half of parents (45 per cent) choosing to take kids abroad 
because of the rainy climate.

'A
 lot of individuals and families may not even know about the plentiful 
beaches, landscapes and landmarks the UK has to offer,' Philip 
Edgerton of First Great Western said.

'With
 so many of these in the south west, First Great Western wants to help 
(travellers) visit great places and get more children enjoying the 
British seaside this summer holiday.'

Working with locals across the UK, including celebrities such as Daisy and Pearl Lowe from Somerset, Rick Stein from Cornwall and Alex James from The Cotswolds, the company has launched a Facebook app to help families discover what the country has to offer this summer.

Nearly half of parents surveyed said they liked visiting castles themselves when children (45 per cent) and a third admitted having fun on camping holidays (35 per cent).

But sadly, one in eight parents (12 per cent) said they had simply 'forgotten about the good things we can do in this country'.

In addition, many now choose to go abroad in the belief it's cheaper (26 per cent) and to avoid the poor British weather (45 per cent).
