Prominent ESPN Dallas writer and baseball reporter Richard Durrett has died aged 38 from a brain aneurysm.

The journalist covered the Texas Rangers baseball team for ESPN since 2009 following his move from the Dallas Morning News.

The sudden death of the popular journalist has been met with dozens of tributes online from friends, bosses and work colleagues.

Durrett leaves behind his wife Kelly and two children, aged six and three.

The Texas Rangers released a statement saying they were 'shocked and saddened' at the news.

'Mr Durrett covered the Texas Rangers with professionalism and integrity for the last decade, first for the Dallas Morning News and more recently for ESPNDallas.com. He earned the respect of team management and field personnel for his fair and thorough coverage on the Rangers beat.'

The statement went on to describe Durrett as a 'versatile journalist' always willing to contribute to Rangers publications and radio play-by-plays during the team's spring training and regular season.

Many people described him as a nice guy, and a 'gentleman' whose only fault was being 'too nice'.

Chuck Morgan tweeted: 'Always enjoyed the writing of Richard Durrett, but enjoyed being around him even more. A good friend, thoughts and prayers for his family.'

He added: 'Richard interviewed me last Thur.(sic) he was excited that the wave messages were going on ESPN national. Fortunate to call him a friend.'

The Dallas Stars ice hockey team also offered its condolences, tweeting: 'Our thoughts and prayers go out to the family of Richard Durrett. A great writer and a great man. You will be missed.'

ESPN published a statement from its vice president and editorial director, digital and print, Patrick Stiegman, who said Durrett was extremely respected and well-liked.

'He was known for creativity and an exceptional work ethic throughout his ESPN tenure, and nearly a decade at The Dallas Morning News before that.

'He will be deeply missed by his friends, colleagues and many sports fans he enlightened every day.'
