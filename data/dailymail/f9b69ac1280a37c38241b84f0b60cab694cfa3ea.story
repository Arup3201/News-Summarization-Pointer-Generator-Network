Hull put the damp squib of 2014 behind them in spectacular fashion by running roughshod over a miserable Everton in a manner not properly reflected by the scoreline.

Ahmed Elmohamady and former Toffee Nikica Jelavic scored the first-half goals that secured the points although Hull’s star man was their Uruguayan forward Abel Hernandez, who dazzled with his best performance of the season at the heart of everything good about the hosts.

And then there was Everton; poor, sorry, shambolically defensive Everton, losing a fourth game on the bounce to leave their campaign beached if not quite mired in a relegation battle. They improved from woeful in the first half to mediocre in the second but something is badly awry in Roberto Martinez’s team and needs fixing, quickly.

Hull move up to 15th with the win

How Elmohamady opened the scoring for Hull against Everton

Hull had a peculiar 2014 to say the least, triumphant in as much as they reached the FA Cup final and retained their Premier League status, but poor for long spells, especially at home, worryingly so this season.

In the calendar year they played 18 home league games and won a pitiful three all year, and one this season. Their win-draw-loss statistics at the KC Stadium were 3-4-11, or relegation standard when it is almost inevitably a struggling team’s home form that keeps them.

They finished the year with another home reverse, 1-0 to Leicester on Sunday, and the dreadful showings at home were a large part of why they started the day hovering above the relegation zone.

Steve Bruce had responded to suggestions before the game that he was among candidates for the manager’s job at Newcastle by saying he was ‘flattered’ but ruled himself out. ‘I’m determined to see this through with Hull and make sure we stay in the Premier League,’ he said.

His first game of a new year duly began with four changes to the starting XI from the Leicester loss, with Liam Rosenoir dropped to the bench after an achilles problem, Robbie Brady and Sone Aluko both benched and Stephen Quinn injured.

In came James Chester and Andy Robertson to defence while Hernandez and former Everton front man Jelavic both returned, as the pairing up top. Rosenoir was on the field inside 23 minutes in any case, replacing Robertson, off with a hamstring pull.

Everton came into the game on the back of three straight league defeats and with just one win in seven in what is easily Martinez’s most troubling spell in charge since taking over from David Moyes in the summer of 2013.

There is a gag that is becoming a common refrain and holds no amusement for Everton supporters but it is painful because it is true: Martinez’s team is starting to defend like his leaky Wigan of old.

Five changes from the XI who started in last weekend’s 3-2 defeat to Newcastle included Sylvain Distin dropping to the bench and Luke Garbett dropping off the radar altogether. Aiden McGeady was also benched, along with Samuel Eto’o, while James McCarthy was injured.

The quintet coming in - Phil Jagielka, Muhamed Besic, Kevin Mirallas, Steven Naithsmith and Ross Barkley - did so into a rare and peculiar 3-4-1-2 that had Gareth Barry as part of a three-man defensive line with Seamus Colman and Leighton Baines on the flanks of a midfield four. 

Everton looked the livelier for all of two minutes as Besic charged down the right and set up Arouna Kone, whose cutback found nobody, and then it was pretty much Hull for most of the first half.

Bruce’s men should have had a penalty in the third minute when Barry fouled Hernandez, replays confirming it was inside the area. Instead a free-kick was given on the edge of the box as Jelavic smacked it high and over.

Hernandez then dispossessed Barkley and whipped in a shot, forcing Joel Robles into a smart pushed save. Everton had plenty of possesion and did not much with it, Mirallas’s long-range shot, high, being a case in point. The visitors also had a penalty shout when Barkley was squished by two defenders running towards the area but nothing was given and it was far from conclusive.

With Rosenoir on for Robertson and Hernandez causing all sorts of distractions, it was a matter of time before Hull made their efforts count. In the 33rd minute they did, Elmohamady outjumping Baines to meet Rosenoir’s cross with a header to the bottom right corner.

Hull were close to doubling the lead eight minutes later when Rosenoir and Hernandez combined, the latter’s shot blocked, and did double it shortly afterwards as Jelavic ran onto Hernandez’s ball over the top and lobbed Robles.

Martinez needed to change something, urgently, and he made a double change at half-time, bringing on £28m summer signing Romelu Lukaku and Bryan Oviedo. That changed the dynamic of the match, with Everton finally creating chances. Just not converting them. Lukaku had efforts missed and saved, Barkley was thwarted more than once and Naismith had a good chance blocked.

And still Hull came back, Hernandez absolutely outstanding and they pushed for more goals on this bright dawn of a new year.

Afterwards, Martinez claimed he ‘loves the pressure’ as he was forced to bat away concerns that he could be the next Premier League manager to be sacked.

Martinez insisted: ‘I know my team has quality. The reality is we are low on confidence and once the goal goes in, we are a completely different side. It’s a new year, a fresh year and (we need to) quickly turns things around.’ 

Bruce, happy to see the end of a difficult 2014, said: ‘It’s been probably our best performance.

‘We’ve seen glimpses of it but from the first minute to the 90th there was a determination that it was going to be our day.’

He was full of praise for Hernandez, whose season has been disrupted by trips to South America for international duty and the birth of his child. ‘He’s found it difficult,’ Bruce said. ‘We’ve needed to give him time. I think he’s proved what a good player he can be for us.’

Bruce confirmed he is interested in signing former England forward Jermain Defoe, 32, this month.

‘You ask any club in the bottom of the division, all of us would say “yes”,’ he added. ‘Whether we can do it financially is another problem. But if he becomes available, which I believe he is, then we’d love to do something.’
