A 75-year-old woman believes in miracles after finding an essay she wrote as a schoolgirl tucked inside a Bible she bought at a secondhand store, more than 2,000 miles away from where she grew up .

'I call it my OMG story,' Marion Shurtleff, from San Clemente, California, said after finding the essay she wrote when she was 10.

The cancer survivor is now trying to trace the original owner of the Bible, to find out what made them keep the yellowing handwritten pages for so long.

'I think there’s 
got to be a tie to the person who kept this. Why would they keep it,' 
she told CBS Los Angeles. 'Maybe it was sent to me for a reason. Maybe that 
person should be in my life.'

When Mrs Shurtleff bought the Bible she noticed the piece of paper tucked inside, but it was several months before she took a closer look.

'I opened it up, and instantly I saw my 
name,' she said. 'I recognized my handwriting. I 
hollered. I started shaking. I cried. I had goose bumps.'

The paper was an essay Mrs Shurtleff 
had written to earn her Girl Scouts 'Foot Travel' badge when she was 10 
and living in Covington, Kentucky, more than 2,000 miles from her 
present home.

In the essay,
she had promised to be kind to animals and not pick flowers. But she 
had not given a second thought to it until she recognized her 
hand writing on the paper in the Bible 65 years later.

Alongside her name was that of Bonnie Jean Edwards, who she believes may have been the troop leader, and the date May 28, 1948.

Mrs Shurtleff told KY Post she loved being a Girl Scout, and meeting her friends for the Friday meetings and campouts.

At the time she was called Mary Lou 
Hesser, a name she later changed because: 'I was being treated as this 
Southern, blonde, "Mary Lou" bimbo at every turn'.

When
the mother-of-two visited Mathom House Books in December she had not 
planned on buying a Bible, but as she left the shop she suddenly 
remembered she needed one for a study class.

'I was almost out the door when, I don't know why, I asked, "Do you have any Bibles?",' she told Orangecounty.com.

Mrs Shurtleff was offered three Bibles - and picked the one with the mysterious connection to her.

She returned to the store to ask who the original owner was but has not had any success in tracing them.

The store was able to send an email on her behalf to the person who brought the Bible in, but there was no response.

Mrs Shurtleff now plans to write a letter, which the store will forward for her, asking why the essay had been kept.

'I
want to try and find the person who had the Bible. Who would keep this?
Why? It’s just a big ‘Why’,' she said,
