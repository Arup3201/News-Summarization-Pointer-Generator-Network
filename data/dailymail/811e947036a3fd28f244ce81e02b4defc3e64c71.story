Browsing the Marks and Spencer website, Stuart Lever came across what looked like the bargain of the century – a plush reclining armchair for 50p.

The deal was so good – including free delivery and assembly – that the former Tory councillor decided to buy seven for a mere £3.50, and donate them to his local hospital.

And he wasn’t the only one who spotted the bargain, with other eagle-eyed shoppers deluging the site with orders.

Bargain: Marks & Spencer mistakenly advertised this £700 reclining chair for 50p on their website

One even tried to buy seven of the High Back Richmond recliner chairs costing a grand total of £3.50, rather than £4,900.

But
 it was all too good to be true. A technical error meant the chair 
should have had a price tag of £700, and M&S has now cancelled all 
orders and offered refunds.

Writing
 to customers, the retailer said: ‘For a short period of time on our 
website, our Richmond Highback Recliner Chair was incorrectly priced at 
50p.

‘We hope you can see this was an obvious pricing error on our part and we apologise for any inconvenience caused.’

Mr Lever, 45, who was a councillor in Bolton, said: 'I was very disappointed to hear that 
Marks and Spencer wouldn’t be going through with the order - as far as 
I’m concerned they should honour the deal without any question.

'They
 are a big company and hey should take the mistake on the chin and pay 
out, they have already confirmed that they received our order.

Mistake: Customers received this email from the company confirming their bargain purchase

'If everyone kicked up a fuss, you never know they might end up changing their minds.

'I had contacted the hospital about possibly giving the chairs to the 
maternity unit, but obviously that won’t be happening now.'

A
 Bolton Council trading standards spokesman said: ‘In cases where there 
has been a clear mistake the seller is able to reject or cancel the 
order as it was not a genuine contract.’

Eventually bosses at the high street chain realised their mistake and cancelled all orders and offered refunds.

In
 a letter to customers they said: 'We are aware that, for a short period
 of time on our website yesterday, our Richmond Highback Recliner Chair 
was incorrectly priced at 50p.

'During
 this time an order was placed for the chair on your account and we’re 
sorry to let you know that this order will not be processed further.

'We
 know that this will be disappointing for you, however, we hope you can 
see this was an obvious pricing error on our part and we apologise for 
any inconvenience caused.

'You
 will receive further emails from us today to notify you that your order
 has not been progressed and a refund processed. If your order included 
any additional items, apart from the chair, we’re afraid that you will 
have to place a new order for those items.

Apology: Marks & Spencer have now cancelled all orders and offered customers a full refund

'Once again, we do apologise for any disappointment or inconvenience caused by this.'

Initially
 on its website M&S proudly trumpeted the Richmond as being 
'supremely comfortable and supportive with the split headroll lumbar 
back cushion.

'The combination of comfort with the beautiful proportions and classic lines will make this a real future favourite.'

It added: 'Free, eco-friendly home delivery. Our crews will unpack, assemble and position the item.'

But today the chair was nowhere to be seen on the website - although other items in the same range were being offered for sale.

A Marks & Spencer spokesman said the pricing mistake was down a 'technical error' which was corrected as soon as it was spotted.

He said the chairs would not be sold at 50p and a full refund would be given.

A statement said: 'We have contacted customers and apologised for any inconvenience caused.'
