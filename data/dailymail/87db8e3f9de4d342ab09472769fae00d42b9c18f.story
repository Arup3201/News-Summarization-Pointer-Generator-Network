Aberdeen has been named the 'most dismal town' in Scotland after winning an annual award that recognises the worst-looking place in the country.

It beat out contenders including East Kilbride, South Lanarkshire, Cumbernauld, North Lanarkshire and Greenock, Inverclyde, to take the Carbuncle Award, which is handed to a town that has continually let down its residents and has fallen behind in developing for the better.

Urban Realm magazine, which administers the accolade, said Aberdeen had become the 'poor relation' of Scotland's cities, while residents and visitors slammed it as a 'grey, shambolic mess'.

Bleak: This photograph of the promenade today shows much of the shore has been paved. Experts say it has fallen behind in developing

Civilised: Union Street, pictured, was built to relieve the strain of the small cramped streets that people coming into the city had to navigate

Grey: The road, a major shopping thoroughfare, is just one example of the dreary architecture that helped earn the city the Carbuncle Award

The magazine cited planning issues surrounding Union Terrace Gardens, Marischal Square, and missing out on the 2017 City of Culture shortlist as evidence for Aberdeen deserving the award.

But Aberdeen Council chiefs hit back at the award, branding it an 'attack' on the oil-rich city's long-standing reputation.

The Carbuncle Awards are architectural prizes that have been handed out by Urban Realm magazine intermittently since 2000.  

The award categories include the Pock Mark award, for worst planning decision, the Zit Building, for Scotland's worst building, and the 'Plook on the Plinth Award' for the 'most dismal town' - 'plook' is a Scottish word for pimple.   

Public nominations are made via the magazine's website, with a small group of critics selecting the final winners.

Speaking on Aberdeen's win, Urban Realm editor John Glenday commented: 'Aberdeen is a great city but despite its enviable financial clout and rich heritage legacy it has become the poor relation of the Scottish cities.

Historic: Marischal College, which stands in the city centre, was founded in 1593. It now acts as Aberdeen City Council headquarters

Lost: The granite building now battles for space with newer buildings that reflect an 'anything goes' attitude, according to Urban Realm

Bustling: Aberdeen’s historic Green, pictured, and surroundings are among the oldest known parts of the city. Above, a market in 'the Green'

Dreary: The area is now taking up with shops, and lined with the granite buildings that give Aberdeen its name - the Granite City

'It has been left behind by the likes of Dundee, which has made huge strides to transform its waterfront. The time to turn things around is now, in a few years' time it may well be too late.'

Residents and visitors took to the internet to slam the city's architecture.  

On social networking site Reddit, one user said: 'The infrastructure of this city is shambolic and simply can't support the ever-growing population, and I'm convinced that the scale of the problem is now so daunting that no council wants to touch it.

The Carbuncle Awards are architectural prizes that have been handed out by Urban Realm magazine intermittently since 2000.

They were established following a discussion about why policy initiatives to improve the quality of the built environment seemed to be having so little impact beyond the centres of Scotland's key cities.

The name of the awards comes from a comment by Prince Charles, an outspoken critic of modern architecture, who in 1984 described Richard Rogers' proposed extension of London's National Gallery as a 'monstrous carbuncle on the face of a much-loved and elegant friend'.

The award categories include the Pock Mark award, for worst planning decision, the Zit Building, for Scotland's worst building, and the 'Plook on the Plinth Award' for the 'most dismal town'. 'Plook' is a Scottish word for pimple.

Public nominations are made via the magazine's website, with a small group of critics selecting the final winners.

'They'd rather sit on their hands, waffling on about what a great and ambitious city Aberdeen is, and hoping the next guy will deal with it instead.'

Another online user wrote: 'I remember going to Aberdeen for the first time when I was a kid, and just thinking this place is so grey.

'The buildings are grey, the road is grey, the sky was grey, everything just made me bored as a kid and I left thinking Aberdeen was dull.

'I know Aberdeen is the Granite City, but it needs some colour injected into it.'

Another added: 'When I worked in Aberdeen I used to hang around the traffic lights just so I knew I hadn't gone colour blind.' 

But the novelty award was slammed by Aberdeen City Council bosses who branded it an 'attack' on the city's long-standing reputation.

Convener of Aberdeen City Council's planning committee, Ramsay Milne, said he was disappointed by the decision.

Cllr Milne said: 'I think it's absolute nonsense how some obscure periodical has come to this decision to no discussion with the city council.

'People should stop talking down this great city and talk it up. This is disheartening, but people will have common sense with their own experience of it being a good place to live.'

Steve Harris, chief executive of VisitAberdeen, said he was pleased with the award as it has put the city into the spotlight.

He said: 'Anything that draws attention to Aberdeen can only help people realise how preposterous and ignorant its award is.

'Aberdeen is a stunning city with beautiful parks and gardens, a beach that runs for miles right into the city centre, and some stunning architecture.' 

SNP MSP Kevin Stewart labelled the decision an 'unwarranted' attack.

He said: 'The public criticism of the state of the city centre must be a wake-up call to the Labour-led administration that their inept management of the city cannot continue.

'This Carbuncle award is very unfair, but it if achieves anything, it must be to see the ludicrous Marischal Square scheme brought to a halt before the administration inflicts another disaster upon Aberdeen.'

Some residents called out the council for refusing to accept the decision.   

Commenting online, Stephen Kain wrote: 'For me the denial from the council towards all this is the single most alarming fact. Everyone with eyes can see the mess our city centre has now become, and now seems nothing will ever be the wake-up call needed for this lot.

Grim: Urban Realm magazine, which administers the accolade, said Aberdeen had become the 'poor relation' of Scotland's cities

'Only course of action left for the city will be to vote them out at next council elections.'

Debbie Kerr wrote: 'Instead of criticising this 'award' - take a step back please all councillors and see Aberdeen for what it really is - what you have been doing to the Oil Capital of Europe (or not been doing) for years. 

'For once - pay attention to the people of Aberdeen - and stop lining your own pockets!' 

The 'Pock Mark' award for worst planning decision was handed to Edinburgh City Council for demolition of the B-listed Scottish Provident Building on St Andrews Square. Edinburgh Airport's recently completed eastern terminal expansion meanwhile netted a 'Zit' accolade for Scotland's worst building.

1179: There has been a human presence in the area of Aberdeen since the Stone Age. It was first named a burgh in 1179. Initially, it was separated into Old Aberdeen - the university and cathedral settlement - and New Aberdeen, where the fishing and trading took place.  

1336: The city was burned by Edward III of England in 1336, but was soon rebuilt and extended, and called New Aberdeen. For many centuries the city was subject to attacks by the neighbouring lords, and was strongly fortified, but the gates were all removed by 1770.

1495: King's College was founded by Bishop Elphinstone and is Scotland's third oldest university. The college merged with Marischal College in 1860 to create Aberdeen University as it is known today. 

1740: Rubislaw Quarry, located at the Hill of Rubislaw in the west end of Aberdeen, was opened. It was sold some 30 years later as it was thought that the granite it produced did not work as a building material. However, over the next 200 years an estimated six million tonnes were excavated from the quarry - giving Aberdeen the nickname, The Granite City. 

1742: In the 18th century a new Town Hall was built. This century also saw the beginnings of social services for the Infirmary at Woolmanhill which was opened in 1742 and the Lunatic Asylum in 1779.

1805: Aberdeen changed rapidly from the late 1790s to the early 1800s when the council agreed that a programme of building new streets should be put into place. By 1805 George Street, King Street and Union Street were open.

1817: The construction of the new streets was expensive work, and the city faced bankruptcy in 1817. 

The growth of the shipbuilding and fishing industries in the 19th century brought a need for improved harbour facilities. During this century much of the harbour as it exists today was built including Victoria Dock, the South Breakwater and the extension to the North Pier.

1883: The first turf was laid at Duthie Park, a gift to the city to benefit the citizens of Aberdeen, this year. It was officially opened by Princess Beatrice two years later.

1943: The night of 21st April, 1943, saw the heaviest bombing to hit Aberdeen during the War. A Luftwaffe raid dropped 129 bombs on Aberdeen resulting in 125 deaths and considerable damage to the city. This event is referred to as the Aberdeen Blitz.
