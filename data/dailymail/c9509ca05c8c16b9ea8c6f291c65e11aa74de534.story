Peter Wright returned to the Alexandra Palace stage on Friday sporting his trademark loud outfit and extravagant hair style.

The 2014 World Darts Championship finalist was impressive in sweeping aside Gerwyn Price 3-0 in the first round, but his attire was even more eye-catching.

Wright sported a bright red shirt with Christmas trousers, and also had a Christmas tree shaved into his beard.

Peter Wright was in fine form on Friday night, winning his first round match 3-0 to progress

The flamboyant Wright got into the festive spirit with Christmas trousers and his trademark haircut

Wright revealed his hair, which included a Christmas tree shaved into his beard, took two and a half hours

On the left side of his blue and white spiky mohican hair cut was a shiny snake, while on the other side Wright had a mistletoe, a kiss and a Christmas tree.

Wright’s hair and outfit are chosen by his wife, Jo, and he joked that it only takes her ‘two minutes’ to perfect.

He added: ‘Today was about two and a half hours. The snake is glued on as well and it’s going to hurt to get it off. I will have to get in the shower with some really hot water and it will soften the glue up.

Gerwyn Price was no match for Wright, who sailed past his opponent without losing a set

Wright celebrates, but admitted when it comes to his outfits, it's his wife Jo making all the decisions

‘We try and change things. You can’t be the same all the time, so we like to bring something new and different. People who don’t even like me say “let’s see what that idiot looks like today”, but at least they tune in.

‘I didn’t even know what she was doing today and I haven’t got a clue about the next round either.

‘She says “sit down, don’t move and I’ll tell you when to move once it is finished”. I used to have a say, now I just shut up and do as I’m told. She wears the trousers. She’s the boss.’
