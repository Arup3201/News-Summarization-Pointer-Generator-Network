For a sport reliant on perfect timing, it could be the gymnastics schedule at the Commonwealth Games that proves the toughest test of all.

England’s Max Whitlock, one of Sportsmail’s seven athletes on the Road to Rio, is targeting success across the board in Glasgow but, if all goes to plan, he will have to compete on five straight days this week.

‘We’ve never been in a competition like it,’ says the 21-year-old. Beginning with the team event today — which ends tomorrow evening — the artistic programme will be squeezed into a schedule that allows little time for rest and recovery.

Whitlock won silver in the team event and gold in his specialist pommel horse at the European Championships in May and has designs on more medals here. But it will be a stern test.

‘It’s a lot busier than normal,’ says Whitlock. ‘Often we’ll go one day on, one day off, but it will be different here and we’ve tried to mirror that in training.

‘We always work on tidying up our routines, but we’ve done a lot of stamina work and strengthening in the gym. Thanks to my National Lottery funding, we also went to a training camp in Portugal.’ It’s not just a physical challenge — the programme will test the gymnasts’ mental strength in other ways.

‘The team final is usually competed over one day, but here it will be over two,’ says Whitlock.

‘The first event of the team final is always the most nervous of any competition, but you only have to get over it once — at the start of the day. Now we’ll have to go through it twice!’

Dan Purvis was competing alongside Whitlock for Team GB when they won team bronze at London 2012 but will bear the Scottish saltire this week. Dan Keatings, a regular competitor for Great Britain, also flies the flag for the host nation.

Whitlock says: ‘It will be strange competing against them but we’ve been training with the Scots in the build-up and there’s nothing to hide. Hopefully it will feel like a home games.’
