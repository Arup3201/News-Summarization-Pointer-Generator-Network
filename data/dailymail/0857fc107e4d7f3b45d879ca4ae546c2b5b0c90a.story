A seven-year-old boy whose desperate parents raised £550,000 to help him fight a rare childhood cancer has died.

Little Jamie Inglis, who was first diagnosed with the agressive neuroblastoma when he was three, and beat it 18 months later, was undergoing innovative treatment in Germany after suffering a relapse when he died.

Today his parents Vicky and John, who had campaigned tirelessly to raise the money needed to pay for Jamie's pioneering treatment abroad, announced via their Facebook page that he had lost his fight.

Mrs Inglis wrote on their Facebook 'Keep Jamie Smiling' page: 'Jamie is in peaceful sleep now and his fight against neuroblastoma ended on Monday at 3.45pm here in the beautiful town of Tubingen.

'We have been truly blessed to bring such an amazing child into this world.

'Neuroblastoma only seeks out the best; the best is what Jamie is.'

'I really do not know how I can express what has happened. Difficult decisions over the last 24 hours. Truly the most difficult of our lives.

'Jamie is in peaceful sleep now and his fight against neuroblastoma ended on Monday at 3.45pm Central EuropeanTime, here in the beautiful town of Tubingen.

'We have been truly blessed to bring such an amazing child into this world. Neuroblastoma only seeks out the best.

'The best is what Jamie is.

'Jamie fought with such dignity and to that end we owed him dignity at the very least.

'As his mummy, I can take comfort in knowing that the beginning of eternal sleep was completely dignified and with the advice of the remarkable team, that dignified time had arrived.

'We have nothing but complete admiration and respect for everyone involved in Jamie's care since we arrived here in Germany. The last 2 months have been the most difficult for Jamie and everyone involved but we have all done everything we can.

'The team took into account all of our wishes to every last detail which meant that eternal sleep arrived with mummy lying next to him and daddy holding his hand.

'We were so fortunate to be able to say goodbye properly. Even at the end Mummy carried on talking, telling Jamie how loved he was by everyone.

'As we had asked for all alarms on the machines to be silenced, I didn't even know Jamie had left us.

'It was so peaceful and calm but my god, nothing can prepare you. We thought we had prepared ourselves over the last 4 years but NOTHING prepares you.

'On 15th January 2013 neuroblastoma took away a Grandchild, Godson, Cousin, Nephew, Friend and ultimately our son.

'Jamie I will stay with you forever, as you will do with me and hundreds of others.

'Your smile will forever encapsulate the meaning of your life....happiness.

'As you began to leave me my darling boy, I knew that you would continue to bring and find happiness wherever you go.

'God bless you neuroblastoma Angel.

'The pain of losing you is horrendous but no more suffering for you beautiful boy.

'Lots of love and proud hugs...Mummy, Daddy and Poppy XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX'

Jamie, who lived with his parents and sister Poppy, three, in York, was given a 30 per cent chance of survival when he was diagnosed with the cancer at the age of three.

The family embarked on a massive fund-raising campaign to raise £400,000 for antibody treatment in the U.S., which gave Jamie 18 cancer-free months, during which time he started school.

But in March last year, he relapsed.

His family were told that the only treatment options open to him at Leeds General Infirmary were chemotherapy and radiotherapy.

Doctors said that Jamie's chances of fighting off the cancer for a second time were slim because chemotherapy weakens the immune system, leaving it incapable of fighting the disease.

Then Jamie's parents found out about a new treatment being trialled at the University of Tubingen, near Stuttgart, which involved stem cells from a healthy parent being injected into the patient to boost their immune system.

Doctors there said the treatment might increase his survival chances by up to 75 per cent, but Jamie's local primary care trust wouldn't fund the treatment as it was still being trialled, so his  parents decided to embark on a second fund-raising effort.

Mr Inglis, who was an environmental health technician with the Royal Medical Corps for 22 years before giving up his job to spend more time with his children, said: 'If it makes a difference to your child, it's your duty as a parent to do it.'

Jamie's plight had already touched the nation, and Mail readers were among thousands who dug deep to help the family get him to Germany for the treatment.

One well-wisher even donated the use 
of a private plane because Jamie's immune system was too fragile for him
to be able to use commercial aeroplanes.

And celebrity chef Jamie Oliver 
expressed his support for the family, asking his two million Twitter 
followers to contribute to the campaign.

He said: 'You just look at his parents in admiration and wish them all the very best.

'Little Jamie is gorgeous beyond belief.'

Jamie began the treatment in Germany last autumn, and his parents shuttled to and from their home in York between bouts of treatment and consultations.

But tragically, the youngster developed complications, and finally lost his fight on Monday afternoon with his parents by his side.

Thousands of well-wishers posted messages on Jamie's Facebook page after reading the announcement by Mrs Inglis.

One wrote: 'Vicky and John truly amazing, unbelievable and dignified parents of an amazing and truly courageous and brave hero.'

Another wrote: 'I couldn't get to the end of this post without tears uncontrollably streaming from my eyes... I cannot begin to imagine what you and your family are going through.

'Sending lots of love and hugs... RIP Jamie xxx'
