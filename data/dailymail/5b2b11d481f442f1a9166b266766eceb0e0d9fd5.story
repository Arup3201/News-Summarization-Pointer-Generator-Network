A fugitive who hid under floorboards when police came looking for him blew his cover when he sneezed. 

Darius Olewski, 49, was on the run for dodging tens of thousands of pounds in child maintenance payments. 

To make a quick escape if police came knocking at his door, he dug a 6ft deep hole under a table in the hallway of his home in Pruszkow, Poland, and covered it with a panel to match the rest of the wooden floor.

But when officers raided the home and found it empty, they were surprised when they heard a stifled sneeze. 

'At first we couldn't work out where it came from', said one officer.

'Then we heard another one and realised it was coming from right under our feet.

'After a bit of tapping and testing we found a hollow spot and he was down there covered in cobwebs.

'Maybe if he'd dusted more often he'd still be on the run,' he added.

Blown it: Olewski was only caught after he let out a sneezing leading police to where he was hiding
