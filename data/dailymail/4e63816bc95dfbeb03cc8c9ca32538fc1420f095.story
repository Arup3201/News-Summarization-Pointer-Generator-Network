Jose Mourinho moved a stage closer to the first cup he won in English football, then scotched talk of winning four trophies.

A 3-1 win at Derby put Chelsea into the semi-finals of the Capital One Cup but Mourinho said: ‘You spoke a few weeks about being unbeatable in the Premier League - we never did it. Now you speak about a quadruple but we must keep our feet on the ground.’

Mourinho, who won this competition in 2005, insisted Monday’s match at Stoke was his only consideration. He said: ‘We can win on Monday. But it will be difficult. We don’t chose competitions, the next match is the most important thing.’

Mourinho also expressed frustration that medical staff carrying a stretcher did not reach Kurt Zouma quicker as he lay on the floor following a head collision with Petr Cech.

Zouma will be available for Monday despite his injury. ‘He was just a bit dizzy,’ said Mourinho. ‘The stretcher-carriers came out walking. When a player is injured and the body language is that he has to go out I feel a bit frustrated.

‘The people with the stretcher want to help and if they didn’t run I have to believe that is the instruction they have.’

Derby manager Steve McClaren was incensed that Jake Buxton was sent off in the 78th minute for pulling down Loic Remy, claiming his side were denied a chance to mount a late comeback with the score at 2-1.

The former England manager said: ‘The disappointing thing is that we were robbed of the last 15 minutes. It is a big decision, a poor decision. It was six and two-threes, typical tussle between centre half and centre forward.

‘I’m so proud of the players, we grew into the game. We restricted Chelsea to very few chances.’

In the night’s other quarter-final tie, League One Sheffield United knocked out Premier League Southampton with a 63rd-minute winner from Marc McNulty.

Meanwhile, League One Yeovil secured an FA Cup third-round tie at home to Manchester United after beating Accrington 2-0.

Yeovil manager Gary Johnson said: ‘There is no greater prize, it’s a game against probably the world’s biggest team.’
