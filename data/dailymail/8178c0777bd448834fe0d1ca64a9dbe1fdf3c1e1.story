Guilty: The 76-year-old media mogul wasn't in the courtroom for the verdict on the case stemming from dealings in his Mediaset business empire

Former Italian prime minister Silvio 
Berlusconi was yesterday sentenced to four years in jail for tax fraud –
only for his sentence to be immediately cut.

The 76-year-old’s prison term was 
swiftly reduced to one year because of a 2006 amnesty law aimed at 
reducing prison overcrowding.

However, legal experts said last 
night that, because of his age and Italy’s lengthy appeals process, it 
is unlikely that he will spend any time behind bars.

Berlusconi and four others,  
convicted for their part in what judge Edoardo D’Avossa described as a 
‘significant tax evasion’, were also fined ten million euros.

In addition, the billionaire media tycoon was banned from public office for five years.

The 76-year-old billionaire businessman, who was among 11 defendants on trial, is expected to remain free until the appeals process is exhausted. In Italy, cases must pass two levels of appeal before the verdicts are final.

The conviction was the media mogul's 
first in a career seemingly dogged by criminal probes and trials that have all ended in acquittal or were 
thrown out after time ran out to prosecute.

Just last week, he appeared in the same courthouse for another trial in which he is accused of paying for sex with an under-age teenager and then trying to cover it up.

Scroll down for a timeline of Berlusconi's previous brushes with the law.

Sentenced: Judge Edoardo D'Avossa reads out the sentence today in a decision that capped a trial in which Berlusconi was accused of masterminding a scheme to illegally inflate the price paid for television rights

But today, the media mogul wasn't in
the courtroom for the verdict, which comes two days after he announced he will not run in Italy's upcoming elections.

Instead, his lawyers denounced the verdict in a statement as 'absolutely incredible'.

Prosecutors allege the defendants were 
behind a scheme to purchase the rights to broadcast U.S. movies on 
Berlusconi's private television networks through a series of offshore 
companies and had falsely declared the payments to avoid taxes. 

Prosecutors further alleged the 
inflated the price for the TV rights of some 3,000 films as they 
relicensed them internally to Berlusconi's networks, pocketing the 
difference amounting to around €250million (£200million).

Other
charges of false accounting and false statements in financial reports 
were thrown out because the statute of limitations expired.

The three-time premier stepped down 
last November after Italy came under mounting market pressure to deal 
with its high debt load and Berlusconi failed to come up with persuasive
financial reforms.

Berlusconi's
designated political heir as the head of the center-right party he 
leads, Angelino Alfano, blasted the verdict Friday as 'incomprehensible'
and said he was confident an appeals court would throw out the 
conviction.

Berlusconi is not the first former Italian premier to be convicted of criminal charges.

Former Socialist Premier Bettino 
Craxi (pictured) eluded an arrest warrant and turned up at his villa in Tunisia in 
1994 after a court in Italy charged him in a massive corruption case.

He was tried in absentia, convicted 
and sentenced to 8 1/2 years in prison, never returned to Italy and died
in exile. Craxi was considered Berlusconi's mentor thanks to his 
opening to private television in Italy from a state monopoly.

Former
seven-time Christian Democrat premier, Giulio Andreotti, was convicted 
of involvement in a Mafia-murder. But he was cleared on appeal and never
went to jail

In this 
and other cases against him, Berlusconi has described himself as the 
innocent victim of prosecutors he contends sympathize with the left.

Indeed, in 2009, he described himself as ‘the most persecuted person in the entire history of the world’.

Up
until now, other criminal investigation probes against him on charges 
including corruption had ended in acquittal or were thrown out for 
statute of limitations.

Of
the other defendants, three were acquitted, including a close associate
of Berlusconi, Fedele Confalonieri, chairman of Mediaset. Berlusconi 
and three others were convicted, including a Hollywood producer, Frank 
Agrama, who received a three-year sentence.

Berlusconi,
along with other defendants convicted in the case, must deposit a total
of €10 million (£8million) into a court-ordered fund as appeals, which 
could take years, proceed.

The
trial began in July 2006, but was put on hold by a now-defunct immunity
law that shielded the Berlusconi from prosecution while he was premier 
until it was watered down by the constitutional court. The trial also 
faced delays as Berlusconi cited conflicts with his schedule as premier.

Berlusconi has been tried numerous times for his business dealings.

He has always denied wrongdoing and alleged that the cases were politically motivated.

In each case to date, he has been cleared or seen the statute of limitations expire.

The
statute of limitations in this case is set to expire sometime next 
year. In Italy, cases must pass two levels of appeal before the verdicts
are final.

Berlusconi also is on trial in Milan on charges of paying for sex with an under-age teenager and trying to cover it up.

Troubles ahead: The conviction was the media mogul's first in a career seemingly dogged by criminal probes and trials that have all ended in acquittal or were thrown out after time ran out to prosecute

Trials and accusations: Mr Berlusconi, now 76, is accused in another trial of paying to have sex with Karima El-Mahroug in 2010 when she was 17

Appearing in court last Friday, he said he believed the then 17-year-old
dancer, Karima ‘Ruby the Heartstealer’ El Mahroug, was really 24 when 
he was alleged to have paid her for sex in 2010.

Mr
Berlusconi told the court that ‘nothing vulgar or scandalous’ had ever 
occurred during parties at his villa in Acore, and that the now 
notorious phrase ‘bunga bunga’ stemmed from a joke someone had made.

He said prosecution claims that the 
evenings were orgies in which he paid prostitutes dressed as nuns to 
perform strip shows had been made up to discredit him.

He
also denied having had sex with Miss El Mahroug, who is Moroccan, or 
any of the guests at his parties, adding: 'Everything happened in front 
of staff and, at times, my children came in to say "hello"'.

But
several guests have already testified how strippers performed and money
was exchanged for sex. Mr Berlusconi also insisted he was innocent of 
abuse of office.

Prosecutors
say he lied to the police in May 2010, telling them Miss El Mahroug was
the granddaughter of the then Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak in order
to have her released after she was held for suspected theft.

Denials: Ms El-Mahroug who is widely known as Ruby Rubacuori ('heart-stealer') has always denied having sex with the prime minister when she was 17 - or being a prostitute

The list of witnesses named by Berlusconi are a roll call of the rich and famous and are said to have been guests at one of Mr Berlusconi's parties.

They include Real Madrid footballer Cristiano
Ronaldo, Hollywood star George Clooney and his girlfriend, and the 
Italian model and TV star Elisabetta Canalis.
