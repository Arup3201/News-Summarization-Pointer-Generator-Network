Benefits Street star White Dee will NOT face an investigation into her finances despite public anger over her high-profile holiday in Magaluf.

The most famous resident of Birmingham's James Turner Street has come in for fierce criticism after she was seen partying in the Spanish resort - despite claiming she's too depressed to work.

Her agent Barry Tomes has now insisted she is not under investigation over the four-day trip and could go away every month to help combat her depression.

White Dee, who starred in the Channel 4 documentary Benefits Street, is not being investigated by the Department of Work and Pensions despite being pictured on holiday in Magaluf, her agent has said

Dee - who gets around £200 a week in state support - could now make more trips abroad to help her depression

It was claimed earlier this week that
 Dee - real name Diedre Kelly - could be questioned by officials over whether her financial 
or medical circumstances had changed since the Channel 4 show.

The mother of two, who is said to receive around £200 a week from 
the state, was pictured downing shots and clutching bottles of champagne
 while on a trip to Majorca last week.

But
 Mr Tomes told the Daily Star he and Dee are in constant contact with 
the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) and 'have recieved no 
correspondence from them whatsoever'.

Mr Tomas was also quoted by The Sun saying his client is now planning trips to France and Spain to raise her mood.

The paper said he told her: 'I'm taking you on holiday every month until you conquer your depression.'

The 42-year-old told the TV programme she has been left too depressed to work since her mother died

She was pictured sipping cocktails and lying on sun-loungers in the beach resort last week

During
 the controversial documentary Benefits Street, Dee said she had 
suffered from depression since her mother died and has 'good days and 
bad days' with the condition.

Since returning from holiday, she has denied downing £500 bottles of champagne and insisted she ‘f****** hated the stuff’.

Mr Tomes told MailOnline earlier this 
week: ‘Dee has been back in the UK since Saturday. Dee had lots of fun 
as the many pictures show.

‘She missed the children [and] she 
hates flying, but she understands why we are trying to get her active to
 help us decide the suitability for some projects we would like her to 
undertake in the future.

‘She is not on Job Seekers’ Allowance 
as reported - she is on [Employment and] Support Allowance. We have been
 in touch with the benefits agency since we started to represent Dee in 
February.’

It is now said the single mother-of-two will not face a quiz from benefits officials

She may be too depressed to work, but that didnt stop White Dee partying hard on holiday in Magaluf

The Department 
for Work and Pensions has refused to comment on her case directly, but 
was prompted to mount a fresh defence of its welfare plans following 
anger at her holiday.

A
 DWP Spokesman said: 'We are reforming disability benefits by 
introducing a new face-to-face assessment and regular reviews for 
Disability Living Allowance - something missing under the old system.

'We
 are also re-assessing people on incapacity benefits to see what work 
they can do - with the right support - rather than just writing them off
 on sickness benefits as happened in the past.

'Our welfare reforms will ensure that support goes to those who need it most.'

There
 is no suggestion Dee has broken the rules, but since starring in Benefits Street she has appeared on TV several times
 and been linked with a string of new jobs including standing as an MP 
and becoming a TV chef.

The Benefits Street star was spotted enjoying an all-expenses-paid, mid-week trip to Majorca

Dee is now back in her council house on Birmingham's James Turner Street after returning from the holiday

This week she took to Facebook to deny claims that she drank 
champagne while on her holiday.

Dee, 42, said: ‘I’m 
turning into Jesus - making cloudy lemonade turn into booze. You gotta 
love the press haha.’ And, responding to a supportive comment, she 
added: ‘F****** hate the stuff hun haha.’

Mr Tomes has insisted she was not paid for going on the trip and told the Mail how she was currently 
considering an offer to front a new cookery show.

‘What many people don’t know about Dee is that she is an amazing cook and has been offered her own cookery show,’ he said.

He
 added that she has had seven offers from production companies in total,
 including from BBC, ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5, as well as three 
separate record deals, but has had to turn them down because she is ‘too
 unwell’.

‘It is like a 
light switch goes off when you are with her, sometimes she’s fine but 
then suddenly her whole mood will change and there’s nothing you can 
do,’ he said of her condition.

‘She could easily earn half a million from one of these, but she doesn’t want to at the moment.’
