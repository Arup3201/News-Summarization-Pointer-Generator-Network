A  medic who sexually assaulted three women while pretending to perform medical assessments has been jailed.

John Franklin, of Sittingbourne, Kent, asked his teenage victim if he could perform a medical assessment on her in his private ambulance as part of his training. 

But the 39-year-old, who was a member of St John Ambulance, then carried out internal examinations and touched her intimately, a court heard.

Franklin was charged by Kent Police and was convicted of two counts of assault by penetration in February after a jury heard evidence from medical experts that none of these acts were necessary or should have formed part of his training.

But the jury could not reach a verdict on four other counts relating to other victims; three of sexual assault and one of rape.

Franklin was found guilty of sexually assaulting two women on the Urban Blue Bus in Maidstone between 2011 and 2012 following a retrial last month.

He was acquitted of one count of rape and one of sexual assault dating from 1996.

He was jailed for a total of eight years for the four offences of which he was convicted at Maidstone Crown Court.

Detective Inspector Neil Kimber, of Kent Police, said: 'I'm glad that together with the Crown Prosecution Service and commitment of the victims we were able to bring Franklin back to court to face a retrial on four serious allegations that were outstanding from his previous trial.

'His victims bravely came forward and reported these violations and it is important for them to see justice being served with the substantial sentence that has been passed. 

'I would like to thank the victims for their bravery and commitment and hope that they will be able to rebuild their lives now that this sentence has imposed.

'If anyone has been the victim of a sexual assault I would encourage them to report it. 

'They will get our full support through any subsequent investigation and we will support you fully throughout the process.'

A spokesperson from St John Ambulance said: ‘St John Ambulance was appalled to hear of the actions and abuse of trust of Mr Franklin and our thoughts go to those affected by his crimes. 

'Mr Franklin resigned from the organisation in 2011 and his membership was terminated.’
