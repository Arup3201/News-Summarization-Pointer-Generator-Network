A man had to be rescued by helicopter after he slipped while trying to rescue his dog and got stuck on rocks above pounding waves.

The RNLI had to call in the air sea rescue helicopter to airlift the man to safety after the man became trapped on rocks at Porthcothan, north Cornwall, and lifeboat crew decided the safest option was to rescue him from the air.

The man suffered only minor injuries in the fall, while his dog survived unscathed after making its own way back to the beach without any help.

RNLI lifeguard Joe Avery was first on scene yesterday and passed the man who has not been named, a rescue tube to hold on to.  Cliff rescue teams from Newquay and Padstow were also scrambled.

The helicopter winched down a crew member to the rocks, and the dog owner was airlifted to a nearby field.

RNLI supervisor Adrian Mayhew said: 'Thankfully, despite the distance of the fall, the man had only minor injuries.

'Amazingly the dog was absolutely fine, and had actually made his way to the beach on his own.'

He added: 'Conditions today were fairly benign, with neap tides and only a little swell. 

'So although there was too much water movement around the rocks to take him off that way, it wasn't too great.

'Had it been any different, it might have been a difficult situation for everyone involved.' 

The RNLI were first on the scene but decided that given the nature of the tide, an air rescue was the best option
