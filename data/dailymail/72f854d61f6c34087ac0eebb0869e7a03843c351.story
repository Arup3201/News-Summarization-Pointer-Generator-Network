One of Britain’s most shocking hospital scandals in which dementia patients died after cruel abuse by nurses is exposed today. Elderly patients at an NHS hospital were left covered in faeces, injured themselves crawling on urine covered floors and were physically restrained with tables and chairs.

Nurses threatened and swore at them, left them naked and taunted them about their past love lives.

Hospital chiefs ignored repeated protests by relatives but were forced to act after a recording on a mobile phone camera smuggled into the hospital proved they were telling the truth.

The recording – the explosive contents of which have been obtained by this newspaper following an in-depth investigation – shows that nurses at a patient care meeting:

An independent report into the scandal, including extracts from the recording, has been sent to police, health chiefs and Government Ministers. One senior figure who has seen it said: ‘It is the most shocking document I have ever read.’

The report says there was ‘institutional abuse’ and suggests a number of patients died as a direct result.

Relatives’ harrowing accounts of the horrific maltreatment of loved ones were backed up by NHS whistleblowers who witnessed the abuse but had been too scared to speak out, until now.

The new scandal centres on the Tawel Fan dementia ward of the Glan Clwyd Hospital in Rhyl, North Wales. The ward was closed last year, when patients were transferred and some staff suspended.

An independent inquiry was ordered by the Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board (BCUHB) which runs the hospital, and as a result of that, police were called in earlier this month to investigate.

The BCUHB said it was ‘truly sorry to have let patients and their families down so badly.’ Chairman Peter Higson said the ‘deeply disturbing allegations’ would be ‘thoroughly investigated.’

Det Insp Lisa Surridge of North Wales police said they would study ‘documents and other material to establish evidence of criminality’.

Under new laws announced after the Mid-Staffordshire care scandal, doctors and nurses found guilty of ‘wilful neglect’ face a prison sentence of up to five years.

Welsh Secretary Stephen Crabb last night called on the Labour-run Welsh Government, which runs hospitals in the Principality to ‘get a grip’. He said: ‘I am shocked and appalled that this should have been going on in an NHS hospital in Wales. The scale of neglect and unprofessionalism uncovered is deeply troubling.

‘The Welsh Health Minister in Cardiff needs to get a grip on this and ensure that failings like this simply cannot happen again in Wales. The people of Wales deserve the very best of the NHS.’

The expose is the latest in a series of scandals concerning the appalling treatment of dementia patients in which clandestine recordings have been used to reveal the truth.

Until now, most have involved care homes, some of which are run privately. The Glan Clwyd scandal is the first major dementia expose in an NHS hospital where a hidden camera has been involved.

It comes a week after health watchdogs the Care Quality Commission said nine in ten care homes and hospitals in the UK fail dementia patients. A separate CQC report on Friday said that four in ten NHS hospitals were unsafe.

A long-term Mail on Sunday investigation into Glan Clwyd provides new, and arguably the most graphic evidence of the appalling – and in some cases fatal – abuse of vulnerable elderly people in the NHS.

The key role played by the mobile phone recording will intensify a growing debate about the use of hidden cameras to protect people in hospitals and old people’s homes. The CQC said last week it plans guidelines for relatives who want to use them spy on NHS staff.

The Glan Clwyd camera, smuggled in after complaints of abuse had been brushed aside, recorded a nurses’ shift ‘handover’ meeting, where the new shift is briefed on patients, and developments or incidents. The secret recording shows foul-mouthed nurses treating patients and relatives with contempt. One shouted: ‘Don’t you f***ing dare’ at an agitated elderly man.

Others referred to a patient having a ‘f*** of a bruise’ and his ‘whole a*** cheek’ being swollen.

Another said a patient’s wife ‘doesn’t give two f***s. I spent hours managing [her husband’s] pain.’ One female nurse talked of ‘shagging’.

The independent report says the recording shows staff displayed a ‘lack of compassionate care, used coarse language extensively and were completely unprofessional in their attitude to and description of vulnerable patients.’ Saying ‘don’t you f***ing dare’ to a patient was unjustified aggression.

When the nurses found out about the secret recording, they glibly expressed their outrage on open Facebook pages and in text messages, claiming their ‘human rights’ had been breached.

The report says one male patient had ‘a painful and swollen elbow due to constantly crawling on dirty floors where other patients had urinated and had their bowels opened.’

Nurses laughed at the daughter of that patient when he choked on ice cream. The daughter says in the report: ‘I said, “Oh my god, he’s choking.” The response was, “Don’t be so bloody silly, tell your daughter she’s being stupid.”

The patient was moved to a nursing home but the report suggests the hospital’s failure to treat his problem with swallowing, or tell the nursing home about it, may have been fatal. He died shortly after arriving in the home and the death is the subject of an investigation.

A grief-stricken relative said: ‘It’s too late for our brother, but while I have breath in my body I will fight to stop anyone else suffering the way he did on that ward.’

Many relatives complained patients were covered in urine and faeces – and that staff refused to wash them. One said: ‘I told a senior nurse staff were mopping up urine off the floor with patients’ own towels. She said she’d come and speak to me, but she didn’t.’

Relatives of an incontinent woman said: ‘She was frequently very smelly – we constantly asked why wasn’t she bathed daily – they said they were too busy.’

Another family said the smell of their relative was ‘so horrendous we couldn’t sit by him. We asked them to wash him and they brought him back with faeces down his leg. We had to get baby wipes and do it ourselves.’

The British Medical Association warned last month that the NHS in Wales faced ‘imminent meltdown’

Two daughters were horrified to find their father naked on the floor, having slipped on a pool of urine.

A daughter was shocked to find her father with his ‘head cut and a flap of skin hanging down.’ She said: ‘I was told it had been caused by dad banging his head against a wall with his glasses on.’

One visitor reported a patient ‘wandering around the garden with her bottom on display,’ adding: ‘When I informed two nurses sitting in the TV lounge, they did not look at me or speak.’ Another relative said: ‘As the number of patients went up, fractures, black and blue faces, arms and legs went up.’

A nurse recalls seeing a patient ‘slapped’ by a colleague – as other staff turned a blind eye. Senior medics tried to cover it up.

An NHS whistleblower said a senior doctor barked at her: ‘I don’t want any more complaints landing on the desk, you know what I mean?” After a heated row, the whistleblower made a formal complaint – and was accused of ‘overreacting.’

The report concludes: ‘The culture on the ward resulted in institutional abuse.'

BMA: NHS in Wales faces ‘meltdown’

The British Medical Association (BMA) warned last month that the NHS in Wales faced ‘imminent meltdown’ costing patients’ lives, with waiting times at record levels, death rates outstripping the rest of the UK and ambulance and GP services in crisis.

The health service in Wales is separate from NHS England and is run by the Labour-controlled Welsh Assembly, which has been accused of making cuts of £500million.

The BMA called for an urgent independent inquiry after it emerged that the service has failed to meet A&E waiting targets for the last five years, while waiting times for cancer treatment are far longer than in England.

In August, more than 1,000 patients had to wait at least 12 hours to be seen by a doctor in A&E, up 25 per cent in a month.

The BMA’s Dr Phil Banfield said: ‘The NHS in Wales is facing imminent meltdown. It is time for an urgent independent review.’

A Welsh Assembly spokesman denied the ‘meltdown’ claim and said: ‘The majority of people receive excellent care.’
