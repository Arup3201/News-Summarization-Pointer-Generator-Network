Tracey Tompkins, mother of tragic schoolgirl Hannah Smith, held a teenager captive for four hours

The mother of a 14-year-old schoolgirl who killed herself after being targeted by internet bullies, held a teenager captive for four hours during which she stabbed him and threatened to slit his throat.

Tracey Tompkins told terrified Niall Hirrell she would put him in a body bag and bury him at Gilroes Cemetery, Glenfield, Leics, where 'nobody would find him'.

At the end of his four-hour ordeal, Niall, who has learning difficulties, was forced to walk the streets naked and bleeding from multiple injuries.

The attack happened six months before 
Tompkins' 14-year-old daughter, Hannah Smith made national headlines 
when she committed suicide after being targeted by internet trolls.

The two incidents are not related, but Hannah's death was mentioned during her mother's sentencing at Leicester Crown Court.

The
hearing was told that Tompkins, high on a cocktail of drink and drugs, 
punched, head-butted, kicked and knifed 19-year-old Niall during a row 
over £60.

The victim was so traumatised he has since twice undergone in-patient psychiatric treatment.

James
Bide-Thomas, prosecuting, said that the background to the case began on
February 10 when Niall, now 20, helped Tompkins' brother move out of 
his flat.

In doing so, they threw some items out of a window but, in the process, a window was broken in the flat below.

That
led to an argument with the tenant and the police were called, but it 
was decided that Tompkins, her brother and Niall would each pay £20 to 
cover the cost of the window and avoid prosecution.

Two days later, Niall was at the new flat of the people he had helped move, in South Wigston.Tompkins was also there.

At 8pm, she cornered Niall in the kitchen, closing the door behind her, demanding he immediately stump up the full £60.

He sent a number of texts and made desperate calls on Tompkins' phone, asking family and friends for £60 but without success.

Mr
Bide-Thomas said she then punched him in the face, head-butted him and 
kicked him - and started threatening him with more serious harm.

Mr
Bide-Thomas said: 'She grabbed a kitchen knife and put his hands on a 
cutting board, proceeding to run the blade along the top of his hands, 
cutting him.

'She said she was going to stab him. He had a number of wounds to his side, arms and the back of his head.'

After an ordeal which lasted four hours, Tompkins told Niall she would kill him, put him in a body bag and bury him in Gilroes cemetery - 'where no-one will find you'.

The court heard she took his mobile phone, removed the SIM card and smashed it.

Mr Bide-Thomas added: 'She made him strip naked, took him to the front door and poked him in the back with the knife, telling him to go.

'He got a bin bag and walked to a Tesco, where they initially thought he was drunk but then found he was hysterical.'

Battered and covered in bruises, he was too scared to tell the truth at first, because Tompkins had earlier held a knife to his lips, calling him a 'grass'.

He at first claimed to have been robbed, said Mr Bide-Thomas.

In a victim impact statement, Niall said he could not understand why he was 'so badly treated for £60'.

The court was told Tompkins' criminal record dates back to 1996, when she was prosecuted for common assault.

In 1997, she committed four offences of causing actual bodily harm (ABH) and two thefts.

In 2001, she was dealt with for ABH and battery, between 2002 and 2007 she committed dishonesty offences and there was a public order offence in 2007.

In February this year - just three days before she attacked Niall - she was given a community order for a racially aggravated public order offence.

Richard Holloway, mitigating, said Tompkins had failed to appear in court for her scheduled sentencing on September 27 due to heroin addiction, but later surrendered after going 'cold turkey'.

Mr Holloway said: 'She realises her actions were awful. She'd taken strong lager and a mixture of prescribed and non-prescribed drugs when she committed them. She'd got this completely out of proportion.'

Mr Holloway said Tompkins did not go to Hannah's funeral 'as she was stopped by other relatives, and deeply regrets that'.

He said Tompkins was concerned about her 16-year-old daughter - Hannah's older sister, Jo - who found Hannah following her death in August, 'and wants to be as much support as she can'.

The hearing was told Tompkins separated from the girls' father years ago.

Senior probation officer John Pugh told Judge Michael Pert QC that Tompkins 'says she owes it to her (deceased) daughter and to her 16-year-old daughter to sort her life out'.

Tompkins, of St Saviour's Road, North Evington, Leicester, admitted blackmail, by demanding money with menaces, and wounding.

She was given a merciful two-year jail sentence, suspended for two years, with one year's supervision and a drug rehabilitation requirement.

Judge Pert said: 'You subjected the victim to a lengthy ordeal to get money out of him.

'On the other hand, I've read about you and heard of circumstances that are very sad.

'If you fail the court's order, you will go to prison.'
