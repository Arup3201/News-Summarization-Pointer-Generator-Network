The U.S. military's first hybrid airship took off on its maiden voyage last week, hovering above New Jersey in a successful test flight.

The Long Endurance Multi-Intelligence Vehicle (LEMV), a hybrid blimp that has been in development for years, took off on August 7 - and stayed in flight for about 90 minutes.

The vehicle is largely based on the Sky Cat, an advanced airship design refined over decades by British engineering firm Hybrid Air Vehicles Ltd (HAV).

Airtime: The LEMV hovered in the sky above Lakehurst, New Jersey, for about 90 minutes on August 7

While it gets its lift from the 
lighter-than-air helium, multiple engines on board sustain flight and 
allow it to move while gathering information from the ground.

The helium-filled aircraft was conceived by a team of British and U.S. engineers with the goal of benefitting troops on the ground with valuable surveillance information.

Based at Cardington in Bedfordshire, HAV is a specialist in hybrid air vehicles, which fly using a combination of aerostatic and aerodynamic lift.

The team at Hybrid Air Vehicles has re-examined the basic principles behind Lighter-Than-Air Science and applied modern technology and materials to this 100 year old concept.

The construction of the LEMV was a joint project between HAV and US defence firm Northrop Grummon.

The radical reimagining of an airship has four propulsion units, and can be piloted into remote areas.

'Some ten years ago we built a 50 foot prototype and at some stage demonstrated this to a delegation of the US Department of Defence,' said HAV's  Business Development Director Hardy Giesler.

'They were impressed and a few years later released a request for a long endurance surveillance vehicle, the requirements of which we are able to meet.

'Since surveillance programmes consist of multiple parts (vehicle as platform, a selection of sensors to provide the data and an ongoing service provision to manage & maintain the vehicle, as well as turn data into intelligence) we decided to team with Northrop Grumman.'

The design can land on almost any surface - even snow capped mountains.

The major new aircraft was built in just over 24 months since contract signature. 

Giesler told MailOnline that 80 per cent of the total cost of the vehicle was sourced in the UK.

'That is something Hybrid Air Vehicles is very proud of,' he added.

The LEMV, which looks like a football but is as large as a football field, isn't your grandfather's military airship.

The aircraft boasts a ton of high-tech gear to compliment the massive helium filled blimp, including sensors to beam information to troops on the ground, and to move heavy equipment.

The airship is based on a design that could eventually be used around the world as a freight and passenger

It also has endurance, and can stay afloat above a battlefield or insurgent hotspot for up to 21 days - at a fraction of the cost of other military options.

In a statement, the U.S. Army said the LEMV 'is intended to be used to conduct long-term intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance, or ISR, and persistent stare-type missions, and can also be used as a communications relay.'

Developed by: Hybrid Air Vehicles Ltd and Northrop Grummon

Top altitude: About 22,000 feet

Flight sustainability: Up to 21 days

Speed: About 92 miles per hour

The LEMV, which took off from New Jersey’s Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst base, was piloted for the test flight, but has the ability to function as an unmanned vehicle.

It can float at an altitude of about 22,000 feet, and can travel at about 92 mph.

The LEMV’s strong skin - a blend of Vectran, Kevlar and Mylar - can endure a reasonable amount of small arms fire from enemies on the ground.

The construction of the LEMV was a joint project by British engineering firm Hybrid Air Vehicles Ltd and U.S. defence firm Northrop Grummon.

Lakehurst, where the LEMV took flight, is no stranger to airships. The base is also the site where the Hindenburg crashed in 1937.

The Army says it will conduct more flights after the craft undergoes an inspection.
