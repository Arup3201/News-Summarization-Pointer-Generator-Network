In 1820, a landslide on Washington’s Camano Island sent a 4m (13ft) wave into nearby Hat Island, destroying homes and drowning many of the local people.

Now one designer has created a concept house that allows water to flow through it, in an attempt to protect existing residents from the same fate.

The 3,140 square-foot house is located on the northern end of the island and is the work of architect Dan Nelson of Designs Northwest Architects.

Located on Camano Island in Washington State, the Tsunami House was built by Designs Northwest Architects

The Tsunami House is 9m (30 ft) tall. Its two floors are situated 2.7m (9ft) high.

These floors are supported by a steel frame and strategically placed pillars.

The gaps between the columns are filled 
in with clear glass doors that slide shut. They are designed to break with 
ease under the force of flooding.

The ground floor, known as the ‘flood room’, feels like an ordinary room rather than a redundant space.

It's
 decorated like any other living space, expect every item within 
it is certified waterproof so they won't be ruined by floodwater.

Dubbed the ‘Tsunami House’, it stands at around 9m (30 ft) tall and can withstand the impact of waves with heights of up 2.4m (8ft) as well as a 7.8 scale earthquake and 85 mph lateral winds.

This is because the home’s two main floors are situated 2.7m (9ft) above ground. They are supported by a steel frame and strategically placed pillars, according to a report by Tuan Nguyen in Smithsonian Magazine.  

The gaps between the columns are filled 
in with clear glass doors that slide shut and are designed to break with 
ease under the force of flooding.

This would allow the water to flow 
through the bottom chamber and out the opposite side dispersing the force
 and reducing pressure on the columns.

‘If the building was a solid wall instead of columns filled in with glass doors, the whole thing could collapse under the momentum of the wave,’ Mr Nelson told Smithsonian Magazine.

‘We opted to enable the building to stay intact by letting the water move through along a path of least resistance.’

Western Washington lies over the 680-mile Cascadia subduction zone, which is one of the largest active faults in North America.
