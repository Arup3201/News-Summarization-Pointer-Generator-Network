Less than a year after giving birth to their respective babies, Jenna Dewan Tatum and Kristen Bell have taken their clothes off for Allure's May issue.

'Chan was really on board with it,' said Mrs Dewan Tatum, 33, who gave birth to Everly, her first child with Channing Tatum, her husband of five years, last May. 'He knows I'm very comfortable in my own skin.'

The raven-haired dancer-turned-actress looks ravishing as she languishes naked in a pool of peach-hued water, her hand gracefully covering her breast.

And new mom Kristen Bell, also 33, less than a year after the birth of her daughter Lincoln, with husband Dax Shepard, shows no hint of a mommy tummy as she kneels nude in the sand, her hair tousled.

Ms Bell, who last week told to Ellen Degeneres that her favorite show was Discovery Channel's Naked and Afraid, admits that she 'talks a big game' about being comfortable with herself, explaining to Allure: 'I wanted to put my money where my mouth was.'

Actress and Big Momma's House star Nia Long, a mother-of-two, echoes the sentiment, saying: 'When you have kids, your body changes drastically, and we have to learn to appreciate ourselves as we are.'

The 43-year-old New York-born star, who remarks that she can 'still go naked two babies later', admits: 'My boobs are not the same as they were before; I'm not going to lie.'

Also in the all-star nude line up, actress Minnie Driver, 44, opens up about how her feelings on her body have evolved with the passage of time.

'I never could have done this when I was 25. No way,' she says.

'All I saw were the flaws. I still see flaws, but I see what's great more - and I've got a banging body.'

Conversely, Ms Driver quit Twitter earlier this month after she received cruel jibes about a recent set of bikini snaps.

'I'm out of this Twittersphere for a while. It's too mean sometimes, about your body, about your soul. Not worth it,' she tweeted, confessing that he didn't have 'a thick enough skin.'

The eagerly awaited Nude issue stars 33-year-old actress Olivia Munn on its cover, who sizzles in softly shimmering make-up, and appears in a spread (with her clothes on) posing in dainty stilettos and a red printed gown.

Allure's May issue hits newsstands on April 29th.
