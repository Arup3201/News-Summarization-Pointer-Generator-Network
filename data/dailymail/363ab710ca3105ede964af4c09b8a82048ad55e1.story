He might have some of the quickest feet on a football pitch, but it was Neymar's speed of thought that was put to the test when he spent the day as co-driver in the passenger seat of a rally car.

The Brazil forward teamed up with current rally champion Sebastien Ogier to navigate the Volkswagen Polo through the twists and turns of the Monserrat mountain near Barcelona.

He might be more used to bamboozling defenders, but it was Neymar that was getting in muddle as the 22-year-old confused his left with his right.

The Barcelona forward had a huge grin on his face as he enjoyed the drive

The pair even had time for a short game of keep-ups after coming to a halt

'Left, right, no right,' Neymar yelled as he tried to get his head around the pacenotes while zipping round the corners at incredible speed.

Although his navigating skills might not have been the best the Barcelona forward seemed to enjoy going out for a spin with the WRC champion.

Neymar is seen clapping his hands and cheering as Ogier tackles the corners at pace before the Brazil international gives the thumbs-up as the car screeches to a halt.
