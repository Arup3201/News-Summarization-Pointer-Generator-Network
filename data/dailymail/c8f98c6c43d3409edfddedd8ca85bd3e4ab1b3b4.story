Manny Pacquiao has been showing off his stamina with a series of impressive videos as he enters a second week of training for his fight with Floyd Mayweather Jnr.

The 36-year-old could be seen sprinting up a hill with his entourage as part of his 'road' exercises. 

Pacquiao posted the videos online and said: 'Day 7 [sic] of my road work out increasing to high intensity love it! to God be all the Glory.'

The 36-year-old said his training was 'increasing to a high intensity' ahead of the bout on May 2

Another video showed the Filipino fighter doing bag work in the gym while his members of his team watched on.

There have been some suggestions from fans that this $300million fight - which will take place in Las Vegas on May 2 - should have been arranged years ago when both men were in their prime.

Pacquiao, though, insisted age would not be a deciding factor and that both men are at the top of their game. 

'It'll be as good of a fight as it would've been five years ago. The same,' Pacquiao told the LA Times. 'Both of us are still at the top.'
