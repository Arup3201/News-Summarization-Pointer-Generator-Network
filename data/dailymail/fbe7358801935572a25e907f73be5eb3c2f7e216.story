A maths genius who tried to kill his ex-girlfriend's brother with a speargun as he slept, then stabbed him to death with a carving knife, is today facing life in prison.

Cambridge-educated Andrew Morris, 30, was found guilty of murder - despite attempting to convince jurors at the Old Bailey that he was insane.

Morris, who earned £120,000 a year as an actuary, was arrogant, narcissistic, looked down on those less clever than him and felt compelled to hurt anybody who crossed him, the court was told.

He blamed Henry Stangroom, 21, when his sister Michelle broke up with him, moved out of their shared flat, refused to see him and demanded he delete sex tapes they had made.

Morris then plotted his elaborate revenge, the court heard, in which he tried to kill the sleeping Mr Stangroom with a single shot to the head.

But when the blow failed to kill him and his victim woke up, he stabbed him repeatedly with a kitchen knife then turned the speargun on himself.

Before the killing, Morris also 
killed Ms Stangroom's pet hamster. He filmed himself squeezing the 
animal in his fist until its eyes bulged from its head.

The
 court heard how before the attack Morris had searched the internet for 
terms including 'how to kill someone in their sleep', 'horror speargun 
accident' and 'sentence for murder in UK'.

 hurt his former partner by murdering the young cook.

When
 police found Morris lying in the bath 18 hours later he had apparently 
attempted to slash his wrists and the harpoon was sticking from his 
neck.

Morris claimed he acted in self-defence when he was attacked by Mr Stangroom, whom he claimed accused him of stalking his sister.

Morris slumped into his chair and started breathing sharply as he was told he would be jailed for life.

Ms
 Stangroom’s mother and father who have been in court for every day of 
the trial, broke down in tears when the jury of six women and five men 
delivered the verdict.

Judge
 Wendy Joseph told the jury ‘emotions in the courtroom have run high’ 
during the trial, and asked for impact statements from friends and 
family of the victim ahead of sentencing.

The court heard Morris had a maths degree from Cambridge and his incredible ability with figures allowed him to complete his actuarial exams in three years instead of the normal six.

But the court heard that Morris was a narcissist who who was shocked that any woman would reject him.

Ruth Owen, a former girlfriend, told how he would ruin her belongings whenever they had an argument.

She said he damaged her car, wrecked an oil painting and even snatched a treasured ring from her finger to throw into a river.

Morris became a father when he got another girlfriend Laura Teague pregnant, but abandoned her and his son and began his affair with Michelle, whom he met when he was working for finance company Pensions First.

They moved into the flat in Battersea in September 2012 and her brother moved in three months later. All three were drug users and took cocaine and nitrous oxide.

Morris was also suffering from depression and panic attacks and began taking more and more time off sick. He was working for a company called LCP and was involved in a £200m deal with Goldman Sachs.

But by May 2012 he had left work and was living a dissolute lifestyle at home.

His erratic behaviour began to extend Ms Stangroom, and he destroyed a pair of Tiffany sunglasses he bought her as punishment for ‘abandoning’ him at a wedding.

He later ripped a handbag he had given her in half, smashed an antique lamp that belonged to her grandmother and broke her crutches when she had a foot injury leaving her housebound.

Morris also threw her across the room and pinned her down with his hands over her nose and mouth. Ms Stangroom later moved out and said she would not return until he had overcome his issues.

The court then heard how Morris turned on Mr Stangroom, blaming him for the end of the relationship, prompting the horrific attack.

After the murder, Morris did not call the police but lay in the bath after the apparent suicide attempt with his arms outstretched in a crucifixion position.

Prosecutors claim he did not in fact intend to kill himself and knew he would be found the next day.

Strangroom and found the young chef lying on his blood soaked mattres.

Morris had also repeatedly stabbed a fluffy duck he had bought for Michelle which she always slept with.

On his phone and laptop computer they found many of the films he had made of his ex-girlfriend, and footage of his attack on her hamster.

Morris ran a mental health defence hoping to see out a sentence at a hospital rather a prison. But his claims were rejected by criminal psychiatrist Dr Philip Joseph.

Dr Joseph said: ‘When he feels rejected or jealous or his emotional needs are not met, he can respond with petulant, immature or aggressive behaviour.’

He said Morris was sane, but displayed ‘arrogance and narcissism and believes himself to be superior to others.’

After the verdict Morris struggled to stand as he was led from the dock.

Judge Joseph adjourned sentencing until May 30.
