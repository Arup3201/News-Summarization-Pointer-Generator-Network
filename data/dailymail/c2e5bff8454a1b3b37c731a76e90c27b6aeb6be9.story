Lewis Hamilton believes his British Grand Prix victory has provided him with 'a fresh start' as he heads into the second half of the the Formula One season.

Heading to Silverstone trailing Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg by 29 points after a run of races that had left him playing catch-up, the 29-year-old emerged with the best result possible.

Despite yet another mistake in qualifying as an error of misjudgement left him starting sixth to Rosberg's pole, Hamilton came away with a vital victory, whilst the 29-year-old German retired.

'Winning at Silverstone was just an incredible feeling - for myself, the team and the fans, I couldn't have asked for more,' said Hamilton.

'I feel like I've been on the back foot all year, only briefly leading the championship despite taking the wins I've had, so to have got myself just about level was exactly what I needed.

'It's almost a fresh start heading into the second half of the season and it's going to be a really close battle between us.

'There were lots of positives to take from Silverstone. Knowing I'm going into the next race with the best car, having shown I've good pace and knowing if I do a good job I can be ahead, is a good place to be.'

Rosberg knows the momentum he had built up since Monaco has evaporated in the space of one race and his first retirement of the year after finishing in the top two in the opening eight grands prix.

Approaching what he considers to be his second home race this season, along with Monaco, Rosberg said: 'Although it wasn't the result I wanted in the end, my weekend in Silverstone was really encouraging in a lot of ways.

'As a team we made all the right calls in a difficult qualifying session and the balance of the car felt very strong until I was unfortunately forced to retire.

'It was a real shame, but with the new regulations we are always going to be pushing the boundaries and I know how hard the team is pushing to give us the best car out there every weekend.

'I lost a lot of points and the championship battle is very close, but I'm feeling good and I'm really focused on getting a top result this weekend.

'Hockenheim is actually the circuit where I've won the most races during my career through all the junior categories, so I know it suits my driving style.

'Of course, I would love to add Formula One to that list some time soon.'
