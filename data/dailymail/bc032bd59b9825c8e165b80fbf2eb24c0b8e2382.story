One shopper was just picking up a few essentials from her local Target on Wednesday when she happened upon a heartwarming scene between an employee and a young man. 

Audrey Mark took a picture of the employee, now identified as Dennis Roberts, helping the unidentified young man tie a tie so he could look professional for a job interview at a nearby Chick-Fil-A fast-food restaurant.

Ms Mark posted the sweet photo online, and now both Mr Roberts and the chain are receiving praise for the extraordinary act that went above and beyond customer service. 

Heartwarming: A shopper at a Raleigh, North Carolina Target took this picture on Wednesday of a store employee helping a young man learn to tie a tie for a job interview at a nearby Chick Fil-A

Mr Roberts' coworker Cathy Scott was the first to greet the customer on Wednesday when he came in looking for a clip-on tie for his interview. 

Since the store was out of the clip-on ties, she directed him to the regular ties but he didn't know how to tie it. 

Good job: Both Mr Roberts and the Target chain are receiving praise for helping the boy out. Mr Roberts went to the Chick Fil-A the next day to see if the young man got the job, but the manager hadn't made his decision yet

After checking out, Ms Scott brought the boy back to her co-worker Mr Roberts. 

'Cathy says, "Can you tie a tie?" I said, "Yes,"' Mr Roberts told WTVD. 'We took the wrapping off it, and I tied it on my neck, and fit it over head adjusted it and tightened it...fixed all his collar buttons and he was set to go.' 

And that's not all - Mr Roberts went on to help the young man prepare for his job interview by asking him the typical questions a hiring manager would ask.  

'We said, "Make sure you look him in the eye." I'm saying make sure you give him a firm handshake, and she showed him... he tucked his shirt in,' said Mr Roberts. 

It was when he was giving the young man advice that Ms Mark snapped her now-viral photo. 

 "It was a very quiet simple moment, but it was very profound honestly kindness... from strangers... in a Super Target,' Ms Mark, a mother of three, said.  'He leaves and all these Target employees are screaming 'Bye! Good luck! Tell us how it went.'"

The young man left the store as the Mr Roberts and the other employees wished him good luck and asked him to come back and tell them how it went. 

'We were just here to help a young man get a job and forward his future,' Mr Roberts said. 

Mr Roberts, Ms Scott and some other employees went to the Chick-Fil-A on Thursday to see if the young man got the job, but the manager said he hadn't yet made his decision. 

According to a Facebook post by Mr Robert's daughter Sarah, he told the manager that 'if they don't hire him Target will!'
