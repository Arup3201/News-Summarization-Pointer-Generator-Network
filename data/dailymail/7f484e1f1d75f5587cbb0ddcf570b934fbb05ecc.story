Attack: BBC radio presenter Nikki Bedi fended off a would-be mugger after he attacked her while she was on her way to work

A BBC radio presenter refused to give up her mobile phone after she was attacked by a would-be mugger, it has been reported.

Nikki Bedi is the third female BBC radio presenter to have fallen victim to phone muggers in the past six months.

But the presenter managed to fend off the attacker after she was approached at a bus stop in west London while making her way to work.

The television and radio presenter, who works for Radio 2 and Radio 4, said she managed to force the mugger to flee after she refused to let go of her phone and started shouting.

She said: 'I had my phone out and was looking down at the screen when quite a big, tall man with a hoodie obscuring much of his face tried to rip the phone from my hands.'

She said she had been waiting in the bus shelter with another passenger, but that was not even enough to put off the attack, the London Evening Standard has reported.

She went on to say: 'But as I resisted the thief's yanking and vocalised, he fled into the night.

'It all happened in the blink of an eye and my fellow traveller was ready to give chase.'

Last month, television presenter Gaby Roslin chased a mugger down the street after he pushed her and grabbed her phone in Covent Garden.

Meanwhile radio and television presenter Joanne Good had her phone stolen by two hooded men in Marylebone in December.

More than 300 mobile phones are stolen every day in London, according to police, which is a 64 per cent increase on three years ago.
