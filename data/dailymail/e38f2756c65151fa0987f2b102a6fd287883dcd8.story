Rocketing numbers of parents are fraudulently trying to get their children into the country’s best state schools.

They are being caught using false addresses, pretending to be Roman Catholic, lying about siblings and even impersonating family members in an attempt to secure places.

Over the past five years, the number of council investigations into suspicious applications has risen almost 11-fold, a Daily Mail investigation has found.

The number of sanctions imposed – school places withdrawn or applications not accepted – has risen more than threefold over the same period.

The findings reveal the lengths desperate parents are prepared to go to prevent their children ending up in ‘sink’ schools.

Education experts believe the figures are the ‘tip of the iceberg’ because some councils are more proactive in investigating than others.

Tens of thousands of pupils are set to lose out on their first choice secondary school on National Offer Day on Friday. In some areas, half of them are expected not to gain their first preference.

The Mail submitted Freedom of Information requests to all 152 local education authorities in England on fraudulent applications for primary and secondary schools between 2007/8 and 2013/14.

For 2007/8, 96 councils responded. Of these, 36 gave full or partial data and the rest either did not collect the information or cited exemptions under the Freedom of Information Act.

Caught: Medway Council in Kent withdrew four primary places last year after it found families fraudulently used grandparents' or childminders' addresses

Applications of 99 children were probed which led to 38 sanctions.

In 2012/13, 91 councils responded, with 61 giving full or partial data. Applications for 1,059 children were investigated, leading to 129 places being withdrawn or not accepted.

From 2007/8 to 2012/13 there were 2,599 investigations and 516 sanctions. Extrapolated across the country, this equates to 7,573 investigations and 1,595 sanctions over the period.

Most probes relate to accusations that parents are registering a family member’s address or renting a property in a catchment area. Some also claim false sibling links.

In 2012/13 in Wolverhampton, five places were withdrawn due to parents using incorrect addresses, including a family member ‘posing’ as a child’s father.

Medway Council in Kent withdrew four primary places last year after it found families fraudulently used grandparents’ or childminders’ addresses. Knowsley Metropolitan Council in Merseyside withdrew  11 places from 2008/9 to 2012/13 due to ‘false Catholic baptism’ claims.

In another case, ‘parent A’ tipped off Buckinghamshire County Council last year about ‘parent B’ no longer living at the address provided. The school place was withdrawn from ‘B’ and given to ‘A’.

Hertfordshire County Council has seen an eight-fold rise in investigations, from 56 in 2008 to 455 last year.

Professor Alan Smithers, of the Centre for Education and Employment Research at Buckingham University, said: ‘We owe it to parents to defend admissions against unscrupulous competition and fraudulent activity.

'This is probably the tip of the iceberg as it’s not being investigated as much as it should be.’

Mrinal Patel became the first parent to face prosecution for allegedly lying about her address to gain a school place.

Harrow Council in North-west London accused the 41-year-old of giving her mother’s address when applying to the over-subscribed Pinner Park First School.

'False address': Mrinal Patel appeared at Harrow Magistrates' Court in May 2009 and denied fraud by false representation

She faced up to a year in jail or a £5,000 fine after the council used the Fraud Act 2006 to prosecute her over the school application for her five-year-old son Rhys.

Mrs Patel appeared at Harrow Magistrates’ Court in May 2009 and denied fraud by false representation.

However, two months later the council withdrew its action after being advised that the Act could not be applied to her case, and it was believed it could be open to challenge.

The case prompted Labour’s Ed Balls, then Schools Secretary, to order a review to look at possible loopholes.

At the time, Mrs Patel told the BBC that Harrow’s decision not to launch the ‘disproportionate’ action against her showed she was innocent.

But she admitted she had said on the application form that she had lived at the address for 14 years, when in fact she had stayed there for only four weeks.

The mother of three claimed she wrote this figure because her mother had been living at the address for 14 years. She had been ‘under a tremendous amount of stress’ at the time.

Her mother’s home was walking distance from the school that was rated ‘outstanding’ by Ofsted and received more than 400 applications for 90 places.

Mrs Patel said: ‘When they rang to check with me and asked if I was still living there, I said no. I never tried to hide anything.’

She also revealed that she had received hate mail over the case.

Harrow Council was unable to provide details about fraudulent school applications in response to the Mail’s FOI request.

It said: ‘If we find a place has been offered using a fraudulent address, we would withdraw the offer if the child has not started at the school. There have been a very small number of cases where this has been necessary over the past five years.’
