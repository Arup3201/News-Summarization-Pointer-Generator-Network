It’s a face-off between Popcorn and Caramel to see which lucky turkey gets to meet the president.

On Wednesday, President Barack Obama will pardon the National Thanksgiving Turkey, which has been an annual tradition since John F Kennedy was in the White House.

He pardons two turkeys each year, but only one of them gets the honour of being pardoned by him in person… or, in turkey, that is.

Face-off: Popcorn, left, and Caramel, right, are both vying for the spot to meet the president

This year an extra twist in the tradition has been enforced, as the public has been asked to vote on which one they deem should be so lucky.

The White House website has dedicated a full page to its chosen ones, brothers Caramel and Popcorn.

Caramel is the heaviest of the two, weighing 38 pounds and 4 oz and is 2 inches tall. His walk is ‘steady and deliberate’ and his gobble ‘quick, clear and frequent’, according to the site.

Which team are you on? Caramel, left, and Popcorn, right, are the two birds in the running for being pardoned by Obama on Wednesday. The public is being asked to vote online for their favourite bird

Eenie, meenie...: It's up to the public to vote on which lucky turkey will get to meet President Obama

Tough choice: The turkeys are presented to the public on Tuesday. One of the two will be in the spotlight again on Wednesday during the official pardoning ceremony

His favourite food is soybean meal and the song that rocks his world is Lady Gaga’s Bad Romance.

His opponent, Popcorn, is 37 pounds 6 oz and only 1 inch 11. But his walk is a ‘proud strut’ and his gobble ‘more garbled’ with ‘longer notes’.

He really likes to eat corn and his favourite song? None other than Beyonce’s ballad, Halo.

Voters can choose their favorite 
turkey through Twitter at #TeamCaramel or #TeamPopcorn, Instagram at 
#TeamCaramel or #TeamPopcorn and on Facebook, by 'liking' and 'sharing' their bird of choice.

Big boy: Popcorn is the heaviest of the two, weighing 38 pounds and 4 oz and is 2 inches tall. His walk is 'steady and deliberate'

They're just like us: Caramel's favourite food is soybean meal and the song that he loves the most is Lady Gaga¿s Bad Romance

Caramel
 and Popcorn will both survive the holiday season, and, if they are 
lucky, be able to live out their golden years for awhile yet.

But their brother, nicknamed ‘Delicious’, will not have the same fate.

The ugly 'duckling' arrived at the Minnesota capitol, Minneapolis, on Monday, where he met Governor Mark Dayton.

That bird will head to the St. Paul Salvation Army and ultimately end up as Thanksgiving dinner for a family who could not otherwise afford the meal.

The two turkeys spared a certain death last year by President Obama were not so lucky either.

Cobbler
 and Gobbler, two 40-pound birds from Rockingham Country, Virginia, had been sent off to live a charmed life on the sprawling historic estate of 
George Washington.

'Be free': President Barack Obama, with daughters Sasha (3rd left) and Malia (right), pardons the 2012 National Thanksgiving Turkey, Cobbler. It died in August

Tradition: Sparing turkeys started in 1963, when President John F Kennedy, pictured 2nd from left, sent that year¿s gift from the National Turkey Federation back to the farm, declaring 'we'll just let this one grow'

But they both died this year; One was euthanised and the other dropped dead of unknown causes. 

Maybe he was just 'old'.

The average turkey lifespan is roughly three to four years and Obama is not the first with a poor track record in this department.

Sparing turkeys is a tradition that dates back to 1963, when President John F Kennedy sent that year’s gift from the National Turkey Federation back to the farm, declaring ‘we’ll just let this one grow’.

President George H.W. Bush was the first to grant a turkey an official presidential pardon in 1989.
