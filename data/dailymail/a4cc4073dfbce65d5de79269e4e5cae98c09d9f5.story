Comedian Roy 'Chubby' Brown is risking a driving ban after he was caught for this third motoring offence over the past two months.

Brown, 69, whose real name is Royston Vasey, was chatting on his mobile phone when he was spotted by a police officer. 

The entertainer was has travelling from his Yorkshire home to a gym in Thornaby-on-Tees.

The policeman told Roy 'Chubby' Brown that he was a fan to which he replied: 'some f****** fan you are'

Brown told The Sun: 'It was my manager ringing. I was on the phone long enough to tell him I'd call him back.

'The officer who stopped me told he he was a fan. I said, some f****** fan you are.'

The squad car followed Brown from the road into the gym's car park where they handed him a traffic offence report. 

Now senior officers will decide whether to recommend issuing Brown with penalty points or ordering him to attend a road safety course. 

Almost three weeks ago, Brown received four points on his licence after he was filmed by speed camera van while driving down the road in his white Lexus while reading a newspaper. 

A month earlier, Brown was caught jumping a red light which cost him a further three points. 

If Brown receives three points for his latest offence he will be sitting on 10 - just two points shy of a driving ban.  

 In 2003, Brown was fined £200 after he assaulted a fan who swore at him in Blackpool. Brown explained: 'I have traditional values and I wanted the man to stop swearing in front of women and children who were on the pier.

In January 2010 Brown was acquitted on a charge of common assault at Teesside magistrates' court. Brown denied assaulting the woman in a Middlesbrough car park in December 2009. 

In July 2014 Brown picked up three penalty points after he jumped a red light in his car. 

Last month Brown received a further four penalty points after he was filmed reading a newspaper while driving along the roadway.

Almost three weeks ago Brown was photographed driving his car while reading the newspaper, pictured
