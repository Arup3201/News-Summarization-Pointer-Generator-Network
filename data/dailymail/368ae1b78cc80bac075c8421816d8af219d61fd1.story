A deadly drug which rots the flesh of users - and kills the majority of addicts within a year of their 
first hit - is spreading across Europe.

Krokodil
originated in Russia but is now reportedly on sale in Germany - where 
several deaths have been blamed on its use - leading the Czech 
Republic's national drug agency to warn of its dangers.

Dubbed
'the drug that eats junkies', it rots from the inside, 
causing such severe damage to tissue that users suffer from gangrenous sores which
open all the way to the bone.

Krokodil: Dubbed 'the drug that eats junkies', it turns its users' skin scaly, eating them from the inside. It also rots their brains

The condition can lead to limbs being 
amputated, but life expectancy for addicts is at the most two to three years, 
with the majority dying within a year.

Extraordinarily, around 1.2 million Russians are believed to have been ravaged by the narcotic, Time magazine has reported.

The drug, whose name means 'crocodile' - reportedly a reference to the way it turns users' skin
scaly - also rots their brains.

Krokodil is a sickening cocktail of over the counter painkillers, paint thinner, 
acid and phosphorus. In some cases, petrol is also added.

The resulting mixture is called desomorphine - a derivative of morphine - and is extremely addictive.

At
just Â£4 per injection it is a much cheaper alternative to heroin, 
especially in Russia where the painkillers are available without 
prescription.

The drug's 
prevalence in Russia has led to the Czech Republic's national anti-drug 
agency to warn heroin addicts not to switch to the alternative.

Spokesman
Michal Hammer said that although no cases had been reported in the 
country, its arrival in Germany would eventually see it cross the 
border.
