This is the shocking moment a cyclist was knocked off his bike and then assaulted by a swearing van driver, who has now handed himself in to police.

The clip, which is recorded from the cyclist's point of view, begins as he is driving alongside a van with a logo for a landscaping company on it.

Police are now urging the victim to come forward so they can properly investigate the attack, believed to be in Essex.

The white van is seen driving alongside the cyclist who yells at a passenger inside to: 'Get off the phone, you muppet.'

Shocking: This is the moment a van driver wrestled with a cyclist knocked off a bike and then throws a punch

Appeal: Essex Police want the victim to get in contact and refer to the incident as an 'assault'

Shockingly, the van is then seen veering dangerously close to the cyclist, who is then knocked over.

The van stops and its driver - wearing a hi-vis vest - emerges. 

As the cyclist remains on the pavement, the driver repeatedly swears at the cyclist and a fight takes place.

A date stamp on the video suggests it took place in December last year and police believe it took place near Hornchurch on the border with Essex and London.

Today MailOnline can reveal that the driver has handed himself into police but the cyclist is yet to be traced. 

Row: The cyclist was travelling along the road when he got in a row with the people in this white van

Fall: The cyclist then falls to the ground claiming he was knocked off - but the driver accuses him of riding into the van

Stop: The vehicle stops in the busy road and its driver gets out and confronts the man as he lies on the floor

Confrontation: The man and the cyclist shout at eachother as they disagree about the cause of the accident 

Essex Police said they believe the incident took place in Hornchurch last month and want to investigate

The clip was posted on YouTube and as a result, Essex Police tweeted today: 'We're aware of a You Tube video of a cyclist being assaulted + would advise the victim to contact police on 101 so it can be investigated.'

An Essex Police spokesman told MailOnline: 'A man has voluntarily attended at Chelmsford Police station this morning to give an account of the incident. It has now been established that this incident took place in the Hornchurch area and the matter has been passed to the Metropolitan Police to investigate'.

Scotland  Yard has said it would now like to speak to the cyclist. 

Taylor Landscaping have been suspended by TrustATrader, which describes itself as 'an online directory of tradespeople you can trust'.

Spokesman Gary McEwen said: 'TrustATrader is an online portal of tradespeople, who are vetted based on the quality of their work. We do not represent Taylor Landscaping or any of the tradespeople on our website. 

'Taylor Landscaping are members of TrustATrader and their membership has been suspended, pending a police investigation into the incident'.
