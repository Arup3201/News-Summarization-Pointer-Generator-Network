The family of an American woman whose husband allegedly killed their three-year-old daughter and then ended his own life last night, have spoken of their heartache.

They spoke out amid claims that Martin McCarthy killed his daughter Clarissa and himself after becoming convinced his 25-year-old wife Rebecca McCarthy, née Cejnar, wanted to end their relationship.

In the hours before the tragedy, the farmer from West Cork feared his wife was going to take Clarissa away, according to local sources.

Last night the little girl’s heart- 
broken grandfather Harry Cejnar was struggling to come to terms with 
what had happened to his daughter’s family.

Tragedy: Martin McCarthy, his wife Rebecca McCarthy (right) and their three-year-old daughter Clarissa McCarthy. It is believed that Mr McCarthy killed his daughter and then himself because he feared his wife would leave him

California-based Mr Cejnar said: ‘I don’t understand it at all. Rebecca and Martin were good parents.

'I hadn’t heard of any problems between them at all. I just don’t understand how this could have happened. Something must have gone wrong. Clarissa was a great kid.’

Detectives now believe Mr McCarthy, a prominent farmer, drowned three-year-old Clarissa, whose fourth birthday would have been in two months, before taking his own life.

The little girl’s distraught mother arrived home on Tuesday night to find a note and she alerted police. She is believed to have been present when investigators found the bodies of her husband and daughter.

Clarissa’s heartbroken grandfather added: ‘Rebecca couldn’t have brought Clarissa back to the United States because Clarissa didn’t have a passport. The laws in Ireland would mean Martin would have to say that was OK. It just doesn’t make any sense at all.’

Struggling to hold back tears at his apartment in Artesia, about 15 miles south of Los Angeles, Mr Cejnar said his daughter grew up in southern California, going to school in nearby Whittier.

‘I took Clarissa and Rebecca to Knotts Berry Farm theme park in California just last November. She was just three years old and she was already reading and writing.

‘How could anybody hurt a little girl like that? Nobody in their right mind would do that to their own daughter,’ said Mr Cejnar, who held a photograph of his daughter, grandchild and son-in-law, taken in recent months.

Mrs McCarthy met her future husband on a school exchange trip to Ireland when she was 16. ‘She came home and told me that she was going to get married to Martin. She said she was going to wait until she was 18.

'She did just that and went to Ireland when she was 18 and got married. They had an online relationship before that,’ he said.

' It just doesn’t make any sense at all.

They married in a quiet ceremony in Cork when she was 19. He was 44 at the time. Last night, her devastated sister Jessica Cejnar said the family were ‘shaken up’ by the distressing news. She revealed their mother Linda and aunt are making their way to Ireland to comfort her sister.

Ms Cejnar said she learnt the news late on Tuesday night, adding that it was a ‘horrible’ phone call to receive.

‘Our mam and aunt will head over to West Cork now to be with her. I don’t really know what happened, I don’t know the circumstances,’ she told the Mail.

‘I am very close with my sister, and have visited West Cork a few times. I don’t know much about Martin. I know he was older than her. We are all pretty shaken up over this. We don’t know what’s happened.’

A note left on the kitchen table was 
the first sign that something was terribly wrong when Rebecca McCarthy 
returned to her darkened farmhouse home at 11pm on Tuesday.

The distraught mother of  one 
immediately raised the alarm and so began a frantic search for her 
missing three-year-old daughter Clarissa and husband Martin.

The 25-year-old Californian was last 
night still coming to terms with the devastating discovery of her 
daughter’s body in shallow water off a shingle beach a few hundred metres from their remote West Cork home.

The couple doted on Clarissa, shocked neighbours and friends said yesterday.

But there was speculation last night 
that the husband’s devotion to his farm was such that it may have 
frustrated his younger wife, and that he began to fear she would return home to America with their child.

The unlikely match of the bachelor 
farmer – 25 years her senior – with the fun-loving teenager from America
raised eyebrows among locals in the early stages of the romance.

Arriving as a college student in the 
home of Mark and Terri O’Mahony in the neighbouring townland of 
Cappaghglass,  Ballydehob, young Rebecca  Cejnar caught the eye of the ‘big farmer’ next door.

She was sent over from California for
her school holidays by  her parents, Harry Daniel Cejnar and Linda Jean
Bailey, who  had mutual friends with the O’Mahonys in LA.

The teenager wanted to learn about Irish culture and traditions and the family treated her as their own. 

Mrs McCarthy ran a local cake business, Audley Cove Cakes.

On the Facebook page for that business, she had posted a picture of Clarissa’s second birthday cake from almost two years ago.

Parents at the opening day of the 
Ballydehob primary school yesterday noted that the little girl, who 
would be four in May, was never given the chance to see inside the classroom.

Reverend Stephen McCann yesterday 
remembered the  family at his morning service at St Mathias and St 
Mathew’s Church of Ireland church.

Although neither Rebecca nor her 
husband are members of  the Protestant faith, he said  he had known Mrs 
McCarthy through her cake-baking skills and community participation.

‘This is a small community and 
everyone just gets involved in everything regardless of whether they are
members of one church or another.’

He recalled meeting fellow American 
Rebecca on several occasions, including at a speech on baking made to 
the local Mothers’ Union women’s group last year. But he said he never met her husband.

Rev McCann said his thoughts were with the entire family.

‘We need to pray for the families 
now. Everyone in this community knows one another and we will just pray 
now for them all,’ he said.

Martin McCarthy had been afraid that 
his wife Rebecca was going  to take their couple’s three- year-old 
daughter to the US, gardaí believe.

Hours
before he and Clarissa were found dead, arguments between the couple 
had been playing on his mind – and he had convinced himself that he was 
going to lose the girl, security sources claimed yesterday.

According to friends, he absolutely ‘adored’ his daughter and could not face losing her. Yesterday,
two gardaí kept watch at the top of the country lane leading into the 
old farmhouse that the 50-year-old farmer had inherited from his parents
John Christopher and Elizabeth McCarthy.

It is believed Mr McCarthy had suffered a heart scare in recent times and had finally taken on some staff to help on the farm.

He met Rebecca when she was a teenager, locals said. She used to holiday at a house owned by a friend of his.

They
struck up a friendship that later developed into a romance. ‘It took a 
lot of people by surprise, perhaps because of the age difference,’ said a
friend.

‘The
wedding was a very small and quiet affair. I don’t know that many 
people who went to it. Martin was never one for a great deal of show.

‘He was very understated and was never happier than when he was working on any one of his many fields.

‘He wasn’t known to drink or smoke and certainly none of the local pubs regarded him as even an occasional visitor.

Instead, one of his few joys outside work was his regular Tuesday night trip to the Health Centre in Ballydehob.

There
he played cards in the waiting area with elderly people who were either
waiting for treatment, or used to just pop in for company.

On the night of his death, locals noticed that his Jeep was not parked in its usual place.

‘Martin was a creature of habit and routine,’ said a friend. ‘He had a regular routine and he stuck to it.‘Every Tuesday for as long as I can remember, I’d always see him pulling up at around 8pm.

He added: ‘When he didn’t turn up on Tuesday, I thought something might  be wrong.’

Described
as ‘an old-fashioned man tied to the land’, Mr McCarthy only ventured 
out to go to Mass or attend Fine Gael fundraisers, where he was  a local
activist and regular church-gate collector.

The farmer was also remembered as a kind neighbour who was first to help out when machinery broke or anything needed repairing.

One neighbour said: ‘He was a man who could turn his hand to anything but he was an all work, no play kind of guy you know.

‘No woman wants that and I think that it eventually took its toll.’

Another visibly upset acquaintance said last night: ‘I am so sad for  what has happened to that innocent little child.

‘I am so sad for her mother.’
