When Truffle the dog fell from a cliff, no-one could have imagined it would result in one of the most fun-filled, novel Summers of his life.

The Sydney pooch broke both of his paws in his awful fall on Boxing Day, meaning he is completely incapable of moving with two bright green casts encasing his front legs.

His owner, Peter Taylor, from Darlinghurst in Sydney inner eastern suburbs, was worried that his beloved pet would spend the summer cooped up in the apartment, unable to enjoy the sunshine.

However, the dedicated owner had a brainwave - deciding that a stroller would be the perfect way to make sure that Truffle wouldn’t miss out on a second of the action.

‘It’s hysterical. Truffle has a look of glee on his face that I’ve never seen on that scale before when I wheel him around in the ‘Truf-mobile,’ Mr Taylor told Daily Mail Australia.

The sight of Truffle the dog in his stroller, smiling happily with two casts on his front legs has been bringing smiles and laughter to everyone he encounters

‘I love the little guys to bits and hated the thought of Truff being confined to a one bedroom apartment for up to six weeks...I only wish the solution didn't make me look quite as kooky as the stroller does!’

The result is both hilarious and incredibly sweet, as the pup is unable to contain his excitement every time he is strapped into the stroller, just like a child. 

Mr Taylor walks his dogs through the streets of his Kings Cross neighbourhood everyday – a place where these types of ‘kooky’ activities aren’t out of place!

Although Truffle is enjoying every moment, Mr Taylor is a little more self-conscious, trying his best to ignore the funny looks they get while he pushes Truffle down the street

‘I am worried that people think I’m attempting to channel a Hilton or a Kardashian with my dog in a stroller!’ laughs Mr Taylor.

‘In reality just trying to make sure my dogs, Truffle and Enzo, make the most of the summer and can get away from the apartment.’

‘I’m so happy that Truffle is out of the house again and roaming the streets with his partner in crime, Enzo.’

He is a sweet-natured pup, which means he happily poses for hilarious snaps to his owner's delight

The normally energetic pup wasn't himself after the accident, and being confined to the home gave him a case of 'cabin fever', although his owner Peter Taylor says it was remarkable that he 'never complained'

His two gorgeous dogs love being outside and before Truffle’s accident would swim in the harbour everyday, walking through beautiful park lands to Rushcutters Bay in Sydney’s east or Lady Macquarie’s Chair in the inner city.

It was during one of these ventures that Truffle’s awful accident took place.

‘They are both Lagottos, a breed of Italian water dogs, so their favourite thing in the world is swimming.

‘After a swim on Boxing Day, we were walking to the top of a viewing platform near Lady Macquarie’s Chair when he slipped down a rock face.'

It was a silly accident as 'there’s a bit of a ‘blonde’ element to Truffle,' explained Mr Taylor. 

'He took one step too far and disappeared over the edge.' 

It was a tense, distressing moment when the shaggy-haired pup disappeared from view.

‘I heard a horrible scream from the footpath below and someone later told me that they saw a dog flying through the air,’ explains Mr Taylor.

‘Truffle’s best friend Enzo ran down to him straight away and we found a pretty crumpled Truffle down below.’

They rushed him to the vet at nearby Potts Point where X-Rays confirmed that he had fractured both his front paws.

‘He was given plenty of TLC and wrapped up in plaster and bandages. They were bright orange casts but we just changed them to a bright green,’ said Mr Taylor.

‘He has little robot arms at the moment – he can lift them up and down but that’s about it!’

Although the pooch was very brave and ‘never once complained’, he developed ‘cabin fever’ and it very quickly became clear that Truffle needed to get outside and enjoy the sunshine; a challenge as he is completely incapable if moving.

‘I tried carrying him a few times but he’s close to 20 kilos so I could only carry him a couple of blocks.’

Truffle's owner says he did experience moments of cabin fever and was clearly missing his daily trips to the park and his active time in the sun

Both Peter Taylor's beloved dogs are very active. Mr Taylor walks them everyday, but so do other friends who stop by to visit the pups while he is at work, meaning their owner 'doesn't know what they get up to everyday, but they know everyone in the area, even people I've never seen before!'

Mr Taylor had the ingenuous idea to ask if any of his friends had a spare stroller. It was an instant success.

‘Once I put him in there, he was like a duck to water. He couldn’t have been any happier,’ explained Mr Taylor. 

‘He just loves being wheeled around on his ‘throne’, the Truf-Mobile,' 

‘It’s party central for him!’

The sight of the pup strapped in his stroller like a baby has been quite the novelty, bringing smiles to the faces of strangers.

They are frequently stopped by people who ask to take selfies with Truffle, who has a comical smile plastered to his face during every trip in his stroller.

‘He’s loving the attention, although I’m not a huge fan of all the looks we get from people in main street of Kings Cross,' said Mr Taylor.

‘He couldn’t be happier to smile and pose for selfies.’

Mr Taylor has shared lots of sweet pics on his Instagram, @pupsinthecity. 

Peter Taylor is trying to make sure Truffle enjoys his Summer as much as possible. The dog's casts have just been changed from orange to green during a check up, for a touch of variety!

Although Mr Taylor does laugh that Truffle could become a diva and become attached to the stroller, long after his injuries have healed. 

‘I just don’t know how he’ll return to normal life when the casts come off!’ the Darlinghurst resident laughed.

An unexpected response has been the joy and laughter Truffle and his stroller is bringing to the streets of Kings Cross – a place which is home to some downtrodden and disadvantaged members of society.

‘You get the most sense of glee watching Truffle enjoy himself in his stroller!’ explains Mr Taylor.

‘It’s nice walking around Kings Cross with him, because a lot of people you do come across are having a pretty tough time or might be having a rotten day.

‘One of the unexpected benefits is that he can put smile on faces that would otherwise be pretty gloomy.’

His two pets have an incredible bond that has also been very special to witness.

Enzo and Truffle have a beautiful friendship and their owner says it has been remarkable to see how much Enzo has nurtured for his injured companion

Truffle’s playmate is a very special dog in his own right, as Enzo has worked for the past four years as a ‘therapy dog’ in a mental health practice.

‘Enzo sits with the psychiatrists and gives the clients that little bit of extra TLC that doctors can’t do,’ said Mr Taylor.

The beautiful chocolate Lagotto provides company to people during appointments, to help and comfort them in vulnerable moments.

‘He gives the clients a nudge and they can pat him as they talk through the tough stuff,’ said Mr Taylor.

Enzo is a 'therapy dog', but is currently focusing his attention on providing 24/7 comfort to Truffle

Truffle and Enzo (before the accident) are wonderful companions to their owner, Mr Taylor, accompanying him to the park as he catches up on work - truly man's best friends!

However, Enzo is having a break as he commits fulltime to the task of helping his pal recover.

‘He’s made the switch from being a therapy dog for humans to a therapy dog for his best mate!’

‘It’s been amazing to watch, he honestly hasn’t left Truffle’s side since the incident. He gives him nudges on the nose and licks on the paw to remind him that he’s there with him.’

What began as a very sad event for the little family-of-three has now become a fun adventure, proving that a dog really is man’s best friend.

The most wonderful lesson has been in the face of adversity, the only thing we can control is how we respond.

‘I was thinking “poor Truffle, two front legs broken and he’s completely out of action, how sad!”

‘But he’s embraced life to the full. He hasn’t whinged once, just constantly smiling,’ said Mr Taylor.

‘When life serves us lemons, you’ve just got to make the best possible lemon meringue pie!’ 

The dogs are thrilled that they can still spend time together during walks, with Mr Taylor explaining that Truffle (left) only becomes anxious or fidgety when his best mate Enzo (right) is out of view

Truffle is spreading smiles across the streets of Kings Cross - now that he is in his stroller and more comfortable with his casts!
