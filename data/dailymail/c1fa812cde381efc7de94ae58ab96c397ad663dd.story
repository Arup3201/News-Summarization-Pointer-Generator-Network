Foreign Minister Julia Bishop has told women to 'stop whinging' and to not 'become a victim' in the wake of her being named 'Woman of the Year' by Harper's Bazaar magazine.

The 58-year-old made the outspoken claims talking about her role as a woman in the male-dominated world of politics and she still stands by her opinion of not being a feminist.

She told the magazine: 'Stop whinging, get on with it and prove them all wrong.'

The post put up on Twitter by Geoff Pearson questioning whether the new Julie Bishop photos are Photoshopped

'Please do not let it get to you and do not become a victim, because it's only a downward spiral once you've cast yourself as a victim.' 

Twitter commentator Geoff Pearson @GCobber99 posted comments questioning whether the new photos of Ms Bishop have been Photoshopped. 

The post reads: 'Football, meatpies, kangaroos and Abbott LIES on Facebook: Winner of Photoshop of the year'.  

Ms Bishop is described by Attorney-General George Brandis in the magazine, as 'the complete political product: someone who has mastered her portfolio, who's proven she can be among the best', reports the SMH.

It has been a significant week in the press for Bishop, stepping out in style at the Melbourne Cup, and a poll indicating that her popularity now rivals Prime Minister Tony Abbott.

Now the first female Foreign Minister has been awarded the honour of 'Woman of the Year' by Harper's Bazaar.

In the article, which is filled with praise from political and public personalities, Ms Bishop discusses her experience as a woman in politics, despite maintaining that she is not a feminist. 

The Foreign Minister's popularity has nearly doubled in the past five months, with Ms Bishop now rivalling Prime Minister Tony Abbott as preferred Liberal leader.

A Fairfax-Ipsos nationwide poll found Ms Bishop's popularity has jumped from 11 percent to match Mr Abbott, each having 20 percent support from voters in the preferred leadership stakes.

Ms Bishop fiercely confronted Russian President Vladimir Putin late last month at a summit in Italy to question him over the MH17 disaster over the Ukraine.

The Foreign Minister was further regarded for pushing the resolution the United Nations Security Council passed back in July to allow Australia and other countries access to the Malaysian Airlines crash site to retrieve the bodies.

Ms Bishop was also listed as one of the 50 most powerful women in Australia of 2014 by the Australian Women's Weekly. 

When asked by a journalist in Sydney if Ms Bishop was now Mr Abbott's heir apparent, he said: 'I think Julie is my stellar colleague.

'I think that's what she is, along with Malcolm Turnbull, Joe Hockey, Scott Morrison and the rest of the team.' 

But it appears Ms Bishop has no plans of taking the country's top job as she told Daily Mail Australia on Tuesday that she is 'living the dream and loving the job'.

'I am in the best job I could ever wish for,' she said.

'It's the job I wanted to do when I went into politics.'

Ms Bishop turned heads this week when she stepped out in glamour at the Melbourne Cup races on Tuesday, fueling speculation that she was in a relationship with businessman David Panton.

The Daily Telegraph reported that the pair had been dating for six months, which the Foreign Minister denied.

A spokeswoman told Daily Mail Australia on Friday that 'no, no they are just friends, as soon as the stories (about them being in a relationship) appeared the Minister made it clear that they are friends'.

'They attended the race day just as friends. The Minister rightly keeps her private life private but the reports of a relationship were incorrect.'

Mr Panton's two adult daughters Sally and Laura also accompanied him to Flemington for day two of the Cup Carnival.

A property investor from Melbourne, Mr Panton recently relocated to the beachside Sydney suburb of Manly from the Melbourne suburb of Shoreham.
