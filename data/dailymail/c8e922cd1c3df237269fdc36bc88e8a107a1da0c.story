Almost £15million of public money has been paid out in compensation to immigrants unlawfully detained in the UK, official figures have revealed.

The Home Office paid out the vast sum over the past three years alone, Immigration Minister James Brokenshire admitted.

Former coalition minister Sarah Teather, who uncovered the figures, accused the Home Office of treating people inhumanely by detaining them indefinitely and costing the taxpayer millions in the process.

Ms Teather is chairing a cross-party inquiry into immigration detention and said evidence from former detainees had revealed the ‘hugely damaging’  cost of being held with no time limit.

The Liberal Democrat MP said: ‘That the Home Office have had to pay out nearly £15 million over three years for breaking the law when detaining people shows that they are unable to even comply with their own rules.

‘The UK is the only country in the EU that doesn't have a time limit on how long people can be kept in immigration detention but it appears that the Home Office would sometimes rather detain people indefinitely than treat them humanely, even if this ends up costing the taxpayer millions of pounds.

‘But these figures shouldn't obscure the considerable emotional and mental cost that not knowing how long you might be detained for, or if you're going to be deported tomorrow, or moved hundreds of miles away to a different detention centre, has on detainees.' 

Mr Brokenshire said that in 2011-12  £4.5 million was paid out, with the figure rising to £5 million in 2012-13, before falling again to £4.8 million in 2013-14.

The figures follow criticism of the Government's decision last month to allow outsourcing giant Serco to continue running a controversial immigration detention centre for women.

Yarl's Wood in in Bedfordshire has faced heavy criticism by human rights campaigners amid reports of sexual misconduct by staff, women being detained for long periods and pregnant detainees being held without justification.

After Greece, the UK made the highest use of detention for asylum seekers in Europe in 2013, with more than 30,000 asylum seekers spending some time in detention, with 2,796 detained as at December 31, a report by the Centre Forum think tank claimed last month.

A Moroccan man was awarded damages for unlawful detention at a recent High Court case after the judge ruled eight of the 22 months he was held in immigration detention were unlawful.

Mustafa Fardous won the case because the ‘purpose and reasonableness’ of his detention was not reappraised after a year.

Mr Fardous had claimed asylum using a false name and falsely claimed that he was from the Western Sahara. He was detained after arriving in the UK in September 2009 and held until July 2011.
