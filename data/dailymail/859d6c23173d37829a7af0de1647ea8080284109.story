Killed: Michael Brown was shot and killed by officer Darren Wilson in August, prompting a firestorm of protests in the St Louis, Missouri, suburb.

Supporters of the white cop who shot dead a black teenager in Missouri have published a slick video attacking Barack Obama for failing to back the officer’s family.

The seven-minute clip says that the President should have got in touch with Darren Wilson’s relatives to give them his support in the wake of the August 9 killing in Ferguson, a suburb of St Louis.

The video says that Wilson’s life was ‘turned upside down’ and that Mr Obama aligned himself with Michael Brown, the 18-year-old who was killed.

The unabashed footage is upbeat in tone and is set to two songs: ‘Don’t Stop Believin’ by rock band Journey and ‘We’re not gunna take it any more’ by Twisted Sister.

It makes clear the strength of feeling among some in St Louis that Wilson, 28, is the victim and not just Brown.

The footage also uses inflammatory language to attack Brown and calls him a ‘thug criminal’ who carried out a robbery shortly before he was killed.

Provocative: The video accuses President Obama of failing to support officer Darren Wilson, labelling the dead teenager  'a thug criminal'

In the spotlight: Officer Wilson is awaiting the decision of a grand jury convened in the wake of his shooting to death of Michael Brown. The video claims that protesters were denying him a part in the debate over the killing

It calls his friend Dorian Johnson, who was with Brown the night he died, ‘one lying witness / accomplice (who) forever changed the fate of Ferguson’.

The video emerged as the Grand Jury continue to deliberate whether to indict Wilson, who has been in hiding for the past three months.

It has so far been watched 5,000 times on YouTube and is called: ‘WE ARE DARREN WILSON - DON'T STOP BELIEVING BECAUSE WE'RE NOT GONNA TAKE IT!’

The seven minute clip goes through the story of how Wilson’s supporters felt that his voice had to be heard and so set about organising themselves.

In a series of stills with text over the top they say that some used the story of Brown’s death ‘as an excuse to commit crimes’, though many of the protests were peaceful and the organisers discouraged violence.

Civil rights campaigners the Rev Al Sharpton, the Rev Jesse Jackson and Attorney General Eric Holder are described as being ‘antagonistic friends’.

Along with Missouri Governor Jay Nixon they turned the story into a ‘race war’ in order to ‘rob officer Darren Wilson of justice’, the video claims. It then shows a series of photos which have been sent in of supporters - many in law enforcement - with the caption: ‘I am Darren Wilson’.

The video says: ‘Not once did the President send condolences to Darren Wilson for his life being turned upside down while defending himself against a thug criminal’.

President Obama did however release a statement to Brown’s family which read: ‘The death of Michael Brown is heartbreaking, and Michelle and I send our deepest condolences to his family and his community at this very difficult time’.

Attack: From left Rev Jesse Jackson, Rev Al Sharpton and Eric Holder, the attorney-general, are accused of giving succor to anti-police protesters in the video. All three men went to Ferguson in the wake of the killing

Damage: The video equates protesters with the looters who rioted after the death and suggests the facts support Darren Wilson

Wilson’s supporters have carried out a number of rallies around St Louis and set up the ‘I support officer Wilson’ Facebook page which now has 78,000 likes.

The ‘Support Darren Wilson’ community has 81,000 likes.

One of the latest comments from user Pete Palella reads: ‘Cant wait for that "not guilty" verdict to be announced!’

Wilson’s supporters first made themselves heard in their first rally held a week after Brown was shot dead.

During the protest in the Clayton area of St Louis they wore specially printed $7 T-shirts with a police shield on them and the words: ‘I stand by Darren Wilson’.

Instead of a badge number it read 8.9.14, which is day he shot dead Brown.

Division: While supporters of Darren Wilson have released their new video, opponents want to see a criminal trial for first-degree murder - and a finding of guilt. This demonstrator made her point last night in front of Ferguson's police department in the St Louis suburb

Tension: Ferguson and surrounding areas are on a knife-edge as the grand jury deliberations on whether to indict officer Darren Wilson over the killing of Michael Brown are expected to conclude.

Wilson’s supporters say he is the one who is being slandered and some have even claimed that he should get compensation for the way he has been treated.

According to Twisted Sister’s singer Dee Snider, ‘We’re not gunna take it’ was intended to be played ‘any time that the team is down by two, or somebody had a bad day at the office’.

It was used by 2012 Republican vice-presidential candidate Paul Ryan until Snider asked him not too - as he was going to vote for President Obama. 

By LAURA COLLINS FOR MAILONLINE IN FERGUSON, MISSOURI

A group describing itself as a 'Militant Resistance' to a 'corrupt police state' has offered $5000 for details of Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson's whereabouts, MailOnline can reveal.

Officer Wilson, 28, has been in hiding on paid leave ever since he gunned down unarmed teenager Michael Brown, 18, on 9 August.

Now, in one of a series of incendiary tweets the RbG Black Rebels have stated, 'We are paying $5k cash for location of Ofc. Darren Wilson. Real $, no joke, no crime we just wana get his photo an ask him a few questions.'

And though the RbG Black Rebels insist this is not a bounty on the officer's head, the chilling offer is set in the context of a stream of violent online posts boasting of 'combat experience', 'stockpiling' ammunition, cleaning out gun stores and being #WarReady. 

The incendiary tweet from the group: part of a twitter feed which includes references to 'war ready' which is likely to increase tensions in Ferguson ahead of the expected grand jury verdict on the shooting of Michael Brown by police office Darren Wilson

The 'Black Rebels' have used their Twitter feed to claim the police are preparing for 'war' when the grand just verdict is announced

Pointed: The feed includes a reference to ammunition which will 'solve a lot of problems'. The FBI has already warned that extremist violence is 'likely'.

Typical of the reponse elicited by the offer is one follower's demand, '@BlackRebels_Stl@OpFerguson Yank that bastard off the street. He is a murderer running free still.' 

Governor Jay Nixon has already declared a State of Emergency and called in the National Guard in anticipation of the violence that FBI agents have described as 'inevitable' when the Grand Jury charged with deciding the fate of Officer Wilson, 28, delivers their verdict.

Having promised that a decision would be reached 'by late November' it now seems likely that the Grand Jury will return that decision this week.

A series of Grand Jury leaks, and Missouri law which allows officers to use lethal force if they believe their life to be in danger, have led many to believe that Wilson will not be indicted on murder charges as Brown's family and supporters hope.

It is three months since Wilson pumped six bullets into the teenager as he walked down the middle of the road with a friend. 

In the wake of the shooting which ignited racial tension in the Missouri town rioters took to the streets armed with Molotov cocktails and chanting the slogan 'Hands Up Don't Shoot' - a reference to some witness accounts that the teenager had his hands up in surrender when Wilson fired off his fatal volley of shots.

RbG Black Rebel's disturbing offer and tweets show the seething anger and hunger for violence among some agitators. They have no faith in the judicial system and seem intent on ignoring official calls for peaceful protest and calm.

As reported by MailOnline that chatter has extended to St Louis own police officers.

Writing on the forum St Louis Cop Talk one user writing under the username 'A Concerned Cop' advised residents, 'If you do not have a gun, get one and get one soon. We will not be able to protect you or your family.'

In what appeared to be a direct strike at Governor Nixon's decision to activate the National Guard rather than entrusting St Louis's own force with policing the streets of Ferguson, the user continued, 'It will be your responsibility to protect them. Our gutless commanders and politicians have neutered us.

'I'm serious, get a gun, get more than one, and keep one with you at all times.'
