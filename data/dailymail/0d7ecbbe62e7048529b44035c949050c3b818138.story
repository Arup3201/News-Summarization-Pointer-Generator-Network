There's a well-quoted 'Wintourism' that goes: 'It’s always about timing. If it’s too soon, no one understands. If it’s too late, everyone’s forgotten.'

However it seems Anna Wintour may have forgetten to live some of the joys of Christmas this year, with that timing obsession seeing Vogue's famed neat freak tossing out her tree before Santa had arrived.

Bee Shaffer, daughter of the celebrated perfectionist, posted a photo on her Instagram on Christmas Day showing a bunch of presents and designer shopping bags sitting all of their lonesome.

'My mom threw out our tree before Christmas Day because "it was too messy"' Shaffer posted.

So ... where do we hang the stockings?: Anna Wintour's daughter Bee Shaffer posted this photo on Instagram on Christmas Day showing a heap of presents piled in a corner because her mom decided to get rid of the Christmas tree early

Anna Wintour and her daughter Bee Shaffer, seen here in a photo from Paris Fashion Week 2012, enjoyed a Christmas without a tree this year

Anna Wintour's 19th century townhouse, in an exclusive block of Sullivan Street, Greenwich Village, has become known for its intimate events and celebrity soirees

The holiday snap was presumably taken inside Wintour's Greenwich Village townhouse in New York City, although she also has a home on Long Island.

Shaffer, 26, moved back to Manhattan earlier this year from LA, where she had been working for Glee creator Ryan Murphy, to take a job as a segment producer for Seth Meyers at NBC.

Just last week, Wintour - who is also Conde Nast's artistic director and reportedly earns over $2 million a year - hosted her annual Christmas party at the Greenwich Village townhouse.

Perhaps the tree had already served its festive function when Wintour decided it was to be taken down.

Wintour, 64, lives at the house with her long-term partner, Texas-born billionaire and telecommunications pioneer Shelby Ryan.

Besides Bee - real name Katherine - the magazine maven has another child, Charles, 28, both with ex-husband David Shaffer.

Her home has become known for its elegant events and celebrity soirees.

Anna Wintour has built her reputation on precision on taste, so the fact she threw out her Christmas tree before Christmas should not come as a surprise to many

In 2010, neighboring streets such as McDougal and Thompson were closed from 9AM in preparation for an evening soiree that was to be attended by Barack and Michelle Obama, among other celebrities and Manhattan movers and shakers.

Wintour's house is 3,960 square-feet and, along with every home in the block, opens up onto an exclusive residents-only park locked within the hollow middle grounds of the building.

A nearby townhouse was recently listed for sale with an asking price of $8.8 million, while onetime neighbor Richard Gere sold his place for $12.8 million in 2007.

While the tree situation seems a little extreme, Wintour's reputation is based on nothing if not her taste.

Most recently, she cancelled a scheduled Vogue cover featuring twerking 20-year-old pop starlet Miley Cyrus after seeing her infamous VMA performance with Robin Thicke.

According to reports, the editrix decided Cyrus would be a bad look for her beloved fashion bible.

‘Anna found the whole thing distasteful,’ a source said.

‘She decided, based on Miley’s performance, to take the cover in a different direction.’
