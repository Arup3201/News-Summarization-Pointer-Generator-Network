This heart-warming video shows a mystery couple elegantly ballroom dancing on the seafront in the rain - blissfully unaware they are being filmed by an onlooker.

The twinkle-toed couple had placed a stereo on the floor and were performing tangos and twirls as the waves crashed in next to them.

Ms McCabe, a 34-year-old florist, said: 'I couldn't believe it when I looked out and saw them two there. They were dancing away, oblivious to the fact the weather was pretty bad'

They were seen together for more than an hour - practicing a number of different moves including the rumba in the abandoned lido in Tynemouth, Tyne and Wear.

Ms McCabe, a 34-year-old florist, said: ‘I couldn’t believe it when I looked out and saw them two there.

‘They were dancing away, oblivious to the fact the weather was pretty bad. It was like watching the Strictly live show.

‘They were out there for more than an hour - it was mesmerising. What made it better is that they’re actually really good dancers. I’m a bit jealous, actually.’

Her dad John Walsh added: ‘They were dancing by the waves in an old derelict abandoned swimming pool. How romantic.

‘I wish I could dance. I should have gone over to get a few pointers.’
