My friendly acquaintance of many years, Jeremy Paxman, was arraigning me on the litany of false charges still cherished by much of the British press, partly from malice, but mainly from simple ignorance of the distant and prolonged disintegration of the US government’s case against me.

I had returned to Britain, after an absence of seven years, four hours before. Familiar and unfounded though his allegations were, the jut-jawed righteousness with which he called me a criminal, the head-boy pieties, and this crusader of truth’s imperturbable innocence of the profound corruption of the American legal system, stirred me from the fatigue of overnight air travel.

He should have known better, but there is no reason why his viewers, or The Mail on Sunday’s readers, should. The 17 criminal charges against me were all abandoned, rejected by jurors, or unanimously vacated by the Supreme Court of the United States.

I won: Jeremy Paxman's accusations were unfounded and ignorant and Ian Hislop is a banana, says former owner of the Daily Telegraph Conrad Black

The authors of the allegations that led to the criminal charges have agreed to pay me $6 million (£3.7 million), almost four times the largest previous libel settlement in Canadian history.

The US Supreme Court remanded back to an appeals judge it had excoriated the vacated counts for assessment of his own errors, to see if any part of the prosecution should survive. The unchastened lower court judge retrieved the two least counts, putting a fig-leaf on the failed prosecution.

I had been sent to prison for three years, where I was a tutor and was able to help more than 100 students. And, with access to emails, I was able to build an American and Canadian weekly readership of my magazine and newspaper columns of about four million. I made the most of a bad hand.

The pitiful vestiges of the case against me are again under appeal, and here I was, wearily listening to the wide-faced priggishness of good old Jeremy. I played my part and recited the facts, somewhat histrionically.

My inquisitor fell back to, ‘But you were convicted.’ More facts, tedious and inconvenient, were called for.

In American prosecutions, 97 per cent of cases result in guilty pleas and avoid trials. And 85 per cent of the three per cent that are tried result in convictions and sentences four times as severe as the sentences of those who waive their constitutional right to a trial.

Inquisitor: Jeremy Paxman interviewed Conrad Black about his time in prison in the U.S.

The procedural rules are terribly uneven in favour of the prosecutors, who speak last to the jury, which relies entirely on its memory, even in a complicated four-month commercial trial like that of my co-defendants and myself.

The great majority of American judges are ex-prosecutors. The conviction rate in the US is 150 per cent that of Canada and almost twice that of the UK, and the prosecutors of both those countries would be disbarred for the plea bargaining-extortion and subornation that is the core of the American system.

In our case, convictions were only produced on the basis of the Honest Services Statute, which was designed to deal with bribes, and was unanimously struck down by the high court as unconstitutional and inapplicable on the facts.

The United States is being milked by an avaricious legal cartel that drains away ten per cent of the annual GDP and terrorised by a lawless prosecutocracy that tore down a six-term US Senator, Ted Stevens, who was subsequently proved to have been framed on the basis of false evidence.

This scandalous official corruption and hypocrisy, which strikes to the heart of America’s claim to be a society of laws and respect for individual liberties, is becoming a matter of journalistic concern in the United States. But none of my interviewers in this busy press week in London seemed to have the least awareness of it.

No contest: Conrad Black disagrees that Ian Hislop got the better of him on Have I Got News For You on Friday

These were the odds I faced in the American courts, 99.5 to one, and this was what I faced in the London media as I promoted my book, A Matter Of Principle. The book recounts the events and the daunting correlation of forces between my legal and journalistic accusers and myself.

This latest trip into the lion’s den began when The Sunday Times cancelled my planned interview with the admirable Eleanor Mills, and sent the notorious Camilla Long in her place to Toronto to write the hit job published there last week. Armed with a box of chocolates and fine photographs of my wife and her dogs, she caused me to agree to the very fair interview in The Mail on Sunday with Elizabeth Sanderson, published on the same day.

Ms Long acted in conformity with the inexplicable Murdoch policy of assailing me at every opportunity since the problem arose (apart from The Wall Street Journal’s magnanimous apology in its leading editorial when I was upheld in the US Supreme Court).

So did Sky’s Adam Boulton, the day after the Paxman encounter, with similarly pyrotechnic results, although time, if not taste or fairness, prevented him from dredging up the Murdochian myth that I had been driven by a spendthrift and overbearing wife (who has in fact been magnificent beyond praise) to prodigies of extravagance.

Boulton could do with a lengthy term in charm school, despite having somehow attracted the lovely Anji Hunter. Love is blind, I guess.

I am grateful for, and accept as an olive branch, Rupert Murdoch’s tweet this week commending my performance at The Daily Telegraph and ascribing my legal travails, accurately, to the betrayal of a former associate.

The rest of the week has been quite civil, although I write without having seen Have I Got News For You. My captain, Paul Merton, and the chairman, Alexander Armstrong, were very gracious, though Ian Hislop, as I suggested to him, has not progressed much beyond his days as editor of Passing Wind.

I will deal with Tom Bower, exhumed briefly by Newsnight, in the Superior Court of Justice in Toronto.

The book has been well launched and the London media have been updated. And I am truly grateful to many British friends for their solidarity through these difficult years since I was last here, especially those who visited and emailed me in prison, and for their hospitality this week. Barbara and I will be back in the New Year, and look forward to it.

Since his return to Britain, Conrad Black has been busy, including appearing on BBC1’s Have I Got News For You on Friday.

The first of his combative altercations with team captain and Private Eye editor Ian Hislop arose from a debate about George Osborne travelling first-class. Host Alexander Armstrong turned this into a discussion about Black’s fortune.

AA: I think I read in Vanity Fair that you said that despite everything you are still worth about $80 million. Is that right?CB:
No, I had said I had lost 80 per cent of my money fighting this 
oppression from the United States government. So he said that leaves you
with $80 million.IH: Did they invade you? I must have missed this.CB:
I said I thought I could live on $80 million if that was what I had. 
You still call it a great office of state you know. Can’t he travel 
first class?IH: We’re still in the middle of this austerity thing. Did you have that?

Have I Got News For You: Ian Hislop on Friday's show

The main battle, however, took place after Black was asked to answer a question about David Cameron’s speech on crime . . .AA: Also this week, what has David Cameron been saying about criminals . . . um . . . Conrad?CB: That in this great United Kingdom those officially so designated may actually have broken the law and that this  is a departure from some transatlantic customs.IH: He didn’t really make a decision that innocent people should not go to jail, did he?CB: Does this require the  truth, Alexander?IH: I know you’re not used to that, Conrad.CB: Not used to hearing it, certainly.IH: What about from the jury?CB: Nine acquittals and they sort of ran out of steam but the Supreme Court made up for it unanimously.IH: No, you didn’t run out of steam, you ran into jail. They found you guilty didn’t they? The jury?CB: Nine acquittals complemented by a unanimous vacation of the four guilty verdicts by the Supreme Court of the US.IH: But two stuck didn’t they? One for fraud and one for obstruction of justice.CB: No, no, oh Ian, please . . .IH: Oh, stop reciting the verdict as though it was true. CB: A little respect for due process, Ian. You’re a banana. [Earlier, Black referred to the Private Eye editor’s famous quote, after losing a libel action: ‘If that’s justice, then I’m a banana.’] IH: I do respect it. I am not  a banana. All I am saying is that you were found guilty.  Of two counts. Which stood. You went to jail. You’ve come back. You would like to be rehabilitated.CB: No, I have been rehabilitated and  I am proud to have been cleared by the Supreme Court unanimously, and I have come here . . . IH: You weren’t cleared! You have come here to say you’re innocent, which is sweet but not true.Panellists were then shown a clip from Jeremy Paxman’s Newsnight interview with Black, in which the peer said he was proud he had endured the tense exchange without ‘getting up and smashing your face in’.AA: Did that feel good?CB: Not as good as doing it .  .  .  No .  .  . I like Jeremy, he’s just  an a**hole, that’s all.IH: It’s unbelievable you get away with that really – a man asking you questions about being a fraudster, and you just say, ‘He’s an a**hole.’
