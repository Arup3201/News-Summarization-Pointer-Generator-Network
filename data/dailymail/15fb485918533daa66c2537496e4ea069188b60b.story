It is not very often that you can get a camera this close to deadly molten lava - especially while it oozes into the Pacific Ocean.

However, a 51-year-old extreme landscape photographer from Hawaii braved the rough waters  during a brief period of calm and managed to capture the Kilauea volcano eruption in all its glory.

The stunning footage - taken somewhere in between Waikupanaha and the Hawaii Volcano National Park, off the coast of the Big Island - is almost therapeutic to watch as fiery fluid plunges underwater where it will transform into land. 

A hot situation: Molten lava  from the erupting Kilauea volcano pours into the Pacific Ocean off Hawaii

Recalling his time filming the scene in April 2013,  Kawika Singson says: 'On this particular day the ocean was fairly calm and my window of opportunity was there, so I took it.

'You can also see this crazy thrill-seeking kayaker in the foreground. He probably was saying the same thing about me: "Who's that crazy dude with the camera?".' 

Molten matter is hotter than 1,650 degrees Fahrenheit (900 Celsius), according to the U.S. Geological Survey.

Surrounded by clouds of poisonous smoke in the clip, the way the lava drools from Kilauea looks like something from the set of Game of Thrones.

Seizing the opportunity: Hawaiian photographer Kawika Singson took advantage of the waters being calmer than normal and waded in to produce this footage in April 2013

Daredevil: The 51-year-old remained only a short distance from the lava flow and made sure to wear protective gear to prevent burning

It's amazing to think that this hyperactive volcano - the youngest on Hawaii's Big Island - has been erupting continuously since 1983.

Indeed, the way that the bright orange liquid contrasts against the blue palette of the ocean and sky, makes for one of the most powerful and picturesque visions that nature has to offer.

Speaking to The Huffington Post, Kawika  remembers just how difficult it was to get close to lava and the importance of keeping safe by staying 'on top of your game'.

The daredevil says: 'The videos can only show you so much, but to actually be there, to feel the heat. ... The heat is one thing, but the gases are extremely toxic.'

However, Kawika is very experienced in his field and owns all the right gear - including fireproof boots and long-sleeved clothing to prevent severe burning.

'Sometimes, after a day of filming, I shake my head and think, man, that was pretty stupid to do what I just did,' he adds. 

'Still, that's not going to stop me from doing what I want to do.'

'Sometimes I think that was pretty stupid!' Looking back, the Hawaain local cannot believe some of the dangerous situations he puts himself into
