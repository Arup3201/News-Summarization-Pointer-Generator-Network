A Porsche driver who has avoided paying a staggering 35 parking fines over the last two years has been slapped with an £800 penalty after failing to buy a 60p parking ticket.

Jason MacLeod, 34, has avoided £2,000 of fines by appealing every parking ticket he has been issued with since 2010, at a cost of £10,000.

The software developer says he disagrees with the 'principle' of the fines, claiming they are 'disproportionate.'

'Matter of principle': Porsche driver Jason MacLeod has avoided £2,000 of fines by appealing every parking ticket he has been issued with since 2010, but has finally been told to pay his latest one

Instead of just 'rolling over' like most drivers, he has researched legal technicalities, written extensive letters of explanation and contested his fines at tribunals.

He has even brawled on the floor with a burly parking boss he confronted over his car being clamped.

But Jason has now finally been ordered to pay out £790 after losing his appeal against a £50 excess charge for parking his Porsche without a ticket in a supermarket car park.

Despite the set-back, he has vowed to continue fighting his parking penalties - and even plans to take his case to the crown court to appeal the fine.

Jason, of Stratford, London, said: 'It is a matter of principle, the money is not an issue. I have got no problem paying a 60p parking ticket.

'It was a genuine mistake and now I have been stung for £790. I would have got less if I had broken someone’s nose.

One-man war: Two years ago, Mr MacLeod grappled with a burly parking boss after trying to serve him court papers which showed the clamper owed him £400 in damages after a two-year row over a wheel clamping

Taking matters into his own hands: Mr MacLeod was pictured being thrown to the ground in the fight with parking enforcement firm boss Richard Rippon outside Mr Rippon's home in Poole, Dorset

'If a proper crown court judge was to hear me put my arguments forward I think it would be a whole different playing field. Most people just roll over when they get a parking ticket.

'But I never intentionally park in the wrong place so if I think I have a case I appeal. I’ve known parking wardens stand over people’s cars waiting for the time on their ticket to run out.

'It’s frustrating as motorists are being levied excessive penalties for usually minor parking misdemeanours. The system is biased against them. But I’m not afraid to fight for it.'

Huntingdonshire District Council accused the computer expert of parking his black Porsche Cayman S in Sainsbury’s car park without displaying a ticket last April.

He was ordered to pay the excess charge of just £35, but refused and the total due on the notice rose to £50.

Mr MacLeod still refused to pay and challenged the ticket in a hearing at Huntingdon Magistrates’ Court, on 20 December 2012.

Ouch: He estimates the equivalent to half a working day in total is spent on each appeal

He told the court he thought he was 
parked in an area separate to the supermarket car park that had no 
restrictions, but the decision was awarded in favour of the district 
council.

Magistrates fined 
the driver £400 and ordered him to pay £375 costs and a £15 victim after
being found guilty of the non-criminal, non-recordable motoring 
offence.

The failed appeal is the first time Jason has been ordered to pay a fine since 2010.

Since
2004, he has been issued with 67 parking tickets, of which 60 were from
councils, while the others were due to private firms.

He
estimates the equivalent to half a working day in total - when he would
charge his executive rates as a consultant - is spent on each appeal.

The lost time and other legal and administrative costs come to at least £10,000, just since 2010.

Racking them up: Some of the 67 parking tickets Mr MacLeod has been issued with since 2004, of which 60 were from councils and the others from private firms

Over the last two years, Jason has appealed 35 parking fines and been successful 34 times.

He has paid five of these up front then later written to claim a reimbursement.

Jason has been successful in 26 of his
claims over the last two years and still has eight decisions pending - 
which means he has yet to pay.

Over the eight-year period, he has been clamped eleven times and his car has been towed twice.

The technicalities he has used to appeal 
the penalties include improper signage, faded road markings and wardens 
operating beyond their jurisdiction.

But he says the £2,100 he has saved by
not paying fines is unimportant next to the principle of wardens 
'actively trying' to catch drivers out.

Mr
MacLeod, who earns a six-figure salary, said: 'If I genuinely break a 
parking restriction then I am always happy to pay the fine.

'But I appeal most of them because I am a conscientious parker and always try and check the restrictions where I leave my car.

'If I get a fine it can be because the local signs or road markings are inadequate.

'Occasionally I have been less than five minutes late getting back to my car because I have been held up.

'Other times, I have been unloading my car, and once my car was even towed away after it had broken down.

'There is no leeway, or discretion, and lots of times I have seen wardens stood over my car waiting for the time on the ticket to run out.

'I know I’ve got a point because so many of my fines have been overturned.'

In 2010 Jason was pictured being thrown to the ground by burly parking enforcement firm boss Richard Rippon.

He was trying to serve the parking boss court papers which showed the clamper owed him £400 in damages after a two-year row over a wheel clamping.

Jason rang Redroute Parking Management to pay a £125 fine he incurred in Reading in 2008 so the clamp could be removed from his car, but was asked for his name and address.

When he refused to give his name and address, he was told a tow truck would remove his car and he would have to stump up a further £129 to cover the call-out charge.

Jason paid the company a total of £254, but took the matter to Aldershot and Farnham County Court, Hants, which ruled in his favour and awarded £400 in damages.

The driver then traced Mr Rippon to his home in Poole, Dorset, and tried to give him the enforcement papers when the pair became locked in a tussle.

Mr Rippon, 50, claimed he acted in self-defence and was upset that Mr MacLeod was acting aggressively and taking pictures of him and his daughter.

The money due to Jason under the court order was paid on the spot.
