It’s Doctor Who – but there’s no need to hide behind the sofa.

To mark Halloween and the 50th birthday of the BBC show, an adorable two-year-old girl dressed up as all 11 of the Doctors, from the original, played by William Hartnell, to 2013’s Matt Smith.

Katie Kent, from Dallas, Texas, modelled the costumes after her father, Todd, had spent months scouring the internet for them.

He posted the pictures on his Comic Book Literacy blog in a gallery called ‘Happy Wholloween’, alongside pictures of the Doctors that the costumes mimic.

He told MailOnline that the photos took several months to put together.

He said: ‘Most clothing items were bought surprisingly cheaply on eBay. Each item was only around a dollar or two. I started looking for costume items around February of this year so it took several months to compile everything.'

'We also took the pictures over the course of several months. Whenever it was time for Katie to go outside and play we would dress her up in an outfit and head out. I would just follow her around with the camera and take about 30 to 40 pictures per outfit with the hopes of getting two good pics that would work for the blog.'

Katie dressed as William Hartnell, who played 
the Doctor in the first series, which aired in 1963. He bowed out three 
years later

Patrick Troughton 
became the second doctor in November 1966 in the 'regeneration' process. He described his Doctor as a ‘Cosmic Hobo’, who would play a recorder when stressed

Mr Kent explained that Katie liked wearing all the costumes, but the ones with big coats in particular.

He said: 'She likes to play dress up so she seemed to like most of them, especially the ones with long coats. I think both our favourite may be the sixth Doctor's outfit. She liked the colours and I love how the outfit came together. It was the most challenging to make. My wife is a talented seamstress and she made the coat herself.'

The show has been a hit with Mr Kent for a long time.

He added: 'I've been watching Doctor Who since I was a child. Shortly after Katie's birth we started a complete re-watch of the entire series from the very first Hartnell episode. We usually watch one serial per weekend together but so far have only made it up to the fourth Doctor. Katie likes the theme song and claps along to it when we watch.'

Peter Capaldi has been revealed as the twelfth incarnation of Doctor Who.

The 55-year-old actor, best known for playing Malcolm Tucker in The Thick Of It, was announced as the new Time Lord in a live BBC TV special in August.

The Scot's appointment came two months after Matt Smith, 30, announced he was quitting following four years as the time-traveller.

Matt, who joined the show in 2010, will appear in his last scenes in the Christmas Special, with the Peter appearing in 2014, joining current assistant Jenna Coleman, who plays Clara.

Jon Pertwee's Doctor, who hit screens in 1970, was a little more action-packed than his predecessors and was predisposed towards slightly frilly shirts

In 1974 Tom Baker arrived as the Time Lord, with his trademark long scarf and trilby. He was perhaps one of the most popular Doctors

Peter Davison stepped up to the Doctor Who plate in 1981. He was known for his role in All Creatures Great and Small and outfit-wise went for a cricketing look

Another Baker played the Doctor in 1984, this time with the first name of Colin. He wore colourful outfits and had a larger-than-life personality

Sylvester McCoy took the Tardis helm in 1987 and in 1989 viewers watched what was apparently the final episode in the series' 26-year-run, with McCoy and his assistant walking off into the distance... but the show would return

The series was revived in 1996 with Paul McGann chosen to wield the sonic screwdriver and command the Tardis. He was much-loved by UK viewers but the series didn't fare so well in America

The ninth Doctor was  Christopher Eccleston, who brought his tough-guy persona to the role, with Billie Piper as his companion. Katie is pictured here wheeling around in the leather jacket he wore

David Tennant was the 10th Doctor and an incredibly popular one. Tennant is a brilliant actor and fans were disappointed to see him go. Katie looks the part here in a stylish coat and suit

Matt Smith emerged from regeneration in 2010 and will leave this Christmas, to be replaced by The Thick Of It actor Peter Capaldi, who was revealed in a BBC special
