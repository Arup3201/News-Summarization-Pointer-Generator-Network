When people are in a bad mood, they are more likely to actively search social networking sites like Facebook to find friends who are doing even worse than they are.

That's according to a study that found that, in general, people use social media to connect with people who are posting positive and success-oriented updates. 

But when they were in a negative spiral they would search for others who were also having a similarly bad day - or worse.

Research led by Ohio State University has found that people in a negative mood like to see others who are also doing badly on social networks. Normally people preferred positive and upbeat statuses. But when upset they looked at people rated unsuccessful or unattractive

The study was published online in the journal Computers in Human Behaviour.

It involved 168 college students, with the researchers first putting participants in a good or bad mood by having them take a test on facial emotion recognition. 

Regardless of their answers, the students were randomly told their performance was 'terrible' to put them in a bad mood or 'excellent' to put them in a good mood.

Afterward, all participants were asked to review what they were told was a new social networking site called SocialLink. 

Earlier this week the California-based firm revealed that it carried out an experiment during a week in 2012.

During that time, negative posts were deprioritised in the data feeds of 689,003 users, to see if it generated a more positive response.

Posts were determined by the experiment to be positive or negative if they contained at least one positive or negative word.

The experiment affected around 0.04 per cent of users - or 1 in 2,500.

According to Facebook, nobody's posts were 'hidden,' they just didn't show up on some feeds.

It found that negative posts elicited a swell of positive responses, but also that a reduction in positive news led to more negative posts.

‘When positive expressions were reduced, people produced fewer positive posts and more negative posts; when negative expressions were reduced, the opposite pattern occurred,’ said the researchers. 

Overall, the researchers found that people tended to spend more time on the profiles of people who were rated as successful and attractive.

But participants who had been put in a negative mood spent significantly more time than others browsing the profiles of people who had been rated as unsuccessful and unattractive.

The overview page presented preview profiles of eight individuals, which the students could click on to read more.

The key to the study was that the eight profiles were designed to make the people profiled appear attractive and successful - or unattractive or unsuccessful.

Each profiled person was ranked on a scale of 0 to 5 on both career success and attractiveness, or 'hotness'. 

The profile images were blurred so that participants could not see what they actually looked like.

When participants clicked on the profiles, they found that all the status updates were much the same.

They were all relatively mundane and didn't discuss any career or academic success, physical appearance or romantic relationships.

The results were based on a fake social network site created by researchers called SocialLink (screenshot shown) where people were rated according to career success and attractiveness. 'If you need a self-esteem boost, you're going to look at people worse off than you,' said author Dr Knobloch-Westerwick

'When people are in a negative mood, they start to show more interest in the less attractive, less successful people on their social media sites,' said Dr Silvia Knobloch-Westerwick, co-author of the study and professor of communication at Ohio State University.

These findings give more context to recent studies that found people who spend a lot of time on Facebook tend to be more frustrated, angry and lonely - perhaps because positive updates from friends make them feel inadequate.

'People have the ability to manage how they use social media,' said Benjamin Johnson, co-author of the study and assistant professor at VU University Amsterdam.

'Generally, most of us look for the positive on social media sites. But if you're feeling vulnerable, you'll look for people on Facebook who are having a bad day or who aren't as good at presenting themselves positively, just to make yourself feel better.'

Dr Knobloch-Westerwick added: 'If you need a self-esteem boost, you're going to look at people worse off than you.

'You're probably not going to be looking at the people who just got a great new job or just got married.

'One of the great appeals of social network sites is that they allow people to manage their moods by choosing who they want to compare themselves to.'
