Manchester City are on the verge of announcing Eliaquim Mangala’s £32million move to the Etihad after confirming that Bruno Zuculini has officially joined the Premier League champions.

The deals will coincide with Javi Garcia leaving City to join Zenit St Petersburg after the Russian club agreed to pay £12m up front for the Spaniard and a further £800,000 in add-ons based on their progress in Europe.

Manager Manuel Pellegrini remained tight-lipped over Mangala’s arrival on Friday, saying: ‘When things are finished we can talk about that. For the moment, Mangala is not our player.’

Composure: The centre-back, one of the most highly-rated young players in Europe, will sign at Etihad for £32m

The 23-year-old France defender passed his medical in Manchester and agreed personal terms nearly a month ago, but his transfer from FC Porto has been held up by complications over third-party ownership.

However, it is understood that protracted negotiations have reached a conclusion and the Frenchman will finally complete his move, seven months after City first tried to sign him in the January transfer window.

Mangala will team up with his former Porto teammate Fernando at City. The Brazilian midfielder said: ‘I’ve played with him for a long time, he’s a great player and a friend as well.

‘He’s very quick and strong, very competitive. He might bring a different element to the team that City doesn’t have, with his characteristics.’

Confirmation of Zuculini’s signing has been equally long in coming. The Argentina Under-21 midfielder joined City from Racing Club for £3m in June and played on the club’s pre-season tour of America, but the deal was only confirmed on Friday night. 

He will go straight into the squad for Sunday’s Community Shield clash with Arsenal at Wembley.

‘I’m very excited about the future,’ said Zuculini, who becomes the fifth Argentine to join City after Sergio Aguero, Pablo Zabaleta, Martin Demichelis and Willy Caballero. ‘I am looking forward to the experiences which this move will bring and to improving myself as a player.’

On the move? Javi Garcia looks set to seal a £12million move to Zenit St Petersburg after City signed Fernando

Meanwhile, Garcia flew to Russia on Friday to discuss personal terms after City agreed a fee with Zenit. The Spain midfielder signed from Benfica for £15.8m in August 2012 but struggled to win a regular first-team place and made just 31 Premier League starts in two years.

The signings of Fernando and Caballero – and imminent arrival of Mangala – meant that City had to cut their quota of foreign players and were prepared to listen to offers for Garcia and Alvaro Negredo.

When Negredo broke a bone in his foot last month, it became clear that Garcia was the odd man out.
