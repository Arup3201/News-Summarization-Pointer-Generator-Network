Possums carry a flesh-eating strain of bacteria in their faeces harmful to humans

Scientists have discovered a strain of bacteria in possum faeces with the potential to cause flesh-eating ulcers in humans. 

Infectious disease researchers at Victoria's Barwon Health have found that the fury critters carry the buruli bacteria - a disease-carrying germ with the potential to cause 'permanent disfigurement and disability' in humans if they come in to contact with it.

In most cases the bacteria leaves people with  major skin ulcers, most prominently on the arms and legs. However depending on the level of human exposure it can potentially render people permanently disabled.

The most recent cases of exposure to the buruli bacteria have been in the Gippsland, Bellarine and Mornington regions in Victoria.

Barwon Health Associate Professor Daniel O'Brien said possum faeces is rich in the bacteria.

He told 774 ABC Melbourne there needs to be more research into whether contact with possum faeces is what causes buruli ulcers, also known as Bairnsdale ulcers, in humans.

'What we know in areas where we're getting infections and possums are infected is that their possum poo does carry a large amount of the organism,' he said.

'What we do think is a good public health measure is to remove the possum faeces from the area as much as possible and wash your hands as much as you can after that to minimise potential exposures.'

The organism that causes the ulcer is in the same family as that which causes tuberculosis and leprosy, according to the World Health Organisation.

'Patients who are not treated early suffer long-term functional disability,' The WHO states.

'Early diagnosis and treatment are the only ways to minimize morbidity and prevent disability.'

Researchers say that a better understanding of the transmission of the disease between possum poo and humans is needed

The infection usually begins as a painless, itchy pimple which then breaks down to form an ulcer.

If treated early the ulcer is curable but if left to spread the condition can be serious, according to Professor O'Brien.

'The treatment is really quite difficult. It often involves a long period of antibiotics which can be difficult to take and often involves surgery.'  

He said people have been infected in Victoria's Gippsland region and the Bellarine Peninsula, and most recently in the Mornington Peninsula.

No infected possums have been detected in metropolitan Melbourne.

Professor O'Brien said a better understanding of how the bacteria is transmitted between the faeces and humans is needed.

'The most important thing for me is that we can prevent this infection, because at the moment we can treat it but we don't really know how to prevent it,' he said.

'When you see young kids coming into the clinic with really nasty ulcers on their arm ... what we really need to do is stop them getting it in the first place.'
