These pictures show the moment a Watford fan was subjected to a sickening attack following his side's draw with Wolves last Saturday.

The supporter,  44-year-old Nick Cruwys, was on his way to Wolverhampton train station from the Molineux stadium when he was assaulted by a gang. He is now fighting for his life in hospital after being placed in an induced coma.

Police, who have arrested an 18-year-old in connection with the attack, said Cruwys was walking to the station with a group of friends when they were 'completely outnumbered' and suffered serious head injuries.

 A fund set up for Cruwys has already raised almost £23,000 through a crowd funding website  

A police statement read: 'We would like to thank the people of Wolverhampton and the wider footballing community from across the country who have already come to us with information. But I would urge anyone else who can help the investigation to contact us as soon as possible.

'Today's arrest is only the start of our investigation and I would also appeal to anyone who was involved in this incident to do the right thing and come forward.'

A group of Wolves supporters were so ashamed of the incident that they set up a website, a page dedicated to raising money to pay for Cruwys's travel and tickets to future matches. 

The initial target was £1,000 but by Wednesday more than 1,700 people had raised almost £23,000.

The victim's brother, Chris, thanked those who have helped.

He said: 'I just wanted to say a massive thank you for all of the kind words, prayers, support and concerns that have been sent through Facebook for my brother.

'Thank you everyone, it's truly overwhelming. Nick is critically ill and fighting for his life. We are taking positivity from every hour that passes without deterioration.

'We all hope that Nick has the strength to battle through this and when he awkens that he has retained all or at least some of the personality that makes him Nick, a husband, a dad, a son, a brother and an uncle or simply Moo.

'Thank you again everyone, your support is appreciated.'

Both Watford and Wolves football clubs expressed their shock at the attack.

A statement on Watford's website said: 'The thoughts of everyone associated with Watford FC are with a Hornets' supporter  who is now critically ill after an unprovoked post-match attack.'

Wolves chief executive Jez Moxey said: 'We are deeply saddened to hear of this incident and our thoughts go out to the supporter concerned and his family.

'As a club we deplore any violence in or around football matches and we will work closely with the relevant authorities to help bring the perpetrator, or perpetrators, to justice.

'All right-minded football supporters will share in our disgust at this violent incident and I would implore anyone with any information to contact the police.'

A West Midlands Police spokesman said: 'Detectives have launched an investigation after a Hertfordshire man received life-threatening injuries in an unprovoked assault in Wolverhampton.

'The 44-year-old was with a group of friends making their way to the train station to return home to Hemel Hempstead just after 5pm when they were attacked in Little's Lane.'

Detective Sergeant Adam Keen added: 'The group of friends were completely outnumbered and the victim suffered a severe head injury which has left him in a critical condition in hospital.

'His family have been informed and we are in the process of taking statements from witnesses and locating any CCTV which might have captured those responsible for the attack.

'I would urge anyone with information which will help our investigation to contact me as soon as possible on 101.' 

Anyone wishing to offer information anonymously should call the Crimestoppers hotline on 0800 555 111.
