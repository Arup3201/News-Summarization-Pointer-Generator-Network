It's known for its crass comedy, but it seems the endless double entendres and sexual references in  '2 Broke Girls' are too much for some fans.

The Federal Communications Commission has received 91 informal complaints about the hit CBS show over the last two years.

Many of the gripes concern the script's 'vulgar language and inappropriate sexual references', overuse of the word 'vagina' and phrases about various sexual positions.

Crass: Federal regulators have received at least 91 complaints over the last two years about the crude sexual double entendres and outright crassness of CBS show, '2 Broke Girls'

'Forced fellatio and ejaculation on a 
woman’s breasts are not prime-time material,' an angry Kentucky viewer wrote, according to documents obtained by the Government Attic website.

Another viewer from Texas opined that the show's vulgarity is 'unrelenting' and the network should take responsibility for what it broadcasts.

'I don’t know 
when TV censorship died in this country but we need it back,' the complaint said.

The bawdy program, created by 'Sex and the City'  producer Michael Patrick King, follows two young waitresses who struggle to fulfill dreams of running their own cupcake business.

Now in its third season, '2 Broke Girls' starring Kat Dennings and Beth Behrs has been a ratings hit for CBS.

EOnline reported the show's last new episode in December 2013 had 7.6 million viewers and a 2.3 rating in the coveted 18-49 demographic.

However, the comedy series is not going down well with some viewers.

One complainant from Massachusetts was annoyed about an episode in which the 
rich, blonde character, Caroline, asks what’s expected on a first date 
with a poor guy. 'A**l', responds another show character.

Many viewers were also outraged that CBS would air commercials featuring the main characters on stripper poles during the Super Bowl.
