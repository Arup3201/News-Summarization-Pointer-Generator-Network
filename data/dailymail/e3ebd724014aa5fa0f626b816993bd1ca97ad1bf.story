A new photo of the shadowy leader of a violent rebel group deemed too radical by Al Qaeda has been released by the Iraqi interior ministry.

The release of the image of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is part of a renewed push by Iraq to catch the man whose militant group, called the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), has carried out attacks responsible for killing a large number of Iraqis.

ISIS is also known for the brutal rule it enforces in the Syrian towns it takes over. Al Qaeda recently released a formal statement distancing itself from the group and its actions.

The Iraqi Government obtained the photograph of Baghdadi along with three handwritten letters, AFP reported.

'The security forces call on the people to provide any information that helps lead to the arrest of this criminal,' said the statement that was posted with the photograph.

ISIS is the most extreme group carrying out attacks against the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, and has fought against other moderate rebel groups in Syria.

Baghdadi is suspected to be living in Syria, where ISIS holds its headquarters in the city of Raqqa.

He is known as 'The Ghost' to members of the pro-Assad Lebanese Shi-ite militia Hizballah.

'Only a few people know the face of Baghdadi,' Sheik Ahmad, the Hizballah official in charge of investigating ISIS in Syria, told TIME last year.

The secretive Baghdadi talks with a scarf covering his face even when dealing with close allies, according to militants who worked with him in Iraq.

He addresses his ISIS followers through audio recordings posted to the internet, rather than in public places.

A recent CNN report about ISISâ€™s brutal rule focussed on the Syrian town of Addana, which was overtaken by ISIS forces before they were driven out a month ago.

Locals said public executions were carried out often and bodies were left to rot in the street.
