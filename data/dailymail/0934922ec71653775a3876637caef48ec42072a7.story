It was Dr Johnson, that most sympathetic observer of human weakness, who said of his friend, the dramatist Oliver Goldsmith: ‘No man was more foolish when he had not a pen in his hand, nor more wise when he had.’

This morning, therefore, offer a kind thought for Kevin Pietersen, who was once an England cricketer. With a bat in his hand he achieved remarkable things. With a pen he fools nobody but himself. And after the ECB document about last winter’s disastrous Ashes tour was leaked on Tuesday, Pietersen looks very foolish indeed.

In case you haven’t heard, Pietersen has just published an autobiography which seeks to ‘blow the lid’ off cricket, in particular the people he used to play with before they tired of him.

Pietersen's autobiography was written with the purpose of blowing the lid off cricket

The former England international did that, but he has also damaged his already soiled reputation beyond repair 

2009: Resigns as England captain after a rift with coach Peter Moores

2010: Fined for an obscene Twitter outburst after being dropped from ODI squad

2012: Sends provocative texts about Andrew Strauss to Proteas 

2012: Reintegrated into team after missing out on a central contract

2014: Sacked after ECB lose patience with his Ashes tour behaviour

He has blown the lid off all right, but at the expense of damaging his own reputation, already soiled, beyond repair.

Even Matt Prior, the England wicketkeeper who feels the full force of Pietersen’s fury, may decide that pity is the most appropriate response. For what the book confirms is the self-willed fall from grace of a cricketer who had the world at his feet yet never learned to show a straighter bat to that world, and who may now be wondering why so many people share Andrew Strauss’s unprintable opinion of his character.

Pietersen’s model for his book seems to be Alice In Wonderland, where words mean what Alice wants them to mean. The world, viewed through the filter of Pietersen’s imagination, is full of little men who were put on earth to halt his progress towards immortality.

What has made cricket-followers roar is Pietersen’s confession that in 2012, a summer disfigured by his betrayal of Strauss, who was then a much-admired England captain, he blubbed in the dressing-room at Headingley after he had made a wonderful century against South Africa. Why? Because he thought some team-mates were involved in a spoof Twitter account which mocked his rampant egotism.

‘I was completely broken, absolutely finished, mentally shot,’ he said (peeling an onion) in an interview to accompany the book launch. Here we go again, everybody. It’s all about me, me, me!

English cricket is full of heroic tales. In 1933, at Brisbane, Eddie Paynter of Lancashire left his sick-bed with a temperature of 102 to make 83 runs that helped win a Test match. Thirty years later, at Lord’s, Colin Cowdrey went out to face the mighty Wes Hall with a broken arm to ensure the West Indies did not win.

Pietersen described Alastair Cook's captaincy of the England cricket team as 'weak' and 'tactically inept'

Most famously, at Headingley in 1981, Ian Botham responded to a run of wretched form that cost him the captaincy by giving the greatest all-round performance in the history of our game to turn a Test, and a series, on its head. Botham’s Ashes, they still call it, and always will. That’s immortality.

Did Paynter say: ‘I shall stay in bed today’? Did Cowdrey say: ‘It’s not worth it’? Did Botham say, as Pietersen did at Leeds: ‘It’s not easy being me in this dressing-room’? Not a trace of it. They pulled on their boots and strapped on their pads. ‘Blubber’ Pietersen, on the other hand, went: ‘Boo hoo hoo, the rotters are being beastly! It’s so unfair!’

The rotters have always been unfair to Pietersen on his ‘incredible journey’ through cricket: my word, how he loves his ‘incredibles’! They forced him out of Natal when he was 20 and have made his life a misery ever since. Only last week, Surrey released him from his contract. It may have had something to do with the fact he was rarely spotted at The Oval. 

Where the England team is concerned, it has been evident for some time that, taken as a group, they are not the most attractive group of players. As for Pietersen’s claims that a culture of ‘bullying’ existed, we shall hear more anon and the revelations from other witnesses may not be in his favour.

Cricketers are not, on the whole, mean-spirited. In a team environment that tests the bonds of friendship or mutual respect, because of the months they are obliged to spend with one another, they tend to be collegiate creatures, happy to rub along with whoever they find alongside them.

So it has always been significant Pietersen has proved unable to find a companionable berth in any dressing-room he has shared.

From Durban to Kennington, by way of Nottingham and Southampton, he has been mistrusted by colleagues who may have tolerated his selfishness but who rarely found a kind word to say for his comradeship. For all his inane prattle about ‘buddies’, Pietersen found few allies and fewer friends. ‘Has our famous batsman failed?’ a Hampshire player asked reporters one day at Southampton after hearing that Pietersen had been dismissed in the Lord’s Test. ‘Oh dear, what a pity. We’re so upset.’

One may judge a man by his friends. One may also judge him by those he perceives to be enemies.

Evidently Pietersen has little time for Andy Flower, the former coach, whose principled opposition to the genocidal Robert Mugabe is well-known; to Strauss, who enjoys the respect of everybody within the game; and to Paul Downton, the managing director of English cricket, who has never made a foe in his life. He also called Hugh Morris, Downton’s predecessor, who fought a courageous battle against cancer, a ‘weak p***k ’.

Upon receiving his 100th cap, Pietersen described the England dressing room in November 2013 as 'the best environment that I have ever experienced' only to then describe and deride a 'bullying' culture within the team

The model for Pietersen's autobiography seems to be Alice in Wonderland... he sees what he wants to see

Clearly he is not the most rounded of men. Unable to sense mood or interpret events in the way that a better balanced person would, he has come to rely on a small army of advisers who have not always served him well. All together now: Me, me me! His friends could have told him that it was unwise to cover his forearms with England tattoos before he had played a single Test for his adopted country.

They could have told him breathless attempts to be pally with famous players usually rebound on the groveller, and that words such as ‘dude’ and ‘buddy’ reveal the speaker to be a twerp.

But they didn’t. Instead Pietersen became cocooned in a tower of illusions and frustrations, railing against a world of deceivers, as self-deceivers often do. Some cricket-lovers are sympathetic, to a degree. Most washed their hands of him a long time ago.

He should have been remembered for his magnificent strokeplay, and indeed his handful of superb innings will be recalled whenever people consider his cricket. But, after this latest shabby exercise in score-settling, the Pietersen story will be known mainly for the lamentations of the most self-obsessed sportsman of our age.

Sir Ronald Harwood, the dramatist and Oscar-winning screenwriter, also came to this country from South Africa, and loves cricket with a passion.

Yesterday, reflecting on the Pietersen imbroglio, he said something magnificent. ‘There is such a thing as the spirit of the game, and that spirit has triumphed, to his disadvantage.’

Meanwhile, somewhere through the looking-glass, Alice wants a friend to hold her hand.
