Traced: Wendy Dye, a flight attendant for Horizon Air, was arrested over a missing iPad

A Nevada man who lost his iPad on an airplane used an app called 'Find My iPad' to locate it inside the home of a flight attendant in Oregon, according to police.

Wendy Ronelle Dye, 43, a flight attendant for Horizon Air, was arrested in Oregon City on Friday evening.

The iPad's owner said he had downloaded the anti-theft app only days before the September 11 flight to Los Angeles, and forgot about its installation until activating it on Wednesday.

While being questioned by police, Dye initially denied having the iPad or knowing one was missing.

The
flight attendant then confessed that a passenger brought her the 
tablet, which cost around $500, saying it had been left on a seat.

She
said she never used the iPad and planned to turn it over to airline 
officials, but placed it in a personal bag and soon forgot about it.

Police say they found some of her personal information on it, however, including a reminder for her husband's upcoming birthday.

Arrangements are being made to return the tablet to its owner in Reno.

Finders keepers: Dye admitted that a Horizon passenger had found the iPad left on a seat and presented it to her but she failed to report it to officials

Change of story: Dye said she hadn't used the iPad and planned to give it back but police say her personal information was already on it

Dye, who is charged with Theft II by receiving and Computer Crime, did not immediately respond to a phone message.

A spokeswoman for Alaska Airlines, which owns Horizon, says Dye was suspended pending the police investigation.

She was being held at the Clackamas County Jail with bail set at $12,500.
