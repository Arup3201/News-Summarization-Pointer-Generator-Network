Squatters who have taken over grade-II listed mansion in one of London's most expensive neighbourhoods today claimed they are of benefit to the building's owner.

The 300-year-old property built in 1699 on Mare Street in Hackney has been sitting empty for several years but has recently been taken over by a developer.

But around 10 squatters have taken up residence in the Georgian villa and are now suggesting that they can come to an 'arrangement' with the owner that would be of 'mutual benefit'. 

New 'residents': Approximately 10 squatters have moved in to 195 Mare Street, a Grade II listed Georgian villa built in 1699, shortly after a new developer bought the property

They placed a note in one of the building's windows stating: 'We are very willing to negotiate an arrangement for our mutual benefit.

'There are numerous benefits for having squatters in a disused building, we can provide/assist in upkeep, ensure security of the building and provide monetary benefits.'

While some neighbours appear to have welcomed the squatters, others were frustrated that people are living rent-free while other residents pay thousands of pounds in rent every month.

Michelle Watkins, 36, who runs a pop-up shop, told the Evening Standard: 'We all work really hard. It’s not right - this is a prime location. The rent for my three-bed flat which I share is £2,400 a month.'

Fed up: Hackney resident William Cheshire wants the building, which has sat empty since 2003, to be put to good use with a 'permanent solution'

Another resident, film maker Dave Aspinall, 34, revealed he pays £1,900 a month for a one bedroom flat.

While jewellery designer William Cheshire, who has lived in Hackney for 14 years, is fed up with the building being empty but wants a 'permanent solution to do it justice'. 

This is not the first time the building, which has been closed down since 2003, has been taken over by squatters.

For its first 150 years, the house was one of many grand family homes on Mare Street.

In 1860 it became the Elizabeth Fry Institute for Reformation of Women Prisoners. The Institute closed in 1913 and was then replaced by a working men’s club, the Lansdowne Liberal and Radical Club which later became the New Lansdowne Social Club and closed down in 2003.

Since then several developers have taken over the property, with one gaining permission to convert it into a restaurant and luxury flats.

But each venture failed and by 2009 the building was still sitting empty and squatters moved in.

The squatters organised community events and workshops until they were evicted a year later.

While residential squatting is now a criminal offence, the currently law doesn't apply to commercial buildings.

The new squatters say they also want to see the building used to the benefit of the community.

Derelict: The squatters say they want the building to be used to the benefit of the local community instead of just sitting empty while developers 'wait for it to fall down'

One of the new 'residents' Max, 23, originally from south-west London, told the Standard: 'The land is probably worth more than the building... there is insurmountable damage and the costs to repair it would be a lot greater so the developer is waiting for it to fall down. We have not seen him, he has not been round.

'If they wanted to fix it up and open it to the community then we would have no problem with that - it’s the wasting we have a big issue with.'

He added that they also hoped to campaign against proposed changes to the law which would make squatting in any type of property illegal.
