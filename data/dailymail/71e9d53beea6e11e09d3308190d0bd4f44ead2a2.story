A life-sized cocaine-snorting Oscar statue was displayed on Hollywood Boulevard just days before the street will be filled with glamorous stars for the Academy Awards.

Los Angeles-based artist who calls himself Plastic Jesus placed his public art at the end of Hollywood Boulevard on Thursday, right where the street is expected to close for Sunday's awards ceremony. 

His statue was removed as official Academy Award statues were being put up in almost the same location.

The fiberglass statue - on its hands and knees holding a rolled $100 bill and facing two lines of what looks like cocaine - rests atop a platform that has its own red carpet and a plaque that reads, 'Hollywood's Best Party'.

A statement accompanied the public art and was written by photographer Nick Stern, who works with Plastic Jesus, according to Flavor Wire. 

Stern said the piece comment's on 'Hollywood's hidden problem of drug addiction that effects hundreds of people in the showbiz industry and is largely ignored until a death of a high-profile A-list celebrity'. 

Hours after the statue was displayed on Thursday, Harris Wittels, the co-executive producer of NBC's Parks and Recreation, was found dead from apparent drug overdose just after saying he was clean.

Cocaine is as big of an issue in the world, Plastic Jesus told New York Daily News.  

'The piece is really just to show how much a part of everyday life for people cocaine is,' Plastic Jesus said. 'In the current war on drugs, this isn't working. The term controlled substance is an absolutely joke'

'We're deluded if we're saying that cocaine isn't a major part of Hollywood and almost every other city in the world,' he said. 'A lot of people will sit down and watch the Oscar show this Sunday and then go and indulge in cocaine.' 

The artist said he wanted to 'create controversy' about the issue and plans to place the statue on Melrose Avenue the day of the Academy awards.

'The piece is really just to show how much a part of everyday life for people cocaine is,' he told New York Daily News. 'In the current war on drugs, this isn't working. The term controlled substance is an absolutely joke. There is absolutely no control.'

This isn't the artist's first Oscar stunt.

Last year he created a Oscar Statue injecting heroin, with a plaque reading 'Hollywood's Best Kept Secret'

After the statue was taken down on Thursday afternoon, crew members for the Academy Awards swarmed the area to set up for the big night

After the statue was taken down on Thursday afternoon, crew members for the Academy Awards swarmed the area to set up for the big night.

Multiple official Oscar statues - big and small - were brought to the area on Friday to decorate the red carpet and the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel. 

The hotel is across the street from TCL Chinese Theatre, right in the heart of Hollywood and security will be tight in the area. 

On Thursday, a bomb scare briefly closed down the nearby Hollywood and Highland intersection, at the end of a stretch of Hollywood Boulevard that was sealed off for the week for the show.

One unwelcome guest could be rain - forecasts say there is a 60 per cent chance of what is a rare LA phenomenon. 

Last year, a last-minute freak storm forced organizers to scramble to make sure it didn't rain on the party.
