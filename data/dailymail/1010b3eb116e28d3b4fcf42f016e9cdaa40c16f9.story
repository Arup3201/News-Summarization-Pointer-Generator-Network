Several al-Qaeda militants are on the loose today after tunneling their way out of a Yemeni prison in the second spectacular jailbreak this year.

Up to 15 convicts in the jail in Aden, southern Yemen, escaped early on Monday, according to a prison officer.

A security official said 15 militants fled in the prison break, including 12 convicted for the killing of security officials and a bank heist.

Jailbreak: The latest reports of prisoners escaping jail in Aden, Yemen is the fourth reported jailbreak in the country in the past eight years, and the second in six months.

The discrepancy in the number of escaped prisoners could not be immediately reconciled. Both officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media.

Yemen, the Arab world's poorest nation, has been wrecked by months of political turmoil and unrest.

A popular uprising against longtime President Ali Abdullah Saleh's rule - inspired by other Arab Spring revolts that toppled autocratic rulers in Egypt and Tunisia - has been met by a fierce government crackdown.

The crackdown triggered widespread defections earlier this year by soldiers and officers who joined the protest movement.

Powerful tribes and their armed fighters also turned against Saleh and waged battles against his forces.

Nearly a year of protests demanding the ousting of Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh, punctuated by bouts of fighting between his forces and tribesmen and military units who oppose him, have seen Islamists gain power in the south.          

Deteriorating security in the area, where parts of the Abyan province are under control of Islamist fighters, have fanned fears in Saudi Arabia and Washington - which long backed Saleh in its campaign against al Qaeda - that the Yemeni branch of the group may gain a foothold near key oil shipping routes.

Saleh's foes have accused him of deliberately letting Islamists in the south grow stronger to reinforce his argument that his rule alone can prevent the country sliding into chaos that would empower al Qaeda, whose Yemeni wing has planned abortive attacks on U.S. and other targets.  

Yemen is also home to al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, which the U.S. considers the terrorist network's most active and dangerous offshoot.

Islamic militants with links to the group have taken advantage of the country's turmoil to seize control of several towns in southern Yemen.

Yemen has seen spectacular jailbreaks before.

In 2003, 11 al-Qaeda militants convicted for the 2000 bombing of the USS Cole, which killed 17 American sailors and injured 39 others, escaped from the Aden prison.

In 2006, 23 al-Qaeda militants broke out of a detention facility in Sanaa, including Nasser al-Wahishi, who went on to become the leader of al-Qaeda's Yemeni offshoot.

And in June, nearly 60 suspected al-Qaeda militants tunneled their way out of a prison in the southern Mukalla city.

Investigations into these breakouts and subsequent trials showed that some prison security officers were involved in helping the convicts flee and several officers have been jailed.
