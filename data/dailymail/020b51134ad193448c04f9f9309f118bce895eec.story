Drunken: Daniel Cooper, 24, from Holywell in North Wales admitted indecent exposure after he was caught having sex with a Land Rover Discovery

A father who was caught having sex with a Land Rover while on a night out has been banned from going out at the weekend.

A court heard how drunken Daniel Cooper, 24, stripped off while out with friends.

The father of three was seen urinating in the street before walking down the High Street in Holywell, Wales, with his trousers round his ankles and his t-shirt pulled above his head.

He then shocked fellow revellers by walking into a kebab shop and simulating sex with the counter of the takeaway.

Married Cooper, described as being a 'caring family man', then dropped to the floor and began doing the same.

He then left the shop and gyrated against a Land Rover Discovery that was parked nearby

Cooper says he was so drunk he could not remember what happened - until he was shown the CCTV pictures of his actions.

Police arrested jobless Cooper in Holywell town centre on the night of the August 18 following his shocking actions.

He told officers he was not used to drinking and had gone out with only £13 in his pocket.

Cooper, of Springfields, Holywell, admitted indecent exposure when he appeared at Flintshire Magistrates Court sitting at Mold.

He
 was given a three-month community order which bans him from going 
outdoors between 7pm and 7am on Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights for 
the next three months.

He was also ordered to pay £85 costs.

Speaking in court, prosecutor John Wylde said: 'First of all he was seen to be urinating.

'He was then seen to go down the High Street with his trousers around his ankles and his T-shirt pulled up over his head.

'Cooper was waving at cars and then took off his shirt completely.

'He was seen to enter a kebab shop 
where he was simulating the sex act against the corner of the counter. 
At one stage he lay on the ground and simulated the sex act.

'Then he did the same to a Land Rover Discovery vehicle which was parked nearby.'

Gary Harvey, defending, said: 'My client is mortified and totally ashamed. He cannot recall what had occurred.

'He is a responsible family man who looks after the children while his wife went out to work.'

Cooper has changed his name to 'Daniel Hotc**k Cooper' on his Facebook page sincebeing arrested.

His sex act with the counter of the kebab shop was filmed by some of Cooper’s friends but was later deleted.

One of his pals said: 'Daniel will never live this down - everyone is saying he was tyred and exhausted afterwards.

'He is not a pretty sight when naked. We all felt sorry for the LandRover and hope it wasn’t offended.'
