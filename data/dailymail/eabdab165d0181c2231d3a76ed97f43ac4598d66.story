A burlesque dancer who says she was 'banned' from collecting cash for the Royal British Legion because of her 'inappropriate' costume says she is outraged by the decision.

Jo Freestone, 47, who has raised money for the charity for the last 20 years, usually wears a military-style burlesque costume to gather donations in the town of Sherborne, Dorset.

But the dance teacher has now apparently been told to ditch the outfit in favour of a conservative look more in keeping with the upmarket town.

Jo Freestone who has collected for the poppy appeal for 20 years in Sherborne, Dorset, has been banned because of her 'inappropriate' outfit

The mother-of-three decided to raise her profile in 2010 by wearing the outfit for collections, but the local branch of the British Legion has held a vote which decided her choice of clothing was 'inappropriate'.

Furious Jo, who performs as a dancer under the name of her alter ego 'Major Outrage', said she was shocked by the decision.

She said: 'I’m fuming, this really has upset me.

The mother-of-three, who performs under the stage name of 'Major Outrage', said she was upset by the decision

'I’ve no idea why it’s happened, someone should have had the guts to talk to me about it and invite me to discuss the issue with them.'

Jo Freestone says collecting money in the unusual attire has enabled her to raise hundreds of pounds since 2010

The 47-year-old runs a local dancer troupe called the ‘Barmy Burlesque’ and says her burlesque outfit had helped to make her collections 'successful'.

However, following the vote by local British Legion members which saw 28 of the 30 members deem the unusual choice of clothing 'inappropriate', the future of her money-raising in the outfit looked to be in doubt.

But fortunately for Mrs Freestone, the main body of the charity has now stepped in.

A spokesperson for the Royal British Legion has maintained that the mother-of-three will, in fact, be allowed to continue to wear her outfit when making collections.

The spokesman said: 'The Royal British Legion is delighted to reassure Mrs Freestone that she is not 'banned' from collecting for the Poppy Appeal. The decision of organisers in Sherborne has no validity and Mrs Freestone is absolutely welcome to collect for the welfare of our proud British Armed Forces wherever, whenever, and in whatever outfits she pleases.

'We are confident that her cheeky and artistic burlesque costumes, in particular 'Major Outrage', will bring a smile to the faces of the public as they donate generously to the care and support of our Armed Forces family, in the certain knowledge that the Poppy Appeal supported by people up and down the UK representing all walks of life – burlesque performers most definitely included.

'We apologise to Mrs Freestone for any upset that may have been caused and look forward to seeing her collecting on the streets of Sherborne come November.'

Jo, whose family were in the armed forces, has backed her unusual selling technique and said it was not intended to offend anyone.

She said: 'My grandfather was a professional Shakespearean actor and a Second World War officer.

'He used to keep the spirits of his troops high with entertainers so what I’m doing is respecting what he used to do, I’m not making fun of anyone.

'I think it takes a lot of guts to dress like that and I’ve only ever had praise for it.

'It’s successful because it’s so unique, it’s so different and people want to donate more because they can see you’ve made an effort.'

Mr Haynes, the Poppy Appeal organiser for Sherborne, declined to comment on the matter but said: 'All I’m worried about is getting the poppies out there.

'Sherborne is quite an ageing population with many retiring military people.'
