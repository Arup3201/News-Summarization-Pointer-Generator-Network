A flying saucer flew high over the Pacific off Hawaii on Saturday as Nasa tested a new vehicle that could one day be used to transport people to Mars.

The test drive of the Low Density Supersonic Decelerator, which was carried 120,000ft (23 miles) into the sky by a helium balloon, was considered a success despite the parachute not fully working.

Cheers in the control room as the vehicle launched from the island of Kauai quickly died down however, when it became clear that the new inflatable braking system had failed to property unfurl.

NASA officials were still pleased with
 the flight for the $150 million experiment, and said it was a
 pretty good test of technology that might one day be used to deliver 
heavy spacecraft - and eventually astronauts - to Mars.

The
 space agency also hopes that the new craft could one day replace the 
same parachute design in use since the twin Viking spacecraft landed on 
the red planet in 1976.

Saturday's launch over Hawaii was the first successful attempt after previous flights were marred by strong winds that could have blown the craft into no-fly zones.

Technology needs to advance, or else humanity won't be able to fly beyond the International 
Space Station in low-Earth orbit, according to Michael Gazarik, head of space 
technology, at NASA headquarters.

'Technology development 'is the surest path to Mars,' Gazarik said at a June briefing.

Viewers around the world followed 
portions of the mission in real time over the internet thanks to cameras
 on board the vehicle that beamed back low-resolution footage as it 
ascended over the Hawaiian island of Kauai.

After
 taking off at 11.40am from the Pacific Missile Range Facility, the 
balloon boosted the disc-shaped vehicle over the Pacific.

Its rocket motor ignited, carrying the vehicle at supersonic speeds to an altitude of 34 miles above the surface.

The environment this high up is similar 
to the thin Martian atmosphere, where NASA still uses 1970s technology 
to bring rovers and other devices onto the Martian surface.

'We want to test them here where it's 
cheaper before we send it to Mars to make sure that it's going to work 
there,' project manager Mark Adler of the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory
 said during a pre-launch news conference in Kauai in early June.

When
 it prepared to drop back the Earth, a tube around the vehicle was 
supposed to have expanded like a Hawaiian puffer fish, creating 
atmospheric drag to dramatically slow it down from Mach 4, or four times
 the speed of sound.

The parachute, which on this occasion failed to fully unfurl, is used to guide the vehicle to a safe ocean splashdown.

At 110ft in diameter, the parachute is twice as big as the one that carried the 1-ton Curiosity rover through the Martian atmosphere in 2011.

Engineers planned to analyze the data and conduct several more flights next year before deciding whether to fly the vehicle and parachute on a future Mars mission.

The Saturday launch over Hawaii took the spacecraft 23 miles above the surface and into the Earth's atmosphere

Conditions at that altitude are similar to those on Mars
