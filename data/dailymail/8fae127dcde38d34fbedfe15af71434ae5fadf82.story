A controlling husband was facing life imprisonment for strangling his wife in a jealous rage after she started a relationship with a new man, a court heard.

Andrew Leigh was convicted of the murder of his estranged wife of eight years, Luna, 42, after learning she had started dating someone new.

After she spurned his reconciliation attempts the 'controlling' 42-year-old drugged the pretty brunette with sleeping pills before throttling her in her bed.

Her body was discovered 'cold as ice' in the former martial home in Pype Hayes, Birmingham on June 29 this year.

Leigh, a telecommunications engineer, had denied murder, but a jury disbelieved his version of events and found him guilty after a 10 day trial at Birmingham Crown Court.  

The court heard Leigh had moved out of the property around a year ago but wanted to rekindle his relationship with Luan but she had 'moved on.'

In a jealous revenge attack he then drugged her with sleeping pills before strangling her to death in her own bed.

Prosecutor Rachel Brand QC said: 'It was about 6.45am on June 29 when the defendant rang his wife's sister, a woman called Natasha Chamberlain.

'His opening remark was 'I am really sorry, Natasha, but your sister has passed away.'

'Natasha replied: 'What the hell do you mean? What has happened?'

'He told her he found her dead in bed at about 10.30pm the previous evening but did not call an ambulance because he did know what to do at the time.

'He had killed his wife.

'When the ambulance arrived on the Sunday morning, Luan Leigh was as cold as ice.'

Jurors were told Leigh had drugged his wife on the Saturday evening with the over-the-counter sleeping pills Nytol, which contain antihistamines.

Traces of the main ingredients of Nytol were found in Mrs Leigh's blood during her post-mortem.

Ms Brand said: 'We do not how much was given to Luan...but we do she was drugged.

The jury heard that Leigh drugged Luna before strangling her in her home in Pype Hayes, Birmingham, West Midlands

'Police found the empty packet of tablets, along with their receipt and instructions of use in the house.

'He was on CCTV buying Nytol in the Lloyds pharmacy in Walmley on the Saturday morning.'

The court heard Leigh had become aware Luan was dating somebody else after going through her iPhone and trying to hack her Facebook account.

Ms Brand added: 'Luan told her sister and friends that he once locked her in her garage in a bid to get back together.

'He had also tried to hack into her Facebook account.

'About one week before her death, Luan told Andrew that she did not want him to go on a family holiday and gave him his money back. She wanted to take her mother instead.

'It transpired that the defendant had been snooping around her mobile phone on the evening of Saturday June 25.

'She had just starting seeing someone else and the defendant found out about it.

'He did not move on.'

During his trial, Leigh claimed he killed his wife by accident.

He told the jury he wanted to try and get Luan's iPhone to 'find the truth' about her relationship with the other man and bought some Nytol, and put two tablets into her tea.

Leigh said his estranged wife had gone upstairs and when he checked she appeared to be asleep and he found her iPhone under her pillow.

However as he was leaning over her, he said, she woke up and lunged at him.

He told the jury: 'I grasped her neck and held her momentarily and I then pushed her back down on the bed.'

Speaking after the verdict, Detective Inspector Warren Hines, of West Midlands Police, said: 'The couple has been married for around eight years, but had been together for 22 years and were still friends, despite the split..

'However Luan found Leigh to be controlling and was encouraging him to move on with his life.

'Andrew Leigh was controlling and overbearing and he did not accept that his marriage to Luan was over.

'He has, through his actions, deprived Luan's family of a much loved daughter, sister and friend.

'I very much hope that today's verdict will in some small way allow Luan's family to start rebuilding their lives after the terrible events of June this year.'

Leigh was due to be sentenced tomorrow/ on Friday.
