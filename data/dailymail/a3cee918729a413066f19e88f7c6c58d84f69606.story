Lt. Col. Robert Hite, one of the three remaining Doolittle Raiders, died after a battle with Alzheimer's disease on Sunday, aged 95 

One of the last surviving Doolittle Raiders who attacked Japan during a daring World War II mission has died, age 95.

Lt. Col. Robert Hite died on Sunday at a nursing home in Nashville after a battle with Alzheimer's disease. 

He was one of three remaining Doolittle Raiders. 

Hite was a co-pilot of a crew that flew one of the 16 B-25 bombers that raided Tokyo in April 1942.

Led by Lieutenant Colonel James 'Jimmy' Doolittle, the mission saw 80 airmen sent in bombers from a carrier at sea to attack military targets in Japan. 

Without enough fuel to reach a safe landing point, the brave crew had to land in China and hope villagers would lead them to safety.

Though the attack only caused scattered damage, it's credited with boosting morale in the United States while shaking Japan's confidence less than five months after the country attacked Pearl Harbor.

Tom Casey, a manager for the Doolittle Raiders, said that, despite the risks, 'they all volunteered to go anyway.'

The 16 B-25 bombers, each carrying five men, dropped bombs on targets such as factory areas and military installations.  

Prisoner: Hite, shown here being led blindfolded by his captors, was was taken captive by the Japanese for 40 months after the Doolittle Raid

Veteran: After being liberated in 1945, Hite continued his active-duty service in 1951 during the Korean War. He served until 1955

They then headed to designated airfields in mainland China realizing that they would run out of fuel, according to the National Museum of the U.S. Air Force.

Three crew members died as Raiders bailed out or crash-landed their planes in China, but most were helped to safety by Chinese villagers and soldiers.

Of the eight Raiders captured by Japanese soldiers, three were executed and another died in captivity, according to Northwest Florida Daily News.

Hite was one of the men that was taken by the Japanese and was held captive for 40 months.

Risky: Without enough fuel to reach a safe landing point, the brave crew had to land in China and hope villagers would lead them to safety

After being liberated by American troops in 1945, he returned to active duty six years later, in 1951 During the Korean War. He served until 1955.

Hite's son, Wallace Hite, told Fox News that his father would want to be remembered for being patriotic. 

'I think he would want two things: that's the attitude we ought to have about our country, and the second is, he was doing his job,' he said. 

After Hite's passing, there are only two surviving Raiders: Lt. Col. Richard 'Dick' Cole and Staff Sgt. David Thatcher. 

On April 18, the 73rd anniversary of the raid, the Raiders will present the National Museum of the U.S. Air Force with a Congressional Gold Medal they will be honored with earlier in the week.

The Doolittle Raid, also known as the Tokyo Raid, on 18 April 1942, was an air raid by the United States during World War II.

The raid, led by Lieutenant Colonel James 'Jimmy' Doolittle, caused negligible material damage to Japan, but helped to boost a wounded nation's morale in the aftermath of Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941.

US Army Air Forces B-25B Mitchell medium bombers, with five crewmen on each were launched without fighter escort from an aircraft carrier in the Pacific.

The 16 planes, loaded with one-ton bombs, took off from the aircraft carrier on less than 500 feet of runway. They had only enough fuel to drop their bombs on military targets in Japan and try to land in China with the hope that the Chinese would help them to safety.

Pilots volunteered and trained in Florida for what they only knew was 'extremely hazardous.'

Navigator Griffin, from Green Bay, Wisconsin, got top-secret briefings with pilot David Jones in Washington, just five months after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.

Once at sea, the rest learned targets - factories, plants, military facilities on mainland Japan.

They knew the uncertainties: what if the Navy task force was attacked? What defences would they face? And with B-25s unable to land on a carrier decks, could they reach friendly bases in China?

The Raiders brushed aside Doolittle's assurances that anyone was free to withdraw.

After encountering Japanese patrols, the raid launched ahead of plan, some 200 miles farther from shore for fuel-stretched bombers. Doolittle's plane took off first at 08:20 from a pitching carrier deck.

They flew low in radio silence, skimming seas and then treetops. Cole recalls the country song 'Wabash Cannonball' running through his head. He tapped his foot in time until Doolittle shot him a questioning look.

They were greeted by anti-aircraft guns and puffs of black smoke. Flak shook planes.

When they arrived at the target, Col. Doolittle ordered to open up the bomb bay doors. The bombs dropped, and the raiders 'got the heck out of there.'

The danger was just beginning. All 16 planes lacked enough fuel to reach bases and either crash-landed or ditched in dark, rough weather along China's coast south of Shanghai.

They narrowly stayed ahead of Japanese searchers, who killed villagers suspected of helping the Americans.

Eight Raiders were captured, and three executed. A fourth died in captivity. Three had died off the coast of China.

In the end, fourteen crews, except for one crewman, returned either to the United States or to American forces.  

Bird's eye view: The 16 planes, loaded with one-ton bombs, would fly over military targets in Japan and try to land in China with the hope that the Chinese would help them to safety
