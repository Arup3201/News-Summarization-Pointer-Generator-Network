University of Oregon tight end Pharaoh Brown has been suspended from the Ducks' upcoming bowl game because of his role in leading an on-campus snowball fight that turned on unsuspecting teachers and students, which has been described as 'unacceptable and dangerous'.

A YouTube video of the fight on Friday - which was organized by the UO football team and featured about 100 people - shows players and other students blocking a car before pelting it with dozens of snowballs in front of the Erb Memorial Union in Eugene.

The target, retired professor Sherwin Simmons, was on his way to the campus museum to donate several of his paintings.

Brown is caught on camera dumping a bucket of snow ontop of Simmons, who is attempting to exit to his car to stop the commotion.

Simmons said today he does intend to press charges against Brown or anyone else involved in the fight.

Retired professor Sherwin Simmons says he has no plans press charges over the snowball fight on Friday, which was organized by the Oregon football team

'I decided maybe if I get out, they’ll see that I’m 60 years old and I’m a human being,' Simmons told student paper The Daily Emerald.

'I was blinded by people both tossing snow on the window and racking snow off the roof.

'They were out of control.'

The video has attracted more almost 3.5 million views as of Tuesday afternoon.

Sophomore offensive lineman Andre Yruretagoyena said on Twitter he was 'embarassed' after seeing the clip.

'Embarrassed by the video I just watched. That's not all of us, sending the sincerest apologies,' he wrote.

Brown has since apologized for taking part in the fight.

'I was one of the many UO students involved in the snowball fight on Friday, and my actions escalated to an inappropriate level and, for that, I sincerely apologize,' Brown said in a statement released by the university.

'We never should have engaged innocent people, and I deeply regret my actions and will accept the consequences.'

His suspension was announced Monday by Head Coach Mark Helfrich, who has apologized to the targeted drivers.

Helfrich had promised discipline during the weekend, saying the behavior shown in the video was 'completely unacceptable and dangerous'.

Other players involved in the fight received unspecified punishments but will be allowed to play in the bowl game.

All students involved in the fight, including non-players, are subject to further discipline from the dean of students, the university said.

Brown, a 6-foot-6, 241-pound sophomore, caught 10 passes during the regular season and scored two touchdowns.

Pharaoh Brown will not play in the Alamo Bowl game against Texas later this month due to his role in a snowball fight

He started five of the nine games in which he appeared, getting more playing time after starting tight end Colt Lyerla left the team in October to prepare for an NFL career following a one-game suspension for violating team rules.

He was later arrested for cocaine possession and is awaiting trial after pleading not guilty.

The Ducks (10-2) play Texas (8-4) in the Alamo Bowl on Dec. 30 in San Antonio.
