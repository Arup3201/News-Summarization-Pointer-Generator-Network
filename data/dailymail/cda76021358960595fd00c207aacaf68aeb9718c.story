Thavisha Lakindu Peiris was brutally stabbed to death while delivering pizzas

Two cousins are each facing a life sentence after a pizza delivery driver was brutally stabbed to death - on his last shift before starting a career in IT.

Shamraze Khan, 25, and Kasim Ahmed, 18, killed Domino’s Pizza employee Thavisha Lakindu Peiris after trying to rob his phone last October in Sheffield.

Khan, of Southey Crescent, Southey, was convicted by a jury at Sheffield Crown Court following a two-week trial.

Ahmed, of Ronans Road, Darnall, pleaded guilty to Mr Peiris’ murder on the first day of the trial.

Both men also admitted a robbery they committed earlier on the day of the murder in the Castle Markets area of Sheffield, just hours before trying to steal the IT student’s phone, then murdering him.

The court heard how they struck as Sri Lankan-born Mr Peiris parked his car to deliver his last two pizzas.

A struggle took place as Mr Peiris fought back and he was stabbed several times in the neck, chest, face and arms with one wound penetrating his heart.

The hooded robbers left their victim to bleed to death in the driver’s seat of the Toyota Yaris at around 10.30pm on Southey Crescent on Sunday October 27.

The Sri Lanka-born victim, 25, was studying IT at Sheffield Hallam University and worked for Domino’s to support his education.

He had just successfully applied for a job as an IT consultant in the city and the fatal delivery was supposed to be his last.

CCTV, forensic evidence and the public’s help led police to the killers.

The student had been working at a branch of Domino's Pizza in Sheffield and was delivering an order to an address in Southey. When he failed to deliver the order, his workmates set off to find him

After the hearing superintendent Lisa Ray, who led the investigation, called the murder 'brutal' and 'senseless' before praising the family for the way they supported police efforts.

'Whilst nothing can fill the void or replace the loss of Thavisha, I hope his family can take some comfort knowing that justice has been served,' she added.

His family said in a statement: 'We are still devastated and heartbroken over the loss of Thavisha and we are still unable to comprehend that he is actually gone.

'He gave us so many reasons to smile and was so caring and loving. All we have left are our memories, but they will never fill the void in our hearts. He will never again be with us and we will never hear his voice again.

Grief: Sarath Peiris (left), 66, and Vajira Narangoda Peiris, 59, parents of Thavisha Lakindu Peris, who was stabbed to death during a pizza delivery in Sheffield

'We sent our son to the UK to study so he could have a better life; we never thought he would be in any danger.

'The way in which he was taken from us is absolutely devastating, we cannot understand why anyone would do this to another human being and it fills us with such sadness.

'We were extremely proud of Thavisha’s achievements and we were so happy that he was doing so well in England. He was such a kind and considerate man, always full of life and always with a smile on his face, anyone who met him immediately liked him.

'We would never want another family to go through such a tragic loss and endure the pain that we feel; Thavisha was the centre of our world and we will never get over losing him.'

The killers will be sentenced tomorrow.
