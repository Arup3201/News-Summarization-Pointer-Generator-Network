The Chancellor used this week's Budget to announce the first above-inflation increase in the threshold for the higher rate of tax

George Osborne is expected to pledge to accelerate increases in the 40p income tax threshold if the Conservatives win the general election.

The Chancellor used this week's Budget to announce the first above-inflation increase in the threshold for the higher rate of tax, which has sucked in ever-more middle-class families, in seven years.

But yesterday economists said that even after the latest rise, the decision to limit increases had left millions out of pocket. 

The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said higher-rate taxpayers will be £535 worse off in 2017-18 than they would have been had the threshold risen in line with inflation since 2010.

Those earning up to £100,000 have benefited from repeated increases in the 20p threshold, but not as much as the 26million basic-rate taxpayers.

Mr Osborne persuaded reluctant Liberal Democrat colleagues to agree that the higher-rate tax threshold should rise gradually from £41,865 this year to £43,300 in April 2017 as he sought to woo voters ahead of May's election.

He is now expected to use the Conservative election campaign to say he would go faster if the party wins outright. 

The Chancellor says he wants to deliver a threshold of £50,000 for higher-rate tax and £12,500 for the basic rate. 

The IFS said yesterday that higher-rate taxpayers were feeling the pain from the Coalition's earlier decisions to cut the threshold for paying 40p and then increasing it by less than inflation.

The think-tank said the threshold would need to rise to £48,650 by 2017 to ensure that higher-rate taxpayers had not lost out since 2010.

Robert Joyce, a senior research economist at the IFS, said: 'Higher-rate taxpayers will be £535 worse off because the point at which you start paying 40p income tax has been reduced in real terms significantly over this Parliament.'

But he said basic-rate taxpayers will be £597 a year better off by 2017-18 because of increases in the personal allowance – the point at which income tax of 20 per cent kicks in.

The Coalition has already raised the personal allowance from about £6,500 to £10,000 and it is due to hit £11,000 in 2017.

Mr Osborne said the planned increases in the 40p threshold in the coming years – which could be reversed by an incoming Labour government – were a modest 'downpayment' on Tory plans to raise the threshold to £50,000 by 2020.

David Cameron vowed last year to end the scandal of so-called 'fiscal drag', which has seen millions of people dragged into higher rates of income tax by below-inflation increases to thresholds.

The number of people paying 40p tax has risen from around three million to five million since 2010 and is due to keep rising.

The IFS, the leading independent expert on tax and spending issues in Britain, has estimated that one in four taxpayers could be hit over the coming decade. 

But it has warned that such a large increase in the threshold 'might be politically difficult for a government to go ahead with' given the likely backlash among voters.

The Tories have so far refused to say exactly where the money will come from to fund an increase in the 40p threshold to £50,000 by 2020. The policy has been opposed by Labour and the Lib Dems.

Critics called on all political parties to raise the threshold at which the 40p tax rate kicks in.

One leading tax adviser said the 40p rate of income tax 'was not intended to be a tax on people who you would hardly say are earning a fortune'.
