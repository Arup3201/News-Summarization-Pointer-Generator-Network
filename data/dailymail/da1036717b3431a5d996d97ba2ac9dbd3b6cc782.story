An editor of French Elle has written a book about the 'scandalous' life she led as a celibate woman in today's sex-obsessed society.

Sophie Fontanel, 50, has named her memoir (French: roman) The Art Of Sleeping Alone. It is 'a m√©lange' of things that happened to her, vignettes and semi-autobiographical anecdotes.

The decision simply to not have sex is most refreshing and unusual for someone who does not define themselves as asexual.

In fact, asexual is a word she rejects along with celibacy, chastity and abstinence, opting instead for "singularity".

Sophie Fontanel says the fact that women can make love when and how they want is sexual liberation. But sexual liberation is also to not do it, if you don't want to

'People were saying, "This is insane, 
this account you've written about your life... How is it possible?" They
talked to me as though I were some sort of animal,' says Sophie.

The 50-year-old editor and author experienced a period of prolonged self-imposed celibacy that was 'so easy' to embark on. The book is less about 'why' and more on 'what' and what it means.

However, her singularity ended its 12 year run when she rekindled her sexuality with her partner - a then-married man.

'If you force yourself to make love, 
your sex life isn't as good as the one you dreamt of or expected, if you
don't feel respected, can you just stop? The answer is yes,' she says, speaking with the Sunday Telegraph's Stella magazine.

'The fact that women can make love when 
and how they want is sexual liberation. But sexual liberation is also to
not do it, if you don't want to.'

'What is miraculous about sexuality is that is can die out but it can be rekindled in seconds,' says Sophie, who has never married nor had children.

She admits: 'As I said in the book, there are two things I missed when I stopped having sex.

'One is the loss of self when you make love, you are always in control. The second thing is to be caressed, to be in someone's arms, with your head on his shoulders.'

'If your sex life isn't as good as the one you dreamt of, can you just stop?' philosophises Sophie
