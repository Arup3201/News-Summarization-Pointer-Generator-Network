The watchdog which branded the first privately run NHS hospital as 'inadequate' ignored a large survey showing patients were very happy with the care they received.

A damning report by the Care Quality Commission last week gave Hinchingbrooke Hospital in Cambridgeshire the lowest ever score for standards of care.

The report was particularly scathing of Hinchingbrooke's A&E unit, with inspectors saying that 16 out of the 17 patients they had spoken to were unhappy with their treatment.

But new evidence has emerged showing the watchdog ignored its own much larger survey of nearly 300 patients carried out eight months earlier and published only last month.

This found patients gave it an average score of 8.4 out of ten, rising to nine out of ten for the respect and dignity patients were treated with.

The CQC report and financial pressures led to Circle, the firm running hospital, resigning its contract – to the dismay of patients and staff who fear it may now close, or lose vital departments. But an investigation by the Daily Mail this weekend raised suspicions that the report had been 'stitched-up' by senior Labour and union figures implacably opposed to privatisation.

They included one of the CQC inspectors who is linked to the pressure group Keep Our NHS Public, and another a former member of the doctors' trade union. In addition, a paediatrician believed to have heavily influenced the report is the local Labour parliamentary candidate.

The glowing patients' survey was carried out by the CQC just eight months prior to the inspection as part of a national poll involving nearly 40,000 patients from 140 hospitals in England.

There are now growing calls for an independent inquiry into the CQC's inspection over suspicions that it was unfairly critical.

They are being led by Tory MEP David Campbell Bannerman, who has written to Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt urging him to carry out a review into the watchdog's behaviour.

And since publishing our investigation on Saturday, scores of patients have been in touch with the Mail, relating their own experiences of first-class care at the hospital.

They include one who wrote on our website: 'My father had a knee replacement surgery at this hospital in November and the place is immaculate, his care could not have been better. Honestly, I am stunned that the place is in trouble.'

Another said: 'Had to go to Hinchingbrooke on a couple of occasions and I must say I found the hospital to be one of the best I have been to.'

The hospital, just outside Huntingdon, serves 160,000 patients. Under NHS management, it had been run by the private healthcare firm Circle since 2012. One of its key principles was to give more power to doctors and nurses, rather than middle managers, because they know what patients need.

Since Circle took over, the hospital's waiting times for A&E and treatment have been among the best in the country and patient reviews have been excellent.

The CQC's initial survey of 293 patients treated at Hinchingbrooke's A&E – undertaken by post between January and March last year – gave it an average score of 8.4 out of ten.

This rose to 9.1 for being treated with privacy and 8.7 for whether doctors and nurses properly listened.

Yet when the CQC visited the hospital in September, they claimed patients did not feel 'supported' or 'well-cared for'.

Inspectors said they received 'feedback cards' from 17 patients of which 16 contained 'negative comments' and 12 who said they had not been treated with respect.

This led the CQC to conclude the A&E unit 'requires improvement', while the hospital as a whole was branded 'inadequate' and given the lowest ever rating for patient care.

Mr Campbell Bannerman said: 'I'm really astonished by this report and find it very suspicious. It doesn't stand up.

'The patient feedback has been fantastic, Circle have really turned it around.'

More than 3,000 people have 'liked' a Facebook page set up to show backing for nurses, doctors and other staff at Hinchingbrooke.

And last week dozens of passionate supporters held up 'We love Hinchingbrooke' signs at a public meeting held to discuss the hospital's future.

Meanwhile a group of more than 40 doctors have written an open letter to the BMJ journal pointing out that Hinchingbrooke's very promising statistics do not tally with its 'inadequate' rating.

These include figures showing that 97 per cent of patients would recommend the hospital to friends and family – one of the best scores in the country.

Professor Sir Mike Richards, chief inspector of hospitals at the CQC, said: 'We stand fully behind our assessment that safety, caring and leadership at Hinchingbrooke hospital were inadequate. There is no reason to question the integrity of any member of the inspection team.

'Our findings highlight the significant failings at Hinchingbrooke. They are not a judgment on the role of the private sector in the NHS or on franchise arrangements. Our priority is the care that patients receive. Where hospitals are failing to promote good care, we will say so regardless of who owns and runs them.'

A spokesman for Circle, the private company which has been running services at Hinchingbrooke Hospital, explained in full his company’s reasons for terminating its involvement:  ‘Since the contract was put out to procurement in 2009, the playing field has changed. First, like most hospitals, over the past year we have seen unprecedented A&E attendances at times up to 30% higher, year-on-year - and not enough care places for healthy patients who await discharge.Second, at the same time, our funding has been cut by approximately 10.1% this year. With these pressures on the system, to maintain the standards our patients deserve requires significant further investment, on top of the £4.84 million and considerable resources Circle have invested in the hospital to date.We believe that solving the problems facing Hinchingbrooke can only be achieved through joined-up reform in Cambridgeshire across hospitals, GPs and community services. We fully support the vision of Simon Stevens (NHS England Chief Executive) 5-year Forward View, but these potentially exciting reforms are too far into the future.Finally, we were one of the first hospitals to be inspected under the CQC's new process. We understand their report will be published soon, and fully expect it to be unbalanced and to disagree with many of its conclusions. We are not the only hospital to find their process problematic, and believe that inconsistent and conflicting regulatory regimes compound the challenges for acute hospitals in the current environment.The combination of these factors means we have now reluctantly concluded that in its existing form, Circle's involvement in Hinchingbrooke is unsustainable.’
