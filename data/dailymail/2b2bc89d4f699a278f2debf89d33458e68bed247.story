A bag of clothes found on Sunday belongs to the girl who has been missing in California for almost a week, police said.

Pants and a shirt were found in a Juicy bag, which she carried to school, a few miles from Sierra LaMar's home. Relatives confirmed them as belongings of the 15-year-old. 

Sgt Jose Cardozza of the Santa Clara County Sheriff’s office in California was unable to say whether they were the same clothes Miss LaMar had been wearing when she was last seen leaving for school on Friday morning.

Growing concern: Clothes belonging to Sierra Lamar have been found after the teenager went missing almost a week ago from her home in Morgan Hill, California

Sgt Cardozza told ABC News today that police were treating the girl's disappearance as a missing person’s case.

'There is no information leading us to believe she purposely ran away,' he said.

Family and friends held candlelight vigils for the missing high school student this week.

The new information came to light as the father of 
Sierra Lamar revealed that he is a registered sex 
offender.

However, Steve Lamar said he loves his daughter and had nothing to do with her disappearance last Friday. 

Police
frantically searching for the teen have been questioning her 
classmates and teachers after an examination of her phone, which was 
discovered a mile from her bus stop, gave no new leads.

'I
understand the stigma associated with this in my background, and I 
assure everyone it is not connected in any way to my daughter's 
disappearance,' Steve Lamar said in a statement to the San Fransisco 
Chronicle.

Mystery: Sierra Lamar, 15, disappeared on the walk to her school's bus stop last Friday morning in Morgan Hill, California

According to court records, he was charged in March 2009 with 12 felony counts of committing lewd or lascivious acts with three children younger than 14.

In September 2009, he pleaded guilty to a single charge of committing lewd or lascivious acts with a child younger than 14 and was sentenced to a year in jail, the Chronicle reported.

His daughter was not one of the victims.

Police have said they have spoken with Lamar and he has been fully cooperative throughout the investigation. 

'Please understand, I am a dad, and I want nothing more than to find my missing daughter,' he told the newspaper.

After
conducting a sweep of registered sex offenders in the area, police have
moved on to speaking with Sierra's classmates and searching Sobrato 
High School, where she transferred this year, for clues.

Sex offender: Here is the California sex offender registry entry for Steve Lamar, the father of Sierra

Clues: Her mother snapped this photo of her the morning she disappeared, appearing playful which followed her parents and friends' perception of nothing out of the ordinary

Deputies had suspended their search of the grounds near her home due to a lack of evidence.

'We have exhausted our search efforts in that area. We have investigators 
talking to kids hoping they can lead us in the right direction as far as where 
she could be. We are looking for any information period,' Sgt. Jose Cordoza told ABC News.

A case of a teenage runaway or an abduction, the investigators say they still are not sure.

'I talked to Sierra on the phone Thursday night,' her father Steve LaMar told ABC News saying there was nothing out of the ordinary.

'She was happy, talking to me 
about homework. She was asking me to make an appointment so she could dye her 
hair. She was happy,' he said.

School: On Monday, sheriffs investigators visited Miss Lamar's school of Sobrato High, suspending their ground search for interviews with her classmates and friends

Miss Lamar's mother, Marlene Lamar, who is divorced from her father but said to be equally cooperating with police, confirmed the same view about her daughter.

On Sunday police discovered her cell phone a few miles from her home by its electronic ping. Its charger was found in her bedroom.

Her mother had initially called it when her school reported her as not having attended classes but she found that it was turned off, prompting her to notify police that evening.

Friends: Agreeing with her parents, her friends said that Miss Lamar showed no clues of running away

Without a trace: While police dogs lost her scene at her mother's driveway her cell phone was recovered Sunday in a field nearby

According to reports from the sheriff's 
department her mother is the last one known to have seen her at their 
home she moved into last October.

She took a photo of her daughter on her cell phone before she left last Friday morning, capturing her smiling with her tongue out at the camera. That photo has been submitted to police in help of finding her.

At 6am, Miss Lamar had a half-mile walk to the school bus stop ahead of her, but the bus driver claims to have never seen her, nor fellow students. Police dogs also lost her scent at the driveway of her home.

Evidence: With that field close to this road, pictured, police suspect it may have been tossed there from a passing car

Search: Both the teen's cell phone and laptop are now undergoing forensic studies for any further clues

'We're hoping she's alive and that's 
the most important thing right now,' her mother told KTVU while saying 
she doesn't believe her daughter would have run away.

Her cell phone as well as her laptop are currently undergoing a forensic search.

As both of her high schools circulate her picture, posting and distributing flyers, they hope her friends will have more clues toward her disappearance.

Suspended: The choice to suspend their ground search was decided by a lack of evidence police said

'I hung out with her last week and 
she was happy,' her best friend Channah Foreman told KTVU. 'We 
celebrated my birthday. We don't understand what's going on. It 
doesn't make sense.'

Authorities said there was no indication she planned to run away, unlike in the cases of most fugitive children.

Her sister Danielle claimed that Miss Lamar would never abandon her loved ones, saying: 'She's always in contact with family and friends. She wouldn't leave everyone out of the loop.'

Description: Miss Lamar is 5ft 2inches, slim, with long dark hair and was last seen carrying a black and pink bag made by Juicy

Police previously told the San Jose Mercury News
that Miss Lamar did not appear to have a troubled home life 
and no witnesses have reported anything suspicious from the time or 
location of her disappearance.

Miss Lamar is 5ft 2inches, slim, with long dark hair and was last seen carrying a black and pink bag made by Juicy.

Her father issued an emotional appeal this weekend for her to return, saying: 'Come home, baby, please come home. You're not in trouble. Everyone wants to see you.'

Anyone with information as to the girl's whereabouts was asked to contact the Santa Clara police department on 408-299-2311.
