A PCSO with a photographic memory, who has tracked down 250 suspects after recognising them in the street, has been given an award by police bosses.

Andy Pope has the skills to identify criminals from the tiniest of details - and has arrested 247 wanted suspects in the last two years.

Mr Pope, from Redditch, Worcestershire, was this week given a ‘Putting the Public First Award’ for an unbelievable identification in August 2012.

Memory man: PCSO Andy Pope's photographic memory has tracked down 250 suspects. He memorises their faces at briefings and has seen many out on the beat

The PCSO of eight years even recognised a suspect a whole year after seeing his image, just from a tiny mole on the suspect’s cheek.

The dedicated officer was able to track down the suspected burglar after a dramatic chase through Birmingham city centre, ending with Mr Pope being threatened with a weapon.

In 2012, he identified 180 people, having memorised their images from CCTV still photographs and police briefing meetings.

And this year so far, he has identified a further 67 suspects.

Total recall: Mr Pope spends hours scrutinising mugshots and CCTV to track down suspects

Gift: Mr Pope has the skills to identify crooks from the tiniest of details - and has nabbed 247 wanted suspects in the last two years

Mr Pope has been working on the Safer Travel Team since 2008, and first started identifying people three years ago.

He said: 'I never really thought anything of it at first.

'But three years ago my previous inspector called me in for a meeting and said "look, you’re doing these identifications more than anyone else - you’ve got a gift".

'I always thought it was normal but my boss assured me it wasn’t normal. Some people call it a photographic memory but I just think I’m quite lucky.'

'It’s just a knack for recognising people, which in my line of work I suppose is pretty important.

'Now obviously word’s got around, which can only help keep the streets safer - it’s a good thing for everyone.'

Brave: PCSO recognised a suspect burglar on the streets of Birmingham, chased him down and was threatened with a weapon - but has now been awarded for his efforts

His amazing skills are a result of hundreds of extra hours of hard work before a shift for the modest PCSO.

He said: 'I suppose it’s part hard work and part a natural ability. I do try and work hard at the briefings and remember faces - it’s what everyone does, we’re all pretty dedicated.

'As part of any investigation, CCTV footage and stills are crucial. So the whole force work together to put a face to a name - I guess I’ve just been a bit lucky in recognising people.

'I think due to being on the Safer Travel Team and building up my offender knowledge, that’s where it all started. We cover the whole area as a team so it really helps to remember a face.'

And if Mr Pope is humble about his own work, others are ready to recognise his achievements.

He said: 'I was nominated for the Joyce Campbell award after helping with the arrest last August, I felt so honoured.

'But it’s not about the awards, if I can help people can travel in safety, then that’s enough for me.'
