A model with a rare condition that causes white patches to form on the skin has taken the fashion world by storm after appearing in a New York Fashion Week show.

Winnie Harlow, who suffers from the pigmentation disorder vitiligo, strutted down the catwalk on Thursday afternoon for Spanish fashion label Desigual.

The 20-year-old Canadian, whose real name is Chantelle Brown-Young, was recently named as the face of Desigual's Say Something Nice campaign.

The budding model was chosen for her spirit and attitude and, while announcing her new role as the brand's newest ambassador, Desigual described her as the 'epitome of beauty'.

But that isn't Winnie's only major campaign this season. 

She is also starring in Diesel's spring/summer 2015 ads, which aims to promote 'tolerance, equality and unconditional love'. 

The former America's Next Top Model contestant was diagnosed with vitiligo, the same skin condition that singer Michael Jackson had, when she was only four years old. 

After years of being taunted by her peers for the discoloration of her skin, Winnie first spoke out about her condition in 2011 by posting a video to YouTube.

Last laugh: Winnie, who was once cruelly called 'zebra' and 'cow', is now being celebrated for her distinct look

Ideal spokesperson: Desigual described her as the 'epitome of beauty' in a press release announcing her role as its newest ambassador

'People have black skin, people have brown skin, I have both,' she said in the clip titled titled Vitiligo: A Skin Condition Not a Life Changer

While she was once bullied and cruelly called  'zebra' and 'cow', the fashion industry is now celebrating her distinct look and her positive attitude. 

Earlier today, American Horror Story actress Jamie Brewer made history by being the first model with Down syndrome to walk the runway at New York Fashion Week. 

The 30-year-old starred in Carrie Hammer's fashion show as a part of the designer's Role Models Not Runway Models campaign.
