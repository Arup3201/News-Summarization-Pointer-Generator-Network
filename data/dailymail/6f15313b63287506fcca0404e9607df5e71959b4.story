A fiery crash that killed two high school sweethearts in Louisiana last week has taken an even more sinister twist after a witness came forward to say that the young couple were being chased when their truck slammed into a tree and exploded.

Blake Fritz, 20, and Megan Rogers, 19, were both home from college when they died May 14 in their hometown of Shreveport, Louisiana. Their bodies were so badly burned in the wreck that authorities had trouble identifying who they were.

Now, Paul Leslie has stepped forward with some startling revelations.

Bright futures: Blake Fritz, 20, and Megan Rogers, 19, had been dating since high school. They were both home from college when they died

Horrific: The truck carrying Fritz and Rogers smashed into a tree and burst into flames. Their bodies were charred nearly beyond recognition

Mr Leslie told KSLA-TV that he was awakened by the sound of a revving engine and then the sickening crumple of the truck smashing into a tree.

He ran outside to find a fireball crash.

But he saw something else - two other pickup trucks that had stopped on the street.

The drivers appeared to be talking to each other. Someone got out and took a picture of the fireball wreck.

Then, they drove off, Mr Leslie said.

'I think that somebody was chasing this Blake Fritz. And he got really scared enough to take the risk that he took,' he told KSLA.

Gone too soon: Fritz was a student at the University of Louisiana-Lafayette. Rogers had just finished her freshman year at Louisiana State University

Paul Leslie says he heard the crash and saw the people in two pickup trucks watching the wreckage burn

Police say the truck was traveling at least 50mph when it crashed - twice the posted speed limit for the narrow residential street.

Mr Leslie said Fritz's father told him that his son carried spare gas cans in the bed of his pickup truck. He believes that contributed to the fireball.

Mr Leslie said he has not spoke to the police about what he saw - but he would be willing to.

Fritz was a student at the University of Louisiana-Lafayette. Rogers had just finished her freshman year at Louisiana State University. They had been dating since Rogers was a junior in high school.

'(Megan) never met a soul she didn’t love. She was a wonderful, beautiful Christian girl,' her father Kent Rogers told the Shreveport Times.
