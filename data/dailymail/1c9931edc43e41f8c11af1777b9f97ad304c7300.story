Kristina Pimenova - the controversial nine-year-old Russian model dubbed 'the most beautiful girl in the world'- has a doppelgänger, it has emerged.

Elizabeth Hiley, ten, based in Montreal, Canada, bears more than a striking resemblance to young supermodel Kristina, and her mother now has high hopes that Elizabeth can follow in Kristina's fashion footsteps.

'The likeness between Kristina and my daughter is uncanny,' Anne-Marie Ashcroft, 41, tells Daily Mail Online. 'Before I came across Kristina, I was reluctant to allow Elizabeth to start at such a young age. Now I realize that the time for her is right.'

Comparing Elizabeth to Kristina, who has covered Vogue Bambini and modeled for Roberto Cavalli, Dolce & Gabbana and Armani, Ms Ashcroft says she is optimistic for her daughter's career as a model.

'Logic dictates that Elizabeth could in all likelihood achieve a similar - or dare I say better - standing as a child model,' she theorizes.

Ms Ashcroft first came across Kristina, based in Moscow, after reading about her two months ago on Daily Mail Online.

Kristina's story triggered widespread outrage over her young age, with critics slamming the girl's mother Glikeriya Pimenova for posting scantily-clad images of her daughter to Instagram; many of which garnered sick comments referring to Kristina as a 'babe' and praising her 'long legs.'

Still, it wasn't the  backlash over Kristina's photos that piqued Ms Ashcroft's interest, it was Kristina's astounding likeness to her daughter Elizabeth.

'I was shell-shocked,' she recalls, adding that she immediately sent the article around to friends and family, all of whom responded with observations along the lines of: 'Lovely photos of Elizabeth.'

Ms Ashcroft explains: 'When I clarified that the photos were not of Elizabeth but of another little girl, most were in disbelief.

'And when I showed Elizabeth a picture of Kristina, she asked, “Mommy when did you take that photo of me, I don’t remember that shirt?”'

Ms Ashcroft, who also has a 14-year-old son, David, claims it was on this day that she realized, 'I could no longer come between Elizabeth’s dreams of becoming a model.'

She promptly set up a shoot with photographer Fiona du Jardin, in which Elizabeth copied some of Kristina's poses to demonstrate their 'twin-like' similarities.

Elizabeth was quickly snapped up by two agencies who were sent the photos; Folio, an adults-only agency based in Montreal and Kids London, which will represent Elizabeth in Europe over the school holidays.

Helpfully, Elizabeth is a citizen of both Canada and the UK. 

Folio agent Catherine Marsland, who made an exception when she signed up the agency's only child model, states: 'Elizabeth is an exceptionally beautiful little girl who I believe has great potential in the modeling industry.

'The resemblance between Elizabeth and Kristina is absolutely remarkable and we see a promising future for her.'

Ms Ashcroft is well-aware that many see Kristina as too young and, worse, too sexualized by her mother, but she disagrees with these sentiments.

'I do not believe that many of the accusations made against Kristina’s mother are fair,' she remarks. 'I believe that fundamentally, she has her daughter’s best interests at heart.'

She adds: 'Sadly, we live in a world where we as parents must be vigilant in protecting the safety of our children from those wishing to exploit or seek to harm them.

'As Elizabeth’s Mother, I will seek to find a safe and healthy balance vis-a-vis Elizabeth’s public exposure in her pursuit of a career in modeling.

Ambitions: Elizabeth has been expressing an interest in modelling since the age of eight, but when she grows up, she wants to be an anesthetist doctor 

In the interests of promoting her daughter's extraordinary beauty, Ms Ashcroft has just started a fan page for Elizabeth on Facebook.

'Inevitably, there is a degree of public exposure for child models, actors and the like', she says.

Indeed, a large part of her lookalike Kristina's rising worldwide fame is thanks to her social media presence.

Both her Facebook page - which boasts nearly three million followers - and her Instagram account are manned by Kristina's mother.

Speaking to Daily Mail Online in December in defense of these social media accounts, Mrs Pimenova, 39, said: 

'You must think like a pedophile in order to see something sexual in [Kristina's] pictures, so it is time for you to see a doctor.

'In fact I must say she does not especially like it when I am photographing her, so I do it quickly and when she doesn't notice. I am certain in my mind all her photographs are absolutely innocent.'

Elizabeth, on the other hand, is far from camera-shy and has been expressing an interest in modelling since the age of eight.

'Elizabeth is mature for her age and is a determined girl,' Ms Ashcroft explains. 'I have given careful consideration to my decision to allow her to pursue her dream of becoming a model.'

She adds: 'I do not believe that there is a “magical” age when suddenly this becomes right. I think quite simply that one must look at what’s best for the individual child.'

Porcelain features: Elizabeth (pictured), whose parents divorced in 2013 and whose father lives near London, attends a small private school in Canada

Gifted: The rising star is fluent in both French and English, excels in piano and creative writing, and her mother insists her that her education remains 'paramount'

Elizabeth, whose parents  divorced in 2013 and whose father lives just outside of London, attends a small private school in Canada.

'My daughter is a keen student and her academics are important to her,' Ms Ashcroft says. The rising child star is fluent in both French and English, excels in piano and creative writing, and wants to be an anesthetist doctor one day.

She, just like Kristina, is also a keen dancer.

Having trained in classical ballet from the ages of four to seven, Elizabeth is now a student at 8 Count, Canada’s premier hip-hop dance school, and was recently selected during try-outs for their advanced class.

Asked whether she would allow Elizabeth to leave school early in pursuit of full-time modeling, Ms Ashcroft replies: 'Elizabeth will be encouraged to complete her university, even if on a part-time basis.

'Her education is paramount. I believe that with the right support, Elizabeth can have it all.'

Ms Ashcroft, who is willing to make 'special exceptions' for Elizabeth missing school to take up modeling jobs, is herself clearly an ambitious force to be reckoned with.

'I was forced to abandon my demanding and budding career as a real estate broker at Sutton (formerly with Sotheby's)  to return to being a full-time mother when the children’s father left Canada in early 2012 to live in the UK,' she explains.

Grounded: Ms Ashcroft remarks, 'What I love about Elizabeth is that she always says, “Mommy, looks aren’t everything”. Her heart and mind are in the right place'

Ms Ashcroft's ex-husband is a European sales director for a major American I.T. Corporation, and her family have properties in the U.K., Portugal and Spain.

Elizabeth's mother has since remarried and hopes to soon revisit her own career, either in high-level corporate sales or by starting her own business.

'As a teenager, I thought about becoming a model,' the pretty mother says. 'However, with the exception of a runway stint for a Canadian swimsuit store, it was not something that I pursued.'

As for Elizabeth, who is described by Ms Ashcroft as being 'a kind, caring and sociable little girl', her favorite model is Romeo Beckham, the 12-year-old son of David and Victoria Beckham.

'Elizabeth has the sweetest crush on Romeo Beckham and thinks that he is “very handsome”,' she says.

'That said, what I love about Elizabeth is that she always says, “Mommy, looks aren’t everything”. Her heart and mind are in the right place.'
