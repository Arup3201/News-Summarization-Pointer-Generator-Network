An axe-swinging 'rape and pillage' fighter found in a Viking burial pit had filed his teeth to look more ferocious in battle.

The pain without anaesthetic would have been excruciating - but it would have proved his status as a great warrior, archaeologists said.

The warrior, found in Weymouth, Dorset, had grooves filed into his two front teeth.

Scientists also found other bones and decapitated heads in the pit where a new relief road is being built.

They think the bodies were young 
Viking warriors who were executed without mercy after being captured in a
 fierce battle with the Anglo-Saxons.

During analysis of the remains, the pair of front teeth was found to have distinct incisions.

Lead scientist David Score, of Oxford
 Archaeology, said: 'It's difficult to say how painful the process of 
filing teeth may have been, but it wouldn't have been a pleasant 
experience.

'The incisions have been very carefully made and it is most likely that they were filed by a skilled craftsman.

'The purpose behind filed teeth 
remains unclear but, as we know these men were warriors, it may have 
been to frighten opponents in battle or to show their status as a great 
fighter.'

The burial pit contained 51 skulls and 54 bodies.

Many of the executed men had been 
decapitated and suffered multiple wounds inflicted by a sharp blade, 
including one skeleton with six cut marks to the back of the neck, 
possibly because his captors had tried over and over again to hack off 
his head.

Steve Wallis, an archaeologist at 
Dorset County Council, said radio carbon dating showed the remains come 
from about 970 to 1025.

He said those dates fell within the period of Viking raids and atrocities on the Anglo-Saxons in Britain.

Isotope analysis of teeth found in a severed jaw suggests they were from the Nordic countries.

Mr Wallis said: 'It's great that the 
burial pit is surprising us and teaching us more about who these men may
 have been and what they may have been like.

'It is very rare that this kind of 
deliberate dental modification is found in European remains, although it
 is often found in cultures from around the world, so that it was found 
in an excavation in Dorset is fantastic.'
