One of Britain’s oldest umpires has been forced to retire despite his perfect eyesight and good health because he is no longer covered by insurance.

Charlie Fenton, 92, was disappointed that he had to step down from the Derbyshire and Cheshire Cricket League after more than 61 years umpiring matches.

The spritely pensioner is no longer covered under the league’s insurance which only insures umpires up to the age of 85-years-old.

All out: One of Britain's oldest umpires Charlie Fenton, 92, has been forced to retire from umpiring after more than 61 years in the position

Mr Fenton, from Hyde, Tameside, said: ‘I’m so lucky. I’m so fit, I don’t wear glasses, I don’t wear a hearing aid and I can stand for seven hours. 

‘I’m so happy I’ve had a great career but, of course, I’m disappointed it’s come to an end.

‘I won’t get bored in the summer, though, as I’ve promised to help the boys coming through next season and pass on some of my knowledge.’

Not covered: Mr Fenton is no longer covered under the league's insurance which only insures umpires up to the age of 85-years-old

The great-grandfather’s love of the game began at school when he travelled to Old Trafford to watch Lancashire play.

He said: ‘My mum would pack me off on the train with a bottle of pop and send me to watch Lancashire. 

‘Cricket is a sport which just grows on you.’

His passion for watching cricket was put on hold during World War Two, but by the early 1950s he was spending his weekends umpiring, combining it with his job as a partner in a firm of Manchester estate agents.

He shared his love of cricket with late wife Jessie and their two daughters.

Mr Fenton said: ‘I’ve never missed a single match.

On the pitch: Mr Fenton has enjoyed his umpiring career on the pitch but is disappointed it has come to an end

‘If I was ill, it was between Monday to Friday, I was always better by the weekends. 

‘I can honestly say I’ve never had a cigarette; I’ve always got out and about, so I think that might be why my health has stayed the way it is.’

Next month he will be presented with an award from the league in honour of his long service.

The league’s honorary secretary, Mike Brown, said: ‘We hadn’t realised the age limit on our insurance policy is 85.

‘We said could he carry on if he found his own insurance but that was a non-starter.

'Grows on you': The great-grandfather has loved cricket since he was at school when he travelled to Old Trafford to watch Lancashire play

‘It’s with great sadness that we’ve had to say goodbye to Charlie. 

‘We have our annual dinner on November 9 where we’ll present him with something suitable to mark his many years of service.’

The oldest umpire was Joe Filliston who was still umpiring at 100-years-old. He played for Staffordshire.

Mr Fenton could be the longest-serving umpire. The title officially belongs to Australian Dean Groves who was in the job for 55 years.
