Dwight Yorke slammed Manchester United for their 'lackadaisical' performance in the first half at West Ham United - claiming they were not set up to 'play the United way'.

Fellow Sky Sports pundit Jamie Carragher was equally scathing in his criticism of Louis van Gaal's side, stating that Radamel Falcao and Robin van Persie 'are too similar' to play together.

In a poor first half, Man United created little and lacked any sort of invention, leading to the duo's remarks.

Speaking on Sky Sports, Yorke said: 'I have not seen the ball fizzed around. The movement (up front) is lackadaisical.

'At the other end, (Diafra) Sakho and (Enner) Valencia are moving the United defence around, but they (Man United) are stagnant and this is not the United way.

'We like to see movement and space created for other players to get into. They (Falcao and Van Persie) are easy to play against.'

In addition to Yorke's comments, Carragher was also bemused as to why Van Gaal had opted for the duo of Falcao and Van Persie up front.

The former Liverpool centre back insisted the Man United boss should turn to young striker James Wilson in the second half.

Carragher said: 'I would make a change and bring Wilson on. I am looking at the lack of movement compared to Sakho and Valencia.

'I am not saying these players (Falcao and Van Persie) are bad players, but it is not a partnership.

'I think they are too similar. They are standing still. There is no energy. They have spoken at times about United’s slow play.

'Now, is it down to the passing or is it down to the lack of movement? That is what they have got to change - they have been world-class strikers but as a partnership it is not working.

'When you are almost 30, as those two are, you need a young fella (like Wilson) running around you.'
