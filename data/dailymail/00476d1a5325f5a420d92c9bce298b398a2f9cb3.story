Struggling heading back to work this week? You're not the only one.

On January 5, deemed 'Miserable Monday,' it seems that many newly-back-to-work employees were already dreaming of their next holiday.

Following the long Christmas break, searches for flights and holiday deals on British Airways soared as people returned to work.

Views on British Airways' website jumped by 68 per cent, compared to the first day back at work last year, and reached their peak at 12:30pm - during lunchtime - as customers jumped on the internet to scour airline schedules.

The top searches were to popular destinations in the US, Canada and Asia, with some prices as low as £479 for a trip to Montreal.

Claire Bentley, managing director of British Airways Holidays, said: 'Almost everyone suffers a 'Miserable Monday' being back at work for the first time after being off during Christmas and New Year so inevitably thoughts turn to summer holidays.

'We know lots of people are mulling over places to fly and go on holiday to and have looked at lots of fantasy flights and holidays before they finally commit to a favourite destination and secure their holiday break away.

Deals to European destinations like Barcelona and Rome (pictured) were also of particular interest

'By offering to hold flights with a deposit of just £5 a person, we can give customers time to confirm arrangements with family and friends, making it even easier to book with confidence.

'And with our sale in full fight, we've also got loads of great offers for holiday-makers with prices starting from as little as £129 per person for a two-night break in Rome or Barcelona and a week's holiday in Barbados or Orlando in a three star hotel is available from just £499 per person.'

European destinations were also in more demand this year with searches significantly up for Amsterdam, Berlin, Malta and France.
