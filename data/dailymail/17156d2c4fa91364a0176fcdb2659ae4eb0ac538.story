Lord Ashcroft today stopped the last Dambusters pilot auctioning off his medals to pay for the upkeep of the Bomber Command Memorial by donating £75,000.

Squadron Leader Les Munro, 95, had planned to auction his decorations to pay towards the maintenance of the monument in Green Park, central London.

But he has now accepted Lord Ashcroft’s offer to donate £75,000 to the Royal Air Force Benevolent Fund in return for gifting his decorations and medals to a museum in his native New Zealand.

Donation: Lord Ashcroft has stopped the pilot auctioning off his medals to pay for the memorial's upkeep

Mr Munro, one of only two New Zealanders to have taken part in the 1943 raid, said: ‘I am content that I have achieved my goal of doing all I can to ensure that the men of Bomber Command who lost their lives during the Second World War will be remembered with pride for generations to come.

‘I have been astonished and very touched by the huge interest that the sale of my medals to raise funds for the upkeep of the memorial has aroused.

‘In the end, in consultation with my agents Dix Noonan Webb, I have decided that there was a delicate balance to be achieved between raising funds for the RAF Benevolent Fund and ensuring that my medals are preserved for future generations of New Zealanders to appreciate.

‘Lord Ashcroft’s very generous proposal represents the best way of attaining both these objectives. I am extremely grateful to him.’

Collection: The decorations and medals awarded to Mr Munro, which are: New Zealand Order of Merit, Companion's neck badge (top), then (from left to right) the Distinguished Service Order, New Zealand Queen's Service Order, Distinguished Flying Cross, 1939-45 Star; Air Crew Europe Star with clasp France and Germany, Italy Star; Defence and War Medals 1939-45, New Zealand Service Medal 1939-45, New Zealand 1990 Commemoration Medal

Mr Munro’s original decision to sell his decorations for an estimated £50,000 sparked a row in his native New Zealand, where the government wrongly claimed the medals were protected objects.

The Bomber Command Memorial in Green Park

The Bomber Command Memorial that honours 55,573 airmen killed in the war is maintained by the RAF Benevolant Fund.

A permanent monument was not built for 67 years due to the controversy of thousands of German civilians who died during the bombings of its cities.

The memorial - which features a sculpture of seven bomber aircrew - was eventually unveiled in June 2012 at a dedication attended by the Queen.

A flypast of five Tornados in a ‘V’ formation was provided, and a Lancaster dropped thousands of poppies over Green Park.

But one year later in May 2013 a thug scrawled the word ‘Islam’ on the memorial using red paint - an act that veterans described as 'shocking' and 'appalling'.

Les Munro piloted one of 19 Lancaster bombers on the Second World War raid to bomb a series of dams in the industrial heartland of Germany. The mission resulted in eight of the planes being shot down and 53 crew out of 133 killed.

Despite the losses, the raid was a success with two dams breached by the ingenious bouncing bombs, wiping out scores of armament factories in the Ruhr Valley.

Mr Munro’s Lancaster was struck by an anti-aircraft flak shell on the raid over Holland, knocking a gaping hole in the fuselage and putting all communications out of use, forcing the crew to turn back still carrying its mine.

He was awarded the Distinguished Service Order for the raid and other sorties. Guy Gibson, who led the mission, received the Victoria Cross. 

In 2013 Sqn Ldr Munro visited the monument - which had been unveilved a year earlier - and afterwards said he was inspired to sell his medals in order to pay for a year’s maintenance of the memorial to keep it in pristine condition

But the medals, log books and other associated memorabilia will now be donated to the Museum of Transport and Technology in Auckland.

Lord Ashcroft, who owns the world’s largest collection of Victoria Crosses, said on Twitter: ‘Delighted that last Dambuster pilot Les Munro has accepted my medals offer.’

In addition to the peer’s donation, auction house Dix Noonan Webb has waived its fees and expenses on the understanding that the Auckland museum makes a further donation of £10,000 to the RAF Benevolent Fund.

Christopher Hill, director of client liaison at Dix Noonan Webb, said: ‘We are delighted to have helped Mr Munro realise his aim of raising a substantial amount of money towards the upkeep of the Bomber Command Memorial.

‘We share his belief that the memory of more than 55,000 aircrew who gave their lives should be preserved and we have been in close consultation with him throughout this process.’

Mr Munro's medals include the Distinguished Service Order and Distinguished Flying Cross

As well as his efforts in the Dambusters raid, he also led successful raids to wipe out E-boat and U-boat pens in Le Havre and Boulogne - missions that helped the Allied take control of Normandy and France.

He bombed German aircraft and armament factories, V1, V2 and V3 rocket sites and dropped aluminium strips in the English Channel to trick German radar operators into thinking the D-Day landings were taking place at Calais rather than Normandy. 

Mike Neville, director of fundraising at the RAF Benevolent Fund, added: ‘Lord Ashcroft’s most generous donation, in support of Les’s desire to see his efforts of the Second World War continue to bear fruit today and into the future, is simply terrific.

‘We are very pleased for Les and delighted that he has realised his aim of supporting the RAF Benevolent Fund in their duty of maintaining the Bomber Command Memorial in perpetuity. 

'Les’s sacrifice and Lord Ashcroft’s donation will help ensure the long-term future of the memorial.’ 

Bomber Command suffered huge losses in the war, with 45 out of every 100 airmen killed.
