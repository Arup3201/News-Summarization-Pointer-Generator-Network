UK hackers have attacked an Argentine online video game recreating scenes from the Falklands War and allowing players to shoot British 'terrorists'.

Argentine company Dattatec.com this week launched a 'map' for popular online first-person shooter game Counter Strike pitting Argentine police against the British.

The game's developers said they had repelled a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack coming mostly from computers in the UK.

Fernando Llorente, a spokesman for the Rosario-based company, said: 'Two of our websites were attacked using DDoS during the day, with hackers trying to saturate our server's connexion.

'The attack was 5 Gbps in strength - the equivalent of 5,000 PCs connecting to the sites at the same time every second - but our technical team was able to block it effectively.

'Generally these attacks come from eastern Europe and China, but we detected that most, although not all, of the IP addresses used this time were from the UK.

'At Dattatec we habitually receive different scopes of attack - this is the first one that has come mainly from the UK, although I cannot affirm that it was a case of cyber warfare.

'We think diplomacy should prevail between Argentina and the UK and we do not fear another attack - when someone tries to hit a server and is blocked, they do not try again.'

Stoking tensions: The game features an opening video which reads: 'In 1982, Argentines fought the English to recover the sovereignty of their Malvinas islands' - the Argentine name for the disputed territory

A distributed denial of service (DDoS) is the technical name for cyber attacks that overwhelm computers and make websites disappear.

They are potentially devastating for businesses and their reputations.

The first DDoS attacks occurred in the late 1990s.

They are launched by competitors, extortionists and so-called politically motivated 'hacktivists'.

A cyber attacker floods a network connection with tens of gigabits of traffic.

This creates bottlenecks in firewalls, routers and the connection itself.

Then, when the next request for service tries to come or go, the network connection is clogged and communication stops.

Another scenario sees an attacker flood a target with hundreds of thousands of requests per second, then when the server attempts to process them it shuts down.

Counter Strike features two opposing groups of players, with one side playing police and the other terrorists.

Dattatec's adaptation of the game features an opening video which reads: 'In 1982, Argentines fought the English to recover the sovereignty of their Malvinas islands' - the Argentine name for the disputed territory.

The company said it had left British flags out of the map 'out of respect to the honour and glory of those who fell in the Malvinas'.

Mr Llorente said the game had been downloaded by 15,000 users since it was launched on Monday.

An estimated 650 Argentines, 255 British servicemen and three islanders died in the 1982 conflict.

This month, Falkland Islanders overwhelmingly voted in favour of remaining a British Overseas Territory in a referendum.

But Argentina's foreign minister, Hector Timerman, this week described the vote as 'illegal'.

In May 2011, an add-on was designed for Counter Strike which enabled gamers to recreate an attack on Osama bin Laden's Pakistan compound.

Players were able to act out the role of Navy SEALS as they descend on the terror chief's Abbotabad home.
