A group of friends were refused service at a pub by staff who concerned they were members of the English Defence League because they were wearing shirts with England flags across them.

Peter Kinselley, 52, went to the Hobgoblin Pub, in Bath, Somerset, with eight friends after work to toast to St George's Day.

The group, who were dressed in patriotic garments including England football shirts, white waistcoats with red crosses and St George's top hats were outraged after they were refused service due to their attire.

But a barman told MailOnline the pub has previously had trouble with members of notorious far right EDL on St George's Day and that the group became aggressive when asked if they were members.

Mr Kinselley, from Trowbridge, Wiltshire, said: 'We weren't being abusive - if we were, I could understand the reason why he didn't serve us. 

'We weren't singing or shouting or anything like that - we just wanted a drink. I am not racist in any way myself.'

One of the group added: 'We only went in for a quiet pint after work and got dressed up a bit for St George's Day.

'What's
 wrong with that? Everyone gets green gear on for St Patrick's Day. But 
apparently that made us look like racists. It's ridiculous.'

The English Defence League has been described as the biggest populist street movement in a generation, posing a headache to police and dividing political opinion as to whether it should be banned.

The far-right group emerged in 2009 out of the United Peoples of Luton, formed by Tommy Robinson when Muslim extremists demonstrated in the town against a homecoming parade from Iraq by the Royal Anglian Regiment.

The group has no normal joining procedures or membership list and its activities have been characterised by volatile street demonstrations and ‘flash mobs’. It also has a strong online presence.

The street demonstrations have frequently been associated with violence, anti-social behaviour and arrests, often after clashes with anti-fascist campaigners.

The group's ‘extremist’ image was further enhanced by the news in 2011 that the Norwegian mass murderer Anders Behring Breivik had hailed the EDL as a ‘blessing’ and had written about how he wished to attend EDL rallies.

Just under a third of EDL supporters, or 30 per cent, are educated to university or college level and 15 per cent have a professional qualification, according to the report.

Its supporters are also overwhelmingly male, at 81 per cent compared with 19 per cent female, according to the Demos report.

Mr Kinselley said the group were not 'fanatical' about celebrating the patron saint's day, but that the pub's attitude had made him more determined to mark the occasion.

He added they had encountered no problems in the other pubs they visited, and that they had not been drunk.

The manager of the Hobgoblin, told MailOnline: 'We have a lot of mixed race people coming here, people of different sexual persuasions and we like to keep that environment.

'On previous St George's Days we have 
had some trouble with people from the EDL - they came in dressed 
similarly and chanting racist slogans you know which I don't want in my 
pub. It upsets my clientele.

‘The men came in dressed the same, they were asked if they were members and they got abusive.

‘They shouted a lot, walked out, bashed on the windows.

'I don’t dislike British people, I just hate racism.

'I feel bad that St Georges day has been overtaken by a small majority that use it to promote hatred.'

The manager said that since news of the group being turned away emerged he has been plagued by threatening phone calls.

Across the country members of the controversial EDL have been banned from pubs.

Last year a Hemel Hempstead pub banned group from holding a meeting there.

Protest: Kevin Carroll, former EDL deputy leader, addresses supporters of the far-right English Defence League in May following the killing of Lee Rigby. Mr Carroll also quit the group last year

The previous year a Norwich pub also banned members of the far-right group which emerged in 2009 from meeting there as well.

In
 September Selfridges came under fire for giving an EDL leader and his 
friend a free lunch worth £83 after a sales assistant refused to serve 
them.

Tommy Robinson was at the high-end store on London's Oxford Street accompanying a friend who wanted to buy a pair of jeans when a member of staff allegedly told his friend 'F*** off, I'm not serving you.'

The sales assistant is said to have sworn at Robinson's friend after querying whether he was with the leader of the far-right group.

When Robinson, 30, and his friend complained to management, they were given a free £83 lunch at the store's in-house Hix Restaurant, Champagne and Caviar Bar.
