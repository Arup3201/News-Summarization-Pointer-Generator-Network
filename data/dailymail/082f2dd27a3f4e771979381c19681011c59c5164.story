Pharrell Williams - who just scooped two awards at the 2015 Grammy Awards - turned up to the Los Angeles event  with his androgynous wife Helen Lasichanh on his arm.

The 41-year Happy crooner was head-to-toe in his own fashion collaboration, Adidas Originals, as he rocked a white shorts-suit - sans the statement hat he wore at the 2014 Grammys - and went sockless with a pair of matching  brogues.

Model Helen, 35, - who often coordinates her gentleman-inspired outfits with her husband's - towered over him in a gray form-fitting Adidas jumpsuit, which she wore with pared-down black stilettos.

E! host Ryan Seacrest declared Pharrell's athletic attire as 'shin show', to which Pharrell replied: 'I usually wear shorts. That's just like my thing.'

Indeed, the rapper - who had six Grammy nominations and won Best Solo Performance and Best Music Video for his hit song Happy tonight - donned Lanvin shorts at last year's Oscars, where he and his wife matched once again in monochrome tuxes.

According to Pharrell, this year's Adidas suit is actually gray, but is crafted with a 3M-made fabric that enables it to turn white in photos.

One thing noticeably absent, much to the disappointment of countless Twitter commentators, was the infamous Vivienne Westwood hat he wore to last year's Grammys.

Said hat became such an online sensation that it even yielded its own Twitter account, and was later bought by American food chain Arby's due to the likeness of its logo.

Arby's paid over $44,000 for the honor of owning Pharrell's hat, to benefit his charity From One Hand to AnOTHER.

Much like her hit-maker husband, Helen possess a distinctive style aesthetic. She rarely strays from pant suits, but she did marry Pharrell in a dress in 2013 - albeit a daring tartan number.

Asked to describe her approach to dressing by The New York Post last year, Helen nonchalantly responded: 'I don’t choose, it’s just who I am.'

While Helen always attends high-profile events with Pharrell, she consistently keeps a low profile, and almost never smiles.

And it's no surprise the duo often look so samey in their red carpet get-ups.

'She just reminded me so much of myself,' Pharrell once told Oprah about what first drew him to her. 'Different, and marches to the beat of her own drum.'

The couple had their son Rocket in 2008.
