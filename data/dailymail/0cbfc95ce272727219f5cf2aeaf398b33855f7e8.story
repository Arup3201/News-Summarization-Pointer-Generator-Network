If you are watching your weight, you should perhaps seek help from the professionals.

A study has found that slimmers who attended Weight Watchers lost just over 10lb on average – enough to drop a dress size.

In contrast, those who went it alone were only a mere 1lb or so lighter six months later.

It is thought that dieters benefit from regular contact with others with the same goal.  Plus, the thought that the next weekly meeting – which includes a weigh in – may help them avoid giving into temptation. 

Slimmers who attended Weight Watchers lost on average just over 10lb in six months, a study has found

Paying to attend classes may also boost motivation. In contrast, those who devise their own diet may lose interest, especially if their weight loss is not as rapid as they would like.

They may also give up because the their eating plan may be too restrictive or difficult to follow long-term.  In the study, almost 300 men and women were split into two groups.

One group attended Weight Watchers meetings for six months.  The others were given leaflets and other information but left to come up with their own weight loss plan.

Those in the slimming club were eight times more likely to shed five per cent of their flab – an amount judged to make an impact on health.

In contrast, those who went it alone were only a mere 1lb or so lighter six months later

Those who attended the most meetings did the best.   However, access to an internet program and mobile phone app also helped, the American Journal of Medicine reports.

Researcher Craig Johnson, of Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas, said: ‘The people who were most engaged were the people who did best.’ 

Karen Miller-Kovach, of Weight Watchers, which funded the study, said that that the slimming group can provide ‘proven, effective, affordable and convenient treatment’ to tackle the public health challenge posed by obesity.

The study is far from the first to conclude that Weight Watchers works and the NHS already regularly pays for people to attend classes.

The weekly sessions begin with the infamous ‘weigh-in’, in which members step on to the scales in a private corner of the room to discover if their efforts have been successful.

They then learn about healthy eating including the points-based system which scores food according to their protein, carbohydrate, fat and fibre content.

But some experts say that it is the group dynamic that is important – and other slimming groups work just as well.

Dr Ian Campbell, a GP and medical director of charity Weight Concern, said: ‘The real secret of weight loss is getting deeper than just calories in and calories out and looking at what causes us to do the things we do and the choices we make.

‘And certainly doing it for longer than the six months cited in this study.’
