The Union Flag could be banished from packets of British meat under rules proposed by the EU.

The diktat would also apply to logos and flags representing Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.

Any such move would infuriate retailers and farmers. It would also annoy shoppers keen to support British farms, where animal welfare standards are now among the highest in the world.

Restrictions: Packaged meat products on sale in high street chains such as Sainsbury's (pictured) will no longer be allowed to have a Union flag on their labels

The European Commission has drawn up proposals for a standardised fresh meat labelling regime for all 28 member states.

The
 plans are intended to help consumers understand the origins of what 
they are eating because of concerns that labels are misleading.

But
 officials at Britain’s food and farming department, Defra, claim the 
current draft scheme could have serious unintended consequences.

While
 a pack would have to carry a UK reference to identify where the animal 
was reared and a second to state the country of slaughter, all other 
symbols would be banned.

This
 would stop the use of the Union Flag, the Scottish Saltire, the dragon 
of Wales and the Red Tractor logo, which is designed to identify British
 farmed food.

The new 
restrictions would apply to all fresh meat other than beef. Beef 
labelling has its own set of rules, set up in the wake of the BSE 
scandal. Defra is writing to suppliers and retailers asking for 
responses to take back to Brussels to try to get the proposals changed.

Lindsay
 Harris, the department’s deputy director of food and material security 
and standards, told The Grocer magazine: ‘The draft proposals revealed 
this week suggest other voluntary information such as symbols like a 
flag would not be allowed at all.

'Crazy': Industry experts say the planned restrictions on packaged products, including pork (file picture), would cause chaos on the high street.

‘There
 are many examples where descriptions other than the member state are 
used, such as a flag. I imagine this will be a major concern to a number
 of states.’ He stressed that the proposals were not set in stone, and 
added that other countries were also likely to demand the right to 
continue using national flags and other symbols.

The British Retail Consortium said national flags were useful for shoppers.

Its
 deputy director of food policy, Andrea Martinez-Inchausti, said: 
‘Surely it is a good thing for products such as British pork chops to 
flag up their country of origin with something like a Union Jack. It’s 
not something to be vilified.’

She
 also believes that putting the country of slaughter as well as origin 
on the label is unnecessary, and could create confusion and extra red 
tape. 

Country of origin 
labelling is supported by British farmers. At present, imported meat can
 be labelled as British if it undergoes processing in this country.

In
 the past this has meant that pies, sausages and other products made 
here with meat imported from abroad could be labelled as made in 
Britain. Eventually, the EU proposals may be extended to stop this scam.
 But farmers are concerned that the plan to ban national symbols is a 
step too far.

Deborah 
Cawood, of the National Farmers’ Union, said: ‘We know that consumers 
want to be certain where their food comes from. It is critical that 
labelling spells out where the animals involved are born and reared.

‘British
 food is recognised for its quality and production standards. UK farmers
 follow some of the most stringent standards in the world. It is 
important that their products are easily identified in the market 
place.’

The European Commission insisted that the information provided by Britain’s food and farming department, DEFRA, and the British Retail Consortium about the threat to the use of national flags and logos was wrong.

A spokesman confirmed that the EC is drawing up new compulsory rules to standardise the labels on pre-packaged meat to provide information on the country of origin. This will be combined with a new regime for voluntary labels that will allow the use of flags and logos.

‘The Commission has no intention of banning flags and other logos on pre-packaged meat,’ he said.
