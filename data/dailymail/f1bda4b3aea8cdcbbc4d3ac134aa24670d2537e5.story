A rare bottle of Scottish single malt whisky is expected to fetch an incredible £150,000 at auction.

The 'extraordinary' bottle of Bowmore 1957, will be the main lot at Bonhams’ Whisky Sale in Edinburgh on Wednesday.

One of only 12 bottles, the 54-year-old single malt is the oldest the distillery has ever released and the oldest whisky ever to come from the Isle of Islay.

Stiff drink: This 'extraordinary' bottle of 54-year-old Scotch whisky is expected to fetch £150,000 at auction

The auctioneers believe it will sell for between £100,000 and £150,000.

A spokesman for Bonhams said: 'It is, of course, also the rarest and is expected to become a highly sought after collectors’ item.

'The whisky itself is said to carry initial flavours of blueberries, cassis, figs, sea salt and eucalyptus followed by dark chocolate and grapefruit leaving the drinker with an aftertaste of bergamot and star anise.'

Mine's a double: A second bottle of the same rare malt will be sold at Bonhams' whisky auction in New York on October 28

The whisky is being sold to benefit 
five Scottish charities - Alzheimer Scotland; The Beatson (West of 
Scotland Cancer Centre); CHAS (children’s hospice services); Erskine 
(medical care for Armed Forces); and Marie Curie (cancer care and 
research).

A second bottle of the Bowmore 1957 will be sold at Bonhams’ whisky auction in New York on October 28.

The proceeds will once again be donated to the same five Scottish charities.
