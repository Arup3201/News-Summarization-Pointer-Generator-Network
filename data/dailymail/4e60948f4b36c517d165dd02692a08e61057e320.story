Having a chart topping app in the Apple Store is the holy-grail for every tech-developer.

Topping the rankings means the app is on display to millions of people around the world who browse the store, making it an enormously lucrative and sought after feat.

But an image which has gone viral this week suggests some designers are willing to stretch the rules in order to climb the charts, reports Shanghaiist.

The photo shows a Chinese employee sitting in front of about 100 iPhones and apparently manipulating app store rankings 

The photo, uploaded to social media site Weibo, shows a Chinese employee sitting in front of about 100 iPhones with the accompanying caption: 'Hardworking App Store ranking manipulation employee'.

In theory, workers can  download the app to boost its ranking, delete it, and then download the app a second time for the same result.

Numerous tech websites have featured the image, including Tencent Technology, who reported the image offers a glance into the elusive app-ranking manipulation industry.

Tencent estimated that a hundred forged ratings can be created within an hour or two, though it's unclear how much of an influence this has on the App Store rankings.

A second image purports to show the costs for breaking into the charts and keeping apps on given charts for a week

A second image spreading like wildfire purports to show the cost for breaking into the top 10 apps- about $AU14300 - and for keeping it there for the week- about $84,402.

Apple has reportedly taken a number of routes to crackdown on those trying to manipulate the ratings, including lowering the price the price of apps in hopes that will inspire more users to rate the app.

But if the image is legitimate, and worlersare simulating real users, it could prove challenging to clampdown on the industry.
