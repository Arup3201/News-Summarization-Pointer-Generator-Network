Neil and Sonia Musselwhite trusted Gino DiCaprio (pictured), whom they had known for 20 years, when he told them he could fulfill their dreams of having a child

A serial crook jailed for stealing £12,000 from a deaf couple who thought he was helping them have children via a surrogate mother in Kenya has been ordered to pay them almost £30,000.

Gino Di Caprio, 53, of Rossendale, Lancashire, was ordered to pay more than £14,000 each to Sonia and Neil Musselwhite over the scam which began in June 2011.

He must also pay Mr Musselwhite's mother the same amount after conning her and her son out of almost £90,000 by persuading them to invest in bogus property deals in Kenya in a separate scam.

Di Caprio told the Musselwhites, who were unable to conceive, that he could arrange for them to have the baby they longed for through his contacts in Kenya.

He went with the couple to a fertility clinic in Oxford and pretended to arrange for their eggs and sperm to be sent to the African country, charging them £34 for the carriage.

He then took a fee of £6,000 from them for the fabricated surrogacy, before spinning a lie that the child had Down’s Syndrome.

He said that the child's condition meant that they would be unable to take it, because of their own disabilities and would also lose their money.

A deal for a second baby was reached but DiCaprio extracted more money by saying the child was ill and that there had been visa complications to delay its arrival.

He even sent them fake pictures of the baby, called Amy, which he had actually taken from a photographer’s website. 

Mrs Musselwhite gave up her job in February 2013 to prepare for the child's arrival. 

Police later discovered this was a picture of Di Caprio's own daughter, called Ellie.

After being arrested in September last year, he was jailed for three and a half years in March for four counts of confidence fraud.

The scams were said to have left Mr and Mrs Musselwhite emotionally and financially devastated.

A hearing to confiscate his assets was due to be held at Reading Crown Court on Friday last week, but did not go ahead because an agreement was made in advance over the amount of money Di Caprio had available to pay back his victims.

Di Caprio - who is also deaf - had known Mr and Mrs Musselwhite for almost 20 years and they regarded him as a friend.

Mr Musselwhite said DiCaprio attended the Oxford fertility clinic, where he appeared to speak with the receptionist, leading them to believe that eggs and sperm held at the clinic were going to be sent to Kenya

Oscar Del Fabro, prosecuting, told the court on Friday that Di Caprio would have £44,230.59 available to pay back his victims, and that would be split three ways between them.

Rebecca Randall, defending, asked for the maximum time to pay because of Di Caprio’s difficulties as a deaf man making the arrangements from prison.

Di Caprio was given six months to realise his assets and pay up, with a sentence of 15 months’ imprisonment if he fails to do so within the deadline.

During his trial in March, the court heard that he had 11 previous convictions for numerous offences dating back to 1982, including theft, forgery and making false statements. 

He was jailed for eight years in 1992 for robbing a jeweller while armed and for two years in 1999 for attempting to obtain property by deception.
