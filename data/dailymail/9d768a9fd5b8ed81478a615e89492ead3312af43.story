Families could see the cost of food, children’s clothes and other essentials rise by £800 a year under European Commission proposals for a radical shake-up in VAT.

The warning has been triggered by a Commission white paper on the future of VAT and efforts to harmonise the sales tax across Europe.

The Coalition government raised the VAT rate to 20 per cent in January. However there is an exemption for food, children’s clothes, tap water, passenger travel, books, newspapers and some other products.

The UK also has a lower rate of 5 per cent on domestic energy bills in a bid to help struggling families.

The
Commission, which is supported by the UK’s respected Institute for 
Fiscal Studies(IFS), argues that exemptions should be abandoned in order
to create a common VAT regime, cut business costs and improve the 
functioning of the European single market.

Such
a move, which could raise £24billion a year for British government 
coffers, would be a hammer blow to the country’s poorest families and 
pensioners.

However, Brussels and the IFS argue that most – but not all - of the money could be given back through measures including a cut in the standard rate of VAT, lower income tax and increases in benefits.

Richard Asquith, the head of VAT at the international business services company, TMF Group, sounded the alarm over the Commission plans.

He pointed to proposals buried in the Commission white paper - ‘Towards a simpler, more robust and efficient VAT system tailored to the single market’.

Significantly, the paper argues for a 
shift towards a simplified VAT regime with exemptions reduced to a 
minimum in a bid to reduce bureaucracy and boost economic growth.

It
states: ‘The fragmentation of the common EU VAT system into 27 national
VAT systems is the main obstacle to efficient intra-EU trade and thus 
prevents citizens from reaping the benefits of a genuine single market.

‘To simply stay in the comfort zone of ‘business as usual’ will not be enough.

‘Responding to these challenges demands a more ambitious reform of the current VAT system.’

Mr Asquith 
said: ‘The EC is also looking to eliminate many reduced VAT rate 
exemptions in an attempt to impose a harmonised fiscal regime across all
27 member states, and help countries consolidate their financial 
position in the face of the current Euro crisis.

‘For
the UK, this means its cherished zero VAT rating of food and other 
goods, such as books and newspapers, could be lost.  ‘Instead, it would 
be forced to raise the VAT rates on household food spend to the standard
VAT rate to 20per cent.’

The
latest Office of National Statistics’ Family Spending report shows that
the average household weekly expenditure on food and non-alcoholic 
drink averages £53.20 a week.

If VAT was added to this figure at 20per cent, this would cost households £553 per year.

Raising VAT on energy from 5per cent to 20per cent could be another £180, while abolishing other exemptions on tap water, train and bus tickets, books and newspapers could be at least another £100.

In theory, Britain has the right to set its own VAT rates. However, it will come under increasing pressure from the other 26 member states and organisations like the IFS to abolish the current exemptions.

While the UK does not charge VAT on food, the sales tax is applied at 20per cent in Belgium, 19.6per cent in France, 19per cent in Germany, and 13per cent in Spain.

Mr Asquith said: ‘Currently, the UK is the only country in the EU that does not levy the full VAT charge on all foodstuffs.

‘The rationale behind this exemption is that the less well off, who spend a larger proportion of their incomes on food, would be disproportionably hit.’ 

The Commission argues that if VAT was applied at the full rate to more products, it would be possible to reduce the standard level.

The white paper concludes: ‘Introducing a broader tax base, as well as implementing the principle of taxation at the standard rate, would generate more revenue at less cost, or alternatively allow the standard rate to be reduced in a revenue-neutral way.’

There is no figure on what the new UK rate might be. It might be possible to apply VAT at 15per cent, rather than the current 20per cent.

However, even under this scenario, the cost of essentials, such as food, heat, and clothes for children would rise sharply.

The IFS was involved in the background research used to draw up the Commission proposals and it argues against the UK’s VAT exemptions.

It believes poorer families can be protected against extending the sales tax to food, children’s clothes and other produced by changing the tax and benefits regime.

Senior research economist at the IFS, David Phillips, said: ‘Exemptions, in particular, are anathema to the whole principle of VAT.

‘As part of our study for the EU Commission we examined the welfare consequences of abolishing zero and reduced rates of VAT.

‘We found that because of less distortion to household’s spending decisions, removing all zero and reduced rates and using the revenue to reduce the main rate would lead to welfare gains amongst the winners that exceed the welfare losses of the losers to the tune of £1.1 billion in the UK.

‘Whilst such a reform would, on its own, be regressive, changes to direct taxes, tax credits, and benefits could be used to address this concern, redistributing the gains from winning households to the poorer losing households.’

These could include an increase of £1,000 in income tax allowances, so taking 1.5million people out of paying the tax; a 2p cut in the basic rate of tax, and 1.5p cut in the higher rate of tax.

There would also be a 3.4per cent increase in other tax allowances, tax thresholds, tax credits and benefits.

The IFS said: ‘Spending the proceeds in this way offsets the regressive impact of broadening the VAT base.’
