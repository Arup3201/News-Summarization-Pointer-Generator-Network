David Cameron today warned Muslim leaders they had 'a problem' if they objected to being asked to do more to tackle Islamist extremism.

The Prime Minister said letters sent to mosques were 'reasonable, sensible and moderate' and ministers were 'absolutely right' to insist everybody had a responsibility to fight radicalisation.

It came after the Muslim Council of Britain accused the Government of 'ratcheting-up tensions' and adopting the language of the far-right.

David Cameron, speaking  in Ipswich, Suffolk, this morning, insisted Muslim leaders they had 'a problem' if they objected to the Government's demand for them to do more to tackle Islamist extremism

More than 1,100 imams and Islamic leaders have been sent a Government letter urging them to show 'men of hate' that they have 'no place' in Britain's mosques 'or any place of worship'.

In the letter, Communities Secretary Eric Pickles and minister Lord Ahmad write: 'We must show our young people, who may be targeted, that extremists have nothing to offer them.

'We must show them that there are other ways to express disagreement – that their right to do so is dependent on the very freedoms that extremists seek to destroy.'

The letter ends: 'We welcome your thoughts, ideas and initiatives on how to ensure that Islam's true message of peace triumphs over those who seek to divide our communities.'

But some Muslims have expressed anger at the ministers' challenge to  show how Islam can be part of British identity.

After the letter emerged this morning, the Muslim Council of Britain said it wanted Mr Pickles to clarify his request and asked if, like 'members of the far right', he was suggesting that Islam is inherently apart from British society.

Deputy secretary-general Harun Khan said: 'We will be writing to Mr Eric Pickles to ask that he clarifies his request to Muslims to 'explain and demonstrate how faith in Islam can be part of British identity'.

'Is Mr Pickles seriously suggesting, as do members of the far right, that Muslims and Islam are inherently apart from British society?' 

The letter was sent by Communities Secretary Eric Pickles and minister Lord Tariq Ahmad of Wimbledon

Muslim commentator Mohammed Ansar went further, tweeting: 'Ridiculous and unhelpful intervention from the Communities Secretary, Eric Pickles this morning, by asking all Muslims to prove themselves.

'Government ministers, rather than ratcheting-up tensions and fuelling the fifth column narrative, should be looking to unite communities.'

But asked about the criticism this morning, Mr Cameron insisted the letter was ‘reasonable, sensible and moderate’ and suggested that anyone opposing it ‘really has a problem’.

Answering questions after a speech in Ipswich, the Prime Minister said: ‘I think it is absolutely right to write this letter, to say that we all have a responsibility to fight extremism.

‘Anyone who reads this letter - and I've read the letter - will see that what he is saying is that British Muslims make a great contribution to our country, that what is happening in terms of extremist terror has nothing to do with the true religion of Islam.

‘It's being perverted by a minority who have been radicalised. But everyone needs to help with dealing with this problem of radicalisation.

‘Anyone, frankly, reading this letter, who has a problem with it, I think really has a problem. I think it is the most reasonable, sensible, moderate letter that Eric could possibly have written.

‘Frankly, all of us have a responsibility to try to confront this radicalisation and make sure that we stop young people being drawn into this poisonous fanatical death cult that a very small minority of people have created.’

Finsbury Park Mosque in north London has attempted to tackle the extremists which once worshipped there

The letter was published after Mr Pickles and Home Secretary Theresa May held up signs reading 'I am Jewish' during a Board of Deputies of British Jews meeting yesterday

Mr Cameron's intervention came after Lord Ahmad had earlier rejected the criticism and insisted the letter was clear.

He told Radio 4's Today programme: 'Within the letter there is an explicit paragraph that says British values are Muslim values. You can't be more explicit than that.'

He added: 'Perhaps he wasn't clear in what the letter said but if you have seen a copy of the letter ... it has been pretty explicit that we want to work together with the Muslim community.

'This was about reassurance, it was about recognising, as Theresa May said only yesterday, that a Britain without Muslims, a Britain without Jews, Hindus, would not be the Britain we want to see.' 

The letter slams far-right groups like the English Defence League (pictured), but some Muslims say ministers appear to use the same language as such groups by suggesting British and Muslim identity is distinct

Mr Pickles has previously written to Muslim leaders to offer support after arson attacks on mosques by far-right groups, but the latest letter is the first time he has challenged them to tackle extremism. 

The letter emerged the day after the Metropolitan Police announced it is reviewing how to keep its officers safe amid fears of a terror plot to kidnap or kill a policeman or woman.

Home Secretary Theresa May also promised to increase the Government's efforts to tackle the terrorist threat and a 'chilling' rise in anti-Semitism.

Assalamu Alaikum,

We have recently seen terrible atrocities committed in Paris. Finding the right response to these events is a challenge for everyone. The hijacking of a great faith to justify such heinous crimes sickens us all. As Muslims around the world have made clear, such actions are an affront to Islam.

And yet, amid the carnage, came a sign of hope – over three million people of all backgrounds, marching to defeat the gunmen and to protect our values: free speech, the rule of law, and democracy.

We are proud of the reaction of British communities to this attack. Muslims from across the country have spoken out to say: not in our name.

But there is more work to do. We must show our young people, who may be targeted, that extremists have nothing to offer them. We must show them that there are other ways to express disagreement: that their right to do so is dependent on the very freedoms that extremists seek to destroy. We must show them the multitude of statements of condemnation from British Muslims; show them these men of hate have no place in our mosques or any place of worship, and that they do not speak for Muslims in Britain or anywhere in the world.

Let us assure you that the Government will do all we can to defeat the voices of division, but ultimately the challenges of integration and radicalisation cannot be solved from Whitehall alone. Strong community-based leadership at a local level is needed.

You, as faith leaders, are in a unique position in our society. You have a precious opportunity, and an important responsibility: in explaining and demonstrating how faith in Islam can be part of British identity. We believe together we have an opportunity to demonstrate the true nature of British Islam today. There is a need to lay out more clearly than ever before what being a British Muslim means today: proud of your faith and proud of your country. We know that acts of extremism are not representative of Islam; but we need to show what is.

British values are Muslim values. Like all faiths, Islam and its message of peace and unity makes our country a better and stronger place, and Britain would be diminished without its strong Muslim communities. Every day, mosques and other faith institutions across the country are providing help for those in need, and acting as a centre for our communities. It is these positive contributions that are the true messages of faith and it is these contributions that need to be promoted.

We would also like to reassure you that in recent days we have met with police chiefs to make sure they are providing the support that mosques need, a concern that some of you have expressed in our recent discussions. We have also met with the Anti-Muslim Hatred Working Group to hear their concerns about responses to the recent attacks and what more can be done.

Anyone experiencing violence should report it to the police online on the True Vision website or to TELL MAMA, a service to provide support specifically to Muslim victims of hatred. The vitriol espoused by the thugs of the English Defence League and Britain First is just as much an affront to British values as the teachings of preachers of hate.

For organisations experiencing problems with such preachers, information about free legal advice is available from LawWorks at www.lawworks.org.uk/community-groups or the Bar Pro Bono Unit at www.barprobono.org.uk, and the Charity Commission has published a toolkit for charity leaders to help protect their organisations from abuse by extremists.

We welcome your thoughts, ideas and initiatives on how to ensure that Islam's true message of peace triumphs over those who seek to divide our communities.

Thank you for all the positive work you are doing, and we look forward to working with you further. We continue to appreciate all your insights.
