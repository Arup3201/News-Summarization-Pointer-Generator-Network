Louis van Gaal may well have looked at the central defenders on show at The Hawthorns on Monday evening and concluded the most reassuring wore No 6 for West Brom.

With Manchester United shaky at the back, and exploring the possibility of taking Ron Vlaar from Aston Villa in January, Joleon Lescott stood out as an option who would have cost nothing last summer. 

Crossing the Manchester divide is a trip few have made, but you imagine such tribalism fails to concern Van Gaal. Lescott  showed he still has plenty to offer at 32. 

Joleon Lescott intercepts the ball from Robin van Persie as West Brom earn a draw with Manchester United

The former Everton and Manchester City defender moved to The Hawthorns on a free transfer in the summer

Discarded by Manchester City, he brought calm and authority to the Albion backline. Twice early on he read the play wisely to intercept dangerous balls from Angel di Maria, alleviating the pressure on his team.

Nothing spectacular, but when measured against the nervous actions of United’s defenders, £16million Marcos Rojo in particular, it becomes something more.

Louis van Gaal may feel he missed out after seeking defensive reinforcements ahead of the season

Lescott was out-muscled by Belgian Marouane Fellaini for United's first equaliser

Van Gaal’s defenders have the crying out for an organiser since Nemanja Vidic and Rio Ferdinand departed. Lescott was vocal  too, moving his team-mates into position when required. 

His performance was far from faultless. He misjudged one ball to allow Robin van Persie a chance and was out-muscled for the goal by Marouane Fellaini. 

But given what Van Gaal has to work with, he could be forgiven for admiring enviously nonetheless.
