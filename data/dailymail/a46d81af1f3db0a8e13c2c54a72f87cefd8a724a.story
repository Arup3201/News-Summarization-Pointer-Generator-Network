This enormous rubber duck is far more than a bathtime buddy.

Dubbed Spreading Joy Around The World, it was designed by Dutch artist Florentijn Hofman to 'put a smile' on people's faces.

The 54ft-high inflatable made its first appearance today in Hong Kong, where it will be spending a month floating around the city's Victoria Harbour.

It has already visited famous waters around the world, including the cities of Sydney, Osaka and Auckland. Its next location is a well-kept secret, but it is believed to be an undisclosed city in the United States.

The duck is deflated for transportation and then reinflated on location using a generator.

The artist claims the duck reconnects people with their childhood

Mr Hofman said he wanted to bring joy with his giant duck, which he claimed help reconnect people with their forgotten childhoods.

'My sculptures cause an uproar, astonishment and put a smile on your face,' he said.

'They give people a break from their daily routines. Passers-by stop in front of them and enter into conversation with other spectators. People are making contact with each other again.'

In a statement on his website, he said: 'The Rubber Duck knows no frontiers, it doesn't discriminate people and doesn't have a political connotation.

'The friendly, floating Rubber Duck has healing properties: it can relieve mondial tensions as well as define them. The rubber duck is soft, friendly and suitable for all ages!'

The artist's other works include Fat Monkey - a giant monkey made from 10,000 brightly-coloured flip-flops - and a giant cuddly toy rabbit called Big Yellow Rabbit.

The rubber duck has already visited 10 countries and 12 cities around the world
