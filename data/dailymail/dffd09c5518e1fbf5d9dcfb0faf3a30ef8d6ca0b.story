Italian top flight side Parma expect to be deducted points for financial instability after failing to meet deadlines to pay overdue wages.

In a statement on Tuesday, the Serie A club said 'unfortunately, we will have to deal with a certain points penalisation that the club will try to reduce to a minimum in every available level of appeal.'

Parma explains in the statement that owner Tommaso Ghirardi has been in negotiations to sell the club and a preliminary deal was agreed 'of which an essential element was to complete the purchase no later than November 10, so as to guarantee outstanding payments by November 15.'

That deal has been 'unexpectedly' delayed.

Parma are bottom of Serie A, having lost nine of its 11 matches.
