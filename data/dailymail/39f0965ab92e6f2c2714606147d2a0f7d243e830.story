Dundee United have rejected an increased offer from Hull of Â£2milllion plus add-ons for Scotland left-back Andrew Robertson.

West Ham United have also had three offers rejected.

The 20-year-old rose to prominence after signing for United from League Two amateurs Queens Park before going on to make his full Scotland debut against Poland in March.

Rising star: The Dundee United player was voted PFA Young Player of the Year last season

Meanwhile, Hull midfielder Robert Koren, 33, is poised to join up with Frank Lampard and David Villa at Melbourne City.

Lampard and Villa will both join the A League side on short-term loan deals after signing for new MLS side New York City.

Veteran winger Damien Duff is already at Melbourne having been released by Fulham at the end of last season, and Koren, who made 26 appearances for the Tigers last season, could also opt to see out his career in Australia.
