An Illinois Army National Guard soldier vowed to bring 'the flames of war' to America if he was unable  to join ISIS in Syria, while his cousin bragged about gunning down 150 people at a military base disguised in his uniform, federal prosecutors said Thursday.

Hasan R. Edmonds, the 22-year-old guardsman, was arrested Wednesday evening at Chicago Midway International Airport trying to board a plane on the first leg of a journey to Egypt. 

Jonas M. Edmonds, 29, was detained a few hours later his home in Aurora, the U.S. attorney's office in Chicago said.

A federal complaint says the plan was for Jonas to carry out an attack at military installation in Illinois after Hasan  left for the Middle East.

The pair allegedly visited the base on Tuesday with an undercover FBI agent they met on Facebook to discus their plans. They believed he was an accomplice.

The alleged plan the pair devised was for Hasan (right) to flee the country and join ISIL while Jonas (left) would have snuck into a base where he trained, disguised in his uniform 

According to federal documents, Hasan described the rooms inside and talked about which ones should be hit. 

They are suspected of plotting an armed attack against a U.S. military facility in northern Illinois where Hasan  had trained. The complaint did not name the facility.

A spokesman for the Illinois National Guard, Lt. Col. Brad Leighton, said Hasan was member of Golf Company 634th Brigade Support Battalion, based in Joliet.

In Facebook messages to an undercover FBI agent in January, Hasan  said that if he was unable to make it to the Middle East, he would help bring 'the flames of war to the heart' of America and 'cause as much damage and mayhem as possible,' the complaint says. 

In other social media messages, Hasan said his knowledge of the U.S. military and American psychology would prove helpful in terrorizing Americans, prosecutors contend.

'If we can break their spirits, we will win,' he said, according to the complaint.

He allegedly spoke admiringly of the terrorist attack in Paris on the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo.

'Honestly, we would love to do something like the brother in Paris did,' he allegedly wrote.

Both men face a count of conspiring to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization, the Islamic State. The conspiracy includes their alleged terrorist plots in the U.S. A conviction carries a maximum 15-year prison sentence.

They made initial appearances in a courtroom in Chicago later Thursday. Jonas  kept swiveling in his chair, stroking his beard and, at one point, yawned loudly. Hasan  sat still.

Hasan's sister, Manchinique Bates, told the Chicago Sun-Times, 'They aren't terrorists. ... Just because they choose to worship as Muslims does not make them terrorists.'

Jonas  allegedly communicated to an undercover agent that it may be difficult for him to get travel documents. This may have been because he has a previous conviction for conspiracy to commit armed robbery in Georgia.

Therefore, he said he would stage attacks in the U.S. using AK-47s to kill up to 150 people, prosecutors allege.

If he couldn't secure guns, he said he would use anything he could get his hands on, the complaint says.

'I can unleash a lion,' he says. 'What I would need ... honestly nothing. I am prepared to go even if it's with a rock.'

Illinois Gov. Bruce Rauner said Thursday he was briefed about the investigation Wednesday. He provided no further details.

Hasan wasn't on active duty, so any criminal allegation will be addressed by civilian federal authorities, said Leighton, the Illinois National Guard spokesman.

Leighton said Hasan Edmonds reported to the Joliet base one weekend a month and that he did two weeks of active duty training — typically in the summer. Hasan Edmonds enlisted in 2011, but had never deployed. 

He worked as a supply specialist that was part of a logistics unit providing supplies and other services to the 33rd Infantry Brigade Combat Team, Leighton said.
