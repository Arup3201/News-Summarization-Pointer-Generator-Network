Even by Hollywood standards Keira Knightley has experienced intense scrutiny over her body.

Her slim frame became a defining point as she started to walk red carpets and appear in shoots as a young media star.

And now the 29-year-old actress has spoken out about the constant manipulation of her body in photoshoots and claimed that it shouldn't matter what women look like.

Keira Knightley, currently on the campaign trail for her latest film The Imitation Game in which she stars with Benedict Cumberbatch, has spoken out about the manipulation of her body in photoshoots

Speaking to The Times about a recent topless shoot for Interview magazine the actress said: 'I’ve had my body manipulated so many different times for so many different reasons, whether it’s paparazzi photographers or for film posters.'

Referencing the fact that the dramatic shoot, appearing in the September issue of the magazine, displayed her small chest Keira says it was her intention to make a statement that her body shape or size doesn't matter.

'That [shoot] was one of the ones where I said: "OK, I’m fine doing the topless shot so long as you don’t make them any bigger or retouch." Because it does feel important to say it really doesn’t matter what shape you are.' 

The actress, who married musician James Righton last year, says: 'I think women’s bodies are a battleground and photography is partly to blame.'

Turning philosophical the actress, who married musician James Righton last year, says: 'I think women’s bodies are a battleground and photography is partly to blame. Our society is so photographic now, it becomes more difficult to see all of those different varieties of shape.'

The quotes reinforce a wariness of Hollywood and celebrity life that has come through in several of Keira's recent interviews.

The British beauty has been uncharacteristically candid as she promotes her latest film, speaking out on issues such as gender inequality within the acting industry.

 'The people who make movies, whether it's directors or producers, or money people, look for things that they can identify with and if they're all predominantly middle-aged white men, then what you see are things that middle-aged white men can identify with. And you don't get anything for anybody else,' she told net-a-porter's The Edit this month.

The 29-year-old's undeniably slim frame has meant constant scrutiny since she first appeared on the screen

In 2008 promotional posters for King Arthur in 2004  featured a Keira as a rather buxom pirate girl, and leaked images showed that her chest had been created with a bit of Hollywood fakery.

Keira said: 'They painted my t**s on me for the films, which is extraordinary because it's kind of a dying art form - in the past, they used to have whole sections of the studios devoted to bosom make-up.

'And I loved it, completely loved it. Because it was the first time in my life I had big t**s, and I didn't even need surgery.'

Although the star, who now leads a relatively normal life out of the public eye in north London with her husband, also claimed earlier this year that despite not regretting her own decision to go into acting she would be '150 million trillion percent' discouraging of any future daughter going into the business, citing the cruel jibes as a reason to avoid the industry.
