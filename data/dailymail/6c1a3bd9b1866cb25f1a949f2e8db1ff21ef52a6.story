Police are 37 times more likely to stop and search a black person than a white person, latest research has shown.

Human rights group, The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC), investigated what are known as section 60 stops, where officers detain people without suspecting them of being involved in any particular crime.

The researchers discovered that while overall use of the power had fallen, excessive use against ethnic minorities had continued or in some instances increased.

Three quarters of all Section 60 stops were carried out by the Metropolitan police, a total of 258,000 between 2008 and 2011.

The next highest was Merseyside Police where officers conducted 40,940 Section 60s in the same time period. Some forces barely used the power at all.

According to the EHRC, between 2008 and 2009, Met officers stopped 68 of every 1,000 black people in their area.

Although this fell by more than half between 2010 and 2011 to 32.8 per 1,000, in the rest of England the figure was just 1.2 per 1,000. 

However the highest rates of racial disproportionality were outside London with an officer in the West Midlands 28 times more likely to search a black person than a white person.

Overall black people were found to be 37 times more likely to be stopped under Section 60 that white people.

Asian people were 10 times more likely to be stopped.

The effectiveness of the searches has also been called in to question as it was revealed that between 2008 and 2009 only 2.8 per cent of Section 60 searches resulted in an arrest falling to just 2.4 per cent between 2010 and 2011. 

In most cases police officers are required to have what is referred to as 'reasonable suspicion' that someone is involved in a crime before conducting a search.

However the Section 60 power, which is part of the 1994 Public Order Act introduced as a response to the rise in illegal raves, gives an officer the power to stop and search a person simply because they might fear violence or disorder.

Response: A spokesman for the Met defended its use of Section 60 searches saying: 'These powers are critical in our efforts to tackle knife, gun and gang crimes'

A spokesman for EHRC told the Guardian newspaper: 'Black youths are still being disproportionally targetted and without a clear explanation as to why, many in the community will see this as racial profiling.

'Moreover, police data itself questions the effectiveness of this practise. Some forces are using 200 or 300 stops before arresting an individual over a weapon.'

A spokesman for the Met defended its use of Section 60 searches saying: 'These powers are critical in our efforts to tackle knife, gun and gang crimes.'
