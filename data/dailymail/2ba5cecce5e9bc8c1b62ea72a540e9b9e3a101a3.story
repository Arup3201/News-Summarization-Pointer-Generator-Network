Football legend Stanley Matthews's 1953 FA Cup winners' medal could fetch up to £60,000 when it goes under the hammer next month - almost three times more than the price its TV presenter owner paid in 2001.

The medal - won by Matthews in the FA Cup final which now bears his name - was bought by television personality Nick Hancock for £23,500 at Sotheby's 13 years ago.

The Queen presented Matthews with the winners' medal after his stand-out performance brought his Blackpool side back from 3-1 down to take a 4-3 victory against Bolton Wanderers.

The win meant the winger finally got his hands on the trophy after losing two FA Cup finals in 1948 and 1951.

The 'Matthews Final' went down in history as one of the greatest matches at the old Wembley, featuring one of the England international's most memorable performances.

In 2001, a year after Matthews, who also had two spells at Stoke City, died, his medal was sold at auction to They Think It's All Over presenter Mr Hancock.

Speaking to the Telegraph in 2010, Stoke City fan Mr Hancock said owning the medal brought him joy, despite the fact Matthews was not playing for his team when he won it.

He said: 'I am a massive Stoke City fan and a lover of sporting memorabilia. So it made perfect sense to buy Sir Stanley Matthews's FA Cup-winning medal from 1953 as he was the club's greatest ever player.

Nick Hancock, a keen collector of football memorabilia, is selling the medal, which could fetch up to £60,000

'It cost me about £20,000 and was money well spent as it brings a lot of joy. I don't actually have it but have given it to Stoke City to put on display at the stadium. 

'I have also bought one of Gordon Banks' England caps for £5,000, although I've never worn it.'

The medal is to be resold by Mr Hancock through sports memorabilia specialists Graham Budd on November 11. 

At the same sale, Ray Wilson's England 1966 World Cup winners' medal, sold at Christie's in 2002, is expected to sell for up to £120,000.

The medal, which was awarded after England's 1966 win against West Germany, is inscribed with the words: 'FIFA. World Championship Winners, Jules Rimet Cup, Ray Wilson, In England, 1966.' 

It is the second time the medal has been put up for sale. It was previously sold for £80,750 in 2002. 

The 1953 FA Cup Final, known as the Matthews Final, has gone down in history because of the brilliant performance by the winger - and because of his two previous FA Cup final defeats.

Matthews's Blackpool side were down 1-0 to Bolton Wanderers within two minutes, with Nat Lofthouse the first on the scoresheet for Bolton.

Blackpool and England forward Stan Mortensen was able to score an equaliser, but with 22 minutes to go until full-time, Matthews's side were 3-1 down.

In one of the greatest individual displays seen at the old Wembley, Matthews miraculously inspired Blackpool to victory.

Mortensen got a second, but, with one minute of time left on the clock, they were still losing 3-2.

Mortensen then scored a third from a free kick - making him the only player to score a hat-trick in a Wembley FA Cup final.

Minutes later, Matthews put a cross into the penalty box, which Bill Perry hammered home to win the trophy.

Even though he did not score, the match became known as the Matthews Final. Blackpool's all-time record apperance maker Jimmy Armfield explained why.

He said: ‘The nation just loved him. He had suffered in previous finals and they just wanted him to win.

‘I don’t think we have ever had a player like him before or since. He was unique. He played from the age of 15 until nearly 50. Amazing.'
