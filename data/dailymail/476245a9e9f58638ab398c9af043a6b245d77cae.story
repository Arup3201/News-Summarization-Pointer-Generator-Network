Renowned: Federico Garcia Lorca, pictured, was among tens of thousands of civilians killed by militias loyal to the late General Francisco Franco in 1936

Archaeologists will start inspecting land in southern Spain where radical poet Federico Garcia Lorca is believed to have been executed and buried  in 1936.

Lorca, one of Spain's most renowned 20th-century poets, was among tens of thousands of civilians killed by militias loyal to late dictator General Francisco Franco at the start of the Spanish Civil War.

The search for his grave remains one of the greatest mysteries of the 1936-1939 war, which was started when Franco rose up against Spain's elected leftist Republican government. 

Experts will begin this latest bid to uncover his remains by sounding a roughly 3,200 sq. ft of hillside close to the southern city of Granada.

The process involves using radar to send pulses through the soil - with echos reflecting back any significant change in soil condition.  

Initial work in the area, which begins 17 November, will not involve any digging, according to officials. 

They added that it will be up to a court to decide on the next step if signs of bones are detected. 

Luis Naranjo, an official with the southern regional government of Andalusia, said that the project is aimed at discovering the remains of Civil War victims, not specifically those of Lorca. 

Lorca is best known for tragedies such as 'Blood Wedding' and his poetry collections 'Poet in New York and 'Gypsy Ballads.' 

His work draws on universal themes like love, death, passion, cruelty and injustice. 

An earlier high-profile dig for his grave, which took place over two months in 2009, yielded no results. 

At the time, the poet's family initially opposed the dig, saying that they preferred to let the remains lie in peace. Relatives also argued that Lorca should not be singled out for recognition when so many families were also seeking to recover missing loved ones. 

They later said they might be prepared to offer DNA samples to help with identification if bones were found.

Federico García Lorca, one of Spain's most renowned poets and dramatists was born June 5, 1898, in Fuente Vaqueros, a small town a few miles from Granada.

He later moved to Madrid, where he joined a radical group of students and became close friends with the artist Salvador Dali, with whom it is thought he had a turbulent love affair, and Luis Luis Buñuel, the film director.

In 1930, after a brief stint in New York City, Lorca returned to Spain, which had been declared a republic. 

The following year he began touring nationally with his own theatre group, La Barraca, for the Republic's Ministry of Education. 

He is best known for tragedies such as 'Blood Wedding' and his poetry collections 'Poet in New York and 'Gypsy Ballads.' 

By 1936, when Lorca was 38, he was a highly visible figure with known Republican sympathies. 

On 16 August that year, García Lorca was staying at Callejones de García, his country home, at the outbreak of the Civil War.

He was arrested by Franquist soldiers and taken into custody. Two days later, they took Lorca  to the grave of his brother-in-law, Manuel Fernandez Montesinos - the Socialist ex-mayor of Granada whom the soldiers had murdered and dragged through the streets.

There Lorca was murdered, along with two bullfighters and a schoolteacher.

His books were burned in Granada’s Plaza del Carmen and were soon banned from Franco’s Spain.
