The husband of a New Jersey State Assemblywoman tried to get a charitable organization that helps low-income homeowners to build them a luxury home on the Jersey Shore.

Richard Stender, the husband of Assemblywoman Linda Stender, got Coastal Habitat for Humanity to assist him with demolishing their $465,000 home in Manasquan after it was damaged during Hurricane Sandy. 

After getting the non-profit to assist with the demolition of the single-story home, Mr Stender tried to get it replaced with a two-story house that would have been almost three times as large.

This was what the Stender's home in Manasquan looked like before it was damaged during Hurricane Sandy 

Mr Stender filed zoning plans for the new 2,000-square foot house with Manasquan's construction office, NJ.com reported. 

The demolished home was only 700 square feet.

The plans for the 'Stender residence' show four bedrooms, three-and-a-half bathrooms, an eat-in kitchen, a two-car garage and a wood-burning fireplace.

Mr Stender also wanted Habitat for Humanity to put a screened porch on each floor and build an outdoor shower with a 'louvered ceiling.'

Coastal Habitat for Humanity executive director Maureen Mulligan noticed the excessive plans. 

She said: 'When the plans were presented to Coastal Habitat and I saw them, I immediately said "No."

 'This was not the type of house that Habitat builds, which is a three-bedroom one-and-a-half bath, 1,200-square-foot house.' 

NJ.com reports that Stender may not even live at the beach house. When she registered to run for reelection in 2013, she used an address in Scotch Plains, New Jersey.

At the time, Assemblywoman Stender told a friend she lives with her mother and her husband lives in Manasquan.

She has not commented about the plans her husband submitted, but she did confirm that her family asked for Habitat for Humanity's help. 

Assemblywoman Stender said: 'Like many others, our family suffered significant losses as a result of Hurricane Sandy.

'An application was made to Coastal Habitat for Humanity to assist in rebuilding. 

'There are outstanding issues which are the subject of continued efforts to resolve.' 

No home has been built on the now-vacant site. 

'The first several hundred years of settlers in Manasquan were devoted mostly to agriculture and fishing for their main economic base,' according to a New Jersey Shore website.

'In the 1800’s, investors saw the opportunity to market Manasquan as a resort town for people eager to get out of New York and Philadelphia on hot summer days. 

'Today Manasquan remains one of the top New Jersey Shore getaways. 

Thousands flock to the beach each summer by day – and many more come to Manasquan in the evening to enjoy the fine restaurants and nightlife.'
