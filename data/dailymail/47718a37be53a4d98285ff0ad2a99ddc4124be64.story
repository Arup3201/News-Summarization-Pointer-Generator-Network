Conservative Australian Senator Jacqui Lambie has been told to 'get a life' after she echoed a controversial government senator's call for the burqa to be banned.

The Tasmanian former soldier told SBS she completely agreed with Senator Cory Bernardi's opposition to the full-length garb worn by some Islamic women.

The fiery Palmer United Party senator posted a meme on Thursday night featuring a woman wearing a burqa and holding a gun which said 'for security reasons it's now time to ban the burqa'.

'Ban the burqa': Senator Lambie shared this post on her public Facebook page on Thursday night

The broadcaster quoted Ms Lambie saying: 'I agree whole-heartedly with Senator Cory Bernadi’s comments - and call for an immediate and complete ban on the wearing of burqas in public. 

'People can do want the want in the privacy of their own homes – but for the public safety of our children and families – remove the burqa.'

Controversial words: Tasmanian senator Jacqui Lambie. 

Spray: Senator Lambie last week said people who believe in sharia law should 'get out' of Australia.

Prominent Islamic community spokesman Keysar Trad told Daily Mail Australia Ms Lambie was 'jumping on the phobia bandwagon'.

'I think she should get out more,' Mr Trad said. 'She really seems to me like a misinformed person and should learn a bit more about her fellow Australians.'  

After the largest counter-terrorism operation in the country's history on Thursday, South Australian Liberal Senator Bernardi tweeted: 'Note burqa wearers in some of the houses raided this morning? This shroud of oppression and flag of fundamentalism is not right in Aust'. 

Prime Minister Tony Abbott, who himself has said in the past he found the burqa 'confronting', distanced himself from Mr Bernardi's remarks. 

'We shouldn't fret about people's faith. We shouldn't fret about what people wear. We should guard against crime. We should protect ourselves against potential terror,' he told reporters. 

Opposition Leader Bill Shorten was scathing about Mr Bernardi's burqa comments. 

'Why on earth is this out-of-touch, out-of-line Senator on a rampage with his ignorant and stupid comments?' he said at a press conference in Canberra.

Last week, Senator Lambie told reporters that people who support sharia law should 'get out' of Australia.

A spokesman for Senator Lambie was unavailable for comment on Friday morning.
