Jailed: Jason Novak met the woman last year as they were investigating her fiancee, Christopher L. Branham, above

A sheriff’s deputy may have overstepped his bounds with a key informant in a drug case after the two allegedly had a brief sexual affair while he investigated her fiancé.

Then-Detective Jason Novak of the McHenry County Sheriff’s Office in Illinois was reportedly suspended and relegated back to the patrol division in the case.

Novak met the woman last year as they were conducting their investigation of Christopher L. Branham, who was suspected of selling illegal narcotics and prescription drugs.

The Northwest Herald reported that after their initial meeting in March 2011, Novak kept in contact with the woman, mostly with his cell phone.

The allegations are being brought by Branham’s attorney in a bid to have evidence thrown out in his drug case, arguing that Novak took advantage of her.

Branham was arrested on April 28, 2011, after his fiancé signed a ‘permission to search’ form at the couple's home.

During that search, cops said that they had found a slew of drugs, including morphine, Oxycontin and meth, according to the Herald. 

In court documents obtained by the Herald, Branham’s attorney Hal Stinespring said: 'Novak persisted in his interaction with Fiance, much of which became personal and not relevant to the issue of potential contraband in Branham’s home.

'Some of Novak's contact with Fiance was sexual in nature and relayed over phone calls or text messages on his department-issued cell phone.'

The court documents allege that the fiancée took a page from the Monica Lewinsky scandal when she wore a blue dress as she travelled to Novak’s house, where she allegedly performed a sex act on him, the evidence of which remains on the dress.

Policing the police: An internal investigation has been conducted by the McHenry County Sheriff's Office on Novak, but the results of that probe have been sealed

Novak has not commented on the case.

An internal investigation has been conducted on him, but the results of that probe have been sealed.

Assistant State’s Attorney Michael Combs argued that the Stinespring has no right to those files, telling the Herald: 'This is a fishing expedition and the defense is seeking information in the detective’s personnel file.'
