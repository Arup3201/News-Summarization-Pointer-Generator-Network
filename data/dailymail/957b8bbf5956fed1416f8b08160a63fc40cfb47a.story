A bus driver is being investigated by his bosses after he was apparently caught on film urinating on his vehicle.

The film, which was shot by a passerby, appears to show the driver zipping up his flies after relieving himself out of a gap between the central doors of his empty bus.

Johnson Rotimi, 24, captured the moment through the window of the Arriva bus parked in Crouch End, London.

Mr Rotimi said: 'I just happened to walk by and I saw him doing his thing.

'He actually hadn’t left the bus at the time.

'You know the second doors? He was actually peeing in the corner with his back facing towards me, through the little gap between the doors and the bus.

'When I saw him I was kind of shocked to be honest, then I quickly got my phone and started filming it.

'He was quite angry when he realised. He did give me a bit of a middle finger.'

The moustached driver is understood to have been taking a break to check his bus - the W3 from Finsley Park to Northumberland Park - when he stopped to urinate in Elmfield Avenue.

Trainee forklift driver Johnson, of Hornsley, London, added: 'I just want people to be aware of what is going on on the bus.

'Angry': The passerby said the bus driver was 'quite angry' when he realised he was being filmed

'I’m not very pleased about it. It is not nice as lots of elderly people and children they have to use the bus, and you know kids, they touch everything, and they could touch that bit when they climb on and off the bus easily.'

Bosses at Arriva said they were looking into the incident which happened around two weeks ago.

An Arriva spokesman said: 'This is not the sort of behaviour we expect from our drivers. A copy of the video will be passed to the management team in order to identify the driver and take the necessary action.'
