His wife had come over from Pakistan just seven months ago and according to neighbours he had appeared happier since with her.

'We've known him for many years and he's a real nice guy. That's really surprising to find out something like that,' a neighbour who wished to not be named told FOX40.

Family of Nasim say they believe it's all a big misunderstanding while police say he asked for his wife to be killed 'immediately' in exchange for money.

Nasim who Fox40 reports as running a convenience store nearby while having an engineering degree from UC Davis is being held without bail.

His family is said to be well known in the area, owning several homes and gas stations.
