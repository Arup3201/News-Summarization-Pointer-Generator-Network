New sex education packs produced by Family Planning Association warn girls not to send 'sexy and pouting' photos using their phones (file picture)

Children as young as nine could be taught in school about the dangers of sexting.

New sex education packs produced by a charity warn girls not to send ‘sexy and pouting’ pictures using their mobile phones.

They suggest telling children of seven not to email photos of themselves in  swimming costumes in case they fall into the hands of paedophiles.

The lesson plans have been compiled by the Family Planning Association, which said they are necessary in the light of the Operation Yewtree police investigation into historical sex abuse claims.

Other lessons focus on cyberbullying and the dangers of giving away personal information or talking to strangers online.

But family campaigners said the packs – titled Growing up with Yasmine and Tom – risk breeding ‘unhealthy distrust’.

In an activity for seven to nine-year-olds, pupils are told Yasmine wants to send photos to her aunt in Australia. They are shown five pictures and asked to say which are ‘OK to send and which are not OK’.

Teachers are advised a photo of Yasmine in swimwear is ‘not OK’ as ‘some people like looking at pictures of children in their underwear/swimwear/naked’. Pupils should ‘think about where photos posted online can be seen’.

In a second activity, for nine to 11-year-olds, pupils are told Yasmine takes a ‘sexy and pouting’ photo on a phone and posts it online. It is seen by a male friend.

She ‘realises how far the photo has spread and looks horrified’. The lessons are part of a pack, launched last week, that schools can download for £299 a year.

Norman Wells, director of the Family Education Trust, said it was ‘symptomatic of a mindset that thinks young children should take responsibility for their own safety, when in reality it is the job of parents to protect them’.

He added: ‘To address such issues in the classroom runs the risk of introducing ideas and thoughts that many children are not ready for. In some cases [it] is likely to breed an unhealthy distrust and suspicion of adults.’

The FPA is among groups campaigning for compulsory sex education in primary schools.

Currently,
 primaries teach reproduction as part of the science curriculum, and the
 Government recommends they also teach sex education tailored to pupils’
 age.

The Government has resisted calls for compulsory primary sex education.

Audrey Simpson, of the FPA, said she hoped to sell the packs to a ‘significant percentage’ of Britain’s 22,000 primary schools.

She said the need for the resource was ‘a sign of the times’, adding: ‘Look at what’s happening with the whole Yewtree thing.

Children need to be aware… It’s about treading a fine line between raising awareness but not frightening children.’

Dr Simpson insisted it was not intended to remove parental responsibility, but to involve parents and encourage pupils to seek permission before sending pictures.

The lesson plans were tested on a panel of teachers including Sarah Beach, deputy head of a primary in Northamptonshire, who told the FPA it was a ‘great starting point for discussions’ and would help new teachers to tackle difficult issues.
