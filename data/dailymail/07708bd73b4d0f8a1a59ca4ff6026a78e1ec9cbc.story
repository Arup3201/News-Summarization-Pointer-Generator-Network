Online abusers have set up Facebook hate pages attacking TV news anchor Reham Khan and her family after it was rumoured that she had married Pakistani politician Imran Khan.

News of the potential union sparked outrage in Pakistan and trolls have now accused Ms Khan of being a lesbian for stroking a woman's back, and attempted to shame her for going to parties.

Users have blasted her for wearing short skirts, slated her for dancing with unknown men in public, and branded her daughter a 'pornstar' while claiming to be in possession of topless pictures.

One image even claims to show Ms Khan in a sex shop in the UK wearing a pink nightdress, with a collar around her neck and a whip slung over her shoulder.

Backlash: Hate groups have already sprung up on Facebook where users have been sharing photos of her dancing and going out with friends while making abusive comments

Among the images posted by online abusers was this photograph, which they claim shows Ms Khan in a sex shop, wearing a night dress, suspenders, a collar and with a whip over her shoulder

Anger: The suggestion that Imran Khan could be about to marry Reham Khan, a divorced mother-of-three who used to work at the BBC, has caused outrage in conservative Pakistan 

Mr Khan has today said rumours of marriage were 'greatly exaggerated', while his sister Aleema said the family challenged him 'a few days ago' over the news and he denied it.

Aleema branded the reports lies, saying they had been concocted by Mr Khan's political enemies to damage his reputation.  

She told MailOnline: ‘This is the only way the opposition know how to attack him. These are the tactics they would stoop to. It’s out of control. I guess that is politics.

‘I spoke to my brother a few days ago and he said it isn’t true. 

'We, the family, just asked him outright, have you married her? And he said no. I don’t know if they are in a relationship, here [in Pakistan] you are either getting married or you are not.

‘We’d be extremely happy if he marries a good person and settles down, of course we would. But it is not just his consideration, it’s a consideration for the country, it’s like a national-level decision. 

Online trolls have attacked Ms Khan for her appearance, dancing with unknown men, and attending parties

'There are people in Pakistan who love him so much that everyone wants to participate in his private life, they feel he is their leader and should be part of his decision.

‘Everybody [we, the family] are taken aback at how much other people want to participate in this decision.’

Asked if her brother is in a secret relationship with the TV broadcaster, she said: ‘It’s a confusing signal to everyone who follows him [but] we asked him if he was married and he said no. I don’t know if he is in a relationship. We just asked him if he was married.’

Khan has since tweeted his followers, saying rumors of his marriage are 'greatly exaggerated'.

Aleema also appeared in a YouTube video several months ago, alongside Imran's nephew, in which she again said the family had spoken to him about marriage, and he told her it was 'not the right time'.

However sources close to both Reham and Imran have suggested they are in a relationship - but that Imran has now distanced himself from her amid political recriminations. 

A former staffer at the TV station where Reham is now an anchor said the pair used to meet any hour of the day or night without restrictions,

A producer at the station said Reham had 'very good access' to Imran, while his political party knew about the meetings and never tried to stop them.

A family friend of Reham Khan, who wished not to be named said: ‘She had an affair some time back but it finished very quickly. 

'Later, we learned that she was very serious with Imran Khan and there was news that Imran felt the same. 

'But, I think after realising that he would be trapped in another problem, Imran has now put some distance between them.’ 

The online trolls have attempted to shame Ms Khan for wearing short skirts on TV and appearing to have wrinkles in some shots

Imran's ex-wife Jemima Goldsmith revealed in October that she was ditching the surname ‘Khan’ and reverting to her family name because her ex-husband was about to remarry.

She said at the time: ‘My ex-husband, Imran, recently announced that he intended to get remarried soon, which made me think it’s probably time to change my name back to Goldsmith.’ 

Another well-known news anchor in Pakistan, Farhat Javed Rabani, Tweeted on December 27: ‘Ahmmm... an anchor has married a politician today... ‪#WeddingBells’  

Leading political commentator Dr Shahid Masood, who is a close friend of Imran Khan, said on television that Imran neither confirmed nor denied the news.

He added that members of Imran’s political party, Tehreek-e-Insaf, confirmed that Reham wants to get actively get involved with his politics and sees herself a future first lady. 

Reaction to the rumoured marriage has been very negative in Pakistan and there has been a backlash on social media.

Photos of Reham in revealing clothes and a video of her doing a tango while working for the BBC are prompting insulting comments in the conservative Islamic country.

Aleema said that the family would be happy if Khan married a 'good person' but that the whole country would participate in the decision

Rival political parties are jumping on the negative reaction and believe it will harm his credibility to marry a divorcee with an apparently chequered past.

Reham, who was born in Libya to Pakistani parents, has three children from her previous marriage to a doctor.

Khan's Tehreek-e-Insaf party currently holds the third largest bloc of seats in the country's parliament, but has accused the ruling Pakistan Muslim League and Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif of vote-rigging, and argue they should have more.

In the past Khan has launched personal attacks on Mr Sharif, calling for the embattled leader, who won the 2013 general election by an apparent landslide, to resign.
