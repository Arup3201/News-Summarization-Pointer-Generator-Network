Rickie Lambert's fairy tale career came full circle on Monday when the one-time Liverpool reject and beetroot factory worker made a £4million return to his hometown team.

The 32-year-old England striker admitted that he is still struggling to take in the events of the past week after Liverpool made a surprise move to sign him from Southampton.

Lambert, a boyhood Liverpool fan who has a Liver bird tattooed on his shoulder, spent five years at the club as a youngster before he was turned away at the age of 15.

His homecoming was confirmed on Monday after he passed a medical and agreed terms on a two-year deal on Sunday before joining England's World Cup squad on the flight to Miami.

'I can't believe it,' said Lambert. 'I've loved this club all my life. I left here 17 years ago, and I haven't stopped loving it since. To be back here now having just signed at the age of 32 is hard to describe.

'Obviously I have always dreamt of playing for Liverpool, but I did kind of think the chance of playing for them had gone.

'It was a shock when I heard Liverpool were in for me. I'm not going to say the words I said to my agent when he first told me – I thought he was lying. I've been trying to let it sink in for a week and it still hasn't.

'My mum 
and dad shed a few tears when I told them, especially my mum. It's not 
just playing for Liverpool, it's the fact I'm coming home. I've been 
away for eight years.

'It's
 going to be hard to keep my emotions in check the first time I pull on 
the Liverpool shirt, I'm not going to lie. It's going to be very 
emotional, not just for me but also for my family.'

Lambert
 worked his way up through every division of the Football League, 
briefly earning £20-a-day putting the lids on jars of beetroot at a 
factory in Lancashire to make ends meet.

Will Lambert be a success at Liverpool?

His
 record of 117 goals in 235 appearances helped fire Southampton from 
League One into the Premier League, earning him an England call-up last 
summer at the age of 31.

Southampton
 gave their blessing to his return to Liverpool and Lambert wrote an open letter to thank everyone involved with the club during his
 five-year stay at St Mary's.

It
 read: 'When I grew up there was only one club I loved. I can honestly 
say now I have two clubs which will always be in my heart and that is 
thanks to the Saints fans.

'Southampton
 have allowed me to realise a lifelong ambition by joining Liverpool FC 
and taking my family home. The five-year plan when I arrived was to get 
this club from League One to the top half of the Premier League. Against
 all the odds we have achieved that.'

Liverpool's
 move for Lambert has raised eyebrows in some quarters because Brendan 
Rodgers was so quick to offload another target man, Andy Carroll, when 
he was first appointed at Anfield.

However, the Liverpool boss insists that many people do not appreciate Lambert' s other qualities.He
 said: 'I've seen Rickie Lambert over the years and he's one of those 
players that probably never got the recognition for what a really good 
footballer he is.

'It's only late on in his career – at 29, 30, 31 – that people are really starting to focus on his qualities.

'He
 was probably seen as the traditional big number nine, a British striker
 that is good in the air. But he's one of the most accomplished 
footballers I've seen.'
