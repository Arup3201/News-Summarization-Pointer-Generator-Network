Justin Welby said he treated the tragedy, in which his seven-month old daughter was killed, as a 'constant reminder of the uncertainty of life’

The Archbishop of Canterbury revealed yesterday his heartbreak at the loss of his baby daughter in a car crash 31 years ago.

Justin Welby said he treated the tragedy France in 1983, in which his seven-month old daughter was killed, as a 'constant reminder of the uncertainty of life’.

In an emotional interview on Desert Island Discs, he also recalled meeting a tearful Sir Winston Churchill for lunch.

The Archbishop told Radio 4 presenter Kirsty Young that he and his wife Caroline, who have five other children, mark each anniversary of Johanna's death.

‘The thing is to celebrate the person, to remember them with love, to remember what they gave and what you gave them,' he said. 

‘In other words, attack the day so it does not attack you.'

Remembering happy childhood summers spent with his mother Jane Gillian in Norfolk, the Archbishop described meeting with Sir Winston Churchill.

Once she took him for tea with the former Prime Minister when he was very young as she had been his private secretary.

‘I remember a very, very old man,’ he said. ‘And he cried, I don’t know why. And because he cried, I cried. And then we sat and had tea. I’ve talked to her about it and she said “Well, he cried quite a lot”.’

These stays with his mother contrasted to ‘rather more complicated times’ in London with his father, who died of a heart attack in 1977.

The Archbishop  revealed how he suffered a ‘grim’ childhood Christmas with his alcoholic father who stayed in bed all day.

He went out and wandered the streets after being left to cope alone by his father Gavin, but everything was shut and he returned to the house to try to find something to eat.

The Archbishop also told how his childhood ‘felt very painful at times’ after his parents divorced when he was only three. He realised when he was about 12 that his businessman father, who he described as ‘very full of rage and anger’, had a drink problem.

Recalling his miserable Christmas, he said: ‘I think I went out once or twice but, you know, everything was closed. I didn’t know really what to do with myself.

‘I suspect I watched telly a bit and sort of scrounged around the fridge for something to eat.

‘A sandwich? I can’t remember. But it was a grim day. That was a grim, grim day.’ 

He admitted suffering from ‘imposter syndrome’ in which he was assailed by worries about his ability for the demanding role of leading the Church of England.

There were also moments of frustration about tensions within the Anglican church over issues such as same-sex marriage. On a lighter note, however, he told how he found doing the ironing was a good time for contemplation and prayer.

And, while his family plays the ‘noisy’ card game Racing Demon, he sings the 1961 hit The Lion Sleeps Tonight by The Tokens.

It was included in the Archbishop’s song selections along with another of his favourites, You’ll Never Walk Alone by Gerry and the Pacemakers.

This was a tribute to Liverpool, where he was Dean for nearly four years. He added: ‘I remember being at Anfield [stadium] on the anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster and this being sung, and going back to the cathedral and finding Everton and Liverpool scarves all over and this amazing, wonderful, poor, battered, thrusting, lively, humorous city coming together.’

The Archbishop also chose a Sudanese religious song after having recently returned from a visit there because of ‘that sense of their faith and trust in and joy – God in the midst of absolute horror’.

With the Bible given to all castaways, the Archbishop selected Gibbon’s historical tome The Decline And Fall Of The Roman Empire as his book.

His luxury item was the complete box set of the US political drama West Wing.
