An innovative hotel shaped like a giant pearl could soon be floating on the waters off the Gold Coast.

The Sea Pearl Hotel, the creation of Professor Jianping Zheng, will feature 300 rooms, a casino and an underwater restaurant.

Mr Zheng believes the Broadwater in the Gold Coast as a 'perfect' location for his $250million development, which he hopes will become one of Australia's iconic landmarks - much like the Sydney Opera House.

The professor of Zhejiang University, in Hangzhou which is southwest of Shanghai, visited Australia as part of the Australia China Chamber of CEO's G20 lead up event - the inaugural Intelligent Green 20 Forum.

Also known as the iG20, the forum was also in collaboration with the Brisbane Global Cafe on November 12 and 13 to discuss sustainable technologies and practices for economic benefits.

This is when Mr Zheng, who's developed more than 200 theme parks and hotels in China such as the Sheraton Moon Hotel, unveiled his vision for the Gold Coast Integrated Resort and Cruise Ship Terminal in southeastern Queensland - the proposed home for the Sea Pearl Hotel.

The spokesman for Marie Stephens Properties, the developers of the floating hotel, told Daily Mail Australia Mr Zheng hopes his futuristic designs 'make a statement as big as the Opera House did for Sydney'.

Mr Zheng is renouned for his innovative designs, including the 'Insect Hall' which is known as the world’s largest insect museum

The professor also designed the Forest Tourism Complex - China's first open travel shopping mall

Shane Reynolds, who says the development of the hotel will cost about $250million, added Mr Zheng believes the proposed cruise ship terminal is a 'perfect' location for his hotel.

The hotel will also feature shopping malls, a sky viewing deck, night light entertainment, a swimming pool, restaurants, presidential suites pods next to the main landmark and an exhibition centre.

However the mayor of Gold Coast Council, Tom Tate, told Daily Mail Australia the hotel isn't a new concept and no formal proposal has been put forward to the council.

'I have only heard about and seen the project through the newspaper,' he said.

'I understand the design concept is about six years old and not originally for the Broadwater.

'There is little else to add as the proponent has not approached council.'

Despite this, the executive of Marie Stephens Properties says their brief discussion about the project with Queensland Premier Campbell Newman on Wednesday was met with a positive response.

Marie Stephens says the company will be travelling to China next week to meet with Mr Zheng, who left for China on Sunday, 'to discuss the planning and approval process for the proposed development'.
