The Duchess of Cambridge has taken refuge with her parents while she is 'struggling terribly' with her debilitating antenatal sickness.

Kate, 32, who is around ten weeks pregnant with her second child, retreated to her family home in Bucklebury, Berkshire, this week with her son, Prince George.

Sources said the Duchess 'hasn't been at all well' as she battles hyperemesis gravidarum, which causes severe vomiting in expectant mothers.

Indeed, Kate has been so sick that aides have been forced to cancel all her forthcoming engagements until at least the week after next.

Her mother Carole Middleton has apparently helped to take charge of her recovery and has been researching alternative sickness cures, such as herbal tea, on the internet.

And despite the presence of Spanish nanny Maria Borallo, Mrs Middleton has also been taking George off her daughter's hands. She has been seen in local shops with her 15-month-old grandson, prompting one startled assistant to write on Twitter: 'Served Kate Middleton's mum and Prince George today at work. He is gorgeous!'

The Duchess says she feels far more relaxed at the Middleton family's £5million Georgian mansion, Bucklebury Manor, than at Kensington Palace.

One source told the Mail: 'Kate is feeling so lousy that she just wanted to be with her family and out of public view.

'She
 is extremely close to Carole, who is very much a hands-on grandmother. 
Between her and their nanny, Maria, Kate has all the help she needs with
 George while she is feeling so sick.

'And Bucklebury is somewhere she can just relax and be herself.'

The
 Duchess – who has now returned to London – has not been seen in public 
since palace officials were forced to announce her pregnancy last month,
 several weeks earlier than intended due to her sickness.

Kate
 was hospitalised with hyperemesis gravidarum and severe dehydration 
during her first pregnancy with George. But doctors have been better 
prepared this time and may, some medical experts have suggested, even 
have treated her with a drip at home.

A source added: 'Don't be fooled by the fact that she hasn't been admitted to hospital this time. She is just as poorly. The difference is that her doctors have been able to diagnose and treat her quicker. She really hasn't been at all well, though.'

The Duchess was forced to cancel her first solo overseas visit – a trip to Malta – last month because of the severity of her condition. Last week she also reluctantly cancelled a visit to a project by The Art Room in London and several other forthcoming engagements have now been scratched out of her diary.

Buckingham Palace announced yesterday that she is expected to take part in the state visit of the president of the Republic of Singapore on October 21. However, a source warned: 'Her attendance will be reviewed closer to the time, depending on her health.'

Caitlin Dean, of the charity Pregnancy Sickness Support, said: 'Hyperemesis gravidarum is not morning sickness. It is a chronic and debilitating condition that can cause sufferers to vomit up to 30 times a day.'

Hyperemesis gravidarum affects about 15 per cent of all pregnancies.

The condition is thought to be caused by elevated levels of ‘pregnancy hormone’ HCG, or human chorionic gonadotropin, which increases after conception.

It causes severe vomiting and can lead to dehydration, weight loss and a build-up of toxins in the blood or urine, called ketosis.

It is much more serious than the nausea commonly experienced by expectant mothers.

The severe dehydration puts both mother and baby at risk of being deprived of essential nutrients and sufferers can be left vomiting up to 30 times a day, with exhausting and hazardous consequences.

They cannot eat or drink without retching and may lose up to 10 per cent of their body weight when they are supposed to be gaining about 1lb a week.

It can trigger a build-up of toxins in the blood or urine known as ketosis as the body tries to compensate for lack of food.

Hyperemesis sufferers can also experience acid reflux, where stomach acid keeps repeating up the throat.

Hospital treatment for these women is essential, as without intravenous feeding and fluids they are at risk of becoming dangerously dehydrated.

Treatment typically includes an injection of the drug heparin to protect against blood clots triggered by dehydration, as well as supplementation of vitamin B, one of the vitamins most depleted by the condition.

An intravenous infusion of saline for rehydration is standard practice.

The condition can also affect the baby’s development and there is a risk it will be premature or have a very low birth weight. In severe cases, the sickness can trigger a miscarriage.
