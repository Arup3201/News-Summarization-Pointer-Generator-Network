Killed: Police say Janaki Rose Hayes didn't hear the train that ran her down while she was jogging because her headphones were playing music too loudly

A California woman was struck and killed Wednesday by a freight train while wearing headphones as she jogged along busy tracks near a popular hiking trail.

Janaki Rose Hayes, 27, of Truckee, was wearing headphones that fully covered her ears and did not hear the blaring horn as the steel beast bared down on her around 1.45 p.m., police said.

Investigators believe she was jogging towards a trail for the bulk of her workout and that the death was an accident, sources told the Sacramento Bee.

Hayes, who had recently moved from Oregon to the small town just north of Lake Tahoe, was just short of the pedestrian bridge when the Union Pacific train caught up to her, cops said.

‘We concluded from our investigation that her intent was to cross the river at some point to access the Legacy Trail for a jog,’ Police Chief Adam McGill in a news release.

She was headed westbound on the rails. The operators slowed the train but could not stop in time to avoid hitting her.

‘It appears the train operators did not contribute to this accident and did all they could to avoid it,’ said McGill.

The train was eventually brought to a halt and the engineers remained on the scene to aid authorities in the investigation, cops said.

First responders found the woman’s body at the scene.

Footage showed them shielding her body from view of news media with a black tarp just to the left of the locomotive.

The freight train was headed from Sparks, Nevada, to Roseville, California.

It is not clear how many cars were being towed or what the cargo was.

The only passengers on board the train were the operators.

Police do not believe alcohol or drugs contributed to the incident.
