Mosques will take the unprecedented step of urging British Muslims to 'wear the poppy, rather than burn it' this week in a bid to counter claims of being unpatriotic.

Poppy stalls will be set up at around the country leading up to Remembrance Sunday in a move backed by government ministers and the Royal British Legion.

It follows high-profile protests 
in the past by Muslim extremists, including those linked to the hate 
preacher Anjem Choudary, and the murder of Drummer Lee Rigby outside 
Woolwich barracks in south-east London.

Britain's Islamic leaders fear that actions by a minority of extremists have led to a perception amongst some that Muslims are 'unpatriotic' or 'disloyal'.

One example was a protest held in November 2010 when fanatics set fire to a giant paper poppy outside the Albert Hall in central London.

In a bid to tackle that negative perception, the centenary of the First World War next year will be used to highlight that thousands of Muslim soldiers have fought and died for Britain, The Sunday Times reported.

Tomorrow the communities secretary Eric Pickles is expected to visit a Muslim-led poppy stall outside Westminster Cathedral in Central London.

Stalls will also operate at different locations in the capital this week run by the interfaith charity Faiths Forum and at mosques in Leeds, Leicester and Southampton.

Julie Siddiqi, the executive director of the Islamic Society of Great Britain, told The Sunday Times: 'British Muslims should be wearing poppies not burning them.'

She added that the centenary of World War One provided an opportunity to tell young Muslims that 'we are all in this together'.

'How can you question a whole community's loyalty when thousands [of their forefathers] died serving this country?' she said.

An estimated 400,000 Muslims fought in the war as part of the British Indian Army, including the sepoy Khudadad Khan who was awarded the Victoria Cross for an act of bravery in Belgium in 1914.

Historians put numbers of Indians close to 50,000 injured and 8,500 dead on the Western Front during the war. An estimated third to a half of these war-dead were Muslims, who fought and died alongside their fellow Hindu and Sikh countrymen.

The bodies of many of these men were never found and their names are listed on the Menin Gate memorial in Ypres, Belgium.

More than 3.5million soldiers from the Asian subcontinent fought for Britain in World War One and Two, with tens of thousands killed in action.

Referring to both conflicts, Baroness Warsi, minister for faith and communities, said: 'Sikhs, Muslims and Hindus courageously battled and lost their lives for a country they had never seen and for a king who was not from their land.

'It is fantastic that these poppy stalls are raising awareness of this outstanding contribution.'
