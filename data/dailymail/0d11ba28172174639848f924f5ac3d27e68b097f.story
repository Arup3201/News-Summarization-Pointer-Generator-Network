Scam: Children are unwittingly downloading fake versions of popular apps like Angry Birds that charge £15 each time they are used

Children who downloaded a rogue version of the hugely popular Angry Birds game to their smartphones and tablets were hit by a £15 charge every time they opened it.

Details have been revealed by industry regulators amid evidence tech firms are targeting children who are unwittingly running up massive bills.

Some youngsters are generating bills of more than £500, which are charged to their mobile phone accounts or their parents’ credit cards.

PhonepayPlus, which regulates paid for mobile phone content, has seen a 300per cent increase in complaints related to children and app downloads in the past year.

Computer game apps such as Angry Birds and Minecraft, are proving enormously popular with youngsters – often replacing traditional toys.

Legitimate tech companies offer free game downloads to youngsters, which fire up their interest and get them hooked.

However, they then try and cash in by selling coins or other types of currency, through so-called in-app purchases, to be used in the game.

These charges are automatically applied to a credit card that a parent has linked to a particular account with Apple’s iTunes store, which offers thousands of apps, or similar web services.

Some rogues have tried to cash in on popular games by creating their own unauthorised versions that plant so-called malware on to smartphones and tablets.

A spokesman for PhonepayPlus said: ‘In one case, children as young as 11 years old downloaded free versions of popular games from the Android app store such as Angry Birds, Assassin’s Creed and Cut the Rope.

‘These fake apps charged £15 to the user’s phone bill every time the app was opened without the user’s knowledge.’

Opportunist: The firms are exploiting the popularity of Angry Birds, a wildly successful downloadable game

The watchdog has also found that companies are using social media sites, such as Facebook, which are accessed via smartphones and tablets, to con children and their parents out of money.

It said: ‘In one case a 14 year old girl was tricked into paying for virtual credits in a game when a social media ‘friend’ said she had no credits to phone her dying grandmother.’

In another case, children between 12-14 year olds were tricked into ‘sharing’ and ‘liking’ a promotion for supermarket vouchers from Tesco and Asda on Facebook.

The promotion spread to thousands of youngsters and misled them into taking part in a premium rate competition.

More than 89,000 youngsters were taken in by the scam, which meant they were charged £5 every time a trivia question was sent to their phone.

The use of the famous name supermarkets helped convince the children that the promotion was legitimate, however the stores had nothing to do with the scam.

In that case, the two companies responsible for the promotion were fined a total of £450,000 and ordered to make refunds to victims of the con.

Apple operates a password system on its iPhone and iPads, which should allow parents to block in-app purchases. Parents can also block any payments by changing the settings, however many are unaware of this.

These same protections do not exist with other devices and app download sites.

Last year, six-year-old Jake Sadler, spent £1,000 playing Zombie Takeover, which was free to download - on his mother's iPad.

His parents only discovered the problem after receiving a call for their bank's fraud team who had concerns with 'unusual activity' on their account.

Jake's mother Gemma, 31, a nursing support assistant, from Portsmouth, said: 'We had no idea the money was even going out of our account until the fraud squad at the bank rang us.

'And when we looked at our bank account and found such a large amount of money missing I felt absolutely sick.'

The chief executive of PhonepayPlus, Paul Whiteing(correct), said: ‘Connected devices will define the age in which today’s children live and we are determined to ensure that they can receive the benefits while being protected from the risks.

‘Smartphones in children’s pockets can burn holes in parent’s wallets, so we are working with partners across industry and other agencies to prevent this.’

It advises parents to ask their mobile network what controls are available to block risky services. Advice on safe use is also available from the phonebrain.org website.
