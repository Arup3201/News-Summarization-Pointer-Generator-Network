Grand Designs presenter Kevin McCloud is to host the first television appeal ever made by the charity set up in the memory of Stephen Lawrence.

He will hail the Stephen Lawrence Charitable Trust for helping young people from disadvantaged backgrounds to ‘smash through barriers’ in pursuit of their dream careers.

The trust, founded by the murdered teenager’s mother in 1998, already has a proven track record of helping students into architecture, the profession which Stephen had wanted to enter since the age of seven.

It has awarded over 100 architecture bursaries and so far many students have gone on to qualify as architects while the others have succeeded in associated areas.

With a staff of just six and entirely funded by donations, the Trust has already reached more than 1,500 people attending workshops at the iconic Stephen Lawrence Centre, providing events, courses and programmes to help them to aim high and overcome barriers to employment- and encourages young people to strive to become lawyers and journalists too.

Mr McCloud, who has presented the unusual homebuilding show Grand Designs on Channel Four since 1999, said: ‘What I find extraordinary about the Stephen Lawrence Charitable Trust is that they allow people to realise their dream and to smash through barriers.’

He will present the Lifeline Appeal, a monthly slot on the BBC in which a well-known personality introduces the vital work of a charity they care about and appeals for donations, on Sunday (Feb 22) at 4.45pm on BBC1. It will be repeated on BBC2 on February 25 at 1pm on BBC2.

The appeal features Eniola Asaolu who grew up in a tough area of North London and faced the choice of either joining a gang or becoming a victim of one until his fortunes changed when he won a place on a Stephen Lawrence Scholarship scheme at top City law firm Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer.

It also tells how the trust helped Lisa Basu overcome the financial obstacles of an architect’s seven-year training. She couldn’t afford materials for her models while at university and was using pizza boxes, but thanks to a bursary from the trust was able to complete her studies.

Mr McCloud said: ‘What I find extraordinary about the Stephen Lawrence Charitable Trust is that they allow people to realise their dream and to smash through barriers.’

Baroness Lawrence said: ‘We are here as a catalyst so we can support them in whatever profession they want to go into.’

A-level student Stephen was stabbed to death aged 18 in an unprovoked racist attack at a bus stop in Eltham, South East London, in 1993. He excelled at art and maths and got himself a placement at a big London architect firm before his murder.

The Mail campaigned to bring the killers to justice and published a landmark front page accusing five men of the murder. Two were convicted in 2012.

Last month, the Stephen Lawrence Charitable Trust and the Mail announced two journalism scholarships.
