Controversy: Father Dennis Higgins has angered parents by telling children at a school mass that Father Christmas is not real

An elderly priest has been labelled as 'plain mean' after telling primary school children as young as seven that Santa Claus did not exist.

Father Dennis Higgins, in his 80s, was attempting to teach pupils the true meaning of Christmas while delivering mass at a school in Buxton, Derbyshire.

But his stark words were said to have upset the younger children and angered parents - who accused the clergyman of ruining the 'magic of Christmas'.

Other members of the priest's congregation quickly leapt to his defence, setting up a Facebook page called Support Father Higgins and posting a series of kind messages calling him an 'honest' and 'courageous' man.

The mass was attended by children from St Anne's primary school and older pupils, aged 11-12, from St Thomas More Catholic School - both in Buxton, Derbyshire.

One parent, who did not wish to be identified, said: 'How dare he say such things to such young children? 

'To try and take away the magic of Christmas is just plain mean.

'It really saddens me that someone who people should respect and look up to can do something so mean.'

When Father Higgins, who is based at St Anne's Catholic Church in Buxton, was asked to explain his comments he launched into a foul-mouthed tirade.

But supporters of the priest who rallied to his defence have called him an 'honest' and 'courageous' man on Facebook.

His support page reads: 'This page is being set up on behalf of Father Dennis Higgins who has dedicated his life to God and the Church. He has been a pillar of Buxton's community.'

Sue Burkinshaw wrote: 'Father Higgins is in his 80s, he's a good and decent man, still working when he could have retired long ago bless him. 

'Can't see many parents working as hard as he does when they reach that age. Get a grip.'

Sheryl Anne Ellison added: 'I know Father Dennis, he keeps it real in every sense, even with regard to the bible and gospel.

Defence: Many churchgoers rallied behind the priest - even setting up this Support Father Dennis Higgins Facebook page

'He is an honest, true, courageous man, who strives for justice, fairness and compassion.

'I have nothing but respect for the man and I think those who spew bile should aim it in another direction, certainly not at him.

Reassurance: Brendan Hickey, headmaster at St Thomas More Catholic School, told pupils they could still expect a visit from Father Christmas

'The school is Catholic, Christmas is a Christian festival celebrating the birth of Christ. If you send your kids - deal with it.'

Father Andrew Cole, spokesman for the Catholic Diocese of Nottingham, which includes Buxton and the surrounding area, has apologised for Father Higgins' 'intemperate language'.

He said: 'Christmas is a wonderful time of the year, especially for our children.

'On the first Christmas Day, God gave us his most precious gift, Jesus, who shows us how to love God and one another.

'We celebrate Jesus' birth in Bethlehem by putting up Christmas trees and decorations, singing carols, sending cards, giving each other presents, and spending time with those we love most.

'Father Christmas is always a welcome visitor in our homes, and we will all be looking forward to his arrival on Christmas Day, including me.'

Brendan Hickey, headmaster at St Thomas More Catholic School, has since tried to repair some of the damage and reassure younger children that Father Christmas will soon be paying them a visit. 

He said: 'I want to reassure all year three pupils at St Anne's, and their parents, that I have personally spoken to Father Christmas and told him about what has happened.

'He was sorry to hear about the confusion and has promised me that he will arrange for his elves to write to each of the children and reassure them that he will definitely be coming to visit them this Christmas.'
