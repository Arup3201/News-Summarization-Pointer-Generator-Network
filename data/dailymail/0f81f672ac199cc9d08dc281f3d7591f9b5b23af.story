Kenny Dalglish will present Luis Suarez with his Golden Shoe award next Wednesday in Barcelona at the special request of the Uruguayan striker.

Suarez was signed by then Liverpool manager Dalgish in 2011 and the two will be reunited next week when the forward picks the award for his 31 goals last season.

The Barcelona forward wanted the Scot and former captain Steven Gerrard at the event – Liverpool's captain will not be able to attend but their former boss will fly to Spain on Wednesday morning for the award presentation.

Dalglish had a close bond with Suarez at Liverpool and staunchly defended his former charge when he was found guilty of racially abusing Patrice Evra.

Suarez also wants to parade the award at Anfield at some point but with his ban now just 15 days from finishing logistics may prevent him from doing so.

Liverpool’s next home game is against Hull on October 25 but their former star will be busy that day – playing his first competitive game for Barcelona, in the Clasico in Real Madrid’s Bernabeu Stadium.

Lionel Messi, Suarez's Barcelona team-mate won the Golden Shoe in the last two seasons.

The Uruguyan actually shares the honour this time with Cristiano Ronaldo, who also scored 31 goals last season.

Suarez’s haul enabled him to beat the previous record for one season at Liverpool, beating Robbie Fowler, who scored 28 goals in 1995-96.

Suarez faces Saudi Arabia on Friday in one of two international friendlies that he will play ahead of his comeback against Real Madrid in two weeks' time.
