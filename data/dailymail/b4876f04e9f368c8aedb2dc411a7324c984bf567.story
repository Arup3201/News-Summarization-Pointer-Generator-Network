Swedish police left an armed robber fighting for his life after they shot him in the head during a dramatic lunchtime fire-exchange.

The 26-year-old man and three accomplices armed with AK47 assault rifles robbed a small jewellery shop in a shopping centre – located just 200 metres (650 ft) from the police station.

When the gang made a dash for their getaway car they were surprised by civilian dressed police and began a shoot-out in front of shocked bystanders on the high street in Sodertalje, 22 miles south of the Swedish capital Stockholm.

The shoot-out was filmed by witnesses using a mobile phone and the video found its way to Swedish newspapers yesterday.

The video shows the robbers’ getaway car waiting outside and two policemen in civilian clothing with their guns raised.

There is an exchange of fire in the middle of the high street until the 26-year-old is hit. The rest of the gang flee in the grey car, leaving the man bleeding in the street.

Two men, 19 and 22, have been arrested on suspicion of robbery and a female relative of the 19-year-old, aged 21, is also under arrest accused of aiding the men.

A fourth man, aged 22, was later arrested accused of harbouring a criminal.
