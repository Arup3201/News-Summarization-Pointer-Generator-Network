Barcelona seem to be making the most of the close season by turning part of their famous Nou Camp stadium into a restaurant.

The Catalan giants ended the season without any silverware, but are still one of the most popular teams in Europe and their restaurant overlooking the pitch is sure to be a winner with fans.

The restaurant is open to those who wish to look round the stadium on the Nou Camp tour and also those who wish to stay a little longer and have a full meal.

More than a club: Barcelona have opened a pitch-side restaurant at the Nou Camp

The restaurant is open from now until mid-August.
