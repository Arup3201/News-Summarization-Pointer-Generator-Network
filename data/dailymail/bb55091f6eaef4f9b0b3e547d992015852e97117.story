A CNBC anchor, former Wall Street economist and Ronald Reagan adviser has told how he's still struggling with his decades-long drug and alcohol addiction, even though he has been sober for 18 years.

Larry Kudlow, 66, made his emotional speech to a 500-strong audience at the annual black tie Silver Hill Hospital Gala at the exclusive Cipriani restaurant on 42nd street in Midtown Manhattan on Wednesday.

Kudlow, who checked in for long-term treatment at Hazelden rehab clinic in 1995, made a public confession of his drug problem after he was forced to resign as chief economist at Bear Stearns the year before.

‘I never believed I could be clean and sober, it’s been 18 years-plus. I was at Hazelden for five months; they helped me a lot.’ 

But according to Kudlow, who is the host of CNBC's The Kudlow Report, his rehab stint was not a cheap affair and called for people to donate money to make the programs available to everyone.

‘I needed long-term care, and I didn’t have any money. I’d spent it on my addiction,’ he told the audience.

‘This was the end of the line. I was 
unemployable. My wonderful wife had stopped enabling me, and filed for 
divorce. We’ve been married 26 years, but at that moment it was very 
difficult.’

Kudlow, who has been married three times, tied the knot in 1986 with his current wife, Judith 'Judy' Pond, a painter and a former Montana native.

In the mid-1990s, Kudlow entered a twelve-step program in order to deal with his addiction to cocaine and alcohol. He subsequently converted to Catholicism under the guidance of Father C. John McCloskey III.

To Wednesday night's glamorous audience, Kudlow said: ‘I told my 
counselor, “I need help. I surrender, I am on my knees. I am powerless”.
 She said, “We are going to invest in you”. And I broke down and cried. I
 stayed, and things got better. It was a turning point for me. It has 
given me a new career, which I never even saw coming.

What a couple: Dr. Sigurd Ackerman and singer/musician Cyndi Lauper attended the lavish event

‘Only,
 I was sober enough to walk through the door when it was open. I show up
 every night and do my job to be a broadcaster on TV and radio, but most
 of all I am a recovering alcoholic, and I never forget that.’

The Silver Hill Gala, which has been running for four years, was created by Michael Cominotto and his husband, Dennis Basso.

The duo has managed to raise more than $4.5 million to fund programs for adolescents and young adults, according to the Post.

Peter and Beverly Orthwein were also honoured at the event where guests included Amy Fine Collins, Nina Griscom, Alex Hitz, Debbie Bancroft and Eva Lorenzotti.

The event also saw a performance by singer Cyndi Lauper.
