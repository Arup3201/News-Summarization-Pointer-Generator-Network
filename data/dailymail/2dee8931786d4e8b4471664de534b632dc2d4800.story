A Louisiana man gave his newborn son a name just like his own, but instead of simply calling him 'Junior,' Jack Daniels named his son Jim Beam.

Jack Daniels Leathers, 31, was just turning rebellion into tradition.

'My parents decided they wanted to name their son something to make their parents mad,' Jack told Houma Today.

'And, at the time, my dad was drinking Jack, which he enjoyed,' he explained. 'My mom said, "Why not?"'

'Nobody believed my name until I showed them my ID,' Jack said about the name, which also made him popular during his time in the military.

'When I went into the Army, sergeants would yell, "How much more American can you get than Jack Daniels?"'

'I went through most of my Army career not hearing my last name because people would call me Jack Daniels, he said.'

Jack brought up the story of his name on his first date with Lydia, and the couple decided then to name their first-born Jim Beam, after the Kentucky bourbon.

They even kept the beverage theme running through their wedding, which was officiated by Houma's Judge Johnny Walker.

'I've always tried to do stuff out of the ordinary, to do things differently than other people,' said Lydia.

'It's hard to find a name that you like that nobody you know has. It was all Jack's idea. I just went along with it.'
