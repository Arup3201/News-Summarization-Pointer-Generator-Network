West Ham have had a £2million bid rejected for Hamilton left-back Stephen Hendrie.

The highly-rated 20-year-old is out of contract in the summer and has been attracting interest from a number of Premier League clubs.

Hendrie has made more than 100 appearances for the Scottish Premiership side and said earlier this month that he was ready to move to a big club.

‘I don’t think 20 is too young or too old to move from Hamilton. I’m a Celtic fan and obviously the Premier League is one of the best leagues in the world,' Hendrie said.

‘That’s my dream - you want to reach as high a level as you can and if I can get to the Premier League that would be brilliant. 

Norwich, who recently appointed former Hamilton manager Alex Neil, are also interested in the 20-year-old full back.

Meanwhile, the Hammers have approached Arsenal about making Carl Jenkinson's move a permanent one and have been quoted a whopping £12m for the right back.

The England Under 21 international is on a season-long loan at Upton Park and has impressed manager Sam Allardyce with his performances and attitude but a permanent deal will be difficult to seal at that price.

The 22-year-old has made 20 appearances already this season as opposed to 22 in the whole of the last campaign with Arsenal.

Arsenal defender Carl Jenkinson has been in impressive form since joining the Hammers on loan

Allardyce believes two or three extra additions will shape his squad into regular top-six contenders and the purchase of Jenkinson would not only be good continuity but prove a good investment for the future.

However, West Ham will struggle to meet Arsenal's demands. They will reassess their budget in the summer and hope that Jenkinson can also push for the move.
