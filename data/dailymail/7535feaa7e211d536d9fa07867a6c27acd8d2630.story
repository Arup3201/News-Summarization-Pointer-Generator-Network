The distraught father of the three young girls allegedly stabbed to death by their mother has spoken out for the first time saying she acted like ‘a demon possessed.’

Carol Coronado, 30, was found in bed with the bloody bodies of her children, Sophia, 3, Yazmine, 1, and two-month-old Xenia, on Tuesday evening near Torrance in Los Angeles County, according to police.

Her husband Rodolfo was outside working on his car and her mother, Julie Piercey, was the first to raise the alarm.

Devastated Rodolfo, tears streaming down his face, told MailOnline: 'I don’t know why the hell this happened, she killed my babies man, she killed my babies.

'It was 
like a demon possessed. She was a girl with a good career ahead of her, I
 just don’t know why it happened. If I knew why it happened, it would 
answer all my questions.’

Rodolfo spoke out from his mother's home in nearby Carson, California. The family asked 
for privacy and said there would be no further statement at this time.

Earlier in the day, he and his sister went back to the couple's home to collect some belongings. He covered his face with a cloth, clearly distraught, as he left the home.

Specialist
 homicide police are still questioning Carol Coronado and have said 
there is no further update to the statement they issued late yesterday 
night.

She has refused to speak to police or shed light on what led her to allegedly slaughter all three of her children.

'The babies were on the bed,' Los Angeles County Sheriff's Lt. Dave Coleman said.'And not in a haphazard fashion, they were placed on the bed, so how and where they were killed, we're going to have to figure that out.'

Investigators were reviewing Coronado's medical records and her service in the military. She joined the Army after high school but only spent a few months in the service before being released due to an injury, Coleman said.

Police said Mrs Coronado was found naked and holding a knife after reportedly trying to cut her own wrists.

Detectives said on Wednesday that there were several knives recovered at a bloody scene.

Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies were called to an unincorporated area shortly after 5pm on Tuesday, the Sheriff's Department said.

'When they 
arrived, they were met by family members who told the deputies that a 
mother had killed her children,' the statement said.

Rodolfo collapsed on the street as police led him away from his home after finding his daughters dead, neighbors said

Inside
 the home, detectives found a horrific scene of three young girls laying
 dead in a pool of blood on the family bed. The children were pronounced
 dead at the scene.

'The deputies were directed to the house by the grandmother,' sheriff's homicide Lt. Dave Coleman told the Daily Breeze of Torrance. 'We did find the babies inside the residence.'

Neighbor
 Ashley Madrid told the Daily Breeze that the children's father, who 
according to public records is Rodolfo Coronado, was working on his car 
across the street when his mother-in-law discovered her daughter and the
 three children in a pool of blood on a bed.

'I saw when they were bringing him out,' Ms Madrid said. 'He was crying. He was crying, ''She killed my daughters!'"

Madrid said she was told the mother had a kitchen knife in her hand and was trying to cut her wrists.

Police have not released a motive for the murders. Coronado's mother and her husband were home at the time

Sheriff's
 deputies took the mother, who was naked except for a blanket, to a 
patrol car and she was then placed in an ambulance, Madrid said.

'She was full of blood on her face and arms,' Madrid said

Ms
 Madrid said the children's grandmother told her that the woman had 
called earlier in the day and said that she was going crazy. The 
grandmother had stopped by to visit her grandchildren.

Carol
 Coronado, 30, was arrested on suspicion of murder, taken to a hospital 
for examination and then to a sheriff's station for booking. Authorities
 say she made no statement.

Her 
Facebook page was filled with pictures of the baby girls. The main 
background picture on her page is a composite of her two eldest girls 
and an ultrasound image of her youngest daughter.

Police have not commented on any possible motive for the murders.
