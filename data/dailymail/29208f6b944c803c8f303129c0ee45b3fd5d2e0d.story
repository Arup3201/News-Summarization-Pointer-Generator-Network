The devastating bushfires which swept across parts of South Australia and Victoria in recent weeks have left many native animals burnt, orphaned and homeless.

After an appeal last week the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW) were inundated with mittens for koalas who had their paws scorched in the fires, but now it's the little joeys who need help.

Many joeys, some very young, have been left injured and without their mothers and so wildlife carers need pouches they can keep the native animals warm and safe in.

The International Fund for Animal Welfare are appealing for cotton pouches to care for joeys left injured and orphaned from the bushfires

'It's not just koalas that have been affected by these fires,' Josey Sharrad from IFAW told Daily Mail Australia.

She said kangaroos, wallabies, possums and many other species had also been severely affected by the out-of-control infernos and so Project Pouch was launched. 

'Vets and wildlife carers use very simple cotton pouches to keep these animals warms,' Ms Sharrad said.

'The good thing about the pouches is that wildlife carers use these pouches all year around.'

Those caring for the injured or orphaned native animals can go through up to six pouches a day she added, and so it is important for there to be a stockpile of them. 

Many of the joeys also had their feet and paws scorched in the blaze and so they've been wrapped up in bandages to help their injuries heal.

The pattern for people wishing to sew pouches is available on the IFAW website, and there are five different sizes the organisation is appealing for.

IFAW has asked the members of the Australian public send the pouches to their Sydney office, but despite receiving mittens from Europe, the UK, Germany, China and many other parts of the world have suggested international donors sit this one out.

Anyone outside of Australia who still wishes to support these little joeys can donate on the organisation's website, or support one of the local initiatives IFAW is conducting closer to home. 

The cotton pouches are also used to care for other native wildlife such as possums and wombats
