A pensioner died after an ambulance crew finished their lunchbreak before answering a call – and were then left struggling to locate his home because the service’s satnav-style database was out of date.

When diabetic Albert Jobson, 76, fell ill at his home in Ilfracombe, Devon, in March wife Dolores called her doctors.

A GP visited him and rang South West Ambulance Service Trust at 11.52am to say he needed to be admitted to hospital within an hour.

But a mix-up meant that a patient transport ambulance was allocated – and it arrived in the town two hours later to say it could not find the address.

Daniel Thorogood, the ambulance trust control officer, told an inquest in Barnstaple: ‘The crew completed their lunch break and then mobilised, which delayed it by 30 minutes.’

He added that the organisation’s street database was two years out of date, which was why crews struggled to find the address.

The transport crew finally arrived at around 2pm but with Mr Jobson’s condition deteriorating his wife had already made a 999 call. An emergency crew arrived at 2.15pm – and another at 2.44pm – but Mr Jobson was pronounced dead at North Devon Hospital in Barnstaple at 3.08pm.

Mrs Jobson said the delays surrounding her husband’s treatment amounted to ‘negligence’.

She said: 'I think the whole thing was negligence with the ambulance not coming within an hour. The family feel he did not have a fighting chance of life.'

The ambulance trust apologised and said its system is now updated quarterly.

Adrian South said from the Trust said: 'I find it upsetting when cases like this occur. I am personally sorry for what happened.

'We have invested to make sure this system is updated on a quarterly basis. The patient transport service has also been privatised so we no longer provide that service.'

The North Devon Coroner recorded a misadventure verdict.

Mr Jobson’s daughter Carol Krosschell said: 'We feel that dad was taken from us due to a catalogue of errors.'
