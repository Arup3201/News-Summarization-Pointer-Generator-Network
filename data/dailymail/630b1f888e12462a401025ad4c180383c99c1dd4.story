England will descend on ‘Mile-High City’ in July for a two-week, high-altitude training camp designed to leave them in peak physical condition ahead of the home World Cup.

Stuart Lancaster has arranged to take an expanded national squad of about 50 players — plus coaches and support staff — to Denver, Colorado, as a means of enhancing their physical condition and escaping the pressurised tournament build-up at home. The city’s nickname is based on its location, which is a mile above sea level at 5,280ft, amid the foothills of the Rocky Mountains.

While in the city, England’s training base will be Infinity Park, in the suburb of Glendale; home of the Glendale Raptors and a venue known as ‘Rugbytown USA’.

Mile up: England coach Stuart Lancaster is ensuring his World Cup squad will be in peak physical condition

Lancaster knows the facilities from his time as head coach of the Saxons, when he and Andy Farrell coached England’s second-string side at the 2009 Churchill Cup in Denver.

A handful of players involved in that event may be back there next summer, including Dan Cole, Rob Webber, Danny Cipriani and Stephen Myler.

It is understood talks began months ago about the notion of temporarily moving England en masse to an alternative location, partly to guard against staleness during the prolonged World Cup countdown.

Various options were discussed before Lancaster decided a return to familiar territory in the States made most sense. Since then, England’s strength and conditioning staff have travelled to Colorado and fully endorse the choice.

The benefits of training at altitude — where the air is thinner so the body has to work harder for oxygen — are well-established in a wide variety of sports. England expect to boost the fitness of their players in terms of accelerating the necessary fat-burning process, but accept that there will not be a respiratory ‘legacy’ by the time the World Cup starts in mid-September.

After having four weeks off at the end of this season, the squad will reconvene for a fortnight at Pennyhill Park then fly across the Atlantic for two weeks in Denver.

At the end of their stay, there is a possibility that Lancaster’s men will take part in a training game against the USA — whose union are based in nearby Boulder, Colorado. However, firm plans are still some way off.

Upon returning home, England will take a week’s break before re-gathering in Surrey ahead of warm-up matches against France, home and away, and Ireland. By then, they will hope to be feeling the benefits of their Stateside excursion.

For Lancaster and his coaches, fitness is a hot topic after the June tour of New Zealand, which concluded with a heavy defeat by the All Blacks in Hamilton that created concerns about the condition of their side.

Three of England’s World Cup-winning women’s team — Margaret Alphonsi, Katherine Merchant and Joanna McGilchrist — have retired from international rugby following their triumph in Paris last month.
