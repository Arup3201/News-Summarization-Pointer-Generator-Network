A series of upcoming spacewalks at the International Space Station have been delayed following fears over faulty spacesuits.

Nasa is now rushing to analyse the existing suits to determine if they are safe to wear. 

The fault is linked to a 2013 emergency when water dangerously flooded a European astronaut’s helmet causing a near-drowning. 

A series of upcoming spacewalks at the International Space Station have been delayed following fears over faulty spacesuits. Nasa is now rushing to analyse the existing suits to determine if they are safe to wear

The first spacewalk by a pair of U.S. astronauts was supposed to occur tomorrow, but Nasa today bumped it to Saturday to complete a spacesuit investigation.

The second spacewalk is now Wednesday; the third is March 1. The extensive, outdoor cable-routing work will prepare for the arrival of new commercial crew capsules in 2017. 

Two critical fan and pump units for the astronauts' spacesuits failed recently during routine maintenance in orbit.

Construction of the ISS began on 20 November 1998.

It supports a crew of up to six, with crews split into groups of three.

The station orbits at a height of about 255 miles (410km).

It has a total mass of about 990,000 pounds (450,000kg) and has living space roughly equivalent to a five-bedroom house.

It completes an orbit of Earth every 92.91 minutes and moves at 17,100 miles (27,600km) per hour.

It has now been in space for more than 5,900 days, during which time it has completed more than 92,000 orbits of Earth, and has been continuously occupied for more than 13 years. 

Engineers suspect water seeped into the bearings, causing them to corrode and seize up.

Both units were returned to Earth on the Dragon capsule last week. Spare units were put in the spacesuits, and those have checked out.

Nasa says a pump failure would cut short a spacewalk, but not endanger anyone. 

An unrelated problem with the same component led to an astronaut's near-drowning in 2013.

Kenny Todd, a space station manager, said earlier this week that the corrosion is likely the result of frequent water sampling put in place after the 2013 episode.

Nasa astronauts Butch Wilmore and Terry Virts are the designated spacewalkers. 

The astronauts will be preparing cables and communications gear for new docking ports at the space station.

The ports will be used by future astronaut crews launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida once the first commercial capsules are ready to fly people beginning in 2017.

The space agency would like to pull off all three spacewalks before Wilmore leaves the orbiting lab in mid-March.

Private companies SpaceX and Boeing are working on crew capsules — under Nasa contract — to ferry U.S. astronauts to and from the space station. 

Nasa lost the ability to launch its own crews when the space shuttles retired in 2011, and is paying Russia for crew transportation.

The issue is related to the water-in-helmet leak that nearly drowned Italian astronaut Luca Parmitano during a spacewalk in July 2013 - he rushed back into the space station and quickly recovered (shown here in this image from the ISS) - but is not expected to cause a similar gush of water

US space agency Nasa says it wants more time to analyse the suits

@highlight

It is related to a problem in 2013 that nearly drowned an astronaut

@highlight

Issue is with fan pump separator, part of suit's temperature system

@highlight

If the pump failed, the astronauts would have to return to the ISS
