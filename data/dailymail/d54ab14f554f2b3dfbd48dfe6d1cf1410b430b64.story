He may have been named after the London station he was found in, but Paddington Bear hailed from deepest, darkest Peru.

And now fans of the loveable children's character are being given the chance to meet the real Paddington Bear in his home country - or at least a distant relative of Michael Bond's famous creation.

The Inkaterra Andean Bear Sanctuary in Machu Picchu is offering people the chance to meet relatives of the much-loved character with a penchant for duffle coats and marmalade sandwiches.

The sanctuary is home to five Andean Spectacled Bears, which are on a list of critically endangered species.

Lucky visitors will be given exclusive access to their enclosure and can shadow the bears' keepers to learn about how the resort is helping them to thrive.

Carmen Soto, Inkaterra's resident naturalist, said: 'The Andean Spectacled Bear has suffered through a gradual destruction of its natural habitat, through agricultural development and an increased human population in South America's Andes Mountains.

'As a consequence, the only species of bear in South America is now in danger of extinction.

'We hope that our continued work, including this new Andean Spectacled Bear package will help in the raising of international awareness of the bears' plight, in order to save this endangered species.'

The package includes a three-night stay at the Inkaterra Machu Picchu Hotel, which is located near the sanctuary, and guests will learn about the life of a keeper at the Andean Spectacled Bear project.

They will also receive a special 'bear kit', which includes a Bear Keeper's certificate and a soft toy Spectacled bear.

Luxury retreat: Prices for the Andean Spectacled Bear Package start from around £620 per guest

Guests will also get a guided tour of the Machu Picchu Citadel, along with two tickets to see the upcoming Paddington Bear film, which is due to be released in October 2014.

Prices for the Andean Spectacled Bear Package start from around £620 per person and a percentage of all proceeds will be donated to the Inkaterra Machu Picchu Spectacled Bear Sanctuary Project.

Paddington Bear first appeared in 1958 when BBC cameraman Michael Bond began writing about a bear he had purchased from Selfridges in London.

The bear - who was named after the station near Bond’s house - wore a duffle coat and Wellington boots and had a penchant for marmalade sandwiches.

The first book was called ‘A Bear Called Paddington’ and since then more than 150 titles have been published and translated into over 40 different languages.
