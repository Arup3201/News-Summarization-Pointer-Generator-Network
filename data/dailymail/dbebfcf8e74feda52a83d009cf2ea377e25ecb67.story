Real Madrid captain Iker Casillas looked like a child who had been sent to the naughty step after appearing to be snubbed by team-mate Alvaro Arbeloa in the tunnel ahead of the Spanish Super Cup first-leg tie with rivals Atletico Madrid.

Substitute Arbeloa was filmed walking past his team-mates who were starting the game, hugging and tapping stars including Gareth Bale, Marcelo and Pepe.

When the defender reached Casillas, however, he appeared to completely blank the goalkeeper and walked on without acknowledging him.

Despite acknowledging and embracing his other team-mates in the tunnel, Arbeloa appeared to blank and ignore his captain before Real met rivals Atletico. 

SPLIT OVER THE SPECIAL ONE

Arbeloa was a fervent supporter of the Portuguese during his reign at Real.

Casillas did not like Mourinho's methods and was dropped during his time in the Spanish capital.

The pair fell out as a result of their difference of opinion. 

SOCIAL MEDIA WAR 

Madrid captain Casillas liked an Instagram post earlier this month criticising fellow stopper Diego Lopez and calling Arbeloa a 'cone'  -referring to the defender's lack of mobility.

Arbeloa responded by retweeting a link a book which referred to Casillas as a 'tumour on Real Madrid'. 

Casillas appeared a little sheepish after the incident and stared into the camera tentatively.

This appears to be just the latest incident in a long feud that has developed between the pair.

While Casillas was a well-known and out-spoken critic of Jose Mourinho during his time in charge of Madrid, Arbeloa was a fervent supporter of the Portuguese.

Casillas even found himself dropped to the bench by Mourinho, and subsequently current boss Carlo Ancelotti, while Arbeloa proved a crucial figure during the self-proclaimed Special One's reign.

Their difference in opinion over Mourinho reportedly led to a breakdown in their relationship, despite them being both Spain and Real Madrid team-mates. 

Earlier this month tensions grew even further between the pair when Arbeloa retweeted a link to a book which referred to Casillas as a 'tumour on Real Madrid'.

The Spanish World Cup-winning goalkeeper, meanwhile, had earlier liked an Instagram post from a fan which criticised fellow stopper Diego Lopez and called Arbeloa a 'cone' - referring to the defender's lack of mobility. 

Real drew 1-1 in the first leg with Atletico.
