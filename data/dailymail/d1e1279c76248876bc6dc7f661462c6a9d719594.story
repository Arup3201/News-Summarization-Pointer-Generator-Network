A pet-obsessed mother and  daughter have been banned from  keeping animals for a decade after 87 cats were discovered in their three-bedroom semi.

Stunned RSPCA inspectors found an ‘unbearable’ scene of animal cruelty after being tipped off by neighbours about a foul smell coming from the house.

Inspectors said cats were crammed in almost every corner of the house, including the loft.

Unbearable scene: inspectors described the scene of the home 87 cats as unbearable after neighbours complained about the smell

Most of the cats discovered by RSPCA inspectors in the house were sick and underweight. Here some of their food bowls can be seen lined up on a kitchen work surface

Margaret and Kara Foster were both ordered to pay £500 while Kara was told to carry out community service

Following the RSPCA search, 13 of the cats had to put down to end their suffering.

Margaret Foster, 65, and her daughter 
Kara, 20, were also handed suspended prison sentences after they pleaded
guilty to two charges of causing unnecessary suffering to animals and 
admitted 13 charges of failing to ensure their welfare.

Kevin McCole, prosecuting for the 
RSPCA, told Leicester magistrates: ‘Most of the cats were extremely 
thin, many had severe problems with their eyes caused by fighting and 
infections and some had to have their eyes removed as a result.

The home in Leicester was described by RSPCA inspectors as 'unbearable'

Inspectors found litter-trays overflowing, and general filth throughout the house

‘All were in need of urgent veterinary treatment.

‘Sadly, 13 were in such a poor state 
of health they had to be put to sleep to end their suffering. The others
were nursed back to health and rehomed.’

RSPCA inspector Sally Kearns 
told the court: ‘It was absolutely unbearable to see. The cats had not 
been neutered and the situation had spiralled out of control, with lots 
of breeding.

‘There were far too many cats for anyone to care for properly.

‘There were cats everywhere I looked –
in corners, behind furniture and even in the ceiling. Most were in a 
pitiful state, extremely thin and with lots of eye problems.’

The court heard the RSPCA visited the 
Fosters in February and March last year but were not allowed full 
access. 

Inspectors were told there were six to nine cats and the house 
was cleaned daily. But six months later police went to the house on an 
unrelated matter and alerted the RSPCA to the true scale of the problem.

Thirteen of the cats were so ill as a result of the neglect they suffered that they had to be put down

The large number of cats is a result of breeding that got out of control and the Fosters' inability to pay for vets' bills

Rebecca Plant, defending the Fosters, 
said being prosecuted was a ‘relief’ for the pair, who spent £200 a week
from their benefits on cat food.

She said that they tried to get as 
many of the animals neutered as they could but had run up debts in their
own names and then used other names at vets to avoid fees they could 
not afford.

Miss Plant added: ‘The house was cleaned from top to bottom daily.’

She said the cats were kept inside all
the time and the Fosters led ‘a reclusive existence’ because they 
feared they would lose their home if the situation became known.

The pair, from Leicester, were banned 
from keeping any animal for ten years and were each sentenced to 12 
weeks in prison, suspended for 12 months, as well as being ordered to 
pay £500 costs.

Many of the cats had to have eyes removed when they became infected as a result of fighting

Kara Foster must also carry out 160 hours of unpaid work in the community.

Miss Plant added: ‘This gives them the opportunity to sort their lives out after all this time of having to hide.

‘The RSPCA and council have been very supportive. Neither defendant intends to have cats again.’
