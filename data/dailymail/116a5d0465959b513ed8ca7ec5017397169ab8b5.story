A pensioner was killed when a police van believed to have been parked with its handbrake off rolled down a slope and hit him.

Witnesses said Donald Bennett, 83, was unable to jump to safety because he had recently had an operation and relied on two sticks to walk.

The tragedy happened when two officers were called to deal with a disturbance at a park where Mr Bennett was sitting on a wall eating ice cream.

They parked their two-tonne Ford 
Transit at the top of a slope, but appear to have left the handbrake off
 when they went to investigate the incident involving youths.

The van then rolled forward and crushed the great-grandfather. Paramedics were called, but he died of his injuries.

The accident, which happened in 
Pudsey, West Yorkshire, on Saturday afternoon, has been referred to the 
Independent Police Complaints Commission.

Floral tributes have been left at the scene where Donald Bennett died in Pudsey Park

Mr Bennett, a retired joiner who 
lived nearby with his wife Marjorie, 83, had been driven by his son to 
enjoy the sunshine in Pudsey Park, which was packed with families.

Floral tributes from his family, 
including Mr Bennett's grandchildren, mark the spot close to the park 
gates where the pensioner was killed.

Richard
 Brook, who lives a few streets from Mr Bennett's home and was in the 
park today, said the community was stunned and saddened by his death.

'We heard about it on Saturday night,' he said. 'We were shocked, especially for it to happen in a park like this.

'He was actually watching the bowls with his son and he came up here to this end of the park for an ice cream, as far as I know.

'I'd see him walking around near his home and he seemed like a nice bloke.

'I can't see how this could have happened.'

Mrs Bennett was being consoled at 
home yesterday by relatives. A family member, who asked not to be named,
 said: ‘It is all very shocking and sad. He was a loving grandfather.’

Dog walker Barry Smith described what
 happened after the PC and WPC arrived in their van. ‘They jumped out to
 go and speak to the young lads who were being a nuisance and they left 
the handbrake off,’ he said.

Two police officers had been called to the scene after complaints of youths in the area

‘The van rolled forward and crushed Mr Bennett to death.

‘He couldn’t move because he needed two walking sticks to get around because he’d just come out of hospital after an operation.’

Last night neighbours said Mr Bennett
 was well known locally and was affectionately called ‘Donald Duck’ by 
children in the area.

‘Donald was such a lovely man, and 
would always go the extra mile for anyone despite his age,’ said one, 
who asked not to be named.

‘He loved going out on walks – he was always smiling.

‘He used to stop and talk to children around here when they were with their parents and childminders.

‘When the news filtered through, it deeply shocked everybody. We’re all saddened and stunned.’

In a statement, the IPCC said: 'The force referred the incident, which happened on Saturday at about 2.15pm to the IPCC and an IPCC investigator was sent to the scene.

'An independent IPCC investigation was launched shortly afterwards.'
