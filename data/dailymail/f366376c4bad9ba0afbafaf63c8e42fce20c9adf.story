With a home Olympics fast approaching, not to mention a £200million budget, you would expect a Government agency to be able to have a sizeable impact on the number of us playing sport.

And Sport England can certainly claim to have made a difference to participation in a huge variety of sports, from football to judo.

The only problem is that the effect appears to have been a largely negative one, it emerged yesterday.

Less of a splash: The number of swimmers has shrunk from 3.25m to 2.81m since 2007

Out of play: The amount of people playing football, our second most popular sport, in this country has also reduced from 2.12m from 2.14m

Analysis of 28 major sports targeted by Sport England shows that public participation has fallen over the past four years in 19, remained constant in five and risen in only four.

The survey of 166,000 people by the agency, which funds grass-roots sport, examined the number of adults participating in at least half an hour of moderate exercise in each of the various sports. It found major falls in participation in some of Britain’s most popular sports including swimming, football and tennis.

Between 2007 and 2011, there was a steep fall in the number of people going swimming – the country’s most popular sport – from 3.25million to 2.81million.

In the same period, the number of us playing football dropped from 2.14million to 2.12million and tennis fell from 487,500 to 375,800.Golf sank from 948,300 to 833,200.

Other sports in decline were: badminton, horse-riding, bowls, basketball, snow sports, hockey, weightlifting, sailing, rugby league, rugby union, rowing, gymnastics, volleyball, rounders and judo.

Only four sports showed  increases: boxing, table tennis, mountaineering and athletics, which includes jogging. Participation in athletics increased from 1.6million to 1.8million.

On the rise: Table tennis was one of few sports to see an increase in numbers, thanks perhaps to its celebrity endorsement earlier this year

Climbing numbers: Mountaineering was one of only four sports, along with table tennis, athletics and boxing, to see an increase in participation

Cycling, squash, netball, canoeing  and fencing showed no change.

Among 18-year-olds, a key group being targeted by Sport England, the numbers taking part in sport overall fell from 189,100 in 2007/8 to 172,500 in 2010/11. Sport England has an annual budget of over £200million to promote grass-roots sport, with around half channelled through sports governing bodies.

The agency said ‘economic factors’ were partly behind the trend as people were spending less money on recreation. It said severe winter weather last year had also deterred people from outdoor sport.

But the figures are worrying given that the outlay on hosting the Olympics in London next year was supposed to benefit the nation by boosting public participation in sports and therefore the nation’s health.

Sport England’s chief executive Jennie Price – a barrister by training who previously headed the Government recycling body WRAP – said yesterday there could still be a boost from the Olympics.

She said: ‘It has not happened yet, but the Olympics was only ever an opportunity and we still have next year to come. I think when we get into the Olympic year we will see  an increase – I don’t see that the opportunity is lost. It was always more likely to have an effect around the Games and afterwards.’

Hugh Robertson, the Sports Minister, said: ‘Although not unexpected, these figures are  very disappointing.’

He added that the Government would be unveiling a new strategy to boost youth sport that will be announced in the new year, adding: ‘This strategy will be based on concrete results in return for Government investment and will ensure we create a real and lasting sports legacy after London’s Games.'
