South Somerset District Council has hired a security guard for its reception area after claims David Fuller (pictured) intimidated staff

A council has been forced to hire a £30,000-a-year security guard to protect staff from a single local resident who is 'intimidating' workers.

South Somerset District Council recruited the guard to sit in its reception five days a week to ensure David Fuller does not enter the building. 

Officials banned him from its premises in Yeovil, Somerset, in 2011 but claim he has broken the restriction a number of times.

Fuller has a previous public order conviction for erecting an offensive sign aimed at a council officer he has been in dispute with. 

Mark Williams, council chief executive, sent a letter in October last year which warned Mr Fuller his case would not be reviewed for another year after demonstrating a 'complete contempt' for the ban.

It said: 'Despite my earlier letter you have acted in a flagrant breach of this ban and accessed our offices by force.

'You behaved in a completely unacceptable and intimidating manner such that the police were called and you were subsequently arrested.

'The council is not going to be threatened from doing everything it can to protect its staff.'

It said the council had licence to prohibit entry by any person and added: 'If you ignore this letter we will take such steps as are necessary to enforce the ban.'

Instead the council said it would deal with any queries through Mr Fuller's wife Jo, landlady of a local pub, and who also manages around 180 tenants in properties in the council's area.

Yesterday Mr Fuller branded the decision 'unfair' and said it made running a business difficult.

He said: 'I've only ever visited to talk about queries and complaints. Now they won't speak to me on the phone and I can't go to the offices.

'When you have a concern you want it sorted straight away. Mrs Fuller is busy and it's a lot for her to have to deal with.'

He said it was a waste of public money which could be spent on improving and retaining council services instead.

He added: 'The offices are a public place, how can they ban someone from it? If I haven't committed an offence then I shouldn't be banned. I feel discriminated against.'

But Mr Fuller admitted previous disagreements he had with district council licensing officer Nigel Marston may have 'escalated the situation'.

The council banned Mr Fuller from coming to their offices (pictured) in 2011, but say he has violated the ban on several occasions. Mr Fuller has a previous conviction for erecting a sign aimed at a council officer

It is understood the guard was been hired specifically to prevent Mr Fuller entering the premises in Yeovil, Somerset, but the council has refused to confirm or deny this.

Private security companies in the area prodive guards for around £80-a-year, meaning the council could be spending £30,000-per-year on the officer.

It is believed the guard has been in the post for at least a month.

A spokesperson for the authority said: 'The council reviews security for our reception services periodically to ensure the safety of our visitors and staff working in customer services, and has concluded it warrants the presence of an Security Industry Authority qualified security officer at the present time.'

Earlier this month Fuller lost an appeal to have a conviction and sentence overturned after he was found guilty of causing a public order offence after making a sign attacking Mr Marston.

The court ruled he would now have to pay a larger fine for the crime.
