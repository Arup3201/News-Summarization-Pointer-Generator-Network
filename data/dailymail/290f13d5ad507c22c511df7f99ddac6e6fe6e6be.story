A former top aide to the woman at the center of the 'Bridgegate' scandal plaguing New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie denied under oath on Tuesday that she had anything to do with the fiasco swirling around Gov. Chris Christie.

The embattled governor is still contemplating a run for president in 2016, but must first weather the storm brought on when Bridget Kelly, then his deputy chief of staff, allegedly set into motion a week-long political plot in September 2013 to punish an unsupportive Democratic mayor by choking off traffic leading from his town to the iconic George Washington Bridge.

Christina Genovese Renna was Kelly's top aide and Christie's director of intergovernmental affairs.

'I had no knowledge of, or involvement in, the bridge lane closures,' she calmly told a special legislative panel on Tuesday.

Renna's role in the series of events that led to five resignations and firings was described in an investigative report commissioned by Christie – a document that created a mini firestorm of guffaws from Democrats even as it absolved the governor of wrongdoing.

Christina Renna testified Tuesday before a special investigative committee in the New Jersey legislature about the 'Bridgegate' controversy swirling around Gov. Chris Christie, denying any involvement in the political mess

Christie has insisted throughout that he was unaware of any plot involving the bridge until media reports started appearing.

The report from the law firm Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher placed the blame on Kelly and a Christie appointee to the powerful Port Authority named David Wildstein.

It also includes a summary of an interview Renna gave with attorneys.

According to that summary, a sobbing Kelly called Renna at work after the public release of an email in which Kelly wrote to Wildstein that it was 'time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee.'

'Kelly was hysterically crying and said that she was sorry,' the summary reads 'Renna asked Kelly if she was going to come into the office, and Kelly said no.'

'Kelly hung up and called Renna back at some point later in the day to ask Renna to log into Kelly’s Twitter and delete Kelly’s account, because people were tweeting "mean things" about Kelly.'

The special
 New Jersey investigative committee subpoenaed Renna months ago, along 
with mroe than two dozen other figures in the scandal. Its co-chair,

Democratic Assemblyman John Wisniewski, has said he won't rule out calling Gov. Christie to personally testify under oath.

He
 told the Associated Press that Christie's testimony, which would 
ratchet up the Bridgegate frenzy to new levels, is 'a possibility but 
not a certainty.'

Bridget Kelly, who was Christie's deputy chief of staff and Renna's boss, is likely one target of a criminal probe led by U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman -- who got his job succeeding Chris Christie after he won the governor's mansion

A parallel investigation by U.S. 
Attorney Paul Fishman – Christie's successor in that job – is reportedly
 seeking criminal indictments.

Wisniewski has insisted his committee will only call witnesses whose participation won't interfere with Fishman's probe.

Spooked: Former Port Authority Chairman David Samson has stopped cooperating with the investigative committee, complaining of leaks to the press following his delivery of documents to committee Democrats

Loretta Weinberg, a Democratic state senator who shares control of the committee with WIsniewski, told Bloomberg that Renna's testimony will be 'a point on the road of trying to find out all of the things that might have gone wrong here.'

'Not much in the administration operates outside of the governor’s hands,' she added, hinting that Christie himself is likely the Democrats' ultimate target.

The committee hearing Tuesday's subpoenaed testimony was constituted in January with a two-year charter, giving it jurisdiction until well into the 2016 presidential primary season.

Former Port Authority Chairman David Samson said Friday that he would stop cooperating with the panel, invoking his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination and refusing to turn over more documents.

He blamed the committee for 'bias' and 'violating its own rules of confidentiality' with a series of embarrassing media leaks.

Samson’s attorneys, Michael Chertoff and Angelo Genova, have complained that documents their cluient has already given the committee 'were discussed with the press, replete with criticism of our client and conclusory statements.'

Wisniewski noted in an interview with the Newark Star-Ledger that his committee is a legally constituted body and Samson himself is an attorney.

'It’s a significant step for a member of the state bar to refuse to cooperate with a lawful subpoena," Wisniewski said.

The bridge scandal has taken its toll on Christie, even bringing a barb from President Barack Obama during his humorous remarks at Saturday's annual White House Correspondents Association dinner.

'"Washington seems more dysfunctional than ever,' Obama said. 'Gridlock has gotten so bad in this town you have to wonder: What'd we do to piss off Chris Christie so bad?'
