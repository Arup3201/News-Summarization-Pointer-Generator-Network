Britain's first cloned dog was created by a firm headed by a disgraced South Korean Scientist who falsely claimed to have successfully cloned a human embryo and produced stem cells from it.

A 12-year-old dachshund called Winnie has become the first dog in Britain to be cloned, after owner Rebecca Smith won a contest held by a South Korean company - Sooam Biotech Research Foundation - with the purpose of publicising its cloning technique.

Sooam’s technology allowed a ‘mini-Winnie’ to be spawned, genetically identical to the original, but pupped by an unrelated animal.

The cloned puppy was born thanks to Sooam, a firm headed by Hwang Woo-suk (right). In 2010 a South Korean court sentenced him to 18 months in prison for embezzling research funds and illegally buying human eggs

But Sooam's Dr Hwang Woo-suk is currently serving a suspended prison term on criminal charges related to faked research.

In 2010 a South Korean court sentenced Hwang to 18 months in prison for embezzling research funds and illegally buying human eggs. But the court suspended the penalty.

The Supreme Court made that ruling final in February. He will stay free unless he breaks laws in the next two years.

Hwang scandalised the international 
scientific community in 2005 when his breakthrough human cloning 
research involving embryonic stem cells was found to have been faked.

Hwang later admitted the data was faked but claimed he had been deceived
 by a fellow researcher.

A piece of skin was taken from Winnie and transported to Seoul and a cell from that skin sample was placed inside a hollowed-out egg and electricity was used to spark fertilisation.

Then the embryo was implanted inside a mongrel dog that acted as a surrogate womb.

The cloned puppy was born via Caesarean on March 30, weighing just over 1lb.

It must spend the first six months of its life in quarantine before it can begin living with Rebecca.

In 2006, Dr Hwang was fired from his professorship at Seoul National University and in May that year was charged with fraud and embezzlement.

Hwang and his former colleagues created the world's first cloned dog, Snuppy, in 2005, and that achievement was independently confirmed.

After being stripped of the rights to conduct stem cell research due to the scandal, Hwang has been focusing on cloning dogs, coyotes and other animals, offering the £60,000 procedure as part of a competition.

Viewers of Channel 4’s documentary The £60,000 Puppy last night saw Rebecca, 30, and her family close to tears as they described how the original  Winnie’s affectionate personality and doggy optimism had helped them through a nightmare of mental illness.

‘Without Winnie I don’t know where you’d be,’ Rebecca’s mother told her earnestly. ‘Winnie has saved you.’

The dachshund was an 18th birthday present for Rebecca, at a time when she was ‘having lots of demons’. The pet helped her overcome the eating disorder she had struggled with for years.

Now, with their beloved Winnie elderly and arthritic, the Smiths faced a sorrowful  parting that confronts all dog-lovers. ‘She’s very special, but she’s not going to be around for ever,’ said Rebecca, a caterer in London.

Rebecca cannot bear to imagine a life without her canine friend. ‘When Winnie dies, I’ll have to move, because every time I go for a walk I’ll think of her, and I honestly won’t be able to cope,’ she said. ‘I just love her so much, I really do.’

Millions will understand — but many would recoil from the concept of manufacturing a genetic copy.

For one thing, there is the cost. Sooam Biotech justifies the colossal price-tag by pointing to the multi-millions spent on developing the technology.

Experts emphasise the fact that cloning cannot revive a dead pet.

The new animal might look identical, but it will have different experiences, perhaps even a different personality.

The Kennel Club said it was  ‘genuinely shocked’ by Sooam’s contest, and added that there is little guarantee ‘mini Winnie’ will resemble her namesake in anything but looks.

Original dachshund Winnie, who was cloned, was originally a present for Rebecca Smith, who suffered from bulimia

Professor Robin Lovell-Badge, an expert in genetics at the National Institute For Medical Research in London, said: ‘I see no valid justification for cloning pets.

‘It is a ridiculous waste of money and hope as well as being ethically very dubious.’

The technology that makes cloning possible first hit the headlines almost 20 years ago.

Dolly the sheep was created by scientists at Edinburgh University in 1996, but was plagued by health problems and put down at the relatively young age of six.

The biologist who cloned Dolly, Sir Ian Wilmut, said he did not believe cloned animals automatically inherited the character of the original — the essence that had made them so loved in the first place — and warned that owners could be disappointed.

Rebecca chose to clone her dog because of the irreplaceable bond she had to the original hound who saw her through so much of her life

The only thing that Ms Smith is unsure about is the temperament and personality of her dog-clone, and she'll have to wait for her pup to grow up to be able to tell
