ABC News has beaten its long-time rival NBC News in one of the top viewer demographics for the first time in almost four years.

The ratings grab by ABC comes months after the network's morning show beat The Today Show for the first time in 16 years.

Though the battle between Good Morning America and The Today Show has involved a well-documented round of musical chairs among the Today Show, the evening news win marks a big win for Diane Sawyer.

The journalist has anchored ABC's World News since 2009 and the show's ratings last week were just reported today.

During the week of July 14, ABC won the ratings race among viewers aged 25 to 54 years old on both Monday and Tuesday.

ABC took 2.009 million viewers to NBC's 1.972 million on Monday and continued their streak by pulling 1.891 million on Tuesday as compared to NBC's 1.820 million that same evening.

That said, NBC Nightly News still 'won' the 25-54 demographic, which is coveted among advertisers, on average for the week.

Deadline reports that this was the first time that ABC's evening news program beat its NBC counterpart in three years and 10 months.

Aside from being a point of pride for Sawyer, the boost in the networks ratings is a massive sales factor for ABC's advertising team.

While this past week gave two tangible dates of record-breaking ratings, it has been a growing trend.

ABC World News has cut the average gap that separated them from NBC by double digits for the past five weeks.

That gap was cut by a whopping 40 per cent last week, Deadline reports.

One play that ABC is making in an effort to keep the rates up is to go heavy on their detailed coverage of the birth of the Royal baby.

Both NBC and ABC have cut into their regularly scheduled programming throughout Monday and Tuesday, and they will air competing special programs on Tuesday night.
