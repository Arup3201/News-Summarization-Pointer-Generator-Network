Clare Townsend, who had a gun held to her head by Michael Wheatley

A terrified woman victim of a fugitive armed robber known as the 'Skull Cracker' lashed out at officials last night for putting him in an open jail as he was prepared for release.

As police urged the public not to approach Michael Wheatley, the Government ordered an urgent inquiry into why he failed to return to Standford Hill in Kent.

The 55-year-old – handed 13 life sentences at the Old Bailey in 2002 – earned his nickname by pistol-whipping his victims.

Sentencing Wheatley to life with a minimum of eight years, Judge Michael Mettyear told him that some of his victims 'may never fully recover'.

But he was temporarily allowed out of the Isle of Sheppey prison as the authorities prepared to release him.

One of Wheatley's victims Clare Townsend, 70, said she was 'shocked' to find he was in an open prison and said he is almost certain to rob again.

The retired headteacher said she will never forget the day he held a gun to her temple while holding up a branch of the Halifax bank in Raynes Park, South West London.

'Having been on the end of his violence, I would not have thought he was the sort of person that should be in an open prison,' she said.

'I thought he had escaped from an ordinary prison. When I realised he was in an open prison and he had permission to be out, I was very shocked.'

Recalling her ordeal at Wheatley's hands, the retired headteacher said: 'Suddenly he swung round, grabbed me by the neck, put a gun to my temple and started screaming at the cashiers.

'In that instant I thought he was going to kill me, because he just seemed so angry. It was almost as though I had personally done something and if he didn't get his money, I would personally be thwarting him.

'He was an extremely frightening and threatening, character. I know they [the police] felt he was an exceedingly dangerous person.

'That's why it's astonishing that all 
their hardwork in arresting him and sentencing him appropriately has 
somewhat been lost by allowing him to go to an open prison.'

Wheatley
 raided 13 building societies and banks over ten months in 2001 and 2002
 while on parole from a previous lengthy sentence.

His
 targets were mainly small branches in areas he knew, ranging from 
Southampton to Royston in Hertfordshire, and his crimes netted him more 
than £45,000.

As the robberies continued, the violence he used grew. In March 2002 he pistol-whipped a woman of 73 and a building society manager.

Wheatley was under the Release on Temporary Licence scheme, given to inmates who are being prepared for freedom.

His escape comes amid alarm at the rising number of dangerous criminals being switched to open jails.

Inmates are absconding from open jails at a rate of one every other day, according to shocking figures.

More than 580 criminals – including a string of killers – simply walked out or failed to return from day release between May 2010 and March 2013.

The worst year for murderers fleeing open prisons under the current government was 2010-11, when 17 disappeared.

Eight went in 2011/12 and nine the next year. Eighteen convicts who fled since May 2010 are still missing, according to figures released to MPs.

More than 1,240 serving life – or undefined terms – were moved in 2013. This compares to 393 in 2009.

Last night Prisons Minister Jeremy Wright said inmates will be forced to wear electronic tags. He said: 'We are not prepared to see public safety compromised, the system has been too lax up to now.

'In future when prisoners are let out on temporary licence they will be tagged, more strictly risk assessed and tested in the community under strict conditions.'

Tory backbencher Philip Davies said whoever allowed Wheatley out of prison was 'a berk' and should be sacked. He added: 'It is completely ludicrous that a serving life sentence prisoner is even in an open prison. The top priority should be the protection of the public.'

A Prison Service spokesman said: 'This is now a matter for the police.'

A Kent Police spokesman said: 'Anyone with any information or who sees Wheatley is asked to not approach him and to instead contact police.'
