Palmer United Party Senator Jacqui Lambie has proposed 'M.A.S.H-style' units to fight the Ebola threat, despite specialised medical response teams already existing in Australia, saying that the Federal government has not responded appropriately to the outbreak.

Senator Lambie has announced a five point 'action plan' to fight the deadly virus, which has killed thousands in Africa and has started infiltrating Western countries, 'in order to restore confidence and public trust' in the government.

'Mr Abbott has bungled the response to the Ebola threat from the start and is guilty of being complacent,' said Senator Lambie. 

'If any public hysteria or panic develops, it will be because the average Australian has found that the Abbott government has been untrustworthy and dysfunctional in their management of this serious and unprecedented threat to our public health.'

Senator Lambie has called for MASH style units to fight the Ebola threat

The Ebola virus could infect 10,000 people a week by the end of the year, according to the World Health Organisation

The American TV show series M*A*S*H popularised the work of Mobile Army Surgical Hospital workers

The plan includes making travel to and from all African countries illegal, and boosting custom's resources to install thermal imaging at airports to ensure that all overseas arrivals are scanned for symptoms of Ebola.

The points also include establishing quarantine facilities and dedicated Ebola treatment areas, and establishing a medical research unit for Ebola and other deadly diseases to engage in and contribute to world research.

The outspoken Tasmanian senator has further proposed establishing specialist medical teams in conjunction with the Australian Defense Force capable of domestic and international deployment, which she said will be 'similar in organisational structure to MASH teams of Vietnam era'.

These suggestions have been deemed unfounded by a senior doctor, who notes that such teams already exist in Australia.

Dr Steve Parnis, the Vice President of the Australian Medical Association, told Daily Mail Australia there was no need for them to be implemented.

'We have those teams. They're called AUSMAT teams,' he said. 

'These are civilian teams, doctors, nurses, people with logistical expertise.

'The question is whether the existing services will be deployed by government and whether they have the manpower.' 

The work of Mobile Army Surgical Hospitals were popularised in the early 1970's by the airing of US television series M*A*S*H, which ran for 11 years.

The series, though set during the Korean War, commented on conditions and actions from the Korean War and while often viewed as an unconventional sitcom, often raised the role of the US as both war-maker and peacemaker.

The show centered around the work of Hawkeye (Alan Alder), Father Mulcahy (William Christopher), Margaret 'Hot Lips' Houlihan (Loretta Swit), and Maxwell Q. Klinger (Jamie Farr).

Australia's equivalent to the Mobile Hospitals,AUSMAT, is based in Darwin and consists of doctors, nurses, firefighters and allied health staff.  

AUSMAT teams have been involved in responding to many natural disasters and international crisis,  including deployment to the Philippines when Typhoon Haiyan struck in November 2013.

'There's certainly no need to set up anything new,' Dr Parnis said, adding that Australia has good public health resources.   

A spokesman for Senator Lambie disagreed, saying there was a need for a specific Ebola unit for volunteer medical professionals.

'You don't want to degrade the other resources you have for natural disasters, because obviously, these are going to have to be specialist teams,' he said.  

Health Minister Peter Dutton tried to tamp down fears Ebola would reach Australia on Friday, saying the nation remains at very low risk. 

Earlier this week the World Health Organisation warned infections from the deadly virus could hit 10,000 infections a week by the end of the year. 

The ABC reported the government has been screening passengers from West Africa since August.   

Senator Lambie's plan also proposed banning travel from Ebola-stricken countries and for thermal imaging to be installed at airports.
