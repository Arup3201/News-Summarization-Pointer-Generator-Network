A sheriff has defended a police officer who stopped a black man who was walking with his hands in his pockets in snowy Michigan, saying he acted appropriately and the force has 'nothing to hide'.

Brandon McKean, 25, was approached by the white deputy in Pontiac, Oakland, on Thanksgiving afternoon following a 911 call in which he was accused of 'making people nervous'.

With his green hood up, he pulled out his cellphone and started filming the encounter, before posting the video online. It was later viewed and criticized by millions of people across the US.

In the footage, McKean can be heard asking the unidentified officer: 'Wow, walking by, having your hands in your pockets makes people nervous to call the police, when it's snowing outside?'

Defense: Oakland County Sheriff, Mike Bouchard (pictured), has defended his officer's actions, pointing out that McKean edited his cellphone video before posting it, and therefore it did not show the real story

He adds: 'There's 10,000 people in Pontiac right now with their hands in their pockets', to which the officer replies  there has been 'a lot of robberies' in the area and he must inspect 'unusual conduct'.

The footage of the incident - also videoed by the deputy at the time - led many to accuse the police of racial profiling, particularly in the wake of black 18-year-old Michael Brown's shooting death.

But now, Oakland County Sheriff, Mike Bouchard, has defended his officer's actions, pointing out that McKean edited the video before posting it, and therefore it did not show the real story.

In a Facebook post, he released the deputy's video of the events, in which the officer explains to McKean that the 911 call was made by the owner of local firm which had been robbed seven times. 

Alongside the video, Mr Bouchard's sheriff's office wrote: 'The caller and his employees were concerned about an individual who had walked by the front window of the business five or six times, while looking inside with his hands in his pockets.

Encounter: He adds: 'There's 10,000 people in Pontiac right now with their hands in their pockets', to which the officer replies there has been 'a lot of robberies' in the area and he must inspect 'unusual conduct'

'Fearing for their safety, the business dialed 911 and the deputy responded. In the unedited version of the event, the individual stated that if he had called the police on a suspicious person, he would expect the police to respond, check the area, and talk to the suspicious person being called about.'

The post concluded: 'The Deputy did not detain or pat down the individual and considering the nature of the call responded in a very restrained and professional manner.'

Mr Bouchard explained that the potential robbery suspect was wearing a green hoodie and a black jacket that matched the description of what McKean was donning in the officer's phone video.

Speaking to ABC 7, he added that the officer had probable cause to make the stop, treated McKean with respect and could even have gone further that he did by patting him down and asking for ID. 

'We have nothing to hide when we do our job,' he said.

However, McKean told the Huffington Post he was not wearing the same clothing as the suspect and was walking home in freezing temperatures when he was 'singled out' by the police officer.

In McKean's footage, the officer can be heard asking him: 'Am I inconveniencing you?'. McKean replies that he is pleased he is capturing the incident on camera, to which the deputy says: 'Me too.'

McKean then makes reference to the  protests over alleged police racism that are sweeping the US after a grand jury's decision not to indict officer Darren Wilson for shooting Brown on August 9.

Before being told he is free to leave the scene, he retorts: 'Because of the whole police situation going on across the country this is outrageous.'
