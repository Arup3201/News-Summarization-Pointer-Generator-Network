For generations, their loveable antics have brought joy to countless young viewers.

Now, some of Britain’s best-loved children’s TV characters are to be rewarded with a first-class honour – their own set of stamps.

The line-up of 12 favourites covers each decade since the 1950s.

The full line-up features Andy Pandy; Ivor the Engine; Dougal from the Magic Roundabout; Windy Miller from Camberwick Green; Mr Benn; Great Uncle Bulgaria from the Wombles; Paddington Bear; Bagpuss; Postman Pat; Bob the Builder; Peppa Pig; and Shaun the Sheep from the Wallace and Gromit series.

Some of Britain's best-loved children's TV characters are to be rewarded with a first-class honour - their own set of stamps.

2014 marks the 40th anniversary of Bagpuss's TV debut.

The saggy cloth cat is continually cited as one of the favourite British children's TV characters of all time.

The year will also mark the 50th anniversary of The Magic Roundabout, a show originally based on a French children's programme and later rebooted by the BBC.

Dougal, a dog and the main character in the show, was created by prolific British animator Ivor Wood, who went on to animate Paddington Bear and Postman Pat.

The characters were chosen because of their popularity and due to the fact that their shows are often repeated now, and some of them have even been reinvented.

This year will even see the films Postman Pat: The Movie and Paddington hit the big screen at cinemas nationwide.

And 2015 will see a return to television for The Wombles and a new CGI series giving them a hi-tech makeover.

Many of the shows, while aimed at a young audience, have gained a cult status and have devoted adult fans.

Such was the popularity of The Magic Roundabout that when it was moved to an earlier timeslot in 1967, the BBC received complaints from its adult fans who would not get home in time from work.

Andrew Hammond, from the Royal Mail 
Stamps department, said: 'For over 60 years, Britain's children's TV 
characters have brought cheer to generations of viewers.

'More
 importantly, it has presented us with a cast of characters that, like 
the memories of the programmes themselves, remains with us throughout 
our lives.

'It feels appropriate to celebrate all of these unforgettable characters on a set of very special stamps.'
