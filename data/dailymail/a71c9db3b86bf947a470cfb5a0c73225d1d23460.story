A doctor groped the bottoms of two teenage girls at a firework display on bonfire night last year, a court heard.

Anaesthetist Niaz Ahmed is said to have targeted the youngsters while he was working at a medical tent at the event, telling them ‘If you are looking for sex you have come to the right person’.

Newcastle Crown Court heard the 53-year-old had also boasted about the size of his penis, made thrusting motions with his pelvis and asked them to strip for him online.

Claims: Anaesthetist Niaz Ahmed is accused of groping two teenagers at a fireworks display last year

It is claimed Ahmed told the girls and their friends his sex life with his wife was poor and that he was able to satisfy a woman.

Prosecutors claim the doctor went on to simulate sex and rub himself against one girl, who was 16, and touch the upper legs of a 15-year-old.

Ahmed, of Cleadon, denies one charge of sexual assault and one of sexual activity with a child.

Prosecutor Michael Hodson told the court: 'This occurred on November 5 2011 at a fireworks display in South Shields.

'The two girls were there with their friends and the defendant was there associated with the safety tent, wearing a high-visibility jacket.'

The court heard the girls initially spoke to Ahmed because one of them thought she recognised him through his hospital role.

Mr Hodson added: 'They admitted they had entered into banter but the conversation got out of hand.

'They said the man had said despite his age he was very good sexually and could satisfy a woman as he had a large penis.

'He made thrusting movements with his pelvis.'

Ahmed agrees he had been involved in the 'banter' with the girls and their friends and said despite feeling uncomfortable decided to go along with their conversation, even after it was turned sexual by them.

He claims he was told the girls were older than their true age.

Mr Hodson said: 'The defendant said he was entering into the spirit of things and matching them as they bantered along, encouraged to do this by the other  people present.

'The crown will ask you whether a doctor did indeed participate in the banter and then try and push things too far.'

Ahmed denies the charges in a defence statement submitted to the court but Mr Hodson said the document 'raises some difficult questions' as the doctor admits he 'very briefly' touched both girls’ bottoms with playing along with the banter.

Mr Hodson added: 'It was the complainants, the defendant says, and others who made sexual remarks, not him, and the whole group was revelling in his uncomfortable state.

'Mr Ahmed said he was uncomfortable and did not know how to react to this situation and he decided to play along with he joke and very briefly touched each girl on the bottom.'

The trial continues.
