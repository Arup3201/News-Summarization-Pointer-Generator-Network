It is the largest private yacht ever built and is set to launch a new round of one-upmanship among the world's super-rich.

At 590ft, Azzam is 57ft longer than Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich's superyacht Eclipse.

The Chelsea owner's vessel had been the world's biggest yacht – until Azzam's launch in Germany yesterday.

For the playboy who has everything: Azzam the £400m superyacht blows everything else out of the water

Ownership of the £400million craft is 
shrouded in secrecy but it is rumoured to have been paid for by a member
 of the Saudi royal family, Alwaleed Bin Talal Alsaud.

Longer than 12 double-decker buses, 
not only is Azzam the biggest superyacht, it is also expected to be one 
of the fastest. The 94,000 horsepower vessel could reach speeds of more 
than 30 knots, or 35mph.

The size of superyachts has grown as 
billionaires compete to own the largest and its builders boast that 
Azzam, which means dedication in Arabic, is the 'most complex and 
challenging yacht that has ever been built'.

It was designed by Nauta Yachts and constructed in Bremen by Lurssen.

The firm's Peter Lurssen said: 'She truly represents another milestone in yachting history.'

Little is known about the interior of 
the yacht, which will require a staff of 50 and will be delivered to its
 owner later this year.

But it is likely to match the luxury 
of Abramovich's Eclipse, which features an armour-plated master suite, 
two swimming pools, two helipads, a hall, a cinema, a mini-submarine and
 even its own missile defence system.

No expense spared: New super-yacht Azzam has taken one year to design and three years to build

Abramovich has owned Eclipse, which is
 valued at £740million, since it was launched in 2010. It took the title
 of world's biggest private yacht from the 454ft Rising Sun, owned by 
American businessman Larry Ellison, which in turn took over from the 
414ft Octopus, owned by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen.

Prince Alwaleed, who is said to be 
worth around £10billion, already has Nabil, a yacht formerly owned by 
Saudi Arabian arms dealer Adnan Khashoggi, in his fleet.

If he is confirmed as the owner of Azzam, it will be the second time the 58-year-old has got the better of Abramovich.

The 46-year-old Russian was denied a 
berth at Antibes harbour on the French Riviera in 2011 as the prince had
 docked another of his yachts, the 265ft Kingdom 5KR, in the last 
remaining space.

Eclipse's crew pleaded for a berth but
 were eventually forced to drop anchor at sea and travel to the 
Russian's villa on a motorboat.

Azzam's design suggests it has been 
built for a buyer in the Middle East as it has about 50 suites but no 
large open spaces on deck, said TheYachtPhoto's Peter Seyfferth.

'I have never seen an Arab-owned yacht with big parties and girls round the pool like the Russians have,' he said.

'It is unlikely it will leave its dock very often. It is more of a question of prestige, to have the world's largest yacht.'

At 590.6ft long, Azzam is longer than 12 double-decker buses parked end-to-end.

At her widest point, known as the beam, Azzam measures 68.2ft, while her hull is 15.8ft deep.

She's heavier than Eclipse, too, with an estimated gross tonnage of 14,000GT - roughly equivalent to 1,750 adult African elephants.

Powered by two gas turbines and two diesel engines, she will boast an impressive 94,000 horsepower and a top speed in excess of 30 knots.

Azzam's fuel tank can hold one million litres and she will have a top speed of in excess of 30 knots.

It took the world's top engineers one 
year to design Azzam and three years to build her - but this is 
considered super-quick in ship-building terms.

The owner of Azzam is rumoured to be a member of the Saudi Royal Family, but the whole project is shrouded in secrecy.

Interior features will include a 29ft salon and a stunning, open-plan interior.

French interior designer Christophe 
Leoni was briefed to produce a sophisticated and yet timeless interior 
with a turn-of-the-century, Empire style.

Roman Abramovich's Eclipse is 533.1ft long and 72.2ft wide, and has an estimated gross tonnage of 13,500GT.

Eclipse, owned by Abramovich, has been revered by yachting enthusiasts for years on account of her size

She has four diesel engines and a 
maximum speed of 22 knots, which means Azzam will far outstrip her 
should the billionaire owners decide to have a race.

The yacht can accommodate 36 guests in
 comfort, and boasts a cinema, conference facilities, children's 
playroom, beauty salon, dance floor, swimming pool and sauna.

Built by Blohm +Voss Shipyards and 
designed inside and out by Terence Disdale, Eclipse was custom-made for 
the Chelsea oligarch in 2010.

Both ships are so huge, they would 
have trouble fitting into the majority of the world's marinas.  Only a 
handful, including Monaco and Antibes on the Riviera would be large 
enough to accommodate them.

However, despite Azzam eclipsing 
Eclipse today, neither of them comes close to the Titanic in terms of 
scale.  Built in 1912, the ill-fated Titanic was 882ft long and 92ft 
wide.
