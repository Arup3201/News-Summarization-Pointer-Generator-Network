Youth appeal: Rapper Fazer, a former member of N-Dubz, will be performing at the summer's BBC Proms

It is viewed by music-lovers  as the great annual showcase for the best of classical.

But this summer’s Proms has surprised fans by making a desperate bid to gain street cred.

For the 2013 programme will feature rap and punk amid the Elgar and Wagner, the BBC revealed yesterday.

The revelation led to the corporation being accused of dumbing down the eight-week festival.

The inclusion of rap for the first time is an attempt to attract a younger audience.

The Urban Classic Prom includes 
rappers Maverick Sabre and Fazer, as well as soul singer Laura Mvula, 
interspersed with pieces by modernist classical composers.

Another of the concerts, a 6 Music 
Prom put together by the radio station’s Steve Lamacq, includes 
performances from punk veterans The Stranglers and former Catatonia 
singer Cerys Matthews.

There will also be a Doctor Who Prom,
over two nights, including scenes from the sci-fi show with music 
written by its teenage fans.

While there are also many classical 
concerts in the season, the decision to include rappers and punk acts 
has dismayed many who feel the BBC has rendered the event ‘meaningless’ 
in its desperate attempt for ‘inclusiveness’.

Sir Roy Strong, former director of 
the Victoria & Albert Museum and the National Portrait Gallery, 
warned that the Proms was in danger of ‘lacking focus’.

Celebration: Some of Doctor Who's enemies, including the Daleks, will appear at the Royal Albert Hall as a special concert will celebrate the show's anniversary year

He added: ‘It comes out of the cult of accessibility and inclusiveness.

‘Nothing must be too difficult or if 
it is it must be altered. It becomes meaningless, doesn’t it. That is 
the danger…The thing is redefining its focus, it can end up losing it.’

The BBC website describes the Urban 
Classic Prom, which will be shown on BBC3 and broadcast on Radio 3, 
Radio 1 and 1 Extra, as ‘a dynamic meeting of musical cultures’ which 
will see the BBC Symphony Orchestra and conductor Jules Buckley team up 
with  ‘leading performers from the UK’s vibrant urban music scene’.

It adds that the ‘experimental 
fusion’ of musical styles will allow ‘high-octane orchestral showpieces’
to ‘rub shoulders with rap, R&B and soul’. The concert takes places
on Saturday, August 10 and tickets cost between £7.50 and £36

Mr Buckley said: ‘It’s a culture 
clash. We’re taking artists from different worlds and messing with their
music, putting it in an orchestral context and exploring it in a new 
way.’

Rapper Fazer was one third of the 
hip-hop group N-Dubz and used to date X Factor judge and former 
band-mate Tulisa Contostavlos. Maverick Sabre has been described as an 
Irish-English singer-songwriter and rapper.

Roger Wright, the BBC’s director of 
the Proms, said most of the concerts were still dedicated to the main 
classical repertoire. 

The Proms, which begin on July 12 and
run for two months, include a series of appearances by Nigel Kennedy 
and a complete performance of Wagner’s Ring Cycle, over four nights. 
There will also be gospel choirs, orchestras and soloists from around 
the world, music from the big screen and a performance of Stravinsky’s 
The Rite Of Spring.

Speaking about his band’s involvement
in the late night prom, The Stranglers’ bass guitarist Jean-Jacques 
Burnel, 61, said performing at the event was ‘as cool as it gets’.

Long-running: The Proms concerts began in 1895 and the BBC took over the running of the concerts in 1927

Flag-waving: As well as several nods to modern music, this year's Proms will still focus heavily on classical tunes and will still climax with the traditional Last Night of the Proms at the Royal Albert Hall
