A Detroit-area woman, a member of a select group of the living to have been born in the 19th century, is celebrating a birthday on Friday.

Her 115th.

Jeralean Talley, who was born May 23, 1899, went fishing last year and still gets around on her own with the help of a walker. She is the oldest living American in the United States.

The Inkster resident plans to celebrate with family and friends at a local church on Sunday.

On her actual birthday - Friday - Talley is going to the doctor for a checkup, although she says she doesn't feel sick.

But Talley's knees occasionally hurt, her right hand shakes, she has a hard time hearing and her memory comes and goes.

Her answer as to why she has lived so long hasn't changed over the years.

'It's all in the good Lord's hands,' Talley told the Detroit Free Press. 'There's nothing I can do about it.'

Talley is the oldest-living American and the second-oldest person in the world, according to a list maintained by the Gerontology Research Group, which tracks the world's longest-living people.

The Gerontology Research Group verified Talley's age using census data. Japan resident Misao Okawa, 116, tops the list.

Talley, born Jeralean Kurtz, was married to husband Alfred Talley for 52 years before his death in 1988 at age 95, Time reported last year.

Talley is cared for by a 76-year-old daughter who lives with her.

Five generations of the family are living in the area, including a great-great-grandson.
