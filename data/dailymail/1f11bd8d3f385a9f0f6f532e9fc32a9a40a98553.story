A British sports therapist raising money for charity has beaten the world record for the most marathons run in consecutive days after completing 53 in less than seven weeks.

Amy Hughes has finished the challenge after running 1388 miles in just 53 days to raise money for good causes. 

The 26-year-old from Oswestry, Shropshire, bypassed her original goal of beating the previous women's world record of 17 weeks ago to set a new precedent for both male and female runners.

Akinori Kusuda from Japan held the previous world record after running 52 marathons between January 30 and March March 22 in 2009.

Miss Hughes beat that record today after crossing the finish line in Manchester where she completed 

But while most would look forward to a hot bath and a lie-down, Miss Hughes said she'll miss getting up to take on a new marathon every day now that it's over. 

'In a strange way it is sad that it's all ending as I put so much time and effort in and I enjoyed it so much.

'We met everybody around the country and I'm really sad that it's at the end. I will enjoy a lie in though.' 

The sports therapist stuck to a regimented routine throughout the course of the challenge which began in Chester on August 6.

Waking up every morning at 6.30am in a different city, the team ate a hotel breakfast everyday before taking on another 26.2mile stretch. 

And even a stomach bug didn't stop the 26-year-old from pounding the pavements, with Miss Hughes completing her 35th marathon in Taunton, Somerset, while ill. 

Today Miss Hughes crossed the finish line in Manchester after 53 days of running. 

Her effort has raised more than £20,000 for the Isabelle Lottie Foundation, which helps with the early diagnosis of children with brain tumours, through an online donations page.

'The charity  is close to my heart because a friend's daughter was diagnosed with a brain tumour and it helps support families like hers,' said the fitness fanatic, who is now planning to take on more challenges in Europe. 

'One of my favourite parts has been meeting so many great people and having onlookers complete the marathons with me.

'Especially the ones who have never done one before, it was great.

'Everybody has been great. A lot of people have turned up to support us and lots of people have come out to run with us.

'The support has been great and really got me through.' 

Amy's quickest marathon was in Cambridge where she completed the 26.2 miles in four hours, 50 minutes.

Her slowest was in Taunton in a time of eight hours after she spent the night before with a stomach bug.

She averaged around five hours 20 minutes for each marathon she completed.
