Hennessy Gold Cup winner Many Clouds is to receive an unexpected entry in the 2015 Crabbie’s Grand National.

Trainer Oliver Sherwood confirmed owner Trevor Hemmings has requested that the seven-year-old be given the option of running in the Aintree marathon as well as the Cheltenham Gold Cup, which has been widely seen as his target.

Sherwood said that Many Clouds, who needs time between races, would only be able to run in one of the races.

Coral reacted to the news by inserting Many Clouds in their National betting at 33-1. Before that he is due to have his first run since his Hennessy victory in the Cotswold Chase at Cheltenham on January 24 or the Denman Chase at Newbury on February 7.

Sherwood said: ‘He was a tired horse after the Hennessy because he gives his all, but he recovered better than I anticipated. We backed off him after the Hennessy to build him back up to Cheltenham or Aintree.’

Sherwood’s novice chaser Puffin Billy, who took a crashing fall at Ascot’s Christmas meeting, could be set for a confidence-boosting run. The trainer said: ‘There is a chance we could give him a spin over hurdles after what happened.’

The seven-year-old was beaten over 60 lengths when last of four finishers behind Vibrato Valtat in the Wayward Lad Novices’ Chase at Kempton on December 27 and he has looked a pale shadow of the horse who, in 2011, won the Grade One Juvenile Hurdle at Punchestown and the International Hurdle.

Anthony Bromley, bloodstock advisor to owner Simon Munir, said: ‘He is too young to retire so he will be sent back to his original trainer to see if he can find the spark again.’
