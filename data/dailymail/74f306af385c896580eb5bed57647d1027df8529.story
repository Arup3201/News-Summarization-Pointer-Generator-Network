Charles Taylor lost his appeal against a war-crimes conviction today as judges confirmed a 50-year jail term against the former Liberian president.

The appeals chamber of the Special Court for Sierra Leone confirmed Taylor's conviction on 11 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity, including terrorism, murder, rape and using child soldiers.

That makes him the first former head of state convicted by an international court since Nuremberg trials of Nazi leaders after the Second World War.

He now faces spending the rest of his life behind bars, with the UK among the nations offering to hold the convicted war criminal.

If he is sent to Britain he is expected to be a 'category A' inmate suited only for a maximum security prison, with a cost to the British taxpayer of up to Â£80,000 a year.

The court's ruling today comes more than a decade after Taylor helped rebels go on a murderous rampage across war-torn Sierra Leone, raping, murdering and mutilating tens of thousands of innocent victims.

'Brutal violence': Presiding Judge George Gelaga King said Taylor had aided and abetted savage crimes committed by militants in Sierra Leone

Presiding Judge George Gelaga King said Taylor had aided and abetted crimes committed by Revolutionary United Front and Armed Forces Revolutionary Council rebels, while knowing well the kinds of crimes they were committing.

'Their primary purpose was to spread terror. Brutal violence was purposefully unleashed against civilians with the purpose of making them afraid, afraid that there would be more violence if they continued to resist,' he said.

'Governments and the international community were also afraid that unless the RUF and the AFRC demands were met, thousands more killings, mutilations, abductions and rapes of civilians would follow.'

Taylor, 65, dressed in a crisp suit, gold coloured tie, gold cufflinks and gold-rimmed lasses, sat impassively throughout the hour-long reading of the appeals judgment at the U.N.-backed court in The Hague.

The court found Taylor provided crucial aid to rebels in Sierra Leone during that country's 11-year civil war, which left an estimated 50,000 people dead before its conclusion in 2002.

Thousands more were left mutilated in a conflict that became known for its extreme cruelty, as rival rebel groups hacked off the limbs of their victims and carved their groups' initials into opponents.

The rebels developed gruesome terms for the mutilations, offering victims the choice of 'long sleeves' or 'short sleeves' - having their hands hacked off or their arms sliced off above the elbow.

Prosecutors said he used the proceeds from so-called blood diamonds mined in the conflict zone to finance Taylor's activities, which included advising and helping the rebels.

During Taylor's four-year initial trial, judges heard accounts from Sierra Leone civilians who had been mutilated by rebels or who had seen their close relatives murdered.

They also heard evidence from supermodel Naomi Campbell, who was questioned about blood diamonds Taylor was accused of having sent to her hotel room.

She described the objects she received as looking like 'dirty pebbles.'

In Sierra Leone's capital Freetown, victims were jubilant.

'It's a victory for me against tyranny,' said Edward Conteh, , who lost his lower left arm when rebels chopped it off with an axe. 'I'm happy Charles Taylor is behind bars for 50 years because I'm a victim of the war.'

'Impunity must stop in Africa, so I'm very happy over the decision,' he told the Associated Press. 'At 65, I don't know whether he will ever breathe the free air that I do breathe.'

Mr Conteh, who today leads an organisation that aids war amputees, said Taylor's sentence closed a chapter but that some 2,000 people still live with amputations and other serious injuries from the war. Many live in abject poverty with little means to support their families.

Taylor is the first former head of state convicted by an international war crimes court since the Second World War and Thursday's confirmation was welcomed as underscoring a new era of accountability for heads of state.

However, it also appeared to establish duelling sets of jurisprudence at two international courts on opposite sides of The Hague on the question of when senior officials can support one side in another country's civil war - an issue world leaders must consider if they mull over arming rebels in Syria.

The Sierra Leone appeals panel rejected a controversial February ruling by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), which said that to prove a leader has aided and abetted a crime, the assistance has to be specifically directed at committing a crime. In that case, the former chief of staff of the Yugoslav national army was acquitted of aiding and abetting atrocities by Bosnian Serb forces even though he had sent them arms and other supplies.

Taylor's case appeared to swing the pendulum back towards a lower burden of proof for prosecutors.

His lawyer complained that the two rulings have created 'entirely chaotic jurisprudence' at international tribunals.

If Taylor had been prosecuted by the Yugoslav tribunal 'I dare say the outcome would have been different, and that courthouse is less than 10 kilometres (six miles) away from this courthouse,' Morris Anyah said.

But international law expert Michael Scharf, of Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio, said the ruling 'righted the ship' after the Yugoslav court had made prosecuting leaders who support rebels much more difficult.

But Morris Anyah, Taylor's lead 
defence lawyer, complained that Taylor had been prosecuted because of a 
lack of friends in high places.

Referring
to the diplomatic row over action against the regime in Syria, Mr Anyah
said: 'But for two powerful nations, two members of the Security 
Council - Russia and China - Bashar Assad would have been charged and 
indicted by the International Criminal Court. That is not happening 
simply because of political reasons.

'Had
Charles Taylor had as friends any of the five permanent members of the 
Security Council ... this case I dare say would probably not have had 
the sort of traction it had.'

Because
Syria is not a member of the International Criminal Court, only the 
Security Council asking the court to investigate could trigger 
jurisdiction there.

And Taylor's supporters in Liberia remained loyal to the former warlord who was later democratically elected the country's president.

The very idea of international courts has come under fire across Africa. The ICC has been accused of neo-colonial meddling in Kenya as it pursues cases against its president and deputy president.

'This is complete international gangsterism,' said Cyril Allen, former secretary general of Liberia's National Patriotic Party. 'The ICC was set up for Africans, to intimidate them and get their resources.'

Taylor's brother-in-law Arthur Saye said he was not surprised by the verdict.

'From day one my position has been that the trial of Mr Taylor was orchestrated by the powers that be - the Western powers,' he told the Associated Press. 'This was an international conspiracy.'

Several African states are considering withdrawing from the ICC, which has only ever prosecuted Africans.
