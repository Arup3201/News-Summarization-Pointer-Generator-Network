Snorers who sleep more than nine hours a night are twice as likely to develop bowel cancer than snorers who get seven hours of sleep a night, according to new research.

The study showed a significant link between long periods of sleep and the development of colorectal cancer, especially among people who are overweight or who snore.

As a result, it is believed that obstructive sleep apnoea – the a form of snoring that causes interrupted breathing during sleep – could contribute to an increased risk of cancer.

According to the Harvard study, snoring isn't just annoying it poses serious risks to a person's health

This is because people with sleep apnoea snore and tend to sleep for longer because their sleep is disrupted, making them more tired.

‘Our current study adds to the very limited literature regarding the relationship between sleep duration, sleep quality and colorectal cancer risk,’ said lead author Dr Xuehong Zhang, of the Department of Medicine at Harvard Medical School.

‘The novel observation of increased risk among regular snorers who sleep for long periods raises the possibility that sleep apnoea and its intermittent [oxygen deprivation] may contribute to cancer risk.’

The researchers asked participants to estimate their total hours of sleep in a 24-hour period and asked them if they snore.

Of 76,368 women and 30,121 men the researchers documented a total of 1,973 cases of colorectal cancer.

They broke the participants into subgroups which showed that men and women who were overweight, or who were regular snorers, and who reported sleeping nine hours or more per day, had a 1.4 to 2-fold increased risk of developing colorectal cancer compared to overweight people, or snorers, who got seven hours sleep a day.

The general recommendation is that most adults should get about seven to eight hours of sleep a night.

The authors suggest that the association between long sleep duration and colorectal cancer may be explained by obstructive sleep apnoea, which involves repetitive episodes of complete or partial upper airway obstruction during sleep. 

Sleep apnoea, a dangerous form of snoring, causes tiredness which could explain why some snorers in the study slept too much

The most common cause of obstructive sleep apnoea is excess body weight, and loud snoring is a common symptom of the condition.

The researchers believe that sleep disruption caused by sleep apnoea may reduce sleep quality and increase sleepiness, resulting in longer reported sleep durations.

In addition to this, intermittent oxygen deprivation, similar to that which occurs in people with sleep apnoea, has been shown in animal models to promote tumour growth.

‘Future studies should focus on different populations and evaluate to see whether sleep duration and sleep quality is a novel risk factor for colorectal cancer and to understand the mechanisms behind this association,’ said Dr Zhang.

Other recent research has shown that people who sleep for less than six hours a night are at a significantly increased risk of stroke.

Researchers at the University of Alabama found that those in middle age who skimped on sleep were more likely to suffer stroke symptoms than those who got at least nine hours of shut-eye – even if they were a healthy weight and with no family history of stroke.

The scientists found that sleep apnea made the problem worse as it reduced the quality of people’s sleep.
