Two former Apple employees have revealed the gruelling work hours they endured at the technology company - including being on call 24 hours a day.

Former managers Don Melton and Nitin Ganatra have claimed they could only go to the toilet on Sunday nights while their manager watched The Sopranos and that every Sunday was a work night.

In a podcast interview with Debug, the pair discussed work habits at the American technology giant.

Apple's former internet technologies director, Don Melton, has revealed details about the gruelling work hours he endured while working for the technology company 

Apple's former internet technologies director Melton said Sunday nights became even worse after The Sopranos ended because they could no longer take a break.

'For a while there, you could count on the hour that The Sopranos was on that Scott [Forstall] wouldn't bug you because he was watching The Sopranos. And that was your reprieve. You could go to the bathroom, you could have a conversation with your family,' he said.

Melton described how his boss would work until 2am on a Sunday - while revealing that the new Apple CEO Tim Cook is just as dedicated.

'When you hear the so-called apocryphal stories about Tim Cook coming to work in the wee hours and staying late, it's not just some PR person telling you stories to make you think that Apple executives work really hard like that. They really do that. I mean, these people are nuts. They're just, they are there all the time,' he said.

Cook joined Apple in March 1998 as Senior Vice President (SVP) of Worldwide Operations and was named the CEO of Apple on August 24, 2011, when he succeeded Steve Jobs.

Six weeks later, on October 5, 2011, Jobs died due to complications from a relapse of his previously treated pancreatic cancer.

Melton has described Apple as 'like working in a nuclear power plant, but you don't get one of those protective suits.'

In his worrying analogy he said that if you didn't learn to survive it you would die.

Former director of iOS apps Ganatra conceded that the bosses were 'intense'.

'They're looking for the answers, you have the answer, and you cannot get the answer to them soon enough,' he said in agreement. 

A year after his retirement in 2012, Melton previously wrote on his own blog: 'It's not like other folks there weren't working nights and weekends too. Many of my engineers worked longer and harder than I did. It was a busy place. By our choice. But I don't miss any of the work.'

On September 19, Apple unveiled its iPhone 6 and Cook declared it was Apple's 'best launch ever'.

A record 10 million new iPhones were sold over the opening weekend, however buyers have since complained of problems with the bigger-screen handsets.
