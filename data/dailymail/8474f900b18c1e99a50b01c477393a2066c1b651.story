Tragedy: Five month pregnant Katherine Lynn Hoover 25, died after being shot in the head with a friend's revolver after they were admiring his gun collection

The father of the shooter, Don DeHayes told WTSP that his son accidentally pointed the pistol in her direction and the gun went off.

'We feel terrible about the whole thing,' said Don DeHayes.

While police have begun an investigation, neighbors reacted with skepticism about the incident.

'It's very hard to believe it was an accident, especially point blank in the temple, that's hard to understand,' said neighbor Josh Hady.

The weapon accidentally fired when it was being admired by the group of friends at around 6.45 pm.

Hoover was taken by ambulance to Bayfront Health Brooksville and from there was airlifted to Regional Medical Center Bayonet Point.

Once she was there, doctors operated and removed her baby slightly before 8pm, but tragically he was pronounced dead at just after 8.30pm

Officers from Hernando Sheriff's department have opened an investigation and have said that until that is completed they will not be releasing anymore information.

So far 
they have indicated that the shooting was accidental, however they have 
not revealed whether DeHayes will be charged with negligence.

According to the Tampa Bay Tribune, Carson Hoover is 'very distraught', said Gregory Stewart, whose daughter was once dating Hoover.

'I
 just got off the phone with him,' said Stewart. 'He is very upset and 
going through the range of emotions a normal person would. He’s not 
sleeping, very traumatized.'

'Carson
 is an all-around nice guy and a very good family man,” said Stewart. 
“He has two children now he still has to take care of. That will be 
difficult.'

Her brother, Gary Bryan, told The Tampa Bay Times that the entire family was in shock.

'What has happened is truly a tragic shock,” he said.

'My
 sister was a wonderful and special woman. She was a wonderful wife and 
mother. She had just gotten married and was getting herself 
established.'

Hoover is survived by Carson and her 6-year-old son, Nicholas.
