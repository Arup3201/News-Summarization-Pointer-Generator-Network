Ronaldinho has terminated his contract with Atletico Mineiro, and his representatives have said he will announce a new club within 24 hours.

His agent and brother, Roberto de Assis, revealed that the 34-year-old has no plans to retire and will host a press conference tomorrow with Atletico Mineiro's president, Alexandre Kalil.

De Assis said: 'He will play until he's 42. He will reveal his future destination on Wednesday.'

Boca Juniors have been suggested as his most likely destination. The Argentinian club are looking to replace club legend Juan Roman Riquelme, who, at the age of 36, has moved to Argentinos Juniors.

Ronaldinho enjoyed a fruitful two years with the Brazilian side. Many feared the former Ballon d'Or winner's career was over after he left AC Milan but he has since won the Copa Libertadores and Brazilian league.

Atletico Mineiro's manager, Levir Culpi, admitted he was disappointed to lose the former PSG, Barcelona and Milan forward.

He told SporTV: 'I can't call on Ronaldinho anymore. His cycle with us has ended.

'It's unfortunate because he's an idol to all of us. Everyone loves his football, the way he plays and he's a very charismatic person.

'But that's the way it goes. He's leaving and we must move on without him.'
