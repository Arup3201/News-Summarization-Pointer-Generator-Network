Jailed: Spartakas Grachauskas, who once tried to steal an IRA bomb memorial, has been jailed for money laundering after taking part in an online scam

A career criminal who once tried to steal a memorial to child IRA bomb victims to sell for scrap metal has been jailed for his part in an online scam involving discounted 'Olimpic Cameras'.

Lithuanian Spartakas Grachauskas, 27, was part of a gang who conned customers into paying for cheap cameras they never received.

The gang advertised discounted 
cameras, via websites called Olimpic Cameras,Technologies Shop, and 
Lions Tech, but the online shops were set up so that card payments would deliberately fail.

Customers were then asked to make a bank transfer and the money was taken without the goods being provided to the customer.

Grachauskas has now been sentenced to 11 months 
imprisonment for money laundering, and one month for breaching bail 
conditions at Chester Crown Court.

In May 2012, Grachauskas was sentenced to
 18 weeks by Manchester Magistrates’ Court after attempting to steal a 
plaque that forms part of the River Of Life memorial in Warrington to 12-year-old
Tim Parry, and Johnathan Ball, aged three, who died in the 
February 1993 explosion.

He was caught in the act trying to prise off part of the River of Life water feature, on Bridge Street, Warrington, to sell as scrap metal.

Grachauskas has six previous convictions for eight offences in England, including a 10-month custodial sentence for burglary, and four previous convictions in Lithuania.

In sentencing the gang members earlier this month, Judge Roger Dutton said the group had tried to lie their way out of trouble.

He said: 'Each of you came to the UK, 
it seems from the evidence heard, none of you can speak a word of the 
language and are reliant on family.

Scam: The gang advertised discounted cameras, via websites called Olimpic Cameras,Technologies Shop, and Lions Tech, but the online shops were set up so that card payments would deliberately fail

'However, you knew what bank accounts to get, and how to play your part. The air of innocence you portrayed to the jury was clearly a facade. Each of you knew precisely what was going on.

'You were telling a cock and bull story that had probably been fed to you by those running this. The sad fact in this is that none of you realised how ridiculous those accounts were.

Grachauskas, of Orford, Warrington, allowed his own bank account to be used to launder  £4,307 from the illegal operation, the court heard.

Three other defendants - Lilija Gincman, 53, of Orford, Rita Jablonskaite, 37, from Stoke, and Aleksas Bagdonavicius, 52, from Crewe -
 were also found guilty of money laundering after they allowed their 
personal bank accounts to be used and were each given a one year prison 
sentence.

Judge Dutton 
said that in making their bank accounts available the Lithuanian 
nationals had allowed criminals to rip off residents ‘at arm’s length’.

Gang: Alexsas Bagdonavicius, 52, and Rita Jablonskaite, 37, were also convicted of money laundering

Father-of-one
 Grachauskas was not present for the trial in December, but admitted 
money laundering at what Judge Dutton called the ‘eleventh and three 
quarter hour’.

Lucy O’Gara, defending, said he failed to appear as he did not have money for transport.

'He was worried about supporting his family so he allowed his bank account to be used,' said Ms O’Gara.

Involvement: Judge Dutton said there was evidence to suggest  Lilija Gincman was more deeply involved in the fraud, with police finding a diary of passwords, contacts and account details at her home

'He says he was not aware of the larger scale of the operation.'

The
 court heard criminals behind the online fraud, that operated from June 
5 to December 1, 2012, are probably based in Lithuania and have 
not been caught.

Customers across Europe were conned with victims reported in Greece, Germany, France and Italy.

Gincman, a full time carer for her family who has no previous convictions, laundered £16,695.

Judge
 Dutton said there was evidence to suggest she was more deeply involved 
in the fraud, with police finding a diary of passwords, contacts and 
account details at her home.

The court accepted the defendants had been targeted by more ‘criminally sophisticated’ fraudsters.

Jablonskaite
 moved to the UK to work in a car wash in Crewe, but was made redundant,
 while Bagdonavicius works in a tomato plant in Middlewich, the court 
heard.

Judge Dutton said: 'It’s often said the internet has changed our lives immensely over the years.

'What
 it has also done is open up opportunities for unscrupulous criminals to
 exploit unsuspecting members of the public at arm’s length, who send 
money off to websites in the trusting expectation they will receive the 
goods which they have paid for.

Memorial: In May 2012, Grachauskas was sentenced to 18 weeks in prison after he attempted to steal a plaque that forms part of the River Of Life memorial in Warrington

Victims: Johnathan Ball, three, (left) and 12-year-old Tim Parry were killed in the explosion in February 1993

'In order to operate a criminal scam of this kind it requires criminals who are prepared to allow existing bank accounts to be used for money from the unsuspecting public to be channelled into these accounts and then, within days, the cash withdrawn and funnelled back to the criminal enterprise.

'This is the role you played. Without your co-operation, this fraud could not have succeeded. You were a highly necessary ingredient.'
