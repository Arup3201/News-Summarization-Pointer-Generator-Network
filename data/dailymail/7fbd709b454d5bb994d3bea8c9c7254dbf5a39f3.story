New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady has laughed off allegations that his team used illegal deflated footballs in their 45-7 thrashing of the Indianapolis Colts in the AFC Championship game on Sunday night. 

In a Monday morning radio interview with WEEI, Brady was still riding high on clinching his record sixth trip to the Super Bowl and refused to comment on the NFL's investigation of whether his team at doctored game balls so they were easier to catch and throw. 

'I think I’ve heard it all at this point,' he said today. 

'That’s the last of my worries. I don’t even respond to stuff like this.'

The NFL has confirmed it is investigating the case. Footage from the Fox Sports broadcast shows referees took at least one football out of play on Sunday night. They later turned over the ball to the NFL so officials could weigh it.

In the third quarter of Sunday night's game, referees took the Patriots' ball out of the game and replaced it with another. According to reports, the ball was taken in to be weighed

New scrutiny: Head coach Bill Belichick - who has lead the Patriots to six Super Bowls in 14 seasons - was fined $500,000 in 2007 for videotaping sideline coaches during a game

NBC blog Pro Football Talk reports that the league is examining several footballs from the game.  

The claims are especially damaging because the Patriots have already been caught cheating once before. In 2007, the NFL fined the team and head coach Bill Belichick for videotaping an opposing team's sideline coaches during a game. The practice, which is against the rules, gave Patriots coaches insight into the plays that the defense was about to make.  

Indianapolis columnist Bob Kravitz of WTHR TV has claimed a source has told him that NFL officials are investigating New England for ball tampering.

Officials reportedly took a ball out of play to check whether it weighed the league-required 12 and a half to 13 and a half pounds.

Kravitz tweeted: 'The NFL is investigating the possibility.'

If the Patriots are found to have been using deflated balls, they will likely be fined at least one draft pick.

The suggestion has promptly been dubbed 'deflate-gate.' 

The Colts have not responded to the claims. 

NFL rules require that each team bring 12 Wilson footballs to the game to be used by their own offense. The footballs are weighed and tested by officials prior to the game. 

In 2012, the University of Southern California Trojans were penalized and an assistant was fired after the team was caught playing with deflated footballs.

Brady and Belichick have built an incredible run at New England. In 14 seasons together, they have recorded only one losing record and missed the playoffs just three times

The Patriots are infamous for SpyGate which occurred before their fist Super Bowl in January 2002 - the team were accused of filming Rams' practices; pictured above, New England quarterback Tom Brady holds up the championship trophy following the AFC Championship game on Sunday 

Teams frequently vary the weight of their footballs - within league rules - to suit their quarterbacks and the conditions on the field.

Most NFL pundits agree that deflating footballs would not have given the Patriots so much of an advantage as to be the cause of the 38-pound thrashing that the team handed to the Colts on Sunday night.

And regardless of the outcome of any investigation, the result of the game is final. The Patriots will face the Seattle Seahawks in Super Bowl XLIX in Phoenix on February 1.

The Patriots are already one of the most despised teams in football - both because of their consistent, enviable success and previous allegations of cheating and misdeeds by coach Belichick. 

In addition to the 2007 'Spygate' scandal, the Patriots were accused of filming the St. Louis Rams practice prior to Super Bowl XXXVI in 2002 - a claim that was later found not to be true by the NFL. 

And just last week, the Ravens accused the team of deceit and trying to confuse officials.

Tom Brady threw for three touchdowns and LeGarrette Blount ran in three more to lead his team to their 45-7 victory over the Indianapolis Colts.

New England opened a 14-point lead in the first half and then ran away with the game, with three third-quarter touchdowns and another to start the fourth. 

That made it the second-most lopsided game in AFC championship history.

Brady completed 23 of 35 passes for 226 yards. Blount ran 30 times for 148 yards. 

Andrew Luck completed 12 of 33 passes for 126 yards with two interceptions for the Colts.

Earlier in the day the Seahawks confirmed their spot with a stunning comeback against Green Bay in the NFC championship game.  

Russell Wilson hit Jermaine Kearse for a 35-yard touchdown, just over three minutes into overtime to lift the Seattle Seahawks to an improbable 28-22 victory. The victory reduced Wilson to tears.
