More than a million  over-65s are still working –  double the number 20 years ago, official figures revealed yesterday.

Many stay in employment beyond the retirement age because they need the income,  while others enjoy their job too much to quit.

The figures, from the Office for National Statistics, show 1.03million people who are over state pension age are working – nearly one in ten. In 1992, the first year the ONS kept records, only 479,000 worked.

Rise: In the last two decades the number of over-65s in work has risen sharply from around 430,000 to more than 1million today

Row: David Cameron and Ed Miliband clashed in the Commons today over the unemployment figures, with the Labour leader (right) warning that living standards are falling

Experts predict the number will continue to rise. Life expectancy has increased dramatically in the past 40 years, allowing workers to delay their retirement.

Meanwhile pension values have plummeted and savings rates have hit rock bottom, meaning many cannot afford to retire. Others want to continue earning to help out their grown-up children.

And many older workers insist they enjoy the social interaction, challenge, mental stimulation and sense of achievement that they get from their job.

Joanne Segars, chief executive of the National Association of Pension Funds, said: ‘We are seeing big changes in the age profile of the typical workplace, and the process is far from over.

‘Workers are becoming more flexible about their retirement and the UK is moving away from a black-and-white model of being either a worker or a pensioner.

‘People are choosing to stay on at work for a few more years, or are working part-time. Unfortunately, many of these older workers would rather retire but find that they do not have the savings or pension to do so.

‘Uncertainty about the economy and historically low annuity rates are also prompting many of them to stay on the payroll for a bit longer.’

The trend is also fuelled by a change in the law allowing workers to stay in their jobs for as long as they want and not being forced out at 65, and the increase in the state pension age – to 66 for both men and women by 2020 – with further increases to follow.

Bumpy: The uncertain recovery continues with a small increase in the unemployment rate to 71.6 per cent, still down on the 73 per cent peak five years ago

Benefits: Dole claimants fell last month but the numbers are still much higher than the levels seen before the financial crash and subsequent recession

Dot Gibson, of the National 
Pensioners’ Convention, said: ‘This is just the latest evidence that 
older people are struggling to manage on their pensions and are often 
forced to carry on working as the only way to make ends meet.

The unemployment rate varies from 6.2 per cent in the South West of England to 10.1 per cent in the North East, the ONS said.

North East 131,000 unemployed (+4,000) unemployment rate 10.1%

North West 273,000 (-28,000) 7.9%

Yorkshire and the Humber 244,000 (-2,000) 8.9%

East Midlands 179,000 (+1,000) 7.8%

West Midlands 259,000 (+19,000) 9.4%

East of England 208,000 (+1,000) 6.7%

London 366,000 (+1,000) 8.5%

South East 297,000 (-2,000) 6.6%

South West 168,000 (+12,000) 6.2%

Wales 125,000 (-) 8.4%

Scotland 194,000 (-6,000) 7.1%

Northern Ireland 68,000 (-5,000) 7.8%

‘But the answer isn’t to keep people 
working when young people are struggling to find jobs.’

Malcolm McLean, 
of pensions advisers Barnett Waddingham, said the knock-on effect of the
growing number of older workers was ‘a matter of great concern’.

He warned: ‘Unless or until economic 
stimulus can provide many more jobs, today’s unemployed may well become 
the impoverished pensioners of the future.’

The ONS figures also showed UK 
unemployment fell by 5,000 between February and April to 2.51million, 
and there are a record number in work – 29.7million.

The percentage of the working-age 
population in employment is 71.5 per cent, compared with 50 per cent in 
Greece and 54 per cent in Spain.

Of the 432,000 extra jobs created in 
the past year, nearly two-thirds have gone to women, who make up nearly 
half the workforce – 13.8million.

The continuing financial squeeze 
means the number of stay-at-home mothers has dropped again, by 34,000 
between February and April.

Job vacancies are the highest since the 2008 banking crisis, at 516,000.

But Mark Beatson, chief economist at 
the Chartered Instituted of Personnel and Development, said businesses 
were struggling to find people with the right skills.

The number of private sector jobs has risen sharply since a low of 22.5million after the 2008 financial crash

Spending cuts and a renewed focus on creating private sector jobs has seen the number of people working for the state tumble from 6.3million to 5.7million
