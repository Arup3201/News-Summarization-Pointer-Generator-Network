A thief who was just 17 when he murdered a bed-ridden dementia sufferer as he burgled her flat has been jailed for a minimum of 18 years.

Margery Gilbey, 88, was found covered in blood at her sheltered accommodation in Shadwell, East London, after convicted thief Imran Douglas ransacked her room and left her to die.

He strangled the 'old-fashioned East Ender' and stabbed her in the neck in a crime described by a judge as 'wholly gratuitous'.

Thug: Imran Douglas, left, was just 17 when he murdered 'old-fashioned East Ender' Margery Gilbey, 88, right, at her home in Shadwell, East London. The Old Bailey heard he left her to die in her bed, covered in blood

The Old Bailey heard Douglas, who had been expelled from six schools and put in a children's home just six days earlier, went to Mrs Gilbey's flat on May 24 with the intention of killing her.

After fatally wounding her, Douglas rummaged through her drawers with blood on his hands.

When a nurse looked through the letterbox and saw him in the room, Douglas clambered over the balcony and escaped in a car waiting nearby.

Mrs Gilbey's son Alan, 55, from nearby Bethnal Green, visited with her favourite fish and chip supper just as staff were raising the alarm.

Together he and the care assistants found his mother already dead in her bed, covered in blood.

Known as Madge, the well-known former cafe cook had nursing care at the first-floor flat because she had dementia and difficulty walking on her own. In the last few years she had been almost entirely confined to her bed.

In an emotional tribute, her son said she the 'kindest most gentle person' who was liked by everyone she met.

The Sonali Gardens sheltered flats in Shadwell, East London, where Mrs Gilbey was murdered on May 24

He added: 'I can’t believe what has happened.

'She was a wonderful person and mother. She was very straightforward and kind - she had old-fashioned East End values.

'Everywhere she lived she was well-liked. The staff at the sheltered accommodation loved her and they have no blame for what happened. Now I just need to mourn. All this is just sinking in.'

He was not at court, saying it would have been too traumatic to look his mother's killer in the eye.

Douglas even made a reconnaissance trip to the flat the day before the murder, the court heard.

He
conned his way into the building pretending to be the grandson of a 
resident, then returned to his children's home in Bow, East London.

The next day he gained access in the same way and headed straight to Mrs Gilbey's flat.

Detectives identified him on CCTV and went to the children's home the same day.

There they found his clothes covered in blood in a laundry basket, and a bag on his bed which had the pensioner’s blood on it.

Douglas
initially denied murder, but changed his plea to guilty on the first 
day of his trial when faced with overwhelming evidence.

'Although I would clearly love to attend sentencing to see justice done for my mother, I cannot,' he said.

'If I were to see Imran Douglas in person, it would make him real to me.

'He would haunt me and I know those momentary flashes would be unbearable.'

Douglas, who turned 18 last month, had previously been granted anonymity because of his age.

He stared at the floor while he was sentenced, and as he was led away a family member of Mrs Gilbey shouted: 'I hope you rot, scum'.

The court heard social services failed to heed warnings from Douglas's own father that he was a danger.

Judge John Bevan QC told him: 'Clearly you have significant problems controlling your anger, and it is a tragedy that social services totally failed to have regard to the reality of the extreme danger you posed in May this year and will continue to pose in the future.

'It is in my judgement, and sadly, a crime at the top end of the scale of gravity.

'You used a knife to attack a defenceless and vulnerable old lady in the privacy of her own home, on premises you must have seen to be sheltered accommodation.

'You could have burgled her to her heart's content without doing what you did.

'It seems you were observed being driven away in a car but you lack the courage to name your accomplice.

'You rooted through her property after stabbing her, leaving her blood on her wardrobe.

'It was wholly gratuitous and, I fear, callous.'

The court heard Douglas still faces two outstanding charges of carrying a knife.

Detective Chief Inspector Graeme Gwyn said: 'Margery was killed as she lay in her own bed, in a place where she should have been safe. To see such violence used against a defenceless, elderly lady was truly shocking.

'Only Douglas can explain why an attempted burglary had to end in murder.

'I would like to pay testimony to Margery's family who have demonstrated incredible dignity throughout this difficult process.'
