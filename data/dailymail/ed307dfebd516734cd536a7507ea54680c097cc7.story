A father suffered E.coli poisoning on a Thomas Cook family holiday at a five-star Turkish hotel where hundreds of British tourists fell ill, lawyers said today.

Guests at the all-inclusive Sentido Perissia Hotel in Side, have been confined to their rooms because of a mass outbreak of sickness.

The father, who was on holiday with his wife and two children, had tests after returning to Britain which revealed he had contracted the E.coli virus. In extreme cases, the infection can kill.

The family paid £4,000 for their one-week stay at the luxury resort on the Turkish coast - but the man's wife and one of his children struck down by severe diarrhoea, stomach cramps and vomiting.

Lawyers said the man, who has not been identified, still has 'significant symptoms' nearly two weeks after returning home and he is yet to go back to work.

Thomas Cook said there has been an outbreak of norovirus at the hotel and the food and hygiene standards are not to blame.

They say that their own tests on 144 victims have shown the symptoms were caused by a virus and not a food borne pathogen like E.coli.

They also pointed out that none of the Dutch guests staying at the resort have been infected with the implication that the virus has simply been spread amongst the Brits who spent a lot of time around each other.

The holiday company have suspended holidays at the resort after guests fell ill.

Lawyers also claimed that another guest had been infected by Giardia - a parasite that has been found in the water.

Nolan Mortimer, a partner at Colemans CTTS solicitors, said they were representing a man who had E.coli.

'Three of the family of four fell ill while staying at the hotel. They have had stool samples taken in the UK and the father has been diagnosed with the E.coli infection,' he said.

'The weight of cases of illness from the hotel is indicative of a significant problem.

'It is difficult to say how many people have been affected but we are looking at dealing with 100 cases of sick people ourselves.'

Bacterial infections like E.coli can develop and spread rapidly if there is poor food preparation and hygiene standards.

Mr Mortimer is preparing claims for compensation against Thomas Cook.

Hundreds of holidaymakers are thought to have fallen ill at the luxury hotel over the last month.

Diane Blumsom, 45, from Clacton, Essex, was hospitalised in Turkey after being struck down by the illness.

She paid £1,300 to fly herself and her daughters Sian, 18, and nine-year-old Jane, home from their break early.

Miss Blumsom, who was on holiday with a party of 20 people, had paid £5,412 for her two-week break.

She said: ‘It really was the holiday from hell. Seven members of the group have been hospitalised over the last nine days.

Happier times: Jade Bundy, 22, left, and her boyfriend David Corran, 28, who fell ill two days after arriving at the Turkish resort. They eventually flew home early

‘This
place was meant to be a five-star resort but we all asked Thomas Cook 
to fly us home because we were so ill we couldn’t use the facilities, 
but they refused. 

‘We arrived on Saturday August 10 and within two days our party were being struck down by severe sickness. My daughter Jane, who is nine, had projectile vomiting so severe it was like something out of The Exorcist.

'At one point the staff decided they didn’t want the ambulance to keep coming to the hotel so they insisted that people had to get taxis there instead.’

Staff closed down the swimming pool for two days last week as they tried to deal with the outbreak of sickness and diarrhoea.

Guest David Corran, 28, who was also staying at the hotel with the party of 20, including his girlfriend Jade Bundy, 22, fell ill within two days of arriving at the hotel.

‘We have been trying to think what we might have eaten but we don’t know,’ he said. ‘It could have been the salad and some thought it might be the water they use to wash the salad.

Crisis talks: Sick guests hold a meeting at the hotel to discuss what course of action to take after falling ill

‘When we complained about falling ill the rep blamed it on the English and said we had too much sun.’

Thomas Cook have flown out hygiene experts to investigate and have been sending guests with bookings to different resorts.

Alastair Brass, Thomas Cook director of service and quality, said: 'We know how important holidays are to people and how upsetting it can be when you’re ill overseas.

'Sentido has put extra measures in place to minimise the spread, whilst we moved new arrivals to alternative hotels and immediately sent a UK hygiene expert to carry out comprehensive tests. 

'Results indicate the cause is "viral", not the hotel’s hygiene standards.  

'The Sentido Perissia is popular with British customers enjoying an excellent health and safety record and rates highly in customer satisfaction surveys.  

'We’re sorry guests have been unwell and our experienced resort team continue to support those still with the 24-48 hour symptoms.'

‘The health and well-being of our 
customers is our top priority and we take all reports of illness very 
seriously. We immediately arranged for an independent UK hygiene 
consultant to carry out a comprehensive review of the hotel and the 
cause is believed to be viral.

‘The hotel has put in place a number of preventative measures to minimise any further illness.

‘Our team in resort are providing assistance to our guests and we will continue to closely monitor the situation.’
