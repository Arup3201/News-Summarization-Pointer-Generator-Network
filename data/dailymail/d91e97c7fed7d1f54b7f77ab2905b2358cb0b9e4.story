Earlier this week on ABC’s Q&A, comedian Josh Thomas introduced politician Bob Katter to the gay hook-up app, Grindr – and it seems the Greens party was listening.

The Greens have begun advertising on Grindr, using geo-located ads to send targeted messages to members of the gay community in marginal seats.

Greens candidate, Sam Hibbins will use the app to send political messages to members of Melbourne’s Prahran electorate, living in the suburbs of Prahran, Windsor, South Yarra and St Kilda East, as the candidate campaigns ahead of the Victoria's state election in November.

‘This election we're using Grindr to reach voters in Prahran,' Mr Hibbins wrote on his Facebook page.

'We'll be using it to promote events, our support for equality and broader policies.'

Mr Hibbins believes that although he is the first to use the strategy in Australia, the idea will take off as a popular campaign approach. 

‘It might seem new and innovative now, but I suspect the other parties will also do it this election,' Hibbins explained in his Facbeook post.

‘Mind you, I don't think Denis Napthine or Daniel Andrews broached it when they addressed the Australian Christian Lobby,’ he added.

The first of the Greens’ ten Grindr ads is an invitation to South Yarra gay bar Exchange on Saturday night, to join Hibbins and Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young.

‘There might be a perception that the rainbow community supports us,' Mr Hibbins told SMH.

'We want to make sure of that, and being able to reach them effectively is very important for us.'

Hibbins says the smartphone app is a cheap and creative way to reach voters.

‘When the opportunity to advertise on Grindr came up we jumped on it. It was the way of being able to micro-target an audience that was really important,’ Mr Hibbins told SMH.

The Prahran seat is known as the ‘pink seat’ amongst politicians, as it is a hub for the gay community, with the latest census data showing 6.6 per cent of Prahran couples are same-sex. 

‘It’s fitting that the diverse, vibrant seat of Prahran is the only three way Green-Liberal-Labor marginal in Victoria,' Mr Hibbins wrote on his Facebook page.

The seat is currently held by Liberal Clem Newton-Brown by 4.7 per cent.  

Mr Hibbins says the seat is ‘winnable’ and his approach to the upcoming state election is a ‘grassroots people-powered campaign’, which includes door-knocking and a ‘Grease the Musical sing-a-long fundraiser’ 

The Labor candidate Neil Pharaoh is also an advocate for gay rights, as he himself is a young gay man.

Mr Pharaoh convened Rainbow Labor at a national level, an organisation which 'advocates internally for progressive LGBTI reform.'

Mr Hibbins says the seat is ‘winnable’ and has described his approach to the upcoming state election as a ‘grassroots people-powered campaign’, including door-knocking more than 6000 homes and a ‘Grease the Musical sing-a-long fundraiser’ for the party. 

Whilst it’s believed to be an Australian-first, Dutch and Irish politicians were the first to use Grindr to connect with voters.

Dutch politician Jan-Bert Vroege used the app to campaign in March this year.

He did not use pop up messages like Mr Hibbins however, rather transforming his own pre-existing Grindr account, changing his profile description to: ‘let’s have a date on March 19’ to promote a political event about gay issues.

Whilst it’s believed to be an Australian-first, Dutch and Irish politicians were the first to use Grindr to connect with voters.

The news comes after a heated exchange between north Queensland MP Bob Katter and homosexual comedian Josh Thomas about gay issues in politics, featured on Q & A on Monday.

Mr Katter admitted he hadn't discussed the subject of gay rights "in the last 7 years".

Mr Thomas held Mr Katter to account, pointing out the problems with Mr Katter's refusal to address gay issues. 

'You say that it's (mental health issues amongst the gay community) not a priority but you talk about it quite a bit, and when you do talk about it you say awful things,' began Mr Thomas.

'And then when you go out and deny the existence of homosexuals in North Queensland,' Mr Thomas continued.

'They exist, there's an app called Grindr, I'll put it on your phone' he told Mr Katter, who mimed taking notes with a pen.

Mr Thomas' impassioned argument was met with loud applause from the audience and an excited response from the Twitter community. 

'All you need to do (is) say you say you know what, I've said some things in the past, it was a mistake,' said Mr Thomas, telling Mr Katter how to move forward in a more positive manner.

'(You need to say) I understand now, it's (Mr Katter's comments) hurting people's mental health, it's part of the problem, not part of the solution. 

'I'm sorry, hooray for homosexuals, here's some glitter.'
