If you want to join the latest celebrity selfie trend, not only can you go make-up free, you can have messy hair too because nobody will be looking at your face. This season, the celebrity selfie is all about the nails.

In the last few weeks everyone from Beyonce, Lily Allen, Mel B, Jessie J, Kim Kardashian and Nicole Scherzinger has posted a 'nailfie'.

Some star talons are spectacularly bejeweled but the big trend among the nailfie posters is the nude look.

Lily Allen steals the 'nailfie' show with her blinged-up manicure

Mel B posted her eye-catching manicure ahead of Saturday night's X Factor and managed to straddle both styles by jazzing up her nude manicure with a bit of bling.

Her gem encrusted forefinger added some razzle-dazzle to the otherwise subtle look.

But one celebrity who definitely wasn't going for subtle is Lilly Allen, who posted her colourful, glitzy manicure on Instagram two days ago.

Sporting an uncharacteristically low-key look, Kim Kardashian 'nailfie' showed her rocking the nude nail look too.

In  a cute nod to her child and hubbie, she wore a ring on each finger spelling out 'North' and 'West'.

Never one to miss a trend, sister Kendell Jenner also posted a snap of her and sister Kylie's hands intertwined with the caption 'reunited'.

The celebrity 'nailfies' have also confirmed that pointy claws are definitely in. The scarier looking, it seems, the better.

Beyonce's 'nailfie' featured her pointy claws in a deep shade of plum. Whereas Jessie J opted for bright blood red.

So forget the face creams and the makeup - get preening those nails.
