An investigation has been launched into a private 'silicon party' after a transgender woman received silicone injections in her buttocks and died.

The 40-year-old victim, who has not been named, attended the party at an unknown location in Santa Ana, California, in December.

Corporal Anthony Bertagna from the Santa Ana Police Department confirmed that she had 'received some injections in the buttocks area for cosmetic reasons.'

Antonio Viramontes from the LGBT Center Orange County said there has been an alarming increase nationwide in the number of transgender women and men attending so-called silicone parties

But shortly afterwards, the woman started having complications, including respiratory difficulties and died on January 21. 

Santa Ana Police Department are now trying to track down anyone who may have attended the party to get more information, according to KTLA 5. 

The incident is just the latest in a spate of cases worldwide involving women who have died after receiving injections.

This month, a transgender woman who allegedly performed illegal cosmetic surgery on women's buttocks appeared in court.

Oneal Ron Morris, 22, is accused of leaving women disfigured after injecting them with  super glue, Fix-A-Flat and cement, at homes across Florida.

She is also facing a manslaughter charge after one of her 'patients' died following surgery.

Terrible toll for beauty and vanity: Brazilian TV presenter Andressa Urach, a runner up in Brazil's Miss BumBum revealed the terrible damage wreaked on her body by plastic surgery

And, recently, a former runner-up in Brazil's Miss BumBum competition revealed the terrible harm fillers had done to her body.

Andressa Urach, 27, spent a month in intensive care and feared she would lose her leg after fillers 'rotted' her muscles and had to be removed, triggering a life-threatening infection. 

Plastic surgeon Dr. Justin West told KTLA 5 health problems arise because there are many risks associated with these procedures.

'The big danger is silicone getting into the blood stream, and ultimately ending up in the lungs, the brain or the heart and ultimately causing death,' West said. 

Antonio Viramontes from the LGBT Center Orange County said that transgender women are being injected with silicone, airplane fuel and even dog urine  by people with no medical training.

'People are injecting a lot of unusual things into their bodies in order to achieve this higher standard of beauty,' he said.
