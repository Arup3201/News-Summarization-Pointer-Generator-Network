A 29-year-old terminal cancer sufferer who plans to take her life on November 1 revealed she hopes her husband remarries after she is gone.

In a video released on Wednesday, Brittany Maynard said she understands everyone has to grieve but she doesn't want Dan to spend the rest of his life 'just missing his wife'.

'My husband is such a lovely man,' she said. 'I want him to be happy, I want him to have a family.

'I want him to have a family': Brittany Maynard released a video on Wednesday in which she said she hopes her husband Dan  remarries and becomes a father after she takes her life, which she planned to do today

'I know that might sound weird but there's no part of me that wants him to live out the rest of his life just missing his wife.

'So I hope he moves on and becomes a father.'

Maynard has stage IV glioblastoma multiforme, an aggressive form of terminal brain cancer and in April doctors gave her just six months to live.

She was planning to end her life today but may delay the move because she still has 'enough joy'. 

The newlywed recently managed to tick visiting the Grand Canyon off her bucket list after previously announcing that it was one place she hoped to visit before she died.

On Friday, she had revealed on her website that she had managed to travel from her home in Oregon to Arizona with her husband, mother and stepfather 'thanks to the kindness of Americans around the country who came forward to make my "bucket list" dream come true'.

In her latest statement, a video produced by end-of-life choice advocacy group Compassion & Choices, she acknowledges that some people have been skeptical about her story.

'When people criticize me for not waiting longer, or, you know, whatever they've decided is best for me, it hurts,' she said, 'because really, I risk it every day, every day that I wake up.'

Maynard also revealed that her health has been deteriorating and described a recent 'terrifying' day when she had two seizures and found herself unable to say her husband's name.

'I think sometimes people look at me and they think. "Well you don't look as sick as you say you are," which hurts to hear, because when I'm having a seizure and I can't speak afterwards, I certainly feel as sick as I am,' she said. 

Maynard had previously said that she planned to take the medication she'd been prescribed on November 1 because she wanted to celebrate her husband's birthday on October 30. 

Now she says she's waiting to see how her symptoms progress, but her greatest fear is taking too long to make the choice.

'The worst thing that could happen to me is that I wait too long because I'm trying to seize each day,' she said, 'but I somehow have my autonomy taken away from me by my disease because of the nature of my cancer.'

She added, however, that she may delay taking her life.

‘I still feel good enough and I still have enough joy and I still laugh and smile with my family and friends enough that it doesn't seem like the right time right now,’ she said. 

‘But it will come, because I feel myself getting sicker. It's happening each week.’

She hopes to be surrounded by her husband, mother, stepfather and best friend when she does it.

After her recent visit to the Grand Canyon, Maynard had written on her website in glowing terms about the experience. 

'The Canyon was breathtakingly beautiful, and I was able to enjoy my time with the two things I love most: my family and nature,' she wrote. 

Images taken at the Canyon show her kissing her husband, Dan, and embracing her mother and stepfather, grins across their faces.

But just a day after the experience, she suffered her 'worst seizure thus far', which left her temporarily paralyzed and tired for the rest of the day.

'The seizure was a harsh reminder that my symptoms continue to worsen as the tumor runs its course,' she wrote.

She finished the post by saying she found meaning in her battle for other states to implement right-to-die laws, as Oregon and four other state already have. 

'My dream is that every terminally ill American has access to the choice to die on their own terms with dignity,' she wrote. 'Please take an active role to make this a reality.'

Maynard gained nationwide attention after she shared a heart-wrenching video that explained  why she was choosing to end her life at age 29 - while campaigning to expand right-to-die laws.

Debilitating: A scan shows the Glioblastoma multiforme that would claim her life slowly within 14 months

Brittany Maynard launched an online video campaign for Compassion & Choices, an end-of-life non-profit organization, to promote death-with-dignity laws, which currently exist in only five states. 

Washington, Oregon, Montana, Vermont and New Mexico  allow people to die on their own terms, but Maynard says it is not enough.

‘Right now it's a choice that's only available to some Americans, which is really unethical,’ she said. 

Working through her foundation, The Brittany Fund, Maynard wants other states, like California, New Jersey and Colorado, to consider passing laws that would allow people to make the ultimate choice - life or death.

Since Oregon lawmakers passed the Death with Dignity Act in 1997, more than 1,170 people have obtained prescriptions under the law, and fewer than half of them used them to end their lives. 

She explained that, after suffering intense headaches, she was diagnosed with a brain tumor in January and was initially given 10 years to live, which she said was devastating.

But in a scan a few months later, doctors told her the cancer had progressed to Glioblastoma multiforme - an aggressive tumor. 

Sufferers have a life expectancy of around 14 months.

When she learned that she would die painfully and slowly, she decided to move from her home in California to Oregon, which has a 'Death with Dignity Act'. 

After releasing her video, critics lambasted her as selfish, but in an interview with CBS she said she was suffered immense pain - and wished she didn't have to be making the decision. 

Maynard said her biggest regret is that she will never get to have a family.

'I'd say most of my sadness centers around how much I wanted a family,' Maynard told CBS This Morning.

'And it feels like for me, that was always, like, how you created a legacy was, like, through your children. And sort of inadvertently - through sharing my story, I've realized there's a bit of the legacy I'm creating this way and I'm not ashamed of that. I'm not ashamed to attach my name to what I think is a right that should belong to all terminally ill Americans.'

'I don't want to die,' Maynard explained. 'If anyone wants to hand me, like, a magical cure and save my life so that I can have children with my husband, you know, I will take them up on it.'

She also has made a deal with her mother, Debbie, that if she travels to Machu Pichu in Peru after her passing, Brittany’s spirit will meet her up there among the breathtaking Inca ruins. 

In the same interview, Debbie, who raised Maynard on her own, talks about the discussion she had about her daughter when she learned of her decision.

'Early on, I told her, "It would be my honor to take care of you, whichever way; if you need to be fed or diapered, it would be my honor,"' she said.

'And that was important for me, for her to know.' 

Maynard's husband, Dan Diaz, also spoke about how sad he is that he will not get to spend the rest of his life with the woman he married little over a year ago.

'That was the original plan, right?' he said. 'But the reality that, I guess, that feeds into the argument of quality of life versus just quantity.'
