These stunning images show what must surely be one of the world's most unpleasant jobs - mining for sulphur on the side of a volcano in Indonesia.

Locals near the Ijen volcano complex risk their lives to get their hands on the foul-smelling mineral, and are usually paid just a few pounds a day.

The intrepid miners clamber over sharp rock faces, braving sheer drops from the side of the 2,600-metre-high active volcano which could erupt at any time.

Foul: A miner breaks up chunks of sulphur on the side of the Ijen volcano complex in Indonesia

Danger: The intrepid locals scramble over risky rock faces and brave sheer drops with their precious cargo

Haul: Sulphur is used in a number of common industrial processes such as manufacturing cosmetics and plastics

They make their way around a 200-metre-deep lake bubbling with sulphuric acid to gather the valuable substance, which is used in a number of industrial processes.

These photographs were captured by Robertus Pudyanto, who chronicles the everyday risks taken by the Indonesian miners.

The quietly active volcano emits gases through fumaroles inside the crater, and local miners have tapped those gases to earn a living,' he said.

Unbearable: A miner works hard at excavating the mineral as he is surrounded by hot gasses

Taking a breather: One of the miners wipes his face with his shirt as he pauses from his labours

Burden: But this man carrying 3kg of sulphur will have been paid just a few pounds per day

Starting again: Miners walk back down to the crater with empty baskets to pick up another load of sulphur

'Stone and ceramic pipes cap the fumaroles, and inside the sulphur condenses into a molten red liquid, dripping back down and solidifying into pure sulphur.

'Miners hack chunks off with steel bars, braving extremely dangerous gases and liquids with minimal protection, then load up as much as they can carry for the more than three kilometres to the weighing station.

'Loads can weigh up to 90kg, and a single miner might make as many as two or three trips return in a day.

Risky: The miners endanger their lives with the work on the slopes of an active volcano

Picturesque: But the landscape is less welcoming for the miners who work there every day

Meeting: Miners gather by the weighing station to work out how much they are owed

Chilling out: A miner enjoys a cigarette as he guards his valuable sulphur - the only way of making a living for some

'The hills they walk through are high and steep, and very difficult terrain. When the rainy season comes, the job becomes very slippery and even more dangerous.

'At the end of a long day, miners take home approximately 50,000 rupiah (Â£3.40). The sulphur is then used for vulcanising rubber, bleaching sugar and other industrial processes nearby.'

Among the industries which require the use of sulphur are fertilisers, cosmetics, insecticides and petroleum processing.

It is also used to manufacture paper, paints, plastics, rubber, batteries, explosives and film.

Industry: Sulphur is valued by manufacturers because of its versatile range of uses
