George Osborne last night attacked European judges after they backed a ‘perverse’ EU cap on bankers’ bonuses.

The Chancellor had mounted a legal challenge to the cap but the European Court of Justice, ruled the curbs were ‘valid’ and legal.

The judgment triggered a furious reaction, with the EU accused of attacking the City of London and riding roughshod over Britain’s right to manage its own economy.

Mr Osborne insisted the Brussels plan for a cap on bonuses would prove counterproductive because banks would simply pay higher salaries, which could not be clawed back if things go wrong – unlike bonuses.

But he has now withdrawn his challenge, saying: ‘I am not going to spend taxpayers’ money on a legal challenge now unlikely to succeed.’

In a letter to Bank of England Governor Mark Carney he described the ruling as ‘self-defeating’, saying it could ‘undermine responsibility in the banking system rather than promote it’ by encouraging higher salaries.

The ruling by Niilo Jaaskinen, the court’s Advocate General, would make it ‘more difficult to ensure that the banks and bankers pay when there are mistakes, rather than the taxpayer’, he said.

The cap, enforced at the beginning of the year, restricts banks to paying a maximum bonus of one year’s salary, rising to twice salary if shareholders approve. 

Although the final decision will be made by the Court of Justice early next year, it rarely goes against the Advocate’s decision.

Mr Osborne came under fire from Ukip, with Tory defector Douglas Carswell claiming his pledge to renegotiate a better deal with the EU had ‘all the credibility of a Greek government bond’.

The lavish bankers’ bonus culture has been widely blamed for driving the reckless behaviour that ultimately caused the banking sector to implode.

Britain’s concerns have already been vindicated, with UK banks dodging the bonus cap by paying their top staff seven-figure ‘fixed allowances’ to increase their basic packages. 

Banks have also warned the bonus cap will prompt talented staff to join Asian and US rivals, putting financial services at a disadvantage.

The Treasury launched a legal challenge in September, arguing that the EU had no legal right to introduce pay curbs.

Mr Jaaskinen admitted that setting the level of pay was ‘unquestionably a matter for the member states’, but added: ‘Fixing the ratio of variable remuneration to basic salaries does not equate to a “cap on bankers’ bonuses”, or “fixing the level of pay” because there is no limit imposed on the basic salaries that the bonuses are pegged against.’

Critics said the bonus cap will mean bankers get paid more even if they perform badly.

Tory Mark Garnier said: ‘The investment banking industry is critical to the UK economy. It is vital that we – not meddling bureaucrats from Brussels – control how it is run.’

But Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls said it was ‘a humiliating climbdown’ for Mr Osborne.
