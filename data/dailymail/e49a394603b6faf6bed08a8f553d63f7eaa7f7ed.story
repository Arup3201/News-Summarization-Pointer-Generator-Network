A 33-year age-gap is nothing when you find the one – and when she is 106 years old there is not a second to lose.

That is what Gavin Crawford, 73, thought when he met his ‘princess’ Marjorie Hemmerde in a nursing home three years ago.

The elderly couple from Melbourne, Australia are proof that you can never be too old to fall in love.

Just a number: 106-year-old Marjorie Hemmerde met her 73-year-old boyfriend Gavin Crawford at a Melbourne care home three years ago

Neither Mr Crawford nor Miss Hemmerde ever married and agree that they did not expect to ever find true love.

‘We just sort of melted into each other,’ Ms Hemmerde, a former librarian, told Herald Sun.

'We get along like old friends, the age gap doesn't seem to matter.’

Mr Crawford, describing his girlfriend as ‘cheerful and appreciative’, said: ‘Marjorie is very outgoing and has good outlook in life.'

‘I think we both have learned that life is far too short not to enjoy it.’

Never too late: Gavin and Marjorie are rarely apart, even for a moment, saying life is 'too short not to enjoy it'

But despite time running against them, Miss Hemmerde, a sprightly 106-year-old who holds the record of the oldest person to ever kiss Ireland’s Blarney Stone, has declared that marriage is not on the cards.

‘I'm too irresponsible,’ Ms Hemmerde said. ‘I quite like living in sin.’

Staff at Kew Gardens Aged Care Facility called the relationship ‘beautiful and genuine’.

‘It proves it's never too late,’ social life manager Vicki Fraser said.
