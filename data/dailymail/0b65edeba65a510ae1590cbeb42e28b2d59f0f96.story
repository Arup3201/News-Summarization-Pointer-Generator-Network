Eerie apparitions, spooky sightings and paranormal phenomena are all in days commute for passengers travelling to and from Leamington Spa station.

And now the station which has been plagued by ghosts has employed Supernatural Liaison Officer Nick Rees as their specialist 'ghost hunter'.

As Supernatural Liaison Officer Mr Rees' duties include checking ghosts' tickets, ensuring that they do not eat customers' sandwiches, directing them to their train and generally keeping these spooky spectres in check.  

Nick Rees from Warwick is Leamington Spa train station's Supernatural Liaison Officer

Station host Mr Rees is already a big hit with living customers and was deemed the man for the job after developing a bond with the ghostly guests.

He will now patrol the station, ensuring that passengers won't have to deal with any ghostly high jinks whilst waiting to board their trains.

The father of two from Warwick  volunteered for the role after being approached by Chiltern Railways.

He said: 'I get on with people and I can make anyone smile. I suppose that's why I can go about my duties as a supernatural liaison officer. I respect them and they respect me.

The father of two is currently the station host but will be adding on to his responsibilities 

Built in the late 1800s, the station is reputedly one of the most haunted places in Britain 

Built in the late 1800s, the station is reputedly one of the most haunted places in Britain, with both commuters and station staff reporting supernatural incidents.

One of the haunted areas is a disused basement on platform 3 which has a partially blocked off staircase that seemingly leads to nowhere.

The other area is the upstairs office building where staff regularly see and hear things including doors slamming and electrical equipment turning on and off.

One member of staff said: 'When we first moved into the top floor offices the people who had been there previously had obviously left in a hurry.

'Woooooooh's there?: Mr Ree's duties include checking ghosts' tickets and ensuring that they do not eat customers' sandwiches

'I regularly have paperwork thrown about, drawers left open and hear footsteps. I find it is often a quick way to end a meeting having a door slam for no logical reason. I've now learned to live in harmony with the ghosts.'

Stephen Herbert, a night time security officer at the station, said: 'Leamington Spa station is one of the most haunted places I have been to, and I've been to many.

'I often see and hear ghosts on both platforms but from what I have seen they are nice ghosts and have good energy.'

 As it is his first week in his extended role, Mr Rees will be giving customers garlic bulbs to take home for Halloween.
