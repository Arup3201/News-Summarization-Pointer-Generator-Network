Persistent: Meatball was caught rummaging in the same California garage three times

A 400-pound black bear named Meatball has inspired his very own Twitter following, after he fearlessly broke into the same California home three times to snack on his namesake treat.

But it was on his third visit to the same Los Angeles garage that he was captured and sent to the Lions Tigers & Bears Sanctuary in San Diego County, but not before he established himself as a bit of a social media guru.

Using the pen name 'Glen Bearian', he often shares his thoughts and adventures with his audience, posting such pearls of wisdom as, 'I'm BBB = Big, Black & Beautiful!'

The hilarious feed has amassed more than 28,000 followers, each eagerly awaiting whatever he thinks of next.

'Ummm, yes. Front desk? My jacuzzi seems to be malfunctioning. Someone left a lot of hair in it. Please have housekeeping up right away!' he shares.

Mr Bearian is surely enjoying his stay at the sanctuary, but before long he'll be taken to his permanent home, the Wild Animal Sanctuary in Colorado.

'I hope this isnt one of those timeshare scams...Wanna move out to Colorado with me? I'll let you have the top bunk!' he joked.

Still another Tweet goes as follows: 'After all these tranquilizer shots, they may need to drop me off at Celebrity Rehab...'

But unlike the Bronx Zoo Cobra Tweeter, who is yet to be unmasked, there is no mystery who is behind Glen Bearian.

Words of Wisdom: Meatball often muses on his day to day

Prolfic: Meatball, Tweeting under the handle 'Glen Bearian' had posted close to 2,500 times as of Aug. 31, 2012

'He needs a place where he … can have all the food and facilities for him to have a happy life,'  Sarah Aujero, 29, told the Los Angeles Times.

Aujero, who has proved an ambitious sort, has not only taken to Twitter to give voice to Meatball, but is hawking T-shirts and buttons on a webpage dedicated to the meandering bear.

But it's her Twitter feed that had become her bread-and-butter.

'This
dude's my hero! ...Bear With Sweet Tooth Breaks Into Rocky Mountain 
Chocolate Factory,'  Glen Bearian once Tweeted. 'Shake! Shake! Shake! 
Mmmm... shake'n bake =)'

Of late, Meatball was taken to the rescue facility, Lions Tigers & Bears, in San Diego County. It is there that she'll reportedly stay before being ultimately taken to his permanent home, the Wild Animal Sanctuary in Colorado

Despite its success, the stunt, however, is lacking a bit in originality.

A still-anonymous Tweeter humorously captivated the nation more than a year ago when he assumed the digital identity of a cobra who absconded from his captors at The Bronx Zoo.

That Twitter feed - @BronxZoosCobra - is still alive and going with the latest Tweet from the cobra, which has been caught, posted Aug. 26.

But Miss Aujero has proved far more prolific, posting more than 2,500 times.

'Can I just stay in the tub all day?' The Glendale Bear Captured, En Route to 'Club Med for Bears,'' reads one of them.

Unmasked: Unlike The Bronx Zoo Cobra, Glen Bearian's identity is not in question
