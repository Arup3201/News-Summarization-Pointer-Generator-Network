An overweight student was shamed into losing eight stone after getting wedged in a lecture seat on her first day of university.

Megan Longdon, 20, from Bristol, weighed 17st 5lbs when she started law school at the University of the West of England after years of gorging on takeaways, chocolate and crisps.

She was a dress size 24 and was mortified when she attended her first lecture last September and found herself wedged in her seat when it was time to leave.

Slimmed down: Megan Longdon lost 8st in 11 months, left, after she once tipped the scales at 17st 5lbs

She was forced to wait while fellow students climbed over her to leave before she could wriggle herself free.

She recalls: 'I was just stuck in the arm bits on my hip area, I had the table bit in front of me to lean on, there was not a huge gap. I was making excuses trying to pack my stuff away as slowly as possible so it didn't look like I was stuck.

'People
were a bit confused as to what I was doing and the fact I was telling 
them to climb over me, I didn't know anyone so it was really 
embarrassing.

Wake-up call: The law student's diet used to consist mainly of chocolate and takeaways and she was mortified when she once got stuck in a chair

'Luckily there wasn't another lecture coming in afterwards so I had enough time to prise myself out.

'I
stopped going to university for weeks after it happened I was so 
embarrassed, I missed out on making all my friends and a lot of work, it
was awful.'

The humiliation in September left the aspiring lawyer determined to slash her daily intake of calories and turn her life around.

'I
stopped going to university for weeks after it happened I was so 
embarrassed, I missed out on making all my friends and a lot of work, it
was awful'

She said of her weight: 'It stopped me making a lot of friends during my first year, I didn't socialise at all really.

'It
took a while but I finally decided I couldn't hide in my room and do 
nothing, I needed to go back and do something about it.'

She used to binge on chocolate, bagels, 
crisps and croissants before school, followed by more chocolate and 
sandwiches for lunch.

After 
school she would tuck into yet more crisps before going home for a 
generous helping of a home-cooked dinner with yet more chocolate from a 
stash in her room.

To add to her woes, Megan would often eat takeaways and kebabs because her mother's former partner hated cooking.

Diet overhaul: Megan swapped her calorific snacks for fruit and dropped from a dress size 24 to 8

But since swapping calorie-crammed 
snacks for salads, fruit and a healthy breakfast after joining Slimming World, Megan has trimmed inches
off her waist.

She lost 12lbs in the first week of her diet which she said helped to motivate her to stick with it even though she admits 'it was a bit hard at first to get things in moderation.'

But she stuck with it and continued to slim down losing eight stone in 11 months. She's now 9st 5lbs, a dress size 8, bringing her total weightloss to eight stone.

She's now also started exercising to keep the weight off.

Changed woman: Megan is now also exercising to keep the weight off and has never felt better

She said: 'I didn't exercise while I was losing weight but I now doing fitness training. I have a personal trainer twice a week and I go to the gym twice a week too.'

The student said the weightloss has boosted her confidence and has also helped the rest of her family get in shape - her grandparents and mother have all lost weight as a result of her new healthy eating regime.

Megan said: 'It's so good to finally get back to 'normal' again. I feel a lot better, I can wear dresses and skirts now which is amazing, before I just wore a lot of baggy tops.'
