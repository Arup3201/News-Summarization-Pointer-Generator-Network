Students at Colorado University have been told that if they want to hold weapons on campus they must live together in segregated 'gun dormitories'.

But the move to create the exclusive accommodation blocks at the university's Boulder and Colorado Springs campuses has failed to attract any takers in the three months since it came into effect.

University administrators had previously introduced a blanket ban on guns on campus, however, in March Colorado Supreme Court upheld an appeals-court ruling to allow undergraduates to carry guns.

The new decision, which came into effect on August 16, states that students over the age of 21 who possess a permit to hold a concealed handgun must live in separate residential areas, with guns being banned on the rest of the campus.

Attendees at university athletic and cultural events, such as American Football games and theatre shows, on both campuses are not permitted to bring guns.

Colorado University Chancellor Philip DiStefano said in a statement: 'I believe we have taken responsible steps to adhere to the ruling of the Colorado Supreme Court, while balancing that with the priority of providing a safe environment for our students, faculty and staff.'

The issue of guns on university campuses was forced into the spotlight in the wake of several campus shootings, the most deadly being the 2007 incident at Virginia Tech University.

However, while for some, these events
 signal a need to ease existing firearm regulations and allow concealed 
weapons on campuses, others see the solution in tightening restrictions 
to keep guns off campuses completely.

At
 Colorado University the concealed-carry issue hit the headlines again 
this month when a staff member with a concealed-carry permit at the 
School of Dental Medicine on the Anschutz Medical campus accidentally 
shot a co-worker while showing her gun.

Currently, there are 21 states that ban carrying a concealed weapon on a college campus. These include California, Florida, Georgia, New York and Texas.

In 23 states, such as Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Connecticut and Virginia the decision to ban or allow concealed carry weapons on campuses is made by each college or university individually.

Due to recent state legislation and court rulings, five states now have special provisions allowing the carrying of concealed weapons on public post-secondary campuses.Â  These states are Colorado, Mississippi, Oregon, Utah, and Wisconsin.

Utah remains the only state to have statute specifically naming public colleges and universities as public entities that do not have the authority to ban concealed carry, and thus, all ten public institutions in Utah allow concealed weapons on their property.

Recently passed Wisconsin legislation creates a provision that colleges and universities must allow concealed carry on campus grounds, however, campuses can prohibit weapons from campus buildings if signs are posted at every entrance explicitly stating that weapons are prohibited.
