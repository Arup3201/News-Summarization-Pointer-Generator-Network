Ever felt like getting away from it all? Well one Kansas couple took that adage really to heart and departed on an incredible adventure across the U.S. with their young son - quitting their jobs and selling everything they owned to do it.

Joshua and Jessa Works decided to ditch their nine-to-five routine in order to travel the U.S. almost four years ago and have spent since 2011 living out of the 27-foot airbus they bought to replace their five-bedroom house and everything inside it.

Sharing images on their blog Tomorrow Somewhere New, the family has visited locations from Hawaii to New York and Yellowstone to Niagara Falls - a whopping 47 U.S states in total.

Quite the change from their old lives which they described as a ‘loop-de-loop routine of commutes, cooking, cleaning and being couch potatoes’.

‘I think we just get caught up in chasing some sort of version of success. We had excellent jobs that would allow us to do that except for the time that we wanted to be spending outdoors,’ Joshua said in a Dark Rye film about the trip.

‘So we decided to sell all of our stuff, sell our cars, put our house on the market, buy an Airstream and hit the road.’

‘Once he started pointing out that we were set in this routine that may in fact be the same routine that we would be living for the rest of our lives, we started looking at it much more closely,’ Jessa adds on the film. ‘How many of those choices, were choices we had made? Really none of it was.’

The couple invested in improving a basic Airstream travel trailer to include mod-cons like an Apple computer and memory foam mattresses. They made-over the sleeping arrangements (a pair of bunk beds) and the kitchen and bathroom until the bus more closely resembled a modern and chic - if a little compact - family home.

47 states: The family have been traveling since 2011 and have visited numerous sights and beautiful landscapes across the U.S.

As a web developer and graphic designer, Joshua and Jessa, respectively, left their jobs behind but were able to work freelance while on the move so they could afford to keep funding their travelling existence.

Belongings were kept to a handful of goods and even Jack’s toys were ditched in the clearout however the couple say the adventure alone was more than enough to keep him entertained.

On the latest set of family photos Jack can be seen enjoying July 4 in the Grand Canyon and flashes a huge smile as he collects sticks and rambles across the great american outdoors.

‘It’s become this amazing tool for Jack. We knew when we started it would be a great opportunity for him but we had no idea how powerful it would be for his creativity and imagination,’ Jessa explained.

‘We’ve traded our small back yard for this expansive world,’ Joshua added.

Memories: The family is now back in Kansas starting a new, stationary life in a farmhouse but they still look fondly back on their epic journey across the states

Wisdom: ‘The hardest part of doing something interested is getting started. If we can convince ourselves to get on our coats and get on our backpacks something great can happen,’ Josh concludes

That’s not to say the entire trip has been smooth sailing. As they point out there was very little time to be alone in the confined truck and without a regular home and babysitter, date-nights were pretty much out of the window.
