A glass of red can taste exquisite on holiday in the south of France, but have a hint of bitterness back home in front of the television.

This is because wine tastes different depending on the conditions it is drunk in, according to scientists.

Experimental psychologists at Oxford University believe light and sound affect how fruity, bitter or acidic the wine is, which means the tipple you drunk abroad will taste different when you get home.

Professor Charles Spence believes the results could change how bottles are labelled.

In future bottles may have advice attached such as ‘drink while listening to classical music’ or ‘best served after dark.’

'We’ve all been in that situation where you being a bottle of wine back from holiday and you excitedly open it with friends, only to find it doesn’t taste anything like you remember it did,' he told The Sunday Telegraph.

'Of course the wine is still the same. They only thing that has changed is your environment.'

He added that wine drinkers should play music to recreate the atmosphere experienced on holiday or wait for a warm summers evening.

Professor Spence will test the theory in a multi-sensory experiment at the Streets of Spain festival on London’s Southbank next month,

In a ‘Colour Lab’, he will ask visitors to rate how wine tastes depending on light and music.

The 
experiment works by shining different colours of light on the drinker with sounds 
playing as they taste an unknown wine in a black glass.

A study by the University of Tübingen in 2009 found that participants rated wine as tasting 50 per cent sweeter if drunk under red light, rather than blue or white.

The latest experiment is being 
sponsored by Spanish wine label Campo Viejo. Winemaker Roberto Vicente tested the lab and found that is own wine tasted different under a variety of lights.

Weather: The research also suggested that wine drinkers should wait till a warm summers evening to drink their favourite bottle

Mr Vicente said he was amazed to find that his own wine tasted so different when the lights changed from red to green.

'In the white light at the beginning I could tell that this was my wine,' he told the paper.

But he said when the red lights came on he thought: 'Oh my God, this is really ripe and really sweet on the palette and the bitterness has vanished’.

A previous study by Oxford University found that when experienced tasters were given champagne in black glasses, they struggled to tell the difference between a cheap sparkling wine and an expensive bottle.

Last year Salisbury District Hospital discovered that patients ate more if food was presented on blue plates.

Studies have shown that humans appear to be attracted to red food because it signals ripeness, sweetness and calories.
