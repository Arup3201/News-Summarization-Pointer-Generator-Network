Nico Rosberg believes he can force Lewis Hamilton into making a crucial mistake in their Formula One title showdown on Sunday.

Rosberg, who trails the British driver by 17 points, said: ‘I need some help from Lewis to clinch the title, and I am going to try to put as much pressure on him as I can.

‘He has been making some mistakes recently so maybe there is a chance.’

Rosberg claims that his Mercedes team-mate has been 'making some mistakes' recently 

1. Lewis Hamilton - 334 points 

2. Nico Rosberg - 317 points 

Lewis Hamilton will be crowned world champion if he finishes second in the season-ending Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, even if Nico Rosberg wins the race.

If the final race was a ‘normal’ race with 25 points for the winner, rather than the double points on offer, Hamilton would be able to claim his second drivers’ title with a sixth-place finish.

The Brit must finish first or second at Yas Marina, where the final grand prix carries double points, to be certain of taking the title.

Hamilton, who was slow to shake Rosberg’s hand at their press conference, insisted he would not use dirty games to win. He said: ‘We’re not children. We should know what is wrong and right.’

'This is an extremely exciting moment for my career.

'I am fighting for the world championship at the last race, I have a good chance to win, and this is what I have been working towards since I began racing as a small child.
