A green tax that comes into effect today will drive tens of thousands of families into fuel poverty, experts warn.

The ‘carbon price floor’ is designed to ensure suppliers use less gas, coal and oil – but has been described as a ‘stealth poll tax’ on individuals and businesses.

Analysts say the levy on the production of electricity from fossil fuels will account for an 8 per cent rise on household bills in just two years.

The IPPR think that households will pay more than 10 per cent of disposable income on heating and lighting

It will raise billions for the Treasury, but a report from the Institute for Public Policy Research found it is likely to hit economic growth.

The IPPR estimates that the tax will push up to 60,000 more households into fuel poverty – when more than 10 per cent of disposable income is spent on heating and lighting – this year alone. This will rise to 90,000 a year by 2020, as the tax rises sharply in successive Budgets.

The think-tank predicts that wholesale electricity price will rise by around 17 per cent in three years due to the tax, which will equate to around an 8 per cent rise on energy bills.

Critics have said that the green tax is nothing but a way for The government, including the Chancellor George Osborne, to raise money for the Exchequer

By contrast, subsidised companies selling electricity from wind farms and nuclear power stations will receive a £1.2billion boost over the next three years, as they benefit from the effect on the fossil fuel market.

Tony Cocker, boss of E.ON UK, said the carbon price floor is ‘pretty close to a stealth poll tax’. He added: ‘It’s not based on ability to pay, it’s based on the requirement to keep warm and light your house. It was put in place with the stated objective of encouraging investment in low-carbon energy but it certainly doesn’t achieve that objective. It’s just a tax for the Exchequer.’ 

The IPPR’s report notes that ‘the environmental case [for the tax] is threadbare at best’, but adds it will raise £4.42billion for the Government over three years – more than the bill for cutting corporation tax, or increasing the personal tax allowance.

Ministers claim that the public could actually save money by buying energy efficient appliances

Last year, the all-party energy and climate change select committee warned that the tax would place British companies at a disadvantage compared with international rivals.

However, the Treasury said: ‘The carbon price floor is vital in reducing uncertainty and creating incentives for investment in low carbon electricity generation now so we have lower emissions in the future.’

Last week, the Government admitted that the cost of green taxes will more than double by 2020 to almost £300 a year. 

However, ministers claim that families will end up paying less based on assumptions that they will cut their energy use by more than a quarter, largely by buying efficient appliances, over the same period.
