Australia is the sixth most expensive place in the world to live in, according to new research

Switzerland has been named as the costliest place to live in the world by movehub - resource for those who wish to move abroad

Movehub explains the cost of groceries took into account the price for meat, bread, rice, eggs, fruits, vegetables and alcohol. 

While, transportation costs included one-way tickets, monthly passes, taxi fares, petrol prices and other costs related to running a car based on the use of Volkswagen Golf. 

Meal prices at expensive, mid-range and inexpensive restaurants were taken into account along with prices of coffee products, alcohol and water.

Electricity, heating, water the internet were the utilities assessed.

All nations were compared to the cost of living in New York.

For example, if a country has a consumer price index of 70 on movehub's infographic then on average its cost of living is 30 per cent cheaper than that of New York's.

Australia also beat out the United Kingdom (pictured), which came in at the 10th place

The Land Down Under also beat out France, which was ranked even below the U.K., in 15th place

Therefore, the average cost of living for an Australian is almost one per cent cheaper than for someone living in the Big Apple.

It may come as a surprise to some that Venezuela came in at number three on the list, but the South American national owes much of its expensive cost of living to the fluctuating economy that means wages are low while prices of goods continue to rise.

Venezuela's tightening financial situation has fanned market anxiety about a default, especially as oil slumps to near six-year lows.  

President Nicholas Maduro has vowed to pay bondholders and most economists doubt a default is coming in the near-term, but investors are getting skittish as the economic crisis worsens.

India comes out as having the lowest cost of living, with poor wages matched by poor living conditions 

Venezuela depends on oil for 96 per cent of its export revenue. 

Australia even beat out the United Kingdom, which ranked the 10th costliest place to live, France and the United States - which did not even break into the top 15.

There were not many surprises where it comes to the countries with the lowest cost of living.

India topped the pile in this regard, followed in by Nepal, Pakistan, Tunisia and Algeria.

South America's sole entry in the top 15 cheapest places to live was Colombia, typically another country dependent on the strengths of the oil industry.
