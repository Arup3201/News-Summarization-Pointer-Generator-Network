Prince William's has impressed the Chinese with his language skills after wishing the country Happy New Year in Mandarin, ahead of his visit to China next month.

In a video clip - shown by Chinese state broadcaster CCTV - the Duke of Cambridge told viewers: 'Zhu ni men chun jie kuai le, yang nian da ji' (I wish you a happy Chinese New Year and good luck in the Year of the Sheep).

His Mandarin went down well in China, with one social media user describing it as 'cute' and another saying people usually focus of his receding hairline, but his 'Chinese is great'. 

The message, which was broadcast last night and watched by millions, came on the eve of Chinese New Year, with 2015 becoming the Year of the Sheep.

Warm wishes: Prince William wished Chinese viewers a Happy New Year in a new video message broadcast last night

In the message, the Prince said he is pleased to be visiting the country to launch the Great Festival of Creativity and mark the start of the Year of Cultural Exchange.

'I'm very pleased to be visiting China soon,' he said. 'Together, the United Kingdom and China have much to celebrate about our cultural relationship - what we have in common and what we can learn from one another.' 

According to The Telegraph, one user of Weibo - the Chinese equivalent of Twitter - wrote: 'It was so cute when Prince William spoke Mandarin. Could he bring his little boy to China soon?'

Another wrote: 'People always go on about his hairline, but his Chinese is great'. 

A Twitter user tweeted: 'Bloody hell watching chinese news and prince william's speaking mandarin wishing happy chinese new year!' 

Today, Prince Charles also showed off his own language skills during a visit to London's Chinatown.

He made a speech in which he revealed he and Camilla were 'thrilled' to be there and made an attempt at wishing revellers a Happy New Year in Cantonese.

'Xin Nian Hao (Happy New Year)' Charles told the crowds, adding: 'I rather hope the [Chinese] Ambassador [Liu Xiaoming] will give me a tutorial after.'

The Great Festival of Creativity will take place at Shanghai's Long Museum from March 2 to 4, with the Prince travelling to the city after spending time in Beijing.

During the Festival, British commercial creativity and innovation will be given a platform that will put it in front of a high profile business audience from the UK, China and beyond.

The Prince and the Government hope it will create opportunities for UK companies to break into one of the world's fastest growing markets. More than 500 businesses are expected to attend.

Similarly, the UK-China Year of Cultural Exchange is the first to be held and is expected to give a boost to British business and commerce.

Underpinned by a government-to-government agreement set out at the UK-China Summit in London last June, the exchange will showcase UK culture in China and Chinese culture in the UK.

It is designed to inspire and support creative talent, stimulating collaboration between artists and creative organisations in both countries. 

It is the start of the Chinese Lunar New Year and the Year of the Sheep is being celebrated in style around the world.

Locals and visitors alike have taken to the streets, particularly in countries where it is a public holiday, like Taiwan, Singapore and Malaysia.

Known as Tet in Vietnam and Seollal in South Korea, the 40-day festival is traditionally a time to be with family but involves spectacular dances, dangerous stunts and the traditional gifting of 'hong bao' packets.

Dating back as far as the 14th century, this year's celebrations will mark the beginning of year 4713 on the Chinese calendar. 

It marks the beginning of a new agricultural season, as well as a new year, and is considered a time to reunite and take part in traditions intended to bring good fortune over the coming 12 months.

In China, this period is also known as the Spring Festival, and traditionally, it kicks off with a large meal known as the reunion dinner where dumplings and fish are served as symbols of prosperity. 

Families take great care to be together on this night, which is usually held on New Year's Eve.

Many cities put up colourful decorations for the season and engage in celebratory parades, dancing Chinese dragons, and fire displays.

The colour red is most often used, as the hue is believed to ward off evil and is associated with luck. It's also customary to wear new red clothes to symbolise a new start. 

The burning of paper money as an offering to ancestors is also traditional New Year activity in some areas.

This year, the Tibetan New Year also falls on February 19, the same day as the Chinese Lunar New Year, which the autonomous region celebrated with a fireworks display above the Potala Palace. 

People also exchange red packets, called 'hong bao',, which children often open on New Year's Eve. These contain 'lucky' cash.

Each country, however, typically has its own traditional foods for the celebration. One commonality is the idea of 'out with the old and in with the new.'

In the lead up to the celebrations, houses are cleaned from top to bottom, with some Chinese people even taking a bath in pomelo leaves to enhance their prosperity further.

Following such a bath, it's also traditional not to wash your hair during the initial days of the new year so as to not risk washing out any of your newly acquired good luck. 

Though widely referred to as the year of the sheep, 2015 is also known as the year of the goat, because the Chinese character is the same for both.
