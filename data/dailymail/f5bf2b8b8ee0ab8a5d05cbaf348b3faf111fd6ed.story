The mother of a girl, who was abducted by a couple desperate to conceive and then dumped her two days later in a derelict house, has spoken out about her 'special bond' with her child.

A decade ago on August 7, 2004, Anita Ciancio experienced every parent's worst nightmare.

Her three-month-old baby, Montana Barbaro, was snatched during their first outing together as mother and daughter in a shopping centre carpark after she was assaulted by Mark and Cheryl McEachran.

On the tenth anniversary of her daughter's abduction, Anita Ciancio has opened up about how it has affected their life

Montana was found by a jogger who heard her cries from inside a rundown North Melbourne home after the couple spent two days treating her as their own child and cutting her hair.

Marking the tenth anniversary of the abduction of Montana, Ms Ciancio - who also has a 11-year-old daughter and two sons aged seven and one - opened up about her relationship with her daughter, who is now 10, and how it had impacted on their life.

The mother-of-four said it had changed the way she had raised her children and how they had lived.

Ms Ciancio said they never went out to play in the park like other children and their childhood had been 'robbed.

Two days after Montana Barbaro - then three-weeks-old (pictured here in Ms Ciancio's arms) - was abducted she was found dumped in a derelict home in North Melbourne

Ms Ciancio (pictured here with Montana's father, Joe Barbaro, in 2004) said she and her daughter shared a special bond

Ms Ciancio said the only good thing that came out of Montana's abduction was the effect it had on their relationship.

'I feel Montana’s heart when she’s not with me,' she told the Herald Sun.

'It is…like someone’s got a string with our hearts and it’s like pulling it and tearing it, and she hurts and I hurt.

'We feel it at the exact same time and I feel like I know when she’s crying or she’s upset if she’s not with me.'

A married couple, Mark and Cheryl McEachran snatched Montana from Ms Ciancio (centre with supporters in 2005) a shopping centre on August 7, 2004

The McEachrans were sentenced to 12 years in total in 2005, a year after the abduction

Montana said she loved how protective her mother was of her and that their relationship was 'any other mother and daughter relationship'.

Despite the pain her kidnappers caused, Montana told the Herald Sun she wanted to meet the McEachrans.

'Because they’re very sick people and you shouldn’t take away another mother’s child just because you want another child, because you’re ruining their time with [their] child,' she said.

'Why would they take me away, why would they ruin my mum’s chance with me when I was a baby?'

Cheryl McEachran was sentenced to four and a half years' jail in 2005 at Melbourne's County Court, while Mark McEachran got seven and half years.
