Cristiano Ronaldo is scoring goals at a ratio of more than two-a-game as he goes into this week's Champions League match with Liverpool at Anfield.

After a brace in a comfortable 5-0 away win against Levante he moved to 15 goals in seven league games – it's a record start to the season in the Spanish league and it gives him a better scoring average than most teams in Europe. He will score over 70 this season if he continues at his current rate.

Real Madrid made light work of Levante. Livepool will be a far tougher test but Carlo Ancelotti's team are starting to resemble the side that won last season's European Cup.

Real Madrid were without an under-the-weather Karim Benzema and the injured Sergio Ramos. Gareth Bale watched the game from the bench and Luka Modric hobbled off with a bruised foot in the second half. If all four are fit to play against Liverpool the Real Madrid coach's most difficult job will be to decide who to leave out.

Levante came into the game not having scored at home yet this season but they have a habit of making life very difficult for Real Madrid and might have fancied their chances against an injury and illness-affected opposition. 

But Ancelotti had said in the week that naming Ronaldo in his starting XI is worth a goal start for his team and so it proved again.

Ronaldo almost scored inside the first two minutes when found with a long ball out of defence from Luka Modric but he shot uncharacteristically wide of the target. 

Real Madrid's talisman doesn't need three chances to score and with his second opportunity from the spot he shot past Diego Marino to make it 1-0.

Cristiano Ronaldo, Javier Hernandez and James Rodriguez were all on the scoresheet against Levante on Saturday

It was not his most convincing penalty but it went through the keeper's hands. The spot-kick award had also been slightly dubious. Hernandez went down in the area under a challenge from Juanfran who protested vehemently that he had got the ball not the man.

It was Ronaldo's 14th goal in eight league games – something no-one had done at the start of a season in Spain since Oviedo's Echevarría in the 1943 season. Juanfran was booked for the foul that led to the penalty and so was Victor Camarasa when he up-ended Ronaldo under the referee's nose moments later.

Modric forced Marino into a fine save with a vicious shot from the edge of the area and from Madrid's next attack they did double their lead. James Rodriguez crossed from the right and Hernandez headed down and beyond Marino for his third goal of the season.

For all the fire-power lost in midfield due to Bale's absence Madrid had gained in balance with the extra natural midfielder and the Rodriguez, Modric, Toni Kroos, Isco quartet was in complete control of the game for Madrid. 

The later was particularly outstanding and will feel justifiably hard done by when he is left out for the returning Bale on Wednesday. 

It was Isco who started the move that led to the third goal scored by Ronaldo, who cut in from the left, ghosting past Juanfran before burying a shot past Marino for his 15th goal of the season.

Levante had long since accepted their fate and Kroos was allowed to look up and pick his pass for the spectacular fourth goal scored by Rodriguez, who collected the floated assist on his chest before volleying home. 

The brilliant Isco rifled in a glorious fifth to mean Madrid have now won their last five league games, scoring 25 goals and conceding only three. 

'We are in great form going to Anfield,' said the midfielder.
