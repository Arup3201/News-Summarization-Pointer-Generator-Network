A pair of music-loving bartenders are serving up pub sing-alongs with a difference - after inventing a piano capable of making drinks.

Antonia Dumitrescu and Raluca Macalet, from Bucharest in Romania, have created a 'Pianocktail' that can mix up to five different types of cocktail, including Bloody Marys and Manhattans.

Not content with just serving up the odd dram of whisky, the pair have designed the instrument to make complicated concoctions with each drink represented by a different piece of music.

Antonia Dumitrescu and Raluca Macalet, from Bucharest in Romania, have created a 'Pianocktail' that can mix up to five different types of drink, including Bloody Marys and Manhattans

The pair have designed the instrument to make complicated concoctions with each drink represented by a different piece of music

When pianist Sandra Popescu, 26, starts playing, the ingredients are mixed together and served up in a bowl.

Ms Dumitrescu, 27, said: 'The operating principle is rather simple; when you hit a key it triggers an impulse which makes the beverage flow from a certain container, mix on a chute, drop in a bowl and creates the cocktail for the specific piece of music.

'So, when for example, Sandra plays Beethoven's Fur Elise, the piano makes a Manhattan.'

Ms Macalet, also 27, added: 'The idea came from reading a book by French author Boris Vian called Froth on the Daydream.

'There's a scene in the book where a piano makes cocktails, with every song having a different flavour and I thought it would be great to be able to taste a melody.'

When the pianist hits certain keys it triggers a device which makes the drink flow from its container before the liquid drains off into a mixing bowl

The duo, who are both 27-years-old, have now applied to have their musical invention registered

Now the pair, who are taking their cocktail-making piano around the capital, say they want to expand the number of drinks it can make.

Ms Dumitrescu said: 'At the moment it can only make five, but in the future we want to be able to do more, which will mean not only more drinks but more songs too.'

So far their piano cocktail is proving a hit.

Pub-goer Nicolae Maniu, 25, said: 'It's pretty cool although it does take a bit of time to get your drink.

'And they don't do requests so you can't really have a good singalong. But the drinks are good and its early days yet so I'm excited to see where this goes.'

The duo have now applied to have their invention registered.
