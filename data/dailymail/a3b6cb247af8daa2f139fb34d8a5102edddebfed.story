It can be one of the biggest – and costliest – banes of travellers’ lives.

You land at an airport and you need to make a quick journey into the city centre – so grab a taxi to take you there in the quickest possible time.

Only then do you discover that the cost of this transfer is something akin to the national budget of one of the planet’s smaller nations.

A new survey has found Australia has three of the most expensive five airport taxi rides, with Sydney, Perth and Melbourne only out-priced by Christchurch and Queenstown in New Zealand.

A taxi ride from Mascot to Sydney's city centre 12km away is the third most expensive in the world, beaten only by Christchurch and Queenstown

The research, 
conducted by New Zealand company Digital Hothouse – presented below in an 
infographic – has found that Christchurch has the most expensive airport
 taxi rides on the planet.

Taxi passengers in the 
biggest city on New Zealand’s South Island face an eye-watering average 
rate per kilometre of NZ$4.50 – or AU$4.20 for 1000 metres.

And with 10km separating Christchurch's airport from the centre, that equates to an overall cost of NZ$45 ($42) for a ride into town.

Fares are no less budget-busting on this side of the Tasman.

Sydney is listed as the chief Australian offender, with an average rate per kilometre of $3.96, or $47.79 for the 12km journey to the centre.

Perth cabs charge $3.79 per 1000m and Melbourne travellers are charged $3.53, or more than $63 for the 18km journey.

London was rated eighth most expensive while Madrid, Moscow, Rome and Los Angeles also scored badly.
