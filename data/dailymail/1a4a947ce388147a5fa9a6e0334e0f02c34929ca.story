A British doctor has become the first person to finish the world's hottest curry at a UK restaurant - despite suffering hallucinations brought on by the dish.

Consultant radiologist Ian Rothwell, 55, took over an hour to eat 'The Widower' curry - which tops six million units on the Scoville Scale and is hotter than a drink of anti-riot tear gas.

The curry, which is filled with 20 Naga Infinity Chillis - the second hottest on the planet -  is so dangerous to make it has to be prepared by chefs wearing goggles and a face mask.

But Dr Rothwell became the first out 
of 300 people to successfully tackle the curry at the Bindi restaurant 
in Grantham, Lincolnshire, on Thursday evening - and said completing the challenge was harder than when he climbed Mount Kilimanjaro last year.

Before: Consultant radiologist Ian Rothwell, 55, had to sign a disclaimer acknowledging his awareness of the risks involved with eating the curry before getting stuck into the chicken dish - washed down with a bottle of Cobra lager

After signing a disclaimer acknowledging his awareness of the risks involved with eating the curry, Dr Rothwell got ate the chicken dish with a bottle of Cobra beer.

Despite walking out of the restaurant
 half-way through after suffering hallucinations, he returned a short 
time later when his wife found him wandering along the high street.

And fighting back tears for another hour, Dr Rothwell finally managed to swallow the last mouthful to defeat the dish.

'I like hot curries and have at least one a week, but this was off the scale,' he said. 'It took me about an hour to eat it and I had to stop half way through and go out for a walk and some fresh air.

'My wife and the owner were quite worried and said I was hallucinating, but I managed to go back inside and finish the curry.'

Mr Rothwell decided to take up the challenge after his daughter Alice's boyfriend told him his friends had failed to eat the hot curry.

Brave: Dr Rothwell had to take a walk outside when he started hallucinating, but returned to finish the dish through tears

Triumph: Muhammed Karim, managing director and executive chef at the restaurant, presents Dr Rothwell with his certificate. He said 300 people have attempted the Widower and failed with 'people crying, sweating, shaking and vomiting'

It took him more than an hour to eat 
the curry dish, which he washed down with mouthfuls of cobra beer and a 
small amount of rice.

'I trained as a doctor in Leeds and 
later as a radiologist in Manchester, so as a student I got used to 
eating curries as they were cheap,' he said.

'This curry got hotter and hotter as I went on and it was a struggle to finish, but I was determined to succeed.

'The owner offered me a glass of milk to help with the hotness, but I decided to stick with beer and I think that helped.

'I had to take a short break and go 
for a walk as I felt really sweaty and the owner said I was 
hallucinating, but I think it was just the endorphins from all the 
chillis.'

His daughter Alice, 23, said they all tried the curry but could only manage half a teaspoon.

'I knew it was hot when dad admitted 
it was rather hot as he never does that,' she said. 'But he seemed to 
manage it without many problems. We were all clutching our stomachs 
after just half a teaspoon, it blew my head off.'

Muhammed Karim, managing director and
 executive chef at the restaurant said: 'It took Mr Rothwell just over 
an hour to eat The Widower - but that included a 10 minute walk down 
Grantham High Street when he started hallucinating.

'More than 300 people have tackled The Widower before - including about 10 women - but no one has ever been able to finish one.

'Most manage about seven mouthfuls before they give up.

'We've had people sweating, crying, shaking and vomiting.

'We even had to ring an ambulance once.'

Hell's kitchen: Dr Rothwell took on the challenge at Bindi restaurant in Grantham, Lincolnshire

Fiery dish: The dish contained 20 Naga chillies, which is the second hottest chilli in the world at over six million Scovilles after the Trinidad Moruga Scorpion

Mr Karim said Dr Rothwell, who is a regular curry eater from Sudbrooke, excelled at the culinary challenge.

He
 added: 'Apart from spotting a few tears in his eyes, and the short 
period of hallucinating, he was cool and collected and seemed to cope 
very well.

'I have tried The Widower and it really is a killer.

'Even making it is a painful experience - despite wearing goggles and a protective face mask.

'Dr Rothwell is a legend as far as I'm concerned.'
