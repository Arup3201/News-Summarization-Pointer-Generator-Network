Dr Louise Selby said she was left 'speechless' at the 'blatant sexism' of Pure Gym after she was locked out of the female changing rooms

A doctor has accused a gym chain of ‘blatant sexism’ for assuming she must be a man because of her profession.

Paediatrician Louise Selby was issued with a security passcode to enter her local Pure Gym branch.

But the PIN repeatedly failed to work on the door to the women’s changing room because the membership management system was programmed to register anyone with the title ‘Dr’ as male. 

The chain – which has 90 gyms from Aberdeen to Southampton and plans to open another 40 this year – yesterday admitted that the problem is nationwide and asked any female doctors who use its facilities to contact its membership team.

Dr Selby said she was ‘outraged’ when she asked staff for help at the Pure Gym in Cambridge and was told what the problem was.

‘Their archaic attitudes to women and blatant sexism really are second to none,’ she said. ‘They may have modern machines but their attitudes are firmly stuck in the early 20th century.

‘I was speechless and I’m not often speechless. If it is some sort of IT glitch then why don’t they fix it?

‘There was even an option on the [application] form to say whether you are male or female. They should offer an apology to people who are affected because it has caused offence.’

Dr Selby, 31, from Balsham, Cambridgeshire, sent a complaint to the gym’s Twitter account after having to ask other women to let her into the locker room for several weeks.

Dr Selby said she had experienced sexism in the past with people assuming she is a nurse or secretary because of her sex and says there a need for change. 

CEO of PureGym, Humphrey Cobbold, said; 'We would like to apologise for the inconvenience and frustration caused to Dr Selby and any other female doctors who may have been affected.

'There is certainly no intention on our part to be sexist. 

'There are currently more than 200,000 female members of PureGym and a large proportion of our staff are female and are absolutely an integral and essential part of our business. 

Dr Selby was told by staff at the gym that the code she was given to get into the women's changing rooms wouldn't work because all people with the title 'Dr' are automatically registered as men

The gym said the error was down to a 'glitch' in its system and that staff were looking into the issue

'It is very unfortunate that an error between two of the systems we use gave the appearance that all doctors are male and we are working to ensure that this does not happen again. 

'We encourage any members who have been affected by this issue to call or email our member services team.'

A company spokesman refused to name the firm that supplied its IT system.

A spokesman for Pure Gym said the had now removed 'Dr' from their sign up forms, and are contacting all members who are doctors in order to address any problems they are having
