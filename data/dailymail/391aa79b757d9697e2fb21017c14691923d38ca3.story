This pair of baby-faced robbers are being hunted by police after they pushed a 12-year-old schoolboy off his bike and stole his mobile phone.

The youths, who look distinctively young, targeted the youngster who was cycling in woodland in Blackley, Greater Manchester, earlier this month.

After approaching him on the afternoon of May 5, one of the boys kicked him and pinned him down while the other plundered an iPhone 4s from his pocket.

Young thugs: The police are hunting these baby-faced robbers after a 12-year-old schoolboy had his bike stolen during an attack earlier this month

The boys, who are both white and described as being about 15 years old, ran off into the woods.

One had ginger hair and freckles and the other had blonde hair.

The victim was not seriously injured.

Detective Constable Mike Keogh of Greater Manchester Police, said: 'What is immediately striking - and concerning - is just how young these two robbers appear.

'They have been described as being 15 or 16 years old and while their baby faces give them a younger appearance we have been able to compile two very realistic images and I am certain someone in the local community will recognise them.

'If you are able to identify someone from these images - be it a neighbour friend or relative - please get in touch.'
