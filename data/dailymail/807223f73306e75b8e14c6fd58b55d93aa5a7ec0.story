Two Britons have died from heart attacks at a popular holiday spot in Cyprus during a desperate rescue attempt after one of them got into trouble in the sea.

Bernard Harris, 53, from London, and Christine Elizabeth McLeish Sugarhood, 66, from West Sussex, died after Mrs Sugarhood passed out in the water near Paphos.

According to police Mrs Sugarhood went into the water to help her husband Montague - who is known as Norman - who got into difficulty in rough waves.

Police say Norman made it back to shore, but Mrs Sugarhood then suffered a heart attack and lost consciousness, at which point Mr Harris swam out in another rescue attempt.

Bernard Harris, 53,  noticed Mrs Sugarhood was struggling and dragged her to shore, but while giving her CPR he also had a heart attack and died at the scene (pictured, the hotel where the couples were staying)

He managed to drag her back to the beach where he began performing CPR, when he also had a heart attack and died instantly.

Paramedics pronounced Mr Harris dead at the scene, and took Mrs Sugarhood to a nearby private clinic where she was pronounced dead on arrival.

A spokesman for the police in Paphos said: 'A man from England was swimming yesterday and his wife tried to save him because he had a problem in the sea. 

'The wife saved her husband but got into a problem in the water. A third person tried to save the woman. He got her out of the water but they both died, because of a heart attack.'

The spokesman said that following post-mortem examinations a coroner today found they both died from heart attacks.

The incident occurred in the Yeroskipou area of the tourist resort in the south-west of Cyprus, near to the Athena Beach Hotel, police said. 

Mrs Sugarhood lived with her 80-year-old husband Montague at a £1million home in Lindfield, West Sussex. Monatague has three children from a previous marriage, while Mrs Sugarhood has two, again from a previous union.

The couple are not thought to have had any children together. Mr Montague had been a senior banker at Barclays, where the couple met, before they retired.

Neighbours today spoke kindly of the retired pair. One said: 'They were such a lovely couple – really friendly. Christine always had a smile on her face, and she absolutely loved swimming.

'They bought the house just because it had a pool, I think.She would forever be talking about swimming – I gather she must have been quite good.

Mrs Sugarhood lived in this £1million house with her husband Montague. The pair met at Barclays, where they both worked, but had retired

'I don’t know their children very well, but I think they have a son and two daughters.Their son is flying out to Cyprus today to be with his father.'

Another neighbour, who asked not to be named, said: 'Christine was a massive fan of swimming. I think she used to go swimming in her pool almost every day.

'It’s such a tragedy – we’re all absolutely shocked. All our thoughts are with her husband, children and grandchildren at this sad time.'

Norman, who is still in Cyprus, was too distraught to speak at length today, but revealed that three people had given his wife CPR on the beach, including Mr Harris.

He confirmed that he has been in contact with his son following the tragedy, and added: 'You can imagine what the loss means.'

Mr Sugarhood's first wife, Marylin, told The Times: 'It is a complete shock because she was extremely fit and active. They were enjoying retirement together and were living life to the full.

'Christine was such a wonderful person and I was so pleased that Norman had found someone like her and they got on so well.'

The couple are thought to have travelled to the Greek island with the Lindfield Bowling Club.

Speaking to MailOnline, secretary Mike O'Donnell said: 'We at Lindfield Bowling Club were shocked to hear the circumstances and that Christine has passed away. Our thoughts are with her husband and family.

'Christine was an active and popular member involved in all aspects of the club and she will be greatly missed.' 

Police say holidaymakers on the beach at Paphos saw Mrs Sugarhood struggling in the water at around 5pm yesterday.

Officers say Mrs Sugarhood fell unconscious in the sea but didn't go under the surface, adding that Mr Harris did appear to know her.

Mr Harris was on holiday with his wife Janet, and the pair were staying at the four-star Athena Beach Hotel, which they have visited for the last ten years, along with the Sugarhoods.

A post mortem will be carried out later today ascertain the exact cause of death for Mr Harris.

Paphos is notorious for its strong currents and there are several deaths in the coastal resort every year, despite efforts by the authorities to warn swimmers of the dangers.

The port city remains one of the island's biggest tourist attractions with more than 2million people visiting every year, almost half of them British.

A spokeswoman for the Foreign Office said: 'We can confirm the deaths of two British nationals on November 4 in Cyprus. We are providing consular assistance at this difficult time.'
