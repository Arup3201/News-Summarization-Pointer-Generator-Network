A proposed wind farm on the rugged moors that inspired the Bronte sisters has been banned after the area's literary significance was taken into consideration.

Plans to erect turbines on the West Yorkshire countryside that inspired Wuthering Heights have been met with significant criticism from campaigners.

Bradford Council has halted plans for a development entailing a 15m turbine at Hardnaze Farm, Oxenhope, near Haworth, where the Bronte sisters grew up.

Planners have put the sisters’ literary legacy before the Government’s green energy agenda in what is thought to have been the first decision of its kind.

The area attracts visitors from around
the world wanting to see the moorland views that inspired much of the 
Bronte’s finest writing.

More than a dozen applications for
turbines have been submitted to Bradford Council in the past year, on 
top of the plans approved by neighbouring Calderdale for Ovenden Moor.

But now Bradford Council planners have
ruled that the scheme would do little to boost renewable energy - while
creating a blot on Bronte country.

Sally McDonald, chairman of The Bronte
Society Council, said: 'The Bronte Society has objected to a 
number of wind farm proposals this year on the grounds of skyline 
pollution and the potential for damage these towering structures have on
the tourist economy of the area.

'This decision by Bradford Council in 
respect of the single turbine in Oxenhope gives support to the Bronte 
Society’s argument that this is a special and unique landscape and that 
this landscape needs to be protected.

Literary: The development proposed 15 wind turbines but planners took into account the area's literary significance

She added: 'Visitors journey from around the 
world come to see the wild moors of Emily Bronte’s Wuthering Heights and
want to see high waving heather - not high waving turbines.

'I am delighted by this decision and 
that all future applications will have to take into account the 
importance of the historical and literary associations of the area.'

The planning ruling states: 'The 
proposed development would introduce an incongruous and widely visible 
vertical element into this sensitive upland landscape, whose historical 
and literary associations are also central to its wider economic value 
in tourism terms.

Inspiration: The West Yorkshire moors are thought to have provided the inspiration for Emily Bronte's classic novel Wuthering Heights

'The proposed turbine would be seen 
from a number of vantage points and would result in significant harm to 
the character of the landscape that would outweigh its limited 
contribution towards overall renewable energy targets.'

Officers also felt the turbine could 
harm the area’s wildlife being located just 210 metres from the South 
Pennine Moors Special Protection Area.

Campaigners are also concerned about plans for four 
328ft high turbines next to a popular tourist trail.

The £12million scheme, proposed by green energy 
firm Banks Renewables, would see two turbines flanking each side of the 
Brontk Way on Thornton Moor.

Mrs McDonald believes the planning agenda has now changed and developers may have no choice but to back down.

She said: 'The decision will surely make a difference to outcome of future applications. But the grounds on which it has been 
refused are the same grounds as the Bronte Society put forward in 2012 -
without any success - for much larger schemes.

'In making this decision, Bradford acknowledges for the first time the importance of the unique landscape to the area.

'We are delighted the council is 
leading the way such that surely any future applications will also have 
to take into account ‘the importance of the historical and literary 
associations of the area.'

Bronte Society heritage and conservation officer Christine Went said: 'It is good they have acknowledged the importance of this heritage landscape, and internationally renowned heritage area.

'We’ve been arguing for some time that turbines have a negative impact on this landscape.'
