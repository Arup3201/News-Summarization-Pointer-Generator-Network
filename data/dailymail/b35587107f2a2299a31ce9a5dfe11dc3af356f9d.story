A humble family brewery started just six years ago has soared to the very top after scooping an award for producing the best beer in the world.

Frothingham Best shook off strong competition from all over the world, including from the United States, 
Canada, Germany, France and Japan.

It took the top spot in the under five per cent category of the World Beer Awards.

Award-winning: Frothingham Best 4.3% bitter tastes better than anything on the planet, although Matthew Hodgson admits he forget they entered

But bosses Great Newsome Brewery in South Frodingham, East Yorkshire, admit the prestigious accolade was a double shock, because they could not remember entering,

Great Newsome Brewery Director, Matthew Hodgson, said: 'I am still pinching myself.

'It's been a bit of a shock and we have all been very surprised.

'It comes after six years of very hard work so it's incredibly rewarding.'

The family-run brewery put forward two of their beers to the competition, but actually forgot they had entered until they found out they had won.

'We have been going for six and a half years and we are a small family business but have been growing ever since, Mr Hodgson said.

'It's the first time we have ever entered a competition of this magnitude and to think a small brewery in the depths of East Yorkshire can beat competition from all over the world is unbelievable.'

There were 600 entries made to the World Beer Awards from across 30 countries.

Great Newsome Brewery uses ingredients from its coastal fields close to Hull.

Four generations of the family have grown crops on its Great Newsome Farm but the brewery started in May 2007.

It was set up following extensive research on the local and regional real ale market and peoples growing awareness of locally produced food and drink. Â 

Keeping with the family tradition the brewery proudly boasts the English Springer Spaniel Jem as their logo.

Jem
can be seen keeping her eye on a pint of ale, which came about due to 
her life passion of staring into holes, puddles and ponds for hours on end.

She became a popular feature of the brewery until she passed away at the age of 14 in 2010.

To commemorate her life, the Hodgson family named April's seasonal ale after her, as it was brewed on the day she died.

Each was blind-tasted by a panel of carefully selected judges under the guidance of respected beer writer and journalist Roger Protz.

Judges commented on the orange notes of the palate and the sour start and smooth malts Frothingham Best has.

They also described a good sweet bitter balance and good bitter finish.

Matthew said: 'The secret is trying to be as consistent as possible.

'There are lots of small breweries around and we have really tried to be as good as we can be and listen to what out customers say.

'Our head brewer was on holiday when we won the title so it was great news to tell him.

'We're a close knit team so it was a great achievement for all of us. We are all chuffed to bits with it.'

The Great Newsome Brewery supplies their beer right across the UK and also now have a client in Italy.

A dark amber best bitter, Frothingham Best has been brewed since 2008 and is available in both a bottle and as a cast beer.

The beer has been recognised before, gaining a silver award in its category in the 2009 Society of Independent Brewers Awards and Highly Commended in the Yorkshire's Finest Taste in 2011.

Well-earned drink: Matthew Hodgson pours some beer, which beat competition from all over the world to win top prize

'It's the best beer for people who haven't had our beers before or for those who don't drink a huge amount of real ale,' Matthew added.

'We get a lot of interest from the USA due to our unusual names and during the Olympics people asked us to send it to where they were staying.

'We now regularly deliver to pubs, farm shops, restaurants and clubs.'
