Strictly Come Dancing 2014 champion Pasha Kovalev is the star attraction as P&O Cruises have announced their 2015 line-up for their special themed voyages. 

Dancing alongside the Russian professional will be fellow 2014 Strictly finalists Karen Hauer, Kevin Clifton and Kristina Rihanoff.

In 2015, P&O Cruises has four dedicated Strictly Come Dancing themed cruises, in partnership with BBC Worldwide Ltd. 

Pasha Kovalev and Caroline Flack were the winners of Strictly Come Dancing 2014 - and the former will be part of P&O Cruises professional dance line-up

Each cruise will feature four of the show's favourite professional dancers with the opportunity to meet them and maybe learn a move or two from the experts themselves during the regular dance classes. 

Also joining each cruise will be a guest judge, and a special celebrity guest to offer a Strictly experience to remember.

P&O Cruises marketing director Christopher Edgington said: 'Our Strictly cruises really do capture the magic of the Strictly experience. We get superb feedback from everyone who joins in the lessons and watches the incredible professional dancers perform.

The Strictly dancers will be joining passengers on a selection of P&O cruise ships in 2015

'In 2015 we will have a fantastic line up making it an all round fabulous holiday.' 

The Strictly stars will offer up close and personal interviews on board, photo and meet and greet opportunities, and spectacular Strictly Come Dancing showcase performances produced by BBC Worldwide.

P&O will also be joined again on all cruises by a team from DanceSport International, official designers and suppliers of dresses and costumes to the show: a stunning selection of these costumes will be on display around the ship, and available to buy, with organised fashion events to showcase them at their very best.

Passengers can also participate in a dance competition culminating in grand finale performances in the ship's main theatre, with a judging panel including the Strictly celebrity and guest judge.
