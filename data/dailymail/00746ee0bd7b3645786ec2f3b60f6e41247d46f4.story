The adventure takes six months and involves dinner at 109 restaurants.

The couple will get to enjoy dishes such as Salmon Poached in a Liquorice Gel at The Fat Duck in Bray, Berkshire and Arzak’s pineapple bubbles in the mountainous Basque country, as well as the delicacies of legendary chef Alain Ducasse in Monaco.

Visiting approximately one restaurant every other day, the couple will have time to savour their spectacular culinary experiences while taking in the local sites of each destination.
