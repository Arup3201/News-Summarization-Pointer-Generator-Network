It must be the way His Royal Highness tells them.

Prince Charles found Cara Delevingne a more than receptive audience for his jokes as the pair chatted in the gardens of Clarence House.

The 20-year-old model was among the guests at an event thrown by the Prince and his wife in support of conservation charity the Elephant Family last night.

Extending her hand for Charles to take, she apologised that he could see the inking of a lion on her finger and her initials – CJD – on her hand, which she had done by a tattoo artist only recently.

Charles exchanged jokes with Miss Delevingne before she cheekily asked him: ‘Do you have any tattoos?’

He laughed off the question before she informed him she had the words ‘Made in England’ inked on an unidentified part of her body.

Meanwhile, Charles showed that his love of embracing all manner of exotic outfits is not confined to his trips abroad.

He and the Duchess of Cornwall sported animal masks, with Camilla keeping strictly to the theme in a sparkling elephant mask, while Charles opted for a golden design featuring a prancing tiger.

In fits: Delevingne laughs loudly while her sister Poppy does not seem to find it as amusing

At first the prince struggled to see under his mask, laughing: ‘I am slightly anxious about this thing, I can’t see a thing.’

Miss Delevingne was joined by her elder sister Poppy, 26, also a successful model, at the gardens of Charles’s official London residence for the reception.

The royal couple spent about an hour chatting to some of their 400 guests, who sported a variety of extravagant headdresses at the masked ball.

But he will not be accompanied to the Jerudong Trophy at Cirencester Park Polo Club by his wife, who will stay in her London ‘safety zone’ so close to her due date.
