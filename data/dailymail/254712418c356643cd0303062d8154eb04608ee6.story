This little boy has some serious moves.

The adorable two year old, called Tegan, was recorded putting his best foot forward as he danced to  dubstep  outside of his house.

Though many struggle to move to the genre's beats on the dance floor, this little guy has absolutely nailed it.

Uploaded to YouTube by Pro Flo, the clip has already garnered almost 1 million views

Tegan's talent is perhaps unsurprising given the fact that his father is a dancer, as well.

That's probably where the tot first heard Adventure Club's remix of 'Crave You' by Flight Facilities, which is the song he's dancing to in the clip.

Uploaded to YouTube by user Pro Flo from California, the boy's impressive technique has since been viewed almost one million times.

All in the family: Tegan's father is also a dancer, so presumably that's where he learned some of his moves
