A pair of brothers in Adelaide have created an online video of an epic Nerf gun battle that is worthy of any action movie.

Posted just two days ago, the video has attracted more than 600,000 views on YouTube in 48 hours.

To make it more realistic, Danny and Michael Philippou used tomato sauce as fake blood along with editing in gun sounds and sparks when a shot is fired off.

Two Adelaide brothers have made a YouTube video of an epic Nerf gun battle

In just 48 hours, the three-minute video has attracted more than 600,000 views

The three-minute video starts off innocently enough with two men sitting on the living room couch playing with their mobile phones.

But suddenly one of them is hit with a Nerf bullet on his chest from a gun that is off-camera. 

It cuts to three other man standing in the corner of the room - one of them aiming a Nerf gun at the friends sitting on the couch - who burst out laughing.

The disgruntled friend is not amused, saying: 'I'm not in the mood, Michael.'

The video is dubbed with gun sounds, dramatic music and tomato sauce is used as fake blood

It is also features an explosion where a bullet hits a container of petrol

A slow-motion bullet dodge - similar to the one seen in The Matrix movie - is also included

But his lack of enthusiasm is lost on the men terrorising him who continue to attack him and the other man on the couch.

Suddenly more Nerf guns start to appear and more shots are fired.

To throw people off the coming action sequence, one of the men becomes the voice of reason, saying: 'Alright guys, stop, someone's going to get hurt.'

But the camera cuts away to one of the group who pulls out two Nerf guns as dramatic music plays to build tension.

Then a spray of bullets ensues complete with James Bond-style dives behind furniture, runs across the dining room table and dramatic slides over the kitchen counter.

The video also includes a slow motion bullet dodge - a nod to the iconic The Matrix movie scene - and an explosion.

The two brothers who directed and edited the video were Danny and Michael Philippou

One of the five men in the video holds a comrade in his arms who is 'dying'

To avenge his friend, he engages in an epic sword battle with another man

One of them accidentally sets off a gun and they use their weapons to deflect the bullets

The sword fight ends with both of them stabbing each other in the chest

The group of five then engage in hand-to-hand combat as the situation escalates along with the music.

Then the ultimate weapon is brought out - a machine gun-style Nerf gun - wielded by a man imitating Arnold Schwarzenegger a la The Terminator.

The group continue to cause a raucous and destruction through out the house, and the video peaks with one of them clutching a brother-in-arms covered in blood after he is shot and then dies.

The friend then seeks revenge for his comrade's death.

A Nerf machine gun is produced and a spray of bullets rains over the living room

Paying tribute to James Bond, the men dive over the kitchen bench and run across the dining room table 

Two women - presumably residents of the home - appear and join in on the action

This pits two of the men against each other in an epic sword battle where one is armed with a Nerf blade and the other with a mop.

At one point during the clash of metals, one of them sets off a Nerf gun and - using their weapons - they deflect the bullets, sending them ricocheting across the room at each other.

It ends with both of them stabbing each other as two women - who are presumably the residents of the house - walk in, exclaiming about the mess.

The older woman asks them what they are doing and they tell her they are 'playing Nerf'. 

But in a strange turn of events the woman opens her coat to reveal an arsenal of weapons and says: 'Let's dance.'

It ends with both women screaming and running into the living room, brandishing weapons.
