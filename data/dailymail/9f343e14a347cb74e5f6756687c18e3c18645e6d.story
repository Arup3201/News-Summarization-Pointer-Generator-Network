Virgins in one of Africa's poorest countries are being offered £11 a month to abstain from sex, it has been reported.

Swaziland's playboy King, Mswati III, has reportedly approved the benefits scheme in a bid to curb HIV across the state.

But critics claim  the flamboyant ruler - who already has 15 wives - is simply trying to ensure any future brides are disease-free.

Swazi virgins are seen here during a Reed Dance ceremony during which the King, Mswati III, chooses a future bride. Young girls are being offered £11 a month to abstain from sex 

Details have to be established about how the girls will be monitored to ensure they are not having sex.

Swazi virgins usually only hit the headlines when tens of thousands of them dance topless before the king at the annual Reed Dance.

Each year the 46-year old, sub-Saharan Africa's last absolute monarch, chooses a virgin as his new wife from the ceremony.

Last month, he selected a 19-year-old to be his 15th wife.

The programme, reportedly financed by the World Bank, will offer girls a substantial income in a country where two-thirds of the population earn less than 60p a day.

Thabsile Dlamini, a health care worker in the city of Manzini, told South African website IOL: 'The government will pay girls the allowances so they will have money to purchase necessities and can turn down money offered to them for sex.'

HIV transmission rates in Swaziland currently stand at 26 per cent, one of the highest in the world.

But teenagers say the money is not enough to stop them accepting gifts and money in exchange for sex. 

Thandi Tfwala, 17, said: 'A girl could get R200 (£11) for just one sex act.

'You don't know Swazi girls. If they don't get more money, they will keep on doing what they do now.

'Our king will have to go to Cape Town for his brides.'
