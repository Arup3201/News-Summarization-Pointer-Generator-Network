A 54-year-old divorcee who admits she was 'stupid' for falling for a Turkish toyboy who left her broken-hearted and down £16,000, says she's 'taking a risk' on a new young lover.

Tracy Lockett, from Manchester, fell for Bulent Dohan, 31, after meeting him online but their relationship turned sour after she said he kept asking her for money.

The final straw came when she lent him £2,000 which she never got back.

Tracy fell for Bulent after meeting him online but when they met up, she ended up footing the bill. She says she spent £16,000 during the course of their relationship

But despite her bad experience, she is now in a new relationship with another Turkish man - Aziz - who is also years younger than she is.

But she insists she won't be conned again.

'I've met someone new, he's totally different to Bulent,' she told Channel 5 show Love Rats Abroad. 'He can't do enough for me, he's besotted with me, he has never asked for money.  

'I am taking a risk but I'm going in with my eyes open this time.'

Tracy's willingness to put her heart on the line again is surprising given her previous ordeal.

She reveals on the documentary how she met Bulent, from south east Turkey, online in 2009, ten years after she'd divorced.

'I was happy being single so I wasn't looking for love. Within weeks he was telling me he loved me, I had strong feelings for him too, it felt right so I went out to meet him,' she said.

The pair arranged to go on holiday together in Istanbul and Tracy said at first it was a dream come true. 

Tracy said she lent her toyboy £2,000 which she wants back - but he thought it was a gift

'He made me feel good, he made me feel alive again. The fact he was younger, at the back of my mind I thought "yeah I can still pull".'

But she said that despite Bulent having a job as a dialysis technician, she was having to pay for everything. 

She explained: 'He didn't have that much money to spend so I ended up paying for most things. It came to the crunch one night when he said "I need your help, I don't have the money to get home." 

'So I had to buy his plane tickets home for him and I never got that money back.'

Tracy returned to the UK and as their long distance relationship continued, she said Bulent kept asking her to send him money.

'Over three years I went to see him, I spent more than £16,000 and it could have been more if it went on longer,' she said.

The relationship ended when Tracy suspected he was seeing another woman. But before that day came, she'd also sent him £2,000 which she said he wanted for a kebab shop licence.

Tracy thought it was a loan but Bulent viewed it as a gift - and so has not paid her back. He said he tried to break off the relationship with Tracy numerous times but she wouldn't let him.

He is now married and says he wants Tracy to leave him alone once and for all. 

But Tracy is insistent on fighting to get the £2,000 loan back.

The divorcee admitted on Channel 5 show Love Rats Abroad that she was 'stupid' 

She said: 'I trusted this guy, I gave him a chance and now I believe he was stringing me along getting what he could. It's not about the money, it's the principle.'

Tracy has met with the deputy head of City of London Police's Action Fraud and Turkish authorities to try and get Bulent to pay her back. 

Her efforts so far have proved fruitless and she has been advised her next step would be to launch criminal proceedings - but this would involve expensive legal costs.

Tracy believes she is not alone in being duped out of money by a so called love rat.

'My story is the same as many more, I run a Facebook group and so many tell the same story of a man they met at the beach or in a bar and they fell into same trap.

'I thought I was astute and intelligent but for some reason they take over. It made me irrational. I was stupid, everyone thinks their guy is different.'

Despite saying this, Tracy herself says her new man, Aziz is 'different' and they have already talked of marriage.

Tracy is now in a new relationship with Turkish toyboy Aziz and insists 'he's different'

It's a situation Elaine, 48, from Yorkshire, also found herself him when she married Turkish husband Adam Gula, 27, in 2007.

'I thought this is my Mr Right who I have been waiting for all my life,' Elaine told Love Rats Abroad.

'He was like Prince Charming, he treated me like a lady.'

The pair met on a night out in the UK in 2003.   

Elaine recalls: 'I was on a girls' night out and saw him across dance floor. We had a drink and he said he was looking for an older woman, that was it, the start of our relationship. 

'I was attracted to his dark hair, dark eyes and he had a nice body, I was happy, over the moon.'

Elaine, 48, from Yorkshire, had her heart broken by her Turkish ex-husband

Elaine said husband Adam was like Prince Charming when they first met but their relationship deteriorated after they married

Elaine discovered Adam was in the country because he had a visa obtained by marrying an English woman he had met while she was on holiday in Turkey.

Elaine said she wasn't suspicious as to why the relationship hadn't lasted long after they had married and Adam had moved to the UK.

'He said they didn't stay together because as soon as he came into the country, she changed,' Elaine said.

Following Adam's divorce, he asked Elaine to marry him.

She was delighted and they tied the knot in Turkey where she spent their honeymoon meeting his family and friends.

According to his wife, Adam walked out days after his new passport arrived

But on returning to the UK, Elaine said the fairy tale was over and they 'lived like strangers'. 

After three years, Adam then left her - days after his new passport arrived. 

'I was headbutting walls, I was hysterical and in shock,' Elaine said of the day Adam left. 'I really loved him, it was terrible.'

She said she has struggled to put what happened behind her and has felt depressed ever since.

She said: 'He caught me with my guard down, I was too trusting. He came across as such a lovely person but it was a big mistake.'
