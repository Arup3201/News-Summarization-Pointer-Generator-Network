Former basketball star Dennis Rodman apologized on Monday for not being able to help an American missionary detained in North Korea during his trip there to play in a game to celebrate the birthday of his friend and leader Kim Jong Un.

'I'm sorry, I'm sorry I couldn't do anything,' Rodman told media on his arrival at Beijing airport from a weeklong trip. 'It's not my fault. I'm sorry. I just want to do some good stuff, that's all I want to do.'

Rodman and the squad of retired NBA players he took to North Korea for an exhibition game marking Kim's birthday have met with criticism in the U.S. because of North Korea's human rights record and its development of nuclear weapons.

Apology:  Dennis Rodman said Monday that he's 'sorry' about the situation inside North Korea, but that his recent visit there with a team of fellow former NBA players was an attempt to do something good

The 52-year-old angered many people in the United States with an interview last week in which he implied that Kenneth Bae, a U.S. missionary imprisoned by North Korea, was to blame for his incarceration rather than authorities there.

Rodman, who calls himself a friend of North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, apologised for the comments made during his visit to North Korea with a group of fellow U.S. basketball players.

Rodman was met by a throng of media as he made his way, flanked by burly bodyguards, through the airport terminal to a waiting car.

'I want to tell people that no matter what's going on in the world, for one day, just one day, not politics, not all this stuff,' he said.

'I'm not the president, I'm not an ambassador, I'm Dennis Rodman, just an individual, just showing the world a fact that we can actually get along and be happy for one day.'

Rodman was also slammed for not using 
his influence with Kim to help free Kenneth Bae, the missionary in poor 
health who has been detained for more than a year for 'anti-state 
crimes.'

Rodman apologized last week for comments he made in a CNN 
interview implying Bae was at fault, saying he had been drinking and was
 upset because some of his teammates were leaving under pressure.

On
 Monday, Rodman reiterated that his trip - in which he sang 'Happy 
Birthday' to Kim before playing the exhibition game at a Pyongyang 
stadium - was one of goodwill.

Relationship: Rodman has described Kim, whose once powerful uncle was recently purged and executed, as a friend and a 'very good guy.'

Rodman appeared to be overcome with emotion and seemed to start crying as he moved away from the media, repeating 'I'm sorry'.

Rodman expressed regret over the interview on Thursday in which he implied Bae was to blame for his imprisonment, saying he had been feeling emotional after drinking.

Bae, 45, was sentenced to 15 years of hard labour for state subversion in North Korea, where he was detained in 2012 while leading a tour group.

North Korea's Supreme Court said he used his tourism business to form groups aimed at overthrowing the government.

Rodman
 and Kim struck up a friendship when the 
basketball-player-turned-celebrity first traveled to the secretive state
 last year.

On Monday, Rodman expressed his thanks to 'the Marshal', which is Kim's official title, for enabling his visit.

'It's amazing that I had the opportunity just to go to North Korea, and for the Marshal to give me an opportunity just to be in his presence in the city,' he said. 'This is not a bad deal.'

Rodman had staged a basketball match in the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, to commemorate Kim's birthday, drawing the ire of human rights activists. He also visited a ski resort in the isolated state.

Rodman led a chorus of North Koreans in a rendition of 'Happy Birthday' to Kim.

The fading basketball star's trips had previously been financed by Irish bookmaker Paddy Power, although it has now withdrawn its funding.
