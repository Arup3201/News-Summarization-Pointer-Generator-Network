She has already proved her athletic prowess with tough physical challenges including a 50-mile endurance race. And yesterday Pippa Middleton upped the stakes by joining one of the toughest cross-country skiing events in the world.

The 28-year-old – who had never done any cross-country skiing before – braved sub-zero temperatures during the 56-mile challenge in Western Sweden.

But in order to make sure she would be ready for the contest, Ms Middleton engaged in a series of last-minute training sessions to brush up on her technique.

Beginner: Cross-country novice Pippa arrived in Sweden a week ahead of the race to get in some practice

Arriving in Sweden a week before the race, Pippa and her brother James got kitted out with skis and poles and hit the snow to get to grips with the discipline.

Already a keen skier, Pippa was at ease with the equipment - but nonetheless struggled to keep her balance on some of the course's more challenging parts.

She looked determined to master the art, spending her time ahead of the race practising the rhythmic swinging of the arms and smooth leg movements necessary for the kind of efficient and high-speed skiing style needed to earn her a decent place in the pecking order.

The arduous training more than paid off in the end, as Pippa managed to secure an impressive 412th place out of 15,800 racers when the race went ahead on the weekend.

After the race, one local who hands the winner a wreath, proved 
the envy of many men when he planted a kiss on her cheek at the end of the 
course.

The Duchess of Cambridge’s younger 
sister joined 15,800 other skiers for the race between Salen and Mora, 
including her brother James.

But sweating it out on skis did not mean her exacting sartorial standards had to slip.

Miss Middleton, who turned up with immaculate hair and make-up, started 
the race with a white hat but ended it in a fetching orange one, which she co-ordinated with her sunglasses and shoes.

She crossed the finish line after seven hours, 13 minutes and 36 seconds – described by veterans as a ‘very impressive’ time.

When asked if she minded finishing 26 minutes behind her brother, she replied: ‘No, that was probably fair.’

Despite being a beginner at cross country skiing, Pippa marched powerfully along the tough course

Pippa was a natural on the course, onlookers said

The party planner explained she had ‘never really skied cross-country 
before’, but said she and James, 23, had done ‘lots of fitness training’
in the UK to prepare for the race, as well as two weekends spent skiing
in Switzerland.

During the race – much of which was uphill – Miss Middleton stopped to 
drink the local blabarsoppa, or blueberry soup,  a drink handed out to 
racers which is said to boost energy.

Per Strid, a spokesman for the Vasaloppet race, one of the oldest events
of its kind in the world, said: ‘I must congratulate Pippa – she had a 
fantastic performance. What she achieved was really impressive for a 
first timer. She was obviously very fit and in very good shape.’

The Middletons were raising money for the Magic Breakfast charity, which
provides a pre-school meal to poor inner-city children in the UK. So 
far they have raised nearly £7,500 for the cause.
