Jordan Spieth will continue his quest for Masters glory when he tees off his third round at Augusta at 2:55pm local time (7:55pm BST) on Saturday.

The 21-year-old American holds a five-shot lead at the half-way stage after a record 14 under par opening two rounds, and he will be joined in Saturday's final pairing by Charley Hoffman, who is on nine under par.

Leading Brits Justin Rose and Paul Casey, both in a tie for third with Dustin Johnson on seven under par, will tee off at 2:45pm (7:45pm BST) and 2:35pm (7:35pm BST) respectively.

Rory McIlroy and Tiger Woods, meanwhile, will be out a lot earlier in the day at Augusta as they both bid to make up ground on their 12-shot deficit to leader Spieth.

The Northern Irishman will be on course at 12:45pm (5:45pm BST) with reigning Masters champion Bubba Watson.

Woods, meanwhile, will be joined by Sergio Garcia when he tees off at 1:15pm (6:15pm BST)
