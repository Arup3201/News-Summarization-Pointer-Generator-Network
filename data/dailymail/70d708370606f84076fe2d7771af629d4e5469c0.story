It sounds like the kind of crazy creation you'd expect to emerge from the kitchens of Heston Blumenthal or Marco Pierre White, but this black bamboo and squid ink burger is actually the work of fast-food giant Burger King.

The chain's Japanese franchises will offer the pitch black patty from September 28 to mark its fifth anniversary in the land of the rising sun.

The buns are made from dough mixed with bamboo charcoal, and between them is paprika and tomato beef...slathered with black squid ink ketchup.

'Overturning preconceptions': Burger King's kuro burger is made with bamboo charcoal and squid ink

Costing 790yen (£6.25) with fries and a drink, the creation has been imaginatively dubbed the 'kuro', or 'black' burger.

But perhaps the 'Ninja' would be a better name, since Burger King says it is intended to 'punch you in the mouth with taste'.

The chain wants to 'overturn the preconceptions of what constitutes a fast food burger'.

It's not the first time they've challenged convention. Their 2012 summer menu included an ice cream sundae flavoured with vanilla, fudge, caramel and bacon.

Fast food chains are having to adapt their menus to suit tastes in emerging markets, with McDonalds planning a vegetarian restaurant in the Sikh holy city of Amritsar, India.

The world-leader in fast food has itself experimented with black burgers for the Asian market, introducing a meal in China featuring a pair of buns - one black, one white.

Available for a limited time only, the kuro will be staying in Japan. A spokesman for Burger King UK said there are no plans to add it to the menus in their British restaurants.
