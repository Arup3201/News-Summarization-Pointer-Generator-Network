British workers risk becoming ‘unemployable’ because EU red tape means foreign firms will take their business elsewhere, David Cameron warned today.

The Prime Minister launched a sustained attack on Brussels, claiming Eurocrats fear if they do not produce more rules and regulations they are ‘not doing their job’.

He urged global firms to bring jobs back to Britain, but warned that ‘complex and overwritten directives’ impose such heavy burdens on business that those looking to relocate will opt for countries outside the EU.

Warning: David Cameron launched a push to attract more customers to bring jobs back to Britain but warned they would be deterred by excessive EU regulations

Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Mr Cameron launched a drive to reverse the trend of ‘offshoring’, which has seen thousands of British jobs shifted to low-cost countries in the East over recent years.

He argued that cheap energy from shale gas and less red tape could be key to attracting firms to move posts back to the UK.

He said it was wrong to write-off western countries told they cannot compete with cheap labour overseas, but warned the European Union it will prevent jobs returning to the continent if it imposed excessive and unnecessary rules.

Progress had been made in curbing the impact of Brussels but ‘the fight is not yet won’, Mr Cameron said.

He added: ‘There are still people who think that the key to success is ever greater social protections and more regulations.

‘Some in the European Commission seem to think that if they’re not producing new regulations they’re somehow not doing their job and that removing existing regulations is somehow an act of self-harm, while many in the European Parliament are tempted to gold plate every piece of legislation.

‘Let’s be clear. We don’t protect workers by piling on the regulations and directives to such an extent that they become unemployable.

‘We have to maintain the flexibility for companies to grow and expand.

‘Incredibly complex and overwritten directives that take this flexibility away, that make life difficult for temporary workers, or that stop firms moving people between plants just mean that companies who want to re-shore will re-shore somewhere else.’

The Prime Minister yesterday visited the headquarters of ventilation manufacturer, Vent-Axia in Crawley, East Sussex which has recently created 26 new jobs by moving production back to the UK from China

He also issued a warning to Brussels not to stand in the way of Britain exploiting its reserves of shale gas through the controversial practice of fracking.

The Premier said the prospect of developing ‘cheap and predictable’ energy sources could help to attract back to the Europe jobs which had been ‘off-shored’ to the rising economic powers of Asia.

But he warned that the opportunities presented by shale gas - which had helped transform the US economy - could be undermined if the European Union sought to impose unnecessary new regulations.

‘To relocate in Europe, businesses will be encouraged by cheap and predictable sources of energy,’ he said.

‘We should be clear that if the European Union or its member states impose burdensome, unjustified or premature regulatory burdens on shale gas exploration in Europe investors will quickly head elsewhere.

‘Oil and gas will still be plentifully produced, but Europe will be dry.’

Mr Cameron also warned that Britain could miss out on the benefits of fracking if European legislation failed to keep pace with the rest of the world

According to Government figures, some 1,500 manufacturing jobs have already come back to the UK since 2011.

Today ministers launched a new service called Reshore UK to help firms which want to do the same.

Mr Cameron admitted that companies will still move production facilities to countries like India and China but he insisted that the West should not be ‘written off’.

Citing recent research which found that one in 10 small and medium-sized businesses have brought production back to the UK over the last year - twice as many as have sent it abroad - he will said that reshoring could become ‘a fresh driver of growth in Europe’ and Britain should take advantage of the trend.

He added: ‘For years the West has been written off. People say that we are facing some sort of inevitable decline. They say we can't make anything any more.

‘Whether it's the shift from manufacturing to services or the transfer from manual jobs to machines, the end point is the same dystopian vision - the East wins while the West loses; and the workers lose while the machines win. I don't believe it has to be this way.’
