Sharon Osbourne and a host of other celebrities are coming together to 'show solidarity' in the national fundraising campaign Stand Up To Cancer.

The joint Cancer Research UK and Channel 4 campaign aims to accelerate new treatments to cancer patients, and the list of celebrities - each with their own personal reasons for getting involved - includes Osbourne, Davina McCall, Christine Bleakley and Alan Carr.

Former X Factor judge Osbourne, who has battled cancer herself, said: 'Having had personal experience of cancer, I know first-hand the devastating effect it can have on a person and their friends and family.

'But we can't sit there and let cancer take control of our lives - the more of us who show solidarity and Stand Up To Cancer together, the faster we can fight this deadly disease.'

Osbourne previously revealed she had undergone a double mastectomy.

The 61-year-old beat colon cancer over a decade ago but opted for surgery after finding she carried a gene which increased the risk of developing breast cancer. 

Speaking from experience: Sharon Osbourne, 61, is joining the campaign because she has battled cancer herself and says she knows first-hand the devastating effect it can have on a person and their friends and family

Family matters: Davina McCall, who lost her sister to cancer in 2012, is hosting Stand Up To Cancer's live TV show on Channel 4 on Friday October 17

Speaking up: Chat show host and comedian Alan Carr, whose friend suffered from throat cancer, will also be presenting the live TV show

Meanwhile, presenter McCall, who lost her sister to cancer in 2012, is returning to host Stand Up To Cancer's live TV show on Channel 4 on Friday October 17.

She said: 'I'm Standing Up To Cancer because my big sister Caroline had primary lung cancer, and because she was frightened of doctors, and kept making excuses, by the time we got to A&E she was given a terminal diagnosis.

'I don't think that anybody should be told in A&E that they're not going to make it. I hope that by Standing Up To Cancer and raising funds and awareness maybe one other person will go to the doctor and get themselves checked, get diagnosed earlier, and make it.'

Getting involved: DJ Greg James, left, and funny man Jake Whitehall are also joining the Stand Up To Cancer movement, which aims to raise lots of money to find cures as soon as possible

Joining in: The Inbetweeners star Blake Harrison, left, and Dr Christian Jessen, right, are supporting the charity campaign; the live TV show airs on Channel 4 on Friday October 17

Chat show host and comedian Alan Carr, whose friend suffered from throat cancer, will also be presenting the live TV show.

He said: 'My very good friend Sam lost her voice box to throat cancer and I saw how low she got, not being able to talk, but I see now how confident she is. To think she might not be here if it wasn't for funding, funding, funding.

'Joining the Stand Up To Cancer movement is something we can all do. Let's hope we can get loads and loads of money to find cures as soon as possible.'

Other celebrities taking part include Saturdays singer Una Foden, Dr Christian Jessen, radio DJ Greg James, designer Henry Holland, comedian Jack Whitehall, presenter Jake Humphrey and The Inbetweeners star Blake Harrison.
