Jaguar will go retro when it unveils its 'new' model tomorrow - a revived E-Type race car which will cost wealthy collectors $1.7million.

The legendary E-Type from the 1960s is the Jaguar's best-known car and the Lightweight model is its most sought-after.

Only 12 of the 18 planned cars were ever built between 1963 and 1964 - and earlier this year Jaguar stunned the auto industry by announcing they were to build the remaining six.

Jaguar will unveil the revived E-Type Lighweight model race car in Pebble Beach, California, tomorrow which will cost wealthy collectors $1.7million

Between 1963 and 1964, just 12 of the 18 planned E-Type Lightweight model race cars were ever built - with Jaguar stunning the auto industry this year by announcing plans to build the remaining six

The manufacturer, fresh from announcing profits of $16million per day will unveil the beautiful new model in Pebble Beach, California tomorrow.

Each of the six cars will be built to a specification originated from the last Lightweight E-type produced in 1964.

The cars, which won't be road legal, will be hand-crafted at the original home of the E-type, Jaguar's Browns Lane plant in Coventry, England, as part of Jaguar Heritage's first recreation project.

Under the aluminium body is a 3.8-litre engine which will develop around 340bhp. With the right gearing, the E-Type will be capable of more than 160mph.

Each new E-Type will be powered by a recreated version of the original XK-based straight-six engine, with an aluminium block, a ‘wide angle’ aluminium cylinder head, and a dry sump lubrication system

John Edwards, managing director, Jaguar Land Rover Special Operations which runs the Heritage side, described the E-Type as 'an incredibly exciting project'.

He said: 'Special Operations' remit is to indulge our most discerning and enthusiastic customers' passion for our cars - including those from our past.

'This is why our Jaguar Heritage division exists. The E-type is an iconic car, and the Lightweight E-type the most desirable of all.

'To be able to complete the intended production run of 18, some 50 years after the last Lightweight was completed, was an opportunity we couldn't miss.'

Between 1961 and 1975, Jaguar built around 72,500 E-types with the stylish motor regarded as one of the prettiest cars ever built.

For the recreation, Jaguar used state-of-the-art scanning technology to digitally remap the inner and outer surfaces of a Lightweight bodyshell

All of the new E-Types will be built by hand at Jaguar’s new Heritage customer workshop facility, at Browns Lane factory, Coventry, England and all will feature the aluminium body panels that made the lightweight so special at the time

 The car's body has 230 individual components and to accurately reproduce the car, Jaguar recorded dimensions and shape down to a fraction of a millimetre

The Lightweight E-Type was raced by the likes of likes of Graham Hill, Jackie Stewart and Roy Salvadori and now command a $6.6million-plus price-tag.

It was around 114kg lighter than a standard E-type, thanks to its all-aluminium body and engine block, lack of interior trim and exterior chrome work and a host of further weight-saving features including lightweight, hand-operated side windows.

Ian Callum, Director of Design, Jaguar, said: 'With the Lightweight E-type, our focus as a design team has been to ensure justice was done to the original work of Sir William Lyons and Malcolm Sayer.

'Meticulous attention to detail has been everything to us in re-creating this car, just as it is in our contemporary Jaguars.

'I believe the result is a new Lightweight E-type that is as stunning now as the originals would have been when they were new.'

Each new E-Type will be powered by a recreated version of the original XK-based straight-six engine, with an aluminium block, a ‘wide angle’ aluminium cylinder head, and a dry sump lubrication system.

Two fuel injection options will be offered with the new cars and three Weber carburetors will be fitted as standard.

But a Lucas fuel injection system will be available as a cost option. Both variants have been homologated for FIA historic motorsport, and Jaguar says that no matter which fuel injection is chosen, power output will be 'well over 300' bhp. 

All six vehicles will be built as perfect reproductions and to the exact specifications of the original 12 cars first produced in 1963.

Customers will also be able to specify a range of bespoke options for their individual cars.
