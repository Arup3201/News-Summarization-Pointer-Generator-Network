Happier times: Douglas Quinn allegedly beat Elizabeth, seen here at a 2009 event, while they were on a trip to New York earlier this month

The home of the soccer boss who was arrested for allegedly beating up his wife was featured on a home makeover show where the lead decorator singled out issues in the couple’s bedroom.

Douglas Quinn was arrested on November 10 when he was charged by the NYPD for allegedly attacking his wife Elizabeth and suffocating her until she passed out while they were on a weekend trip to Manhattan.

The Quinns are based in Dallas, Texas and their mansion was featured on Bravo’s reality show ‘Million Dollar Decorator’ as host Kathryn Ireland attempted to redo her ‘friends’ home.

Though it is unclear when exactly the episode that aired on Wednesday November 28 was shot, Ms Ireland introduces the project explaining: ‘They've just moved here and I totally helped them redo it’.

Mr Quinn, who has two daughters, was hired by FC Dallas as the president and CEO of the club in 2010, so their recent move must have been within the city.

Looking at the decorations, Ms Ireland likened the wood panelling to the scene of a fire, even though the true sparks flew when the couple went to New York to celebrate his 50th birthday and stayed at the Alex Hotel in midtown.

‘In the master bedroom, my big objective
here was to paint out all of that terrible wood. Frankly to me it 
looked like there'd been a fire. So we painted all of that out 
immediately,’ Ms Ireland said in the show.

A slideshow of photos shows how the decorator decided to paint over a good deal of the home’s dark wood panelling to give a lighter look. In one of the girl’s bedrooms, Ms Ireland used a canopy bed to create a whimsical feel.

When it came to personal touches for 
the couple’s lovenest, she looked back at the couple’s romantic history 
and put a map of Paris above their bed as it was the city where they 
spent their honeymoon.

‘We found this great map and I think what drew both Liz and Doug to it was that it was Paris,’ Ms Ireland said in the segment.

‘They want to feel that they've been part of this journey with you. I'm so so happy with the way it's turned out.’

Even though the renovation of the home may be done, the same cannot be said for the couple’s legal problems, as the football club announced two weeks ago that Doug would be taking ‘an indefinite leave of absence from the club to attend to personal matters.’

The 6ft 5in boss was arrested on charges of assault and strangulation at around 4pm on the Saturday afternoon.

Mrs Quinn, who was taken to New York Hospital and treated for injuries to her face, arm, legs and eye at the weekend, told the New York Post: 'We had a lovely night, and unfortunately things went wrong,' she said, adding that the couple - who have two children - plan to stay together.

Police sources told the newspaper Quinn allegedly hit his wife repeatedly, choked her using both hands, before holding a pillow over her face until she passed out.

Quinn was arrested and later released on $20,000 bail following his arraignment in Manhattan Criminal Court.

Lawyers representing the football boss said in a statement: 'In these cases, which are usually "he said, she said", there is often another side to the story, and there certainly is one here.'
