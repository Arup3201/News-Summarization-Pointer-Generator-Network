This is the dramatic moment one of the engines of an aeroplane carrying more than 300 passengers explodes as it prepares to take off.

The Airbus A330 was taxiing along the runway at Manchester Airport yesterday when its right engine suddenly developed a fault and exploded.

The aircraft had fortunately not yet left the ground and the pilot was able to quickly bring it under control.

The Thomas Cook Airlines flight TCX314 had been carrying 325 passengers to the Dominican Republic at the time of the incident.

A dramatic video posted online shows how the engine suddenly explodes as the plane makes it way down the runway.

A flame can be seen coming from the engine before it begins to billow smoke.

The plane then veers slightly from one side to the other as the pilot swiftly gets the aircraft under control.

Emergency services including three fire engines then attend to the stationary vehicle.

A Thomas Cook Airlines spokesman confirmed an investigation was underway into the incident.

'The aircraft developed an engine fault and returned to stand; as a precaution, the airport emergency services attended the aircraft - but at no time were passengers or crew at risk.

'Weâ€™d like to thank our customers for their patience during the delay to their flight; a replacement aircraft was used to take them on their holiday the same afternoon.'
