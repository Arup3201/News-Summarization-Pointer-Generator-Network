All he wanted was a phone call. According to Rio Ferdinand, the most toxic scandal in the history of the Premier League era could have been avoided if John Terry had just picked up the telephone and apologised.

Yet isn’t that the nub of it? The reason Terry’s foul exchange with Rio’s brother Anton continues to resonate almost three years later is because civil resolution was impossible once the wheels of the modern race scandal began turning.

Rio’s recollection of that time is shaming for British society. Smashed windows, bullets in the post, abuse in the street. His mother was hospitalised with stress. And his family were the victims. Understandably, he feels bitter that Terry appeared without remorse through this turbulent period. Yet it was not as simple as that.

The moment a member of the public complained about what Terry is alleged to have shouted down the pitch on October 23, 2011, communication became impossible. That is the nature of this beast. Other disputes can be resolved with clear-eyed honesty, but the instantaneously sensitive process around race cases ends all hope of a swift or constructive outcome.

In an ideal world, Terry learns, the Ferdinand family receives its apology, examples are set, progress is made. This is not to brush racial politics under the carpet.

The two sides could have been reconciled in the glare of publicity, maybe appeared side by side, taking questions from the floor. It would have been awkward but was the alternative much better? Court cases and FA hearings, resignations and sackings and, at the end, what?

If the incident was repeated at a match next weekend, would English football be any further forward? It would have some nice, statutory punishment procedures in place, but little more.

Education, contrition and growth should be the aim: qualities a little more useful than a 10-game ban.

Everyone has, at some point, spoken in the heat of a moment. Everyone has said something they instantly regret. Nothing as incendiary as the words Terry is accused of uttering. Not racist, but worthy of apology. And that apology can be made, whether immediately or on reflection, in the hope of advancement. We resolve and move on. That is human nature.

Yet that was not the case on October 23. Within hours, under pressure, Terry had his alibi and was sticking to it. Equally, social media had begun driving a news agenda that screamed for action. The authorities responded with intent to prosecute. And that was the point of no return.

Reflecting on the days that followed in his autobiography, Ferdinand is insightful on race issues.

‘The matter should have been sorted quickly in a way that would have allowed everyone, including John Terry, to emerge with dignity,’ he says. Of course, he is right.

That would have been considerably healthier than the saga played out across courtrooms and in the offices of the national association, a scandal that cost the job of the England manager and its captain, and the careers of several footballers. Rio did not play for England again, Terry retired in haste and Anton has not been the same player.

Yet, just as Ferdinand admits in his autobiography that he was under legal instruction not to talk publicly about the case, so Terry would have been under pressure.

He would have received legal counsel, and possibly advice from his club, and they would have been of one voice. Say sorry, they would have told him, and you might as well admit guilt. He was never going to pick up the phone and make that call, once the external clamour began.

Ferdinand apparently sought reconciliation, a chance to talk frankly and to receive honesty in return. Instead, the last direct conversation Terry had with a member of the Ferdinand family took place that fateful Sunday; any other contact was deemed too complex, just at a time when openness, intimacy and sincerity was urgently required.

‘Everyone please just respect each other,’ is Ferdinand’s message now. He almost echoes Rodney King’s plaintive plea during the LA riots. ‘Can we all get along?’ King asked. And we can, mostly. Yet the fall-out from English football’s most poisonous exchange is scant evidence of it. The processes put in place failed miserably and have left English football no further advanced. There is still no legacy beyond bitter recrimination. Nobody learns, nobody grows and nobody says sorry any more.
