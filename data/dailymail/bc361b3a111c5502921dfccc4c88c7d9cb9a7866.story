A biologist from the Bahamas has discovered while that some sharks can be aggressive, others can be 'mellow'.

He said that his evidence points to the existence of a 'personality' in the much maligned fish.

Biologist Jean Sebastien Finger added that it is impossible to generalise the behaviour of one individual to a species.

A study of young Lemon Sharks, like the one pictured, found they have personalities and fish that were novelty-seekers, were less sociable than sharks that played it safe when exploring a new enclosure

In a study of young Lemon Sharks, he found that some of the fish were novelty-seekers while others were less sociable and played it safe when exploring a new enclosure.

Mr Finger, of the Bimini Biological Field Station in the Bahamas, conducted the first study of its kind into the behaviour of Lemon Sharks, which are relatively easy to capture and handle, measuring less than a metre when they are young.

The biologist caught and tagged sharks living around 60 miles east of Miami and studied them in pools.

In a bid to determine if the sharks were sociable he watched them swim together for 20 minutes and documented their behaviour every 30 seconds.

Mr Finger told Smithsonian that two sharks typically follow each other and are sociable.

In another test that looked at solitary sharks in a new pen measuring 80 feet squared, they displayed distinctive personalities.

He said: They are not machines, they have personality.'

Certain sharks were more inclined to explore and were described as novelty-seeking, while others were more sociable, according to repetitive tests designed to ensure consistency.

The scientist presented the results of the study - which found novelty-seeking sharks tended to be less sociable then their peers and vice-versa - at the Joint Meeting of Ichthyologists and Herpetologists.

He said: 'You can’t generalise behaviour of one individual to a species.'

Despite the species' reputation as a fearsome predator and an aggressive hunter, Mr Finger says some sharks are 'pretty mellow' compared to their peers.

The biologist believes animals that usually live as part of a group take fewer risks than solitary creatures that are more prone to danger.

His work sits neatly within a new field of science called behavioral syndromes that studies how creatures' behaviour differs from one individual to another, but how their reaction is also consistent in a certain situation.

Scientists are interested in comparing research into animals' personalities across different species to see how the quality has evolved.

A mixture of personalities in a group could potentially have a huge bearing on the survival of certain species.

However, the idea that animals have personalities is not new and perhaps originated in the 1920s when Ivan Pavlov famously described his observations of different responses in dogs.

In the 1930s, an American psychologist created a way of grading the behaviour of young chimpanzees, but now studies are more mainstream and many scientists agree that animals can behave as individuals.

The research adds to an increasing amount of evidence that shows some intelligent animals can act as individuals with distinct personalities
