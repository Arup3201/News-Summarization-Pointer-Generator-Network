Thousands had queued overnight to get their hands on tickets. But yesterday there were still rows of empty seats on the major courts at Wimbledon – to the fury of those who had failed to get in.

Unoccupied seats were clearly visible at Centre Court as Serena Williams and David Ferrer played.

And as millions of Britons were glued to their television sets to watch Heather Watson’s fortunes, Court Two – where she lost to American teenager Madison Keys – appeared to be only half full.

The situation was better on Court One where Laura Robson was playing, but many seats still went unfilled. This was despite many of the tickets for yesterday’s show courts being allocated more than a day before the gates  actually opened.

Tennis fans watching at home took to Twitter to voice their frustration at the abundance of vacant seats

The empty seats led to a fierce Twitter row, with many blaming it on corporate hospitality clients failing to show up.

Sports presenter Gary Lineker wrote: ‘Lot of empty seats on centre court. Corporate lethargy, no doubt. What a waste of tickets so many would give their right arm for #wimbledon.’

The All England Club denied that the seats belonged to businesses and sponsors, saying that they were empty because spectators had gone to buy food.

However, tennis fan Neil Harris tweeted: ‘Please can someone explain to me as if I’m a 2 year old why there are empty seats at #Wimbledon2013 yet can’t buy ticket to save my life!’

Impatient 4Evita said:

‘Seems Wimbledon tickets have been wasted on businesses & sponsors, empty seats because they can’t be bothered turning up. Sound familiar?’

Rahmeh Aladwan wrote: ‘I’m getting increasingly angry at the empty seats of centre court.’

The subject was taken up by women’s No 1 Williams, who was asked yesterday if she thought those who didn’t want to sit and watch should give up their tickets.

The All England Club denied that the seats belonged to businesses and sponsors, saying that they were empty because spectators had gone to buy food.

She said: ‘Maybe there’s really good food here. But I think, you know, when a match starts, usually it takes a little while for the crowd to roll in.’

A spokesman for the All England Club said: ‘It’s a very long day. People don’t stay in their seats all day, they have to leave to eat and drink and so on. Less than 8 per cent of our tickets are corporate hospitality. And there were no hospitality seats on Court Two.’

The spokesman added that the hospitality suites knew in advance who was not able to attend, and were able to re-sell their tickets.

Last summer, thousands of seats at the London Olympics remained empty, much to the anger of those who had tried but failed to buy one.
