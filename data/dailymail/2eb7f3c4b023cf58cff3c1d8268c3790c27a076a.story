Tragedy: Danielle Formosa, 14, was found dead at a care home in Consett, County Durham on Tuesday

A friend of a girl who was discovered hanging at a house party nine days ago has been found dead at a care home.

Danielle Formosa, 14, died at East Farmhouse Children’s Home in Consett, County Durham, on Tuesday.

Police have said there are no suspicious circumstances surrounding her death and an inquest will be opened at Crook Civic Centre, in County Durham, today.

Danielle, sometimes known as Dani, was a Facebook friend of 14-year-old Sarah Clerkson who was found at a house party in Spennymoor, County Durham, earlier this month.

Sarah was found unconscious in a bedroom on Sunday December 8.

Frantic friends desperately tried to resuscitate her, but she died shortly afterwards in hospital.

The day Sarah died, Danni posted her own tribute on Facebook, that said: 'Love you Sarah, in so much shock it’s unreal. God always takes the best from us, sleep tight gorgeous, you will always be missed.'

A message on Danielle’s Facebook page 
read that she found the alleged bullies ‘absolutely disgusting’ and it 
felt ‘just like yesterday’ that the two of them were together.

Danielle went to St Anthony’s Catholic Girl’s Academy in Sunderland.

A spokesman for the school paid tribute to Danielle today.

She said: 'The whole school community is devastated by news of the death of Danielle Formosa. 

'We are praying for Danielle and holding her family in our thoughts and prayers at this very sad time.'

Friends and well wishers have taken to social media websites to make comments in memory of her young life.

A group called RIP Danni Formosa has been set up on Facebook and has more than 240 members while a similar group, Rest in Paradise Danni Formosa, has 135 members.

Gabrielle Wood posted: 'danni I’m missing you so much, not a day goes by We don’t think of you, love you so much, sweetdreams princess.'

Shannon Henderson wrote: 'Can’t believe we have lost such a nice caring and gorgeous girl like Danni. I don’t think it will ever sink in.

'We all miss you so much. Rest in Peace, princess and sleep tight, love you millions.'

Beth Parker added: 'RIP Danni you will be missed by so many people. We all love you and now you’re free, so spread your wings and be free. You have done your time and you make sure you party hard up there babe.'

A spokesman for Durham Constabulary said: 'Police attended an address in Consett at around 9.50am on Tuesday December 17 in response to reports of the sudden death of a 14 year old girl.

'A post mortem examination has taken place and there appears to be no suspicious circumstances.

'The coroner has been informed and an inquest will open on Friday.'

Sunderland City Council and Durham County Council both declined to comment.

A spokesman for the Samaritans said: 'We are there around the clock every single day of the year, including Christmas Day, for anyone who cannot cope.

'If anybody has got anything that they want to say to someone then we would urge them to contact us.'
