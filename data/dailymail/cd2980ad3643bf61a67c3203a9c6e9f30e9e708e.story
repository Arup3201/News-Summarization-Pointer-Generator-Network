Thousands of patients are dying in hospital each year because of bad handwriting, errors in maths and poor monitoring by nursing, according to a study.

The death rate at two hospitals fell by 15 per cent after nurses were given electronic devices in place of handwritten paper notes to record patients’ heart rates and breathing.

Researchers calculated that 750 deaths were prevented in a year at the two hospitals, Queen Alexandria in Portsmouth and University Hospital in Coventry.

At present, nurses are meant to measure patients’ heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen levels and take certain other readings and note them down on a board at the end of the bed: There is no suggestion that these nurses have illegible handwriting (File photo)

Across the NHS, this means 37,000 deaths could be avoided if nurses were given the devices rather than relying on traditional handwritten notes from nurses.

At present, nurses are meant to measure patients’ heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen levels and take certain other readings and note them down on a board at the end of the bed.

Often these readings aren’t taken regularly enough and in some patients there are gaps of between eight and 12 hours between measures.

In other cases, nurses handwriting is illegible or they don’t note down all the figures meaning it is not clear for their colleagues to monitor patients.

To address the problem of poor handwriting, hand-held devices were given to nurses at Queen Alexandra hospital in Portsmouth (above)

To address the problem, hand-held devices were given to nurses at Queen Alexandra hospital in Portsmouth in 2005 and at University Hospitals in Coventry in 2007.

They were handed either iPhones or iPads – small computers – installed with an app that takes patients readings and reminds nurses when they are next needed.

An alert flashes up on the screen if patients are deteriorating and in some cases they will urge nurses to summon a doctor.

Researchers compared the death rates for every year from 2004 – before the devices were used – to 2010.

They annual death rates fell by 397 at Portsmouth and by 372 deaths at University Hospitals Coventry in 2010 compared to 2004.

Dr Paul Schmidt of Portsmouth Hospitals NHS Trust, one of the leaders of the project, said: ‘Observing patients and making accurate records provides a safety net to guard against their deterioration.

‘We believed traditional paper charts were not doing the job well enough so we designed an electronic system to support staff. This study shows its introduction was followed by a significant drop in deaths.”

Dr Duncan Watson of University Hospital Coventry, who also worked on the project, said: ‘This technology improves the performance of routine but important tasks and frees up clinical staff to do what only human beings can do – care for patients.”

Many of the deaths avoided would have occurred in the elderly who had developed pneumonia or infections which would otherwise have been spotted too late.

Typically they cost around £500,000 to roll out across a medium-sized hospital trust and about 40 are now using them in at leat one department.
