Facebook is at the centre of a free speech storm after apparently blocking a page which supported one of Vladimir Putin's sternest critics.

Some 13,000 people joined an event page calling for a rally in central Moscow, where opposition leader Alexei Navalny faces up to ten years' jail over fraud charges he has branded 'utter lies'.

But the page can no longer be viewed within Russia after a request by the internet watchdog Roskomnadzor, the country's state-backed news agency reported.

Facing jail: A Facebook page supporting Russian opposition activist Alexei Navalny (pictured), who is accused of fraud by the Russian authorities, was blocked for non-Russian users sparking an outcry

Watchdog spokesman Vadim Ampelonsky said last night that the page had been blocked on the orders of Russia's general prosecutor.

According to the RIA-Novosti news agency, he said the prosecutor 'demanded to limit access to a number of resources calling for an unsanctioned mass event, including social networking groups. 

'The demand has been fulfilled.' 

The decision prompted outrage from Mr Navalny, the leader of Russia's opposition Progress Party, and former U.S. ambassador to Moscow Michael McFaul.

'It's a rather unpleasant and surprising behaviour by Russian Facebook,' wrote Mr Navalny, whose reputation was built up through a prominent anti-corruption blog and online campaigns.

Controversial: The blocked page called for an 'assembly' and 'discussion' in Moscow's Manezhnaya Square

'I thought they would at least demand a court order rather than rush to block pages as soon as crooks from the Roskomnadzor ask.'

Mr McFaul added that the block set a 'horrible precedent' and that Facebook should correct its 'mistake' as soon as possible.

Supporters quickly signed up onto parallel event pages and made new ones blasting Facebook's 'censorship'.

The page called for a rally in Moscow's Manezhnaya Square on January 15, the day the opposition activist will hear the verdict in a major fraud case.

Named 'People's Assembly: Discussion of the Navalny brothers' sentence', its description added: 'One for all and all for one. Life's too short to look at the table'. 

Outcry: Mr Navalny, pictured outside a Moscow court on Friday, turned his ire on the social networking firm

Mr Navalny, a 38-year-old lawyer, is accused with his brother Oleg of embezzling nearly 27million rubles (£300,000) when the Russian arm of cosmetics firm Yves Rocher  used their delivery firm.

The case is only one of many against him. A previous probe into embezzlement of a state timber company saw him sentenced to five years, though the sentence was suspended later.

In his final word this week Mr Navalny, who has spent almost a year under house arrest, said the case was based on 'utter lies.' 

He vowed to continue to defy President Vladimir Putin's rule, blaming the government for the rouble collapse and other economic woes and saying that 'it's robbing all of us every day.'

Despite these troubles President Putin's approval ratings have soared to more than 80 per cent, bolstered by the annexation of Crimea.

Facebook declined to comment, or confirm or deny it was responsible for the page being blocked.
