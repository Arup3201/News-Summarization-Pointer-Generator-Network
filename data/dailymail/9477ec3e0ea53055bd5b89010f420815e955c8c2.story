A model who failed in her bid to become Miss Leicester was offered the consolation crown of Miss Peterborough after no one from the city entered.

Marlene Star, 21, who studied sociology at Leicester University, was asked by competition organisers if she had links to other parts of the country.

She told them she lives in Peterborough, Cambs, and was delighted when they instantly offered her the crown because they had received no other entries.

She's a winner! Marlene Star had entered the contest in a bid to be crowned Miss Leicestershire but was crowned Miss Peterborough after no one entered

Marlene, a part-time model, said: 'No-one knows I've won it because there was no competition and there's nothing for me to do.

'I'd love to be invited to open a business or make a presentation.'

On ModelMayhem.com, Marlene writes: 
'I have established myself particularly in the Asian modeling industry, 
working alongside some of the most established photographers, make up 
artists and music artists internationally.

'I enjoy beauty, fashion, editorial and Asian bridal, nevertheless I am open to new ideas and concepts.

'I am half Indian half Italian, giving myself a European/Asian look, my look is pretty versatile,' she adds.

Marlene has since made it to the Miss England semi-finals but failed to reach this weekend's four-day finals in Torquay, Devon.

The Miss England grand final will take 
place on 15th and 16th June at the Riviera International conference 
centre, Torquay.
