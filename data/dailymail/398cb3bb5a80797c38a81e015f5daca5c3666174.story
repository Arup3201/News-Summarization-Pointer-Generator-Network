Drivers are to be given an extra time to avoid getting hit by fines when their parking ticket runs out.

Traffic wardens have been told to allow up to 10 minutes ‘grace’ after a ticket has expired before slapping a penalty notice on windscreens.

The new rules are aimed at curbing over-draconian parking fines used by town halls to raise extra cash from motorists, with CCTV cars banned from enforcing rules on on-street parking.

The announcement marks a new front in ministers’ pledge to end the war on the motorist.

Many drivers complain of returning to their moments after their ticket has run out to find an over-zealous traffic warden has already hit them with a fine.

Critics say concerns about penalties for parking could be forcing some people to abandon town centres in favour of out-of-town complexes where parking is often free.

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said: ‘Popping to the shops should be simple and pain free.

‘Slapping people with hefty fines is akin to criminalising shoppers and makes high streets or parades no-go zones for drivers.

‘By making 10-minute grace periods mandatory we can bring common sense back to parking on the high street and ease every traffic warden's finger off the ticket trigger.’

The rules are expected to come into effect in the autumn, and will mean that a driver who pays to park for an hour will effectively have up to 70 minutes before they will be fined.

The AA welcomed the move to limit the ‘ticketing on an industrial scale’ which has hammered hard-pressed motorists.

Ministers have also ordered an end to the use of CCTV spy cars to enforce on-street parking.

Official figures show councils which use CCTV cameras to enforce parking rules raise £49.35 per household each year, compared with £5.69 per household in council areas which do not have them.

 The Local Government Association has heavily criticised government plans to ban the use of CCTV cameras, with parking wardens only allowed to film if vehicles break the rules.

But Mr Pickles said: ‘CCTV spy cars can be seen lurking on every street raking in cash for greedy councils and breaking the rules that clearly state that fines should not be used to generate profit for town halls. 

'Over-zealous parking enforcement and unreasonable stealth fines by post undermine the high street, push up the cost of living and cost local authorities more in the long term. 

'Today the Government is taking urgently needed action to ban this clear abuse of CCTV, which should be used to catch criminals, and not as a cash cow.' 

If drivers are unable to buy a ticket because meters are out of order they will no longer be fined.

Controversial CCTV spy cars will also be banned from being used to target parked cars on an 'industrial scale'

There will be a new right for local people to demand a review of charges and yellow lines in their area. Parking penalty charges will also be frozen until the election.

Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin said: 'These measures will deliver a fairer deal for motorists, ensuring that parking enforcement is proportionate, that school children are protected and buses can move freely, and that key routes are kept clear.'
