Jacksonville Jaguars duo Marcedes Lewis and Sen'Derrick Marks showed their support for the Poppy Appeal  by laying a wreath at London's Cenotaph.

Both Lewis and Marks, who are gearing up for their side's upcoming match at Wembley against the Dallas Cowboys on Remembrance Sunday, raised money for the British Legion by selling poppies at the Tower of London. 

Tight end Lewis and defensive tackle Marks were joined by three members of the ROAR of the Jaguars, the team's cheerleaders, as they sold poppies and accepted donations from the public.

'It was actually so nice to go out and do something for what is a ridiculously good cause,' said Lewis. 'We were happy to get out there meet people from the UK and raise money for the charity because we really appreciate the sacrifice the military make whether they are from the US or the UK.

'The memorial at the Tower of London was pretty amazing, we couldn’t believe it when we saw it, so to be just a few steps away from there and doing your part was pretty humbling.

'I think I made the most money on the day because I’m so tall – and everyone was attracted to my smile of course – and it was fun to meet with people from London and the UK, do some good work and get to tell them about ourselves a bit as well.'

Marks added: 'We had a good time out there, getting out in the sun and meeting the public. It was funny getting asked by so people who we were and what we were doing but we got a lot of love. 

'And it was fantastic when we had people coming up to us and saying ‘good luck Sunday’ and things like that. We weren’t expecting that but it is a great feeling to know we are building fans in London as well.

'It is such a good cause and I was blown away by the memorial so we were definitely happy to get involved and sell some poppies.'
