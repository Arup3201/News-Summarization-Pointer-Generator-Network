From teas to curries, the Indian spice turmeric is back in vogue, popping up in smoothies, juices and fruit crumble.

While health fads come and go, using herbs and spices for medicinal reasons is one trend with staying power.

Here are some of the most popular herbs and spices and how they could improve your wellbeing:

TURMERIC FOR JOINTS

Studies have suggested that turmeric can ease joint pain and improve the memory of Alzheimer’s patients

Unlike many traditional remedies, turmeric has some medical muscle behind it. The main benefit comes from curcumin (a natural substance that also provides the bright orange colour), which contains powerful antioxidants and anti-inflammatories.

Some studies suggest turmeric alleviates joint pain, improves the memory of Alzheimer’s patients by helping to repair brain stem cells, delays diabetes, kills cancer cells and shrinks tumours. It can even help prevent heart attacks in those who have undergone a bypass by reducing inflammation.

SAGE FOR MEMORY

Some research has concluded that sage can improve memory skills

Old wives’ tales have long proclaimed sage — the star ingredient in most stuffings — to be good for your memory. New research has shown they were right.

The herb is thought to protect the chemical messengers that carry information in the brain and are essential to memory.

Researchers in the Medicinal Plant Research Centre at the universities of Newcastle and Northumbria have completed the first clinical trials of this herb and found those taking sage oil capsules performed better in memory tests.

GINGER FOR NAUSEA

Ginger can aid digestion and ease motion and morning sickness

Part of the family that includes turmeric and cardamom, ginger heats the body from the inside and encourages sweating, which is why it helps fight colds and flu.

It aids digestion and alleviates nausea (including motion sickness, morning sickness and hyperemesis gravidarium — the most extreme form of morning sickness that affected the Duchess of Cambridge).

It also helps expel excess gas from the digestive system, reducing bloating.

Some sufferers of osteo-arthritis and rheumatoid arthritis say that when taken regularly, ginger can reduce joint pain and discomfort. Researchers believe this is due to its potent active anti-inflammatories.

CINNAMON FOR BLOOD SUGAR

Cinnamon has been proven to reduce our body’s demand for sweet things by regulating blood sugar levels

Trying to give up sugar, but suffering with sweet cravings? Reach for powdered tree bark — or cinnamon — which has been proven to reduce our body’s demand for sweet things by regulating blood sugar levels.

Cinnamon has been shown to lower blood lipid levels including LDL cholesterol (the unhealthy type) and fat in the blood.

Add it to cereal, porridge, coffee and yoghurt or use as a marinade for meat.

CAYENNE FOR GOOD DIGESTION

Cayenne can improve circulation and also help lower moderately high blood pressure

Anyone who has eaten a curry will be familiar with the punch of cayenne pepper — and how it affects digestion.

Health advocates say it improves sluggish gut movements and boosts metabolism, which explains why it’s popular with celebrities on the lemon juice and cayenne diet.

It’s lauded for improving circulation and has been shown to help lower moderately high blood pressure, by dilating blood vessels. If spicy food isn’t to your taste, you can buy capsules that release capsaicin (the plant’s active compound) when it gets to your digestive system, meaning it bypasses your tastebuds.

MUSTARD FOR ASTHMA

Mustard seeds can help to alleviate the symptoms of asthma

The mustard plant — a variant of the brassica family — has been used for medicinal reasons since ancient times.

Brassicas contain naturally occurring compounds called glucosinolates, chemicals that have been proven to slow down the growth of cancer cells, particularly those in the lung, gut and colon.

Mustard seeds are rich in selenium and magnesium, which help to alleviate the symptoms of asthma.

NUTMEG FOR BRAIN POWER

Nutmeg should be used sparingly as it can have hallucinogenic effects if consumed to excess

This fragrant nut packs a punch in the health stakes. While it’s been recommended for years as a natural sleep aid (grate a touch into a cup of warm milk if you’re looking for a natural sedative), nutmeg is also thought to help keep the brain sharp and guard against denegerative conditions such as dementia, thanks to an active compound contained within it called myristicin.

Nutmeg is a good source of hard-to-get trace minerals such as copper, potassium, calcium, manganese, iron, zinc and magnesium.

Use nutmeg sparingly, as it can have hallucinogenic effects if consumed to excess. Don’t eat more than a quarter of a teaspoon in one go.
