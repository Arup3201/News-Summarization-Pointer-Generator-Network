A driver today admitting killing a couple by knocking them off their tandem bicycle while being pursued by police.

Nicky Lovell pleaded guilty to causing the deaths of 'perfect couple' Ross and Clare Simons in the accident near Bristol three months ago, and faces up to 14 years in prison when he is sentenced next month.

His girlfriend Louise Cox, who owns the car he was driving at the time of the crash, pleaded guilty to perverting the course of justice.

Killed: Ross and Clare Simons were knocked off their tandem bicycle in the horrific accident in Bristol

Mr Simons, 34, and his 30-year-old wife were mourned by hundreds of friends who described them as 'two peas in a pod' after their untimely death.

The couple had been married for 18 months and were planning to start IVF treatment at the time of their death in Hanham on January 27.

They had recently bought the tandem, and were making one of their first trips on it as they cycled to relatives nearby.

Lovell, 38, of Oldland Common in Gloucestershire, pleaded guilty at Bristol Crown Court to two counts of causing death by dangerous driving and one of driving while disqualified.

Cox, 35, who owns the Citroen Picasso involved in the crash, admitted lying to police when they asked who had been driving her car after Lovell fled the scene.

Judge Neil Ford QC adjourned the case for a pre-sentence report to be prepared for Cox.

He told her: 'The fact I am adjourning the case is no indication of the type of sentence you will receive.'

Cox was released on police bail, but Lovell has been remanded in custody ahead of sentencing.

Lovell,
wearing glasses and a baggy T-shirt in court, spoke only to confirm his
name and enter three guilty pleas during the ten-minute hearing.

He pleaded guilty to causing the 
deaths of Mr and Mrs Simons by driving dangerously on January 27 this 
year, and also admitted driving while disqualified on the same date.

Cox
spoke only to plead guilty to a charge of perverting the course of 
justice on January 27 by giving the police a false name and description 
when asked to identify the driver of her vehicle after the collision.

The
judge adjourned the case until May 22 and asked for a bigger court room
to accommodate friends and family of Mr and Mrs Simons, as well as 
those of the defendants.

Support: Family and friends of the crash victims as they arrived at Bristol Crown Court today

Speaking
outside court, Detective Chief Inspector Rachel Williams of Avon and 
Somerset Police said she hoped the guilty verdicts would provide 'some 
comfort' to Mr and Mrs Simons' families.

The
officer said: 'On Sunday January 27 of this year, Clare and Ross Simons
needlessly lost their lives following a fatal collision.

'This
collision was caused by Nicholas Lovell, a disqualified driver who got 
behind the wheel of the car and drove at speed, before losing control 
and striking the couple while they cycled.

'Nicholas
Lovell then ran away from the scene in a bid to escape, leaving behind 
Louise Cox who then deliberately and callously set out to mislead police
at the scene.

'The 
pleas entered today by both Nicholas Lovell and Louise Cox reflect that 
both have taken some responsibility for the deaths of Ross and Clare.

'While these pleas will never bring Ross and Clare back, I hope they go some way to providing comfort for their families.'

Grief: Friends left flowers piled up at the site where the Simons were killed while cycling

Tribute: A photograph of the couple left at the scene in remembrance of the beloved pair

Paying tribute to the couple, Mr Simons' sister Kelly Woodruff said: 'They were two amazing people and so, so loved.

'To have them taken away from us is heart-wrenching. They were the perfect couple. They loved each other unconditionally, they were made for each other.

'Ross was the best brother. We were very close and I don't know what I'll do without him. He did anything for everyone.

'Clare was equally special. She brought her own qualities. She had a heart of gold. It was a privilege to have her as a sister-in-law and as a friend.'
