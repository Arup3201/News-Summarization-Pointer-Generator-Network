West Ham will finalise a pre-contract agreement with Hamilton left-back Stephen Hendrie on Thursday.

Due to Hendrie's age, the clubs will also agree a compensation package of around £1million.

The move looked to be off last week when Hamilton vice-chairman Ronnie McDonald criticised West Ham, however, David Sullivan has smoothed over negotiations.

Reading and Bournemouth had also shown an interest in the Scotland Under 21 international but he had his heart set on a move to Upton Park.

West Ham left back Dan Potts is discussing a move to Blackpool while talks are continuing with Manchester United midfielder Darren Fletcher who is available on a free.
