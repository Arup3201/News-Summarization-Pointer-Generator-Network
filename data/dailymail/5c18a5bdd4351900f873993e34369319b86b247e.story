Pope Francis said that guardian angels exist and people who listen to their advice are less likely to make the wrong decisions.

'The doctrine on angels is not fantasist. No, it's reality,' the pope said on Thursday during his daily mass in the small chapel in his residence at the Vatican.

'According to Church tradition we all have an angel with us, who protects us and helps us understand things,' he said in a message to mark the feast of the guardian angels, celebrated by Catholics on October 2.

The up-beat message that humans are helped along in life by an otherworldly guardian was in stark contrast to former pope Benedict's insistence in 2012 that angels did not sing at the birth of Christ -- news that devastated many a carol singer and earned him the epithet 'killjoy pope'.

Francis asked 'how often have we heard 'I should do this, I should not do this, that's not right, be careful ...'. So often! It is the voice of our travelling companion.'

The pope advised sceptics to ask themselves 'how is my relationship with my guardian angel? Do I listen to him? Do I say good morning to him? Do I ask him to watch over me when I sleep?

'No one journeys alone and no one should think that they are alone,' he said.

His comments came ahead of a global assembly of Roman Catholic bishops that's shaping up as the first major showdown of Pope Francis's papacy, with conservative and progressive cardinals trading insults ahead of its start on Sunday.

The two-week synod on the theme of the family will be attended by more than 250 people - nearly all of them bishops of the 1.2 billion-member Church and also 13 married couples.

The session will prepare the way for a larger gathering of Catholic clerics next year and could become a milestone in the clash between conservatives and liberals over the future direction of a Church that the pope has insisted must become less bureaucratic and theologically esoteric.

The synod, the first since Francis' election in March 2013, is seen as a test case for him and his vision of a Church he wants to be closer to the poor and suffering and not 'obsessed' by issues such as homosexuality, abortion and contraception.

The run-up to the meeting has been dominated by a rare public feud between cardinals centred on whether the Church should modify teachings that ban Catholics who have divorced and then remarried in civil services from receiving communion.

For Catholics, a second marriage without an often lengthy Church annulment of the first amounts to adultery and anyone remarried in a civil ceremony cannot receive communion at Mass unless they refrain from sexual relations with a new partner.

That issue has emerged as the most likely candidate for possible reform after Pope Francis ordered a worldwide survey of Catholics and heard that many ignored Church teachings on birth control, sex before marriage or acceptance of homosexuality.

Cardinal Walter Kasper, a German the pope has called one of his favourite theologians, has argued that the Church must find ways of showing mercy to people whose first marriages have failed and who want to remain an integral part of the Church.

But even the suggestion of change has galvanized conservatives, including a handful of senior Vatican officials.
