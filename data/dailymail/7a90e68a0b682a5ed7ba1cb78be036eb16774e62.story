For two Aussie flatmates, it all began as a fun project to recreate the iconic opening credits from their favourite television show, The Simpsons.

They used pixel art, which mimics the distinctive style of retro arcade games, to pay tribute to the 26-year-old credits which are known and loved in households across the globe.

On February one Melbourne-based mates Ivan Dixon and Paul Robertson uploaded their incredible 'Simpsons Pixels' clip to YouTube and were amazed when it went viral, receiving more than a million hits in the first two days.

But the real shock came when just twelve hours after their upload an email landed in their inbox from the makers of The Simpsons, requesting that they ring straight away.

The clip was seen by the creators of The Simpsons and just 12 hours later the young Melbourne men received an email requesting they call the US as soon as possible

'The email went to my spam folder, so I actually thought it was a hoax!' Dixon told Fairfax media.

Instead, it was an entirely genuine request for their fantastic appropriation to be used as the opening credits for the very next episode of the Simpsons.

It has been a whirlwind and a dream-come-true for the graphic designers.

'We secretly hoped they would pick it up, but it all came so fast,' Dixon told Fairfax.

Exactly two weeks after the clip was uploaded, it will be seen at the beginning of a new episode which is set to air in the US this Sunday February 15 at 8pm.

The flatmates called on visual artist Jeremy Downer to recreate the notorious Danny Elfman theme song for their clip, perfectly pairing with their arcade game theme.

The artists have paid meticulous attention to detail, recreating scenes like Maggie and Marge driving

And although the artists admit they had a lot of fun creating the video, they had to pay meticulous detail to ensure they carried it off without a hitch. 

In each episode of The Simpsons, the credits begin with prankster Bart Simpson writing a new phrase on the blackboard at Springfield Elementary School. 

Appropriately for the duo's contribution, the digitised credits open with Bart scribbling 'Pixel art is not art' repeatedly during detention.

The quirky trip through Springfield shows the Nuclear Plant, Kwik-E-Mart, Moe's Tavern and their home at Evergreen Terrace as never seen before.

Bart skateboards through town as if in a Mario Bros game, swerving through some familiar faces - and gaining 50 points when he bounces on barman Moe's head.

The tribute video cleverly references some classic Simpsons moments for keen-eyed, die-hard fans.

One of the most impressive moments of the clip is Marge's volumous hair flick at the supermarket

These include Stampy the elephant in a field;  Poochy on a boardwalk; Homer Simpson's barbershop quartet 'The Be Sharps' on the pub roof and the tragic Maude Flanders with a halo.

However, there are new details to be found on every replay. 'Number One' from The Stonecutters and a flying pig are both particularly well-hidden within the action.

In another nod to the gaming culture the creators love so much, nerdy muso Lisa Simpson plays the saxophone whilst the other students in the classroom stare down at their laps, distracted by their Gameboys.

As for the ending, The Simpson's voice artist Hank Azaria put it best when he tweeted the clip with the caption: 'This gets kind of mind blowing at the end!' 

Dixon and Roberston are extremely talented and already have some amazing accomplishments to their name.

Robertson works on graphics for games and did animation for episodes of Disney show Gravity Falls.

Dixon was co-director on three of acclaimed Australian musician Gotye's filmclips. He has created Rubberhouse, an animation studio. 

He is beginning to gain notoriety, as just two weeks ago one of Dixon's clips was shared by UK comedian Ricky Gervais on his official Facebook page to more than two million followers. 

The hilarious cartoon shows Gervais' character from 'The Office' Brent dancing manically using the same pixel art animation.

As for The Simpsons intro, there's also an extra incentive for anyone who manages to identify all the cameos in the clip.

'First person to name all the references wins a date with one of the hunks who made the SIMPSONS PIXELS video,' the pair joked.
