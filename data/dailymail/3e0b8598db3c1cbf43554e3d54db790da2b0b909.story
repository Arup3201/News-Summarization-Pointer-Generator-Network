The  lead violinist of a world-renowned string quartet was arrested in New York this weekend after going on a naked rampage through a hotel and choking a complete stranger.

However, the Leipzig String Quartet say 42-year-old Stefan Arzberger was actually the real victim, claiming he was drugged while drinking at the hotel bar.

Arzberger was first caught walking around the Hudson Hotel 'completely naked' on Friday morning, according to law enforcement officials who spoke with the New York Post.

Around 8am, he knocked on the door of a 64-year-old tourist from North Carolina, who answered. 

'He stuck his arm out, and she tried to slam the door shut, but he stuck his arm in between the door and the door jamb,' the source said. 'He barged inside and grabbed her around the neck with both hands and started strangling her.' 

Arzberger allegedly choked the woman  - who was a complete stranger - so bad that blood vessels in her eyes ruptured. 

A hotel worker who heard the poor woman's screams ran to her aid and pulled the deranged Arzberger off of her. 

The NYPD arrested Arzberger on charges of strangulation and burglary. He was released on $100,000 bail on Saturday, and his lawyer says he has no criminal record.

'He’s an upstanding member of society without a criminal record who has devoted his life to the arts,' lawyer Nicholas Kaizer told The Post. 'He has no record anywhere, and we hope at the end of the journey, he has no record here.' 

The quartet was also quick to defend their leading member. In a statement, the group claimed that Arzberger may have been slipped a drug the night before while drinking at the hotel bar since he remembers nothing of his crazed attack. 

'We have to announce that Stefan became on Sat. 26th victim of a serious crime in New York City. Things are in clearance now. At this time the lawyers do not allow to divulge more information. We feel great solidarity and hope for a sudden end of that nightmare! Stefan, we are with you!' the statement reads.

The Leipzig String Quartet has played all over the world, including the Library of Congress recently.
