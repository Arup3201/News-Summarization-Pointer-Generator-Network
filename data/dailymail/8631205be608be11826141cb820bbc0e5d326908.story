Ostrich meat kebabs are being added to the barbecue range at hundreds of high street stores.

Tesco is putting the free range ostrich meat on sale in 400 locations amid evidence the nation is developing a taste for exotic and unusual meat.

Just last Christmas, Lidl was offering reindeer steaks and claimed it was unable to keep up with demand, while the discount chain Budgens has previously put squirrel on its shelves.

It is possible to buy Llama mince, imported from Chile, on Amazon plus many other exotic choices, ranging from Zebra steaks, to crocodile, kangaroo, camel and elk, from specialist suppliers.

Tesco is pushing the 300g packs of Mossel Bay ostrich kebabs for £5 on special in-store promotional displays.

Details were revealed in The Grocer magazine, which said the fast rising discounters are also following the latest food trend. Aldi will offer ostrich kebabs in September and Lidl plans to have ostrich meat on its shelves this Christmas.

The kebabs at Tesco are supplied by wholesaler DB Foods, which said a trial of Mossel Bay ostrich steaks at Britain’s biggest supermarket in March had gone ‘very well’.

There are some ostrich farmers in the UK, however the meat being sold by Tesco comes from South Africa as the result of an exclusive deal with a farmer co-operative called Mosstrich.

Tesco buyer Megan Kent said that speciality meats were increasingly popular with customers adding: ‘These ostrich kebabs are perfect for a summer barbecue.’

DB Foods is already supplying more than 2,000 High Street butchers and Whole Foods Market with the kebabs and chief executive Ben Bayer said that ostrich was set to become increasingly visible to consumers.

He said: ‘It is our ambition to see ostrich become a mainstream meat. It’s nutritional, has a great taste and is a healthy red meat.’

Ostrich is a particularly healthy red meat, coming in at just three per cent fat, compared to around 10.5per cent for beef, 15.2per cent pork. It even has less fat than chicken, which is typically 7.4per cent.

Historically, there have been animal welfare concerns about the farming of ostriches, particularly when it was carried out in the UK, amid concerns the climate was too cold and wet.

Similarly, there were concerns that the birds should not be reared in intensive crowded conditions where they were kept under cover in barns and so were unable to run around and enjoy a natural existence.

Mr Bayer, who said his company is in talks to supply other retailers, dismissed animal welfare concerns raised when the meat was sold in the UK in the 1990s.

‘We have worked closely with Mosstrich on animal welfare,’ he said.

Claire Nuttall, partner at branding agency Thrive Unlimited said that to grow interest in a speciality meat, suppliers needed to generate awareness of dishes where the meat made a tangible difference.

‘Or they need to demonstrate another benefit, such as price, health or ethics, to make the meats feel like more than a one-off curiosity,’ she said.
