Up on the stage, the beauty queen contestants were aglow with fake tan and beaming smiles.

In the audience, however, things were turning ugly.

Jeering, shouting and fighting wrecked the climax to the annual Miss Scarborough beauty pageant as burly bouncers took on drunken thugs who were furious at the result.

A seaside beauty pageant descended into chaos when a group in the crowd started a brawl over the Jess Gale (pictured) being picked as the winner

The ten-person gang then attacked security staff and threw glasses after deciding the Miss Scarborough contest was 'fixed' when their favourite for the crown - Shannon (circled bottom left) was eliminated

Frightened children as young as five 
were caught up in the chaos, an elderly grandfather on two walking 
sticks was knocked over and a group of around eight people were seen 
brawling as the winner, Jessica Gale, 18, posed for pictures. Then the 
police were called.

There had been no hint of trouble when the 12 beauties opened the event by parading before the panel of judges.

But
 as the evening progressed and ever more drink was consumed, supporters 
of contestant Shannon Collins began shouting and disrupting the event, 
said witnesses.

When she 
failed to make the top six there were angry shouts of ‘fix, fix’ and the
 successful girls were booed and hissed, with the noise drowning out 
much of the proceedings.

 Billy Coyne, right, and Luke Burton, left have all been accused of being behind the chaos which they deny

Miss
 Gale, 18, said: ‘The trouble was caused by a table who had too much to 
drink. They were shouting over the other contestants and it started to 
knock people’s confidence. It made us feel horrible.’

She said that because of the violence she was not able to collect her prize.

‘I
 looked across as I was having my picture taken and saw someone laid on 
the floor and another person on top punching his face. An old man was 
knocked over and one girl stamped on a bouncer’s head.’

Miss England organiser Angie Beasley said in her 26 years of running the beauty contests she had never come across such an ugly turn of events

Pageant organiser Diane Yalezo said she cried for days after the thugs 'completely ruined' the celebration for Miss Gale

Another finalist, Jennifer Pinchbeck, 18, described the disruption as ‘very rude’.

Some
 of the alleged troublemakers were identified as Shannon’s boyfriend 
Billy Coyne, his sister

Jess and friends Ben Howram and Luke Barton. The
 four have been sent a letter warning them they face being barred from 
the seaside resort’s venues for any future trouble.

The audience before the brawl broke out. Those blamed for the trouble have now been posted with warning letters from Pubwatch, threatening to bar them if they misbehave again

Jess
 Coyne denied they were to blame, saying: ‘They picked on us all night, 
and the bouncers were heavy-handed, provoking us all night.’

Luke
 Barton said he had not been drinking and kept away from any trouble. 
‘The bouncers grabbed Billy for no reason and there was a scuffle.’

He said he did not recognise many of the people involved in the brawl.

North
 Yorkshire Police confirmed they had been called to the venue at 11.45pm
 on Saturday but said they had not received any complaints and no one 
had been arrested.

Miss Gale will now go on representing the coastal town in the Miss England final, held in Torquay in June

Miss Gale said: 'I'm so excited. I'm overwhelmed. It's Miss England next and I'm just going to give it my best shot for Scarborough'
