England will host the UEFA Under 17 European Championships in 2018, with the tournament to be staged at venues across the Midlands.

UEFA’s Executive Committee announced their decision on Monday following a two-day meeting in Nyon, Switzerland and it means England will host the 16-team competition for the first time since its inception in 2002.

John Peacock’s under 17 side are the defending European champions, having beaten Holland on penalties in last May’s final in Malta.

The Football Association’s national football centre at St George’s Park will be the headquarters for the tournament, with teams also based at Loughborough and Warwick Universities.

Grounds likely to be used to host fixtures include Burton Albion’s Pirelli Stadium, the closest League venue to St George’s Park in Staffordshire.

Wayne Rooney, who was voted UEFA’s golden player at the 2002 under 17 finals after scoring five goals, said: ‘As England captain, I am delighted that UEFA has chosen St George’s Park for the 2018 U17 European Championships.

‘I have no doubt the tournament will give us the opportunity to show the quality of our facilities.

‘I would also like to congratulate all those involved in bringing the tournament to England, I have never had the opportunity to play in a home-based tournament so the experience for our U17 squad should be extra special and I hope that the lads seize the opportunity before them.’

Reflecting on his experience of playing in the tournament in 2002, just two years before he announced himself as a global star at Euro 2004, Rooney added: ‘Playing for England in the U17 finals in 2002 was, at the time, the proudest moment of my life.

‘I quickly discovered playing tournament football is completely different to normal competitive matches. Playing in Denmark gave me great experience and a first taste of the atmosphere and conditions of playing for your country in the finals of a tournament.

‘From my point of view, I found the experience invaluable. I can still remember that feeling you get when things are going well as we progress throughout the tournament.

‘We eventually lost to Switzerland, the eventual winners, in the semi-final, but bounced back with a great team performance in the third and fourth place play-off game, beating Spain and I was fortunate enough to score a hat-trick.’

Rooney, who made his full England debut the following year, added: ‘Looking back now I would say that a player experiencing tournament football as early as they can is a vital part of a player’s development.

‘In my case I was able to use my experience of 2002 in the 2004 Euros in Portugal with the senior England side.’

The incentive is there for the England class of 2018 to emulate the fantastic achievements of Patrick Roberts, Dominic Solanke, Adam Armstrong and co, who lifted the trophy last year in Malta.

Rooney added: ‘Winning the tournament last year in Malta has shown that we have some great talent paying for England and coming through the system. Hopefully we can continue this level of success with all of our development teams.’

FA Chairman Greg Dyke said after the announcement: ‘I would like to thank the UEFA President and his executive committee for their support.

‘We discussed this proposal when Mr Platini visited St George’s Park last November and he was very positive - not just about the world class facilities but also the hugely positive development environment he found.

‘We won the U17 finals in 2010 and 2014, and reached the semi-finals in 2011 so hosting the final round for the first time makes sense.

‘It will complement our new England DNA strategy with its aim of helping to give young, talented players the best pathway to achieve their full potential.’

Peacock’s team are currently in the process of qualifying for the 2015 Euros in Bulgaria, with England paired with Norway, Romania and Slovenia in the elite qualifying round, on home territory, to be staged in March.
