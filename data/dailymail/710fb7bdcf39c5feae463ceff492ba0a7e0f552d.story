Police are set to begin using a 'Spider-Man' net which wraps around a speeding vehicle's wheels to stop cars.

The 'Spider-Man speed bump' is rolled across a road when a car is approaching.

As the front wheels pass over it, spikes spring out and puncture the tyres, throwing a net around the wheel as they do, causing the vehicle to quickly come to a halt.

How it works: The 'Spider-Man speed bump' fires spiked nets around a car's front wheel, puncturing the tyres and causing it to stop within metres

'Back
in 2010, the ideas behind a squid's sticky tendrils and Spider-Man's 
super-strong webbing were combined to create a prototype for the first 
remote device able to stop vehicles in their tracks,' the US Department of Homeland Security said.

Today it revealed the latest version of the technology.

'The Pit-Ballistic Undercarriage Lanyard (Pit-Bul) essentially is a tricked out speed bump,' it said.

'Hidden inside is a set of spikes attached to a net.

'When deployed, the spikes puncture the tyres and the net tangles in the car's axles.'

Made of panels that easily slot together, it can be set up for single or double lane coverage, and police can trigger it from nearby.

'If a driver blows through a 
checkpoint, the agent can press a button and the car's tires are spiked 
and netted in milliseconds,' said Mark Kaczmarek, the SQUID program 
manager in S&T's Borders and Maritime Security Division.

'No 
high-speed pursuit is needed, and no one's life is put at risk.'

In action: Spikes puncture the truck's tyres, while the nets wrap themselves around the car's front axle

The spikes pop up and puncture the tyre, and also hold the net so it is deployed around the wheel

The system can easily be taken apart and put together at the roadside

The system can also be used unattended, for instance on a private driveway.

If somebody crashes through a gate
when no officers are on duty, a sensor activates the Pit-Bul to 
deploy.

The gate crasher is stopped on the spot.'

The team also revealed a 'spike strip' which is contained in a 
suitcase and can be remotely triggered to deploy the spikes across the 
road.

Currently, spike strips are placed by hand in the fleeing driver's 
path, usually at the last second so as not to impede other traffic.

The NightHawk is placed on the roadside and does not require an officer to stand nearby to deploy the device.

The developers say the system will work on everything from a compact car to an SUV at speeds of up to 40mph

'Traditional methods of deploying spike strips by hand in the path of
a fleeing driver can put an officer's life in danger, and are not 
always effective,' Mart√≠nez said.

'When an officer is radioed that a fleeing vehicle is approaching, 
they can quickly place NightHawk on the side of the road and move a safe
distance away.

'When the target vehicle approaches, before the driver has a chance 
to react, the officer can remotely trigger the spiked arm to deploy 
across the street and puncture the vehicle's tyres.'
