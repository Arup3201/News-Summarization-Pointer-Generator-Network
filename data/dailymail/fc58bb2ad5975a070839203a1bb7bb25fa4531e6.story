Gus Poyet has hit out at the Premier League for the scoring system used in the Fair Play Table in which Sunderland are rock bottom.

The Black Cats boss is currently contesting an FA charge of improper conduct after he kicked over a drinks bucket and was sent to the stands during the 1-1 draw at Hull earlier this month.

But Poyet is at a loss to explain why his side are considered the least sporting in the top flight.

‘I don’t know how they get the points - it’s so superficial,’ said Poyet of the table which takes into consideration factors such as positive play, respect towards opponents and behaviour of the coaching team.

‘Until two months ago we hadn’t had a sending off, so how can we be bottom?

‘Maybe when I wave my arms, that’s minus one. Maybe the club will have to tie my hands behind my back!

‘We got fined once (for surrounding the referee) and we corrected that.

‘I don’t care who’s in charge of the fair play rules, but they’re not fair. It’ s an invention.’

Referencing Newcastle’s Papiss Cisse and Manchester United’s Jonny Evans being banned for spitting, Poyet added: ‘How many points is it for someone spitting at someone? Three million?

Cisse has been banned for seven games, while Evans has received a six game suspension 

‘Me, I’d use common sense. I’ve not seen anything that makes me think we’re dirty, so why we’re bottom, I don’t know. I’d like someone to explain.

‘But there would be no explanation, just words that don’t make sense. I don’t accept it. I don’t care what they say, it’s not true.’

Meanwhile, Poyet’s side – without a win in five – have another fight at the wrong end of the Premier League table and face relegation rivals Aston Villa this afternoon.

The Uruguayan played alongside new Villa boss Tim Sherwood at Spurs and is wary of their revival.

‘I enjoyed playing with Tim next to me,’ he said.

‘He was always a character and you need characters on the pitch.

‘What you see is what you get, there is no side to him. I know he will add forward play to his team and we need to be ready. They have had a couple of big derby wins so normally you would think they are in higher spirits than us.’ 

Poyet is looking forward to coming up against former teammate Tim Sherwood at the weekend
