Matt Prior and Stuart Broad will have surgery at the end of the month in a bid to solve chronic long-term injury problems.

Wicket-keeper Prior — who said he was taking the rest of the summer off after the second Test at Lord’s to recover from an Achilles tendon problem – has seen a specialist who was ‘shocked’ at the severity of the swelling in a heel.

Prior, 32, will now have an operation and will not play again this season.

Out: Matt Priot and Stuart Broad will both have surgery at the end of the month to sort injury issues 

Broad, 28, who retired hurt yesterday after having his nose broken when he top-edged a bouncer, will have surgery on a knee condition. His Swedish surgeon — Hakan Alfredson — carried out career-saving knee surgery on Kevin Pietersen and footballer Zlatan Ibrahimovic. Broad will fly to Sweden after the fifth Test at The Oval, which begins on Friday.

Meanwhile, former England captain Andrew Strauss has expressed surprise that ex-coach Andy Flower has been given a job coaching the Lions.

He said: ‘It’s slightly strange he is so intimately involved in the England set-up.’

Brutal: The bouncer made it past Broad's helmet and he suffered a big blow that ruled him out vs India
