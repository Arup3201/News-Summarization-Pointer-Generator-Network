News that Hello Kitty, the Japanese cartoon character created by Sanrio, is not a cat but actually a little girl called Kitty White, has devastated millions of fans.

But no one was more overwhelmed by the news than this little girl, who could not contain her shock, horror and disbelief that the popular character is not who she seemed to be.

The youngster, Lou, was utterly dismayed at the revelation. And she didn't hold back her feelings, venting at her mother who filmed her dramatic reaction and posted it on YouTube.

Not actually a cat: The character is actually a real human little girl who lives outside of London, has a twin sister, and a cat of her own

‘What’s the matter, Lou?’ her mother asks. ‘What did you just find out?’

‘I’m not talking,’ Lou says. And then proceeds to let rip, demonstrating an eloquence far beyond her  years.

‘Hello Kitty is not an actual cat,’ she says, on the verge of tears, lips a-quiver and with a wobble in her voice. But she doesn't let her emotions take over.

Flabbergasted: Lou hates the fact that Hello Kitty, who celebrates her 40th birthday this year, isn't a cat

‘She’s a little girl,’ the child continues, clearly disbelieving the news.

‘And how does that make you feel? You don’t like it?’ her mother asks.

‘I hate it,’ the child says vehemently, staring at the camera.

‘She looks like a cat,’ she screams. And quite sensibly as well.

Articulating every word, the girl continues, ‘She cannot be a human.’ 

Close to tears: The child is clearly upset at Sanrio's decision to announce Hello Kitty's non-feline credentials

Her hands raised to stress every point, Lou finds herself at a loss for words when asked to explain further

‘She is a cat that acts like a human, like a usual cartoon. They have animals that act like humans and sometimes they aren't even humans, they’re animals!’ she exclaims.

Looking utterly fed up with having to explain the fundamental difference between cats and human beings, the child sighs deeply, saying ‘I hate it.’

Another little voice chimes in, asking, ‘But why is the show called Hello Kitty?’.

‘Because apparently her name is Kitty White. I don’t like it,’ she pouts.

‘I’m sorry,’ her mother says. 

‘You’re not posting this on Facebook either,’ the child ends the tirade.

‘My daughter didn't appreciate the truth about Hello Kitty,’ the mother posted on YouTube

According to Sanrio, Hello Kitty is a real human little girl who lives outside of London, has a twin sister and a cat of her own, and will forever be in third grade.
