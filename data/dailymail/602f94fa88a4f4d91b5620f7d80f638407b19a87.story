Supermarket giant Coles has been misleading its customers about its 'freshly baked' bread, the Federal Court has ruled.

On Wednesday, it was found labelling on the supermarket's Cuisine Royale and Coles Bakery products that stated the goods were 'Baked Today, Sold Today' - and in some cases 'Freshly Baked In-Store' - were false, misleading and deceptive.

The Federal Court has ruled Coles has been misleading its consumers about its 'freshly baked' bread products

It was found the products were partially baked and frozen off-site, then transported and finished in store at a Coles bakery. Additionally, the Cuisine Royale range was baked and frozen overseas.

The products were then promoted as 'Baked Today, Sold Today' or 'Freshly Baked In-Store'. They were also placed near signs that read 'Freshly Baked' or 'Baked Fresh'.

The court ruled Coles was giving a misleading representation that the partially baked bread products had been baked on the day of sale or baked in a fresh process using fresh not frozen product.

When handing down his judgment, Chief Justice James Allsop said it was not the court's place to dish out advice on how Coles ran its operations, but urged it to look at the way it promoted its bread products.

ACCC chairman Rod Sims (left) said the move from Coles gave them a competitive advantage. But Coles spokesman Jon Church (right) said it was never their intention to mislead the public

'A start would, however, be to make it tolerably clear to the public that the recent baking was the completion of a baking process that had taken place sometime before, off site, and that "freshly baked" actually meant the completion of the baking process of frozen product prepared and frozen off site by suppliers,' he said.

ACCC chairman Rod Sims said they had been concerned about Coles' misleading claims.

'These claims also placed independently-owned and franchised bakeries that freshly baked bread from scratch each day at a competitive disadvantage,' he said.

'Today's decision confirms that Coles misled consumers about the baking of these bread products. 

The bread was being baked off-site and not in-store, and in some cases overseas

'Consumers should be able to rely on the accuracy of credence claims made by businesses like Coles to promote their products, especially where those claims are used to compete with smaller businesses which are genuinely offering a differentiated product.'

According to the ACCC, credence claims are representations of a premium or special characteristic that are difficult for a consumer to test the accuracy for themselves. They can be a powerful marketing tool that can be used to mislead consumers if they are not used properly, which can have the potential to impact on the competitive process. These claims are a priority area for the ACCC at this point in time.

Coles spokesman Jon Church said it was never their intention to mislead the public about their breads and would be changing its labelling soon.

'Whether baked from scratch in-store or "par baked" by our suppliers and finished in our ovens, our bread and baked goods are great quality products which taste great and are convenient for customers. They have won a number of awards around the country,' he said.

'In talking to customers about the ‘par-baked’ bread range, we certainly never set out to deliberately mislead anybody, but we completely accept that we could have done a better job in explaining how the products are baked.

'We are already well advanced in changing product packaging and other information.'

The Federal Court will hand down its court orders to Coles in Melbourne at a later date, with Channel Nine reporting the supermarket giant could face a fine of up to $1 million. The ACCC is seeking penalties, declarations, injunctions, costs and other orders.
