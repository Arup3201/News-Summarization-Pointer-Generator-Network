As MailOnline Sport prepares to lead the way with more Deadline Day exclusives (we broke Ozil to Arsenal and Fellaini to United a year ago), we ask those at the vanguard of our news operation, our brilliant reporters, what to expect with the transfer window poised to slam shut…

IAN LADYMAN - @Ian_Ladyman_DM

1. Best bit of business so far… Diego Costa to Chelsea. They needed a centre forward so they bought one.

2. Which fantasy move do you still want to see happen in this transfer window? I would like to see Sergio Busquets play in the Premier League. Anywhere.

3. Name one transfer deal likely to come off before 11pm on Monday… Daley Blind from Ajax to Manchester United.

Best bit of business? Sportsmail's Ian Ladyman is impressed with Chelsea's capture of Diego Costa

4. What’s your best/biggest transfer exclusive of your career? In early April 2009 I wrote that Real Madrid had a deal with Manchester United to buy Cristiano Ronaldo for £75m. United denied it and Sir Alex Ferguson was asked about the story and said: 'Look who wrote it.' It wasn’t meant as a compliment and indeed the story was wrong. The fee – confirmed two months later – was £5m more.

5. Name one thing you’d change about the transfer window… I would end it when the season starts. Hard to do, of course, unless all the major European leagues agreed to start on the same day.

Penned: Cristiano Ronaldo (next to Alfredo di Stefano and Eusebio) signed for Real Madrid five years ago 

ROB DRAPER - @draper_rob

1. Best bit of business so far… Gylfi Sigurdsson from Spurs to Swansea: good player who will thrive back in Wales. Not showing it yet, but Mauricio Isla could be excellent for QPR.

2. Which fantasy move do you still want to see happen in this transfer window? Radamel Falcao joins Arsenal for £60m - just to make it a three-way title race.

3. Name one transfer deal likely to come off before 11pm on Monday… Daley Blind to Manchester United

4. What’s your best/biggest transfer exclusive of your career? The most significant was the transfer of an unknown 16-year-old to Arsenal. It got about 50 words in the paper. I told the desk Cesc Fabregas would be good.

5. Name one thing you’d change about the transfer window… Transfer deadline day to become like the NFL draft. All the chief executives to be herded into the NEC Arena, watched by a crowd to do all their business in public. A fleet of helicopters on standby to fly players from around the country for medicals and grand unveilings.

Sitting, waiting, wishing: Sportsmail's Rob Draper expects Ajax defender Daley Blind to move to Man United 

Young Gun: Cesc Fabregas' move to Arsenal in 2003 went almost unheralded but was noted by Rob Draper

DOMINIC KING - @DominicKing_DM

1. Best bit of business so far… Manchester City smoothly concluding the contract extensions of their star players. The deals to re-sign David Silva, Vincent Kompany, Edin Dzeko and Sergio Aguero happened during the window. You don’t have to buy players from elsewhere to make your squad stronger.

2. Which fantasy move do you still want to see happen in this transfer window? Liverpool making a £10million bid to take Petr Cech and being successful with it. Brendan Rodgers needs a keeper, Cech has been ditched by Chelsea. It won’t happen as the clubs won’t do business with each other – as proven by Ryan Bertrand – but it would help Liverpool considerably if it did.

3. Name one transfer deal likely to come off before 11pm on Monday… Danny Welbeck joining Tottenham on loan.

Fantasy: Sportsmail's Dominic King wants Liverpool to succeed with a bid for Chelsea's Petr Cech

You're not going over there? Sergio Busquets would be a seen as a major coup for the Premier League 

4. What’s your best/biggest transfer exclusive of your career? Lucien Mettomo to Manchester City from Saint-Etienne in September 2001. I was 23, had the story confirmed by Kevin Keegan one Friday morning and got the tale in print in the old ‘City final’ edition, in the days when evening papers were still published in the evening. Mettomo wasn’t the biggest name, he wasn’t a City great but it was the first time I’d had ‘exclusive’ next to my byline for a transfer story.

5. Name one thing you’d change about the transfer window… It doesn’t need changing now. Everyone knows how it works, everyone looks forward to the drama of the final day; let’s just leave it as it is.

CRAIG HOPE – @CraigHope_DM

1. Best bit of business so far… Chelsea identifying what they need – a goalscorer and central midfielder – and duly bringing in Diego Costa and Cesc Fabgreas at a cost of £62million, less than what Manchester United paid for Angel di Maria. Newcastle’s acquisition of £5m Holland right back Daryl Janmaat also looks very shrewd. He’ll no doubt be sold for £12m within the next 18 months, however.

2. Which fantasy move do you still want to see happen in this transfer window? Newcastle sign a goalscorer, for a half decent side will go to waste without someone to put the ball in the back of the net. To that end, Loic Remy for £10m from QPR would make a lot of sense.

Makes sense: Sportsmail's Craig Hope believes Newcastle should shell out £10m for QPR's Loic Remy 

Expected: Reading's Alex McCarthy should make the £6m switch to QPR before Monday's deadline 

3. Name one transfer deal likely to come off before 11pm on Monday… Fabio Borini to Sunderland on a season-long loan. The Liverpool striker is still playing a waiting game with the Black Cats - who have had a £14m bid accepted - but the arrival of Mario Balotelli at Anfield could make his mind up and a loan move is more likely.

4. What’s your best/biggest transfer exclusive of your career? When I was nine years old I saw Sunderland midfielder Paul Bracewell in a restaurant next to St James’ Park. It was close-season and he was with two men in suits. I went home and told all of my friends he was signing for Newcastle, which the very next day he duly did. Today, I would have posted a selfie on Twitter with Bracewell and it would have been on MailOnline within half an hour. As it was back in 1992, I had my exclusive for 24 hours.

5. Name one thing you’d change about the transfer window… One?? Undisclosed fees for a start. But while we’re at it, the window should shut on the Thursday before the Premier League season starts.

SAMI MOKBEL - @SamiMokbel81_DM

1. Best bit of business so far… Cesc Fabregas to Chelsea

2. Which fantasy move do you still want to see happen in this transfer window? Edinson Cavani to Arsenal

3. Name one transfer deal likely to come off before 11pm on Monday… Reading goalkeeper Alex McCarthy to QPR. £6m. Four-year deal

4. What’s your best/biggest transfer exclusive of your career? Mesut Ozil to Arsenal, September 2013, and Thierry Henry back to Arsenal on loan.

5. Name one thing you’d change about the transfer window… Scrap the winter one and end the summer window the day before the start of the season.

Leader of the pack: Sportsmail's Sami Mokbel's biggest exclusive was Mesut Ozil's £42m move to Arsenal 

LAURIE WHITWELL - @lauriewhitwell

1. Best bit of business so far… Diego Costa for £32m will end up looking a snip if his goals win Chelsea the league.

2. Which fantasy move do you still want to see happen in this transfer window? Arturo Vidal to Manchester United - finally bringing some steel to midfield.

3. Name one transfer deal likely to come off before 11pm on Monday… Liverpool winger Jordon Ibe to Derby County on loan.

4. What’s your best/biggest transfer exclusive of your career? Georgios Samaras to WBA on a free this summer. Don’t smirk.

5. Name one thing you’d change about the transfer window… That it gets smashed into a thousand shards and doesn’t exist.

Why don't you come on over? Arturo Vidal should make the move to Manchester United this weekend

JOE BERNSTEIN - @RedJoe31

1. Best bit of business so far… Chelsea, Diego Costa

2. Which fantasy move do you still want to see happen in this transfer window? Arjen Robben to Arsenal

3. Name one transfer deal likely to come off before 11pm on Monday… Javier Hernandez to Juventus as make-weight in deal to bring Arturo Vidal to Old Trafford

4. What’s your best/biggest transfer exclusive of your career? Robbie Keane leaving Liverpool for Spurs after six months

5. Name one thing you’d change about the transfer window…. Transfer fees were independently verified to prevent buying and selling clubs misleading the fans (and us) with bogus figures eg. Barca and Liverpool over Suarez

That didn't last long! Robbie Keane (right) spent just six months at Liverpool before rejoining Tottenham
