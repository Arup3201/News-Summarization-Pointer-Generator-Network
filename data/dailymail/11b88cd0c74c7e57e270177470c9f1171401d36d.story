Iran's nuclear chief has claimed the country's nuclear programme has been hit by two attempts of sabotage as sources claim the attacks could be linked to the U.S. military.

Iran’s vice president and the chief of its nuclear-energy agency Fereydoun Abbasi claimed power lines between the holy city of Qom and the underground Fordow nuclear centrifuge facility and others leading to Iran’s Natanz facilities were blown up with explosives in August.

He alleges that 'terrorists and saboteurs' might have infiltrated the International Atomic Energy Agency in an effort to derail his nation's atomic program.

Speaking at the IAEA's 155-nation general conference, Abbasi challenged the perpetrators to launch new attacks - stating his country is determined to learn how to protect its interests through such assaults.

He then suggested that IAEA might have been connected to the blasts, stating: 'Terrorists and saboteurs might have intruded the agency and might be making decisions covertly.'

Abbasi then added that IAEA inspectors turned up to inspect an underground enrichment plant soon after its powerlines had been blown up, asking: 'Does this visit have any connection to that detonation?'

It comes as American sources have claimed there is a possibility that the U.S military may be connected to the attacks.

A retired U.S. intelligence officer who 
still works as a contractor with the U.S. military told The Daily Beast 
that U.S. Special Forces have trained for sabotage missions inside Iran 
for years.

He said: 'From the first reports, this attack looks like something from our guys.'

Patrick Clawson, the director of research for the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, told Yahoo: 'Covert American operations against the Iranian program is a good way to persuade the Israelis that the United States will back up its words with deeds.'

The plant at Fordo, about 40 miles south of Tehran is buried deep in a mountainside to protect it from assault.

It also is being used to enrich 
uranium closer to the level needed for a nuclear warhead than what is 
used to power most industrial reactors.

Abbasi
added the sabotage was foiled 'by using backup batteries and diesel 
generators' that prevented any disruption to centrifuges used to spin 
uranium to enriched levels.

He also said a separate attack on the
country's centrifuges - through tiny explosions meant to disable key 
parts of the machines - was discovered before the timed blasts could go 
off.

Abbasi did not elaborate on the date or other details of that alleged assault attempt.

Dozens of unexplained explosions have 
hit the country's gas pipelines and Iran's first nuclear power plant 
suffered major equipment failures delaying its operations for decades 
before going on line this year - delays that some experts attribute to 
acts of sabotage.

But
Abbasi insisted: 'We are a powerful country. We can confront any kind 
of industrial espionage whether it is an explosive or a virus.

'We are eager and interested to ask the other side to have more (attacks) because having more we would be more experienced.'

He then attacked America - claiming U.S. pressure on Iran is the equivalent of an attack on all developing nations' nuclear rights.

He called U.S.-led sanctions on Iran's oil exports and financial transactions 'the ugly face of colonization and modern slavery'.

The speech caused hardline Israeli leaders to call for military strikes on Iran - arguing that diplomatic efforts and economic penalties have had no effect.

Iran has warned that any Israeli attack would trigger a devastating response and Abbasi suggested that such strikes would not succeed in slowing down his country's nuclear program.

He said without elaboration that experts have 'devised certain ways through which nuclear facilities remain intact under missile attacks and raids'.

But Abbasi insisted that his country's nuclear program is aimed only at making reactor fuel and doing medical research.

He said: 'The Islamic Republic of Iran ... has always opposed and will always denounce the manufacture and use of weapons of mass destruction.'
