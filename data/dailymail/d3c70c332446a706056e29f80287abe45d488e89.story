Normally the preserve of designer boutiques, the waiting list has now made an appearance on the British high street with savvy shoppers paying homage to the quality of clothing.

It would seem that the economic downturn has made cash-strapped shoppers look to ‘ordinary’ shops to bag the hottest finds. The latest ‘must have’ item can be found at your local M&S.

M&S Collection Notch Lapel Oversized Duster Coat, part of Marks & Spencer’s Autumn collection, has had store phones nationwide ringing off the hook.

The M&S Collection Duster Coat is a new season must-have and is selling  out fast across the country

The light pink coat priced at £85 is part of the new collection- the first under its new style director, Belinda Earl- which was launched back in May.

The high street giant did not stage a catwalk show like many of its counterparts but merely releasing a few photographs of the item sparked a flurry of interest.

The coat arrives in shops today, in the colour of the season, a dusky blush pink, and the Marble Arch store in London already has a list of 100 customers expecting to be called.

Lauren Santo Domingo, the New York socialite and founder of modaoperandi.com, says ‘FOMO’ - fear of missing out- is behind the growth in waiting lists.

She told a national newspaper: ‘Being able to secure those potentially impossible-to-find items in advance actually supersedes the hysteria associated with frenzied bricks-and-mortar shopping.

‘But the gratification of knowing you’ve already secured your dream wardrobe makes it all worth the wait.’

Women are opting for ‘quality’ high street clothes which they feel have as much cachet as designer labels, with the bonus of not bankrupting them.

The waiting lists have also become increasingly popular due to the growth of the high street catwalk show and social media.

During Whistles first catwalk show at London Fashion Week in February, fashion editors posted a flurry of pictures on Instagram and Twitter.

Shoppers were able to see which items would be hitting their local high street in late August allowing them to plan ahead.

By
 the time the high street chain’s new autumn collection arrived in store
 this week, there was a long list of people wanting their camouflage 
items.

Meanwhile, high-end 
fashion is also reeling in the shoppers with a long waiting list for 
Christopher Kane’s camouflage dress at Selfridges. It costs £1,195.

Bosse
 Myhr, designerwear buying manager at the department store said: ‘These 
are the items that insiders will recognise - not by a logo, but by a 
detail, shape, print or motif - conversation pieces for the fashion 
loving and literate.’

She added: ‘Being able to secure those potentially impossible-to-find items in advance actually supercedes the hysteria associated with frenzied bricks and mortar shopping.

‘But the gratification of knowing you’ve already secured your dream wardrobe makes it all worth the wait.’

The success of the coat will be a boost for M&S after it reported dire fashion sales earlier this year.
