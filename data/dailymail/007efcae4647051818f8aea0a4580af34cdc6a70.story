Conservative Party co-treasurer Peter Cruddas has resigned after being filmed apparently offering access to Prime Minister David Cameron in return for donations of £250,000 a year.

The senior Tory fundraiser told undercover reporters pretending to be business representatives that 'things will open up for you' if they donated that amount of money to the Tories.

In a meeting secretly recorded by The Sunday Times, he said: 'It will be awesome for your business.'

Announcing his resignation, Mr Cruddas said in a statement: 'I deeply regret any impression of impropriety arising from my bluster in that conversation.

'Clearly there is no question of donors being able to influence policy or gain undue access to politicians.

'Specifically, it was categorically not the case that I could offer, or that David Cameron would consider, any access as a result of a donation. Similarly, I have never knowingly even met anyone from the Number 10 policy unit.

'But in order to make that clear beyond doubt, I have regrettably decided to resign with immediate effect.'

Mr Cruddas said he only took up the post at the beginning of the month and was 'keen to meet anyone potentially interested in donating'.

He said he had not consulted any politicians or senior party officials before the recorded conversation.

Mr Cruddas told the undercover reporters that 'premier league' donors - those giving £250,000 a year - could lobby Mr Cameron directly and their views were 'fed in' to Downing Street. He said there was no point in 'scratching around' with donations of £10,000.

According to The Sunday Times, he believed that any prospective donations from the reporters - pretending to be wealth fund executives - would come from Liechtenstein and would be ineligible under election law.

Peter Cruddas, Britain’s 15th richest man, has enjoyed a spectacular rags-to-riches story. The son of a meat porter in London’s East End, he left school at 15 and went on to become one of the richest men in the City.

After starting out as an office junior he became a City trader before setting up the spread betting firm CMC Markets, which focuses on bets on the financial markets.

In 2007 the investment bank Goldman Sachs bought a 10 per cent stake in CMC, which valued Mr Cruddas’s business at £1.4 billion.

He has given about £350,000 to the Conservative Party in the last two years and also helped bankroll the recent ‘No to AV’ campaign.

Friends describe Mr Cruddas as a classic ‘Cockney geezer’ who enjoys his wealth.

He showed off a £200,000 platinum watch in one recent interview and boasted that he had 15 more.

He told one interviewer: ‘I’ve got a £10 million apartment in Monaco, a £5 million house in England, another fantastic house in Antibes, a yacht and a private jet.’

In one shopping spree he bought 17 pairs of shoes at the same store so he could have identical pairs in each of his five homes.

He is also known to have been a member of the prestigious Monte Carlo Golf Club, which plays host to some of Europe's top players.

They are said to have discussed the creation of a British subsidiary and the possibility of using UK employees to make the donation.

The journalists secured the two-hour 
meeting with Mr Cruddas through Sarah Southern, a former Conservative 
Party staffer now working as a lobbyist.

The
 Sunday Times said she told the reporters they should make a 'huge 
donation' if they wanted access to senior government figures.'

Mr Cameron today responded to the damaging revelations by branding Mr Cruddas's 'cash for access' claims as 'completely unacceptable'.

The Prime Minister insisted that was 'not the way' the Conservative Party raised money and promised an inquiry to ensure it would not happen again.

He said it was right that treasurer Peter Cruddas had resigned overnight in the wake of the revelations about his comments to undercover reporters posing as potential donors.

'What happened is completely unacceptable. This is not the way that we raise money in the Conservative Party, it shouldn’t have happened,' Mr Cameron told BBC News.

'It’s quite right that Peter Cruddas has resigned. I will make sure there is a proper party inquiry to make sure this can’t happen again.'

The claims are particularly damaging, however, given Mr Cameron's strong stance on 'secret corporate lobbying' which he declared in 2010.

In February 2010, while leader of the opposition, he said: 'I believe that secret corporate lobbying, like the expenses scandal, goes to the heart of why people are so fed up with politics.

‘It arouses people’s worst fears and suspicions about how our political system works, with money buying power, power fishing for money and a cosy club at the top making decisions in their own interest.'

A Conservative Party spokesman said: 'No donation was ever accepted or even formally considered by the Conservative Party.

'All
 donations to the Conservative Party have to comply with the 
requirements of electoral law. These are strictly enforced by our 
compliance department.

'Unlike
 the Labour Party, where union donations are traded for party policies, 
donations to the Conservative Party do not buy party or government 
policy.'

Labour challenged the Prime Minister to 'come clean' about what he knew and when.

'Time
 and again the Tory party has been the obstacle to capping donations 
from wealthy individuals. Now it appears obvious why,' said Labour MP 
Michael Dugher who was speaking before Mr Cruddas quit.

'Pensioners,
 the young unemployed and squeezed middle families cannot afford to buy 
this sort of access or influence which is just another reason why this 
government is out of touch with the overwhelming majority of British 
people.

'David Cameron should come clean.

Access: Mr Cruddas said financiers who gave 'premier league' donations could get access to Mr Cameron, possibly at venues such as the Prime Minister's Buckinghamshire retreat, Chequers

'Will the PM say exactly what he knew and when about an apparent effort to sell access and influence in Downing Street?'

The Conservative Party said Cruddas would be replaced in his post by Stanley Fink, a member of the House of Lords who had previously held the role.

Liberal Democrat Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander said Mr Cruddas’s comments were 'utterly disgraceful' and made the case again for reform of party funding - an issue that came under scrutiny when Tony Blair’s government was embroiled in allegations that honours were awarded in return for cash for the Labour Party.

Attempts at a cross-party consensus for reform have repeatedly foundered.

Sleaze watchdog Sir Christopher Kelly warned today that the parties could 'duck the issue no longer'.

Mr Cruddas also told the Sunday Times that Mr Cameron hosted major donors at receptions at his official Downing Street residence and at Highclere Castle, the location used in British television drama 'Downton Abbey.'

Sir Christopher, chairman of the independent Committee on Standards in Public Life, said: 'It would be wrong to regard this as an isolated event. Events like it are inevitable as long as the main political parties are dependent for their existence on large donations from rich individuals or, in the case of the Labour Party, a small number of trade unions.

'The parties collectively need urgently to address the damage this does to confidence in the integrity of the political process.

'All three of the major parties promised to end the ‘big donor culture’ in their manifestos for the last election.

'The promise also featured in the Coalition agreement. My Committee last autumn provided a blueprint for doing so which we believed to be both reasonably fair and sustainable and which, because we are an independent committee, was not distorted by thoughts of party political advantage.

'Nothing has so far happened. I imagine this is presumably because it requires all the parties to face up to some difficult issues which they would rather avoid. They should not be allowed to duck the issue any longer.'

In November last year the topic of party funding became national news when a key committee warned that large financial contributors were being given 'preferential access to political decision makers'.

The committee on standards in public life recommended that party donations be capped at a maximum if £10,000 each, while Conservative co-chairman Andrew Feldman told the committee: 'There is no question of individuals either influencing policy or gaining an unfair advantage by virtue of their financial contributions to the party.'

The 'cash-for-access' row involving Conservative Party co-treasurer Peter Cruddas evokes memories of political scandals past.

Two years ago, with Labour still in power, there was a row over so-called 'cash-for-influence' when three former Cabinet ministers were suspended from the Parliamentary Labour Party over allegations that they were prepared to take cash to influence government policy.

Geoff Hoon, Stephen Byers and Patricia Hewitt were filmed by Channel 4's Dispatches programme discussing the possibility of working for what they thought was an American lobby firm.

In the middle of the decade was the 'cash-for-honours' affair, which raised questions about the activities of the two biggest parties.

Alleged links between the granting of honours and financial support for parties dogged the last two years of Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair's time at Number 10.

An influential group of MPs which considered the issue said in December 2007 that membership of the House of Lords should be decided by an independent body in a fully transparent process.

The then chairman of the Public Administration Committee, Dr Tony Wright, said that though no charges were brought over the scandal, trust in public life had been damaged.

A police inquiry had followed a complaint by Scottish National Party MP Angus MacNeil in 2006 that financial support was being rewarded with honours in contravention of a 1925 anti-corruption law.

It had been reported that millionaires who gave large donations to the Labour and Conservative parties were to be given peerages.

During the inquiry, Mr Blair became the first prime minister to be interviewed by police as part of a political corruption inquiry.

The following year, after a £1.4 million, 19-month investigation, the Crown Prosecution Service announced that nobody would be charged, as there was no realistic prospect of a conviction.
