A father who was caught on camera kicking his six-year-old son down a skateboard ramp apologized today but said his attempt to help the boy overcome his fears has been misunderstood.

Marcus Crossland, 27, and his wife Emily spoke to Today on Monday after a video emerged earlier this month of the father kicking his son Dino off a 13ft platform, causing the child to howl in pain.

The parents, from Jacksonville, Florida, said that the uproar caused by the video caused Mr Crossland to lose his job and the family are now moving home.

Marcus Crossland apologized for kicking his son Dino down a skateboard ramp earlier this month. The father said that his 'bonehead decision' cost him his job and he and wife Emily (right) are now moving their family from their Florida home and starting over

Mr Crossland said: 'It was a bonehead decision. It was an effort to help him but it didn't come across that way... I'm sorry I used that tactic as opposed to another.'

The 27-year-old explained the decision to push his son off the steep ramp as 'my poor attempt at trying to help him overcome his fear'.

He added: 'Because of a decision I made, my wife and my children and everybody has got to deal with it.'

His wife Emily said the video, which was originally uploaded to Instagram by a teenage skater, has turned the family's lives upside down and now they plan to start over.

She said that what has happened has been extremely confusing for her little boy.

'It's something I tried to shield him from,' she said. 'He knows he's been on the news. But he is doing wonderful, he's happy and he's healthy.'

The mother said that her husband's actions were 'not acceptable' in their household but that what happened on April 27 was an isolated incident.

She said: 'Nothing like that has ever happened before, there is nothing behind closed doors. He's a really great dad, he loves his family, he's a good person.'

Police and the State Attorney’s said last week that an investigation is ongoing, according to jacksonville.com.

The Department of Children and Families declined to discuss a specific case.

The six-year-old fell down the ramp, landing with a loud bump and a howl. His father has been investigated by the child welfare department and the local sheriff's office following the incident

The
 video led to public outcry after it was uploaded and then shared on an 
Instagram account IGersJax which documents life in Jacksonville, First Coast News reported.

Martin
 Ramos, the skate park's operator, told First Coast News that the father and son are 
regulars at the park but that he hadn't seen Mr Crossland act that way 
before.

'He said he was just caught up in the 
moment. He seemed very remorseful. He certainly understands the gravity 
of the situation and it seems like he is going to be answering to this 
thing for quite some time to come,' Mr Ramos said.

He added: 'Unfortunately parents get so enthusiastic about their kids and their abilities in skateboarding, or baseball, or football or whatever and sometimes they take it a little too far.'

Mr Ramos reportedly asked Crossland to stay away from Kona State Park for a little while.

The family welfare department in Jacksonville along with the sheriff's office are investigating the incident.

Mr Crossland's son, nicknamed Dino the Dinosaur, is well-known in the area. There are multiple videos of Dino skating and performing tricks to YouTube.

Dino was not hurt in the fall, Mr Ramos told ActionNews, and continued to skate after he was kicked by his father.

The teenager who posted the video online told FirstCoastNews that he asked Mr Crossland why Dino was kicked so hard.

'He said "because he needs to learn". I was like "pushing him down is not teaching him how to drop in". And then he said "Do you think you can raise him better than me?" and I said yes,' the 13-year-old said.

Online commenters heavily criticized Crossland for his parenting skills.

'How about someone push this a****** off a bridge. #sorryimnotsorry,' one user said.

'he needs to be reported if this is what he did in public view what you thing [sic] he does at home god be with this little boy,' another wrote.

'Man....do not show him to me if we are skateing [sic]....it would really take a lot to keep me out of jail,' another said.

'That guy is a complete a******!' another commenter wrote.

The six-year-old, nicknamed 'Dino the Dinosaur' is well-known in the area for his skateboarding skills and multiple videos of the little boy's tricks can be found on YouTube

Dino was not hurt from his fall down the 13ft ramp in Kona State Park earlier this month. Although he has been 'confused' by what has happened his mother described him today as 'happy and healthy'
