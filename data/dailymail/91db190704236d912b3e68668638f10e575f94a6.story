Christmas Eve turned tragic in a small New Hampshire town when a volunteer firefighter pulled a dying woman from the wreckage of a car crash - only to realize after she was dead that the victim was his own daughter.

Steve Whitcomb was horrified to find his 30-year-old daughter Katie Hamilton, a mother of three, had died on the highway after a crash pushed her SUV into oncoming traffic and she was hit head-on, Brookline Police Chief Bill Quigley revealed Tuesday.

Whitcomb, 58, owns a heating and air conditioning business in the town of 5,000 and volunteers as a firefighter in his spare time.

According to New Hampshire police, three cars were involved in the accident.

Greg Cullen, 31, of Milford, New Hampshire first rear-ended Hamilton’s Ford Explorer SUV.

Hamilton had been either stopped or was slowing down to turn left, reports the Nashua Telegraph, when Cullen’s Toyota pickup smashed into her.

‘At the last minute - we don't know if it was driver distraction or what the cause was, we haven't been able to determine that,’ Brookline Police Chief Quigley said.

‘He swerved to avoid hitting her and still struck her on the very right rear corner of her vehicle, forcing her to come over to the northbound lane.’

The crash involved three cars. The other two drivers in the crash were not injured

That’s when James Ciprotti, 37, of Weare, New Hampshire, smashed into Hamilton head-on in his Ford F-250.

Cullen and Ciprotti were given medical evaluations, but neither was injured.

Katie died at the scene.

Brookline Police Sgt. Douglas Barnett said the accident is still under investigation but police do not believe speed or intoxication were factors in the crash.
