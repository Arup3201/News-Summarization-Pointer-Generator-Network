'Fraud': Keith Webber, pictured today outside Bristol Crown Court, stands accused of fraud, forgery and theft

A crooked probate lawyer stole £210,000 by writing himself into his clients' wills, charging inflating fees and convincing them to give him large cash 'gifts', a court heard.

Keith Webber, 67, gained the trust of four 'elderly and vulnerable people' - including his own sister-in-law - who made him sole executor of their wills and trusted him implicitly.

But he then used a variety of methods to steal their money, including exaggerating his fees and persuading them to sign over assets into his name, Bristol Crown Court heard.

Prosecutors claim that in one case he made himself the main beneficiary of a will, and in another continued taking his client's money even after she had died.

For one ploy he turned against his own family to empty his sister-in-law’s account, while on another he claimed to be in a relationship with his victim to avert suspicion, a jury was told.

Webber denies four counts of fraud by abuse of position, one of forgery and another of theft at Bristol Crown Court.

Rupert Lowe, prosecuting, said: 'These elderly and vulnerable people trusted him because he was a very professional and proper person and they believed he was honest.

'But instead of looking after their affairs he actually found ways to help himself to their money. He would persuade, or deceive, them into making him large gifts, tens of thousands of pounds.

'Sometimes it would be in the form of exaggerated fees from his work, sometimes it the form of generous gifts which they suddenly wanted to make.

'He would also have them sign assets over to him, he would hang on to money from accounts he would receive and pocket money due to them.

'After their deaths he would continue to charge, grossly inflated fees from so-called work. In one case he altered the main beneficiary of a will so he would inherit all her money.

'He engaged in acts of dishonesty and deceiving exploitation on elderly and vulnerable people to enrich himself.'

The court heard how Webber ran a business known as Will Power, later changed to KEW Wills, where he managed wills and powers of attorney.

But it was claimed that he abused his powers with a number of clients, including his sister-in-law, Esther Larn, her husband David, and two women, Audrey Jarvis and Vera Costan.

Webber’s alleged deception began in September 2009 when Mr and Mrs Larn moved to his home town of Chard, Somerset, to live in sheltered accommodation.

The court was told that within six months Webber had convinced his sister-in-law to revoke any powers another sister, Margaret, had over the couple, and give them to him.

As a result Webber gained complete control over their estate and all monetary matters.

It was claimed he would use the couple’s bank account to write large cheques payable to his wife Joan - Esther’s sister - in order to make them look like gifts.

At one point the couple were allegedly tricked into handing over £36,000, before another £25,404 was taken to cover Webber's 'fees'.

Mr Lowe told the court that a will written in 2009 only listed 'clothes' being due to Mr Webber, with his wife in line to inherit a quarter of their estate.

But by the end of 2010, when both had died, Webber had stolen more than £77,000 from them and inflated his wife’s claim to half of the estate, the jury was told.

'It is not often you get given gifts of over £36,000 when they had only wanted to leave him clothes just a year before,' Mr Lowe told the jury.

He added: 'The fees represented a continuation of his abuse of his position.

'Once you add that to the petrol he was claiming, and the £36,000 of ‘gifts’, that is already over £68,000 in a 13 month period.

'It works out at £4,700 a month, it is a cash cow for Mr Webber.'

Webber even continued to steal after the couple’s deaths, withdrawing money from their accounts with their debit cards just hours after widower Mr Larn passed away.

The court also heard that Webber abused another client, Audrey Jarvis, and made regular trips to see her in Surbiton, Surrey.

Prosecuters said he encouraged her to sign over a power of attorney, then wrote 'quite substantial cheques' to himself totalling £11,500, it is claimed.

When questioned about the motive for this money he claimed the pair were 'spiritually close' and, despite his embarrassment, she had insisted he took them as gifts.

Webber began to empty Mrs Jarvis’s bank accounts, cashed in her £35,000 Prudential policy, her £32,000 Friend’s Life policy and £25,000 of Premium Bonds, prosecutors claim.

The court heard that when Webber realised Mrs Jarvis was dying he rang up her bank and asked for £1,000 to be transferred to him, in a 'last throw of the dice'.

Mr Lowe said: 'Audrey is about to die so this is the last throw of the dice for Mr Webber as far as his power of attorney is concerned. He helps himself to as much as he possibly can.'

Webber denies Fraud by abuse of position in relation to power of attorney between September 20 2009 and October 2010 and fraud by abuse of position as sole executor of a will between October 9 2010 and March 2011 in relation to David and Esther Larn.

He also denies fraud by abuse of position in relation to power of attorney between July 13 2011 and October 20 2011, and fraud by abuse of position as sole executor of a will between October 2010 March 2011 in relation to Audrey Jarvis.

He pleaded not guilty to forgery of a will between December 3 2012 and March 6 2012, and theft on February 14 2012, of Vera Costan.

The trial continues.
