Smiling for the cameras as make-up artists dab foundation on their nipples, the models backstage at Versace's S/S15 menswear show could have stepped straight off the set of 2001 film Zoolander.

Others are pictured with curling rags in their hair, while one shows off an impressive six-pack as he snaps a photo while make-up artists work on his legs.

A third stands passively while concealer is dabbed on beneath his eyes while a fourth meekly submits to having his legs waxed.

All later appeared in the latest menswear collection from Donatella Versace, which along with loosely tailored suits in cornflower blue, black and white, also saw the return of the skintight form-fitting t-shirt.

More unusual were the swimsuits, with Versace opting to send single-shoulder swimming costumes down the runway alongside more traditional tight, white pants.

But it wasn't all bizarre swimwear and brooding models. The latest round of menswear shows kicked off in Milan on Saturday, with Calvin Klein, Marni and Jil Sander among the big names setting the standard.

Calvin Klein offered a return to 90s minimalism, with nude form-fitting vests deconstructed and turned into t-shirts with the help of loose, mesh sleeves.

True to form, creative director Italo Zucchelli kept things neutral, using the same easy-to-wear nude on everything from shorts to shirts.

While Zucchelli's work was wearable, Britain's Vivienne Westwood chose political instead, using her new menswear collection to rail against cruelty to pigs.

In a far cry from Versace's buffed and bronzed models, many on the Westwood catwalk sported pig's noses, while t-shirts came emblazoned with a pig logo.

Despite the politics, much of what was on offer was sporty perfection, with beautifully cut joggers and some excellent tailoring among the highlights.

Tomorrow will see pieces by DSquared2, Roberto Cavalli and Giorgio Armani take to the runway on the final day of Milan Menswear before the action moves to Paris, starting on the 25th.
