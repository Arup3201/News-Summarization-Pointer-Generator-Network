A cancer sufferer running a gruelling marathon was forced to stop by officials after just eight miles - because she was 'too slow.'

Single mother Anne Pharo travelled to Germany to compete in the Frankfurt Marathon but was left humiliated when she was ordered to stop running.

The 41-year-old, who is battling breast cancer, even claims officials and police followed her closely for four miles demanding her to 'run faster or give up.'

Ms Pharo, of Leigh Park, Hampshire, was diagnosed with breast cancer for the second time in January this year.

While training in June, Ms Pharo broke her foot but was determined to complete the 26-mile Frankfurt event.

She says she would have taken six-and-a-half hours to complete the marathon if she had continued, but she said the way she was treated was tantamount to bullying.

Ms Pharo, who works in e-banking, said: 'It has been a tough year. In January this year, I was told my cancer had returned in my other breast.

'I had surgery and reconstruction but unfortunately the reconstruction did not work.

'I got a serious infection and had to have a second surgery to remove the implant.

'In June, I broke my foot but I kept going with training. So, to be told to stop running because I was too slow was devastating.

'From four miles the organisers and police in vans, cars and on motorbikes were behind us, ushering us to "run faster or give up".

'But I was pacing myself so that I could finish the race.

'At eight miles, they said we were not allowed to continue because they needed to clean the streets. This was just bullying.

'They didn't offer us an alternative route on the pavement and, once we stopped, they drove off and left us there.

'We had no idea where we were and I was devastated.'

Two years ago, Ms Pharo completed the London Marathon and raised over £2,000  for a breast cancer charity.

She said: 'I completed the London Marathon in 2012 in 5hrs 19mins. Perhaps I was a bit slow, but I raised over £2,000  for Breakthrough Breastcancer.

'When my friend suggested last year that we do Frankfurt I thought I'd go for it.'

She says that she has read the rules and there is no cut-off point.

However athletics expert Colin Goater, race director for the Great South Run, said a cut-off time was normal for marathons.

He said: 'There are various reasons for it. Road closure orders only last a certain period of time.

'The administrators will be concerned about traffic problems. There is the insurance to think about. If a collision occurred it would be a difficult situation.'

The organisers of the Frankfurt Marathon have not yet responded to a request for comment from MailOnline.
