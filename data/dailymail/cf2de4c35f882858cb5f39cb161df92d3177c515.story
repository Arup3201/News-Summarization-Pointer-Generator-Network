Adrian Knopps survived for seven days in the Alaskan wilderness despite having just four granola bars for food, no warm clothing and no shelter

A Michigan hunter survived for a week in the Alaskan wilderness with just four granola bars, no shelter and no warm clothing on just three hours of sleep.

Adrian Knopps, a 51-year-old electrician from Grand Ledge, ate one bar a day until he ran out, and survived a 70mph storm by lashing himself to tree roots.

He also carved a farewell note on the butt of his rival in the hope that someone passing by might relay his fate to his family.

Knopps became stranded in September while on a 10-day trip up the Chickamin river after his partner Garrett Hagen, 24, drowned.

He survived for seven days under constant threat of being attacked by wolves and bears.

Knopps eventually collapsed, suffering from hypothermia, hallucinating and on the verge of death.

He prayed to God for help, and two hours later he was found by a coastguard helicopter.

'It probably was the most wonderful sound I ever heard,' he told The Detroit News.

Cmdr. Pete Melnick, operations officer at the Coast Guard Air Station in Sitka, added: 'It's a testament to the human will to live.'

The ordeal began just three days into a 10-day hunting trip after Knopps and Hagen sailed a 50ft boat into a river delta, moored up and went ashore.

Soon after Hagen shot an 800lb grizzly bear, the pair skinned it and loaded the meat on to a small skiff. Knopps agreed to stay on land while Hagen took the meat back in the smaller vessel.

However, Hagen never returned. After 11 days search and rescue teams found his body 30 miles away, and believe he drowned while trying to get into the boat.

Meanwhile Knopps was left in a desperate situation. His warm clothing, mobile and other supplies were all aboard the bigger boat, but with the skiff missing he had no way of getting to them without freezing to death in the ice-cold water.

He also knew that, as the trip was due to last for seven days more, it would be at least that long before anyone knew he was missing or came looking for him.

Knowing he was in for a long wait Knopps moved on to higher ground where he survived his way through continuous rain and a storm by lashing himself to tree roots.

While he was lost Adrian says he spent a lot of time thinking about his wife, Maria (left), his two grown sons, and his granddaughter Natalie, 6 (centre)

Knopps survived through constant rain and a 70mph storm on the Chickamin river by lashing his arm to a tree. He couldn't lie down because of the flooded ground and got a total of just three hours sleep

During the storm the boat, which Knopps had hoped would lead rescuers to him, broke its mooring and began to float away.

He had just four granola bars for sustenance which he ate, one a day, until they were gone. He didn't lay down the entire time because the ground was sodden and slept for a total of just three hours.

Knopps says he spoke aloud to God constantly and thought about his wife, two sons and granddaughter.

He carved a note into the butt of his rifle in the hope that somebody would find it and pass it to his family. It said : 'A Knopps stuck on river tidal flat for 5 days. Cold wet no food. Garrett Hagen, Craig, AK died taking big bear to boat 9-15-13.'

Rescuers were eventually alerted after seven days when they found Hagen's boat adrift and located Knopps several hours later

He was eventually found after the coastguard spotted the boat adrift and came looking for him, finding him barely alive with swollen joints and fingers.

Now recovered, he still suffers nerve damage, which is expected to disappear in time, and cannot walk a long distance without resting.

However that hasn't stopped him from going back to the forest. Two months after his rescue he went on an annual hunting trip with his brother and brother-in-law in the Wisconsin woods where he shot five deer.

'I love hunting. I love the woods,' he said. 'I can’t just stop doing the things I really like in life.'
