Mexico coach Miguel Herrera has left Manchester United forward Javier 'Chicharito' Hernandez on the bench for Friday's World Cup opener against Cameroon.

Herrera has chosen Villarreal forward Guillermo Dos Santos and Oribe Peralta to start in attack for the Group A encounter in Natal, Brazil.

He also ended speculation as to who will start in goal with Ajaccio's Guillermo Ochoa selected ahead of Jesus Corona of Cruz Azul.

'I know that all of my players are going to leave their soul on the pitch to achieve a result,' Herrera said. 'We are ready to go out and win.'

With Brazil and Croatia also included in the pool, Mexico know how vital Friday's game is.

The Aztecs have failed to reach the knock-out round in the past five tournaments.

'This is a very important game for us, key to our aspirations to progress to the next round,' Herrera said. 'We know it's not going to be easy but we are going to work very hard to beat Cameroon.'

Mexico will have to show a vast improvement as they suffered 1-0 defeats in their last two friendlies against Bosnia and Herzegovina and Portugal.

'We are only interested in a win and not on the actual result,' he said. 'A win is what matters, taking three points and that is what we want.'

Mexico had to beat New Zealand in the play-offs to reach Brazil and maintain their record of qualifying for every World Cup since 1990.

Herrera believes Cameroon's pace poses the biggest danger for his side.

'They have a very good team, with fast players, who have experience,' he said. 'We will try to manage possession.'

Shining light: Samuel Eto'o will captain Cameroon as he plays in his fourth World Cup

Cameroon go into the encounter at the Estadio das Dunas finally able to focus on football matters.

Volker Finke's squad threatened to refuse to board the plane to Brazil due to a row over bonuses before a deal was finally reached.

The African side beat Moldova 1-0 last week in a friendly after previously drawing 2-2 with Germany in Monchengladbach.

'We know that (Mexico) had a lot of problems in qualifying and that it was difficult,' Finke said. 'However, they are a very dangerous team, with an intense spirit. I can see that it is a difficult team but one that can be beaten.'

Samuel Eto'o, who will compete in his fourth World Cup, is the Cameroon captain.

Since joining Manchester United in 2010, Javier Hernandez has started just over half of his Premier League games from the bench.
