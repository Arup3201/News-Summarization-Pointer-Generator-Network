Lee Smith (pictured) had sex with a female pupil on her 15th birthday before embarking on a four-year relationship with her. He has now been jailed

A teacher who got engaged to a former pupil and fathered a baby wit her when she left school has been jailed after he admitted having sex with her when she was just 15.

Lee Smith, 38, of Bedworth, Warwickshire, also fabricated details on job applications to three schools in the early 2000s, before he was employed as an IT and drama teacher.

While at one of the schools he began texting and emailing a 14-year-old girl in his class.

Warick Crown Court heard their relationship progressed and Smith lured the girl into his office where he kissed and touched her.

Smith left his wife and moved out of the marital home and the pair arranged to meet at his flat on her 15th birthday - where she lost her virginity to him.

The court heard they went on to have a long-term relationship after the victim left the school, getting engaged and having a baby together but broke up when the girl was 19.

In 2013 she underwent counselling and finally reported him to the police.

When police investigated the girl's complaints they also discovered Smith had lied on his CV when applying for teaching jobs and had inflated his GCSE grades. 

Smith pleaded guilty to three charges of sexual activity while in a position of trust and three charges of obtaining pecuniary advantage by deception.

The court heard the victim's family became concerned by his relationship with their daughter when she was at the school and asked Smith, who was in his mid-20s, to visit their home.

He told them nothing inappropriate was happening but soon after his marriage broke down and he moved into a flat on his own.

His relationship with the girl then progressed to kissing and touching and they met at his flat where they regularly had sex.

Prosecutor Ian Speed said: 'The complainant describes becoming close to Mr Smith especially after she was 14. They then began spending a lot of time together in the defendant's office after school.

'They developed feelings for each other which moved to kissing and touching each other's bodies. 

'The relationship continued and then became a fully sexual one.  

'On her 18th birthday they became engaged and had a daughter, but the relationship ended in 2005 to 2006, and apart from child contact, they went their separate ways.

'In 2013 she had counselling and that prompted her to contact the police.'

Matthew Barnes, defending, said: 'Even though it was late in the day, he did bring his head out of the sand eventually and pleaded guilty at the start of his trial.

'His health is a major feature of everyday life. He was diagnosed with severe epilepsy in 1995.

'He suffers even now from mental absences several times a day and has a 'grand mal' seizure about once a month, as well as having diabetes.

'After the relationship with the girl ended, he didn't embark with another relationship with another underage girl.

'He was emotionally immature and vulnerable, because of the deterioration of his marriage.

Recorder Christopher Hotten QC said: 'It is not surprising she felt flattered by your interest in her and eventually felt herself to be in love with you.

'The burgeoning of this relationship was all too apparent to your wife and her parents.

'They all tried to discourage you and warn you off, but you lied to them and pursued the relationship behind their backs.

'You left it up to the victim to choose when you first had sex but in reality sex was inevitable.

'You had provided misleading information about qualifications and you shouldn't have been a teacher at all.

'You misrepresented your qualifications because you knew you wouldn't get the jobs otherwise.'

The recorder added: 'The victim should have been pursuing sport and academic activities both of which she excelled at, but she was concentrating on you.

'She says you discouraged her academic activities and friendships with friends her own age.'

Smith was jailed for 18 months for the three sexual offences, to run consecutively with a six-month jail term for the deception charges.
