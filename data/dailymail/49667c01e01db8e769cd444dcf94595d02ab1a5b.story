Blackpool owner Owen Oyston has insisted that his family are not using the club as a cash cow and are not in the process of asset stripping the Seasiders.

Oyston - alongside son Karl, who is chairman - has presided over the worst year in the club’s recent history. There have been major disputes with Jose Riga over transfer policy and the new manager could have lost his job on a number of occasions since taking over before pre-season.

Riga was dealt a bucketload of trialists before the Championship campaign kicked off and only landed one of his original targets, Costa Rican midfielder Jose Cubero.

Major criticism has been levelled at the Oystons for perceived greed. But Owen, now 80, refutes the claims.

‘It’s simply not true we have asset stripped or misappropriated football generated funds,’ he told the Blackpool Gazette.

‘If those responsible for these allegations had examined the accounts of the football group they would have seen we had been building up substantial assets to strengthen and secure the football club over 27 years, protecting the club from debt and producing revenue income and more recently substantial profits for the football group.

‘We are one of the few clubs in the football world that have no debts and are in profit.’

The reason they have no debts, of course, is the overt unwillingness to compete on a financial level with the rest of the second tier in the transfer market. The £300,000 spent on Cubero - a small fee in football’s wider spectrum - is one of only two occasions they have sanctioned the purchase of a player in the last two years.

The Blackpool fans are planning a mass protest ahead of the Cardiff game this Friday night

The timing of Oyston’s interview - he rarely speaks - won’t be lost on supporters, who plan mass protests against the regime during the home game against Cardiff on Friday night. This will only add fuel to an ever-expanding fire, made all the more fierce by chronic results on the pitch. Riga’s side lie at the foot of the table and are staring relegation in the face.

Oyston, however, still bizarrely believes they can make the play-offs.

The club still train at the shambolic base at Squires Gate - largely unchanged since the 1950s. It was labelled a ‘hell hole’ by Ian Holloway five years ago and remains the same today. To sum up the lack of pride, a sign reading: ‘Blackpool Football Club Centre of Excellance (sic)’ has not been removed, remaining at front of house for years.

While supporters have always accepted the Oystons run the club differently to the rest of the Football League, the alarming figures released through the family’s various accounts have created a swell of ill-feeling.

The Oystons transferred £26m into companies they owned since Blackpool’s unexpected promotion  in 2010

It was revealed that the Oystons transferred £26million into companies they owned since Blackpool’s unexpected promotion to the Premier League in 2010. That included an £11m payment to Owen himself.

Club president Valeri Belokon paid for the erection of the latest stand to be built, named after Jimmy Armfield.

But Oyston continued: ‘Blackpool FC Ltd couldn’t have financed the stands and paid to finish them off. That money went to Segesta (the name of Blackpool’s parent company, including properties) and was then used through various other companies to carry out the work. We had to have separate construction companies to do it.

‘Part was also used to repay loans made to the football group by Oyston Group companies interest free at a time when no-one else would lend money to the football group and without which they could not have continued.’
