If the bad weather and onset of winter has left you feeling a little below par, a new app that claims to help you feel happy all week long could be just what you need.

Developed by technicians at Google's London HQ, the HappyHealthy app offers mood-boosting advice as well as tips on how to keep the blues at bay.

The app also tracks your moods, allowing you to pinpoint misery triggers and nip them in the bud before a black mood begins.

Mood booster: Makers of the HappyHeathy app say it can improve mental wellbeing by 20 per cent

'The app's main message is that "happiness is an inside job" and that our nutrition and lifestyle 
choices affect our happy hormones more than life events,' explains marketing manager, Rebecca Molinoff.

'We should be 
hunting for the best fuels and exercises for our mind and body in order 
to maximise our health and restore our bodies to a natural state of 
wellbeing.Â 

'Many of us know this but changing habits is difficult so 
HappyHealthy App has been cleverly designed to do just this with 
non-intrusive, "little and often" reminders, and is the must-have 
digital friend for any modern day man or woman.'

Developers of the app, which is available free to those with iPhones, worked with the NHS Choices advice service to put together the tips provided by the app.

Stress: The new app is aimed at people struggling with stress and anxiety

They say they expect the programme to prove popular with those suffering from stress and anxiety as well as people who find it hard to switch off thanks to their busy lifestyles.

According to company figures, the app produces an average increase in happiness of 12 per cent in the first week, rising to 20 per cent when used over three months.

'We know that one of the greatest challenges for any app developer is getting users to stay interested,' added Molinoff.

'We believe we have effectively overcome this hurdle with the easy to use interface, the volume of great tips and expert guidance.

'Fortunately, mental health is no longer a taboo subject and the app is proven to help users improve theirs, which makes for continuous engagement.

'We want the app to help users avoid prolonged stress and anxiety and maximise the feel good factor.

'It is great for anyone who suffers from low moods that can't be explained, feels stuck with thoughts that are irrational but can't be shaken off and for those who want to be less irritable in a good mood more of the time.'
