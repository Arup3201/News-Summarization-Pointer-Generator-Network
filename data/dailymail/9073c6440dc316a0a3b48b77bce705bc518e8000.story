As a beautiful orange sky lit up fields of morning mist today, Britain found itself in the midst a typical autumnal week.

The picture-perfect scene was captured near Bruton, Somerset, while swans were pictured in flight during a misty morning close to Arundel, West Sussex.

A band of cloud and rain will spread north-eastwards across Britain tomorrow, and is likely to be heavy in parts, reaching northern Scotland by night.

What a start: An orange sky lights up fields of morning mist near Bruton in Somerset. A band of cloud and rain will spread north-eastwards across Britain tomorrow

As the rain clears from the South West, sunshine and showers will develop - and Thursday will see a mixture of sunny intervals and scattered showers.

Met Office forecaster Dan Williams said: ‘Tonight will start dry but by the early hours of the morning we’ll see a rain front pushing in from the South West.' 

He told MailOnline: ‘This will bring about 10 to 15mm (0.4 to 0.6in) in the West. Once that rain front comes through, we’ll see dry and brighter conditions.

‘In the South West by midday tomorrow we’ll start to see some brighter clearer spells. Top temperatures could be about 16 to 17C in the South.

‘It will be showery on Thursday and on Friday some periods of more prolonged rain are possible. It’s very typical for the time of year.’

Mr Williams said temperatures on Thursday and Friday are likely to top 17C, which is above the average maximum for this time of year of 13C.

The weekend is expected to bring a mixture of sunshine and showers - conditions that would be expected for this time of year, he added.

The Met Office has not posted any severe weather warnings for the next four days, and the Environment Agency has no active flood alerts in place.
