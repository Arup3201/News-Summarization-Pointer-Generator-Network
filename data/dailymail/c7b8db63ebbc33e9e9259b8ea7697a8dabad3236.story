With a litany of legal actions brought against him over the years, Silvio Berlusconi would be the first to tell you he’s had a rough time in the law courts.

But the former Italian premier has finally found a court that is on his side- a judge in Monza has cut his alimony payments in half - to a mere £1.2million a month.

He had previously been ordered to pay ex-wife Veronica Lario, whom he first met when he saw her topless on stage, a cool £2.5million a month.

The former actress had also wanted the £60million family villa but Mr Berlusconi, 77, whose personal fortune is estimated at £3.7billion, kept the villa near Milan as well as control of his business empire.

The playboy politician has complained bitterly about the payments which add up to £82,000 a day or £30million a year stating that the 'ridiculous settlement' was a scandal, decided by three 'feminist and communist' judges.

Miss Lario filed for divorce in 2009 after Berlusconi was photographed at an underwear model's 18th birthday party.

She said she could no longer stay with someone who spent time with 'minors' and pointed out that he had never turned up to any of his own children's 18th birthday parties. 

New love: Berlusconi is now engaged to Francesca Pascale

Earlier in the year the billionaire had been forced to take out full-page adverts in the newspapers to apologise to her for telling a guest at a TV awards dinner that he wanted to marry her.

'If I wasn't married, I would marry you right away, ' he told showgirl turned politician Mara Carfagna. 

Berlusconi was married to Miss Lario for the best part of 20 years and has three children with her - Barbara, 29, Eleonora, 27, and Luigi, 25.

He was previously married to Carla Elvira Dell’Oglio with whom he had his first two children Marina, 47, and Pier Silvio, 44.

The controversial entrepeneur is now engaged to marry 28-year-old former TV showgirl Francesca Pascale.

Despite the legal victory, Berlusconi is still appealing two convictions, one for sex with an underage prostitute and one for illegally publishing police phone taps.
