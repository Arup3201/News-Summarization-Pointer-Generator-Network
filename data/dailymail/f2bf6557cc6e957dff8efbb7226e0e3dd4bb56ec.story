Far from the maddening roar of Formula One, Daniel Ricciardo's preparations for the Japan Grand Prix took a peaceful turn as the Red Bull driver visited sacred temples in Tokyo.

The Australian, who stands third in the F1 drivers' championship, tried his hand at the ancient Zen Bhuddist meditation discipline of Zazen on Wednesday as he explored the Shinto area of Japan's capital.

Ricciardo, 25, also took part in a Japanese Shinto prayer at the nearby Asakusa Shrine, one of the area's most famous holy buildings known also as the Sanja-sama, or Shrine of the Three gods.

It was a major change of pace for Ricciardo, who's been a revelation in a debut season with Red Bull that's seen his three race wins and seven podiums overshadow team-mate Sebastian Vettel, the four-times consecutive champion.

With five races left in the season, starting with Suzuka on Sunday, Lewis Hamilton holds a narrow lead over his Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg, with Ricciardo a further 57 points adrift.

But with the Brit and the German set to continue their season's battle for the top spot until the last race in Abu Dhabi, many pundits already consider Ricciardo the big winner.

Former F1 team owner Eddie Jordan says the Aussie has been a revelation for the sport.

'He's one of the best things to happen to F1 in a very long time,' Jordan told the BBC's website in a Q&A with readers.

'He is the surprise package of the year. If you'd said to me at the beginning of the year that this guy would win three races and Vettel would win none, I would have said you were dreaming.'

While he doesn't think Ricciardo can win, the lad from Perth has every intention to chase the next rung on the podium come year's end.

Even with mechanical issues - including a battering malfunction on lap one - hindering his run last time out in Singapore, he managed to salvage third place at the Marina Bay Circuit.

A lack of power meant that although he caught up to Vettel, he couldn't find a way past his team-mate who finished in second.

'We definitely had a few issues and we tried fixing them but, to be honest, we didn't quite clear it all up,' Ricciardo said after the race.

'I was a bit frustrated, a bit concerned as well that we wouldn't get it to the flag, but luckily it held on.

'We'll just have look at it and I'm sure we'll fix it for Japan.'

Ricciardo goes into the last five races of the season 57 points behind second-placed Nico Rosberg, while Lewis Hamilton is in the lead by just three points
