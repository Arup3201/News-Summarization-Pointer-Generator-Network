Wants answers: New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman (pictured) has launched an investigation into Macy's and Barneys after customers complained they had been racially profiled by the retailers

The New York attorney general has launched an investigation into claims that retail giants Barneys and Macy's racially profiled customers in their 'stop-and-frisk' policies.

Eric Schneiderman's office has sent letters to both stores yesterday demanding information on its practices for detaining and questioning suspects based on their race.

It comes after four people have come forward with allegations against the two companies.

In letters to Barneys CEO Mark Lee and Macy's Chief Stores Officer Peter Sachse, the head of the AG's civil rights bureau, Kristen Clarke, wrote: 'Attorney General Schneiderman is committed to ensuring that all New York residents are afforded equal protection under the law.

'The alleged repeated behavior of your employees raises troubling questions about your company’s commitment to that ideal.'

The letters, which have been seen by the New York Daily News, gives them until Friday to supply the information.

In her letter to Macy's, Clarke notes that the claims were even more serious because the company had previously been accused of similar tactics.

The state attorney general's office filed a federal lawsuit against the company in 2005 claiming that it racially profiled black and Hispanic customers.

Although the firm denied any wrongdoing at the time, it agreed to pay $600,000 in damages.

It also created the role of security monitor, developed rules on handcuffing and kept a database of all detentions.

'Given this prior settlement agreement, these new allegations are particularly troublesome,' Clarke’s letter says.

Shocking: Trayon Christian, 19, left, and Kayla Phillips, 21, claim they were interrogated by police after buying expensive items from Barneys

Yesterday, it was revealed that furious Facebook users had vented their anger over the recent profiling of shoppers in Barneys.

It came after a fourth person came forward with similar claims, this time against Macy's - the second in a week.

Palmer says four plainclothes cops questioned him three blocks away 
from the flagship store after he bought $320 worth of Polo dress shirts 
and ties in April.

The 
latest accusation echoes those by Trayon Christian and Kayla Phillips 
against Barneys and by actor Robert Brown against the same Macy’s.

Palmer, a 56-year-old exercise trainer from Crown Heights, Brooklyn, said he made the purchase without incident, using both his Macy’s platinum card and his American Express card.

He was walking to a gym on Park Avenue when police surrounded him and demanded to see his ID.

The officers said they were suspicious because they had lost sight of him on the store’s surveillance cameras, he said.

When asked if he believed he was racially profiled, he told the New York Daily News that there was 'no other reason'.

He was allowed to continue on his way after he showed his receipt for the duds and the cards with which he purchased them.

When
Palmer returned to the store the next day to complain, a Macy’s manager
blamed it on the cops and said officers frequently come into the store 
to monitor surveillance videos without permission, according to Palmer.

Two
black Barneys customers said this week they were detained by police 
after making expensive purchases, while last week actor Robert Brown 
said he was paraded through Macy’s Herald Square store in handcuffs and 
detained for an hour after being racially profiled and accused of using a
stolen credit card to buy his mother a $1,350 watch.

Brown, one of the stars of HBO show Treme, was released after being in cuffs for about 45 minutes without any charges.

He’s suing the store and the NYPD, charging cops racially profiled him and violated his constitutional rights.

Fashion megastar Tyson Beckford, 42, told PIX11 on Thursday that he frequently gets judged on the color of his skin in Barney's and other places.

'I
might have the most recognizable face in the world. I still get 
followed all the time, any time I go to a store,' Beckford said outside 
Barney's.

Trayon
Christian, 19, is suing Barneys, saying he was accosted by undercover NYPD 
officers after using his debit card to buy a $349 Ferragamo belt in 
April.

Kayla Phillips, 21, 
said she was surrounded and interrogated by police after purchasing a 
$2,500 handbag from Barneys in February.

On Barneys' Facebook wall, users have posted their opinions, said the New York Daily News.

'Love these shoes ... but having dark skin, my hard earned money may not be enough to allow the purchase at this establishment,’ Facebook user Amelia Rios Alex wrote on the page, which features glitzy photos of shoes, perfume, jewelry and apparel.

Anger: Furious Facebook users attacked Barneys' website over what they call 'modern racism', including the likes of rapper, Jay Z

Barneys' menswear ad was bombarded with angry comments

An ad for a John Varvatos suit with the tagline, Modern Monochrome, attracted 72 people to vent about the profiling scandal.

‘Modern racism,' said John Renaud.

‘Monochrome is right. Whites only’, according to David Nieves.

‘Will I get arrested if I buy this?’ asked Ramona Morgan.

‘Do handcuffs [come] with this or are they sold separately?’ said Facebook user Glenny Lennox.

Civil rights activist Reverend Al Sharpton has
threatened protests against Barneys and a possible 
boycott for 'upscale racial profiling'.

'In major cities like New York, blacks 
and Latinos not only worry about being “stopped-and-frisked” by police, 
but they also fear the embarrassment of being “shopped-and-frisked” in 
retail stores,' he said in an opinion piece for the New York Daily News.

'Perhaps
all retailers need a friendly reminder of the immense buying power of 
blacks and minorities. We will definitely remember those who welcome us 
and those who would rather profile us, and we will speak loudly with our
dollars — bottom line.'

we 
ever naively believe that our work is done?' Sharpton wrote.

Sharpton said it was a 'travesty' that police and retailers interrogate black people who buy expensive items.

'Barneys,
a high-end retailer with stores in major cities, must answer for this 
pattern of biased behavior, as must the NYPD,' he wrote.

'Our
National Action Network (NAN) Brooklyn chapter President Kirsten John 
Foy said it best when he called Barneys’ behavior schizophrenic. On the 
one hand, they want to expand their brand to the urban market, but then 
they turn around and see us as suspects rather than prospects.

'Barneys
and other retailers that openly discriminate against us must be held 
accountable. Simply apologizing isn’t enough; we need to see a plan of 
action as to how they are going to rectify their ways.'

Accountability: Sharpton said Barneys, a high-end retailer with stores in major cities, must answer for its 'pattern of biased behavior'

Sharpton has demanded
a meeting with Barneys CEO, Mark Lee, and is 'currently mobilizing 
activists for peaceful direct-action against the store and the NYPD.'

Earlier this week, Lee said the company had retained a civil rights expert to help review its procedures and offered his 'sincere regret and deepest apologies'.

'Barneys
New York has zero tolerance for any form of discrimination and we stand
by our long history in support of all human rights,' Barneys said in a 
statement.

In his comment piece, Sharpton also highlighted the experiences of 'Treme' actor, Rob Brown, and Oscar-winning actor Forest Whitaker.

Brown claimed he was paraded through 
Macy’s Herald Square in handcuffs and placed in a holding cell because 
an employee suspected that his credit card didn’t belong to him in June,

Whitaker said he was accused of stealing and patted down after leaving a store in Morningside Heights.

'When international celebrities can be 
disrespected and mistreated in such a humiliating manner, how can we 
ever naively believe that our work is done?' Sharpton wrote.
