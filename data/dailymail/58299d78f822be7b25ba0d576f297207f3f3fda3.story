The Taliban has hit out at Pakistani media for showing a lack of patriotism by heaping too much praise on retiring Indian cricketer Sachin Tendulkar.

In a bizarre rant, the terror groups' spokesman urged the Press instead to praise much criticised Pakistani cricket captain Misbah-ul-Haq.

Shahidullah Shahid admitted that Tendulkar, who played for arch rivals India, was a 'great player' but added that positive coverage of him is 'against Pakistan's nationalism'.

The extraordinary interview also saw Shahid condemn coverage of the death of former Taliban leader Hakimullah Mehsud who was killed in a drone strike earlier this month.

Sat with balaclava-clad armed men either side of him, Shahid said: 'There is an Indian player, his name is Tendulkar.

'Pakistani media have praised him too much. On the other hand they have condemned Misbah-ul-Haq a lot.

'Now people should tell the media that it may be true that Tendulkar is a great player, but the media should not talk about his greatness because this is against Pakistan's nationalism and patriotism.

Shahid went on to defend Pakistani player Misbah, who has been criticised for his conservative style of play.

He said: 'And Misbah, even if he is the worst player, media should praise him because he is a Pakistani.'

His criticism of the Press was prompted by Tendulkar's retirement from test cricket two weeks ago.

Tendulkar brought the curtain down on a 24-year career which has seen him play more Tests and score more runs than any man in history as India claimed a comfortable win over the West Indies in his 200th and final game for his country.

The retirement of the 40-year-old, who is regarded by some as the greatest post-war batsman to have graced the game, was met with gushing praise from commentators in the Pakistani media.

He was described as a 'genius without peer' by the Dawn newspaper with an Express Tribune blogger describing his sporting aptitude as 'supernatural, according to the Daily Telegraph.

Shahid said that the media should praise much-criticised Pakistani cricket captain Misbah-ul-Haq regardless of his ability but because of his nationality
