We've divided the Premier League into teams from the north and south of England - with Welsh side Swansea included in the south. 

Joe Bernstein had the choice to pick any players from the north, in any formation, with no limit on how many from each club.

Rob Draper picked his South XI on Monday, and you can read that here.

Here's how we split the clubs: 

 

South

Arsenal, Aston Villa, Chelsea, Crystal Palace, Leicester City, QPR, Southampton, Swansea City, Spurs, West Brom, West Ham United

North

Burnley, Everton, Hull City, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United, Newcastle United, Stoke City, Sunderland 

North vs South. It is perhaps the fiercest argument between the people of England.

But without dipping into the political allegiances, property prices and weather, we're sticking to the ultimate debating point – football.

This week we are starting a new North vs South debate - who would you pick and who would win?

In the NBA, each season they stage an All-Star match that pits the best from the West against the cream of the East.

And wouldn't it be fascinating if the Premier League adopted a similar event?

Yesterday, Rob Draper selected his South XI. 

Here, Joe Bernstein reveals his North XI - plus seven subs.

Then on Wednesday, we'll reveal who would win the match thanks to our friends at Football Manager.

And, as always, we want you to tell us who you would have picked in your team... 

Goalkeeper: Joe Hart (Manchester City) Tough call between David de Gea and Hart, but the City stopper is better at organising his defenders and more commanding in the air. And, as he showed against Lionel Messi, he can stop a penalty too. 

Right back: Daryl Janmaat (Newcastle United) Been outstanding this season and Toon fans will have an anxious wait this summer to see if a bigger club snaps him up. Janmaat can also play in the centre of the defence but he's most threatening down the right where his crosses would cause havoc to any rearguard. Creative player too.

Centre half: Ryan Shawcross (Stoke City) Would surely have been an England regular if he played for a more glamorous club than Stoke. Better than Gary Cahill or Phil Jagielka, less injury-prone than Phil Jones. This team is so crammed with attacking talent, the two centre-halves are in purely to defend. And they're good at that. 

Joe Hart has been superb in the league and showed against Barcelona he can do it in Europe too

Daryl Janmaat has been outstanding this season and Newcastle fans will have an anxious wait this summer

Centre half: Martin Skrtel (Liverpool) Totally fearless, he keeps putting his head and body in the way of danger - just what you want from a centre-half. Useful in both penalty areas at set-pieces too, he gets his fair share of goals for a defender. Him and Shawcross wouldn't let anything pass, allowing the two full backs to push up. 

Left back: Leighton Baines (Everton) Just gets better and better with age. Fantastic at set-pieces, both delivery and shooting, and so calm on the ball. Has got over the disappointment of not joining Manchester United and it's no coincidence Everton hit their dodgy patch when he was out of the team injured. 

Right wing: Raheem Sterling (Liverpool) Showed at the last World Cup he has now taken over Wayne Rooney's mantle as the best player in the England team and it's hard to believe he is still only 20. The one player in Roy Hodgson's squad that you think could actually make it with Real Madrid or Barcelona, he is quick, skilful, has natural balance and courage on and off the ball

Central midfield: Michael Carrick (Manchester United) People ask why Manchester United's form has improved in the last couple of matches. Simple, Michael Carrick is back from injury and making the team tick. Always seems to know when to play the right pass, and makes average players around him look good and the good players look great 

Central midfield: James McCarthy (Everton) If this team has steel down the middle in Skrtel and Shawcross, and stealth in Carrick, McCarthy adds speed. He can cover ground to make tackles and when he needs to use the ball, the Irishman is neat and tidy. One of Roberto Martinez's best signings and no wonder bigger clubs want him. 

Left midfield: David Silva (Manchester City) With Leighton Baines behind him, Silva wouldn't have to hug the left-hand touchline like a traditional winger, he would start from there, link up with Baines at times but also drift inside and drop grenades infield. On his day, a hugely talented and influential player. Juan Mata is rightly getting plaudits at the moment, in Spain they say Silva is better.

Striker: Sergio Aguero (Manchester City) Has taken over Luis Suarez's mantle as the best player in the league. Absolutely lethal against any type of opposition as his hat-trick against Bayern Munich showed in the Champions League. May be asked to leave the penalties to Leighton Baines though after his fluffed effort in the Nou Camp.

Striker: Wayne Rooney (captain) (Manchester United) Rooney has often formed good strike partnerships with players who are of similar build and technique, Henrik Larsson springs to mind in his brief spell at Manchester United, so I have no doubts he would be prolific with Sergio Aguero. I can see them being on the same wavelength and Rooney would spot the Argentine's runs early.

Subs

Asmir Begovic (Stoke): Another in the Hart mould; big, commanding, won't leave his defenders alone.

Pablo Zabaleta (Manchester City): If you need someone to see out the final 20 minutes, he's perfect.

Phil Jones (Manchester United): Another who can put his body in the way if you're defending for your life.

Yaya Toure (Manchester City): Totally unpredictable, if you don't know how he's going to play, how can the opposition?

Ashley Young (Manchester United): Coming into some great form, can play right or left, and will track back when needed.

Daniel Sturridge (Liverpool): A great impact sub, can score in instant with his quick feet

Robin van Persie (Manchester United): Been written off this season, but it's less than a year ago he scored that header in World Cup.

(4-2-3-1): Courtois, Clyne,  Fonte, Terry, Azpilicueta; Matic, Schneiderlin; Sanchez, Cazorla, Hazard; Kane. 

Subs: Green, Ivanovic, Koscielny, Delph, Bolasie, Costa, Giroud

(4-4-2): Hart; Janmaat, Shawcross, Skrtel, Baines; Sterling, Carrick, McCarthy, Silva; Aguero, Rooney

Subs: Begovic, Zabaleta, Phil Jones, Yaya Toure, Young, Sturridge, Van Persie
