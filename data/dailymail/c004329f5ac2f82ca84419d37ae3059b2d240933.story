Barack Obama has said that young Americans should be more worried about climate change than whether smoking pot was legal.

The US President said the legalization of marijuana should come at the bottom of a long list of priorities for youths which also included the economy, war and peace.

He was asked in an interview whether he legalising the drug would be part of his legacy as leader.

Obama has said that young Americans should be worried about a lot more than whether smoking pot is legal

But Obama, who has previously admitted he used to smoke cannabis as a youngster, told Vice: 'First of all, it shouldn't be youngest people's biggest priority. Young people, I understand this is important to you, but you should be thinking about climate change, the economy, jobs, war and peace - maybe way at the bottom you should be thinking about marijuana.'

So far, four states and the District of Columbia have legalized some recreational use of the drug, and 23 states and D.C. permit its use for medicinal purposes.

But Obama said that the US justice system was 'skewed' towards non-violent drug offenders and the 'disproportionate' prison sentence came at the huge cost to communities and the state.

The President has come out in favour of decriminalization as a way to tackle the skewed system but said he felt that the issue was very separate from encouraging people to use marijuana

He added that he felt 'encouraged' by the numbers of politicians, including conservative Republicans, who were beginning to see the cost of keeping the drug illegal didn't add up.

Obama has been very open about his past experimentation with drugs and alcohol in high school.

In 2006, then a New Hampshire Democratic presidential candidate, Obama was asked about his use of marijuana.

 When asked if he inhaled- a reference to former President Bill Clinton who, while admitting to trying marijuana, claimed he did not inhale - the future President said: 'I did. That was the point. 

'It's not something I'm proud of. It was a mistake as a young man.' 

Obama also suggested that if medical marijuana was the best way to relieve pain and suffering then it was something he would be open to. 

'We may actually be able to make progress on the decriminalization side,' he added, 'At a certain point, if enough states end up decriminalizing, then Congress may then re-schedule marijuana.'

But while he appeared to take steps towards decriminalization, Obama warned legalization wasn't a 'panacea' and there will still many who had concerns about the drug's affect on society. 

There are currently 23 states and D.C. which allows marijuana  for medicinal purposes.

The Controlled Substances Act on 1970 listed marijuana as a Schedule I drug making it illegal to manufacture, distribute or possess marijuana in the United States.

But in August 2013, the U.S. Justice Department confirmed it wouldn't challenge Colorado or other states with laws legalizing recreational marijuana.

Punishment for people found in possession of the drug currently depends on the location they were caught.

For example, in Colorado, individuals aged over 21 can carry up to one ounce of cannabis and growing up to six marijuana plants at home without prosecution.

The increasingly relaxed stance on the drug has seen a rise in the numbers of states looking to decriminalize or legalize the drug.  

In last year alone, Alaska, and Oregon voted to legalize recreational marijuana, which came into force this year, and Maryland became the 18th state to decriminalize the drug. 

Minnesota and New York became the 22nd and 23rd state to legalize medical marijuana in some form.

They are likely to be swiftly followed by others next year when ballot initiatives in California, Massachusetts, Maine, Nevada and Arizona other states are likely to be put to voters. 

Only this month, a trio of senators unveiled a package of drug reforms that would effectively end the federal war on medical marijuana. While it wouldn't legalize it, the bill would remove the threat of federal prosecution for patients who use it in states where it is legal.
