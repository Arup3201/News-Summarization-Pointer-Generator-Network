An 'American airplane pilot' with 'Latino roots' has been detained by Venezuela's government, accusing of spying and recruiting citizens to stage a coup, President Nicolas Maduro declared.

The President said the pilot, who has not been named, was part of a group of six U.S. nationals arrested in the state of Táchira, near the Colombian border, in the last few days.

Addressing a rally on Saturday, Maduro said the man had 'documentation' that suggested he was involved in 'espionage' and 'recruitment'. 

It comes after four missionaries were questioned over alleged 'spying' after running a medical assistance campaign in the coastal town of Ocumare de la Costa.

Claims: President Nicolas Maduro claims an American pilot has been detained in Caracas suspected of spying

A spokesman for the U.S. embassy in Caracas said he was unable to comment, citing a lack of any official diplomatic communication with the Venezuelan government. 

Maduro, Hugo Chavez's left wing successor, has waged a bitter war of words against the U.S. in recent weeks.

Last week he accused the White House - which he dubbed 'arrogant Yankees' - of trying to overthrow him. The Obama administration vehemently denied the charge.

In his latest attack, Maduro said his government will prohibit some U.S. officials from entering Venezuela in retaliation for a similar measure by the government of President Barack Obama against a group of Venezuelan public officials.

He said U.S. tourists will also be subject to hefty visa fees - akin to those Venezuelans must pay to visit America.

The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 2010. Nonetheless, they have continued to exchange diplomatic staff. On Saturday, Maduro said the U.S. has far more officials in Venezuela than his socialist government has in the U.S.

'They have 100 diplomats and we have 17,' Maduro said.

In an address that all Venezuelan television and radio stations were required to carry, Maduro addressed Obama directly, saying the U.S. president has 'arrogantly' refused to engage in talks to resolve the issues between the two countries.

'I'm very sorry, Mr. President, that you have gone down this dead end,' he said.

Maduro asked that the changes regulating diplomats be implemented immediately, within the limits of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations. Among other things, U.S. diplomats will be required to seek approval from the Foreign Ministry for meetings they conduct here.

The news comes amid rising tensions between the U.S. and Venezuela and a surge in anti-government protests in the capital, Caracas. 

He recently called on other Latin American nations to form a coalition to investigate America for 'human rights violations'.

It is not clear if the pilot is one of the six U.S. nationals arrested recently, all accused of espionage by President Nicolas Maduro.

The head of a Venezuelan evangelical organization on Friday said a group of four missionaries had been called in for questioning after participating in a medical assistance campaign in the coastal town of Ocumare de la Costa.

That pastor, Abdy Pereira, on Saturday said in a telephone interview that the four had left the country for Aruba after having been questioned for several days about alleged involvement in espionage. 

Pereira said the group had been coming to Venezuela 14 years and denied they were involved in espionage.
