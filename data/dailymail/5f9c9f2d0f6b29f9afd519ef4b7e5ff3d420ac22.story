Teenagers who play mature-rated, risk-glorifying video games are more likely to become reckless drivers who suffer more car accidents, police stops and are more tempted to drink and drive.

The claim was made in research by the American Psychological Association, which said certain games may increase rebelliousness and sensation-seeking among adolescents.

Lead author Jay Hull, of Dartmouth College, New Hampshire, said: 'Popular games that increase reckless driving may constitute even more of
 a public health issue than the widely touted association of video games
 and aggression.'

The researchers conducted a long-term study involving more than 5,000 
U.S. teenagers, who answered a series of questions over four years in 
four waves of telephone interviews.

Fifty per cent of the teens reported in the first interview that their 
parents allowed them to play mature-rated games and among those, 32 
per cent said they had played Spiderman II, 12 per cent had played Manhunt
 and 58 per cent had played Grand Theft Auto III.

Playing video games 
such as Grand Theft Auto III, Manhunt and Spiderman II was associated 
with increases in sensation seeking, rebelliousness and self-reported 
risky driving, the study said.

'Most parents would probably be disturbed to learn that we observed that this type of game play was more strongly associated with teen drivers being pulled over by the police than their parenting practices,' said Hull.

'With motor vehicle accidents the No. 1 cause of adolescent deaths, popular games that increase reckless driving may constitute even more of a public health issue than the widely touted association of video games and aggression.'

Grand Theft Auto IV was a critically-acclaimed 18-rated game, but there were concerns about younger players emulating the violence they saw on-screen

Between the second and third interviews, teens who said they had been pulled over by the police increased from 11 per cent to 21 per cent; those who said they had a car accident went from 8 per cent to 14 per cent.

In the third interview, when the teens were about 16 years old, 25 per cent said 'yes' when asked if they engaged in any unsafe driving habits.

In the final interview when the teens were about 18, 90 per cent said 'yes' to at least one of the same risky driving habits:

The researchers determined the teens’ levels of sensation seeking and rebelliousness by asking them to rate themselves on a four-point scale following questions such as 'I like to do dangerous things' and 'I get in trouble at school.'

The study controlled for variables such as gender, age, race, parent income and education and parenting styles described as warm and responsive or demanding.

'Playing these kinds of video games could also result in these adolescents developing personalities that reflect the risk-taking, rebellious characters they enact in the games and that could have broader consequences that apply to other risky behaviors such as drinking and smoking,' Hull said.

The information regarding the teens’ driving habits was based on their own reports during the interviews, and therefore interpretation of the causes of their driving habits was speculative, the authors noted.

But Hull added: 'At the same time, because the study began when the participants were playing video games but were too young to drive, it is clear that the videogame exposure preceded the risky driving.'
