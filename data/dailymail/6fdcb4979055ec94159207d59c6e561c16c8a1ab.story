Actor Judd Nelson, 55, has been forced to confirm that he is alive and well after rumors swept the internet on Sunday morning that he had died overnight.

Nelson's 'death' was reported by Foxnews.es, a hoax website which has no affiliation with the television news network.

The fake story claimed that the actor, best known for his roles in '80s classics The Breakfast Club and St. Elmo’s Fire, had been found dead on Saturday night at Sierra Towers, a West Hollywood condominium block.
