Was it personal? Jonathan Saenz, while always a devout Catholic and conservative activist, did not become head of Texas's largest anti-gay group until after his wife left him for a woman

The leader of one of the largest and most vocal anti-gay groups in Texas took the group's helm soon after his wife of 9 years left him for a woman, court documents reveal.

Already a conservative firebrand attorney, Jonathan Saenz became head of Texas Values in early 2012. His wife Corinne and mother of his three young children filed for divorce in August of 2012, reports Lone Star Q.

According to divorce filings, what followed were two years of bitter legal feuding, much of which was focused on Corinne's girlfriend Ercimin Paredes and Saenz children.

During the prolonged battle, Jonathan Saenz sought to bar Paredes or any other future romantic partner of his wife's from ever having any contact or even being in the same building as his children.

The request was granted temporarily but was absent from the final divorce agreement, which would not be made until August 2013--nearly two years to the day after Corinne first filed.

Mr. Saez claimed that his wife and Paredes, her fellow teacher at Becker Elementary School in the Austin Independent School District, began a serious relationship 'as early as the fall of 2010.'

The Saenz children now split their time between parents.

Another sticking point came when Mr. Saenz demanded that both he and Corinne undergo a psychological evaluation with a psychologist of his choosing as part of the proceedings.

Corinne initially agreed until it was 
revealed that her husband's chosen evaluator charged an 'exorbitant' 
$2,500. Saez refused to pay for his wife's evaluation and the 
stipulation they use the psychologist was dropped.

Strong views: In addition to his strong support of the Boy Scouts ban on gays, Saenz has said opening he believes gay marriage will lead to people marrying their own stepchildren and that gay rights activists want to create Christian concentration camps

While the results of the evaluation are not revealed in court documents, it's Mr. Saez who the suit suggests has a history of treatment for mental illness. Lone Star Q reports:

'Jonathan Saenz sought to compel his ex-wife to produce all records in her possession â€œpertaining to the psychiatric, psychological, counseling or other mental health treatments of Jonathan Saenz, including but not limited to any documents relating to any consultations or treatments during their marriage."'

Meanwhile, Saenz and Texas Value have suported the notion that homosexuality is a mental illness by endorsing gay conversion therapy.

Saenz has also been open about his beliefs that same-sex marriage will lead not just to polygamy but also to people marrying their own stepchildren. Most recently, he and Texas Values have called for the state supreme court to overturn a decision to strike down a gay marriege ban.
