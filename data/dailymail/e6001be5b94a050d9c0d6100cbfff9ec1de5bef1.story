Skills: Some 97 per cent of university admissions officers said they prized candidates capable of producing good written English above those who show a passion for their course or evidence they can work independently

The ability to spell correctly and string sentences together is the most important quality students need to get into university after exam results, a survey reveals.

Some 97 per cent of university admissions officers said they prized candidates capable of producing good written English above those who show a passion for their course or evidence they can think and work independently.

Nearly half said having a reasonable grasp of maths was a key factor in offering them a place.

Neither English nor maths featured when the survey was first carried out in 2007.

The
findings follow a dramatic slump in the standard of both subjects among
undergraduates that has led to complaints by academics.

Six
in ten academics are now providing remedial classes for first year 
students because they arrive so poorly prepared for the demands of 
higher education.

Most involve basic lessons in writing skills to improve spelling and grammar and teach essay structure.

More
than two-fifths of employers have also reported having to teach 
school-leavers and college graduates English, maths and IT to bring them
up to the standard required to function in the workplace.

Former Tesco boss Sir Terry Leahy described school standards as 'woeful' in 2009 - the same year that Sir Stuart Rose, then chief of Marks & Spencer, said many school leavers were not 'fit for work'.

Spending on education doubled from £35.8 billion to £71 billion between 2000 and 2011, during which Britain plummeted down world rankings according to the respected Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.

The UK slipped from 8th to 28th in maths, seventh to 25th in reading and fourth to 16th in science, leaving it behind relatively poor nations like Estonia and Slovakia.

Education Secretary Michael Gove is 
introducing a new National Curriculum with tougher exams in an attempt 
to drive up standards after years of grade inflation caused by exam 
boards offering increasingly easy qualifications that flattered schools'
achievements.

The survey of
university admissions officers found 88 per cent looked for students 
who show a passion for their chosen course, 83 per cent liked to see a 
positive attitude towards study and 72 per cent valued an ability to 
work independently.

Just 35 
per cent were concerned about evidence of overcoming a difficult 
background - suggesting a resistance to social engineering which has 
seen universities being told to accept more disadvantaged students.

Less
than a third expressed a particular interest in teenagers who had held 
positions of responsibility or undertaken work experience.

Excellence in sport or involvement in community or voluntary services did not make the top ten of desirable attributes.

Jeremy Lewis of ACS International Schools, which spoke to 80 admissions officers in the UK and 20 in the U.S. for the study, said: 'Students spend an age crafting their personal statements, so it's useful to see exactly which attributes really hit the mark with admissions teams.

'Much seems to boil down to an ability to communicate their passion and a drive to work hard, though it's interesting to see the very strong emphasis placed on good written English, suggesting perhaps this is not always a given.'

Two thirds of admissions officers also said the International Baccalaureate Diploma was best for preparing people for university, compared to 25 per cent for A-levels - indicating the gold standard exam has lost its lustre.

Meanwhile, another survey found children are familiar with IT jargon that is 'completely alien' to most adults.

Nine in ten children aged seven to 14 knew HTML stands for 'HyperText Markup Language' and three-quarters correctly said URL stands for 'Uniform Resource Locator', according to research by exam revision service Education Quizzes.

Yet half couldn't say who invaded England in 1066 and 44 per cent didn't know which century the Second World War took place in.
