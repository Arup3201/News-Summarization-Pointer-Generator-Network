A two year-old boy raised mainly by goats has been taken into care by social workers in Russia.

The malnourished wild child named Sasha T was kept in a room with the animals by his mother Marina, 40, in Rostov region and has not learned how to speak, eat or use a potty.

'He played and slept together with goats, which lived in the same room,' said life.ru news website.

'When we came in, Sasha's mother was absent,' said Irina Bochkova, deputy head of social work in the town of Shakhti.

'He was sitting in the ice cold room, undressed. Every hour could have become his last.

'It was incredibly cold, dirty and smelly in that house. We just grabbed him and rushed him to the city hospital.

'Doctors said that because of how lived, his brain has not developed properly.'

The 'Mowgli' boy weighs a third less than a typical child of his age.

Children's doctor Natalya Simonina said: 'He refused to sleep in the cot. He tried to get underneath and sleep there. He was very scared of adults.

'He tried to break everything he saw - windows, furniture.

'He could not speak or hold a spoon. He had no idea about what to do with toys, and didn't even try to play with them.'

Moves have begun to deprive the mother of her maternal rights, making Sasha an orphan.

Sasha is not the first case of a child being raised by animals.

In 2009, a five-year-old girl was found in a flat in the Siberian city of Chita, dressed in filthy clothes, barking at people.

Known only as ‘Natasha’, she had been shut up in a flat for five years with only cats and dogs for company and she could not even speak her native language.

Andrei Tolstyk was discovered in 2004, aged seven, after being abandoned by his parents when he was only three months old.

His family's guard dog looked after him as if he was a puppy.

But as a consequence he walked on all fours like a canine, sniffed at food and was known to bite people.
