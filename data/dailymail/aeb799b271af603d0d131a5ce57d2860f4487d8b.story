A senior Chinese tax officer and his wife hired a gang of thugs to wreck a supermarket when the owner refused to pay an over-inflated revenue demand.

Chen Zhiping, 42, and his wife Chen Aifang, 37 are facing a probe by anti-fraud investigators who believe he misappropriated cash to fund a luxury lifestyle.

Zhiping sent a demand to the supermarket in Shenmu county in West China's Shaanxi province when the owner refused to pay the demand.

The attackers threw buckets containing faeces and ink to destroy the store's stock and to make it more difficult to reopen the shop

The tax official and his wife are accused of visiting the store with a gang of hired thugs and began smashing property as well as throwing buckets filled with faeces over the shop's products.

Zhiping and his wife own several flats and have a fleet of luxury cars which would ordinarily be beyond the means of a couple living on a civil servant's salary.

The couple are also facing a compensation claim from the shop.

Supermarket owner Yi Ze, 49, said: 'We could not even wash away all the mess because they had put ink in the buckets as well so that everything was stained and ruined.'

Anti-fraud investigators have launched a probe into Zhiping's finances after questions were raised about how he can support a luxury lifestyle on his civil servant's salary

The store's owner Yi Ze, 49, said it was impossible for his staff to wash the store claiming that most of his stock had been ruined

Zhiping and his wife are believed to have made several other investments which he could not possibly afford on a civil servant's salary
