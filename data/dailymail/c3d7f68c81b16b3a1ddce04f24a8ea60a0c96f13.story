A family of drug dealers and their associates who peddled heroin and crack cocaine on the streets of Liverpool have been jailed for a total of 82 years.

Thirteen people involved in running a 24-hour drugs cash and carry service have been jailed after a complex police operation.

Police put the family under surveillance and deployed undercover officers before eventually swooping on the Whitney family clan and their cohorts.

Jailed: Lisa Whitney, 31

Custody: Carol Whitney, 54

Jailed: Ringleader Paul Whitney, 32, was given nine years and four months behind bars while and Matthew Mayor, 37, hurled £47,000 worth of drugs out of a car window as he tried to escape police

As the net closed on the drug dealers, officers found an SA80 assault rifle which had been stolen from army barracks on Salisbury Plain in 2005 and around 1,200 rounds of ammunition as well as a large quantity of Class A substances.

Undercover officers from Merseyside Police posed as addicts to make 'test purchases' to gain the 
necessary evidence as undercover officers filmed the footage.

The Whitneys used unregistered, 
pre-paid mobile telephones and deployed untraceable vehicles to 
rendezvous with addicts, often in a telephone kiosk on a street corner.

One undercover officer, known as Ray,
obtained a mobile number from a female addict which soon became known 
as the 'Whitney line'.

Ringleader Paul Whitney, his accomplices 
Michael O'Toole and Matthew Mayor, together with other family members 
Leslie Whitney, 57 and now estranged wife Carol Whitney, 54, were 
prominent players in the conspiracy that plagued the streets of Anfield,
Tuebrook and West Derby between 2009 and this year, Liverpool Crown Court heard.

Custody: Mary McCabe

Prison: Thomas Dowd

Behind bars: Gary Edwards

Ringleader Paul Whitney, 32, was given nine years and four months behind bars.

Matthew Mayor, 37, who threw £47,000 of drugs out of a car window, was given eight years and four months.

Banker and matriarch Carol Whitney, 53, was sentenced to eight years. Mary McCabe, 53, was given the same term.

Michael O'Toole, 33, was jailed for eight years and Leslie Whitney, 57, was given seven-and-a-half years.

Michael Waters, 25, was told he must serve five years and four months in prison and Neil Brady, 35, received five years and four months.

Wayne Hincks, 28, received six years and eight months in prison.

Lisa Whitney, 31, and Gary Edwards, 48, were given four years. Thomas Dowd, 29, was ordered to serve four years and four months.

Emma Mackenzie, 29, was also jailed for two years and three months.

In a desperate attempt to escape police, clan member Matthew Mayor, 37, hurled one kilo packets of cocaine out the window of his Mercedes S320 as he was chased down by surveillance teams in December last year.

The packets split as they hit the road - showering the carriageway with £47,000 worth of drugs.

After weaving in and out of rush-hour traffic and crossing the central reservation he was eventually cornered and arrested.

Mother Emma Mackenzie, 29, tried to hide
cocaine wraps in the nappy bag of her young child, then aged under 12 
months, as she passed the toddler to her own mum, Mary McCabe, during a 
police raid on her home in Anfield.

When police arrested grandmother Carol Whitney, who was the matriarch and banker, officers found more than 500 wraps of heroin hanging from a bush in her garden.

Judge John Roberts, sitting at Liverpool Crown Court, jailed them all for their role in the conspiracy.

Detective Chief Superintendent Tony Doherty from the Merseyside Police Matrix team said the family - who were on incapacity benefits - were making a lot of money out of their drug deals.

'We took out for example 12 kilo of heroin which was plum cut. This has made heroin certainly more scarce in that area,' he said.

'There were seven actual members of the Whitney family involved and there were their associates as well.

'It's not an unusual situation and the family were doing very well. The matriarch in it was on £5,000-a-year benefits but she was able to take large mortgages out and about £114,000 had gone through her account in just 12 months so it was very profitable for them.

He added: 'We watched this family and there were people calling all hours of the day and nice cars outside the house. Bear in mind all they had was invalidity benefit.

'If you see people who aren't working who have nice cars who have houses that they can't possible afford then let us know who they are.

'We will have a look at them and if they are the same as this family we will do the same to them, we will put them where they belong.'

Sinister: The rifle is standard-issue for soldiers in the British Army

Ammunition: Police discovered 1,200 rounds of ammunition as they carried out raids at addresses across Liverpool

Haul: Discarded bags of drugs which were dumped as police raided properties belonging to the Whitney clan and their associates
