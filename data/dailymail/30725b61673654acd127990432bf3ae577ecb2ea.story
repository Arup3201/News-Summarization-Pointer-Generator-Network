A college water polo star was one of the 13 injured in virgin-killer Elliot Rodger's Friday rampage on the University of California Santa Barbara campus.

Alamo, California native Nick Pasichuke was in Isla Vista visiting his best friend Tyler Martin when he unfortunately came into Rodger's path.

The University of the Pacific freshman was skateboarding back from a burrito run with Martin's roommate Patrick Eggert and two other girls around 9:30pm when Rodger's car came up from behind at top speed.

'It's a blur,' Pasichuke told the San Francisco Gate. 'My friend (Eggert) was on his bicycle and I had my longboard , and then I was hit out of nowhere. Next thing I knew I was lying in the street. It threw me 50 feet down the road.'

The collision happened right outside Martin's home, and he came running out to help Pasichuke. The two attended San Ramon Valley High School together where they were both on the water polo team.

'As I was leaning over and trying to comfort him - he said he was in a lot of pain, obviously - I heard pop, pop, pop,' Martin told NBC Bay Area.

It reportedly took ambulances 45 minutes to show up because of the other victims.

Pasichuke broke both of his legs and sustained facial fractures and scarring on much of his body from the impact. Eggert was also injured, but was able to walk after the accident.

Pasichuke underwent surgery Saturday and was in good condition recovering at Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital on Monday.

Luckily, Pasichuke will be able to play water polo again. He currently plays attacker for his Stockton, California college team and planned to spend the summer working as a lifeguard and training.

'Nick's an athlete, so he's got a strong upper body; I think that helped him come through it,' his mother Jill Pasichuke told the Gate. 'I'm just happy I have a kid to take home.'

Back home in Alamo, Nick's 17-year-old sister Katie says there's been an outpouring of support.

'There has been a lot of support from the community, people calling, stopping by and also on social media, and we're thankful for that,' Katie Pasichuke said. 'My brother was very lucky to have been one of the survivors.'

Support for Pasichuke is also evident on Twitter, where friends have been wishing him well with the hashtag #PrayForCheeks.

His attacker Rodgers died Saturday night from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound.

Rodgers set out that evening to kill as many girls as possible, blaming his virginity at the age of 22 on all womankind.

Six were killed in the rampage, and 13 injured.

On Monday, three of the injured remained in the hospital. Pasichuke was one of two in good injury, while the other was listed as fair.

Improving: Pasichuke was listed as being in good condition at the hospital on Monday
