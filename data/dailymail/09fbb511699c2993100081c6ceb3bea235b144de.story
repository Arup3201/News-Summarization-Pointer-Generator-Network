A husband and wife who were born on the same day and celebrated their 75th wedding anniversary last year have died just a day apart.

The couple's son Les Brown Jr said that 94-year-old Helen Brown died on July 16 and 94-year-old Les Brown died on July 17 in southern California.

Mrs Brown had stomach cancer while Mr Brown had battled Parkinson's disease.

Lifetime of love: Helen and Les Brown whose marriage lasted for 75 years died just a day apart in southern California

The Browns were born on New Year's Eve in 1918. They met in high school and became teenage sweethearts before eloping in 1937 at the age 18.

The couple eloped because their parents thought the marriage between a wealthy man and a working-class woman would never last.

Last September they celebrated their 75th anniversary. Their eldest son Les Jr told the Long Beach Press-Telegram: 'It was a real love match, wasn't it. They were together every day for 75 years.'

Their youngest son Daniel also told the newspaper: 'My mom often said she didn't want to see my father die, and he didn't want to live without her.'

The couple moved to Long Beach in 1963. Mr Brown pursued a career as a photographer while Mrs Brown sold real estate.

There will be a joint memorial service for the soul-mates on Saturday.
