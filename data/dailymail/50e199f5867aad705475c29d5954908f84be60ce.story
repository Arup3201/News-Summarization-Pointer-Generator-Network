Mexican media are mourning with the rest of their nation after their World Cup dream was ended in dramatic fashion, while the Dutch can't help but celebrate making the last eight.

Two late goals from the Netherlands saw them through to the quarter-final at the expense of Mexico, with a 93rd-minute penalty from Klaas-Jan Huntelaar sealing the 2-1 defeat.

Manager Miguel Herrera, the worst paid at the World Cup on Â£125,000-a-year, got within five minutes of qualifying for the next round, but escaping the last 16 proved a step too far.
