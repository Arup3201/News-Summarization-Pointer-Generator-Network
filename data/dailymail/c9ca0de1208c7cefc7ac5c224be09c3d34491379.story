Two baby bear cubs became stuck in a tree in Wisconsin on Saturday and after hearing their desperate cries, a local cabin owner sought help.

Officials speculate that bear cubs near Milltown, Wisconsin got caught in a tree trunk after falling debris blocked their exit and left them trapped inside with just their snouts sticking out of the trees.

A local cabin owner called the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (DNR) after the sounds of animals screaming led her to the bear cubs.

Stuck: The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources says two cubs climbed into a tree and debris fell down, sealing the hole off so they couldn't get out, near Milltown, Wisconsin

'In 15 years of being a warden I haven't seen bears caught in a tree before. I've seen lots of bears just none that were trapped like that,' warden Jesse Ashton said.

Both Ashton and the Milltown Fire Department were able to cut a window into the tree and free the cubs, reports NBC.

'We cut a hole in the tree and then we all backed off and waited,' Warden Phil Dorn said in a report released Thursday by DNR.

Both of the cubs were unharmed and after being freed from the tree's bark, scampered off back into the wood in good health with just a few pieces of wood scattered atop their furry heads, reports ABC.
