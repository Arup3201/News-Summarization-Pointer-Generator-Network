Revealed: Peter Mandelson's consultancy firm made more than £500,000 in its first year

The consulting firm set up by former Cabinet Minister Lord Mandelson made more than half a million pounds in its first year.

Accounts published by Global Counsel LLP provide a fresh insight into the financial affairs of the Labour peer, which have long been shrouded in mystery.

The documents show that the company, which has an office in Knightsbridge, one of London’s most expensive districts, accumulated net assets of £560,000 between November 2010 and December 2011.

As well as his income from the business, Lord Mandelson, right, is thought to receive up to £1 million a year as a senior adviser to investment bank Lazards.

He also receives a large income from speaking engagements and sales of his memoirs.

Little
is known of Global Counsel’s activities but in May it was revealed that
the firm had been recruited to advise Asia Pulp and Paper (APP), a 
multinational company accused by Greenpeace of illegally chopping down rainforests in Indonesia.

APP has denied acting irresponsibly.

Lord
Mandelson has used his array of business and political contacts 
gathered during four years as a European Commissioner and twoyears as Business Secretary under Gordon Brown to help build the international profile of his company.

It was formed just six months after 
Labour’s 2010 Election defeat and has been able to operate in secrecy 
until now, but under new House of Lords rules, the former Hartlepool MP 
will have to publish a list of clients from next March.

Lord Mandelson’s earnings since leaving office two years ago – and the purchase of his current home, a £7.6 million property in London – have been the subject of much speculation.

He has acquired a fortune few ex-politicians can aspire to, with the exception of his former boss, Tony Blair. Global Counsel and Lord Mandelson declined to comment last night.
