The most expensive beach hut in Britain has sold for a staggering £170,000 in just two days of going on the market.

The wooden structure on an isolated spit has no running hot water or washing facilities and requires a 30 minute walk, a ride on a land-train or a short ferry trip to get there.

Yet estate agents were overcome with interest in the 18ft by 10ft timber retreat and a bidding frenzy meant the hut was able to command the record price.

Sold: This is Britain's most expensive beach hut which has sold for £170,000 in just two days in bidding frenzy

The immaculately-decorated hut on Mudeford Spit near Christchurch, Dorset, boasts stunning dual views of the harbour on one side and The Solent on the other.

The surge in beach hut sales is at odds with the national housing market that is struggling in the financial climate.

The Mudeford sandbank is recognised has having the most expensive huts in the country, although the previous highest price paid for one was £126,000 three months ago.

Comfortable: The galley kitchen in the wooden hut even has a stove, fridge and a sink with running water

Bedtime: The hut sleeps six but a bylaw dictates people can only stay overnight between March and October

Relaxing: The hut also has solar panels on the roof to provide electricity for lighting

The £170,000 sum could buy an 'exceptional detached villa' with three bedrooms near Glasgow.

It could also buy a Grade II listed cottage in the historic market town of Wymondham in Norfolk or a luxury three bedroom detached house in Hull.

Hut 97 at Mudeford has solar panels on the roof to provide electricity for lighting and a 12V pump system that supplies water from a tap.

It has a fitted kitchen with gas oven and fridge which can be powered by a battery or gas.

Views: Sunbathers can see The Solent and the Habour (which would be more stunning without rain clouds)

Big business: There are 350 beach huts at Mudeford (pictured) which normally sell for about £140,000 each

There is a separate bedroom on the 
ground floor two single beds in the cramped confines of the roof eaves 
plus a sofa bed in the living space.

Although six people can sleep there, a local bylaw only allows overnight stays from March through to October.

On top of the asking price, the new owners will have to pay a ground rent to the local council of £2,500 a year.

It has been bought by a wealthy family with grown-up children from Christchurch.

Storage: There's space in the ground floor of the hut to store beach equipment such as sun loungers and boats

Luxury: A wealthy family from Christchurch have bought the beach hut - one of 350 in the local area

Andrew Denison, from Denisons Estate Agents in Christchurch, said: 'The hut is positioned side-on with views of the harbour and the sea and the Isle of Wight, making it quite rare.

'The dual aspect views and the fact it is such a good size meant that as soon as we put it on the website people found it appealing.

'There was a frenzy of people interested and appointments were booked very quickly.

'The most expensive hut we have sold before went for £126,000 last month and we usually put them on the market for about £140,000.

'But, this hut is plush and a fantastic size so I think that is why it went so fast and for so much, I don’t know of any that have sold for this sort of figure.

'It must be one of the most expensive beach huts in Britain, I haven’t seen any go for more money than this.'

There are about 350 beach huts at Mudeford that make up the 23,000 huts in Britain.
