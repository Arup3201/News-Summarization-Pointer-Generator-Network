PR Queen Roxy Jacenko's two-year-old daughter Pixie Rose Curtis has hit headlines worldwide for her jetsetting, lavish lifestyle and her Instagram account, which captures every fabulous moment.

At a time when most two-year-olds would be watching Peppa Pig, Pixie is busy with her 28 thousand Instagram followers on her @pixiecurtis account, as well as her entrepreneurial ventures with her own line of hair bows.

The Mirror UK and popular US news and entertainment site, BuzzFeed have both become aware of the Sydneysider's online antics and crowned the toddler 'the Princess of Instagram'.

BuzzFeed introduced US readers to the outgoing tot by saying 'Sorry Kendall and Kylie (Jenner, the younger sisters of Kim Kardashian), this two-year-old owns Instagram.'

The tot has a stylish lifestyle and impressive wardrobe, but little Pixie earns her keep.

Pixie's account is a revenue stream for Roxy's Ministry Of Talent business, with brands charged $200 a post to plug their wares.

Pixie also has her line of hair bows for children, Pixie's Bows, which her blog and Instagram account work to promote.

Business-savvy Jacenko, the owner of PR agency Sweaty Betty, says she is using the income to create a trust fund for her daughter. Ms Jacenko, 33, reasons that Pixie will have her own empire by the time she grows up 'all on her own merit.'

'Pixie has an account which I opened a week after she was born and anything that she earns goes into that account so when she's older, she has a good start,' the 34-year-old previously told the MailOnline.

'I'm going to teach her to be smart with her money, as my parents did with me, work hard, earn it but don’t blow it on materialistic things until you have property.

'It's like driving a Ferrari but renting where you live – I am of the breed you buy where you have to live and in turn be extravagant with token items.'

'Commercial opportunities-wise, I am a business person, you don’t say never – you take each and every opportunity as it comes,' the 33-year-old added.

'I guess it’s the entrepreneur in me. If I can help the kids get a head start – fantastic!'

In a move that Jacenko described as 'ludicrous', the popular Instagram account was temporarily removed in June this year.

The mother-of-two was outraged when her daughter's account was deleted, with Instagram claiming it violated the photo-sharing app's age restrictions.

Pixie Curtis makes around $200 for her sponsored posts on Instagram, where the sassy toddler and her PR expert mother, Ms Jacenko post photos to spruik products. She also uses the social media image-sharing site to promote her own accessory line, 'Pixie's Bows.' The photo above was shared on Instagram to offer her followers an exclusive discount for her hair bows.

Here comes the Prince! Pixie Curtis' three-month-old baby brother, Hunter Curtis (pictured middle) has more than 3000 followers on his Instagram account, but is yet to post a photo - which is quite understandable...

But after writing to Instagram headquarters explaining the account is not run by a two-year-old but in fact her social media savvy mother the account was re-activated.

'It's all a bit silly really, a harmless account run by a 33-year-old mother to share funny content – it's hardly breaking any laws,' Ms Jacenko said.

Roxy and her troubled investment banker husband Oliver Curtis welcomed Hunter into the world in May.

Hunter has more than three thousand followers on Instagram, but the three-month old is yet to post a photo.

'When the time is right I will start doing some posts of his journey with his sister ... to share the images with friends and family,' she explained.

The children's finance professional father faces possible jail time over insider trading allegations.

Earlier this year, Curtis entered a plea of not guilty at an arraignment hearing on charges he traded illegally to make a $1 million profit. He is currently on bail.

Look out world! The adorable little girl poses in front of her family's Louis Vuitton luggage, sending a message of peace to the close to 30 thousand people that follow to see her daily posts.
