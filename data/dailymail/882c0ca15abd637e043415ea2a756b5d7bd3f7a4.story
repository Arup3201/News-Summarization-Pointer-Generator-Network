Veteran newsreader Sir Alastair Burnet has died aged 84 after suffering several strokes, his family announced today.

The presenter, familiar to households all over the country as the anchor of News at Ten, fronted coverage of the wedding of Prince Charles to Lady Diana Spencer in 1981 and the 1969 Apollo 11 moon landings.

He captured the momentous NASA expedition for viewers by saying: There it is, the old Moon - the one the cow jumped over, the one the poets wrote about, the one that lovers made love to. And from now on, it’s going to be rather a different one.'

He also enjoyed a distinguished print career as the editor of The Economist and the Daily Express.

In a statement, his family said: 'He passed away peacefully in the middle of the night at the Beatrice Place Nursing Home in Kensington, where he was being cared for after suffering several strokes.'

Today, journalists paid tribute to their late colleague.

Broadcaster
Andrew Neil said: 'Alastair was one of the greatest journalists of his 
generation, as much at home in print as TV news and current affairs, 
where he was a legendary figure as Britain’s premier newscaster and 
anchorman.

Broadcaster Andrew Neil paid tribute to a man who possessed: 'gentlemanly kindness'

'He played a pivotal role in the rise of ITN as Political Editor, interviewer and newscaster; he launched ITN’s News At Ten, Britain’s first dual-anchored, half-hour newscast - the most successful newscast in British broadcast history; and he will always be remembered for presenting historic live events, from numerous election nights - on BBC and ITV - to US space launches to major royal events.

'He will also always be recalled by family, friends and colleagues for his unparalleled professionalism, humour and gentlemanly kindness, especially to journalists starting out on their careers.

'Joy it was to be in his company and he was an inspiration to many who followed in his footsteps - the broadcasters’ broadcaster.'

BBC newsreader Huw Edwards added his voice to the tributes.

He said: 'He was one of the true greats of British television news. Alastair Burnet was an inspiration to many of those who are prominent in broadcast journalism today.

'Viewers liked and respected his authority and experience, and his understated style. He represented the best traditions of ITN and his period at the helm of News at Ten was without doubt the best in the programme's distinguished history.'

Helen Boaden, director of BBC News, 
said: 'ITN has lost a hugely dedicated colleague whose energy and drive 
were unique. His passion for the story always shone through and 
television journalism is the poorer without him.'

Born
in Sheffield, Sir Alastair studied at Oxford University before 
embarking on a career which saw him work on the BBC's Panorama programme
as well as the ITV work he was best-known for, fronting general 
election coverage throughout the 1970s and 1980s.

He was well-known for presenting documentaries about the Royal Family, particularly Prince Charles and Diana, Princess of Wales.

His
royal coverage led to him being lampooned in satirical puppet show 
Spitting Image and magazine Private Eye as a gushing royalist.

Sir
Alastair led the coverage of the 1969 moon landings, remembered for 
saying: 'There it is, the old Moon - the one the cow jumped over, the 
one the poets wrote about, the one that lovers made love to. And from 
now on, it’s going to be rather a different one.'

Coincidentally, Sir Alastair's Spitting Image character famously featured in a sketch which made light of the deaths of leading figures from the entertainment world, and the flood of praise which followed.

The puppet joked: 'Tonight's main headline - someone famous has died.'The world of entertainment is in mourning at the death of a fellow professional, who they didn't have a good word for while they were alive.'

John Hardie, chief executive of ITN, said Sir Alastair's standard of work might never be equalled.

'ITN stands on the shoulders of giants, none greater than Sir Alastair Burnet. He defined newscasting for a generation and his influence is still clearly evident today,' he said.

'He set the bar to a standard that has never been surpassed and perhaps not even equalled. Sir Alastair will be sorely missed by many here at ITN, but his legacy lives on.'

The Burnet family will hold a private funeral with a public memorial service to be organised for a later date.
