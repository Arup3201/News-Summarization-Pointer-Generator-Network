Gangsters who planted a hand grenade in the bushes outside Kenny Dalglish's home were jailed for life today, ending a merciless campaign of violence across the north of England.

The gang of five, led by Kirk Bradley and Anthony 'Fat Tony' Downes, both 26, was responsible for numerous shootings across Liverpool, a kidnapping in which they shot their victim and dumped him in woods and a string of bungled assassination attempts.

But their weapon of choice was more often the hand grenade whether they were carrying out their own violent vendettas against rival crooks, or doing the dirty work for unscrupulous kingpins within Liverpool's criminal underworld.

Downes and Bradley were convicted in absentia having gone on the run following a daring prison van escape before their trial.

Downes, who was described in court as the gang's 'chief executive' and known in criminal circles as 'Fat Tony', was snared by police in the Netherlands on Friday and will be flown to the UK soon to begin serving his time.

But Bradley remains at large.

At Woolwich Crown Court, they were both jailed for life with a minimum of 22 years after being convicted in their absence of conspiracy to possess firearms with intent to endanger life and conspiracy to cause damage with intent to endanger life.

Thug: Craig Riley, 25, will serve a minimum of 14 years

Three others admitted possessing firearms and causing criminal damage with intent to endanger life and were jailed for life.

Gary Wilson, 27, of Southport was sentenced to a minimum of 16 years; Joseph Farrell, 23, of Brandearth Hey in Stockbridge Village, Knowsley, will serve a minimum of 12 years and Craig Riley, 25, of Boode Croft, also in Stockbridge Village, will serve a minimum of 14 years.

The gang carried out shootings and grenade attacks and operated on behalf of others in the Liverpool underworld.

The grenade was left on Mr Dalglish’s front wall in July 2009, when he was not Liverpool’s manager, but it was not intended for him.

Between 2009 and 2010 Bradley and Downes, who described themselves as blood brothers, ran their network but did not get their hands dirty with the numerous shootings and bombings they ordered.

Downes was serving a seven year jail stretch for multiple attacks on cash machines but was the 'chief executive controlling and organising events from his prison cell,' said the judge Mr Justice Henriques.

The gang carried out shootings and grenade attacks and operated on behalf of others in the Liverpool underworld.

The grenade was left on Mr Dalglish’s front wall in July 2009, when he was not the five-time European cup winner’s manager, and it was not intended for him.

It was believed to be intended for wealthy businessman John Ball who was also the target of two shootings and a neighbour of Mr Dalglish.

Mr Ball hired a security guard to keep watch on his home in Selworthy Road, Southport, following attacks in March and June 2009.

Close call: The grenade was left on Mr Dalglish’s front wall in July 2009, when he was not the five-time European cup winner’s manager, and it was not intended for him

The grenade was left on the wall by one of two men who ran off when police arrived - but another was arrested.

Between 2009 and 2010 Bradley and Downes, who described themselves as blood brothers, ran their network but did not get their hands dirty with the numerous shootings and bombings they ordered.

Downes was serving a seven year jail stretch for multiple attacks on cash machines but was the 'chief executive controlling and organising events from his prison cell,' said the judge Mr Justice Henriques.

When he was arrested last week in Goes, Zeeland, he was checking into holiday accommodation but was caught with a loaded .44 Magnum revolver and two fake passports.

Menace: An Uzi sub machine gun and silencer left by the gang following a shooting

The judge said of Bradley, who was convicted of robbery aged 15: 'Bradley is plainly a very dangerous man.

'There is a serious risk to members of the public of serious harm being occasioned by him of further specified offences.'

He added: 'Any right-thinking member of the public would feel abhorrence and outrage at this merciless campaign which Bradley oversaw and co-managed.'

Their other crimes involved shooting another man in a pub; spraying a victim's house with bullets, gunning down a man because he ejected gatecrashing troublemakers from a party as well as various grenade attacks.

Between June 2008 and March 2010 there were only seven hand grenade explosions in the UK - but five were in Merseyside.

One of those was launched into the home of a man targeted by the gang.

He was asleep upstairs with his partner and two children when the gang struck - he later told police the bomb 'blew the place to bits'.

'It was remarkable no one was injured,' said Mr Justice Henriques.

The judge described Wilson as Downes’s 'right hand man, furnishing him with information and receiving instructions from him'.

There were more than 1,000 phone calls between them, investigators found.

'You were a most important cog in the workings of this conspiracy,' the judge told him.

Dangerous: A Browning revolver left in a cab by the gang following a raid

Co-accused Riley, who has previously served four years for possessing Class A drugs with intent to supply, was a 'highly significant' gang member who played a part in several attacks and was responsible for moving around an Uzi machine pistol the thugs owned.

Farrell admitted providing a firearm for the shooting of two men and providing another gun used to spray a house with bullets.

Referring to the tragic murder of schoolboy Rhys Jones in 2007 who was caught in the crossfire of a Liverpool gang war, Mr Justice Henriques said: 'Merseyside has learned the hard way when it comes to stray bullets.'
