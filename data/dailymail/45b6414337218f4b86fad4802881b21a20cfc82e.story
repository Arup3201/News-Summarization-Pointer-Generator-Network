Despite the unsavoury snobbery that still existed when he rose to become a Tory minister in 1979, Leon Brittan, whose parents were Lithuanian Jews, exemplified the meritocratic nature of Thatcherism.

Brittan’s father had arrived in this country in 1927 without much money, to work as a doctor in North London. Leon won a scholarship to Haberdashers’ Aske’s School (his brother Sir Samuel, a distinguished economics commentator, attended Kilburn Grammar), and went on to the richest and grandest of all the Cambridge colleges, Trinity, to read law, before securing a postgraduate fellowship at Yale.

He immersed himself in politics, becoming president of the Cambridge Union and chairman of the University Conservative Association.

True blue: Leon Brittan rose through the ranks of government under Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher

His was a gilded generation of student politicians such as Norman Fowler, Ken Clarke, Michael Howard, John Gummer and Norman Lamont, who went on to be part of the government together. But as one of them put it to me, they all regarded Brittan as ‘very exceptionally able’.

Called to the Bar, he devoted his spare time to politics, becoming chairman of the Bow Group — a nursery for ambitious ex-Oxbridge politicians — and fought the unwinnable Labour seat of North Kensington at the 1966 and 1970 elections.

In 1974, after 15 rejections elsewhere, he found a safe seat and remained an MP until 1988.

His first government job was as a Home Office minister and he then joined the Cabinet as Chief Secretary to the Treasury, responsible for implementing the severe spending cuts that marked the first term of the Thatcher government.

He won great respect for the way in which he not only mastered a very complicated brief, but for the calm way in which he implemented some intensely controversial spending restraints.

It was probably the most distinguished passage in his political career, though a decade later he would be praised for the efficiency and competence with which he completed the European Single Market.

Cabinet: After the 1983 election, still aged just 43, Brittan (seated, fourth from right) became the youngest Home Secretary since Winston Churchill in 1910

However, he was not universally liked, his occasionally shy manner coming across as arrogance or a sense of superiority, leading fellow Tory Alan Clark to describe him as ‘oily, loathsome’ and ‘without a political principle’.

He married late — at the age of 41 — shortly after entering government — to Diana Clemetson. The couple were happy for 35 years, and Brittan became a devoted stepfather to his wife’s daughters from a previous marriage.

After the 1983 election, still aged just 43, he became the youngest Home Secretary since Winston Churchill in 1910. His ultimate responsibility for the controversial policing of the miners’ strike was a severe test of his presentational skills that he did not entirely pass.

Crushing blow: Brittan, pictured in 2013, resigned after Mrs Thatcher admitted his part in the leaking of the letter which criticised Michael Heseltine

Also, at a time of IRA outrages, he also became unpopular with the Tory Right over his ambivalence on the death penalty.

He was moved after two years to Trade and Industry — mainly because Mrs Thatcher considered him a poor communicator, but also because she was dissatisfied by the progress Brittan had made in persuading the BBC not to give the ‘oxygen of publicity’ to IRA terrorists.

Within months he was embroiled in the ferocious Cabinet debate over Westland, a British helicopter company. Brittan was admirably loyal to Mrs Thatcher, and imagined he was doing her bidding when he authorised the leaking of a letter from the Solicitor-General that criticised his Cabinet colleague Michael Heseltine, the Defence Secretary.

Heseltine was trying to put together a European consortium to buy Westland, while Mrs Thatcher backed a rescue by Sikorsky, an American firm. Furious that no one would listen to him, Heseltine resigned and stormed out of a Cabinet meeting.

It was later disclosed that Brittan had done more to destabilise the European deal than just authorise the leak. He sought to persuade two British firms in the consortium, British Aerospace and GEC, to leave and, effectively, cripple it.

When Mrs Thatcher was forced to admit his part in the leak, Brittan resigned, having been cut adrift by Tory MPs outraged that he had put her in such a vulnerable position — but for a typically blundering performance by Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, she might have been forced from office. She tried to persuade Brittan not to go, but he knew he had no other support.

It was a crushing blow for an ambitious man, still only 46 and with, as he saw it, more glittering prizes ahead of him.

In due course, Mrs Thatcher offered him a consolation prize — one of Britain’s two European Commissioners’ jobs.

I had a rare insight into his thinking over the appointment — having coincidentally arranged to have lunch with him on the day in 1988 he had been told.

He confided that he had serious doubts about taking the job, believing he had a future, instead, at Westminster as a Cabinet minister.

Pro-Europe: Serving the European Commission for ten years, Brittan was responsible for advancing the career of Nick Clegg, who, in 1994, became one of his advisers.

Also — and it is strange to recall this now considering how fervent a European he subsequently became — he expressed profound Euroscepticism, saying he found the way the European Commission did business unattractive and contrary to British interests.

It wasn’t long before he ‘went native’ — one of the most fervent imaginable apologists for the European Union, and a strong advocate of closer European integration.

Serving the Commission for ten years, he was responsible for advancing the career of Nick Clegg, who, in 1994, became one of his advisers.

As his last years were clouded by sordid allegations, his loyal circle of friends — many of them from Cambridge days — regarded him with admiration and affection.

They believed the lurid claims were simply a smear, and that this elder statesman deserved better.

Whatever the truth, one thing is beyond doubt. But for one foolish misjudgment over the Westland leak, Leon Brittan’s career might have been radically different, and he would have died a far more considerable figure in our politics than he was fated to be.
