Fearless villagers in South Africa have been filmed wrestling with deadly Nile crocodiles in a bid to catch as many as possible after 15,000 escaped from a farm.

The reptiles, which can grow to 16ft long, were accidentally freed after heavy rain made the nearby Limpopo river flood last weekend.

Bosses at the Rakwena Crocodile Farm in the north-east of  the country opened the gates to the animals’ pens to release the rising waters – inadvertently letting their entire stock out.

Caught: At least 2,000 of the crocodiles are believed to have been recaptured since they escaped last weekend

Danger: Nile crocodiles are meat eaters and have been known to attack humans

The reptiles have since been spotted 
all over the local area – including on a school sports field – and 
wildlife experts urged local people to avoid the animals and stay 
indoors.

As the flood waters fell, many have been found trapped in the branches of trees.

The Nile crocodile is the largest crocodile in Africa and the second-largest in the world after the saltwater crocodile.

Prey consists of gazelles, antelope, waterbuck, sitatunga, lechwe, wildebeest, zebras, warthogs, giraffes and Cape buffalos.

They are also known to eat domestic animals such chickens, goats, sheep and cattle and are known to attack humans.

Males typically measure between 3.5 and 5 metres but very old, mature ones can grow to 5.5 m or more.

They are found in Somalia, Ethiopia, Uganda, Kenya, Egypt, Tanzania, Burundi, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Gabon, South Africa, Malawi, Sudan, South Sudan, Botswana, and Cameroon. Isolated populations also exist in Madagascar and in Senegal.

But as this incredible footage shows, many residents showed no fear in tackling the crocodiles themselves.

At least 2,000 had been caught by Friday according to South Africa's Afrikaans language Beeld newspaper.

Police have been leading the hunt which has mainly taken place at night because their eyes reflect in the torchlight and they are easier to find.

The video shows locals pinning the crocodiles to the ground and then handcuffing them with plastic ties.

Earlier this week, the crocodile farm's boss Zane Langman told the Beeld that he has been recapturing the animals whenever he is alerted to one.

He said he had already caught 'a few 
thousand' in the dense bush and orange groves next to his farm, but he 
told the newspaper that 'more than half' of his reptiles are still 
missing.

Commercial
 crocodile farms breed the animals for their skin, which is used to make
 crocodile leather for items such as belts, shoes and handbags.

There is also a small market for 
crocodile meat, but most often the dead reptile's is fed to other crocs 
as the species is cannibalistic.

The
 commercial crocodile farming industry is small, but growing, in South 
Africa, where there are around 60 farms containing a total of around 
500,000 animals.

Because the quality of the skin is 
paramount, some farms keep each crocodile in its own, battery-style pen 
so that its hide is not scratched or otherwise damaged by other animals.

However this has lead to allegations of animal cruelty and most farms keep the animals in communal pens.

Nile
 Crocodiles are meat eating and can grow to up to five metres long. They
 can run at up to eight miles an hour and swim at up to 22 mph.

They
 are extremely dangerous to humans. Their preferred method of killing is
 to grab an animal in their enormous jaws then drag it, alive, 
underwater to drown it.
