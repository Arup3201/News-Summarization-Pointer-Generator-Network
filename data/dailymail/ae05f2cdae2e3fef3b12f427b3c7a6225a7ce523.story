Her sister Beatrice usually represents the Royal set at the smartest restaurants, events and clubs but in her absence yesterday, Princess Eugenie held fort quite capably.

The energetic 24-year-old attended four events in just 12 hours yesterday, looking smart and chic 
in a summery white dress, which she teamed with strappy black sandals 
and a studded box clutch.

The young royal began the day at a royal garden party at Buckingham Palace alongside the Duchess of Cambridge, then dashed to an art gala in central London, followed by an intimate Justin Timberlake gig and then finished the night off at celebrity hotspot, Tonteria.

It's been a long day! Royal couple Princess Eugenie and boyfriend Jack Brooksbank left the intimate Justin Timberlake gig and headed off to party at Tonteria

The young Princess was joined by her 
54-year-old mother, Sarah Ferguson, Duchess of York, at the Art Antiques London Gala
 Evening in aid of Children In Crisis at Kensington Gardens.

Sarah was clearly looking forward to the 
event, as she tweeted on May 18 in anticipation: '4 weeks until Art 
Antiques London Gala in aid of @childrencrisis, a wonderful evening for a
cause close to my heart.'

While her daughter added this comment on the Children in Crisis website: 'The night promises to be one 
of intrigue and excitement, taking you on a journey back in time to 
remember your childhood. It will be a very unique, and fantastic event 
raising vital funds needed to support the work of Children in Crisis.'

The event, at £75 a ticket, was priced at the equivalent cost of sending a child to school for a year in Liberia.

Happy to be here! Princess Beatrice, who usually attends lots of charity and fashion events, decided to hand over the reigns to her younger sister last night

Good night? Later on, the boyfriend and girlfriend were seen leaving Tonteria in the early hours after a night dancing to Justin Timberlake

Prince Harry's ex-girlfriend Cressida Bonas was also at the event, and she and Eugenie, who appear to be very close, shared some tender hugs and private chats.

Princess Eugenie then left her mother behind to meet boyfriend Jack Brooksbank at an intimate Justin Timberlake gig.

The couple then partied on at celebrity haunt Tonteria in swanky Sloane Square, alongside singer Jessie J.

All white on the night! Eugenie looked a little tired, albeit in good spirits, as she left the celebrity hotspot

Leading her home: Eugenie's boyfriend guided her to a waiting taxi following the long day

In good spirits: The royal looked like she'd had a rather enjoyable evening as she made her way home

Good night? The fashionable royal grinned as she left Tonteria nightclub on Sloane Square celebrating an aftershow for Justin Timberlake, who left by a back door
