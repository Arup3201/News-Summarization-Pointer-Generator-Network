Two of Europe’s biggest games take place on Sunday, as the pre-eminent teams of England duel, before the grand two in Spain go head to head.

Liverpool host Manchester United at Anfield at 1.30pm, followed by Real Madrid visiting the Nou Camp to face Barcelona at 8pm.

United’s trip to Liverpool is a contest for Champions League qualification, while El Clasico will once again go a significant way to deciding the destination of La Liga.

Whatever the results, the four clubs remain historically the best in their countries. But how do they all measure up for scale, success, and spending?
