A bride who was kidnapped and forced to marry an older man eventually escaped captivity, and after finding true love after 35 years, decided to celebrate by permanently wearing her wedding dress, and has done so for the last ten years.

Xiang Junfeng, 47, from Jimo in the Shandong province of China, is otherwise known as 'sister wedding gowns' by locals because of her tendency to wear her wedding gowns all year round.

When she was 18, Mrs Junfeng was kidnapped from her hometown and sold to a remote village to be the wife of an elderly man, but after 15 years in captivity, she found the courage to run away.

Xiang Junfeng wears one of her four wedding gowns all year round, and has done for the last 10 years, regardless of whether she is at home or outside doing farm work

She was originally sold to a man in 
Linyi, in China's Shandong province, but she claims the man almost used 
her like a slave, forcing her to work in the fields.

She later escaped, running to a village in Liujiazhuang village in Jimo city in Shandong province were she was helped by a local woman.

This woman eventually introduced Mrs Junfeng to her brother, Zhu Zhengliang, who she married in 2004.

Before the big day she bought one dress, and later made three others, so she could rotate them and always be wearing one for each of the four seasons.

She said: 'I bought one and made the other three.'

Mrs Junfeng has four wedding dresses, one of which she bought and the rest of which she made, so she would have one for each season

Mrs Junfeng was kidnapped when she was 20 and made to marry an older man, later being made to work in the fields as a labourer for her 'abusive' husband, and claims she was treated more like a prisoner than a wife

After she met and married her husband, he helped rehabilitate her to everyday life.

She said: 'I had only ever known a violent and abusive man and I avoided men until I
 met my new partner who brought me truly out of my shell, and treated me
 so differently.

'I couldn’t believe it when he asked me to marry him.

'My
 wedding day was the happiest day of my life and I never wanted it to 
end, and that was when I decided I wanted to not only keep wearing my 
wedding dress, but actually bought four other wedding dresses as well.

'We
 felt comfortable with each other, so we have been together since then. I
 am very happy now, as my husband is very good to me.'

Mrs Junfeng claims the only thing that upsets her is that she can't officially register her new marriage because her details are lost from when she was kidnapped - but the police have pledged to help her with the situation

The only thing that upsets Xiang is that she can't register her marriage
 officially because she doesn't have the correct paperwork because of 
her first marriage.

However, the local police station said they are 
thinking of helping Xiang become registered.

She said that locals regarded her as strange because of her obsession 
with the wedding dresses especially when she is working in the fields 
but added: 'I don’t even have any other clothes.

But she said the main thing was that it didn’t disturb her husband, who knew that it made her happy

She said: 'I don’t care what 
people say about me. My wedding dresses are part of my life and I will 
continue to wear them regardless.'

While sometimes faced with strange looks because of her bizarre dress sense, she says she doesn't care as long as her husband doesn't mind, because it makes her happy
