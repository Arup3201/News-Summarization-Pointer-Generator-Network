Thousands of mourners including Belgium's King Albert today remembered the 28 victims of last week's bus crash in a Swiss tunnel during a memorial service.

Under a sparkling sky, soldiers took part in a solemn procession that carried 15 coffins into a 5,000-capacity hall in Lommel in north-east Belgium.

The brown casket contained the remains of a teacher, the 14 white ones held the bodies of children who were on the cusp of their teenage years.

Grief: Soldiers bore 15 coffins into a 5,000-capacity Soeverein Arena in Lommel, Belgium

Tragic: One brown coffin carried the remains of a teacher, alongside 14 white caskets each containing a 12-year-old

Respect: The 15 coffins were lined up at the front of the hall for the hour-long ritual. The dignitaries walked over to the grieving families to try to give them some measure of comfort

Heartbreak: Thousands of mourners watched the ceremony on a giant screen suspended from the roof

The students and the teacher were 
from one of two schools in northern Belgium that shared a bus for a 
traditional 'snow class' vacation in Switzerland.

They were returning from that holiday
on March 13 when tragedy struck. Their bus, carrying 52 people, slammed
into a tunnel wall. In addition to the dead, 24 children were injured.

The cause of the crash remains under investigation.

Remembrance: Thousands of mourners including Belgium's King Albert attended a memorial service in Lommel today for victims of last week's bus crash in a Swiss tunnel that killed 22 children and six adults

Quiet reflection: Mourners gather outside the Soeverein Arena during the service

During the service, Lommel Mayor Peter Vanvelthoven asked: 'Is there something worse than parents who lose what they love most?'

In the three-hour ceremony in the 
blackened arena, a bittersweet attempt by pupils to briefly lift spirits
with the up-tempo evergreen song about Cheerful Friends failed to break
a leaden atmosphere.

Fathers and mothers, brothers and 
sisters of the dead gave speeches reminiscing about their lost loved 
ones, including a daughter's favourite meal and a son's newly decorated 
bedroom.

Goodbyes: The husband and children of teacher Veerle Vanheukelom watch as her coffin is carried into a hearse after the memorial service

Tribute: The 15 victims from Lommel were from one of two schools in northern Belgium that shared a bus for a traditional 'snow class' holiday in Switzerland

Devastated: Children comfort each other as they attend the service outside the town's Soeverein Arena

'The snow classes were a true feast. 
Happy, smiling kids. Excellent weather, great snow,' ski monitor 
supervisor Marina Claes said of the days preceding the tragedy.She spoke of snow barbecues, surprise parties, and on the last day 'everyone got their much desired ski diploma'.

A separate service will be held tomorrow for the victims from the other school, in the town of Heverlee.

Six of the victims were Dutch 
nationals, and Belgium's King Albert II was joined at the service by 
Dutch Crown Prince Willem Alexander, Belgian Prime Minister Elio Di Rupo
and his Dutch counterpart, Mark Rutte.

The 15 coffins were lined up at the 
front of the hall for the hour-long ritual. The dignitaries walked over 
to the grieving families to try to give them some measure of comfort.

The 'snow class' is a rite of passage
from childhood to teenage years for countless Belgian children, and the
contrast between the happiness of the trip and the horror of the crash 
has moved virtually everyone in the nation of 11million.

At the service, families pinned red roses into the center of a giant heart of yellow roses as the famed Scala choir sang.

As Scala sang a soulful rendition of 
U2's With Or Without You, the coffins were carried outside into the 
bright sunlight and handed back to the care of families for funeral 
arrangements.

Three girls who were on the trip 
remain in Switzerland. They were badly injured, but have regained 
consciousness and are out of immediate danger.

The crash near the Alpine town of Sierre was one of the worst road disasters in Swiss history.
