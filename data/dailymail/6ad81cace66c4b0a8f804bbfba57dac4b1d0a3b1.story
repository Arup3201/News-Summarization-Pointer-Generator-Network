Kobe Bryant says he's driven to return to the NBA to see if he can continue to play at the highest level.

The LA Lakers guard was ruled out of for the rest of season in January after tearing a right rotator cuff in his shoulder against the New Orleans Pelicans.

The 36-year-old has subsequently had surgery to repair the injury but now faces a nine-month rehabilitation process for the second-time in two years, following suffering a torn Achilles against the Golden State Warriors in April 2013.

'I just did this! I just did this!' Bryant yells upon recalling be told by the doctor how long he will be out for in Kobe: The Interview, a new special that first aired on Monday on NBA TV. 'I just did nine months [of injury rehab]. And I gotta do it again.'

Reports have since speculated that the five-time NBA champion would retire with just one more year left remaining on his contract, something that the shooting guard denies.

'The process of it. I wanna see if I can. I don't know If I can but I want to find out,' he says when asked what focuses him to make an injury comeback.

'I'm going to do what all I do is, which is break everything down to it's smallest form and smallest detail. And then go after it, day by day - just one day at a time.'

Prior to his injury the 17-time All-Star was averaging 22.3 points in 35 games this season for a struggling Lakers team.

Third on the NBA's all-time scoring list, he played in only six games last term due to knee and Achilles tendon injuries as Los Angeles posted a 27-55 record.

Bryant, who will be 37 years old this summer, is the NBA's highest-paid player at £15million this season, and he is under contract for £16m next year.
