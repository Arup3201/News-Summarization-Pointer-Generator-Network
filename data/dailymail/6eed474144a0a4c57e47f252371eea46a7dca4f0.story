Supt Wasim Chaudhry said: ‘We are really looking to speak to this man who is seen to pick up the ladies shoes and also possibly the handbag, maybe in good faith.

‘That handbag is key to establishing the identity of the victim. We have also looked at missing reports and at the moment there are no matches, so we are reliant on people coming forward.

‘I know the community will be very distressed and I want to reassure them that we have a team of very experienced officers investigating the matter.

‘The gentleman has been seen on CCTV picking up the shoes and then walking away.

‘It may well be the person has put them to one side or taken them for handing them in.

‘They haven't come forward yet with those items.

‘Whilst the incident was on going those shoes have been collected. I can hope that this person has person has done so in good faith maybe thinking it was lost property, maybe handing them in to the police.

‘We haven't had it handed in yet. It's inevitable we will have family members and friends concerned that a loved one hasn't come home. I would urge anyone who is concerned to come forward.

‘At this stage we are still working to identify who this victim was in what is a really tragic case.’

A 40-year-old lorry driver has been arrested on suspicion of causing death by careless driving and bailed pending further inquiries until May.
