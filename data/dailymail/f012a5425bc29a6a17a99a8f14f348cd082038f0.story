They say there is no such thing as a free lunch but apparently that rule does not apply to breakfasts.

Thousands of people spent the morning queuing for free McMuffins at McDonald's restaurants across China as the fast food chain gave away more than a million meals.

But many bargain hunters did not want to be seen queuing for a free breakfast and shielded their faces from photographers behind newspapers and clothes as they stood in line.

Eager: One man was so keen to get a free breakfast that he went to McDonald's still wearing his pyjamas

Not everyone was ashamed to claim the free food.

One man was so desperate not to miss out that he did not even bother getting dressed.

He was pictured wearing his pyjamas in the queue at Sham Shui Po, Hong Kong.

Restaurants across the country saw huge queues as staff held signs aloft advertising 1,000 free McMuffins.

Although the offer proved remarkably popular, many in China accused McDonald's of orchestrating a publicity stunt to distract people from recent media attention on bad practice.

The McDonald's promotion came just days after Chinese state television aired its annual expose on corporate malpractice to mark World Consumer Rights Day.

But the American food giant said the timing of the offer was purely coincidental.

Popular: McDonald's gave away more than a million McMuffins across China on Monday

On Friday, one of the most widely watched television shows in China  '3.15' reported on companies that it says violated the trust of consumers. 

Last year McDonald's apologised after it was criticised by the news programme for its food safety.

However, this year the programme focussed on Volkswagen, which was criticised for alleged issues with the cars' direct shift gearbox. The company said it will address the concerns.

Apple was also criticised. Programme makers accused the company of not giving the same post-sales service as users in other markets.

Consumer analysts say criticism on the show can cause significant harm to a brand.

James Roy, senior analyst at China Market Research Group, said: 'The minute there are questions about your practices that appear in any way credible, that can be devastating to consumer trust and extremely difficult to get back.'

Offer: The promotion came days after Chinese state television aired its annual expose on corporate malpractice to mark World Consumer Rights Day but the fast food chain said the timing was a coincidence

Senior director of communications at McDonald's China said in an email to Reuters: 'We have been through it once and we 
know how it feels.'

Asked if the breakfast promotion was related to Consumer Day, she said: 'There is no connection.'

McDonald's launched National Breakfast Day on Monday where up to 1,000 McMuffins were given away in 5,000 restaurants across Asia, the Middle East and South Africa.

Thousands of users on Weibo, China's version of Twitter, posted pictures of people queuing for breakfast.
