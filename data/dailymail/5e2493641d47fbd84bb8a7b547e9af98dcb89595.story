Southampton manager Mauricio Pochettino has told the club they must boost his transfer budget to allow him to compete in the Premier League, as Tottenham prepare to lure him to White Hart Lane.

After taking Southampton to eighth place, their joint-highest finish in 24 years, Pochettino believes he has hit a glass ceiling with his squad, particularly if Adam Lallana and Luke Shaw are sold, as expected.

On his way? Saints skipper Adam Lallana is one of several players who could be leaving St Mary's

Southampton face Manchester United in the final game of the season today and Pochettino, who has a year left on his contract, said: ‘If you look at the last 10 years in the Premier League you will see it is always the same seven teams that finish in the top seven.

'We have come as far as we could. We have done everything we could and our position this season is eighth place.

‘The fact is we have been fighting against amazing top clubs such as Manchester City.

‘In order to try to reach their level we need to have a major international budget resourcing and try to match them on their own terms.’

Wanted: Luke Shaw is being courted by several clubs at the top of the Premier League

Pochettino believes he has fulfilled the  ‘five-year plan’ to establish Saints as a Premier League force.

He added: ‘(It was) established by Markus Liebherr and Nicola Cortese and the main goal was to promote Southampton to the Premier League.

‘That has been done and now we start a new project.’
