Every day Sportsmail takes a look at the European papers to see what are the biggest stories creating talking points on the continent.

In Italy, the papers are dominated by the Azzurri's 5-3 friendly win over Brazilian club giants Fluminense on Sunday.

The performance of Cesare Prandelli's side in their final World Cup warm-up match before Saturday's opener against England,  has left the Italian papers purring - especially over hat-trick hero Ciro Immobile.

Loud and proud: Gazeeta and Corriere both hail Italy strikers Ciro Immobile and Lorenzon Insigne

La Gazzetta dello Sport leads with a picture of the 24-year-old striker - who recently moved to Borussia Dortmund for £15.6million - and the headline: Ciro of Italy.

They are also full of praise for Immobile's strike partner Lorenzo Insigne, who scored twice in the rout.

They boldly declare that after such an impressive performance, Prandelli has options up front and that there is now more to Italy than Mario Balotelli.

It's not all good news, however, as La Gazzetta warn that the defence is still an area of concern for Prandelli.

Corriere dello Sport also hail the partnership between Immobile and Insigne. They also declare that Manchester City and Chelsea are interested in Napoli strike Jose Callejon - who played for Jose Mourinho at Real Madrid.

They also reflect on Italy's win over Fluminense and say Prandelli was pleased with the performance of Immobile and Insigne. Interestingly, they also reportat that Kaka is ready to say goodbye to AC Milan.

In Portugal, Diario Record splash on Benfica's pursuit of AC Milan midfielder Bryan Cristante who, they say, could be tempted to leave Italy in search of regular first-team football. 

Reports in Italy have previously suggested that Milan are reluctant to sell the player, who made his professional debut for the club aged 16 in a Champions League match in 2011 - becoming the third youngest player to play for the club.
