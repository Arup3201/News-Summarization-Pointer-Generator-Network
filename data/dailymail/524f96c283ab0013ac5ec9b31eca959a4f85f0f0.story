Prince George has already been deluged with gifts from the great and the good but there is one more on the way – a tricycle sponsored from Boris Johnson.

The London Mayor has ordered the bike to be decked out in the same livery as his Boris Bikes, with the serial number 220713 to represent the Prince's date of birth.

Mr Johnson insisted it was just the thing to ‘acculturate’ the future king to the joys of cycling, with trike even able to be attach to the tandem he gave Kate and William when they married in 2011.

Three-wheeler: Boris Johnson is sending Prince George this tricycle, done out in the livery of his Boris Bikes seen on the capital's streets

Confusion: Boris Johnson seemed a little vague on the details of the trike, but insisted it would be beautiful

The three main party leaders have 
already dispatched to Kensington Palace gifts including an anthology of 
spine-chilling books by Roald Dahl, an apple tree and a blanket 
embroidered by Spanish nuns.

But
Mr Johnson admitted his present is still on the way. Speaking on his 
monthly radio phone-in, he said: ‘I’m sure that all our listeners will 
be thrilled to know we are sending a tricycle.’

Before adding with customary vagueness: ‘I think it has gone, I’m not certain actually.’ 

City Hall later released the image of the trike, with the words 'cycle hire' on the blue logo replaced with Prince George's name.

Asked by LBC 97.3 presenter Nick Ferrari where the tricycle as from, Mr Johnson replied: ‘Pass.

‘I’m afraid I haven’t personally been out shopping. I imagine it’s a beautiful blue.’

But he admitted it he had been told it was a Barclays Tricycle, in tribute to the sponsor of his Boris Bikes which have swept across London.

Aides later insisted there is no Barclays branding on the tricycle, which is designed to link on to a similar tandem given to the royal couple when they tied the knot, allowing the family of three to enjoy peddling around Kensington Gardens.

Mr Johnson added: ‘My memory is, we are sending a beautiful bouncing blue tricycle to get him on a bike at the earliest possible opportunity and to acculturate him to the join of cycling.’

Showered with gifts: Kensington Palace has been inundated with messages from well wishers since Prince George of Cambridge was born last week

The Duke of Cambridge and Duchess of Cambridge had asked for donations to good causes instead of being sent presents

Kate and William asked for donations to charity rather than wasteful gifts but last week Britain’s political leaders revealed the bizarre list of present they had sent to Prince George.

Prime Minister David Cameron and wife Samantha gave a box-set of books by Roald Dahl,
whose works famously include George’s Marvelous Medicine.

Dahl’s
many hits include Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and Matilda - 
musical versions of which are both currently entertaining audiences in 
London’s West End - as well as Fantastic Mr Fox, The Twits and the dark 
scare story The Witches.

have thrilled youngsters and adults for generations

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge may 
have to wait a few years before reading the tales to their first son - 
born 10 days ago - as Dahl’s anarchic and sometimes spine-chilling works
are generally enjoyed by children who are well beyond the toddler 
years.

Liberal
Democrat leader Nick Clegg and his wife Miriam sent proud parents 
William and Kate a big bag of coffee to help them cope with the fatigue 
caused by sleepless nights caring for their new baby.

The
Cleggs also gave George a white cot cover and sheet hand-embroidered by
nuns in Miriam’s home village in Spain, where the DPM was holidaying at
the time of the royal birth last week.

Speaking on his regular Call Clegg phone-in on LBC 97.3 radio, Mr Clegg said: ‘The gift actually comes in two parts'

Mr Clegg added: ‘We found some 
beautiful, I think anyway, beautiful cover, a cot cover and a cot sheet 
which is hand embroidered in a convent in the village where Miriam comes
from in Spain, where I was a few days ago.

‘The
nuns, they make these beautiful handmade things so we’ve sent that and 
we’ve thrown in with a gift, a large bag of our favourite coffee because
as parents of little boys, we know you need that coffee when you’re 
coping with little boys.

‘Miriam and I sent a letter with a gift just yesterday to Kensington Palace.’

Labour leader Ed Miliband gave a three-year-old apple tree – a traditional gift for a first-born son.

It
already has some fruit growing on it and was sourced from local 
community groups the Brent Eleven Streets residents association and the 
London Orchard Project.
