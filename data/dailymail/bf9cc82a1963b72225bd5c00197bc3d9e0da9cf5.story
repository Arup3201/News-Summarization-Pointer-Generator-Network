Under arrest: A mugshot of Kevin Kamooneh taken by police as they held him for 'stealing' electricity from a car-charging station at a Georgia school

An eco-conscious father has vowed to fight misdemeanour theft charges after he was arrested and held in jail overnight for plugging his electric car into a charging point at a school.

Kaveh Kamooneh, 50, admitted charging his car at Chamblee Middle School in Chamblee, Georgia, but insists he had no idea that he wasn't allowed to.

It's not clear how much electricity he used in charging his car, but Kamooneh said it was likely to have been worth only a few pennies.

The former university professor turned investment advisor told ABC News: 'I'm waiting for them to arrest water drinkers and cell phone chargers.'

Kamooneh had been plugging his car into the school's electric car charging station on Saturdays for several weeks while his son was having tennis lessons on courts nearby.

It was one Saturday last month when he walked over from the lesson to find a Chamblee policeman inside his white Nissan Leaf, which was parked about 35ft from the tennis court.

At first, said Kamooneh, the officer failed to answer when he asked him why he was in the car, which had been unplugged and its charger left on the ground.

He said he provided his driving license and asked for the officer's information, and was later told the car had been abandoned on public property.

According to ABC, the police officer wrote in his report: 'I asked him why his vehicle was plugged into the power at the school. He told me that was an excepted [sic] practice and that I was making to [sic] much of it. I asked him if he has [sic] asked the Dekalb County school system if he could take the power. He told me that I did not ask if my patrol car can dirty the air - did you? He says "No you did not".'

A statement from the school said that a 'local citizen' contacted police to complain that Kamooneh's car was plugged in at the school.

It added that the DeKalb County School District was cooperating with the investigation into the alleged theft.

Kamooneh says his car was plugged into the outlet for about 20 minutes. An expert told WXIA Atlanta that it is likely it drew about five cents worth of electricity in that time.

Mr Kamooneh was arrested at his home on November 13, on a warrant for misdemeanour theft and spent 14.5 hours at a police station before being released on $150 bail.

Marc Johnson, police chief and city manager of Chamblee, said that if Kamooneh had simply offered to unplug the car then no action would have been taken.

But Kamooneh said the police officer had taken a 'confrontational' attitude after he had questioned his entry into the car, contributing to an uncooperative 'atmosphere'.

'It seemed like he was upset that I wasn't getting scared or wasn't intimidated at his threat of arrest,' he said.

Kamooney said he is confident that when his case goes to court in February that the charge 'is going to be laughed out of court'.
