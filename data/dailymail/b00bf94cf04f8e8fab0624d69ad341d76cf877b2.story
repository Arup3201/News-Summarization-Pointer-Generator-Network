Olympic freestyle skier and Russian pin-up girl Maria Komissarova said she has no feeling from the waist down after breaking and dislocating her spine during training in Sochi.

The skicross racer was taken to a hospital near the Rosa Khutor Extreme Park for emergency surgery after she fractured her 12th dorsal vertebrae in her lower-middle back last Saturday.

Komissarova, 23, was practicing for tomorrow’s contest on the 1,200-meter course, which has nine banked turns and 25 jumps.

During the main competition, six skiers race against each other, with the top three advancing through the heats to the final.

Normally during practice runs, skiers are on the course themselves, or traveling down the mountain in loosely packed bunches.

International Ski Federation spokeswoman Jenny Wiedeke said the accident occurred on a series of jumps near the top of the course and that Komissarova fell while exiting the third jump.

Posting on social networking app Instagram from her hospital bed following a six-and-a-half operation, Komissarova said she is currently paralysed from the waist down.

‘I do not feel my body lower than my belly button,’ she wrote. ‘But I am strong and I know that someday I will definitely be on my feet again.’

Russian president Vladimir Putin stopped by following the operation to give his athlete his best wishes in person.

Komissarova, who won silver in a World Cup medal in ski cross in 2012, was the face of Russian Freestyle Skiing leading up to Sochi.

She is ranked 33rd in the current World Cup standings and recovered from a leg injury last year to qualify for the Olympics.

Russian Fresstyle Ski Federation spokesman Mikhail Verzeba said the operation was successful.

‘When our doctor discusses everything with the hospital medics, we are going to issue a statement and post it on our site,’ he said.

At the same event, Canadian skicross racer Nik Zoricic was killed after crashing near the final jump of a heat in the men's race.
