A sunny Sunday saw Britons race to the coast and hit the fields to make the most of the warm weather – a possible first sign of an Indian summer.

Although autumn officially set off today, the weather gods have not agreed and areas of the south-west saw temperatures hit 23C.

With temperatures expected to hit up for 28C by Wednesday an Indian summer, characterised by unusually warm and dry weather during the autumn months, could be on the way.

In Bournemouth, Dorset, the beach was crowded from early in the morning as sun seekers fought for the best spots.

While some were there just for a day at the beach, thousands had travelled down to watch watch the annual Bournemouth Air Festival.

People were forced to squeeze up for the final day of the specular show that featured marvellous stunts from the Red Arrows.

The resort was jam packed and seafront businesses were doing a roaring trade, with a huge demand for ice cream and 15-minute long queues.

It is believed that more than one million people visited the seaside town over the last four days to watch the air show.

Sarah Wilson, 32, from Poole, was with her son Harry, four, and daughter Lucy, two.

She said: ‘The weather is fantastic, I hope this is a sign of more to come.

‘We haven’t had a summer like this in years, so when I saw it was the first day of September on the calendar I felt disappointed as it means it’s coming to an end.

‘But with a gorgeous day like this it looks like I’m wrong, I’ll be keeping my fingers crossed for an Indian summer.’

An Indian summer is when the weather is warm and dry for a significant period of time after summer has officially ended. Normally this occurs between mid-September and late-October.

Greg Dewhurst, duty forecaster at the Met Office, said: ‘The temperatures are getting warmer this week and we may possibly see highs of 28C.

‘Part of the reason is because over the next few days the wind is expected to change direction to south westerly.

‘We also have an area of high pressure that has remained over the UK.’
