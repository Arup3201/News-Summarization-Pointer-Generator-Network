Garry Monk has backed his former mentor Brendan Rodgers to be the man who saves Mario Balotelli’s career.

Rodgers’ summer gamble has so far looked woefully ill-advised, with Balotelli flopping since joining Liverpool for £16m from AC Milan.

But Monk believes if anyone can draw top form out of the 24-year-old, it is Rodgers, whose side face Swansea in the Capital One Cup last 16 on Tuesday.

Whether Balotelli is open to learning remains to be seen, with suggestions that the club’s losses could be cut at the end of the season, but Monk admired Rodgers’ man-management at Swansea and expects him to transform the Italian.

He said: ‘If anyone is going to do it Brendan can. He’s a very good guy, a very good man manager who is personable and who understands players and different characters.

‘I’d expect him definitely to be the man to do that.’

Monk has thrived in his first season as Swansea’s permanent manager, while his former boss has seen Liverpool struggle following the sale of Luis Suarez and injury to Daniel Sturridge.

Monk, who still consults Rodgers on management dilemmas. added: ‘Brendan’s had to bring in some new players having obviously lost a key one. He’s spent the money on a number of players and it’s a transition period.

‘Sturridge is a big miss as well because he’s a big player. They’ve stuttered a little bit but they’re still a good team. They’ve still got really good players. You go through periods of form like that in your career as teams but they’re more than good enough to bounce back.

‘It’s a transition after losing such an important player who is so hard to replace. I think Brendan is still finding a way to do that but they’ll bounce back because they have very good players.’

Despite Liverpool’s form, Monk makes them the favourites for Tuesday’s Anfield clash. He said: ‘There’s no reason we can’t win but it’s going to be extremely tough. It’s Anfield, we haven’t got a big as squad as them or as a number of teams in this league.’

Swansea’s Neil Taylor injured his knee in the 2-0 win over Leicester on Saturday, but is expected to play.
