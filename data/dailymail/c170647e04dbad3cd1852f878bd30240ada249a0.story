A representative for John Galliano has responded to the outrage over his outfit yesterday that appeared to resemble traditional 
Hasidic Jewish clothing.

The designer, who was fired from 
Christian Dior in March 2011 after several drunken outbursts 
and anti-Semitic remarks in a Paris cafe, was seen before the Oscar de la Renta show yesterday in a long black 
jacket, charcoal homburg-style hat and hair in the style of twirled peyos - long sidelocks grown to demonstrate faith.

But this evening, his spokesperson Liz Rosenberg insisted that the look was nothing more than a high fashion one, and that any suggestion that it was a comment on the Hasidic community is 'totally inaccurate'.

Controversial clothing: John Galliano made a small but loud return to the fashion word yesterday, making his way to Oscar de la Renta's Fashion Week show dressed in an outfit that resembled Hasidic Jewish clothing

'Mr Galliano has worn big hats and 
has had long curly hair for many years,' she told MailOnline. 'He was in
designer attire from head-to-toe including a Stephen Jones hat and 
Yohji Yamamoto pants.'

Ms Rosenberg did not issue any kind of apology for yesterday's outfit, but did state that Mr Galliano 'continues to be committed to 
making amends and seeking forgiveness from the Jewish community for his 
insensitive remarks two years ago.'

She added that 'he remains focused on his sobriety 
daily' and 'has met with Jewish leaders around the world...

'[He] continues to
make a sincere and heartfelt effort to understand his actions and demonstrate his contrition.'

Mr Galliano, who had been helping Oscar de la Renta prepare for last night's 
fall 2013 collection, shocked New York's Jewish community with his enseble yesterday.

'Mr Galliano has worn big hats and 
has had long curly hair for many years. He was in
designer attire from head-to-toe'

Williamsburg community leader Isaac Abraham told the New York Post: 'He’s trying to embarrass people in the Jewish community and make money on clothes [while] dressed like people he has insulted.

'It looks like the hairstyle he added was done purposely to insult,' he added. 'I would invite Mr. de la Renta and 
Galliano to come to Williamsburg, Brooklyn, so I can show them some 
Holocaust survivors and the clothes they [wear].'

Meanwhile rabbi and fashion designer Tobi 
Rubinstein Schneier commented: 'This was not very smart, unless he really 
wants attention. I’m hoping that this is not in any way a mockery 
through this attire.'

Because Galliano was nowhere to be seen 
front-of-house at de la Renta’s Tuesday night show, with visitors unable
to enter backstage, it is unclear if the controversial outfit was seen 
by fashion industry critics at the event.

But after the incident at Paris' La Perle 
cafe, in which Galliano was video-recorded saying 'I love Hitler,' before telling an Italian woman, who wasn't 
Jewish: 'People like you would be dead. Your mothers, your forefathers, 
would all be f****** gassed,' being seen publicly in the distinguishing outfit was enough to ruffle feathers.

Brooklyn Assemblyman Dov Hikind said: 'Who is he mocking? The way the socks look, the jacket, the peyos . . . My question is, who’s he laughing at?

'If it was just anyone else, I wouldn’t 
know what to say. But considering who this guy is, considering his 
background and what he’s said in the past, let him explain it to all of 
us: Are you mocking us?'

Twitter users have also expressed their thoughts on Mr Galliano's outfit choice, which many found 'insulting' and 'shameful'.

Beauty blogger Michelle Jones wrote: 'John Galliano- why? The House that Oscar de la Renta built is giving you a chance- must you mock it?'

'Is John Galliano really so talented that the world must put up with his shameful antics?'

Another tweeted: 'Is John Galliano really so talented that the world must put up with his shameful antics?'

But the fashion industry appears to be coming to the designer's defense. Steven Kolb, CEO of the CFDA, said the attacks against the designer were 'unfair.'

He tweeted this morning: 'That is John's hair and how he dresses and certainly not a mockery of others,' before adding, 'Lets all take a deep breath, relax and remember it's just clothes!'

Others disagreed. Mark Ferdman replied to Mr Kolb, tweeting: 'Show me [a] few more pics of him dressed like that over the past couple months, years and I'll consider that POV.'

Galliano, who faced a maximum of six 
months in jail on charges of 'public insults based on origin, religious 
affiliation, race or ethnicity,' blamed work-related stress 
and multiple substance addictions for his Paris outbursts, which he says he 
can not remember.

He was stripped of his Chevalier of the 
Legion of Honor and ordered to pay suspended fines of 6,000 euros, as well as symbolic
damages and costs to each of his victims and to five anti-racism groups who were also complainants.

Fashion comeback: Galliano was en route to Oscar de la Renta's fall 2013 Fashion Week show held last night; which Galliano spent three weeks helping the designer prepare

But
two years later, Galliano,
who designed Kate Moss' wedding dress in July 2011, seemed hopeful to 
reintegrate himself into the fashion industry after his fall from grace -
the first step being a three week stint at Oscar de la Renta's studio 
in the lead up to his New York Fashion Week show.

'I am an alcoholic,' Galliano 
admitted to WWD last month, before explaining his readiness a return to the industry. 'I 
have been in recovery for the past two years...I remain committed to making amends to those I have hurt.

'Several years prior to my sobriety, I descended into the 
madness of the disease. I said and did things which hurt others, 
especially members of the Jewish community. I have expressed my sorrow 
privately and publicly for the pain which I caused, and I continue to do
so.'

'That is John's hair and how he dresses 
and certainly not a mockery of others... Lets all take a 
deep breath, relax and remember it's just clothes!'

The Anti-Defamation League issued a statement defending the designer today, saying: 'There is no truth to [the] accusation that John Galliano was dressed in Hasidic garb, and anyone familiar with the dress of traditional Orthodox Jews should not mistake what Galliano is wearing in the photograph as ‘Hasidic garb.

'Hasidim do not wear fedora hats, pinstripe pants, blue jackets or an ascot tie,' he wrote.

De la Renta, who called Galliano an 'immense talent,' also said last month: 'I think John is doing all the right things.
Everyone in life deserves a second chance, especially someone as 
talented as John. I think that life is about forgiving and helping 
people.…I think John is doing all the right things.'

Whether or not yesterday's outfit constitutes 'doing the right thing,' is debatable, however.

One observing Lower East Side resident 
told MailOnline: 'Either Galliano is so deluded that he thinks wearing 
an outfit inspired by the dress of Hasidic Jews is some kind of apology,
or it is simply another callous insult from someone who is already 
known as a drunken anti-Semite. Either way he's an a**hole.'
