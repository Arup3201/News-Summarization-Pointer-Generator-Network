A yacht carrying around £40million of cocaine headed for the UK has been seized after a dramatic chase off the Caribbean island of Martinique.

The vessel - SY Hygeia of Halsa - was boarded by French customs and two men from Jersey have been arrested after officers discovered around 250kg of the Class A drug.

It followed an investigation involving the Metropolitan Police, their French counterparts and officials from the National Crime Agency (NCA). 

The SY Hygeia of Halsa (pictured) was intercepted as it began a transatlantic crossing and found to be carrying cocaine with a street value of around £40 million

Two men from Jersey, aged 57 and 42, were arrested and could face prosecution by the French authorities

They had been following a London-based organised crime group, with connections to the Caribbean, suspected of being involved in the large-scale importation of class A drugs. 

Officers accosted the UK-registered ship  off the island of Martinique on Monday as it began a transatlantic crossing.

Two men, aged 57 and 42, were arrested and now face possible prosecution by the French authorities.

Hank Cole, the NCA's head of international operations, said: 'Together we have stopped a huge consignment of cocaine close to source.

'We have no doubt that without this intervention the drugs would have ended up on the streets of the UK where, after being cut, they would have had a likely potential value of between £30-40 million.

The haul of cocaine - around 250kg - which was discovered by French customs on board the vessel on Monday

'Our investigation into the organised crime network involved in this attempt continues.' 

Detective Superintendent Neil Thompson said: 'It is clear that the drugs recovered would have been distributed throughout the streets of London and beyond, generating further criminality and fuelling gang activity.

'If you deal in drugs in any scale we will find you, we will arrest you, and you will face the consequences of your actions.'

This is the second significant seizure of Class A drugs on a sailing vessel destined for the UK in recent weeks.

Two months ago, around a tonne of cocaine was seized by the Irish Naval Service acting on information supplied by the NCA.

It followed an investigation involving the Metropolitan Police, their French counterparts and officials from the National Crime Agency (NCA)
