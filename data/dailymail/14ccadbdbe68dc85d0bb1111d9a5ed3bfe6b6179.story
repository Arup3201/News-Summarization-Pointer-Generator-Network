President Barack Obama insisted on Tuesday that he'll do 'what's necessary' to destroy terrorists who 'plot against America' but warned it will 'take time' - hours after launching airstrikes in Syria.

'Once again it must be clear to anyone who would plot against America and try to do Americans harm that we will not tolerate safe havens for terrorists who threaten our people,' the president said.

Obama's remarks followed an announcement from the Pentagon on Monday night that the U.S. and a coalition of five Arab nations launched airstrikes on the Islamic State in Syria. 

The U.S. also bombed a separate al Qaeda-affiliated terrorist group it believed posed an 'imminent threat to American interests', the Pentagon said.

Speaking from the White House lawn ahead of trip to New York for a United Nations meeting, Obama said the involvement of the Arab nations 'makes it clear to the world that this is not America's fight alone.'

The president's decision to authorize strikes in Syria earned the support of even his top critics in Congress, many of whom have been urging the president to bomb the country for months.

The lawmakers made a point of noting that Obama waited far too long to take their advice but said belated action was better than no action. 

According to a statement issued by U.S. Central Command, CENTCOM, the U.S., along with Jordan, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Bahrain, carried out strikes overnight against Islamic extremists in Syria. 

CENTCOM said Tuesday that the joint 'strikes destroyed or damaged multiple ISIL targets in the vicinity of Ar Raqqah, Dayr az Zawr, Al Hasakah, and Abu Kamal and included ISIL fighters, training compounds, headquarters and command and control facilities, storage facilities, a finance center, supply trucks and armed vehicles.

'All aircraft safely exited the strike areas,' the statement said.

'America's proud to stand shoulder to shoulder with these nations on behalf of our common security,' Obama said in his own statement today.

Acting on it's own, the U.S. launched an additional eight air strikes last night, CENTCOM said today, on the Al Qaeda linked Khorasan Group to 'disrupt imminent attack plotting against the United States and Western interests.' 

Those strikes were made on targets west of Allepo.

The President's decision to bomb terrorist cells in Syria on Monday was not entirely unexpected. Obama indicated in an address to the nation on September 10 that he would soon expand military strikes from Iraq to the neighboring country.

'I will not hesitate to take action against ISIL in Syria, as well as Iraq,' he said. 'This is a core principle of my presidency: If you threaten America, you will find no safe haven.'

Obama reiterated today that the U.S. and a 'broad coalition' of 40 nations would work to cut off the Islamic State's funding and 'counter its hateful ideology' in addition to taking military action against the radical terrorist group. 

The U.S. has been attacking the barbaric terrorist group by air since early August. Already the U.S. has launched roughly 190 strikes on the group as part of it's effort to 'destroy and degrade' it.

A chorus of of lawmakers, including some of the president's biggest detractors, lauded Obama on Monday for ramping up action against ISIS and called on the rest of the country to get behind him.

'This is a very, very positive step and I think it’s really important for all of us to come together,' Republican Rep. Pete King said Monday evening on The Kelly File. 'Whatever happened in the past, that’s behind us.'

House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Mike McCaul concurred in a statement on Monday.

'When in times of war and of peace it is important that we come together as a nation,' the Texas Republican said. 'To defeat ISIS, we must cut off the head of the snake, which exists in Syria.'

Arguing that the strikes on ISIS in Syria are 'long overdue,' House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ed Royce, a Republican from California, said in a statement on Tuesday that an 'effective campaign to destroy ISIL can’t be limited to one side of the border between Iraq and Syria.'

'While this initial attack will be a big psychological blow to the terrorist group, an air campaign will need to be major and sustained,' he said. 

Likewise, House Speaker John Boehner said his support for the move was based on his 'understanding that this is just one step in what must be a larger effort to destroy and defeat this terrorist organization.'

Obama said this morning that he was 'pleased' to know he has bipartisan support for the actions he's taking. 

'America's always stronger when we stand united,' he said, 'and that unity sends a powerful message to the world that we'll do what's necessary to defend our country.'

While lawmakers from both political parties agree that Obama needs to go on offense against ISIS in both Iraq and Syria, there's no consensus on Obama's ability to continue strikes in Iraq beyond October 7 without first receiving approval from Congress.

On that day the president's authority to engage in military action in the country under the War Powers Act will expire. The 1973 legislation mandates that the president must receive Congress' blessing to go to war with a country for more than 60 days.

Obama declared last month that he has the jurisdiction to bomb both Syria and Iraq through an Authorization for Use of Military Force resolution passed in the wake of 9/11.

That resolution gave the President of the United States permission to use 'all necessary and appropriate force against those nations, organizations, or persons he determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001, or harbored such organizations or persons, in order to prevent any future acts of international terrorism against the United States by such nations, organizations or persons.'

The White House says that the Islamic State's rise from Al Qaeda provides the legal justification for Obama to carry out airstrikes against any group in any country outside the U.S. that he believes is a terrorist threat.

Resistance to Obama using the 13-year-old AUMF cuts across party lines in Congress, with top Dems like House Armed Services ranking member Adam Smith and libertarians like Sen. Rand Paul siding against the White House.

'The Constitution is very clear. The power to declare war resides in Congress,' Paul tweeted after Obama's address to the nation earlier this month.  

Both chambers of Congress recessed last week until after November's federal elections without voting to authorize continued strikes on ISIS.

Smith revealed Tuesday that House Democrats will consider asking the Speaker to reconvene Congress in order to take a vote in light of Monday's dramatic expansion of U.S. military efforts against the Islamic State.

'This is, without question, war,' Smith told MSNBC's Rachel Maddow in a phone interview on Tuesday morning. 'This is something that Congress should authorize.'

Republican Rep. Bradley Byrne said in a tweet Tuesday morning that while he does 'believe air strikes in Syria are necessary' he continues to be 'concerned' Obama does not have the legal authority to take military action in Syria.

'A new "Authorization for Use of Military Force" is sorely needed,' Byrne said in a follow-up tweet. 'I would support returning to Washington to debate and vote on a new AUMF.' 

Meanwhile, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio noted in a statement that he's 'argued for months' that President Obama 'has the authority to confront' ISIS.

'Defeating this menace to all who value freedom and tolerance will not be easy, but is essential to our security,' he said.
