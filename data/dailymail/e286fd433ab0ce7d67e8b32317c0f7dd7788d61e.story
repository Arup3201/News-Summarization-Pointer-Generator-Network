The proud father of a teenage footballer became £10,000 richer yesterday when his son played for Manchester United.

Midfielder Ryan Tunnicliffe, 19, came on for his debut in the 76th minute of Wednesday night's Capital One Cup win over Newcastle.

His father, Mick, placed a £100 bet when his son was nine that he would one day play for the team - at the odds of 100-1.

And when footballer Marnick Vermijl was replaced during the 2-1 win, Mick's moment came.

He pocketed a staggering £10,000 following his son's glory.

There could be worse to  come for 
bookmakers William Hill, who revealed they also took another bet from 
Tunnicliffe's dad of £100 at odds of 350/1 that the young midfielder 
will one day play for England at some stage in his career.

The wager could net Mick a whopping £35,000 payout.

'The
last time a bet of this nature cost us £10,000 was when Chris Kirkland 
made his debut in goal for England, also landing a £100 bet for his 
father,' said Hill’s spokesman Graham Sharpe.

'We will obviously be paying close attention to the progress of Ryan’s career in the future.'

Ryan, who spent last season under the tutelage of Sir Alex Ferguson's son, Darren, on loan at Peterborough United, was one of a number of youngsters blooded on Wednesday night.

Winger Robbie Brady and defenders Scott Wootton and Michael Keane were also given run-outs by Ferguson at Old Trafford as United cruised through to a tricky fourth round meeting with Chelsea.
