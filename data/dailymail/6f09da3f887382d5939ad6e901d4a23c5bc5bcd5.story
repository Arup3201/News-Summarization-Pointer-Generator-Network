Indian cricket authorities have been forced to back down after a spokesman made an insensitive remark about cancelling a tour game because of felled batsman Phillip Hughes. 

A practice tour match between India and Australia was set to be held today and Indian officials initially refused to postpone the match after Hughes, 25, collapsed on the pitch on Tuesday. 

In a disrespectful remark, a spokesman for the Board of Control for Cricket in India had told The Daily Telegraph: 'Postponed because of one player? I don't think so.'

But the team backed down on Thursday after learning that Hughes was on death's door, defusing a potentially explosive decision out of respect for the family and friends of the cricketer.

In a separate incident, Sydney Morning Herald columnist Ben Pobjie was savaged by newspapers and readers alike when he used the tragedy to stick the boot into Prime Minister Tony Abbott in a misguided tweet. 

'Sean Abbott hits Phil Hughes in the head, continuing the tradition of Abbotts f***ing up Australia,' he tweeted. 

Pobjie later said he tweeted 'before it was known Hughes was seriously injured' and deleted the insensitive message after the situation became clear. 

The Fairfax columnist came under attack on Twitter after the remarks. He later apologised

'I’m not going to say anything more about it, because right now all anyone should be doing is thinking of Phil and his loved ones,' he said.  

Cricket Australia chief James Sutherland will hold a press conference at 10:30am AEDT on Friday morning.

An update is expected on whether the Test against India will go ahead next week, given the devastated state of so many Australian players. 

Touching pictures emerged from the sub-continent on Friday morning of two Indian teams gathering in respect of Hughes prior to a match in Kolkata.
