Royal officials were accused of ‘insulting the war dead’ yesterday after installing a portable lavatory at a war memorial where a wreath from Prince Charles is on display.

The ugly temporary lavatory and workmen’s canteen at the Commonwealth Memorial Gates – 100 yards from Buckingham Palace – provoked complaints from families who went there to pay their respects to family members who died in two world wars.

The structure was put there by Royal Parks chiefs who say it is needed while repairs are carried out to the memorial – but they could not explain why the Armadillo portable lavatory was not placed a discreet distance away.

The temporary toilet block has been placed beside the Commonwealth Memorial Gates in London 

Wreaths from Prince Charles and other VIPs were laid at the memorial on Commonwealth Day earlier this year, and thousands of people from Commonwealth countries have visited the site in recent weeks to mark the centenary of the outbreak of the First World War.

The memorial in Constitution Hill, by Hyde Park Corner, was unveiled by the Queen in 2002. Yesterday, Indian-born Baroness Shreela Flather – a friend of Margaret Thatcher – who led the campaign to raise the £2.5 million to build the memorial, said: ‘To put an eyesore on this memorial is an insult to the brave men and women from the Commonwealth who died for this country.

‘It is beyond belief that anyone should do this at any time, let alone so close to the commemoration of the First World War when this matter is so close to everyone’s hearts. It should be moved away where it does not desecrate this sacred and beautiful monument. I’m sure the Queen would be horrified if she knew about it.’

A Royal Parks spokesperson said they were conducted work at the site in advance of Remembrance Sunday

One Commonwealth visitor to the memorial told The Mail on Sunday: ‘I was very disappointed to see a portable toilet at the memorial. It is very disrespectful. I tried to complain about it but could not get through on the phone.’ Another said: ‘I just don’t understand why anyone would build a wonderful memorial like this and then spoil it so thoughtlessly. There is plenty of grass in the park to the side of the memorial. If they had a little sensitivity, they would have put it there. It’s the product of the jobsworth mentality.’

Hours after The Mail on Sunday contacted the Royal Parks, officials made an apology and a team of workmen was sent to ‘smarten up’ the temporary fixture.

A Royal Parks spokesman said yesterday: ‘We are sorry and are trying to make the works more in keeping with the park and memorial. There are workmen down at the site at the moment making sure that the repairs are more in keeping with the memorial.’

The spokesman said the repairs were needed to make the site ‘look its best’ for Remembrance Sunday celebrations in November.

The Memorial Gates commemorate the five million people from the former British Empire, including the Indian subcontinent, Africa and the Caribbean, who fought for Britain in the two world wars.

It lists the names of the 74 Commonwealth volunteers who were awarded the Victoria Cross or George Cross in the conflicts.
