Comic Relief has called in watchdogs to investigate claims that up to £250,000 donated by the British public to help poor Africans may not have been used for charity.

A Ugandan charity is said to have been given £450,000 for health and education projects following Comic Relief’s telethon appeals for cash.

But it was alleged yesterday that £50,000 of the sum handed to the Busoga Association UK went to consultants who arranged the charity’s bid for a donation – a large amount for this type of work. And up to £200,000 is still ‘unaccounted for’, it was claimed.

The Charity Commission, which is under fire over its failure to detect fraud, was contacted by Comic Relief four months ago.

Yesterday, however, a spokesman for the watchdog said it is still ‘seeking a meeting’ with the London-based Ugandan charity’s trustees and has not decided whether to mount a formal investigation.

A report last year by the National Fraud Authority found charities estimate they lose £1.1billion a year to fraud. The latest claims  raise more questions about the effectiveness of the Commission, whose chairman admitted recently to MPs on the Commons Public Accounts Committee that it  carries out only 20 compliance visits a year, although it regulates 160,000 charities.

Steve Barclay MP, who sits on the 
committee, said: ‘The Charity Commission isn’t fit for purpose. I’m 
concerned to hear once again they have been slow to act and use the 
powers available to them.  People give money to good causes in good 
faith and put their faith in the Charity Commission to ensure their 
hard-earned money is well spent.

‘They have powers to suspend trustees, launch statutory inquiries and freeze accounts and yet this rarely happens.

‘Only one trustee has been removed from a charity in the past four years.’ The Charity Commission spokesman said they were approached by Comic Relief ‘expressing concern about funding it has provided to the Busoga Association UK on the basis that insufficient accounting records have been made available to confirm how the grants were applied.

‘The Commission has sought a meeting with the trustees of the charity to discuss what evidence exists concerning the use of the funds in question, together with the charity’s governance and financial management arrangements.

‘Before that meeting the Commission has not formed a view of what the outcome will be in terms of any regulatory advice or action’.

The charity, based in Dalston, north-east London, could not be reached by telephone or email yesterday. It was set up in 1996 to help families integrate into the UK, but also has projects in Uganda, including helping women in slum areas.

Comic Relief, which has made £800million of grants to charities since it was founded in 1985, said it ‘vigorously’ pursued any abuse of funding and that fraud was rare.

A spokesman said: ‘We vigilantly monitor for attempts to misuse funds and to this end maintain rigorous application and checking systems.’
