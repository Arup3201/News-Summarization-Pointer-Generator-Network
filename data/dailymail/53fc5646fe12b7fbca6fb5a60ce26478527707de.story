It was meant to be a celebration of Britain's historic cruise liner.

But the crowds lined up along the Mersey were somewhat distracted by a slightly more futuristic model.

As the MS Queen Victoria Cunard liner cruised into Liverpool, a self-styled 'rocketman' soared alongside on a flyboard - 45ft in the air.

Jay St John glided into the ceremony along the river on what appeared to be a skateboard.

Moments later, he was flung into the air, sending a foundation of water in his wake.

He was even able to greet the captain Commodore Christopher Rynd as he hovered level with the deck.

The otherworldly mode of transport works by sucking up water through a tube, before blowing it out of two jet nozzles.

It is controlled by the rider moving their feet.

Nozzles attached to the hands act as ski poles.

The rider starts by lying face-down in the water, bending their knees, and setting off.

Created in 2011 by jet ski rider Franky Zapata, the flyboard became a success after he posted a video on YouTube.

There is now a Flyboarding World Cup every November, which will this year see Mr St John competing against riders from across the globe including Poland, Egypt, Bermuda and the USA.
