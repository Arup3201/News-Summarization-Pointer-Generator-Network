Tough: Research by the British Heart Foundation found that 82 per cent of smokers have unsuccessfully tried to quit at some stage

The average smoker has made four failed attempts to quit and nearly a quarter have lost count of the number of times they have tried to give up.

Despite a decline in smoking across the UK, 20 per cent of smokers said they simply cannot quit, according to research.

A study carried out by the British Heart Foundation found that 82 per cent of smokers have unsuccessfully tried to quit at one stage.

Of the 2,010 smokers questioned, more than one in ten said they are ‘desperate’ to beat the addiction.

The research found that 40 per cent of smokers have made between four and 21 attempts to quit

The report calls on the government to implement new laws and strip away the 'glamour' of smoking by introducing ‘standardised’ packaging.

It also urges local authorities to increase help available to struggling smokers via local support services.

Dr Mike Knapton, Associate Medical Director for the BHF, said: 'Every year more than 100,000 smokers die because of their addiction.

'This addiction can be incredibly hard to break and we hear time and again of smokers who are absolutely desperate to quit, they just don’t know where to start.

The report reveals that a quarter of 
smokers are more motivated to give up for financial reasons rather than 
to benefit their health.

Dr Knapton added: 'The downward trend 
in smoking rates has plateaued in recent years, proving we need to renew
our efforts to help our ‘final fifth’ quit.

'Often these are long-term smokers, or people surrounded by family, friends and colleagues who smoke.

Desperation: Of the 2,010 smokers questioned, more than one in ten said they are 'desperate' to beat the addiction

'They’re harder to reach, and they’ll probably find it hard to quit.

'That’s why we all need to reinvigorate our efforts to help smokers and UK governments are part of the mix.

'We need investment in local stop smoking services and measures such as standardised packaging to help protect our children from the fatal addiction so many people are currently battling with.'
