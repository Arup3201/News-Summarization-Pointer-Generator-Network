Dream role: Charlotte Wakefield as the governess in this summer's production of The Sound of Music

Charlotte Wakefield – otherwise known as
‘the new Julie Andrews’ – is fizzing with excitement. At only 22, she 
is receiving the sort of rave reviews that actors dream of all their 
lives. Her current performance as Maria in The Sound of Music at Regent’s Park Open Air Theatre in London has been described as ‘superb’.

Georgina Brown, The Mail on Sunday’s theatre critic, whose review can be found in Event magazine, gives the musical five stars and advises readers to ‘climb every mountain, ford every stream, follow every rainbow, do whatever you need to get a ticket’.

Even Bert Fink, European senior vice-president of the Rodgers and Hammerstein organisation, who has seen more versions of the musical than he can count, thinks she’s ‘wonderful, wonderful’.

The production is the summer’s hottest ticket, and Charlotte is clearly on the verge of stardom. Yet it’s not only her youth that makes her talent so remarkable. She owes the drive that has made her success possible to climbing a substantial mountain of her own.

She suffered years of bullying at school and went through a period  of unemployment in which she so despaired of ever working again that she put on almost two stone by  comfort eating.

But the real source of her determination to achieve her dream is her sister, Ellie, who had a devastating stroke soon after birth and suffers from learning difficulties. Ellie, now 16, is Charlotte’s inspiration.

‘She is a lot like me – opinionated, strong-willed and passionate,’ says Charlotte. ‘She has taught me patience and understanding and when I think of the amazing things she could do if she was fine it makes me feel I don’t want to waste any of my own talent.’

Taking on an iconic and demanding role in a musical that has been seen  by virtually everyone is no easy task. Charlotte flicks back her specially dyed and dramatically cropped blonde hair as she discusses the daunting prospect of donning the famous Julie Andrews wimple.  

‘My gran had the video and I used to watch it all the time as a child. It was nerve-racking to take over from Julie Andrews and initially I felt I wouldn’t be able to do it.

‘But when I read the stage script, which is slightly different to the film version, I saw a naivety and youthful energy in Maria that I felt nobody had really seen before.

Mary Poppins creator Pamela Travers so disliked the 1964 Walt Disney film version of her stories about the magical nanny that she tried to stop the company adapting them for the West End stage.

Sir Cameron Mackintosh, who eventually co-produced the stage adaptation, has revealed how the Australian-born author repeatedly turned down requests from Disney to produce a theatrical version.

‘For 30 years she wouldn’t even agree to meet them,’ he said.

Sir Cameron has spoken out as a new Hollywood film called Saving Mr Banks promises to shed fresh light on the making of the 1964 film. Emma Thompson plays the role of Travers while Tom Hanks portrays Disney.

In one scene Travers tells Disney: ‘Mary Poppins is not for sale. I won’t have her turned into one of your silly cartoons.’

Sir Cameron – who negotiated with Travers about a stage production in 1993, three years before she died – insisted that any stage version would need to combine elements of her books and the Walt Disney film.

He said: ‘I think she realised  it was the best chance of getting a musical nearer to what she wanted.’

No one from Walt Disney was available for comment last night.

‘She was supposed to be 22, the age I am now, and Julie Andrews was 30 when she played her. So it’s not surprising that her performance was quite staid and controlled. I felt I could give the role a younger, sexier, more modern edge. It also helped that I could see a lot of myself in Maria. We are both enthusiastic and driven and throw ourselves wholeheartedly into everything we do.’

Charlotte’s talents were obvious early on. She went to ballet and tap lessons and starred in theatre productions. Although her school, Knutsford High in Cheshire, was proud of her success, other students began verbally bullying her. ‘I think it was based on jealousy,’ she says carefully.

‘Looking back, I can see it helped me build a thick skin. It’s something you need to have in this industry. Luckily, I am still very sensitive underneath.’

This is partly due to Ellie, whom Charlotte adores. ‘I was six when Ellie was born,’ she recalls. ‘She could have been very disabled but fortunately she only has mild special needs. She manages at Knutsford High School with some extra help. I think of her as my baby sister and am very protective of her.

‘She has recently won an award at school for being the most inspiring student. I’m particularly proud as she was nominated by the other pupils, which for a child who struggles with her speech is amazing and really choked me up.’

Charlotte left school after GCSEs, making the difficult decision not to go on to A-levels and drama training when she was offered the part of Wendla in the rock musical Spring Awakening in the West End.

‘I had a blast but then suddenly, when I was 19, everything came to an abrupt stop. I kept going to auditions but didn’t get anything. I didn’t know how to deal with the inactivity and not earning.

‘I was living alone in London and I was really sad. I put on about two stone eating chocolate and other comfort food. I was out of work for six months and thought I’d never work again, but I auditioned for the part of Sophie in the touring version of Mamma Mia! I got it and spent a year going around the world.’

She later joined the West End cast and, while performing at night, auditioned for The Sound Of Music during the day. ‘I did six auditions and thought I might get the part of Liesl, the eldest of von Trapp’s seven  children. Instead they offered  me Maria, which was really scary.  It made me work hard on my voice because singing in The Sound Of Music is very different from singing Abba pop songs.’

It obviously paid off. Her voice is sweet, emotional and powerful – the equal of Julie Andrews.

‘Being in The Sound Of Music is a brilliant experience,’ she says. ‘I particularly love doing it in the open air. It’s funny to think I’m at the age when I thought I would be graduating from drama school. Instead, I’m astounded by the reviews and having the most amazing time.’

Judging by the rapturous cheers and applause that echo through Regent’s Park every evening, so is the audience.
