Swarms of lake flies are invading the Lake Winnebago area — clinging to everything in sight and leaving behind a green mess when squished.

'You just learn to walk with your eyes kind of half shut, and you don't wear real light clothes,' said Steven Spanbauer has lived on the west shore of Lake Winnebago for 27 years. 'Other than that, they don't really affect much.'

Lake flies typically emerge around Mother's Day but cool weather delayed this year's hatch.

What's that noise? The annual Lake Winnebago lake fly hatch is in full swing, with huge numbers staging an aerial assault on High Cliff State Park, in Sherwood, Wisconsin

Biblical invasion: Lake flies typically emerge around Mother's Day but this year's hatch was delayed by the cool spring weather. Lake flies don't have mouths, so they don't bite or eat vegetation

Sight to behold: The annual Lake Winnebago lake fly hatch is on! Swarms of the large, one-inch, harmless flies have invaded High Cliff State Park, Sherwood, creating one of the largest hatches in many years

They live throughout Lake Winnebago and the upper lakes and die within one to three weeks of hatching. Lake flies don't have mouths, so they don't bite.

Scott Koehnke, a water management specialist for the state Department of Natural Resources, said warmer temperatures this week will result in a bumper crop of lake flies.

The lake flies spend the majority of their life in water, emerging only for a brief period as adults to mate. Sturgeon, perch and walleye feed on the larvae, known as red worms or blood worms, and pupae.

Landing wherever: Lake flies coat a garage at a home in Oshkosh, Wisconsin. There's a constant buzzing along the shoreline of Lake Winnebago

It¿s a sure sign of spring: Thick clouds of buzzing buggers known as lake flies are bothering fishermen and homeowners near Lake Winnebago ¿ and also folks near Lake Michigan

Perfect swarm: The lake flies are particularly bad this year. She told us the recent storms then heat and sunlight created perfect conditions for the hatch

'They are the staple food source for the lake sturgeon throughout most of the year, as well as they're being consumed by pretty much any other fish out there,' said Ryan Koenigs, a DNR fisheries biologist. 'I've seen walleye stomachs that are loaded with lake fly pupae.'

Koehnke said the current hatch will help migrating birds, which have struggled to find food in the cool spring. Purple martins and swallows had delayed nesting because of the lack of food.

It will also benefit other birds that already are nesting or feeding their young.

'It's going to be a food source that's not always available at this time of the year,' Koehnke said.

Mixed opinions: While the lake flies are are annoying, they don¿t pose any dangers to humans and they even provide some benefits to other animals

Circle of flies: The lake flies live as adults only a couple of weeks. They reproduce, lay their eggs in the water, die and the cycle starts over again

Tasty! Sturgeon and other fish are actually consuming the lake flies in the larvae and pupae stages, when they¿re in the water. Birds are also feasting on the adult flies

The life span of a lake fly is extremely short with many living for just a few days after hatching

On the ground a countless number of dead flies are visible

Normally the flies hatch around Mother's Day, but the cold this year delayed their arrival

Unlike mosquitoes, lake flies are harmless to humans

They also serve as a valuable food source for hundreds of other species that live in the lake
