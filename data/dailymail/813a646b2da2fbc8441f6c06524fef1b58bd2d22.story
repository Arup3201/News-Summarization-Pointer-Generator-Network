A probation officer who gave a domestic abuse victim’s new address to her alleged attacker has been fined just £150.

Victoria Idowu sent the suspect a text message containing the woman’s full name, new address and date of birth.

When the victim found out, she called police in fear, then moved house. She later cut off all contact with social services and police.

The investigation against the alleged perpetrator – the woman’s partner – was later dropped.

Idowu was working for the London Probation Trust when she contacted the Multi-Agency Risk Assessment Conference for details on the alleged abuser in January last year.

She claims she then passed on the confidential details of the victim to him in an attempt to prevent a case of mistaken identity.

Idowu, 39, of Stockwell, south London, has since been sacked for gross misconduct.

Yesterday the mother of one was fined £150 with £270 costs after pleading guilty to breaching the Data Protection Act at Camberwell Green Magistrates’ Court.

Sentencing her, District Judge Richard Hawgood said: ‘I am at a loss to know why a competent, experienced probation officer would have made the disclosure that you did. It really beggars belief.

‘It has been quite frankly a disaster for the victim of the offence, and a disaster for yourself.’

After the hearing, Idowu said she was also a victim of domestic abuse and would never have given out the information if she wasn’t completely sure the abuser already knew the victim’s address.

She said: ‘I knew that he knew her address already. He had visited her at the house.

‘The man manipulated me and said it was his brother who was the abuser but it turned out it was him.

‘I made an error and it has bitten me a lot. I’m a victim myself and that is why I left my long-term partner when I was pregnant and I wouldn’t have told him any more information than he already knew.’

Karen Ingala Smith, chief executive of domestic violence charity nia, said the case exposed a ‘systematic failure’ in the treatment of victims.

‘This isn’t just about Victoria Idowu,’ she said. ‘There is a systematic failure to respond adequately to violence against women.

‘For too long governments have focused on it as a criminal justice issue if at all. But women continue to be failed.’

She added: ‘Women are at greatest risk of being murdered at the point of separation or after leaving a  violent partner. Domestic violence has killed an average of two women a week for at least the last ten years.’

Unlawfully obtaining or accessing personal data is a criminal offence under section 55 of the Data Protection Act 1998.

The offence is punishable by way of ‘fine only’ – up to £5,000 in a magistrates court or an unlimited fine in a crown court.

The Information Commissioner’s Office, which brought the case against Idowu, yesterday called on the Government to introduce tougher sentences on the unlawful use of personal information.

Commissioner Christopher Graham, said: ‘This is the unpleasant but unremarkable face of data protection crime – not journalists, not lawyers, just individuals for whom the sentence holds no terror.

‘Idowu escaped with only a relatively minor penalty. The Government must act now to introduce tougher penalties.’

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
