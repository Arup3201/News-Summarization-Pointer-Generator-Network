A rookie driver was cleared of dangerous driving for allowing drunken youths to ‘surf’ on the bonnet of his car minutes before he accidentally ran over and killed a close friend.

Youcef Adjerid, 18, drove a short distance with one youth on the front of his Fiat Punto before he hit his brakes and sent him flying into the road.

Tragic Toby Hearne - who had been to a fancy dress party dressed as a Christmas present - then got on the bonnet and managed to hold on when Adjerid, of Chippenham, Wiltshire, stopped sharply.

But moments later Toby lay down in the road near the car and Adjerid failed to see him and drove over him.

Mr Hearne suffered catastrophic chest injuries and died instantly at the scene in Stanton St Quintin, Wiltshire.

Police questioned Adjerid, who had not been drinking, but he was not charged over the death in the early hours of December 22, 2011.

A coroner later ruled that Mr Hearne died as the result of an accident when his judgement was impaired by alcohol.

Adjerid - who had passed his test just two weeks earlier - was however charged with dangerous or careless driving over the car surfing stunt.

Swindon Crown Court heard how Adjerid turned up late at a house party just as it was ending.

On the way he came across four friends - Sam Riley, Joe Bodman, Hal Bailey, and tragic Mr Hearne.

Mr Riley and Mr Hearne decided to climb on to the bonnet of his car and took turns to ‘car surf’ as he drove along at walking pace.

Adjerid laughed as he slammed on his brakes and threw Mr Riley to the ground and then repeated the stunt with pal Mr Hearne, who managed to stay on when he stopped.

A jury, who had not been told of the death of Mr Hearne, took just over an hour to clear Adjerid of all charges.

Outside court Adjerid said: 'My year has been incredibly hard. It has been a very difficult time after what happened.

'This brings closure to a difficult chapter in my life and I just want to move on now.'

One of Adjerid’s friends told the inquest into Mr Hearne’s death: 'I saw clearly what happened.

'I saw him lay down but no-one in the car had seen that he had gone to the floor. I thought he was joking about.

'Youcef was talking to Sam at the driver’s window and I don’t think he had seen Toby lying on the floor as otherwise he wouldn’t have driven off.'
