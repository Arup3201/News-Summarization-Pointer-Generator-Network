A unique library has been constructed from seven creatively-adapted shipping containers in Batu, Indonesia.  

The sturdy shipping containers have travelled the world in their previous incarnation, but now will be firmly on dry land as a permanent local landmark.

The Amin Library has a collection of 6,000 books that local residents can read for free in the colourful new building.

Landmark: The building has become a popular attraction in the small town of Batu in Indonesia

Imaginative: The Indonesian library has been constructed from 7 pieces of shipping container

Literacy: The women's reading room  is a place to relax and chat with a magazine of book overlooking the trees

Overlooking treetops and local houses, the seven different sized containers serve as focused areas of learning.

The blue room is for popular reading and entertainment books. 

The yellow space is the women's reading room, and the red room for science and technology. 

The public library was designed by Indonesian firm, dpavilion architects, which specialises in recreating adventurous vessels for other purposes.

Learning zones: The red room is for science and technology books, with a sheltered gallery for outdoor reading below

Popular: Young people have particularly keen to make use of the free 6,000 books on offer

The sophisticated facility is hoping to provide a better quality of living for locals in the agricultural town of Batu, who in general have little money.

The widening gap between those who have money in Indonesia and those who do not was the impetus for the playful project, which is totally free to the public. 

Inside is also a health clinic that 
provides villagers with health care.

Designer library: Despite looking sophisticated and modern, the building was low cost because shipping containers are cheap and easily available in Indonesia

The centre is composed of five shipping containers hoisted up on top of stilts.

The containers' third floor offers views of the city, the surrounding treetops, and beyond.

Shipping containers are very accessible in Indonesia and easy to manoeuvre meaning that the sophisticated, comfortable building cost relatively little to make.

Unique: The cutting-edge library has given the people of Batu a comfortable meeting place to read and learn

Innovative: The comfortable library is hoping to promote literacy in the small agricultural town
