Shocking video footage of the moment a federal ranger shot dead a man on a lonely Nevada desert highway has been dubbed 'redneck justice'.

Two horrified men watched in their car on Friday as the unsettling scene unfolded near the Red Rock Canyon Conservation area as a Bureau of Land Management ranger shot and killed D’Andre Berghardt Jr., 20.

Giving a running commentary to their cellphone footage, the men exclaim, 'Oh my God, they just shot him' as the observe an unarmed Berghardt refuse to yield to officers and attempting to flee the scene - only to be killed as more than eight rounds are emptied into him.

Put your hands up: The two men who filmed the shocking episode initially stopped and saw D'Andre Berghardt being held at gunpoint on  state Route 159 near Calico Basin, Nevada

The video, obtained by the Las Vegas Review Journal is shot from a car parked on the road while the rangers deal with Berghardt.

He had been hailing cyclists as he walked along state Route 159 near Calico Basin, more than 20 miles from Las Vegas.

Two cyclists reported the man and rangers responded.

Refusing to obey officers holding him at gunpoint, the two men began to film as the situation quickly became farcical.

Indeed, several minutes into the stand-off, one ranger pepper sprays Berghardt, causing the 20-year-old to stumble and grab his face.

However, the rangers do not seem in the video to attempt to cuff him.

'It’s really interesting that they haven’t just kind of grabbed him. I guess they really want him to be compliant before they (arrest him),' says the man filming.

The other man replies, 'Yeah, it doesn’t look like he’s being very erratic. They should have just grabbed him.'

Uncooperative: D'Andre Berghardt has still not complied with the rangers and one of them kicks out at him - but fails to follow it up with a cuffing

Following this, Berghardt rips off his shirt and turns his back on the officers and then suddenly is kicked in the back of the knee.

Berghardt responds by throwing a punch at which point a Nevada Highway Patrol trooper arrives as he dashes behind a truck and out of the camera’s view.

The video resumes with two rangers on top of Berghardt and the trooper standing to one side. At no point does it seem they attempt to cuff him.

However, unruly Berghardt manages to escape their grasp and makes towards the trooper's patrol vehicle.

'Why don’t they just cuff him and be done with it?' one of the men in the video asks.

'You’d think,' the other replies. 'They keep letting him get up and run away.'

Events take a tragic turn as Berghardt opens the door to the trooper's SUV and and climbs inside while the trooper closes the door on him.

'Dude, this guy’s going to end up getting shot,' one says as suddenly one of the rangers opens fire and appears to fire eight or nine shots inside the car.

'Dude, they just shot him. They just killed the dude. Holy (expletive). They just killed him.

'You know what’s ridiculous about this is, they never grabbed him. They could have grabbed him. They kept letting him get up.'

Fleeing: D'Andre Berghardt makes to run away and is seen trying to get inside the troopers SUV

Law enforcement in Nevada have not commented on the case - however, the Las Vegas Review Journal reports that authorities claim Berghardt was attempting to grab the trooper's AR-15.

Indeed, one of the men in the car does acknowledge the risk the officers were taking allowing the man to be in the SUV.

'They had him on the ground,' the other says. 'I don’t know why they didn’t just jump on him and pin him!

'You know, unless they thought he had something on him, but it didn’t look like it to me.

'It’s redneck justice.'

Trooper Loy Hixson, a Highway Patrol spokesman, said Friday the officers 'felt their lives were in danger.'

David Reed, 61, said he was in a truck close to the action and spoke to the Las Vegas Review Journal.

Shots: More than eight shots can he heard ringing out as a ranger fires into the trooper's SUV after D'Andre Berghardt had managed to get inside

'They tried and tried,' he said. 'I thought he was on drugs or something. He was that strong; he was throwing them around.'

Berghardt is reported to have left his home in California to come to Las Vegas after an argument with his mother.

Highway patrol officials have not yet responded to messages.

The Clark County coroner said Mr Berghardt died of multiple gunshot wounds. The death was ruled a homicide.

Bicyclists and joggers told reporters that Mr Berghardt had been seen walking on the paved shoulder of the highway with a rolling suitcase, a backpack and a bedroll.
