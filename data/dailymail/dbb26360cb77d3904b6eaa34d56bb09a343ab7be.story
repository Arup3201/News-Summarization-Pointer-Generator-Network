Settle back into a cosy chair and switch on the TV at 5.30pm tonight for a nine-hour knitting extravaganza.

Norway is live streaming the prime-time hobby show in their attempt to air more sedate programs for their audience and British viewers will be able to tune in too.

In an attempt to beat the world 'sheep to sweater' record, a team of Norwegian knitters will shear a ewe on live TV before spinning its wool and knitting a jumper in the shortest possible time. 

Knitting: Norway is live-streaming a nine-hour program on knitting with a four-hour segment solely on the hobby and a world record attempt

The previous record, held by Australia, is four hours and 51 minutes.

Viewers can build up to the thrilling challenge by watching four hours of knitting know how before the record attempt.

'We'll just broadcast as long as they keep going. It should be a hit.' Rune Møklebust, head of programming at Norwegian public service broadcaster NRK said.

This latest easy-watching TV program is the latest in the Norwegian concept of 'Slow TV' which was launched in 2009 when NRK showed the view from the roof of a seven-hour train ride from Bergen to Oslo, the Telegraph reports.

'It was the 100th anniversary of this route and we'd planned a couple of documentaries,' says Mr Møklebust. 'Then someone said, "why not film the whole trip?" We thought it would be something completely new … and cheap.'

Although he initially thought it was a good idea, Mr Møklebust did have second thoughts while it was being aired as it was on a Friday night and up against stiff competition like the X Factor and the Norwegian version of Have I Got News For You. 

But the mundane programming proved a hit.

He explained: 'Miraculously, we got more viewers. All these people wrote in to say, "I only meant to tune in for a minute but I watched for hours."'

Inspired by this success, Mr Møklebust subsequently positioned 11 cameras on the side of a cruise ship and broadcast the views throughout a five-and-a-half day journey along the Norwegian coast in 2011.

The show attracted 3.2 million viewers and a 36 per cent share of Norway's TV viewing market. Since then, the channel has shown a 24-hour salmon fishing special, a 12-hour show about a fire being built and lit, and a 379-hour boat trip.

Arve Hjelseth, a Sociologist from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, said: 'We're increasingly urban dwellers, so the mountains, fjords and coastline remind many Norwegians of where they come from. We're more stressed these days, too, so it's a time to relax as well as an antidote to modern TV, where camera angles shift every second. So called "Slow-TV" is strangely calming.'

British viewers can watch from 5.30pm GMT time on nrk.no.
