A 100ft letter E has been created in an East Sussex forest as a a permanent tribute to Queen Elizabeth II and the Jubilee year of 2012.

Royal fans volunteered with manpower and machinery in order to cut hundreds of trees on the hillside to make the design in honour of the Queen.

Despite torrential rain and gale force winds, the team are nearly finished clearing the overgrown trees in South Downs near Lewes, East Sussex.

The project is the brainchild of local farmer Carola Godman Irvine to honour the regent's time on the throne.

She said: 'It has been a real 
community effort and it wouldn't have been possible if it wasn't for the
generosity of a number of local businesses.

'They said they wanted to help out so 
they could tell their children and grandchildren in years to come that 
they were part of it.'

She added: 'We have been working through gale force wind and torrential rain but we are just about there.

'We just need to clear some of the felled wood and we are done.'

Teamwork: The project is done entirely through volunteers with help from local firms in Lewes, East Sussex who provided the machinery

Hard work: Despite 'gale force winds and torrential rain' the team are determined to finish their tribute to Queen Elizabeth II

Satellite imaging was used to plot the
E and permission was granted by Natural England and the south Downs 
National Park Authority.

The project received no funding and 
relied on volunteers to clear the woodland and local companies to lend 
machinery to help them.

Phil Belden, director of operations 
for the South Downs National Park said: 'Fewer than five per cent of the
South Downs National Park remains as chalk grassland so work to clear 
scrub with follow-up grazing to conserve and enhance this precious 
landscape is good news.'

David Allam the High Sheriff of East 
Sussex said: 'It is hard to exaggerate the effort and determination that
Carola has used to bring about this lasting tribute to the Jubilee.

'Without her vision and hours of 
simple hard work by a group of her friends and farming contacts this 
unique project would never have been considered as achievable.'

A large V was created in the nearby village of Streat in 1897 to mark the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria.
