Had a bad night's sleep? Well try sleeping naked on a bed of iron wire for 36 days.

That's what Chinese female artist Zhou Jie has been doing for her art project, '36 Days'. She hasn't revealed why she is doing it, but crowds of Beijing art goers have been flocking to the Art Now Gallery to watch her 'perform'.

The exhibition, which began on August 9, will see the artist continue sleeping on an iron wire bed until September 13. In front of exhibition visitors, Zhou Jie will be doing daily activities like, eating, washing, using the bathroom and playing on her mobile. 

The art project has attracted attention on an online Chinese publication, with locals questioning its artistic value.

One viewer commented on website chinaSMACK: 'Look at Korean performance art, then look at domestic ones. Is art in our country only streaking [nudity]? No wonder women in our country have a lower and lower sense of shame, all a result of these garbage artists streaking [going nude] everyday!'

'So this is a so-called artist, very unreliable,' another viewer wrote.

Zhou Jie will continue to spend her time on a iron wired bed, with 'plush toys' weaved from iron wire.
