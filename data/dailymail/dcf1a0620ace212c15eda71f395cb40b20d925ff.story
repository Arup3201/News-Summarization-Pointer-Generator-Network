Former England international Matt Stevens is set for a Twickenham return after being named in the Barbarians squad to tackle Australia next month.

Prop Stevens, who won 44 caps before retiring from Test rugby in 2012, is one of seven South Africa-based forwards called up by Barbarians coach John Kirwan for the Killik Cup clash.

Stevens, 32, now plays for the Durban-based Sharks after leaving Saracens earlier this year.

Stevens looks on during his side Saracens clash with Harlequins last season while he is tackled by Barbarians Neemia Tialata during a match at Twickenham Stadium in May 2012.

He is joined in the Baa-baas squad by his fellow latest call-ups CJ van der Linde, Coenie Oosthuizen, Heinrich Brussow, Thomas Du Toit, Michael Rhodes and Jacques Botes.

'I've always wanted to play for the Barbarians - it's one of the brilliant traditions of the game,' Stevens said.

'I am back at Twickenham as well, so there will definitely be a bit of nostalgia for me. It is a fantastic place.

'The last time I played there was in the Aviva Premiership final (on May 31), and it was a nice way to finish even though it was tough to have lost my last game on English soil.'

More than 50,000 tickets have already been sold for the Australia game on November 1.
