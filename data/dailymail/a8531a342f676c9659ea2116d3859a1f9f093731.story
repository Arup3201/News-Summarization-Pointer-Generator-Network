Smiling again: Jodie Hart underwent surgery to fix her underbite

When Jodie Hart first noticed her lower jaw jutted out further than her upper jaw, during her early teens, she assumed the problem would correct itself. Instead, the mismatch only became more pronounced.

Within a few years her underbite – where the lower jaw is further forward than the top – was so severe that chewing food  was difficult.

‘I already had orthodontic braces to correct my crooked teeth and I hoped they’d fix my underbite,’ says Jodie, 26, who works in PR.

‘But my lower jaw gradually got more prominent and unsightly, and by the time I was 17 it was really uncomfortable.

‘Eating was hard as my teeth didn’t 
fit together properly. I didn’t eat apples because it was too much 
effort trying to bite into them and I had to get food  to the back of my
 throat and chew it much more. I also felt really self-conscious as my 
jaw looked odd.’

An 
underbite is a type of deformity known medically as a reverse overjet. 
It is caused by an overgrowth of the lower jaw or the upper jaw not 
developing properly,  or a combination of the two.

‘Jaw
 deformities are quite common and affect about ten per cent of the 
population,’ explains  Darryl Coombes, consultant oral and maxillofacial
 surgeon at the Queen Victoria Hospital in East Grinstead, West Sussex.

‘An
 underbite can sometimes cause jaw-joint problems, such as pain or 
clicking, and patients find it hard to bite into foods.

'There’s often 
also a psychological impact too as it can appear strange and alter 
looks.’

An underbite can 
occasionally be corrected with orthodontic braces alone but if the 
deformity is severe – as in Jodie’s case – surgery is needed to 
reposition and realign the jaws.

This
 is performed by surgeons qualified in both medicine and dentistry, and 
only on patients aged over 18 whose bones have stopped growing.

‘Jaw surgery is a major undertaking and the entire process takes about 18 months’ says Mr Coombes.

‘People with an underbite often have rotated or angled teeth, caused by the mouth adapting, and these must be completely straightened and aligned before the operation by an orthodontist. Otherwise it’s impossible to work out where the jaws should be and teeth won’t fit together correctly.’

Patients wear braces for a year – and they remain on during the procedure.

Once the teeth are straight, the surgeon takes X-rays of the jaw and makes a cast of the teeth, and uses a metal hinge known as an articulator to simulate how the teeth should meet.

‘Once the correct position is determined, plastic wafers are made to sit on the teeth during the operation and show where the jaw should be,’ says Mr Coombes. ‘A great deal of planning happens before the surgery.’

The operation is performed under general anaesthetic and through the mouth, via incisions in the gums, to prevent scarring to the face.

‘To move the upper jaw, we break and 
detach it from the base of the skull, then reposition it,’ says Mr 
Coombes. ‘To move the lower jaw, we cut the sides of the jaw using a 
surgical saw.’

The jaw can then be slid forwards or backwards until it is in the correct position – marked by the wafers.

It
 is fixed together again with titanium plates and screws, then the gums 
are sewn up with dissolving stitches. Titanium is used because it  is 
bio-compatible, so it can stay in  for life.

Jodie had four screws inserted and had a thin slice of bone removed from her jaw, to improve the fit. Surgery usually takes two to three hours and requires a short stay in hospital.

‘Afterwards patients experience swelling, numbness and discomfort for several weeks,’ says Mr Coombes.

‘Painkillers are prescribed and patients see their final appearance two to three months later. Braces stay on for up to six months.’

Jodie’s recovery from the NHS surgery took about five weeks.

‘After the operation the pain was extreme, despite the painkillers, and there was a lot of blood in my mouth,’ she says.

‘My jaw was locked shut, due to the pain, and my cheeks were like footballs.

'The first few days I was kept on a drip, then I started drinking nutrient shakes through a straw. After a few weeks I moved on to soft foods then later back on to solids.

‘Although my bottom lip and part  of my chin are now numb, which  doctors warned could happen, I haven’t had any pain since.

'The ordeal was definitely worth it – I am now able to chew food comfortably, can eat what I like and I breathe more easily.

‘Once the swelling had completely gone, I had a normal-looking face and was thrilled. It was like looking at a different person in the mirror.

‘Now I feel much more confident about my appearance, whereas before there was a major imperfection.

‘My face is all in proportion and the new jaw position even makes my cheekbones more pronounced.

‘Having the surgery was the best decision I’ve ever made.’
