Authorities near Pittsburgh have arrested an 18-year-old man who admitted to the brutal rape a nun in the parking lot behind the church where she serves Friday morning.

The suspect, Andrew Bullock, faces at least 10 charges in the viscous attack.

According to authorities, the victim was walking in the parking lot behind the Titus Church on Franklin Avenue in Aliquippa - about 20 miles northwest of Pittsburgh - when the suspect approached her and asked if she needed help.

The nun, 70, told the young man that she was fine and started to walk away, at which point the suspect told her to look down at his exposed genitals.

When she continued to walk away, authorities say Bullock grabbed her neck and began to choke and punch the woman.

'The first thing you notice when you look up up where this horrific act occurred, is the statue of the Virgin Mary looking down,' Assistant Chief Dan Couch told KDKA.

The brutality of the crime, Couch says, shocked and outraged many officers in his department.

According to authorities, a boot print found in the snow matches the boots Bullock was wearing at the time of his arrest.
