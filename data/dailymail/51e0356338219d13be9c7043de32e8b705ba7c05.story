A 12-year-old boy's mother and stepmother assaulted two of his female classmates after he said they were bullying him, police have said.

The mother, Teri Johnson, 29, and stepmother, Inez Hernandez, 33, drove to Cooper Academy in Fresno, California last week and allegedly attacked the girls, aged 12 and 13, in the school's cafeteria while around 100 people looked on.

They targeted the girls after the boy pointed out the alleged bullies, police told KFSN.

The women said that they had first gone to school officials to stop the ongoing bullying, police said.

'They said nothing was being done,' Fresno Police Lt. Joe Gomez said. 'That's their allegation.'

No one was injured in the March 17 incident.

But the women were arrested on suspicion of felony conspiracy and misdemeanor cruelty to a child. 

The boy's 15-year-old sister was also arrested for allegedly assaulting an official who was attempting to break up the fight by pushing her, Gomez said.

Even the 12-year-old boy was arrested on a conspiracy charges for allegedly initiating the fight. 

'He wasn't involved in the fight, but clearly he pointed out the two teenagers that were allegedly causing him problems,' Gomez said.

The Fresno Unified School District issued a statement to KFSN saying it is investigating the incident to determine possible disciplinary action.

'Fresno Unified School District takes these incidents very seriously,' it said. 'The safety and security of our students and staff is our top priority.

'We applaud the efforts of the school's safety and security team that prevented the matter from escalating further and the Fresno Police Department for investigating and arresting suspects in connection with the incident.'
