An off-duty police officer shot dead while tackling a psychotic gunman has been named the bravest officer in England and Wales.

Pc Ian Dibell, 41, was hit at point blank range as he tried to stop Peter Reeve, 64, gunning down his neighbours.

Just minutes earlier the paranoid gunman fired seven times at his neighbour and his girlfriend in the communal hallway of their home.

The Essex officer’s self-sacrifice was honoured at the Police Bravery Awards, organised by the Police Federation of England and Wales.

Prime Minister David Cameron and Home Secretary Theresa May joined dozens of police officers at the annual event in Central London.

Among them were frontline officers who tackled armed robbers, rescued people from burning buildings and dived in freezing water to save drowning children.

Mr Cameron said it is ‘humbling’ to read the extraordinary acts of heroism undertaken by officers in the line of duty.

‘Every single day, around our country, the police put themselves in harm’s way to keep us safe,’ he said.

‘Without the rule of law, there is no freedom worth its name – and it is right that we recognise the work of those who do so much to uphold it.’

‘Britain’s police are the best in the world, ordinary men and women who do extraordinary things.’

The awards come during a tense week 
for relations between the police and the Government amid further 
fall-out from ‘Plebgate’ Andrew Mitchell affair.

Mr Cameron said his Tory party
colleague, who rowed with officers at the gates of Downing Street 
deserves an apology over his treatment by three senior police 
representatives.

Pc Dibell was killed in an extraordinary confrontation a short distance from his home in Clacton, Essex, in July last year.

The
officer walked out of his home to see Reeve chasing his neighbour in 
his car while firing a pistol at him through the windscreen.

Grabbing his warrant card to put himself on duty, Pc Dibell ran towards the car and dived through the driver’s side window.

Witnesses
described hearing a loud bang before the officer fell to the road, 
clutching his chest. He died at the scene from his injuries.

Reeve then ran over his neighbour – who escaped with minor injuries – and crashed his car before travelling to a village graveyard where he turned the gun on himself.

Mrs May said: ‘Ian Dibell’s death is a reminder not just of the bravery police officers show on a daily basis, but also the depth of their commitment to public service.

‘Pc Dibell was off-duty when he stepped in to help a neighbour in distress. He could have walked away, but he chose to put himself in harm’s way.

‘His bravery, and that shown by thousands of his colleagues up and down the country, is yet another reminder that we have the best police officers in the world.’

Steve Williams, who leads the Police Federation, said:  ‘For every act of courage and bravery recognised here today there are hundreds more that occur in our communities every day that go unrecognised.

‘Officers put others’ lives before their own.  Sadly, as our winner’s story highlights, this can have tragic consequences.

‘Pc Ian Dibell was a valiant team player, his bravery on that fateful day typifies his whole life – always putting others before himself.’
