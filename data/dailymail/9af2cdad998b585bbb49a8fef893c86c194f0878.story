It isn't just the clothes designers who create the new trends at fashion week.

Behind the scenes, the most talented hair and make-up artists in the world work like a well-oiled machine to set the next season's beauty trends - and if they have anything to do with it, we'll be wearing face tattoos, panda-esque eyeshadow and monobrows come autumn.

Behind the scenes in New York, London, Milan and Paris, the hotbed of talent have been busy conjuring up AW15's beauty looks and it's time to get your glitter at the ready and throw out your tweezers.

Models in Paris at the Atsuro Tayama show rocked monobrows, so will Cara Delevingne - and the rest of the world - be growing theirs out for next season?

Cara Delevingne set the trend for bushy brows and it seems the look is bigger than ever (quite literally).

Models in Paris at the Atsuro Tayama show rocked monobrows, which were created using brown eyeshadow blended through their brows and eyelids.

The trend for overdoing the eyeshadow was also present in Milan at Antonio Marras' show where Tom Pecheux shunned the go-to wide winged shape for eyes.

Instead of creating a subtle sheen on the lids, he buffed layers and layers of rusty red shadow into a circle shape around the upper and lower eye, making models look panda-like.

At MSGM, lids were glossy and make-up artist Lisa Butler shunned shadow for eye gloss to give models a fresher look.

Elsewhere, legendary beauty guru Val Garland used tattoos as an extension of her make-up at the Giamba show.

Inspired by Cara Delevingne and Kate Moss, who both have fun little tattoos, Val and her team painted intricate designs, such as hearts, moons and stars, onto the girls' faces, hands and fingers.

Young French designer Jacquemus also got creative and sketched a Picasso face onto the side of his models' faces.

As for hair, Atsuro Tayama was setting trends with his kinked quiffs, which were created by Wella's Eugene Souleiman. 

Gel was used to slick down sides, then Eugene  coiled models' hair into a tight spiralled twist, which he removed just before they hit the runway leaving them full of texture. 

Gel came in abundance at Just Cavalli, where  James Pecis created a 'wet, humid, swampy look' by wetting models' hair and webbing hair it over their faces.

These quirky beauty trends come after beauty teams in London created their own looks on British soil.

Portuguese designers Marta Marques and Paulo Almeida for Marques' Almeida sent models down their runway with white eyelashes, while Val Garland decorated models' eyes with sequins.

At Matthew Williamson, Benefit's Lisa Potter-Dixon created a new take on eyeliner being dubbed 'displaced liner,' by applying a sweep on the models' sockets rather than on their waterline.

Sophia Webster, always one to push quirky trends, asked Sharon Dowsett fom L'Oreal Paris to completely coat some of the models' faces in glitter.

Elsewhere, other models were given totally white faces with a bold glitter lip.
