Karl Lagerfeld celebrated the global success of Chanel in an incredible Paris Fashion Week where models walked around an enormous globe under the glass roof of the Grand 
Palais exhibition hall.

Dotting the sphere were 300 Chanel flags representing each of the fashion house's boutiques around the world. Creative director Lagerfeld said 'the spirit of the show was Chanel's globalisation'. They've expanded around the world since the first boutique was opened in the Normandy seaside town of Deauville by the legendary Coco Chanel a century ago.

But the show was surely also a celebration of the German-born designer. He celebrates three decades at the creative helm this year, during which he's overseen the transformation of the house into a truly global empire.

Out of this world: The models orbited a globe in the middle of the stage under the glass roof of the Grand Palais exhibition hall

Wintry: Hints of pink, purple and metallics featured in the predominantly black and grey collection

'I can be very happy. When I started we had three or four (boutiques) 30 years ago,' said Lagerfeld. 'But it's not an ego trip.''

The show's 79 varied looks brimmed with ideas, classic and new, and showed that the designer is still a creative force to be reckoned with.

Models, including Cara Delevingne and Stella Tennant, walked around the circular globe runway sporting stylish new winter concepts in tones of predominantly black, blue and grey with splashes of pink, purple and metallics.

Biker chic: Thigh-high boots with chains, choker necklaces and black gloves featured in the Paris Fashion Week show

Wrapped up: The furry hats came in pastel colours to contrast the dark coats and suits

Modern twist: Re-workings of the classic Little Black Dress that Coco Chanel was famous for

21st century update: Other classic Chanel touches were present including jackets with frayed seams and tweed suits while zip up leather leg sheaths - starting at the thigh and ending at the ankle - were a new invention

Accompanied by classical music that morphed into Daft Punk's 'Around the
World' the models showcased the Autumn/Winter 13/14 collection which includes 'peek-a-boo' coats with folded back sleeves and hems.

Biker chic was also prevalent with chained over the knee boots, black gloves and furry helmet style hats. Numerous models also wore zip up leather leg sheaths - like leggings that start at the thigh and end at the ankle.

Modern re-workings of some of Chanel's classic looks including the LBD and skirt-suits ensured the core clientele weren't left behind.

The models' hair was kept simple and loose, at times chain choker necklaces were worn over long locks, while the make-up included glittery silver eyeliner.

Ready for winter: Black and greys with hints of colour were seen on the runway

Celeb support: Milla Jovovich, left, and Jessica Chastain sat on the front row and met creative designer Karl Lagerfeld after the show

A-listers on the front row included Oscar nominated actress Jessica Chastain and model-turned actress Milla Jovovich.

Milla praised Lagerfeld's wintry collection. 'It's romantic. I loved the coats. It's early 20th-century Coco, but he's made it uber-modern,' she said.

Despite turning 80 this year, Lagerfeld, who took a turn orbiting the globe at the end of the show, said he has no plans to slow down and hopes to continue Chanel's global expansion.

'Look,' he said pointing at an empty part of the globe. 'There is still space left.'Â
