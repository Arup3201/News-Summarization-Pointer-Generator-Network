A wild giant panda has been spotted adhering to all the correct pedestrian rules as it walked a zebra crossing in south-west China.

Giant pandas are usually only captured on wildlife cameras situated in remote bamboo forests, but this one was caught on CCTV as it crossed the road.

The panda was captured by traffic monitors in Yingxiu township in  Sichuan province as it made its way across the quiet lane 

Why did the panda: The wild giant panda bear was caught on CCTV as it crossed a road in south-west China

Out for a walk: The footage shows the rare bear correctly crossing the lane in Yingxiu township, Sichuan

Night-time stroll: The panda is believed to have left its natural forest habitat due to hunger or may have been forced by man-made activity or been scared by dogs

'They almost never go into urban areas and prefer the safety of their forest habitat, so it's really unusual to catch one in town like this,' Yong Chen, panda expert at a breeding centre told local news.

'It looks pretty healthy as well, but as it's winter it was probably hungry and looking for something extra to eat.'

He said the panda appears to be approximately two-years-old and in good health.

Other experts however suggested that the panda may have been forced to leave its natural habitat either because of some man-made activity or possibly stray dogs, as food alone would not tempt it into town. 

The visit by the bear sparked a flood of panda-watchers to Yingxiu township, however there has been no second sighting of the  rare animal which appears to have returned to its regular habitat.

Proper panda: The panda could be seen checking for traffic before crossing the road

Young un: An expert said the panda appears to be approximately two-years-old and in good health

Gone in 60 seconds: Although panda-spotters have flocked to the area, the bear has not made a second appearance in the township
