Stoke City talisman Bojan Krkic is out of his side's New Years' Day clash against Manchester United.

The in-form forward went off with a suspected hamstring injury in the victory against West Brom on Sunday.

Sportsmail understands that Bojan underwent medical tests on Tuesday afternoon and they have revealed minimal damage to an interior muscle between the hamstring and groin.

Bojan will miss Stoke's Premier League clash against Manchester United on New Year's Day 

The 24-year-old is also expected to miss Stoke's third round FA Cup clash against Wrexham

However, the lunchtime visit of United to the Britannia Stadium comes too soon and the former Barcelona star is expected to be out for around a week. 

He will also sit out the FA Cup match against Wrexham on Sunday.

Bojan has scored three Premier League goals since joining Stoke in the summer. 

Stoke manager Mark Hughes will be unable to call on the services of Bojan for his side's next two matches
