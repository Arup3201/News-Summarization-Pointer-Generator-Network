A new mansion for one of the world's richest tycoons has ruffled the feathers of a wealthy neighbour - who complained it would ruin his right to shoot game.

Billionaire H&M owner Stefan Persson won permission last month to build a nine-bed manor on his 780-acre estate in Wiltshire with a swimming pool, tea house, walled gardens and an orangery.

But the decision to uproot a clump of 'monotonous' poplar trees prompted a row with millionaire Harry Hyams, who has lived on the nearby Ramsbury Manor Estate for a reputed 50 years.

The 87-year-old property developer behind London's Centre Point tower block warned the scheme was in 'direct conflict' with 'sporting rights' he has over the land.

According to the Sunday Times, Mr Hyams said the poplars provide 'winter holding cover' for pheasants. Shooting rights can also include partridge, deer or pigeons.

The trees were due to be uprooted and replaced to improve the look of the area of outstanding natural beauty - but it is thought the process could disturb game birds and drive them away from their habitat. 

Mr Hyams contacted solicitors and sent a formal complaint via a planning agent, who wrote: 'Mr Hyams has sporting rights over the whole of the application site and all of its surrounding lands.

'I must enforce the fact that Mr Hyams' sporting rights are an enforceable legal profit a prendre... and are owned in perpetuity.

'These major landscape works... would be in direct conflict with his sporting rights, severely compromising the exercise of these sporting rights in full'.

In the end Hyams' argument did not prevent the H&M tycoon's house, near the leafy village of Ramsbury, from being built.

Council officers said the shooting rights were nothing to do with them - so the two tycoons would have to fight it out between themselves.

And they pointed out that replanting a better mix of woodland trees could actually improve the environment for game birds in the long run.

Mr Persson's agent said: 'The poplar plantations have a uniform and monotonous appearance which is entirely alien to the locality.

'The uniformity of appearance extends to the understorey which is managed by frequent cutting.

'In some parts of the plantation, the poplar trees are dying, or at best are showing signs of stress and decline – making them vulnerable to wind-throw and storm damage.'

The Swedish chairman of fashion chain H&M owns almost 9,000 acres of land in Wiltshire and is ranked as the world's 24th-richest man by Forbes.

The 67-year-old's new mansion will be joined by two bungalows and employ six full-time staff, with parking spaces for 12 cars.

Although Mr Persson is a director of the UK-based Ramsbury Estates Limited, the application itself has been made through a firm based in Luxembourg.

His wealthy neighbour was not the only person to object.

One occupier of a bungalow due to be demolished for the plan complained she taught piano there and it would lead to a loss of income.

'[She said] has not been offered suitable alternative accommodation by the landlord that is either of an adequate size or in a suitable location for her singing and piano teaching business to continue', a report said.

Mr Hyams, meanwhile, has lived in the luxurious Ramsbury Manor for five decades after making his fortune as a property developer in the 1960s.

He was one of the key figures behind London's Centre Point, a well-recognised 35-storey tower in the heart of the West End which famously stood empty for more than a decade after it was built.

He was ranked 303rd in last year's Sunday Times Rich List, which estimated his wealth at £312million.

His stately home was once the target of Britain's biggest ever burglary on a private property in 2006, when a gang of thieves made off with antiques and art worth £30million.

Ringleader Daniel O'Loughlin, 35, was jailed for 11 years in 2008 for his role in the heist.
