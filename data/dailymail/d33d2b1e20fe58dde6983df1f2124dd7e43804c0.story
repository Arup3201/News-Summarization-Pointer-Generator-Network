The beds are made up, but this abandoned mansion has not had an occupant sleeping in its grand rooms for years,

The tenants at the Round Mansion in western Belgium are long gone, but the bedrooms are still occupied by expensive furniture and ornaments.

These eerie photographs were captured by London urban explorer Andre Govia, 37, after he decided to start documenting his love of abandoned buildings.

Spooky: With an abandoned tricycle sitting in an empty corridor, this derelict but once grand mansion could be the setting for The Shining

Silence: Piles of clothes lie abandoned on a chair in one of the many bedrooms alongside papers and even a wine glass

Past: The bedrooms looks like the occupants have just left, but tell-tale signs of decay and dust suggest another story

'This mansion was an amazing place to visit,' said Mr Govia.

'It was very cold and creepy, heavy damp air and noises from the wind made it seem so chilling.

'The most interesting part for me was the sheer size of the mansion.

'I couldn't believe the nine bedrooms and large rooms were used by just the one family who lived here.'

Mr Govia explains: 'When people see these photographs they think that it's a waste of a building and history. I like this reaction as I always try to capture the ambiance and textures of the location so people can feel what it's like inside'

 like this reaction as I always try to capture the ambiance and textures
 of the location so people can feel what it's like inside.

'I try to create images that will place people with me on my visits and see what I feel and see.

'This particular building made me feel on edge and so there was no time to relax when I was inside.'
