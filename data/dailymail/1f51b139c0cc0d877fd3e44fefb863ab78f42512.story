Survivor: Melissa Goduti, pictured, escaped from the Costa Concordia with her 55-year-old mother

A Connecticut woman, one of thousands of terrified passengers trying to flee a sinking cruise ship off the coast of Italy survived the horror with only the clothes on her back. And she says she was one of the lucky ones.

Melissa Goduti, 28, of Wallingford, Connecticut had boarded the ship only three hours before with her 55-year-old mother Maria Goduti when they said they felt a massive jolt.

‘All of a sudden, the boat leaned over on a 70-degree angle and everything just started falling, dishes were falling, trash cans were falling, everything was falling,’ Ms Goduti told the Hartford Courant by telephone.

‘Then the lights went out and everything was blacked out and then the lights back on.’

She said the short, traumatic voyage on the Costa Concordia was meant to celebrate her birthday. 'Everything I have is in that ship,' said Ms Goduti, listing her cell phone, passport and camera memory cards.

Also left behind were the Rosary beads she and her mother purchased at the Vatican before boarding the Concordia in the Italian port of Civitavecchia on Friday.

'I will never go on a boat again,' she 
said. 'We didn't even get to see Italy, nor do we know how we're going 
to get home,’ she told the Connecticut Post.

After the initial impact, which left a 160-foot gash in the boat's hull, she and her 
mother spent the next moments struggling to find a crew member who 
could explain what was happening and direct them to a lifeboat.

The crew kept reassuring them that nothing was wrong and that the boat simply struck a large wave.

No one the mother and daughter ran 
into spoke English, and there were no evacuation instructions inside 
their cabins.

They eventually found an Australian couple. The four of them then found an area equipped with life jackets 
and at least two life boats.

Only
 hours before, the mother and daughter were joking about not having an 
evacuation drill until the next day, despite the fact that some 
passengers had been on board for several days at that point.

‘I joked with my mother, what if something happened today, what (sic) have no idea where we’d have to go,’ she told the Courant.

Meanwhile, their worried father and ex-husband watched helplessly from their home in Wallingford. David Goduti told the Courant that he felt helpless throughout the whole ordeal as he saw reports of the sinking ship.

‘It just rips your heart out is what it does,’ Mr Goduti said. ‘You don’t know what to think when they’re in another country and there’s nothing you can do to help.’

Once Ms Goduti and her mother found a lifeboat, they waited on deck for more than an hour as the ship continued to tilt at a more extreme angle. Ms Goduti said she felt lucky to be on the side of the ship closest to the water.

Ms Goduti said the situation on the ship’s other side was a completely different story. ‘I could hear people jumping off the boat and into the water,’ she said. ‘I’m kind of like numb to it because I think I don’t even realise it actually really happened yet.’

The terrifying, chaotic escape from the luxury liner was straight out of a scene from ‘Titanic’ for many of the 4,000-plus passengers and crew.

At least six people are confirmed dead and 16 are still missing.

But late on Saturday, nearly 24 hours after the accident, a South Korean couple on their honeymoon were rescued.

Also on the vessel was retired accountant Brian Page, 63, who had paid $1,300 for a seven-day cruise. He was enjoying a seven-course silver service dinner when disaster struck.

He said: 'Soon everything was going everywhere – glasses, plates and cutlery. I was having to grip the table to stop it sliding away. The whole ship was rocking violently from side to side.'

Speaking of the panic on board, he said: 'People were screaming. Women and children were not getting priority at all.'

He added: 'I have lost everything including my passport. I only have the clothes I am wearing.'
