Even grizzly bears let the catch of the day slip through their claws every now and again.

These spectacular photographs capture the moment a huge brown bear struggled to get his paws on some fast food as he hunted salmon.

The hungry grizzlies showed off their fishing skills just inches from the camera after descending on the river in Ni'iinlii'njik Territorial Park in Yukon, Canada.

Photojournalist, Peter Mather, had set up his equipment level with the waterline to capture the salmon desperate attempts to swimming away whilst the bear, above water, eyes it up.

One underwater shot even shows a fish moments before a bear feasts on it.

Mr Mather spent ten days at Bear Cave Mountain camp in the park so he could get up close and personal with the bears to take pictures of them.

The 39-year-old, who lives in Yukon, was lead by guide Phil Timpany whilst on the trip.

'Fifteen hundred miles upriver from the Pacific Ocean and sitting dead centre on the arctic circle is the most unusual of ecological reserves,' he said.

'Surrounded by tundra and stunted black spruce forest you'll find the Fishing Branch Territorial Park.

'It's an arctic oasis where trees grow three or four times higher than the surrounding ecosystems and where grizzly bears and salmon play out a life-cycle thousands of years old.

'I spent 10 days at Bear Cave Mountain Eco-Adventures camp with guide Phil Timpany.

'To get to the lodge and park, I had to drive 500 kilometres north of Whitehorse to Dawson City, Yukon.

'From there it was a two hour helicopter ride North to the Lodge which is located on the Arctic Circle. It is one of the remotest locations in North America.

'To get the close-ups that I got I used a remote camera set up in an underwater housing.

'In the morning, I'd go down to the river with Phil and set my camera. Many of the bears were exceptional fishermen.

When one came near the camera, I'd be about 25 feet away at a viewing platform, and I'd use my remote to take pictures.

'Some of the bears were great at catching fish, and some had little luck.

'Some would charge into the river fast and pounce on them. One bear would snorkel through the deep water and catch them and others would walk the shoreline above the river and jump down on the fish.

'Normally, the bears would come down to the river for an hour and catch half a dozen fish, then they would go into the forest to nap for three hours and return to fish when they woke up.

'It was a once in a lifetime experience to be so close to these giant bears. We would be on viewing platforms not 10 feet away, and the bears would ignore us.

'It was quite a beautiful experience and special to be able to interact so closely with the bears in a very safe situation. It was definitely more exciting than scary.

'Often I'd put my camera down and just watch in amazement as these grizzlies finished off salmon right in front of you.'

The bears would spend around an hour-and-a-half catching the salmon before heading back to the forest for a nap 

Mr Mather said some of the bears were great fishermen, but others were not so skilled
