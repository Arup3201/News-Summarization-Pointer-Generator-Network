More than a million workers got a pay rise today – after the minimum wage was increased by 19p £6.50 an hour.

It means those on the lowest legal wage are set to see their pay rise by as much as £355 a year.

Today’s pay rise it the first real terms cash increase since 2008, following recommendations from the Low Pay Commission which sets the rate.

More than a millions workers will today see their pay increase by 19p to £6.50 an hour - a £355 boost over the year

It comes amid growing political concern over Britain’s army of low-paid workers with both Labour and the Tories setting out plans to increase low wages.

Ed Miliband last week promised to increase the minimum wage to £8 an hour by 2019. Chancellor George Osborne said he wanted the legal minimum to increase to £7.

The number of people on the National Minimum Wage has doubled since it was introduced 15 years ago and is now the pay rate for one in 20 workers, according to the think-tank the Resolution Foundation.

Around 1.2 million employees earn the legal minimum wage compared with just over 600,000 in 1999.

A further 1.3m workers are clustered close to the minimum wage - earning within 50p of the minimum level. It means one in ten workers are poorly paid.

Despite the 3 per cent increase today, years of below-inflation increases mean it really worth the same level as it was in 2005.

The minimum wage level was also increased for workers under 21 and apprentices.

Those aged between 18 and 20 can no longer be paid less than £.5.13 – an increase from £5.03.

Business Secretary Vince Cable has called for the minimum wage to increased at a faster rate 

The minimum wage level for 16 and 17-year-olds, meanwhile, has increased from £3.72 to £3.79 per hour, while the apprentice rate is up 5p to £2.73 per hour.

Business Secretary Vince Cable said: ‘The National Minimum Wage provides a vital safety net for the lowest paid, ensuring they get a fair wage whilst not costing jobs. This year’s rise will mean that they will enjoy the biggest cash increase in their take home pay since the banking crisis, benefiting over one million people in total.

‘I believe it is vital that the Low Pay Commission’s recommendations - not political considerations - should set national minimum wage rates.

‘As signs of a stronger economy start to emerge, we need to do more to make sure that the benefits of growth are shared fairly across the board. The Low Pay Commission will continue to advise Government on future wage rises and ensure the minimum wage keeps pace with inflation’.

Earlier this year the Business Secretary asked the low pay commission to look at ways to increase the minimum wage more quickly than it has done previously.

Chuka Umunna, Labour’s Shadow Business Secretary, said today’s wage increase was ‘welcome’ but said: ‘We must go further.’

Mr Umunna said: ‘Labour has announced plans which will see a minimum wage of £8 in the next Parliament by setting a more ambitious target to ensure a fair day’s pay, alongside tougher enforcement action.

‘The Tory-led government has failed to match our plans to make work pay again and boost living standards. And to add insult to injury, George Osborne misled working people by claiming he wanted to see a £7 minimum wage then failing to deliver or set out plans for reaching this figure.’
