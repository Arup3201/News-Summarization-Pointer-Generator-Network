San Francisco 49ers player Chris Borland, a leading rookie last season, is retiring from the NFL at age 24 over health concerns related to repeated head trauma, ESPN and the team said on Monday.

ESPN reported he was retiring over health concerns related to head trauma, an issue that has rattled the league and prompted a massive lawsuit against the NFL.   

'I just honestly want to do what's best for my health,' Borland told ESPN's Outside the Lines. 'From what I've researched and what I've experienced, I don't think it's worth the risk.'

He continued: 'I just want to live a long, healthy life, and I don't want to have any neurological diseases or die younger than I would otherwise.'

San Francisco 49ers linebacker Chris Borland is retiring from the NFL over health concerns related to repeated head trauma

Borland, who played college football at University of Wisconsin, played just one year in the NFL with the 49ers

The 49ers did not specify in its statement why Borland chose to leave after just one season. 

'From speaking with Chris, it was evident that he had put a great deal of thought into this decision. He was a consummate professional from day one,' 49ers general manager Trent Baalke said in a statement. 'While unexpected, we certainly respect Chris' decision.' 

Borland, a linebacker, was a star in his only season with the team, registering 108 tackles, a quarterback sack and two interceptions, and earned several rookie of the week and rookie of the month honors. 

An ankle injury in December ended his season.

He has had two prior concussions and said he notified the 49ers of his decision on Friday, which the team confirmed.

Borland, who had two concussions prior to retirement, made his announcement on Friday. 'I just honestly want to do what's best for my health,' he told ESPN's Outside the Lines program

The third-round NFL Draft choice said he was being 'proactive' despite feeling 'as sharp as I've ever been.'

'I'm concerned that if you wait till you have symptoms, it's too late,' Borland said. 'There are a lot of unknowns. I can't claim that X will happen.'

He becomes the most prominent NFL player to turn his back on a rich contract, a four-year deal worth just under $3million in Borland's case, over concerns about brain injuries. 

The announcement comes as an unexpected blow to the 49ers, who have already had a difficult off-season and also saw standout linebacker Patrick Willis retire last week. 

Many sports reporters and commentators went to Twitter to express their thoughts about Borland's retirement. 

Tim Kawakami from the San Jose Mercury News Tweeted that he found the culture of football - and the lifestyle that comes with it - to be changing

His Tweet suggests that Borland's decision could mean putting him at the forefront of changing the perspectives of football

NFL.com's Michael Silver suggested that people should take a step back from what Borland's retirement means for the 49ers and look at what it means for football as a whole

San Jose Mercury News's Tim Kawakami and NFL.com's Michael Silver highlighted what Borland's retirement meant for the larger sport of football.  

'I used to think that 99% of players wouldn't be able to pull themselves away from this-- the game, the fame, the lifestyle. But...' Kawakami wrote. 'But the perspective is changing. Chris Borland just put himself at the forefront of that, and he obviously did it with a lot of thought.'

'I understand the compulsion of 49ers fans to see this through team-centric eyes, but Borland's decision is bigger than that, obviously,' Silver wrote. 

Monday Morning Quarterback's Andrew Brandt mentioned that this announcement might allow other players to be more open about concussions.

Sports Illustrated writer Doug Farrar suggested that Junior Seau's suicide may have played a role in Borland's Decision

'Borland news may not lead to more players retiring early but may lead to less players inclined to hide and play through the head trauma,' Brandt wrote. 

Sports Illustrated writer Doug Farrar suggested that Junior Seau's suicide may have played a role in Borland's Decision.

'Looking at the number of early retirees in the NFL this month, You'd better believe the Junior Seau story has a lot of people thinking,' Farrar wrote.  

A class-action lawsuit involving thousands of former players, filed in 2012, contended that the league hid the dangers of brain injury among players while profiting from the sport's violent physical contact.

There have been suicides in recent years by former NFL players, including Jovan Belcher, Junior Seau, Ray Easterling and Dave Duerson.

In February, a U.S. judge refused to accept a proposed settlement between the NFL and the players, saying payment should be expanded for some players and families among other concerns.
