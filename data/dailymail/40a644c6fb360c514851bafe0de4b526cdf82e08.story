The mother of a three-month-old boy who died after his father left him in a hot car for an hour while he allegedly smoked marijuana with a co-worker has bravely spoken out for the first time.

Heartbroken Rebecca Hillary expressed her love for her baby Jamison, tragically killed after his father Daniel Gray, 31, locked him in the car in 100F heat on Wednesday.

Gray faced court on Friday charged with 
manslaughter and child abuse, as co-workers revealed they saw him smoking pot with a new employee inside the restaurant's cooler while Jamison baked in the car outside.

'He was a very happy boy. He was always such a good boy. He 
loved to smile. He just loved to smile, and play and bounce.'

Hillary also thanked people who donated money for her son's funeral. He was born on May 28.

Meanwhile, Gray had his initial court appearance on Friday, according to CBS 5.

'Do I get to say anything,' Gray asked the judge at the conclusion of the hearing.

The judge responded: 'Not at this time. I've appointed an attorney to represent you. The microphone records everything you say.'

At the time of Jamison's death, Gray told police he was simply checking in at B.T. Sports Pub in Scottsdale, Arizona, where he works as a kitchen manager, and lost track of time.

However according to a police report, a kitchen employee said they saw Gray smoking marijuana in the cooler with a new employee.

A witness later saw Gray and the new employee standing in front of Gray's car with the baby inside and assumed they were smoking marijuana again.

Gray was arrested at his north Phoenix apartment on Thursday.

Mourning: According to a blog post by Jamison's aunt, the boy's mother Rebecca Hillary took time off work to mourn her son's tragic death
