Bringing in the old: Chris Moyles has seen the average age of listeners of his Radio 1 breakfast show rise to 33

It is supposed to be the radio station for the nation's youth.

But the age of the average Radio 1 listener is actually 32, according to research, up from 29 three years ago.

And the audience for the breakfast show presented by 37-year-old Chris Moyles is even older, at an average age of 33.

The BBC station infamously lost long-running presenters including Simon Bates and Dave Lee Travis in the 1990s to try to become 'trendy' again. Its target audience now is 15- to 29-year-olds.

Yet the station has almost 2.5million listeners aged 45 and over, according to the analysis from commercial rival GMG Radio, owner of Smooth Radio.

Moyles has seen his 15- to 24-year-old audience fall by 7 per cent in three years while his 45- to 54-year-old listenership has increased 23 per cent to 854,000, according to GMG Radio.

Radio 1 had an average weekly reach of 11.85million listeners in the three months to September 18, according to official Rajar figures.

This was its highest quarterly listening figures since 1999.

But Moyles lost more than 250,000 listeners on the previous quarter, down to 7.16million.

The analysis comes despite repeated calls by the BBC Trust for Radio 1 executives to refocus the station towards a younger audience.

It also represents a dilemma for new controller Ben Cooper, who took over last month following the exit of long-standing chief Andy Parfitt in the summer.

GMG Radio chief executive Stuart Taylor said: 'My message to Ben Cooper would be: You have got the job, now bring the station into line. What are you going to do to meet the trust's clear instructions?'

In 2009, the station was told in a BBC Trust review to refocus its schedule on winning more younger listeners.

At the time, it was also reported that Radio 1 executives privately believed some of their DJs were too old.

The concerns were repeated in the 
BBC's annual report this year, in which the Trust said it would 
'continue to challenge [BBC management] to ensure that Radio 1 focuses 
more clearly on younger listeners'.

Mr
Taylor said: 'Why not redesign Radio 1 around 15 to 29-year-olds? If 
you started again from scratch you wouldn't have what they do now.'

A
BBC spokesman said: 'Radio 1's young audience has actually increased 
and now reaches 3.7million 15- to 24-year-olds. Share of listening among
this age group has also risen and the station now reaches 45 per cent 
of all 15- to 24-year-olds in the UK.

'Radio 1 and 1Xtra both have a strong 
editorial strategy for continuing the focus on attracting a younger 
audience.

'This includes programming like Radio 1's Teen Awards, Radio 
1's Big Conversation, 1Xtra under 18s night and the Radio 1 Student 
tour.'

Despite Radio 1's ageing audience, the average listener to its sister station Radio 2 is still significantly older.

The average age of a Radio 2 listener is 51, as it has been for more than five years.
