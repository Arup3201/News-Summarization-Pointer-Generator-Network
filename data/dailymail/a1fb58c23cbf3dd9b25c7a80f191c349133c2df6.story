Miss Mayes had just started studying for a degree to become a Primary School teacher

A trainee teacher died in her sleep from a rare heart condition aged only 19 despite appearing to have no health problems.

A coroner described Charlotte Mayes as the ‘perfect daughter’, as she did not smoke, drank little alcohol and was anti-drugs.

She had returned from travelling in Turkey with her best friend only days before being found lifeless on the sofa by her brother Ian.

He called 999 and desperately tried to resuscitate her but it was too late.

In the year before her death, the only signs of a potential problem were bouts of lethargy.

Her mother Michelle Roberts told an inquest: ‘She had been really, really tired, so she slept lots.

‘I did tell her to go to the doctor, but she didn’t.

‘As soon as she came home, she would sleep on the sofa.’

Mrs Roberts, who remarried after Charlotte’s father Ian died in 1994, was on holiday in Egypt with her husband Paul when Charlotte died last September.

‘I returned home and was told that she had died a few hours earlier,’  she told coroner Alan Walsh at the  hearing in Bolton.

Her friend Nikita Lee said Charlotte, known as Lottie, had been ‘sleeping lots, especially near the end of the holiday’, added Mrs Roberts, of Hindley, near Wigan.

She said: 'She had been really, really tired, so she slept lots. I 
did tell her to go to the doctors, but she didn't. As soon as she came 
home, she would sleep on the sofa.

'We
 hadn't seen her - Charlotte was due back three days after we left for 
Egypt. She was still in Turkey and had been there since June. She went 
away with her friend Nikita. She did say about her sleeping lots, 
especially near the end of the holiday.

'I was really ill in Egypt that morning, as if I knew something bad had happened.'

Deputy Coroner Walsh continued, 
reading from Mrs Robert's statement: 'And your daughter didn't smoke, 
she was very anti-drugs and she was a light drinker. She was a perfect 
daughter.'

Her daughter had begun a degree in education at Liverpool Hope University five days before her death.

She had hoped to become a 
primary school teacher.

Mr Walsh said: ‘She was, in every sense, a perfect daughter.’

He added that she would have been ‘a perfect example’ to her future pupils.

The court 
heard Charlotte's brother Ian, had returned to the family address around
 5.30am and Charlotte was still awake on the sofa.

Charlotte had been suffering from bouts of tiredness but had not gone to a doctor despite her mother's urging

His
 statement read: 'When I went inside, Charlotte was sat up in the living
 room. She was watching television and the lap top was turned on.'

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a condition where the heart muscle becomes thickened.

Around one in 5,000 people have the condition, and it most commonly develops during the teenage years or young adulthood.

However,
 the symptoms vary depending on the severity. These include shortness of
 breath, chest pain, palpitations, dizziness and fainting attacks - most
 commonly during exercise.

It
 can cause the heart muscle to become stiff, which means your left 
ventricle doesn't fill as easily as normal and less blood is then pumped
 out.

It can also partially obstruct blood flow, which can make small blood clots more likely.

In
 some people, the abnormal heart muscle affects the electrical 
conducting system of the heart. This may cause abnormal heart rates and 
rhythms to develop.

Sudden 
collapse and death occurs in a small number of people with HCM. This is 
probably due to a severe arrhythmia which may develop suddenly

Most cases are hereditary so screening of close family members is advised.

Ian woke up at 12.30pm and went into check on his sister, but she wasn't in her bed.

'She
 was lying on the sofa. I could tell she wasn't breathing and her skin was
 a different colour. I phoned my brother then I called an ambulance. 
They told me to carry out CPR but I knew it was too late.'

Charlotte
 was declared dead at 12.46pm that day. Dr Trisha Wahie, who carried out
 the post mortem examination, sent Charlotte's heart 
to pathologist Dr Suvarna, because she could not see any abnormalities 
with the naked eye. It was confirmed the promising teen had died from a 
heart condition - hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

In evidence, Dr Wahie sad it was very possible she had died peacefully in her sleep.

She
 added: 'It may be a spontaneous mutation or run within families. They 
can have no symptoms at all. This would have been a sudden, unexpected 
death without any great suffering.'

Recording a verdict of death by 
natural causes Mr Walsh said: 'This is a very sad and tragic death due 
to natural causes. Charlotte was on the verge of studying to fulfil her 
ambition of becoming a teacher.

'She
 was, in every sense, a perfect daughter. She didn't smoke, she drank 
little and she engaged with her family. She was someone who you would be
 proud to call your daughter.

'Although
 she had suffered from tiredness, I'm sure it didn't stop her enjoying 
herself in Turkey. At least, in that final stage she would have enjoyed 
her final time with her friend in Turkey.

'She
 was obviously a very well-liked person who intended to become a 
teacher. I believe that those children she would have taught will sadly 
miss the benefits of her knowledge and the benefits of her personality.

'She would have been a perfect example for those children.'

The
 hearing was told since Charlotte's death, family members have been 
scanned for heart abnormalities, but they have had no irregular results.

In
 a message on Facebook her friend Nikita said: 'I lost one of the most 
important things you will have in life and that was my best friend, the 
one who all my memories are with, she was the most beautiful, sweetest,
 fun, crazy, kind, forgiving, inspirational, cheerful girl you could 
ever meet.

'I love you so much Charlotte and I will never ever, ever, forget you, you are always in my heart. Sleep tight little princess.'
