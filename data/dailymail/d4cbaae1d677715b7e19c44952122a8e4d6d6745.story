Queens Park Rangers striker Loic Remy has trained for the first time since the collapse of his proposed move to Liverpool. 

The France international had been primed to complete a permanent switch away from Loftus Road before he failed a medical. 

Remy, who impressed while on loan at Newcastle last season, even travelled to America to finalise a deal with the Reds.

But after that fell through, he was back training with Harry Redknapp's side over in Ireland and could play in the friendly against Athlone Town on Tuesday. 

It is a significant about-turn for the 27-year-old after his manager appeared to be planning for life without the striker. 

Redknapp has gone on record saying he is willing to accept Remy back into his squad - even after the player searched for a move away - but did query Liverpool's decision to pull the plug on spending £8.5million.

Injury problems have blighted the former Marseille man's career but, when fit, his pedigree in front of goal is unquestioned. 

Alan Pardew and Newcastle were heavily indebted to Remy last season after he scored 14 goals in 26 Premier League appearances while on loan and the manager did want to re-sign him. 

For now he is a QPR player, with the club's first game back in the top flight against Hull City on August 16 and having Remy in their midst will offer a boost in a quest for survival.
