Three out of four voters will never vote for the Liberal Democrats and Nick Clegg has given up trying to win them over, party aides admitted yesterday.

But senior figures revealed that the Deputy Prime Minister will try to use his party conference, which starts today, to distance the Lib Dems from their Coalition partners.

While the party’s own surveys show just 10 per cent of voters will back the Lib Dems in the 2015 election, only another 15 per cent would even consider backing them. ‘That’s our market and we are concentrating on them,’ a senior figure said.

On the rocks? Nick Clegg is expected to distance himself from David Cameron at the Lib Dem party conference

The dire prognosis comes as a Lib Dem minister today warns that the party is courting electoral disaster by disowning Government policies.

Home Office Minister Jeremy Browne is expected to tell senior colleagues such as Vince Cable and Tim Farron that they cannot be ‘half in, half out’ of the Coalition.

He said his party would ‘lapse into the opposition comfort zone’ if it started echoing Labour criticisms.

Mr Clegg will also take on Lib Dem Left-wingers and tell them they should be proud of their achievements in Government, particularly getting the economy back on track.

But allies of the leader last night revealed that Mr Clegg and his top team will also use the conference to ‘lift the veil’ on disagreements with the Tories.

Asked whether Mr Clegg would ‘tell the Lefties to suck it up or pour a bucket of s*** over the Tories’, the source said: ‘Both.

'Our message is that you can’t trust Labour to build a stronger economy and you can’t trust the Tories alone to build a fairer society.’

But Mr Browne, a close ally of Mr Clegg, said: ‘If Liberal Democrats run down the achievements of this Government, we will not deserve to share in the credit for the Government’s achievements.’

Further splits occurred in Lib Dem ranks last night when Mr Clegg warned that distancing the party from the Tories on the economy makes ‘no sense’, while Business Secretary Mr Cable demanded a rise in the minimum wage and attacked plans to boost the housing market.

He said: ‘The idea that you can grow an economy on the back of rising house prices is a very, very dangerous argument.’
