For the past few weeks, she has broken with tradition by declining to accept flowers from crowds at Sandringham.

But the Queen appears to have had a change of heart after she stopped to collect bouquets from children outside St Peter's Church in Wolferton today.

Wearing a pale apricot coat and matching hat, Her Majesty looked delighted as she chatted to well-wishers and accepted the floral gifts.

Service: She looked delighted as she chatted to well-wishers and accepted the floral gifts following the service

The 87-year-old Monarch had braved the cold and rain to attend Sunday morning service at the church, which is situated on the royal Sandringham estate in Norfolk. 

She was accompanied by a large party, including the Duke of Edinburgh, her private secretary Sir Christopher Geidt and former defence minister Nicholas Soames.

But the Queen didn't let the weather dampen her spirits as she joyfully accepted flowers from waiting youngsters following the service.

A palace spokesman told MailOnline she had been 'delighted' and 'grateful' to receive the bouquets.

It comes just two weeks after Her 
Majesty broke with tradition for a second time by declining to accept 
flowers from children as she left morning service at St Mary Magdalene Church on January 5.

A crowd of around 250 - including a girl in a wheelchair - had hoped they would be able to tempt the Queen with the floral gifts, but were told by police officers that she would not be accepting them.

Her Majesty, who had previously declined to accept flowers on December 29, instead came straight out of church and was 
driven away in her maroon Bentley, accompanied by her cousin Lady Mary 
Colman.

Disappointing: Hundreds of people - including a young boy (left) and a girl in a wheelchair (right) - had been hoping to tempt the Queen with the floral gifts, but were told by police she would not be accepting them

Some children left their
 bouquets in a pile outside the 13th century church, which were later 
taken to Sandringham House by police officers.

Meanwhile, others were forced to hand their flowers to the Queen's guests, who were 
walking the 600m back to the House with Prince Philip

Yesterday, The Mail on Sunday revealed that the Prince of Wales is preparing to take control of the Royal Family media operation within weeks.

For the past 20 years, the Queen and her heir have operated separate press offices from Buckingham Palace and Clarence House respectively.

However, they will now be run from one office at the Palace, with Prince Charles’s head of communications, Sally Osman, at the helm. 

One Royal confidante told the paper: ‘This is the first step to bringing Charles to the throne.’
