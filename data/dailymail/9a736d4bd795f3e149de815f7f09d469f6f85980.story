A mother who was bludgeoned to death and stuffed inside a suitcase in Bali was paid $800,000 in a lawsuit settlement three years ago.

Court records show that Sheila von Wiese-Mack and her late husband received the settlement in a lawsuit between the couple and Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.  

Around $500,000 of the money went to her husband's estate and was designated for their daughter through an earlier will.

But in 2011, a judge allowed Ms von Weise-Mack to pay herself the $500,000 as the estate's 'sole beneficiary', meaning the money did not go to her daughter and suspected killer, Heather Mack.

It is not clear if the settlement with Royal Caribbean Cruises affected the relationship between von Wiese-Mack and her daughter, the Chicago Sun-Times reported.

Mack, 19, and her boyfriend, Tommy Schaefer, 21, are suspected of murder.

In Indonesia, naming a suspect is a formal part of the criminal process before they are officially charged.

Officials say future charges could include premeditated murder, which carries a maximum sentence of death by firing squad.

The American couple also had a disagreement with Ms von Weise-Mack, 62, over who was paying for their hotel rooms, police say.

Bali police chief Major General Benny Mokalu said officers had interviewed 19 witnesses, of which some said they overhead a disagreement between the three over who should pay for their accommodation.

Chicago police records also show that officers were called 86 times in 10 years to the house where Ms von Wiese-Mack and her daughter once lived.

The records indicated that Ms von Wiese-Mack was repeatedly and violently abused by her daughter.

However Mr Mokalu said a motive for the crime had not been established.

Ms von Weise-Mack's body was found stuffed inside a suitcase in the back of the trunk of taxi outside a hotel in Bali.

Police say she was bludgeoned to death with an ashtray and a vase, which both smashed after impacts with her head.

The bloodstained shards of glass have fingerprints on them but detectives have not revealed whether they belong to Mack or Schaefer. 

The FBI have been drafted in to help Indonesian police with their investigations. 

An Indonesian lawyer appointed to the couple, Haposan Sihombing, said that the suspects were being held under a suicide watch and were still refusing to talk to investigators.

Their American attorney, Michael Elkin, said that Mack, 19, is two months pregnant and complained about her treatment in custody.

Mack claims that her pregnancy is ectopic and that it is vital she returns home to the U.S. for care.

She was seen being taken to the obstetrics and gynecology section of a police hospital in Bali for tests on Friday to find out if her pregnancy is 'outside the womb', a dangerous condition. Police have not revealed the results of any tests.

Ms Von Wiese-Mack's body was found last week inside a suitcase in the trunk of a taxi in front of a five-star Bali hotel.

The couple was arrested the next day at a hotel about six miles away.

They told police that Ms von Wiese-Mack was killed by robbers, while they managed to escape. 

Ms Von Wiese-Mack was the widow of  jazz and classical composer James L. Mack, who died in 2006 at the age of 76.
