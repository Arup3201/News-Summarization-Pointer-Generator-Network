The chihuahua may be one of the smallest dog breeds but its appetite for destruction is larger than any other, a study has revealed.

Over its lifetime, the tiny terrors will cause an average of £865 worth of damage by ripping or staining carpets, scratching or chewing sofas and digging up plants and flowerbeds.

In contrast, Staffordshire Bull Terriers, which are perceived as fierce by many people, make the best pets as they cause the least amount of damage, costing around £178 in total.

The ‘sausage’ dog or Dachshund also has a bad reputation with insurers and is the second most destructive dog according to the survey, with owners facing a bill of £810 to clean up their pet’s destruction, followed by the boxer with total damage of £784.

‘Chihuahuas may be tiny but it seems they will leave you with a bigger bill than any other dog,’ a spokesman for Sussex-based financial comparison site PayingTooMuch.com, said.

‘They might not have the size of other breeds but they can still leave more than their fair share of destruction behind them.

‘All pet owners expect a little damage from their dog from time to time, but when you add up the total amount spent on cleaning, repairing and replacing, it can be a huge amount.

‘Add to that extra costs from damage caused to other people’s property and bills if your pet is involved in an accident, and you can expect to part with a large amount of money.’

The study of 2,000 dog owners found that the Dalmatian, Bulldog, Great Dane, Husky, Beagle, Pointer and German Shepherd make up the rest of the top 10 most destructive dogs.

Staffordshire Bull Terriers cause the least damage and were followed by West Highland Terriers which cause around £183 worth of destruction over their lives.

Third place went to Yorkshire Terriers with a bill of £227 followed by a Spaniel’s £230 and Whippet’s £251.

Some people may be surprised that Rottweilers and active Sheepdogs are among the least destructive dogs.

Researchers found that 57 per cent of dog owners will face a trail of destruction in their home at some point over their pet’s life, with scratched, ripped or chewed carpets the most likely damage.

But it doesn’t stop in the home as 13 per cent even admitted their pet has caused damage to someone else’s property, with seven in ten then facing an average repair bill of £285 for that as well.

More than one in five also admitted their pet has been involved in an accident, leaving them with a vet’s bill of a further £274.

While owners love their pets, they are temporarily less affectionate when being hit with a large bill, with one in five admitting they have regretted getting their pet, with one in 10 considering giving them away.

‘When it comes to a pet, many owners turn a blind eye to the real costs involved because they are seen as being part of the family and are viewed with a loving eye,’ the spokesman said.

‘However as our research shows, the cost of owning a dog will usually exceed providing food, paying vets bills and buying toys as there will be other ancillary costs which should never be under-estimated for all sorts of reasons.’

Millions of besotted cat owners are so keen to stay in touch with  their pets that they use their mobile phone or computer to call home and ‘speak’ to them.  

One in three use video messaging service Skype to see and give them attention, a poll of 1,000 owners claims.

Almost a quarter of men admit they’ll even call home just to hear their feline friend purring.

Ignoring the fact that cats only offer affection on their terms, half of British owners say they’d rather spend time with one than with a human.

When owners and pets do spend quality time together it’s clear what they get up to. For 37 per cent of men say they have taught their cat to perform tricks, the poll for card retailer Hallmark shows.

So it’s no surprise that 29 per cent of women say their cat is a fully-fledged member of the family.
