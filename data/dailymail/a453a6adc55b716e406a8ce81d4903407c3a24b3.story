Red Bull design guru Adrian Newey has criticised the 'restrictive' nature of the Formula One regulations which have played their part in his decision to take a back-seat role this season.

Red Bull's chief technical officer will shift his focus away from grand prix racing to helping Sir Ben Ainslie design a yacht to challenge for the America's Cup.

Whilst still involved with Red Bull, Newey will be less hands on than in the past, primarily as he feels F1 has become an engine formula at present, offering him little scope to make a difference.

'You can always improve, but the problem is the limitation of the regulations, so much so the car is designed for you,' said Newey.

'Formula One should be a blend of the driver, chassis and engine, but the current regulations have swung too much in favour of the engine, combined with a very restrictive set of regulations on the chassis.

'As the engine manufacturer has the benefit, it's difficult for the chassis manufacturer to make enough of a difference to overturn that.'

In Red Bull's case they saw their four successive years of title-winning success ended in crushing fashion by Mercedes last season.

Mercedes won 16 of the 19 grands prix, with Red Bull claiming the other three via Daniel Ricciardo, which was a triumph in itself given power-unit supplier Renault's woes in pre-season.

Renault, though, have conceded they were 10 per cent down on power last term compared to Mercedes, highlighting just how far they were on the backfoot.

Concessions have been made for this season that will allow the power units to be developed via the use of a complicated token system.

It at least allows Renault and Ferrari the opportunity to cut into Mercedes' advantage, although Newey feels the latter will still be way out in front.

'Renault have done a very good job of developing the engine over the winter, but you don't overcome a 10 per cent deficit in a few months and that is the position we're in,' added Newey.

'We're better than last year but still considerably down on where Mercedes were, which is not taking into account any findings they've had over the winter.

'Mercedes clearly are the favourites, they have a very good team and a great power unit.'
