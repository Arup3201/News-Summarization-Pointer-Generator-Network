A British man was killed after a drunk driver ran him over just one day into a holiday in Dubai.

Gavin Duffy, 29, was visiting a friend in the United Arab Emirates when he was run over on Saturday following a night out.

The man's family from Billingham, Teeside, have received £17,000 in donations from the British public to repatriate his body after launching an appeal.

The marathon-runner hadn't bought travel insurance before going to visit friend, Craig Boyle, who has lived in Dubai for ten months.

The pair were crossing Al Sufouh Road in Dubai Marina at around 1.30am when the quantity surveyor was hit. Witnesses recall how the driver did not stop after the collision but was remanded two hours later as he tried to flee the country at Dubai International Airport.

A Brazilian man, 31, confessed to traffic prosecution officers to have been driving under the influence of alcohol at the time of the incident. He is awaiting trial.

Mr Duffy's father, Michael, has spoken out to thank all those who contributed to having his son's body brought home.

The family, who originally appealed for £5,000, have said they will donate the remainder of the money raised to a hospice.

'We are very grateful to Gavin's friends and family. 

The 60-year-old told the Sun: 'We've been overwhelmed by their generosity,comfort and sympathy.

'We knew Gavin was well liked, but didn't know how much until this.'
