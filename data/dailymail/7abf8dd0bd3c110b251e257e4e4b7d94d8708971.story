Paul Scholes has slammed Louis van Gaal for reacting to Sam Allardyce's 'long-ball United' comments  - labelling the Dutchman's outburst 'bizarre'.

The former England midfielder believes Van Gaal, as manager of Manchester United, should have ignored the West Ham manager's comments, which were made following the 1-1 draw at Upton Park on Sunday.  

The 63-year-old turned up for his press conference ahead of United's game against Burnley on Wednesday with a four-page dossier, which he insisted dispelled the claims made by Allardyce.

The statistics quoted in the A4 pamphlet, which were put together by Van Gaal's analysts, claim West Ham sent a higher percentage of their long passes forward than United during the match.

The exact figures showed 71.1 per cent of West Ham's 'long passes' - of over 25 metres - went forward whereas United's percentage was just 49.9 per cent.

However, Scholes, speaking on the Fletch & Sav show following Liverpool's win over Tottenham on Tuesday night, said there was no need for the United manager to react.  

He said: 'Why would you react to a West Ham manager, it’s different if it’s a rival manager like Chelsea or Manchester City's, but at the end of the day you're the Manchester United manager.

'I found it all bizarre to be honest with you, as I felt Allardyce's comments were light-hearted in the first place.'

West Ham boss Allardyce labelled Louis van Gaal's side 'long-ball United' following Sunday's 1-1 draw

Van Gaal was clearly annoyed at Allardyce's comments and he had the pamphlet on his desk waiting when he fielded the first question about the West Ham manager's jibe

The former Barcelona boss insisted his team only started launching balls forward after 6ft 4in Marouane Fellaini came on in the 76th minute of the draw against West Ham

Scholes later went on to question Van Gaal's decision to deploy Rooney in midfield rather than as a striker this season, as well as expressing his disappointment at the level of United's performances.

He added: ‘It’s not great to watch - put it that way. I've heard Van Gaal say recently that United can't take risks, but what message does that send to the fans?

'It’s all about taking risks as a Manchester United player and having the balls and tenacity to go out and attack the opposition. 

West Ham made just 11 of their 32 'long and forward' passes during the match, according to boss Van Gaal 

Van Gaal claims United made 49.9 per cent of 'long passes forward' in comparison to West Ham's 71 per cent

Van Gaal freely admits that Man United played more long balls when Fellaini was introduced

When a colleague of mine is saying this kind of thing then, yeah, you have to see the data and you have to put the data in the right context I believe.

I think the media is also coming to the match and you have a lot of opinion about me, or the game, or the players and now you say that you have no opinion. 

When you have 0 per cent ball possession do you think that you can do that with long balls? Yeah, long balls, in the width, to switch the play. You have to look at the data and then you will see that we did play long balls, but long balls wide, rather than to the striker.  A ball to the forward striker is mainly caused by long-ball play. 

Because I expected this question, I have made an interpretation of the data for this game and then I have to say that it is not a good interpretation from Big Sam. 

It is not so difficult also to read that. I am sorry, but we are playing ball possession play and after 70 minutes we did not succeed, in spite of many chances in the second half, then I changed my playing style. 

Then, of course, with the quality of Fellaini we played more forward balls and we scored from that, so I think it was a very good decision of the manager. 

But, when you see overall the long ball, and what is the percentage of that, then West Ham have played 71 per cent of the long balls to the forwards and we 49. 

So, I give you this and you can see that the blue ones are the good ones because long balls are also very difficult, which is why I began with the explanation of ball possession. 

When you have 60 per cent ball possession you cannot play long balls. So again, they did it 71 and we 49, and I give it you, you can copy it and then maybe you can go to Big Sam and he will get a good interpretation. 

'They're (the fans) used to watching United teams that play high intensity football and score plenty of goals - and that just hasn't happened this season.

‘The two centre forwards - whoever has been playing up there in different games this season - have not been good enough either.

‘He (Rooney) scores goals, creates them and gives endless amounts of energy - this is Wayne Rooney - how many goals has he scored for Manchester United and England?

'He's wasted in midfield or on the wing, he's got to be playing upfront.'
