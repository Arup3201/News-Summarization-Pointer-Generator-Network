Goalline technology will also feature for the first time when the game hits the shelves in the UK on September 26 on Xbox One and PlayStation 4.

Broadcast Graphics – Broadcast quality overlay graphics that are synonymous with the international TV broadcasts will communicate to fans all the important game information: team sheets, formations, score and clock, next fixture, player stats, and more.

Audio and Commentary – The ambience and cheers of over 20 Barclays Premier League matches were recorded and implemented into FIFA 15 to bring realistic audio to goals, misses, whistles, and crowd-specific chants. The Barclays Premier League Anthem will also play at the start of each League match up.

All 20 Stadiums – Every stadium in the Barclays Premier League is in the game and looks, feels, and sounds just as it does in real life, including authentic representation of animated LEDs and advertising boards.

Authentic Player Headscans – Using the latest 3D scanning technology, the FIFA 15 development team visited every Barclays Premier League club in the 2013/14 season to scan players and capture their likeness. Over 200 new player heads will be scanned into FIFA 15, giving them the most realistic player model possible.

Goal Decision System – Making its debut in FIFA 15, Goal Decision System will leave no question as to whether or not the ball crossed the line. Replay animations will emulate TV broadcasts playing after close calls and goal line clearances.

'EA SPORTS is a long term licensee of the Premier League and we are extremely pleased to extend our existing agreements with them,' he said

'They have worked with our clubs to enhance the Premier League element of FIFA 15 like never before and they continue to engage with football fans in a variety of innovative and exciting ways.'

EA Sports chief operating officer Peter Moore added: 'It brings our award-winning game to new levels of authenticity and realism, and enables fans to immerse themselves in the drama
