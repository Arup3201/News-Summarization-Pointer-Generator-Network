Traffic flowed again Monday on the Golden Gate Bridge, after a weekend closure to install a safety barrier designed to reduce dangers of head-on crashes.

The bridge reopened at 9:30 p.m. Sunday, more than six hours ahead of schedule, said Priya Clemens, a spokeswoman for the Golden Gate Bridge Highway and Transportation District. 

For the longest period in its nearly 80-year history, the bridge was closed early Saturday to all but pedestrians, cyclists and buses to install the barriers on the 1.7-mile-long bridge. 

Previously, only yellow plastic tubes offered protection from opposing traffic. 

Since 1970, there have been 128 head-on collisions on the bridge - resulting in 16 deaths, according to Clemens.

Bridge officials said early Monday that traffic was moving over the bridge with no problems.

A survivor of a 2008 head-on crash on the bridge spoke earlier Sunday from her wheelchair to help inaugurate the new barrier, made of steel-clad concrete blocks that can move across the span's six lanes to accommodate traffic demands.

Dr. Grace Dammann, who pushed for a safer median barrier since becoming paralyzed from the crash, said she decided to drive in the 'suicide lane' because she and her daughter were running late. Brian Clark, who was driving in the opposite direction, had just learned his father had terminal cancer.

'He passed out at the wheel, crossed over and hit my car,' Dammann recalled.

She said she and Clark became friends as they urged the district to approve the $30 million barrier.

'I am so grateful,' said Dammann, who came to the ribbon-cutting ceremony with Clark. 'Brian and I thank you.'

The suspension bridge opened in 1937, and previously has closed only for shorter periods, including for celebrations and work projects. 

Ahead of her speech, Damman told The New York Times  'Life turns on a dime. And if we can make it a gentler landing for people, that’s good. That’s my prayer.'

The bridge's closing caused problems for some weddings and birthday parties, as well as businesses, the newspaper reported. 

'Having this barrier here — you hate to say never — but it prevents head-on collisions,' bridge manager Kary Witt told SFGate ahead of the ribbon-cutting completed by Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco). 

The website explained that the 'suicide lane' is the lane closest to the left, and that Zipper Trucks will shuffle the barrier around as needed.

The barrier measures 11,500 feet in length and features 3,517 pieces, SFGate reported.

Rep. Speier (D-San Mateo) was quoted by the website as saying  'You can’t prevent all automobile accidents, but you can prevent head-on automobile accidents and serious injuries and deaths on the Golden Gate Bridge. This barrier is really about public health.'

Fixed: For the longest period in its nearly 80-year history, the bridge was closed early Saturday to all but pedestrians, cyclists and buses to install the barriers on the 1.7-mile-long bridge

Altered: The suspension bridge, whose toll plaza is seen on Saturday, opened in 1937, and previously has closed only for shorter periods, including for celebrations and work projects
