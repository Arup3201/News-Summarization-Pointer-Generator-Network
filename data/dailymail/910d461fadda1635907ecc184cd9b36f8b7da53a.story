A poorly pensioner claims he suffered a stroke when ruthless Transport for London bailiffs tried to snatch his furniture because of an unpaid parking ticket.

Mario Ansalone, 71, rushed out of his home when he saw strange men surrounding his car.

When he found out they were debt collectors wanting to take away his car or furniture, including his bed, he collapsed on the floor outside.

Mario Ansalone claims he suffered a stroke as bailiffs threatened to take away his furniture and bed

The former Rolls-Royce chauffeur had been fined £60 for parking in a ‘loading only’ bay.

After an unsuccessful appeal, he did not pay the penalty charge.

His wife Margaret returned home to find him lying on the floor twitching and quickly called an ambulance.

She said: ‘I splashed some water on him and he was grabbing at his face. If something like this happens again it’ll finish him.

'It was lucky I was coming around the corner at the time.

‘I told them to get out of here. But they said they wanted his bed.’ 

Mrs Ansalone, who has worked for a local authority for 40 years, said she was forced to pay the bailiffs an increased fee of £410 from their life savings after they threatened they would take either the car or furniture - including their bed.

'It is not right what is happening to disabled people in this country,’ she said. ‘They should lay off them.’

Mr Ansalone, who suffers from chronic ailments, including arthritis, hyper-tension, diabetes and memory loss, visited his GP surgery and said the doctor confirmed he had suffered a mini-stroke.

Italian-born Mr Ansalone, who moved to London from Naples in 1962, said: ‘I’m ill. What they did to me was terrible. I’m old and I’m disabled.

‘I feel humiliated; I just didn’t think something like this could happen in this day and age.’

The disabled blue-badge holder was fined by Transport for London (TfL) after parking in the ‘loading only’ zone while the couple popped into a shop to buy a toy for their grandchild.

A camera picked up the parking offence in November 2010.

Despite appealing, the couple were unsuccessful and TfL said letters were sent demanding the fine and warning of the consequences about not paying.

As they had not paid it, TfL outsourced the fine to a team of bailiffs who visited the couple’s two-bedroom ground-floor apartment in Bloomsbury, London, on April 5.

Labour MP Frank Dobson, who represents Mr Ansalone’s Camden constituency, said: ‘TFL definitely need to look into this.

'Even if they did not know he was disabled, you don’t take away a pensioner’s bed in any civilised society.

‘The bailiffs shouldn’t possibly think that it’s acceptable to take away anybody’s bed.’

A TfL spokesman was unable to confirm whether it provided the age of debtors to bailiffs or whether this was a factor in their debt-collecting methods.

Paul Cowperthwaite, TfL’s head of contracted services, said: ‘We sympathise with Mr Ansalone’s situation and it is unfortunate that bailiff action was necessary to secure payment for the PCN he incurred.

'Bailiffs are only used as a very last resort.

'Prior to them being instructed, people have the opportunity to appeal their PCN.

'Mr Ansalone was unsuccessful in his appeal with an independent adjudicator and was therefore required to pay the PCN.

‘We do have policies in place covering professionalism, conduct and vulnerable people to ensure that our customers are treated ethically and fairly.

'We have examined this case in detail and are satisfied normal procedures have been followed.

'We take any allegation of mistreatment very seriously and would be happy to investigate further if Mr Ansalone or his family can provide further details.’
