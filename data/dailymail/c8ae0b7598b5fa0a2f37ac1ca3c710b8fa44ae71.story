Another day, another debut at the Nou Camp, this time for midfielder Sergi Samper. But what's the story on Barcelona's latest youth-team star made good?

He's only 19 but Barcelona have already tied him down until 2017. That tells you how highly they rate him. He's been at the club since he was six and, judging from Wednesday night's first senior game, he is going to be around for a long time - and not be snatched by Arsene Wenger!

Well that is the concern that has made the club make sure his contract is in order. 

Coach Luis Enrique has shown even more willingness to blood youngsters than Pep Guardiola did and he is a big Samper fan so there is no chance of a move to Arsenal, or Tottenham for that matter – Andre Villas Boas was keen when he was still at White Hart Lane.

What sort of player is he?

On Wednesday he played in Sergio Busquets holding midfield position. His strength is in keeping possession but not at the expense of moving the ball forward purposefully. 

His touch and weight of pass – honed during those 13 years at the club - are what really make him stand out. He also sniffs out danger, anticipating the runs and passes of the opposition, proving you don't have to be physically imposing to play the position as long as you are clever.

Is he in the team for good now?

No. He will lead the Barca B team in Spain's second division this season and only make a handful of appearances in the first team. 

But next season – and remembering that Barcelona cannot make signings for one year – he will step up to the seniors and compete with Busquets for that central midfield berth.

But his debut went well?

He brought the house down with one steal, pirouette and pass all in one movement. He admitted post match: 'When I saw I was starting I got nervous but I soon calmed down and Xavi and Luis Enrique told me just to play as always have done in the youth teams.'

Starting out at Barcelona at six – that really must be a record?

As has been pointed out it takes the term 'one-club man' to new levels. Barcelona usually scour Catalonia and the rest of Spain for the best young talent but Samper has been one of theirs from the beginning. He's a symbol of what's healthy about their youth system. 

They'll be keen for people to remember that as they take their appeal over that transfer ban for breaking UEFA rules on signing Under-18s to the Court of Arbitration.

Seems like a transfer ban wouldn't actually hurt them a great deal if this is what they have coming through?

That's what some of their supporters are saying: More Sampers and less 17m euro Alex Songs.
