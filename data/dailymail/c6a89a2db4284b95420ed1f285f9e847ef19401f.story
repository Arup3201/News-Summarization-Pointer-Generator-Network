Desperate: Debra Wilson was pushed to the brink of suicide by unscrupulous loan sharks

Easy credit has turned Britain into a nation of debtors and we are currently £158billion in the red.

Nine million of us have serious financial problems due to personal borrowing, and desperate families are increasingly turning to controversial pay day loans and loan 'sharks' just to make ends meet.

Debra Wilson, a mother-of-four from Stanley in County Durham, is one woman whose life has been turned upside down by some ill-thought-out borrowing.

In
 December 2000 money was tight for Debra and her care worker husband 
Kevin. They borrowed £500 from a family friend to help make Christmas a 
bit more special for their four children.

Debra, who features
 on tonight's Channel 5 show 'My Spiral Into Debt Hell', described how Robert Reynolds, an old school friend known to them as 'Harpo' first talked them into
 taking out a small loan: 'He just said that he had someone 
that could lend us £500. We went for it, we were never told there would 
be any interest added at all.

'We thought we were just paying the £500 back. We thought he was our friend.'

Soon
 after Christmas Reynolds' 'contact' was demanding that double the amount 
of the original loan was paid back, and with no means of raising the 
funds the Wilson family began incurring huge interest charges.

As
 the months went by the debt spiralled out of control, and was to end up
 costing Debra her home, her health and almost her life.

After
 years of paying off up to £1,000 in interest each month, and being no 
closer to clearing the debt, the threats started and Reynolds suggested 
that he might have to sell the debt on to people who might damage their 
home, or even worse, physically attack Debra and her family.

She
 says: 'I wasn't coping very well. I had trouble going to sleep. The 
stress was really getting to my health. In 2005 I ended up having a 
stroke.'

Debra recovered from the stroke but there was no escaping the debt. Their 'friend' was now demanding £1200 per month.

Soon they were taking equity out of the house to pay the loan, as well as handing over any extra money that they earned.

Over the next few years Debra suffered four more strokes and a brain hemorrhage

Debra says: 'I actually thought about taking tablets and ending it all. I was upstairs with them in my hand.

'If it hadn't been for my youngest shouting up to me just at that point I think I would have taken those tablets.'

After an incredible eight years of living in fear, and making repayments of £128,000, Debra finally broke her silence and told local police.

It
 took her three days to describe the extent of the loan sharks extortion. When the police arrived at Reynolds' house they found hi-tech 
TV and stereo equipment as well as piles of designer clothes and luxury 
furniture and fittings. He had been spending Debra's money living the
 high life whilst her and her family lived in fear.

Reynolds went on trial in August 2009 and after pleading guilty to harassment was sentenced to 51 weeks in prison, suspended 
for two years, so he never actually faced time in prison.

He was ordered to pay Debra £1,500, which is less than the amount she had been paying him every month before he was held to account.

She says: 'If I hadn't revealed my story to police I would still be paying today. He should be in prison. I felt like I was in prison for ten years.'
