For decades they led the way in childrens' entertainment and were a constant fixture at birthday parties.

But the future of British clowns is now in serious doubt, and it is no laughing matter.

The entertainers claim an increasingly 'cynical' public image has seen membership at Clowns International (CI) drop from almost 1,000 in the 1980s to just 100.

They also argue TV characters such as The 
Simpsons' Krusty the Clown, who is portrayed as a heavy smoker and 
drinker, and filmmakers who turn friendly clowns into psychopaths, have contributed to the decline which could see the 
profession wiped out.

Conference cancelled: Clowns gather for the annual gathering in Butlins at the beginning of March in 2007. This year's event did not go ahead after the company withdrew its sponsorship

The clown in horror film It, based on the Stephen King novel, and
 the Joker, played by Heath Ledger in The Dark Knight, have created an increasingly sinister view of the entertainers, with children relating to them as villains rather than loveable comedians.

The average age of clowns has also risen,
 with fewer younger people wanting to take up the profession, and many 
have had to go part time as work at childrens' parties has dried up.

Former chairman of CI, Blue Brattle, told The Daily Telegraph: 'There is an image problem. There is a very negative view from Hollywood, with films like It and characters like Krusty.

He added it was no longer 'cool' for children to have clowns at a party, as parents are opting for television or film-themed events instead.

'Now its all DJs and paintball themed-parties.It's the way of the world, children and growing up quicker.

Cynical: A veteran entertainer has said clowns on TV, like The Simpson's degenerate, Krusty, have created a negative public image

'For some reason, clowning has been jumped upon as being unfashionable and the scary clown bandwagon has been particularly jumped upon. 

This year's annual gathering of clowns at Butlins in Bognor regis was cancelled this year after the holiday camp withdrew its sponsorship.

Attendees usually provide free entertainment to holidaymakers in exchange for free accommodation and food, but falling numbers have signaled the end of the deal.

Children having a phobia of clowns may also be blamed on the decline, but the 70-year-old veteran entertainer claims he has only met one person who had a genuine fear.

The problem is not confined to Britain with the World Clown Association reporting that membership has fallen from about 3,500 to 2,000 in the past decade.

The Joker, from the Batman films, is believed to have made coulrophobia more prevalent

Scientists generally agree that 
coulrophobia is a result of not knowing who lies behind the makeup, red 
nose and hair of a clown.

According
 to Coulrophobia Facts, research has shown the fear of clowns has 
increased since the Steven Spielberg's 1990s' film, 'It', which depicts a
 murderous clown.

The portrayal of the Joker in Batman films is also blamed.

According
 to the site, the phobia, which can cause panic, breathing difficulty 
and nausea, does prevent some people from eating at McDonalds.

Coulrophobia can affect both adults and children.
