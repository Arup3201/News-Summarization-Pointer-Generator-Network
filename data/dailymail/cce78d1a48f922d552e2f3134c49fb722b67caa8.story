Chris Jordan, released by Surrey less than two years ago, returned to his old stamping ground on Thursday night to demonstrate that he has fought back to become one of England’s most exciting young talents.

A new era desperately needs new stars and Jordan chose the perfect stage of The Kia Oval to show he is at the forefront of those who will be seeking to inspire England after the depths of their winter nightmare in Australia.

Here Jordan, who first came to England from his native Barbados on a scholarship with Dulwich College, thrived with both bat and ball to sentence Sri Lanka to only their second defeat in 21 completed games in all formats.

Having a blast: Sussex man Jordan had earlier smashed 38 runs from 13 balls

The fact that both of those losses came against England will encourage Alastair Cook at the start of a pivotal summer when he has been backed to build a new side alongside the returning coach Peter Moores.

For now England will be happy that they have got off to a winning start in this Royal London series against a gifted one-day team who have contested five of the last seven finals in global limited-overs tournaments.

It may be a new era but England are determined to stick to tried and tested methods in one-day cricket, backing their best batsmen to adapt rather than trying to inject dynamism in the form of Alex Hales into the top order.

Their policy worked, with Ian Bell looking much more suited to the longer limited-overs format than he did when making his Twenty20 comeback here in the defeat by Sri Lanka on Tuesday.

Firmly on the front foot: Gary Ballance hit five fours and a six during his swashbuckling 64

Bell looked in great nick as he reached 50 off 56 balls, with one glorious straight six, but he let himself down with a dopey dismissal with storm clouds gathering over South London about to halt England’s momentum.

Wickets can significantly effect targets under the Duckworth-Lewis method so Bell gave Sri Lanka quite a break when he steered Angelo Mathews to Lasith Malinga just before the heavens opened to register their disapproval at his folly.

It could have proved a key moment in this first of five one-day internationals but, once the Oval had been mopped up, England rallied with highly promising contributions from the Yorkshire pair of Gary Ballance and Joe Root and a quite brilliant late assault.

Jordan, now 25 and who rebuilt his career at Sussex last year, has proved himself quite a hitter in his short England career, most notably when he hit four sixes in the final over of a Twenty20 international in Bridgetown and then when he struck the only ball he received over the boundary against Scotland.

Debut to remember: Harry Gurney took two wickets - including that of the great Kumar Sangakkara

Now he showed the ability which will encourage England to believe they have unearthed a genuine all-rounder when he smashed 38 off just 13 balls, 93 runs coming off the last seven overs as Jos Buttler joined in with 26 off 20.

Together they lifted England to 247 for six off 39 overs with only the mystery spin of Sachithra Senanayake, who took three wickets, causing them any distress.

Malinga has longed proved imperious at the end of an innings, but he had never suffered like this against England before, his eight wicketless overs costing more runs, 71, than in 19 previous one-day internationals.

Handy contribution: Joe Root chipped in with some vital runs in the middle order

Even though Sri Lanka should have had the edge batting second when their target was reduced to 226 off 32 overs they were never in the hunt, with Jordan taking three wickets of his own as they fell 81 short of their adjusted aim.

The icing on the England cake was a superb running catch from Cook, who hailed a ‘really important win’ afterwards, to dismiss Mathews which was raucously received by an Oval crowd who backed up the captain’s assertion that the public are still behind his side.

They certainly will be if England keep on winning like this.
