A senior consultant killed a patient who went into private hospital for a routine knee operation by giving ‘exceptionally bad’ care, a court heard today.

David Sellu, 66, of Hillingdon, west London, ignored concerns that James Hughes, 66, was in excruciating pain following a simple procedure to replace the joint, the Old Bailey was told.

Mr Hughes, a retired builder from County Armagh, Northern Ireland, sustained an unexplained tear to his bowel during his stay at the BMI Healthcare-run Churchill Clementine Hospital in Harrow, London.

Prosecutor Bobbie Cheema QC told the jury he was in so much pain he called a doctor friend from his private hospital bed because he could not explain to the Hungarian doctor on duty the agony he was in.

James Hughes (left) was in excruciating pain, the Old Bailey heard. Although Dr David Sellu (right) knew his patient had a perforated bowel, he failed to operate for 40 hours, the jury was told

He was given paracetamol and the pain started to ease. But by 3.15pm his pain rating was ‘nine out of 10’ and there was a ‘sudden spike’ in his temperature, jurors were told.

This serious condition quickly led to blood poisoning and Mr Hughes suffered a fatal heart attack on February 14, 2010.

Although Sellu knew his patient had a perforated bowel, he failed to operate for 40 hours, the jury was told.

The surgeon went on to lie to Coroner Andrew Walker, claiming to have viewed the 66-year-old’s scans much earlier than hospital records showed, it is alleged.

Opening the case, Ms Cheema said: ‘This is a fairly common procedure and his consultant operated on him that day.

‘The operation went well and he was due to leave the hospital on Monday, February 16.

‘However... after the operation, while he was still in hospital, he developed abdominal pain.’

Sellu, a general surgeon with a specialism in colorectal conditions, was asked to treat Mr Hughes, the jury was told.

‘The defendant agreed to do so and he saw Mr Hughes that evening’, Miss Cheema said.

The Old Bailey heard that Mr Hughes was in so much pain he called a doctor friend from his private hospital bed because he could not explain to the Hungarian doctor on duty the agony he was experiencing

Sellu quickly concluded Mr Hughes was suffering from a ruptured bowel, the court heard.

‘This is a serious and life-threatening condition and it requires an operation.

‘However, Mr Sellu did not agree for an operation to be performed immediately.

‘Instead he decided to have a CT scan performed the next day.

‘However, again the defendant failed to carry out urgent surgery, even after being told the result of the CT scan.

‘He did not treat Mr Hughes’ case as an urgent case’, Miss Cheema said.

By the time Mr Hughes was brought into theatre, he ‘had been in pain for over 40 hours and was in a critical condition’.

‘The defendant did what he could to repair the damage, operating into the early hours of that Saturday morning.

‘Sadly, these efforts were all too late. He died the following day.

‘That death was avoidable.

‘Had Mr Sellu simply operated the night before, or even early during the day of the February 12, Mr Hughes would have had a very good chance of survival.

‘There was a series of missed opportunities and serious errors of judgment in his care of this patient and they combined to cause Mr Hughes’ premature death and the standard of care was exceptionally bad.’

The ‘catalogue of breaches of duty’ amounted to manslaughter by gross negligence, Miss Cheema said.

‘During the Coroner’s inquest into Mr Hughes’ death, this defendant was called to give evidence and before that he had supplied two statements for the purpose of the inquest.

‘The coroner asked him when had he first seen the results of the CT scan which he had delayed...he said it was around lunchtime.

‘The inquest was adjourned without reaching any verdict, but when the defendant’s evidence on that point was examined against electronic records that are held at the hospital.

‘These records demonstrated - without doubt - that Mr Sellu had first looked to see the records no earlier than 9pm, not around lunch as he had said.

‘The prosecution case is that in giving that evidence, which was untrue, this defendant deliberately sought to mislead the Coroner.’

Sennu was a senior lecturer in surgery at Imperial College from 1993 to 2000 and is an associate professor at a Florida University.

The trial is expected to last between three and four weeks. Sellu denies manslaughter and perjury.

The trial continues.
