Many people suffer a bad night’s sleep because they are woken up by their partner’s snoring.

But now a smart pillow could put an end to noisy nights as it can gently push a snorer into a new position to stop their snoring or wake them up gently – leaving their partner to slumber in peace.

The ‘snore activated nudging pillow’ is fitted with an integrated microphone that picks up the sonic vibrations of snoring.

The pillow’s integrated microphone picks up the sonic vibrations of snoring.

It automatically inflates an internal air bladder that increases the pillow’s depth by 3inches.

This elevation can open up a person's airways to prevent them from snoring.

The moment is also just enough to nudge a sleeper - perhaps onto their side. which also reduces snoring.

A control panel on the side of the device lets people set the sensitivity of the microphone and the depth of the nudge.The pillow has a power lead to plug into an electricity socket.

It then inflates an internal air pocket which makes the pillow three inches taller, which its creators believe is just enough to make a sleeper move their head or body.

Sleeping on your side reduces snoring because the base of the tongue will not collapse into the back of the throat to obstruct breathing.

The elevated angle of the pillow similarly opens a person's airways or prompts them to move into a better sleeping position - perhaps by rolling onto their side.

The device has a 30-minute delay setting to allow the user to fall asleep, without the pillow inflating and the microphone's sensitivity can be adjusted for light or heavy snoring.

Using a panel of buttons on the side of the soft device, users can set the snore pillow’s sensitivity to suit their needs.

High sensitivity is recommended for light snoring, while low sensitivity is recommended for heavy snoring.

The sound-activated air pocket expands and contracts to ensure breathing passages remain open and prevent snoring.

It can also be manually inflated to a desired thickness of between four and seven inches.

‘This will then reduce the chance of prolonged snoring waking your partner.’
