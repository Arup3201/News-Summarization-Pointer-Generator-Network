It was given the name of Forever Marilyn but, as these pictures prove, this statue's time in the spotlight was more of a temporary arrangement.

For the artist, it may well have brought a pang of sadness to see his 26-ft sculpture dismantled from its spot in the middle of Chicago.

However, others in the Windy City will no doubt be glad to see the back of a statue which has been described as one of the worst public art eyesores.

Forever Marilyn: Despite the statue's name, it's stint in Chicago has come to an end since it was unveiled last July

The enormous tribute to the movie 
icon - titled Forever Marilyn by artist Seward Johnson - was dismantled 
yesterday after going on display in the Windy City last July. However, 
following an initial bemused curiosity, the statue has since been mocked
and criticised in equal measure.

It
has been panned as one of the world's biggest eyesores and was, at one 
time, ranked number one on the Virtual Tourist website's top ten list of
worst public art.

The 
statue, under which passers-by can
freely gaze up the screen siren's skirt, captures the iconic moment in 
The Seven Year Itch when the movie star bashfully held her dress down as
a gust of wind billowed the fabric around her.

However,
it has come in more useful as a giant umbrella, as scores of spectators
have been using the huge structure as a safe haven to shelter from 
Chicago downpours.

The stainless steel and aluminum sculpture, which is 26 feet tall and weighs a whopping 34,000lbs, has raised a few eyebrows.

Not least because visitors to the 
plaza are at once confronted with Monroe's pert bottom in gleaming white
panties and her perfect pins bedecked in white, open-toe kitten heels.

'Crude': People were able to look directly up Marilyn's dress... and some even used it as a shelter to protect themselves from the rain

In pieces: The 26-foot statue, based on a scene from the movie Seven Year Itch, was taken down after being on display since last July

Detractors have found so many things 
to criticise about this work that it's hard to know where to start: Its 
26-foot size; its impropriety given that the movie to which it pays 
tribute - 1955's The Seven Year Itch - is set in New York; and its 
perceived crudeness given that viewers are able to look directly up her 
dress.

Abraham Ritchie wrote on Art Chicago 
Blog after the statueâ€™s unveiling was a 'creepy schlock from a 
fifth-rate sculptor that blights a first-rate public art collection.'

But the Zeller Realty Group, which 
owns the plaza and now its statue, responded by defending the art work: 
'[Paul Zeller] likes to bring in things that cause a conversation,' said
a spokesman from the company.

'They might be controversial, but he likes art that makes people think.'
