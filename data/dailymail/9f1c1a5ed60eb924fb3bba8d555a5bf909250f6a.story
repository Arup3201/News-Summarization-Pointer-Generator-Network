The moment a 51-year-old man was knocked unconscious with one punch and then kicked multiple times while he had his phone and watch snatched has been captured in harrowing footage on CCTV.

The footage, which was released by police today, shows him being viciously attacked and robbed on the side of a busy road in Birmingham as he walked home from a party in the early hours of the morning on December 15.

One of the attackers is seen throwing a ceramic plate at the victim, in an apparent attempt to distract him, as the other punched him in the head from behind. The same man in later seen repeatedly kicking him in the head while the other searches his pockets.

The footage shows over a dozen vehicles driving past the attack as it happens on Bordesley Green at the junction of Pikewater Road and Whitehall road, until one concerned passer-by stops his car and calls an 
ambulance after the attack had ended.

The victim, who has chosen to remain anonymous and has not seen the footage himself, was attacked while he was heading home from a birthday party at 1.10am on December 15 last year.

He has suffered 
long-lasting physical and psychological damage from the mugging, with injuries including extensive cuts
 to the face that required stitches, likely leaving permanent scars.

Because he was knocked out cold immediately, he was unable to give the police a description of his attackers, who still remain unknown and at large.  

One attacker kicks the victim in the head repeatedly, while the other goes through the pockets of the victim, robbing him of his phone and watch

West Midlands Police released the 
video in the hope that witnesses to the attack will come forward and 
provide them with a clearer picture of who the attackers were.

In a statement, the victim called his attackers 'cowards', urging the local community to come forward and provide any information they had about those responsible.

He said: 'This community will not tolerate or accept crimes such as the one inflicted on myself, and people should be safeguarded from these thugs.

'On the advice of others, I have chosen not the view the CCTV, but I want such cowardly perpetrators to know the psychological damage you inflict on innocent people can be irreparable.'

The attackers end their assault after about a minute, casually strolling away from the scene having robbed and viciously beaten the victim

Chief Inspector Dawn Miskella, from Birmingham CID, said: 'The footage speaks for itself - it was an absolutely horrendous, unprovoked attack on an innocent man who was making his way home from a night out, leaving him with long-lasting injuries.

'He suffered extensive cuts to his face and head which required stitches and will leave permanent scarring, along with other cuts and bruises to his body.

'There’s also the psychological impact of the assault and, of course, the loss of his watch and phone.

'I would appeal directly to those people who drove past the scene as the robbery was taking place to please come forward and speak to us.'
