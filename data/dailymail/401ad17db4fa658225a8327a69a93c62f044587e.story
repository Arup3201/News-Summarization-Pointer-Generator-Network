Josh Lyons' release by Tottenham knocked his self-confidence to the extent he felt unable to go out socially

A talented striker who spiralled into depression after being dropped by a Premier League football club took his own life an inquest heard.

Josh Lyons, 26, from Crawley East Sussex, was picked for the Tottenham Hotspur youth side as a schoolboy and was thrilled to be playing for the team he supported.

But after working for three years to get a professional contract, he was released by the London side aged just 16 leaving him ‘feeling like a failure.’

At an inquest into his death a coroner condemned the lack of support he received from the top London club.

Mr Lyons went on to have spells at other youth sides, but didn't have the same passion and enthusiasm for football and started to suffer from anxiety which left him unable to go out with friends.

It was at Crawley Town where he bowed out from the game, when he was dropped by the side aged 18.

The inquest, in Horsham, West Sussex, heard how after suffering years of depression, Mr Lyons ended his life on a railway line near Ifield West Sussex after telling his parents he was going for a run in March this year.

Speaking at the inquest last week, assistant deputy coroner Karen Henderson criticised the sport saying that professional clubs should do more to support young footballers.

She said: 'It was that pivotal point that crushed a young man's life and all the dreams that go with it.

'That one moment I find was the single most important factor that led to the events that ended up on the train tracks.

'It is very difficult to build up the hopes of a young man only then to have them dashed at a young age. It is very cruel.

'I find there was an absence and lack of support in football.'

The inquest heard how Josh started his junior career with Wimbledon, before being spotted by Spurs.

After the rejection he sunk into depression, and had to come home from traveling in Thailand because he felt so unwell.

In 2008 he visited a GP saying that he had been having thoughts of suicide. He was referred to a counsellor and was treated with medication and therapy for four years.

Mr Lyons was hit by a train on the main London Victoria to Portsmouth line.

Speaking after the inquest his devastated father Liam, 57, said: 'By playing for Spurs, who he supported, Josh was fulfilling every boy's dream.

'But he was released after three years and it was a massive blow to his self-esteem and self-confidence.

'Josh felt as though he  was a failure.'

Spurs also offered their condolences to the family, and said that more is now being done to support players who don't make the grade.

A spokesman said: ''Club support mechanisms have evolved considerably in the past decade.

'We place a strong emphasis on creating a safe environment where our players are able to discuss any kind of issue

Leon McKenzie has spoken about how he attempted suicide

with academy staff as well as employing a strong pastoral team to work with our coaches and host families in terms of caring for our young players.

'We also fully support Premier League workshops that promote positive mental health and encourage emotional well-being.

'The club is committed to giving support to youngsters beyond their playing time with us, assisting in planning for their futures by offering support and advice in terms of further education, vocational work or even in helping them to try and find a new club.

'We are deeply saddened to hear of Josh’s passing and extend our sincerest condolences to his family and friends.'

The death comes at a time where depression in football has arisen as a major issue in the beautiful game.

In November 2011 former Newcastle United, Everton and Leeds star Gary Speed hanged himself after a long struggle with depression.

Former Norwich City striker Leon McKenzie also tried to kill himself after a serious injury coincided with the the breakdown of his marriage and family.

And in 2009 German international goalkeeper Robert Enke also took his own life after a struggle with depression.
