A massive operation to retake Iraq's second-largest city from the Islamic State using up to 25,000 Iraqi troops will likely begin in April or May, a senior U.S. military official said today.

The official from U.S. Central Command said the operation would involve 12 Iraqi brigades, five of which would be trained for the mission by the coalition in the coming weeks. 

Those five would make up the core fighting force that would launch the attack.

But they would be supplemented by three smaller brigades serving as reserve forces, along with three Peshmerga brigades who would contain the Islamic State fighters from the north and west.

News of the offensive comes amid reports the terror group is facing a growing number of defections and cases of corruption in its ranks in two of its major strongholds, Mosul and Raqqa.

Sprawling terror: News of the offensive comes amid reports ISIS is facing a growing number of defections and cases of corruption in its ranks in two of its major strongholds, Mosul and Raqqa

Sources say morale has plummeted in recent weeks following the loss of the Syrian city of Kobane and disgust over the horrific murder of the Jordanian pilot who was burned to death.

In its de facto capital of Raqqa, activists say disillusioned jihadi militants are trying to steal identity papers from locals in a bid to flee to Turkey or areas controlled by the Nusra Front, an Al Qaeda affiliate fighting ISIS in Syria.

The group, Raqqa Is Being Slaughtered Silently, says ISIS is becoming increasingly concerned about the problem and is making announcements in mosques re-iterating that its fighters are banned from such thefts.

Meanwhile, one activist in Mosul said residents were desperately finding ways to circumvent a written guarantee imposed by ISIS that allows the jihadists to take property from people who flee the city.

Some were being helped by corrupt ISIS officials who are agreeing to turn a blind eye for a $500 bribe, it was reported by The Times.

Giving further details of the planned assault on Mosul, the U.S. official said there also would also be a fighting force, largely made up of former Mosul police and tribal forces, who would have to be ready to go back into the city once the army units clear out the Islamic State fighters.

Included in the force would be a brigade of Iraqi counterterrorism forces who have been trained by U.S. special operations forces.

The brigades include roughly 2,000 troops each. The official was not authorized to discuss the operation publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.

Military leaders don't often disclose as many details of an operation before it takes place, but in some cases it can have an impact on the enemy, trigger a reaction or even prompt some militants to flee before the assault begins.

The operation itself comes as no surprise to the Islamic State group. Iraqi leaders have for months made it publicly clear that they were planning an operation to retake Mosul and that they were eager to get started.

In addition, U.S. officials had already acknowledged that they were beginning preparations for the Mosul mission, including using airstrikes to shut down supply lines that the insurgents were using to get equipment or people in and out of the city.

Asked why U.S. Central Command was telegraphing the timeframe and details of the operation to the enemy, the official said it was important to highlight the effort the Iraqi security forces are putting into the mission and how committed they are to it.

The official said the U.S. will provide military support for the operation, including training, air support, intelligence and surveillance.

The official said there has been no decision made yet on whether to send in some U.S. ground troops to help call in airstrikes. 

That decision would be made by senior defense and military leaders and President Barack Obama.

Islamic State militants overtook Mosul last June, as the group marched across large sections of Iraq and Syria, sending Iraqi forces fleeing. 

At this point, officials estimate there are between 1,000 to 2,000 Islamic State insurgents in the city of Mosul. Military leaders have been talking about retaking the city for some time, but they have said they won't launch the operation until the Iraqi troops are ready.

The official said they wanted to retake Mosul in the spring, before the summer heat and the holiday month of Ramadan kick in.

"But by the same token, if they're not ready, if the conditions are not set, if all the equipment they need is not physically there and they (aren't) trained to a degree in which they will be successful, we have not closed the door on continuing to slide that to the right," he said.

Under the plan, the approximately 3,200 Iraqi forces that have completed the training already or are going through it now would replace the five main brigades wherever thay are now, and those five units would then go through several weeks of final training before the Mosul operation begins.

The official also revealed for the first time that Qatar has agreed to host a training site for coalition forces to train moderate Syrian rebels who would return to Syria to fight the Islamic State forces there.

Other sites are in Turkey, Jordan and Saudi Arabia.

The training facility in Jordan is ready to go. The technical agreement on the Turkey training site was signed Thursday, and it is nearly ready.

The facility in Saudi Arabia will be ready to open in one to three months, and the site in Qatar will be finished in six to nine months, the official said.

The U.S. and other coalition nations will train the Syrian fighters so they can return to their own country and battle the Islamic State group.
