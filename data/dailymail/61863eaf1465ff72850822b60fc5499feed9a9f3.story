Mass for English-speaking Catholics will be led using the new translation of the Roman Missal, which is intended to be closer to the Latin original

English-speaking Roman Catholics may have noticed a little something different during their church services today as a new translation of the liturgy is introduced.

For decades at the very beginning of Mass, the priest has greeted the congregation by saying 'The Lord be with you' and congregants responded: 'And also with you.'

However starting today in the English-speaking world, the response has become: 'And with your spirit.'

Familiar prayers, both spoken and chanted, have also changed to contain new words like 'consubstantial' and 'incarnate.

In the Nicene Creed, which is recited during services, the affirmation 'We believe' has been replaced with 'I believe'

The
changes were agreed following a year-long process to produce an English
translation that is closer to the original Latin of the Roman Missal - 
the text of prayers and instructions for celebrating Mass.

It is the most significant change to 
worship for English-speaking believers since the Second Vatican Council 
in the 1960s, which was held at the Vatican in Rome to address relations
between the Roman Catholic Church and the modern world.

An English-language missal was produced by 1973, but that was intended to be temporary while improvements were made.

In 2001, the Vatican office that 
oversees worship issued a directive requiring translation of the English
missal that would be closer to the Latin rather than to more familiar 
vernacular speech.

All change: Services will all be held using the new translation of the Roman Missal, which has become compulsory

Numerous revisions and bishops' meetings eventually produced agreement on the translation being used this weekend.

Britain's
five million Catholics have already been dealing with half of the new 
liturgy since September. However, the full translation has become 
compulsory as of today.

Monsignor Michael Clay, pastor of St Ann Catholic Church in Clayton, North Carolina says he likes the new translation, but is aware of some priests and parishioners who have been less enthusiastic.

Critics say the new version is too laboured and in some cases have circulated petitions that called for a delay in introducing the new missal.

Mr Clay said: 'It's human nature that we're resistant to change.

'I'm old enough to remember when we went from Latin to English, and that was just a huge change.'

Parishes and dioceses around the U.S. have spent months trying to prepare Catholics for the change.

Priest: The lord be with you

Response: And also with you

Start of the Nicene Creed: 'We believe in one God.'

Believe in: seen and unseen

The relationship between Jesus and the Father: consubstantial

To receive Communion: 'Lord, I am not worthy to receive you . .                                            

Priest: The lord be with you

Response: And with your spirit

Start of the Nicene Creed: 'I believe in one God.’

Believe in: visible and invisible.

The relationship between Jesus and the Father: one in Being

To receive Communion: 'Lord, I am not worthy that you should enter under my roof . . .'

Descriptions of the new translation have been printed in weekly bulletins, seminars have been held and since many parishes have been gradually introducing the new translation piece by piece, starting with the parts of the liturgy that are sung.

'Most of those activities are for the benefit of the average Catholic, but it's priests who have more new material to master.

'I've had a new missal in my hands for about three weeks now, and I've been literally practicing the prayers.

'I've been doing this now for 31 years, and a lot of these prayers I actually know by memory. I have to make sure my brain isn't getting ahead of my mouth.'

 'I've been literally practicing the prayers...a lot of these prayers I actually
know by memory. I have to make sure my brain isn't getting ahead of my 
mouth.'

The Church of Notre Dame in Morningside Heights, New York City had leaflets printed informing its parishioners of the changes.

Parishioner, Camelia Flye, of Harlem, learnt Mass in Latin as a youngster told the New York Daily News: 'I’m 63, so this is all going back to the old for me. It’s great.'

However, Ellen Smith, 50, who attends services at the Church of the Holy Name of Jesus also in New York isn't keen on the changes.

She said: 'Hopefully, it’ll bring more consciousness to the words we say when we’re praying.

'But there’s something I don’t like about making it uniform that prevents the unique cultural influences from each community that might be taken away.'

Pauline Ioelu, 29, who moved to Washington Heights this year from New Zealand, where the changes have already taken place said: 'If you know your faith, then it’s not really a big deal.

'It’s very close to the Catholic culture and its origins, and it makes it more helpful in understanding it.'
