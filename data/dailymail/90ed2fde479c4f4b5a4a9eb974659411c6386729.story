An NFL rookie is being called a hero after pulling a family to safety from a burning car Tuesday.

Jonathan ‘Tig’ Willard, an undrafted free agent rookie with the Tennessee Titans, and another man pulled a mother, her three children and their dog from their car as it burned on the side of a Tennessee highway Tuesday while driving to Titans training camp.

‘They’re my angels, they’re a Godsend, it was a miracle that they were there,’ Cheri Hubbard told Good Morning America.

Willard, 23, was about two hours from training camp when he saw a car in front of him smoking, according to reports.

‘I saw this car in front of me, and it had all kinds of black smoke coming out of it,’ Willard told TigerNet, adding ‘I tried to speed up and get up next to the car to let them know the car was on fire.’

The former standout Clemson University linebacker pulled next to the smoking while car frantically blowing his horn and convinced the woman to pull over, he told WKRN. Once on the side of the road, he realized how dire the situation was, he added.

‘I saw three small kids in the back seat," said Willard. "So I'm thinking, hurry up and get the kids and everybody out.’

He and another good Samaritan were able to pull the mother, three kids and their Chihuahua to safety only minutes before the car, fully engulfed in flames, blew up, he told TigerNet.

‘The adrenaline just kicked in, I was in go mode,’ Willard told Good Morning America, adding ‘I feel that God put me in the right place, at the right time because he knew I would find it in my heart to help.’

The mother of three did not initially pull over because she thought it was a different car that was on fire, according to TigerNet.

Hubbard was grateful Willard was in the right place at the right time.

‘She just kept thanking me,’ Hubbard told TIgerNet, ‘that car was gone, it went up quick.’

Despite his heroic pit stop, Willard was able to report to training camp on-time, though he likely would have been forgiven if he had been late.

‘Maybe we need to have him stand up in front of the team and explain what happened so we can start on an obviously very positive note," Titans head coach Mike Munchak said. " I'm proud of him, and so is the organization, that he got involved in something that could have been bad.’

Willard signed with the Titans as a free agent after going unpicked during the NFL Draft.He led the Clemson Tigers with 95 tackles while starting all 12 games in his senior season.
