A teenager who threatened to 'cut up' neighbours with his machete after they dared stand up to him has been evicted from his home after terrorising them for nine months.

Reece Huskinson, 19, stood at one pregnant woman's back door with a knife, saying 'I'm going to kill your kids', and fired a pellet gun at another woman as she took the rubbish out, Blackpool magistrates were told.

The court heard that police recorded 35 separate incidents of antisocial behaviour against Huskinson, who rented the three-bedroom terraced house in the Layton area of Blackpool, with his then girlfriend and her three children.

The teenager moved into the privately-rented home in Garrick Grove at the beginning of the year

The trouble began almost immediately he moved in to the quiet street of Garrick Grove in January this year and told one neighbour who stopped him racing up and down the street on his mini motorbike: 'You think this is trouble, wait for the trouble that is going to kick in.'

He also took pot shots at neighbours with a ball-bearing pellet gun, threatened others with a baseball bat, threw bags of dog waste at children, kicked in doors and clambered across roofs to spy on women in their own homes.

The cocky teenager would also be seen parading up and down the streets in just a vest and boxer shorts, and would allow his Staffordshire Bull Terrier to frighten local residents.

Police obtained a closure order on Huskinson’s home after collating a dossier of evidence from his neighbours in the seaside resort, which enabled magistrates to grant a house closure order under the Anti Social Behaviour Act, forcing Huskinson out of the terraced house.

Mother-of-two Tracy Fisher, 32, who lives in neighbouring Alder Grove, said: 'We are so relieved he’s gone as our lives were made a living hell.

'He didn’t have a job and I think he must have sat there every day plotting what to do next and how to terrorise people - every single person on the street had had a grievance with him.

'We were ready to move because he threatened to petrol bomb the house. I had to keep the doors locked as we believed we were in danger.

'l was heavily pregnant and one night when he was kicking off, I went outside to confront him because my little boy was in bed. But he threatened to cut my kids up.

'I came back inside shaking, but he was up at the back door with a knife - I could see the blade shimmering.

'He said "I’m going to kill your kids, I swear on my sister’s grave."  I ended up going into labour two months early. He knew he was intimidating me.'

Mrs Fisher added: 'He would rev the engine late into the evenings waking up my two-year-old son, but when I asked him to stop he just hurled abuse at me and it got worse from there.

A tip: The terraced property in Garrick Grove has piles of rubbish in the back garden and is now boarded up

'There was something every single day. He thought he owned the whole street.'

She said he encouraged his girlfriend's children to throw dog faeces at people's houses, and sent his Staffordshire bull terrier into the house of a woman whose daughter is frightened of dogs.

She added: 'He smeared dog poo on our doors - I was terrified it would get in my children’s eyes. One time he threw it in bags that had been split into the garden just as we were about to have my son’s second birthday party - we had to cancel it.'

Mrs Fisher said Huskinson would climb onto the roof of his terraced house's extension and stare at her in her kitchen.

She said: 'He used to sit there as I washed up so he could see me, and as I moved he would move along the roofs, leaping across all the extensions mouthing and jeering ‘"Come on come on". I have never felt so sick in my life.'

Good riddance: Huskinson has moved on from the terraced house but is thought to still be living in Blackpool

Another neighbour, Cheryl Cooksey, 26, said: 'He used to sit at the window firing his BB gun as I took the rubbish out. I heard this ping against my door and he had obviously been trying to hit me but thankfully he missed.

'I was forever getting my two children who are two and five back inside because I didn’t like them being outside on their own. I’m glad that he has gone.'

'You used to hear him every night on that bike circling the street, he even put his children on. He caused a lot of trouble.'

Prosecutor Chris Keogh told Blackpool magistrates: 'Our evidence shows there was foul language used to adults and children, criminal damage, threatening behaviour, fly tipping and stone throwing.

'There was also incidents where dog dirt was thrown into neighbours homes.'

After the case,  PCSO Lucy Hesketh of Lancashire Police said: 'We welcome the decision of the court to grant this initial three-month closure order and give the residents some respite from what was disruptive and disgraceful behaviour.'

It is not known where Huskinson has moved on to, though he is believed to still be in the city.
