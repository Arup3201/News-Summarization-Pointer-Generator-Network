A woman who described herself as a ‘real life Princess Fiona’ has lost six stone in weight after an embarrassing incident that left her stuck in her cinema seat.

Victoria Lambley, 36, from Nottingham, had spent the evening watching Shrek in her local cinema.  but when the lights went up at the end of the film she tried to stand up - only to find she was stuck in her chair.

Mother of three, who at 5ft 2in weighed 16st, struggled to lift herself out but remained firmly wedged.

Eventually managing to free herself, a mortified Victoria vowed to lose weight. Now, four years on, she weighs just 10st and wears a size 10 dress.

'When I realised I was trapped in the seat I wanted the ground to swallow me up - it was humiliating,' she said.

'I was out with my kids and struggled to get out before the lights came on and people saw. I had to push my chunky thighs out from under the arm rests. It really shocked me. I could no longer deny how big I'd become.

'Since I've lost the weight I feel so much better, but I still keep my old jeans to remind me never to go back.'

Victoria had always been big, never having been below a size 16, but gained more weight as she got older and had children.

At her biggest she was wearing a size 20, and claims even that was a squeeze.

She said: 'Everything was a challenge when I was overweight - I couldn't walk anywhere or do stuff with my kids.

'I'd diet for a week, but then reward myself with a takeaway if I lost half a pound.

'Getting stuck in the cinema made me realise how bad I was - I was the real life Princess Fiona.

'I panicked - it's the same feeling as when you get a ring stuck on your finger, but much more embarrassing.'

Since the incident at the Savoy Cinema in 2009, Nottingham, Victoria has joined Weight Watchers and lost six stone.

She has now been at her target weight for over a year but admits that chocolate is her weakness.

'I would eat a few bars every day, especially Time Outs. And I'd go through family bags of crisps. My car was stuffed with emergency chocolate snacks,' she said.

'I thought the weight loss classes would be like Little Britain and I'd be weighed in front of everyone, but nothing else had worked for me and I had to try it.

'My friend dragged me along and now I never miss a class. It's not at all like I expected, we're like a family.'

For Victoria the class really was family, as her brother Matthew, 33, joined and lost eight and a half stone himself.

Victoria said: 'I got him into it, but he carried on and did the hard work himself. He's been really supportive and I couldn't have done it without him.'

Since losing the weight Victoria's confidence has rocketed and she's even found love.

She said: 'I've known Christian since we were kids, but I never thought a nice guy like him would be interested in me. But thanks to my new confidence we got together and now we're engaged.

'We're in no rush to get married but I can't wait to fit into a size ten wedding dress.'
