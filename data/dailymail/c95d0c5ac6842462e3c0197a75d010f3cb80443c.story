The remains of an elderly man were discovered in his own back yard leading to his housekeeper's ex-boyfriend being charged with first-degree murder.

Police were contacted by the caretaker, who had been out of town for a few days, after her 74-year-old employer disappeared.

Juan Reyes, 47, who lived at the man's home in Port Charlotte, Florida, was charged with his murder after detectives 'believe that the elderly gentleman had succumb to some injuries by the boyfriend'.

The body has been taken to the medical examiner's office for identification and to determine cause of death. The victim's name was not being released at this time.

Reyes is being held without bond at the Charlotte County Jail.
