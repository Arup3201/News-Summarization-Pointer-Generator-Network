Antonio Valencia is the latest player to join Manchester United's injury list.

The Ecuador winger has tweaked a hamstring  and, although the injury is not too serious, it is expected to rule him out of Monday's game at West Bromwich Albion.

The 29-year-old is understood to have picked up the strain during United's win over Everton on October 5, where he was replaced after 79 minutes by Marouane Fellaini.

The injury will beg further questions in the United camp about what they are doing wrong in their pre-emptive work which is supposed to protect against soft-tissue injuries.

New physio Matt Radcliffe started this week and he will be among staff being charged to find a solution by United boss Louis van Gaal. 

Defender Paddy McNair has a hamstring injury, Phil Jones is recovering from one picked up on England duty while Chris Smalling is edging back after his thigh strain.

United have used 30 players in the Premier League already this season with injuries stretching the squad to its limit.

Midfielder Michael Carrick is stepping up his recovery from ankle ligament damage and hopes to make the bench for the trip to The Hawthorns on Monday.

United had hoped to play Carrick in a behind-closed-doors friendly but may have to make do with practice games among themselves. 

Only Burnley have come forward so far. They have agreed to play a game at their Gawthorpe training ground on Friday morning, but the timing may not be not ideal for Carrick as it would allow just 72 hours recovery time ahead of the Albion fixture.

Meanwhile, defender Jonny Evans is training again following his bruised ankle bone.
