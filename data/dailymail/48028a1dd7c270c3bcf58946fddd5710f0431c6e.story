England and Northampton have been boosted by the news that Alex Corbisiero is set to return to Aviva Premiership action before the New Year.

The 26-year-old Lions prop had surgery to repair damaged ligaments after dislocating his shoulder playing against Bath in September and missed England’s autumn campaign. That followed an intensely frustrating previous season which saw him need surgery on both knees.

Corbisiero has played a full role in training in recent days and Saints coach Jim Mallinder even considered starting him in the derby clash with Leicester at Franklin’s Gardens on Saturday.

The 26-year-old loosehead has been out of action since he dislocated his shoulder against Bath in September

But a specialist has recommended an extra week on the sidelines meaning that, bar any last-minute setbacks, the 19-cap prop will start against Harlequins at Twickenham on December 27.

‘Alex is training well and is ready to go,’ a Saints insider said on Wednesday. ‘He could have played this weekend but medical advice says he should be given the full 12 weeks to recover from the surgery.’

Corbisiero’s pending return is excellent news for Stuart Lancaster and his coaching team following a difficult autumn spell which saw England’s squad severely depleted by injury. Wasps and England lock Joe Launchbury saw a specialist on Wednesday following a slower-than-expected recovery from a neck injury which continues to threaten his Six Nations participation.

Corbisiero starred for the Lions in their series victory over Australia in 2013 and scored a try in the third Test 

But Premiership champions Saints are in rude health. Centre Luther Burrell is also set to start against Leicester after fully recovering from a broken bone in his hand which has seen him eased back into action in recently weeks.

Saints yesterday confirmed that seven players, including England hooker Dylan Hartley and lock Courtney Lawes, have signed contract extensions.

Hartley, 28, had been considering a move to French Top 14 outfit Montpellier but turned down a big-money move, as exclusively revealed by Sportsmail on Tuesday, in order to stay at a club he has served for almost a decade.

Corbisiero's return is a welcome boost for England as Joe Launchbury is expected to miss the Six Nations 

RFU rules make overseas-based players ineligible for England selection and while Hartley’s proposed deal to move to France would have begun after next year’s World Cup, the 61-cap hooker admits the threat of international exile was the biggest factor in his decision to stay.

‘It wasn’t a straightforward decision,’ he said. ‘I’m in my 10th season at Saints and I had to seriously consider the pros and cons. I thought it might be time for a new challenge.

‘I’ve been here for a long time and also that new challenge would have meant a significant pay rise. But when I weighed it up, the ultimate for me is playing for England and if I went, I wouldn’t be able to do that.

‘If I had gone, I still would have been eligible for the World Cup, but after that I’d have drawn a line under playing for England. That was one of the biggest blocks to stop me from going.’

l Harlequins on Wednesday night confirmed Sportsmail’s story from October that Australia lock James Horwill, 29, will join them after the World Cup. 

Quins director of rugby Conor O’Shea said: ‘James is known around the world not only for his uncompromising style of play but also for his strength of character. He will be an asset for us on the field and within the changing room.’ Horwill has won 58 caps.
