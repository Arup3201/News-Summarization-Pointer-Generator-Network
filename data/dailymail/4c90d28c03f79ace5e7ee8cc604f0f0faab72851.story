The Saudi victim of a frenzied stabbing in Colchester has been laid to rest in a desert funeral attended by thousands of mourners.

Nahid Almanea, 31, was buried in her native Al Jouf, Saudi Arabia, on Saturday afternoon after her body was released by Essex police and flown back to the Middle East.

Pictures carried by local media showed crowds of sombre and distraught men present for Ms Almanea's tragic homecoming and her funeral beneath a blazing desert sun.

Police are still hunting the killer who last Tuesday morning stabbed her 16 times and left her to die as she walked home from university along a quiet footpath in a park in Colchester.

She had been taking an English language course at the University of Essex since January as part of her studies for a life sciences PhD.

A line of investigation is considering whether she may have been targeted because of her distinctive Muslim clothing, which included a full-length abaya robe and multi-coloured hijab headscarf.

However chilling similarities between the attack on Ms Almanea and another murder three months earlier have led to speculation that there may be a serial killer on the loose in Colchester.

Police are continuing to investigate an incident in which a woman fought off an as she jogged less than a mile from the scene of Ms Almanea's murder last Thursday.

The alleged assault came just hours after police had warned residents not to go out alone to secluded areas.

Hundreds of people gathered at the student's funeral following her death last week

Officers yesterday drained three 
fishing lakes in their continuing search for the murder weapon and 
announced they wanted to speak to a who was wearing a beige 
Italian-style designer jacket near the crime scene on Tuesday.

Detectives investigating the murder Nahid Almanea have appealed for two cyclists seen nearby to come forward.

The man and woman were seen cycling close to where the Saudi Arabian student was murdered as she walked along a quiet footpath in Colchester, Essex.

It is thought they may have seen Ms Almanea after she was stabbed 16 times and left to die last Tuesday.

The pair, both believed to be in their 20s, were spotted on Salary Brook Trail heading towards the Greenstead estate at 10.45am on Tuesday, June 17.

The man is described as having olive skin, dark hair and is tall and slim, while the woman has long dark hair and was wearing a 'flowing pattern tiered shirt'.

Police have released a photo of a similar jacket to the one the man was wearing.

He
 is described as being aged from his late teens to 30, tanned and of 
average build with thick, black hair in a two-to-three-inch 'mop style 
on top'.

A second man who police would like to speak to is described as white, aged between 18 and 25, with a medium build and dark hair. Police said he was seen running up Hewes Close at around 10.56am.

He was wearing a long-sleeved, plain 'London Bus red' hooded top and dark trousers.

Police have also previously appealed 
for help to track down a man who tried to attack a jogger less than a 
mile from where Ms Almanea was killed.

The
 white man, thought to be in his early 20s, around 5ft 7in and of medium
 build with a narrow face and possibly fair hair, tried to attack the 
woman in Peache Road, Colchester, at around 10pm last Thursday.

Today officers continued an 'intensive' fingertip search around three fishing lakes near the footpath where Ms Almanea was killed

More than 100 police officers from Essex, Kent and the Metropolitan Police are involved in the investigation into Ms Almaneaâ€™s brutal killing, as well as profilers from the National Crime Agency.

Essex Police DCI Steve Worron said 
police, who are yet to find the murder weapon, are 'open-minded' about 
links between the student's death and that of James Attfield.

Mr
 Attfield, 33, was stabbed 102 times on his arms, hands, back, neck and 
head in what police described as a 'senseless and frenzied' attack in 
Colchester in March.

DCI Steve Worron (pictured) said he wants to speak to a man wearing a designer jacket similar to this one

'Our advice to people is that we have now had two knife murders in Colchester in less than three months where the motive for the attacks remains unknown,' said DCI Worron.

'Against that background we would advise everyone in the town to remain vigilant.'

Police have arrested and questioned 
two people this week over the murder - a 52-year-old man followed by a 
19-year-old man - but eliminated both from their enquiries.

Earlier
 this week police released the last known CCTV images of the victim.

Police released footage believed to be Ms Almanea walking past shops in Hunwicke not long before her death
