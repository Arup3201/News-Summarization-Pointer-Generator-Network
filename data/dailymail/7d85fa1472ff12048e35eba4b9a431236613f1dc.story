Sinitta has finally set the record straight about the 'heartbreaking' abortion she and Simon Cowell went through together in the 1980s.

After a week which has seen her launch a number of extraordinary rants regarding the pair's relationship via her Twitter page, the 49-year-old singer has opened up about the termination that left she and the music mogul utterly 'devastated'.

The So Macho hitmaker dismissed reports claiming the incident happened behind the back of the 53-year-old television boss, explaining that on the contrary, it was something that they mutually decided when they were 'both young'.

'Devastating': Sinitta has finally set the record straight about the 'heartbreaking' abortion she and Simon Cowell went through together in the 1980s

News of the abortion originally broke last month, when Sinitta revealed the tragic news to The Mirror. However, Sinitta later said that the publication didn't give her the opportunity to 'defend' her decision, as well as denying suggestions that the termination took place as recently as 2009.

Sinitta added that she made the decision to have an abortion because she was already aware of health issues that meant she was unable to 'carry a child full term'.

Speaking in an interview with The Sun, Sinitta said: 'Simon was very concerned and by my side. It was upsetting and it was something very difficult that we dealt with together.'

Simon and Sinitta dated on and off for 20 years, but the mother-of-two admitted the termination wasn't something they discussed regularly throughout their friendship.

Firm friends: Cowell and Sinitta dated on and off for twenty years after meeting in the 1980s

The 80s pop star explained
 she helped to deal with her loss by getting a puppy, but that didn't 
stop her still longing to have a child with the X Factor boss.

She added: 'I have always admitted I wanted to marry him and have children with him - not just because I love him, but because I thought it would be good for him.'

Simon is now expecting a child with his American socialite girlfriend, Lauren Silverman, while Sinitta adopted Magdalena, eight, and Zac, seven, with her ex-husband Andy Willner.

However, Sinitta confessed she was both 'shocked and surprised' when Simon called her to break the news that he was set to be a father earlier this year.

She told The Sun's Colin Robertson: 'I was stunned and taken aback, surprised. I was worried about him because he never wanted to have kids and now this was happening. I thought it was a problem initially.'

Sinitta admitted seeing him happy with Lauren has been a 'big adjustment', particularly as she used to consider the 36-year-old brunette as 'like a sister' to her.

But she explained the two women had a chat at Simon's villa in the South of France in August to smooth things over once and for all. 

She added: 'She's in love with him,and he's in love with her. I'm happy for them and I mean that.'

Close friends: Simon and Sinitta dated on and off for 20 years and have remained extremely close ever since

Despite stating that she still loves her former flame, Sinitta insisted she is no longer 'in love' with Simon and wishes the couple 'happiness' for the next 'fascinating' stage of their life together.

Earlier this week, the singer appealed directly to ITV host Jeremy Kyle, offering to take a lie detector test live on air to apparently prove her allegations regarding Simon and their unborn child.

Launching another extraordinary rant on her Twitter page, Sinitta said: 'Jeremy kyle, I know I declined your celebrity chat, but I'd love to do your show PROVIDED you provide a lie detection device.. #thisHAStoEnd.

Big enough to fit nappies!

Despite Lauren Silverman wearing cut off denim shorts and a casual checked shirt, she's really much more of an upper east side lady. Much more Hamptons than Hull. So it's no surprise that her go-to hand bag is this very high end Tom Ford Jennifer shoulder bag.

It is a beauty though isn't it. A sturdy strap, fold over zip section and relaxed slouchy shape make this the perfect winter holdall. She can fit all her essentials in there - lipstick, wallet, Simon' Cowell's cheque book... and when the time comes this will be the most stylish nappy bag ever.

At this time of year it's nice to swap your summer bag out for a more sober and classic black shoulder bag. Forget backpacks and cross body, if you want to channel sophisticated, New York chic then this is the only style to go for. It will look great with everything, from shorts like Lauren to a smart work ensemble.

Tom Ford bags are annoyingly not available over here so we have to head to the states - perhaps a shopping trip to NYC is in order but you can check out Lauren's bag by clicking through to Neiman Marcus (right) or go for a budget option from our alternative styles below.

'A "testimony" is when you tell your story "warts and all" in church or to a group of people, to show your journey from "lost" to "found"...'

The following day, Sinitta took to her Twitter page to post the definition of the word harem, writing: '"Harem". ;- a Group of women kept together for the purpose of having sex with one man...'

On this occasion, Sinitta was of course referring to the group of women made up of Cowell's exes - including Mezhgan Hussainy, Jackie St Clair and Terri Seymour - who regularly enjoy lavish holidays with the music mogul.

A representative for Simon Cowell has been contacted by MailOnline.

While abortion is a harrowing 
experience for most women, doctors said the procedure is no more 
damaging to a patient's mental health than continuing the pregnancy.

The Academy of Medical Royal Colleges published the world's largest, most comprehensive and systematic review of abortion and women's mental health two years ago.

Tracey
 McNeill, Vice President and Director UK and Europe at Marie Stopes 
International said: 'We welcome the findings of this review. It 
reinforces our belief – based on all previous evidence and our 
experience treating 66,000 women a year – that having an abortion has no
 greater effect on a woman’s mental health than continuing with the 
pregnancy.'
