A golden eagle with a six-foot wingspan that could swoop down on a cat if it gets hungry is on the loose in Bedfordshire

The golden eagle, called Norman, was on loan to local falconer Allen Smith when he took flight on January 9.

The bird of prey went missing from Mr Smith's workplace in Flitwick at around 1pm and has already been spotted in the garden of a woman living in nearby Lidlington.

Norman has also been seen in Stewartby.

The 65-year-old falconer added: 'Norman could potentially go for a cat - but not until he was really hungry.

'He had just been fed when he disappeared and he's quite scared of people so I don't think anyone should panic.'

Mr Smith's daughter Mel, 40, added that Norman shouldn't get hungry for about three weeks and said they hoped to find him before he does attack any pets.

Three-year-old Norman stands at roughly three-feet tall and can be easily identified by the leather straps dangling from his feet.

Anyone who spots the bird is asked to call the Royal Society for the protection of Birds on 01767 693690 or Bedfordshire Police on the non-emergency number 101

'He had just been fed when he disappeared and he's quite scared of people so I don't think anyone should panic,' Mr Smith said of the massive bird
