An obscure Welsh folk band thought they were being pranked when they landed the gig of a lifetime, after being booked by the Pentagon to go on a tour of U.S. Air Force bases around the world.

The five friends who play in the Wee Bag Band, a group more well known as an unsigned pub band, will be flown more than 15,000 miles by the Air Force to bases in Cuba, Greenland, Bahamas and Honduras.

Their next stop of the ten day tour will be Cuba, where are flying via military plane from Baltimore to perform for the troops celebrating St. Patrick's day for an undisclosed amount.

The Wee Bag Band from Denbighshire, Wales who have been handed a gig of a lifetime after being booked by the Pentagon to tour far-flung US Air Force bases

Members of the band were stunned when they got an e-mail from U.S. military chiefs asking them to perform for the troops.

Before they agreed, they had to call up the Pentagon to check that they weren't part of an elaborate prank or a con.

All five members of the band, which includes Paul Bassom, Rory McGough, Steve Own, Julian Anderson and Alan Colinson,  have regular day jobs, ranging from motor engineering to computer work.

For years they have been playing Irish music at weddings, pubs and festivals, but now they're taking a tour from Central America to the Antarctic Circle.Â

The band is ordinarily a pub band, and has played at events like weddings and festivals for around five years

Luck o' the Irish: Their brand of music is primarily Irish jig music, which they intend to use to get the members of the U.S. force dancing

Lead singer and IT consultant Rory McGough said: 'The first thing I got was an email from the Pentagon asking if could we come and play some music.

'I thought it was like one of those scams about putting money into a bank account from Nigeria so I was going to put it into the spam folder.

'But I thought I had better check, and low and behold the next thing I am being asked if we could manage to do a week-long world tour!

The trip: Their ten day tour will take them around the world, from sunny Cuba to freezing Greenland

Flying: Beginning by flying from Manchester to Baltimore, then on to the world's destinations

'We seem to have a lot of friends now who play tambourine and would like to tag along.'

The pub band from the tiny rural town of Denbigh, in North Wales, will cover thousands of miles between military bases to play Irish music for the troops.

Their tour will see them fly from Manchester to Baltimore, Baltimore to Greenland, then back to Baltimore before flying to Cuba via Florida.

After playing for the troops in Cuba they fly on to the Bahamas before going back to Florida to fly to Honduras and then to Miami before flying home.

They will be starting off in the remote icy wilderness of Thule in northern Greenland - making them the most northerly gigging band in the world.

McGough said: 'The US Military have told us that when we play at Thule in Greenland we will set the record for the most northerly gig ever played by a British band.

Their music has seen them play in front of crowds of hundreds in large venues, to smaller pubs with only dozens in the audience

Not spam: The band had to check that they weren't being scammed before they took the opportunity, with one member saying 'I was going to put it into the spam folder'

'Also this is the first time the USAF have asked a non-USA band to perform at their bases.

'By all accounts they're really looking forward to it because they've never had anything like it before.

'And of course the Americans have a huge Irish contingency and sometimes celebrate St Patrick's day more than the Irish do.'

After braving Greenland with temperatures of -13F they will be flown by the U.S. Air Force into the 86F heats of Cuba.

Support worker Paul Bassom, who plays guitar and sings in the band, said he was keen to promote dancing among the troops.

The band think that they were selected because some of the U.S. bases have a huge Irish contingency and celebrate St Patrick's day more than the Irish do

Tag along: The Wee Bag Band has noticed they have a lot of friends who 'can play tambourine and want to join us'

He said: 'I've got this image in my head of those old black and white films where all the forces are having the gang show and all sitting in seats.

'We're just going to have to ask them to get rid of a few, aren't we?'

Tin whistle and mandolin player Rory hopes that if it all goes well they could end up playing for the President.

He said: 'You never know, if Barack Obama gives us a shout then we will probably give them a few tunes.'
