A warning over the growing use of CCTV and its sinister potential was issued yesterday by Britain’s surveillance tsar.

Independent commissioner Tony Porter said he was troubled by the public’s lack of concern about how much they were being watched and monitored.

He also warned that the proliferation of spy cameras and their increasing sophistication raised issues of privacy and ‘what sort of society we want to live in’.

Independent surveillance commissioner Tony Porter has said he was troubled by the growing use of CCTV cameras 

Mr Porter said he was nervous about the growing use of technology such as body-worn video, drones and number plate recognition systems, or ANPR, to monitor our movements. 

Police, housing and environmental health officers, landlords, door supervisors, university security staff and even supermarket workers are now wearing state-of-the-art cameras to capture anti-social behaviour on film.

In his first full interview in his role as surveillance commissioner, Mr Porter said: ‘The lack of public awareness about the nature of surveillance troubles me.

‘When people say “the public love CCTV”, do they really know what it does and its capability? Do they know with advancing technology, and algorithms, it starts to predict behaviour? 

'If people are going round with surveillance equipment attached to them, there should be a genuinely good and compelling reason for that.

‘It changes the nature of society and raises moral and ethical issues about what sort of society we want to live in.’

Mr Porter urged public bodies, including the police, to be more transparent about how they are increasingly using smart cameras to monitor people

Fears of yobbish behaviour at an Asda supermarket in Dundee led to security staff being issued with body worn cameras.

Meanwhile, guards at universities, including Newcastle, Essex, Bath and Bangor, have started wearing body cameras and microphones in a bid to reduce crime and fights on campuses.

Mr Porter, a former senior counter-terrorism officer at the London Olympics, told the Guardian: ‘There’s a security argument, but there’s also a personal freedom argument. Have universities been transparent with students and parents?’

He was appointed in March and is responsible for overseeing around 100,000 publicly-operated CCTV cameras out of total of up to 6million surveillance cameras nationwide.

Public authorities and commercial CCTV systems have to comply with a code of practice setting out transparency requirements and a number of measures about how recordings can be stored and used.

But the code does not apply to householders who have installed CCTV on properties to deter burglars and other crime – leading to a 200 per cent surge in complaints about spying neighbours.

Mr Porter urged public bodies, including the police, to be more transparent about how they are increasingly using smart cameras to monitor people.

He warned that spiralling levels of surveillance technology, especially lightweight cameras worn on uniforms, could harm community policing by making the public reluctant to talk if they were confronted with ‘a million pixels up their nostrils’.

He said: ‘It is wrong not to be transparent because it impacts… on the whole psyche of the community. It is very dangerous to walk into a datafied society, where everybody is a number and everybody can be linked via ANPR to facial recognition, to another thing.’

Discussing drones, Mr Porter said: ‘Every time a drone is operating with a surveillance camera attached to it, then the risk of a privacy impact in a public space rises exponentially.’

He also urged who received the hi-tech machines to use them responsibly. He said: ‘You might say “it’s just a toy” but used repeatedly, hovering over a neighbour’s house, is going to cause an issue. You should use it with a great deal of sensitivity.’
