A Victoria's Secret supermodel and her multimillionaire businessman husband are being sued by their landlord after allegedly trashing their $32,000-a-month Manhattan apartment and failing to pay several months' rent.

Julie Ordon, who has also featured in Playboy and Sports Illustrated, and husband David Mimran damaged 'exquisite and valuable antiques, furniture and equipment' in the fully-furnished three-bedroom loft apartment, according to papers filed in Manhattan Supreme Court on Thursday.

The landlord is suing the couple for $420,000, alleging that they failed to pay their last two months' rent at the apartment and underpaid their rent for six months prior to that.

The lawsuit adds that they also made illegal alterations to the unit before leaving in August 2012.

Joshua Price, the attorney for Allerand 
LLC, which owns the building, claims in court papers that the couple 
caused 'unspeakable damage' to the unit, the New York Daily News reported.

He claims they damaged or ruined 'furniture, electronic systems, floor coverings and fixtures, which included many antiques and collectibles'.

'It appears that the damage was was intentional or the result of gross negligence,' the suit says.

The amount he is suing for includes $137,600 in unpaid rent and late fees and interest, $96,000 in lost rent for three months it took to make repairs to the apartment, $153,291 for damage, $4,450 for missing items and $20,000 in 
legal fees.

Ordon, 29, is originally from Switzerland and has appeared in Cosmo, Glamour and the French versions of Elle and Playboy, as well as campaigns for Chanel, Bebe and Guess.

In October 2009, she was photographed pregnant for Vogue Germany and - just months later in 2010, she featured in the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue.

She now lives in Midtown with Mimran, 46, and their four-year-old daughter Mathilda.

'Destroyed': The building's owners are suing the couple, who lived at the Greenwich Street address between 2009 and 2012, for $420,000 - in lost rent, damages, repairs and legal fees

Mimran, who was previously married, is a Swiss-French businessman and movie producer. He signed the lease to the Greenwich Street condo in 2009 as he was going through a divorce.

When he signed the paperwork, he 'agreed to take good care of' the furnishings and 'return them without damage', documents show.

The couple did not respond to a request for comment.
