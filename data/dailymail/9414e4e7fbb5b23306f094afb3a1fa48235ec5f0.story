U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry has arrived in Ukraine for a five-hour show of support for the fledgling government in the country.

Kerry's arrival came as the U.S has formally announced a $1billion energy aid package for Ukraine - a serious indication that it is about to announce economic sanctions against Russia.

The new Ukrainian government ousted President Viktor Yanukovych last week, but almost immediately faced a military takeover of the strategic region of Crimea by Russian forces.

During his visit, Kerry was to pay homage to the dozens of protesters who were killed on February 20 in anti-government demonstrations that days later ousted Ukraine President Viktor Yanukovych.

As he arrived, the White House announced a package of energy aid, training for financial and election institutions, and anti-corruption efforts.

U.S. officials traveling with Kerry also said the Obama administration is considering hitting Russia with unspecified economic sanctions as soon as this week.

The officials added that the U.S. has suspended what was described as a narrow set of discussions with Russia over a bilateral trade investment treaty.

It is also going to provide technical advice to the Ukraine government about its trade rights with Russia.

The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to be quoted by name before the official announcement was made.

Calm: Speaking for the first time since Russian troops effectively took control of the Crimean peninsula, Putin said if 'anarchy' erupts elsewhere in eastern Ukraine, Moscow would have no hesitation in responding

Justified: During the press conference, Putin called the ousting of Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych an 'anti-constitutional coup and armed seizure of power'

Control: A Russian soldier sits on top of a military armoured personnel carrier as they drive on the road from Sevastopol to Simferopol on the Crimean peninsula

Earlier Russian President Vladimir Putin refused to rule out sending troops further into Ukraine, saying he reserves the right to use 'all means' to protect Russian speakers in the country.

Speaking for the first time since Russian troops effectively took control of the Crimean peninsula, Putin said if 'anarchy' erupts in eastern Ukraine, Moscow would have no hesitation in responding.

The comments came during a press conference in which Putin denied Russian troops had besieged Ukrainians based in Crimea, saying it was simply pro-Russian 'self-defence' forces protecting citizens from the 'ultra nationalists' and 'anti-Semites' he said were patrolling streets in the country.

During the news conference, Putin called the ousting of Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych an 'anti-constitutional coup and armed seizure of power'.

He insisted that Yanukovych was still the official president but admitted there appears to be little political future for him in Ukraine, going as far as to say he believes he would have been killed without Russia's 'humanitarian' assistance.

Putin added that he felt the West had encouraged the anti-Yanukovych street protests that put the president's life at risk.

The press conference came as Russian troops in control of the Belbek air base in Crimea fired warning shots into the air as around 300 Ukrainian soldiers, who previously manned the airfield, demanded their jobs back.

About a dozen Russian soldiers at the base warned the Ukrainians, who were marching unarmed, not to approach.

They fired several warning shots into the air and said they would shoot the Ukrainians if they continued to advance.

Tensions: The press conference during a tense stand-off between Russian troops in control of the Belbek air base and around 300 Ukrainian soldiers, who had marched towards them

Shots fired: Troops under Russian command fire weapons into the air and scream orders to turn back

The Ukrainian forces are believed to be led by Colonel Yuli Mamchor, commander of the Ukrainian military garrison at Belbek, who was seen speaking to gun-wielding Russian troops at the air base.

Ukraine's new Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk will meet EU leaders on Thursday ahead of an emergency summit the same day on the crisis in his country, EU President Herman Van Rompuy said.

EU leaders 'will discuss situation in Ukraine with PM Yatsenyuk in Brussels Thursday prior to extraordinary summit,' Van Rompuy said on Twitter this morning.

Earlier in the day, two Russian warships on their way to Crimea passed through Istanbul's Bosphorus straits.

The Saratov and Yamal warships, which are usually based in the Mediterranean, were seen sailing unaccompanied through the Marmara Sea before entering the straits at around 7.30am local time.

At the same time as the Russian warships headed towards the Crimea, a Ukrainian ship called 'Hetman Sahaidachny entered the straits at Canakkale in Turkey.

The head of Ukraine's security service also this morning suggested the country has come under a number of cyber attacks from illegal telecommunications equipment installed in Crimea since Russian troops moved into the region.

Valentyn Nalivaichenko said the mobile phones of lawmakers had been hit by the cyber attacks.

The Kremlin, which does not recognise the new Ukrainian leadership, insists it made the move to protect millions of Russians living in the region, with Moscow's UN envoy adding that ousted president Viktor Yanukovych had asked the country to send troops across the border.

Ukraine has effectively lost control of the Crimean peninsula and admits it has ‘no military options’ to make Moscow withdraw.
