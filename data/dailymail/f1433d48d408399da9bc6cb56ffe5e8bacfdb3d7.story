Princess Diana biographer Andrew Morton has been injured while on his honeymoon in a fatal car crash that killed a woman and baby.

The 58-year-old biographer and journalist suffered broken ribs and his new wife Carolyn, 51, a broken sternum, during the collision on a remote road near Kruger National Park in South Africa.

The couple were on their way to the airport to fly back to Britain after their two-week honeymoon when they collided with another car, 40 miles from the city of Nelspruit in the north east of the country yesterday.

A woman and two-month-old baby in the other car were killed, and another occupant suffered serious injuries and was taken to Matikwane Hospital in Mpumalanga, South Africa.

Mr Morton has written a biography on Princess Diana that was revised after her death in a horrific car accident, and others on William and Catherine, Monica Lewinsky and Victoria and David Beckham.

He was in a vehicle being driven by local driver Johan Scholtz of Tamboti Tours when they collided with a Honda car.

From his hospital bed in South 
Africa, Mr Morton was quoted by the Evening Standard saying: ‘I am well 
under the circumstances. The other people are dead.

Horrible hit: Driver Johan Scholtz who was driving Mr Morton said the other car drove toward them at high speed as he was driving up a steep hill

‘Had my wife and I not been wearing safety belts, we would have been dead.

‘It was a marvellous holiday. We were
 watching lions and a female leopard shortly before hitting the road and
 that horrible accident happened.’

The
 couple were taken to a medical centre at Nelspruit nearby and Mrs Morton 
has since been discharged. Mr Morton remains in hospital for observation.

Driver Mr Scholtz said that he was driving up a steep hill when the Honda drove toward them at high speed.

International success: Mr Morton's biography on Princess Diana was a bestseller after she responded on tape to his questions including her battle with bulimia and heartache over her husband's affair

Secret tapes: Mr Morton wrote a biography on Diana in 1992 based on taped responses Diana gave to his written questions about her life before marrying Prince Charles in 1981 (pictured)

Mr
 Morton wrote international bestseller Diana: Her True Story in 1992 and a revised edition after her death based on taped responses from 
Diana to his written questions.

Those recordings, about seven hours of 
taped responses, were secretly made in Kensington Palace in 1991 during a
 series of interviews conducted through an intermediary.

In the tapes, the princess talks openly about her life before marrying Prince Charles, her long battle with bulimia, her suicide attempts, the heartache over her husband's long affair with Camilla Parker Bowles and her strained relationships with other members of the Royal family.
