Harriet Harman was mocked last night for calling on David Cameron to let her know every time RAF jets took off to bomb Islamist militants in Iraq.

Party sources said the Labour deputy leader made the request at an emergency Shadow Cabinet meeting last week.

It had been called to finalise the party’s position before last Friday’s Commons vote authorising military action against IS fanatics.

One source said: ‘At the meeting, Harriet surprised everyone by saying that she wanted to be kept informed before each raid by British planes.’

Last night, even her party colleagues were quick to brand the request ‘farcical’.

One senior Labour MP said: ‘The idea that someone gives Harriet a ring as our RAF Tornados are given the final order to go into action in Iraq is just bonkers.

‘Once political authority is given for military action, it’s largely down to the military.’

Even Ms Harman's party colleagues have branded her request as 'farcical'

Tory MP Colonel Bob Stewart, ex-commander of UN forces in Bosnia, said: ‘The idea of informing politicians not even in the Government when a military operation is about to take place is daft.’

Last night, a source close to Ms Harman said: ‘She was just concerned that everything should be done to ensure that the bombing did not unintentionally kill civilians.’

Party sources also claimed that Labour peer Lord Wood, a key adviser to Ed Miliband, had urged him to persuade the Government to put a time limit on the military action in Iraq.

A source said: ‘Stewart wanted Labour to insist on a so-called  “sunset clause” on the bombing but he was overruled.’

The Prime Minister last week told MPs that the battle against the Islamist militants could take ‘not months but years’.
