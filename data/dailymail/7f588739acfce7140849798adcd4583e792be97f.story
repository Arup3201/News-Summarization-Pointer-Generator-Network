The Spanish Eurovision Song Contest entrant has been urged not to win because the cash-strapped country can't afford to host the lavish event next year.

Bosses of Spanish public television have told Pastora Soler 'to throw' her entry as the Government battle to cut national debt and bring public spending under control.

The 33-year-old singer said directors of state-run broadcaster TVE called her in to say: 'Please don't win. We don't want to pay for it in 2013.'

Under Eurovision rules, the winning nation must stage the pop contest in their own country the following year.

Soler's song Quedate Conmigo (Stay With Me) is the 28-1 outsider to come out on top in Baku, Azerbaijan, on Saturday with bookmakers William Hill.

Soler, who has had three hit albums in Spain, told ABC Punto radio: 'If we won, I think it would be impossible to stage the next edition because it costs so much money.

'I think it is not the moment, neither for Spain nor for Spanish public, to win Eurovision.'

Spain won the contest in 1968, then again the following year when it shared a four-way tie with the UK, the Netherlands and France.

This year's favorite is Sweden's entry by the singer Loreen at odds of 5-4.

The UK's entrant Engelbert Humperdinck is at odds of 14-1 to win.
