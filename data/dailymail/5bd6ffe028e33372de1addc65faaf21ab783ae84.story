Bad news: The news that the UK is back in recession and the double dip is worse than predicted is a huge blow for Chancellor George Osborne

George Osborne suffered a new blow yesterday after it emerged that the first double-dip recession in Britain since 1975 has been even deeper than previously thought.

Official figures showed that the economy shrank by 0.3 per cent in the first three months of the year.

That is worse than the 0.2 per cent decline initially reported. The slump between January and March plunged the UK back into recession – defined as two quarters of contraction in a row – following the 0.3 per cent fall in output at the end of 2011.

And it is feared that output will fall again in the current second quarter because of the extra bank holiday for the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee.

Britain is trapped in the longest economic downturn for a century, eclipsing even the Great Depression of the 1930s.

One financial analyst described the outlook as 'terrible’ and warned that with the eurozone crisis raging 'the headwinds are turning into a hurricane’.

But as pressure mounted on the Chancellor to kick-start the recovery, the Treasury pledged to stick to its plan to wipe out the record deficit racked up by Labour.

Chloe Smith, Economic Secretary to the Treasury, said the figures were 'disappointing’ and admitted that Britain was in 'a technical recession’.

But she added: 'We need to stick to our path. It would not be acceptable to fail to deal with our debts.’

Labour accused Downing Street of being 'complacent and out of touch’. Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls said: 'What more evidence can David Cameron and George Osborne need that their policies have failed and that they now need a change of course and a Plan B for growth and jobs?’

Wrong: The Treasury had hoped the figures would be revised upwards today but it got worse

The figures from the Office for National Statistics were revised down after construction output crashed by 4.8 per cent compared with the previous quarter, the steepest decline in 11 years.

The uphill challenge faced by the new boss of Mothercare was underlined today as a dismal UK performance dragged the parenting retailer to a £103 million loss.

Presenting his first set of results, Simon Calver, who joined at the end of April, said he would be 'ruthless' on costs as he rolls out a three-year turnaround plan.

The group saw like-for-like sales tumble 6.2% in the year to March 31 in the UK, where it plans to cut store numbers from 311 to 200 by 2015 in a bid to save £13 million a year.

A £55 million writedown on the value of the group’s Early Learning Centre and nearly £10 million in UK restructuring costs triggered a bottom-line pre-tax loss of £102.9 million, compared with an £8.8 million profit the previous year.

Mr Calver, who came to Mothercare from internet movie rental firm Lovefilm, said: 'We have a long way to go, and the plan to bring the UK business back to acceptable levels of profitability will take three years.'

Ministers are looking at using government guarantees to stimulate spending on infrastructure and housing to try to boost the economy.

The ONS report also showed that industrial production fell by 0.4 per cent in the first quarter, factory output was flat and the powerhouse services sector grew by 0.1 per cent.

The slump would have been even worse but for the biggest rise in government spending for four years. It was up 1.6 per cent in the first three months of the year and was driven by spending on health and defence.

James Knightley, a London-based economist at Dutch bank ING, said it 'questions how well the Government is implementing the austerity measures’.

Jason Conibear, director of currency specialists Cambridge Mercantile, said: 'The headwinds are turning into a hurricane.

'The UK economy is in a pretty terrible place right now, and the Greek-fuelled volatility coming in from across the Channel is only going to exacerbate matters in the months ahead.’

Downing Street said that with much of Europe in recession, UK growth was always going to be hard.

* The number of suicides has risen sharply since the recession began.

Some 3,471 suicide verdicts were recorded at coroners’ courts in England and Wales last year.

That was up 7 per cent from 3,252 in 2010 and 15 per cent from 3,007 in 2007, when the credit crunch began to bite.

* Hundreds of thousands of private sector workers are enduring a pay freeze which has lasted for three years, according to a report.

More than a third did not get a rise in 2009 and 2010 and the worst-affected workers have been hit by three consecutive years without a salary boost.

The study by pay experts XpertHR looked at pay deals affecting almost four million private sector workers.

It found that the average pay rise for those who got one was a paltry 2.5 per cent, far below the rate of inflation which is currently 3 per cent.
