With Bolton in talks over a £40million Thai takeover, Neil Lennon’s side continue to show signs of progress on the pitch following a third win in five games under their new manager.

Lennon’s third victory in five games since he replaced Dougie Freedman gives him an identical record to new Cardiff boss Russell Slade, even though it was not enough to lift Bolton out of the Championship relegation zone.

‘It’s the best we’ve played since I came here against a very good side,’ said Lennon. ‘That performance will give the boys a huge lift. We can’t keep going win lose, win lose, we’ve set the standard now.’

A richly deserved Bolton win was built on Liam Feeney’s first goals for the club. The first came in the ninth minute when Darren Pratley made a run from inside his own half and fed Chung-Yong Lee wide on the right. The South Korean’ s low cross into the box picked out Feeney who swept the ball across goalkeeper David Marshall and into the far corner.

Captain Matt Mills had a header cleared off the line by Craig Noone before Feeney grabbed a second goal nine minutes before half-time.

Pratley was involved again in a slick move on the left before clipping a cross to the back post where Feeney squeezed another first-time effort past Marshall from a difficult angle.

He could have completed a hat-trick in the second half after great work by the impressive Craig Davies but blasted well over.

Feeney was replaced by Max Clayton shortly afterwards and it was the substitute who set up a rather fortuitous third goal for Mills in the 76th minute.

Clayton’s low cross from the left picked out his captain 15 yards from goal and his mis-hit shot left Marshall wrong-footed as it bobbled past the keeper and into the far corner.

Without their top scorer Kenwyne Jones, who has been given compassionate leave to return home to Trinidad, Cardiff’s best chances fell to Federico Macheda but he failed to convert and then Andy Lonergan produced an outstanding late save to deny substitute Nicky Maynard.

It left Cardiff still waiting for their first away win of the season and Slade was furious over the way his team succumbed in the first half.

‘I’m bitterly disappointed,’ he said. ‘It was the most disappointing 45 minutes since I’ve been here and I was raging.

‘We were aware that they are strong starters but we lost too many battles in the first half. Some of our decisions were poor and we allowed the ball to come into our box far too easily and got punished for that.

‘In the second period we tried to get back in the game and perhaps if we had got the next goal it would have been a different outcome. But overall Bolton deserved their win tonight.’

It could not be better timed for Wanderers amid the interest from Thailand. Cardiff, under their colourful Malaysian owner Vincent Tan, know all about the ups and downs that could bring.
