Benfica are trying to take Arsenal's Joel Campbell on a loan or a permanent deal.

The Costa Rican is well down the striking pecking order and is open to leaving the Emirates Stadium.

Campbell was hugely impressive at the World Cup in Brazil and scored in the thrilling 3-1 victory over Uruguay.

Benfica have moved in to take him on loan, but may be hampered by the injury to Olivier Giroud which has left Arsene Wenger short of striking options.

Back down to earth: But Campbell has been rarely used by Arsenal since his return to London

Wenger insisted last week that Campbell will stay at Arsenal after resisting repeated attempts by other clubs to take him on loan.

Campbell is only on the fringe of the Gunners' first team with just one substitute appearance so far this season.

But having spent all three years of his Arsenal career on loan at Lorient, Real Betis and Olympiacos, Wenger claimed he still views the 22-year-old as part of his plans.

'We've had lots of enquiries and turned them down. There have been plenty of clubs interested, but I don't know how many,' Gunners boss Wenger said.

'Once I say to my assistant he won't go out on loan, even if people ask about him, my assistant doesn't even tell me. When I say no it's no.

'He's definitely a target and a player who is wanted by many clubs.'
