Daniel Sturridge enjoyed a spot of lunch with his family as the Liverpool star continued his recovery from injury. 

The striker was spotted parking his plush white Ferrari down a side street before heading to a side street in Liverpool city centre. 

And Sturridge enjoyed some more family time in the evening, settling down for a relaxing game of dominoes to celebrate his dad's birthday. 

His uncle - and former Derby striker - Dean was among those present.

Sturridge returned to training at the club's Melwood headquarters this week ahead of schedule after a short injury lay-off. 

Former Chelsea and Man City star Sturridge injured his thigh on international duty with England earlier this month. 

Initial estimates suggested he could be out for up to six weeks, dealing a major early season blow to Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers. 

The Reds struggled in attack without their talisman against Aston Villa in the Premier League and Ludogorets in the Champions League.

Saturday's trip to West Ham is likely to come too soon for the 25-year-old.  

But Rodgers will be delighted last season's 24-goal striker could return for Tuesday's Capital One Cup tie against Middlesbrough - and more importantly next weekend's Merseyside derby against Everton at Anfield. 

The Liverpool boss had been critical of England's handling of Sturridge after picking up an injury.
