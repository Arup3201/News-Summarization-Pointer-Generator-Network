A waitress at a Red Lobster restaurant who was racially abused by two diners on their receipt has received a tip of $10,000 from online supporters.

Toni
Christina Jenkins, 19, was in the middle of her lunchtime shift at the seafood 
restaurant in the affluent Nashville suburb of Franklin, Tennessee, when
the time came to pay the check.

But when the trainee nurse came to clear their table, she says she found one of the customers had not only refused to add a tip to the measly $45 bill but wrote 'n*****' where the total should have been.

Matthew Hanson, founder of 
AddictingInfo.org, was so outraged after hearing about the racist slur against waitress Toni Jenkins that he  
started an online fundraiser called 'Tips for Toni' which raised 
$10,749

Ms Jenkins, working at this Red Lobster restaurant in Franklin, Tennessee, 
was subject to this racists abuse in the tip section of the receipt

Toni Christina Jenkins: So happy to live in the proud southern states..God Bless America, land of the free and home of the low class racists of Tennessee, she wrote

'This is what I got as a tip last night...so happy to live in the proud southern states..God Bless America, land of the free and home of the low class racists of Tennessee,' wrote Miss Jenkins on her Facebook page.

Matthew Hanson, founder of AddictingInfo.org, was so outraged after seeing Miss Jenkins' post he  started an online fundraiser called 'Tips for Toni' which has since collected 
$10,749.

'I literally screamed. I was so confused,' Jenkins said after Matthew presented her with the cheque earlier this month. 'I was just so thankful. I felt so blessed and so honored that so many people came together on my behalf to give this to me.'

Matthew added: 'It was about sending a message 
to racists that Americans aren't going to tolerate that.'

'We raised $10,000 within seventy-two hours. It was really amazing.'

Some online commenters have called the authenticity of the receipt into question, but Jenkins stands by her story.

'I was just trying to create awareness that racism is still taking place in this generation,' Jenkins said. 'For people who think it's fake, my heart goes out to them and I wish them the best.'

Speaking after the September 7 incident to MailOnline, Miss Jenkins said 
that she would never hold a grudge or fake a receipt simply for not 
receiving a tip. 'I don't get tips all the time. I really don't care 
'cause God is my provider I don't worry about tips.'

Miss
Jenkins described the few minutes on Saturday afternoon as she served 
the couple who left the racist receipt as particularly strange.

'They
were extremely rude, but I introduced myself to them and they didn't 
respond. When I came to take their orderm they simply told me they 
wanted their food and to put everything in a to-go box. I offered them 
dessert but they told me abruptly that they just wanted the check.'

'When I went back to the table they had gone and left the receipt and had written the comments.'

The couple were said to be a man and woman in their 20s.

Miss Jenkins said after picking up 
the receipt, she showed it to her manager who reassured her that she had done 
nothing wrong and that she did not deserve such abuse.

Speaking of her decision to post the receipt online, Miss Jenkins said she had been surprised by the reaction.

'It's
all very surprising to me. When I posted it I thought it might get a 
few 'likes' from friends and family. People praying for me, that kind of
thing. I didn't think it would escalate this quickly. I am just a 
19-year-old nursing student.'

The
branch of Red Lobster in Franklin where Miss Jenkins works has now 
suspended the teenager on full pay until they decide what to do next.

Shocked: Toni Jenkins is a nursing student at Belmont University. She told her manager about the racist remark left on the receipt. She has now been suspended from the restaurant on full pay

Virtually all of the comments on the teenagers Facebook page were from friends showing their support for the young woman.

However, some have also cast doubt on the authenticity of the writing.

One doubter commented: 'As a black man, I simply don't believe this is real. The word 'none' has totally different handwriting from the word 'Ni**er.' There's lots of stories lately of people making false accusations of racism or discrimination for attention. I think you should just admit you did this yourself because you were mad he didn't tip you... This poor man is innocent and I think you are racist against white people.'

Strange behavior: Miss Jenkins (pictured) said the couple who left the 
racist comment were acting odd and simply ordered their food in to-go 
boxes before quickly leaving the restaurant

Others have sprung to the server's 
defense stating that she would have been unlikely to have 'faked' a 
restaurant receipt knowing that it would be scrutinized by her close friends and possibly the media.

One
observant poster noted that the two words appeared to be in different 
handwriting styles with the 'N' capitalised on one line, but not on the 
other. The letter 'e' also looked to be different in each of the words.

Nonetheless,
Miss Jenkins, who works two and half days each week at Red Lobster, has
continued to stand by her story, and has encouraged friends and 
acquaintances to 'share' her shocking insult.
