Carol Payne, 32, of Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands, pictured outside Birmingham Crown Court, abused her position to swindle the cash

A treasurer who stole almost £43,000 from a church collection and a school minibus fund and used the cash to pay her child’s tuition fees has been jailed for two and a half years.

Carol Payne, 32, abused her position as a member of the parent-teacher association at Highclare School in Birmingham to swindle £11,552, which had been allocated to buy a bus for the benefit of pupils.

She also took £31,300 from a Methodist church’s collection fund, which was supposed to be used for the benefit of the congregation - among whom were members of her own family.

The fraudster even tricked her own mother-in-law into counter signing cheques from Saltley Methodist Church in order to pay the money into her own account.

Payne, of Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands, used the cash - stolen mostly through numerous cheque payments - to pay the private school fees of her seven-year-old daughter, who attended Highclare, and to fund the rent on her family’s four-bedroom house.

The mother - who was chosen for the treasury role because she had a background in accountancy – pleaded guilty to stealing from Highclare School, as well as further offences of fraud and false accounting in relation to the church at an earlier court hearing.

At a sentencing hearing at Birmingham Crown Court today, Recorder Mark Warby QC told Payne: ‘There’s nothing wrong with aiming high, but you used other people’s money to fund your aspirations.’

He added: ‘It did not take long after you were appointed treasurer at the school, you were dipping the funds being raised for the minibus of children. So it was the children and the parents who were your victims.

‘I accept you took on the role of treasurer at the church with sound motivations, but then still you took £31,300.

‘These are very serious matters - you were given a high degree of trust.

‘You were trusted with money, which was not properly safeguarded, solely because people trusted you.’

The judge handed Payne a 12 month jail sentence for the school theft, with a further 18 months to be served consecutively for the church fraud and 12 months concurrent for false accounting.

He also ordered her to pay a victim surcharge of £100.

Liz de Oliveira, in mitigation, said her client was ‘extremely remorseful’ and had lost everything as a result of her offending.

The barrister said: ‘The impact has been horrendous - albeit all of her own doing.

‘Her family did support her until the church matter came to light, as many of her family attend that church. It has caused a huge split in the family.

‘She’s also lost her house and her child’s education.’

A Proceeds of Crime Act hearing is set to take place this year in a bid to recover some of the stolen cash.
