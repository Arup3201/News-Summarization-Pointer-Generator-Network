The next Prime Minister? Polls show Tony Abbott's Liberal-National coalition heading for a landslide victory

Tony Abbott, leader of Australia's opposition party, looks set to win the country's national election on Saturday ending six years of Labour rule.

Pledging to be 'a leader for everyone' the father of three said: 'If it happens, I will be extraordinarily conscious of the heavy burden of responsibility, of the duties, the extraordinary duties, that will have descended upon my shoulders.'

A Fairfax Media poll on Friday showed Mr Abbott's Liberal-National coalition with a 54 to 46 per cent lead.

However current Prime Minister Kevin Rudd refused to rule his party out, saying: 'There is fight in the old dog yet.

'I believe we can do it. This is not wishful thinking â€“ it's a matter of looking at the maths.'

If Abbott does win, he will have successfully fought off criticism, some of it from within his own party, that he had become unelectable.

A series of high-profile political gaffes over the years had left him unpopular with the Australian public, particularly after being labelled as 'sexist' and 'a misogynist' by the ex-Prime Minister Julia Gillard.

The staunch conservative and monarchist also once listed a female candidate's 'sex appeal' as a political asset, and accidentally drew laughter while saying that nobody is 'the suppository of all wisdom.'

However Bob Hawke, the former Australian Labour prime minister, said Labour's six years in power have been a 'bloody mixed bag' and blamed the party for underestimating Mr Abbott.Speaking to Sky News he said: 'A lot of the Labour party in the last 12 months or so made the mistake of underrating Tony.'

'Tony has historically been capable of some awful gaffes, as people will tell you ... but he's shown considerable discipline in his campaign.'

If Labour are defeated it will mean humiliation for them, having unceremoniously dumped their former leader, and Austrlia's fist female PM, Julia Gillard in the hopes of reviving their appeal.

While Rudd, a mandarin-speaking ex-diplomat, remained consistently ahead of Abbott in the opinion polls until this week, he has failed to reignite his party.

By contrast Abbott has punished Labour's errors at every turn while campaigning on pledges to cut carbon and mining taxes.

He has also promised to take a tougher stance towards asylum seekers arriving by boat, to reduce spending and foreign aid, cut the public service and introduce one of the world's most generous parental leave schemes.

The fitness fanatic and ex-Oxford 
University boxer said that the win, if it comes, would not disrupt his 
morning run, though conceded he would be in for briefings later 'because you can't muck around with something as 
important as the future of our country.'
