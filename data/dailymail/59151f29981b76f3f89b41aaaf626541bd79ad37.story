Model: Caoimhe Gault was found dead in her student home in Dundee. Police are treating the death as 'unexplained'

A part-time model and trainee mental health nurse has been found dead in her student flat. 

Police in Dundee have launched an investigation after the body of Caoimhe Gault was discovered in Scott Street, Dundee, on Friday. 

The 25-year-old was originally from Enniskillen, Northern Ireland, and was studying mental health nursing at Abertay University.  

Her distraught family travelled to Dundee at the weekend to identify her body and a post mortem is now underway.

Her mother, Tara Gault, who works in health and social care, paid tribute to her daughter on social network site Twitter. 

In a series of tweets, she posted: 'Please spare a thought for my daughter Caoimhe Gault who tragically died today, my heart is broken, she was my world.

'My daughter died today, 25, I’ve lost my daughter, friend and soul of my life. 

'She was ready to taken on the world, but it was not to be RIP.

'My beautiful daughter tragically taken from this life 01.03.13. Rest in Peace my angel.'

Miss Gault, who previously took part in the Top Model UK competition and had worked with a number of local photographers, was set to start a new job at a hospital in London in the next few weeks. 

An Abertay University spokesman said: 'The university is very sorry to hear of this tragic death, and our thoughts are with Caoimhe’s friends and family at this difficult time.'

Ms Gault tweeted U.S. television psychiatrist Dr Norman to tell him of her loss and he replied: 'I am very sorry to hear of this. You are in our thoughts... our prayers.'

Miss Gault was born in Londonderry and grew up in Enniskillen, County Fermanagh, Northern Ireland, where her mother still lives.

Stylist Matt Fox, who worked with the Miss Gault said: 'RIP @caoimhegault - lovely girl, will be sorely missed x'

On her own Twitter page, the 5ft 6in model described herself as 'crazy and always up for a party.'

On her modelling profile page, the trainee nurse, who did a degree in forensic science, said: 'I have always loved modelling and being at the modelling competition has made me want to work harder. I am ambitious and a very hard worker.

'I love trying new ideas and am willing to travel to get the best shot.

'I am pretty flexible with travel dates and the only time of year I struggle in from April to September - at these times I need more notice due to nursing placement.

Sandra Cormack, of SC Makeup Artistry, who had worked with Miss Gault, described her as 'a beautiful and intelligent girl'.

She
said: 'It’s just so sad. I put a shout-out out for a retro shoot and 
quite a few girls got in touch, and I picked Caoimhe.

'She was really 
nice, very chatty, bouncy, friendly.

'Her thing was mental health nursing, because that was what she was chatting about. 

'Mental
health nursing was her passion and that is what she loved doing, and I 
think the modelling was something she really loved doing as well.'

A
police spokeswoman said: 'Tayside Police can confirm that we attended 
at Scott Street, Dundee, on Friday March 1 following the sudden death of
25-year-old woman.

'This death is being treated as unexplained and as with all sudden deaths a report will be submitted to the procurator fiscal.'
