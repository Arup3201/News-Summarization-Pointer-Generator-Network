Yorkshire Ripper Peter Sutcliffe may have killed five more women than the 13 victims he is convicted of murdering, it has been claimed.

Sutcliffe, 67, is serving a whole-life sentence for murdering 13 women and attempting to murder seven others during his 1970s killing spree.

But a retired detective believes the serial killer may have attacked at least 20 other women - and killed a further five.

A police document from the Ripper investigation shows Sutcliffe's 13 victims, but a cold case reviewer now believes his death toll could be even higher

Evidence unearthed by cold case 
expert Chris Clark, a former intelligence officer with Norfolk Police, 
also suggests Sutcliffe's rampage began years earlier than previously 
thought.

Mr Clark made the claims after looking into the currently unsolved case of Wendy Sewell, who was beaten to death in 1973.

As
 well as suspecting Sutcliffe of being behind her murder, Mr Clark now 
believes the serial killer may have carried out his first attack as 
early as 1966 - not 1975 as previously believed.

He
 has also linked Sutcliffe to the killings of Wendy Sewell and Barbara 
Mayo in Derbyshire, Judith Roberts in Staffordshire and Rosina Hilliard 
and Caroline Allen in Leicestershire.

Mr
 Clark research into Sutcliffe's activity began when he examined the 
unsolved murder of Miss Sewell, who was hit with a pick axe handle and 
sexually assaulted in September 1973.

Barbara Mayo (left), murdered in 1970, and schoolgirl Judith Roberts (right), killed in 1972, are on the new list of potential Yorkshire Ripper victims

Mr
 Clark said: 'Sutcliffe used to deliver goods for an engineering firm 
and regularly used the M1 and routes across the Midlands.

'I managed to obtain a pathology report that had been buried by the police.

'It says the victim sustained massive bruising to her neck and Adam's apple. This is consistent with being garrotted.

'She was then hit around the head with a heavy object. This is a classic mode of attack by the Yorkshire Ripper.'

Seventeen-year-old cemetery groundsman Stephen Downing was jailed for Sewell's murder, but his conviction was overturned in 2002, after he spent 27 years in prison.

After checking Sutcliffe's logbook and delivery routes as an HGV lorry driver, Mr Clark believes Sutcliffe could gave committed another 22 other attacks nationwide.

He also thinks the Ripper could have killed four other women; Barbara Mayo in Chesterfield, Judith Roberts in Tamworth and Rosina Hilliard and Caroline Allen in Leicestershire.

Student teacher Barbara Mayo, 24, was found raped, battered and strangled in woods at Ault Hucknall, Derbyshire in October 1970. Her killer has never been brought to justice.

Fourteen-year-old schoolgirl Judith Roberts, of Wiggington, Staffordshire was pulled from her bike and beaten to death in June 1972.

Soldier Andrew Evans was jailed for her killing but his conviction was overturned by the Court of Appeal in 1997 and he was released from prison.

Another potential Yorkshire Ripper victim is prostitute Rosina Hilliard, 24, who was found dead at a building site in February 1974.

She had been hit by a car, but a post-mortem examination showed somebody had tried to strangle her. It is unknown whether she was killed by the car or the strangulation.

The last of Sutcliffe's newly-uncovered potential victims is Carolyn Allen, whose remains were uncovered in 1975 near Old Dalby, Leics.

The 17-year-old disappeared the previous year after leaving her home in Bramcote, Nottinghamshire to catch a bus. Her case remains unsolved.

Sutcliffe is now a prisoner at Broadmoor Hospital after being given 20 life sentences.
