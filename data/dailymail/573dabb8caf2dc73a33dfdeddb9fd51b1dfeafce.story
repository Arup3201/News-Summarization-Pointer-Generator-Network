Tough guy: The On Deadly Ground actor teamed up with firebrand Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio to teach civilians how to guard schoolchildren with guns and martial arts

Actor Steven Seagal has launched a stinging attack on critics of his controversial scheme to train armed 'posses' to defend schools from rampaging gunmen, branding them an 'embarrassment to the human race'.

The On Deadly Ground actor has come under fire in recent days after he teamed up with firebrand Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio to teach teams of civilians how to guard schoolchildren with guns and martial arts.

The exercise on Saturday at a closed school site outside Phoenix saw sheriff's SWAT members act as
shooters and 25 teenagers playing the part of students during mock 
scenarios involving up to three gunmen.

But among critics was Arizona Democratic House Minority Leader Chad Campbell, who called the plan 'ludicrous', adding: 'He's making a mockery out of it. You're having a movie actor train people how to protect schools?

'Why don't we also have Clint 
Eastwood and Chuck Norris and Bruce Willis come out and train them too 
while we're at it.'

But Seagal reacted angrily on Saturday, declaring: 'Anybody who has criticized me or the
sheriff for standing up to help the children, in my opinion, is an 
embarrassment to the human race.'

Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, the self-proclaimed 'America's Toughest Sheriff', announced the controversial plan in 
the wake of December's Newtown school shooting that left 27 
people dead, including the gunman and 20 first-graders.

Seagal, best known for his
roles in movies such as Above the Law and Under Siege, led training on 
hand-to-hand defense tactics, among
other techniques, drawing from his expertise in martial arts, according
to a sheriff's office news release.

When faced with criticism in January about the school posse plan, Arpaio
also snapped: 'Why would people complain about my posse being in front 
of schools to act as prevention?'

He boldly announced the plan on the grounds of an elementary school, saying at the time he wanted the patrols publicised.

'I want everyone to know about it for the deterrence effect,' Arpaio 
said, adding that no taxpayer money would be spent on the patrols and 
volunteers will be supervised over the radio or telephone by actual 
deputies.

Campbell, who argues using untrained, armed civilians to protect 
students is a bad idea and likely will only make the facilities more 
dangerous, is not the only vocal critic of Arpiao's protection 
plan.

Randy Parraz, president of Citizens for a Better Arizona, also a 
longtime Arpaio critic, said it's unfortunate the sheriff, known 
nationally for his tough stance on illegal immigration, is using the 
'wake of a tragedy like Newtown' to grab headlines.

'We'd like to think he would take something like this much more 
seriously,' said Parraz, who added that his group planned to be at 
Saturday's event with petitions to recall Arpaio.

The patrols were launched at 59 schools in January throughout 
unincorporated areas and communities that pay Arpaio's agency for police
services.

The sheriff announced this week he needs more members to 
continue the patrols, calling for 1,000 additional citizens to step up 
and volunteer.

Current posse members already are used to bolster the sheriff's office 
force by providing police protection at malls during the holidays, 
directing traffic and transporting people to jail.

Arpaio even sent one group of posse members to Hawaii to conduct an 
examination into the authenticity of President Barack Obama's birth 
certificate.

Joselyn Wells, a mother of three children at a school in suburban 
Phoenix, where Arpaio's posse has begun patrolling, said she was excited
to hear about the initiative.

'A lot of people sit around and watch these things happen, watch key 
signs and no one wants to do anything about it,' she said when Arpaio 
announced the plan. 'Nobody wants conflict, nobody wants to be out in 
the limelight. And he doesn't care. He wants to do the right thing.'

Showboat: Arpaio is running for a sixth term and will challenge former Phoenix police officer Paul Penzone for Maricopa County Sheriff during the general election November 6

Andrew Sanchez, however, a town council member in Guadalupe, said he 
wanted nothing to do with posse members patrolling schools in his 
community, which spends about $1.2 million annually for Maricopa County 
sheriff's patrols.

'We are paying him to have certified deputies here, not to bring a 
circus and not to use our town as a political platform,' Sanchez has 
said.

The volunteers, dressed in uniforms and driving patrol vehicles, some 
authorized to carry guns after training, won't go onto school grounds 
unless they spot danger, but will instead patrol around the facilities, 
Arpaio said.

Seagal is already a volunteer posse member in Maricopa County, and has 
been deputized with sheriff's offices in New Mexico, Texas and 
Louisiana, where a film crew followed the actor on ride-alongs with 
Jefferson Parish sheriff's deputies for the reality TV show 'Steven 
Seagal: Lawman.'

Arpaio says other notable people also have joined his more than 
3,000-strong volunteer armed posse, including The Incredible Hulk star
Lou Ferrigno and actor Peter Lupus of TV's Mission: Impossible.
