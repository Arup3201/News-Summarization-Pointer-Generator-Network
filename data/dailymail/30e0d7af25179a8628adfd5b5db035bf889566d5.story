Wayne Rooney will play through the pain barrier to make Manchester United’s crucial Champions League clash with Bayern Munich in the Allianz Arena on Wednesday night.

It is believed that Rooney might have suffered a chipped bone in his foot in the first leg at Old Trafford – and not a badly bruised toe as first thought – but he will take strong painkillers to play in United’s biggest game of the season.

United boss David Moyes hinted that a painkilling injection was a possibility on Friday after revealing that his 17-goal striker would miss the trip to Newcastle.

‘There is not an awful lot you can do 
with a toe injury,’ said Moyes. ‘Sometimes you can feel better quite 
quickly and sometimes you need an injection possibly to play with it if 
it is bruising.

‘You have to make sure there isn’t a hairline fracture or crack in your toe. We will have all that checked.’

After
 the Newcastle game, Moyes revealed that Rooney was back at Carrington 
doing work in the pool in a bid to be fit for Wednesday’s quarter-final 
in Germany.

He added: ‘We 
have worked him hard on the bike and in the swimming pool, Friday and 
today (Saturday) and we will give him every opportunity to be fit.’

It
 underlines just how desperate Rooney is to play against Munich, despite
 seeing a similar move backfire against the Germans four years ago.

He
 suffered an ankle injury at the Allianz Arena when United last met 
Bayern in the Champions League quarter-finals in 2010, and his 
determination to play in the second leg – eventually limping off after 
55 minutes at Old Trafford – was later blamed for a poor showing at the 
2010 World Cup.
