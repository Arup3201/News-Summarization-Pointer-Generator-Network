Education Secretary Michael Gove hopes to see more schools run by ex-forces personnel

A wave of military-style schools that instil ‘confidence, self-discipline and self-esteem’ in pupils is being proposed by Michael Gove.

The Education Secretary wants groups founding free schools and academies to use former servicemen in lessons.

Cadet Force units – which hold a range of activities with an Armed Forces ethos – could also be opened on school grounds.

He sees it as a solution to the endemic violence in classes and playgrounds, and the rise in expulsions.

Details emerged the day after a secondary school staffed by ex-servicemen and women was unveiled as one of more than 100 free schools due to open next year.

Phoenix Free School of Oldham, whose head of studies was a Tornado pilot before taking charge of the science department at an independent school, will have a zero-tolerance approach to bad behaviour.

A research paper, released by the Department for Education, said: ‘The Government is interested in exploring how academies and free schools can use their freedoms to foster a military ethos and raise standards.’

The department says it would help ‘foster confidence, self-discipline and self-esteem whilst developing teamwork and leadership skills’.

Free schools can be set up by groups including parents, teachers, businesses or faith organisations and are government-funded but independent of local authorities.

This gives them a greater say in areas such as curriculum, teachers’ pay and the length of terms or days. A total of 102 were approved this week by Mr Gove, taking the overall number to nearly 300.

The latest additions will create 50,000 places, according to the DfE – addressing some of the 250,000 shortfall next year identified by the National Audit Office.

However, the vast majority of the places needed are in primary schools, while only 33 of the new free schools are primaries and 11 ‘all through’ schools, which teach pupils aged four to 19.

Discipline: Drills and teamwork could become a common sight in military-style free schools after the first of its kind was given the go ahead

The Troops to Teachers programme re-trains ex-servicemen and women to enable them to take lessons in schools. Just over 250 applied to the scheme between March 2011 and October 2012.

Phoenix Free School denies that it will be ‘like a boot camp’. Its website says teachers will ‘embody the Army’s core values of moral courage, self-discipline, respect for others, integrity and loyalty’.

Critics say free schools are damaging the state system by taking money and pupils from other schools and being allowed to open in areas where places are already available.

But Mr Gove said: ‘Free schools are extremely popular with parents and are delivering strong discipline and teaching excellence.’
