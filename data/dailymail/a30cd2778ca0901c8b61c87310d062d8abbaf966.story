Mike Zimmer says the Minnesota Vikings have no intention of trading Adrian Peterson.

But the player and his agent have other ideas.

'We're planning on him being back. We have no plans to trade Adrian,' he said.

'We're good to go. I mean, he's under contract and we expect him to honor it,' Zimmer said at the NFL Annual Meeting. 'I think when he goes into the Hall of Fame, he's going to want to go in with the jersey that everyone remembers him as. That will be as a Viking.'

Adrian Peterson played one game for the Vikings last season before being suspended 

But Ben Dogra, agent of the superstar running back, has other ideas.

'Adrian and I feel it is in his best interest, and it would be his desire, to play elsewhere in the NFL. This is not personal in any way, it is business,' he told the Associated Press.

Three years remain on the 30-year-old's deal with $12.75million due this season. None of the money is guaranteed.

Peterson remains on the Commissioners Exempt List until at least April 15 after hitting his four-year-old son with a switch and the 2012 MVP has been less than enthusiastic about returning to Minnesota.

Zimmer also poured scorn on notions that the Vikings are set to trade 2013 first round draft pick Cordarrelle Patterson.

The eccentric receiver and returner made the Pro Bowl after his first year in purple, but found himself sidelined with the emergence of Charles Johnson and his inability to run routes.

'No, no chance whatsoever,' Zimmer told 1500ESPN.com. 'Cordarrelle is a young, emerging player who was with his third coordinator in three years. Quite frankly, we need to do a good job of figuring out how we can use him better and he needs to understand where he's supposed to be, the routes and everything.'
