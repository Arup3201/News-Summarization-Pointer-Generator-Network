Britain's property-owning democracy is  collapsing and half the country will be in rented accommodation in a generation unless urgent action is taken, according to the head of a government housing review.

Owner-occupiers make up 65 per cent of householders, down from a peak of 71 per cent a decade ago.

But housing expert Natalie Elphicke said on current trends, just 55 per cent were likely to own their homes by 2033, falling to 49 per cent by 2041.

Margaret Thatcher’s housing revolution is being reversed as property prices spiral, with the number in private rented accommodation up from  2.2million in 2002-03 to nearly 3.9million last year. Mrs Elphicke said the explosion in the buy-to-let market and the growth in demand because of a rising population had created ‘generation rent’ as more people had to turn to private landlords.

But without reform, ‘generation rent’ would become ‘nation rent’ as the dream of a property-owning democracy was shattered, she said.

The founder of the charity Million Homes, Million Lives, which wants a million extra properties to be built, Mrs Elphicke said more than three quarters of those in private rented housing and nearly half in social rented housing wanted to buy their own homes.

Just
 3 per cent of people choose long-term renting as their first choice. 
The trend towards private renting is blamed for undermining communities,
 with more transient families who do not stay long enough to put down 
roots.

Many families with children now pay half or more of their income in rent and have little or nothing left at the end of the month to save for a deposit.

In a report next week, Mrs Elphicke is to call for a revolution in the financing of housebuilding that would encourage City investors, insurers and pension funds to bankroll affordable developments.

Treasury Chief Secretary Danny Alexander and Communities Secretary Eric Pickles have appointed Mrs Elphicke and Keith House, the Liberal Democrat leader of Eastleigh Council, to lead an independent review into the issue.

Mrs Elphicke said: ‘It needs to be possible for people to buy their homes as their circumstances allow. It would be wrong to allow the current trends to continue.’

More than a third of England’s 14.3million homeowners are aged 65 and over. Just 1.4million homeowners are aged between 25 and 34, the age group most likely to be raising families.
