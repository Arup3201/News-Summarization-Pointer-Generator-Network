Across the globe, text slang is the bane of any teacher's life.

But this Chinese college claims to have found a simple solution.

Using makeshift canvas 'phone lockers', teachers now order pupils to deposit their mobiles before class starts, in a desperate bid to stamp new 'modern' words out of exam papers.

Confiscated: Pupils are now phoneless in class at Luoyang Institute as they must deposit mobiles in these holders

Incredibly, pupils have taken to the system with glee - teachers claim.

It may be a move worth considering by heads of schools in Britain, as hundreds of teachers continue to complain about students' diminishing language skills.

Last month, a poll of 500 teachers in England and Wales found that many youngsters used colloquialisms in formal written work, with phrases such as 'Macbeth was pure mental' and 'Romeo was a numpty wasn't he?'.

According to Zhao Jianli, dean of the Luoyang Institute, the simple fabric hangers have made all the difference.

The lockers were introduced at the Luoyang Institute of Science and Technology, in Henan, China, after teachers said 'most pupils' were on Weibo (Chinese Facebook) 'most of the time' during lessons.

Zhao Jianli, dean of the institute, said the 'visible reminder' encourages a 'studying atmosphere'.

Zhou Jianli, dean of the college, said pupils are delighted with the system aimed at correcting their language

The school brought in the 'lockers' as they claimed phones were a danger to pupils' health and intelligence

She added: 'One only needs to look at the
 new words that are coming up to describe the distractions the kids are 
having, for example Phone Freak for someone who is obsessed with the 
phone or Phubbing, which is snubbing the teacher by messing around on 
the phone.

'We feel that this is damaging the kids development and also causes health problems.

'By having a very visible reminder as they walk into each class that when they start their studies they leave their phones behind, it has really helped improve the studying atmosphere within the school.

Despite initial complaints, pupils now 'love' the system, which stops them messaging during lessons

'The teacher has clear sight of the 
phones as well and watches when the phones are taken and collected at 
the beginning and end of each lesson to avoid any problems.'

She added: 'I am not even convinced that having a class filled with 30 people and 30 phones and all giving off electro smog is particularly safe, I am sure it affects the ability to concentrate.

'The reaction has been great from the students, and although at the start there were some instances where people seemed to forget to switch off their phones everyone now seems to have it correct - and it's routine.'
