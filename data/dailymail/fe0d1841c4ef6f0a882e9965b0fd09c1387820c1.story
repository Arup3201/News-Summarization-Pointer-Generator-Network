Parents as well as children have been struck by Frozen fever, as a new UK baby name poll sees Elsa enter the list of most popular names for the first time.

And it looks like Eric really does have the X Factor, with the name leaping up 284 places since pop mogul Simon Cowell announced the name of his child back in February.

Inspired by the Disney animation, which has seen people all over the globe left with that song stuck in their heads, the poll by pregnancy and parenting website BabyCentre revealed a 243 increase in babies named Elsa since 2013.

‘Whilst the film’s popular heroine is called Anna, Elsa offers a more unique name and is also a strong female role model’, says managing editor Sarah Barrett.

‘Elsa is the ice queen but she sees the error of her ways and is shown to be a sensitive, but strong and confident character. Just in the way the name Arya from Game of Thrones increased in popularity in 2013, films are hugely influential.’

In fact, the name has proven so popular that children have been demanding it be bestowed on new siblings.

However, while Elsa, taking the 88th spot, and Eric, placing 118th, have a new-found popularity, parents are still choosing old favourites for their children, with Emily and Oliver bagging the top spots for little girls and boys.

Old-fashioned names are a firm favourite among parents, with Penny, Audrey, Edith, Bertie, Ronnie and Albert ranking high.

Unexpectedly, it looks like the gorgeous baby prince is serving as a deterrent when it comes to naming our children, with George moving down to number 19. This is the lowest it has listed since 2000, suggesting parents are put off by the idea of being seen to copy the third in line to throne.

Down with the kids: William and Harry have remained popular names for boys

However, other royal names are still a popular choice, with Harry placing third and William coming in 10th for boys.

Some 30,140 Mums took part in the survey to see which 200 boys and girls names have proven most popular in the first half of 2014.

However, Sarah expects the list will continue to change as we hear the pitter-patter of tiny celebrity feet.

Films are a big influence too, with Logan – the real name of X-Men Character Wolverine – and Noah – Russell Crowe’s title role in the recent biblical epic – placing 14th and 4th respectively.
