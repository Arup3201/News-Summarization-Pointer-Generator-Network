She's often declared her intention to be seen as more than a political wife in a pretty dress but that hasn't prevented Justine Miliband from upping her style game in recent years.

Indeed, Mrs Miliband's most recent appearance in Manchester saw her cut a stylish figure as she took to the stage, resplendent in a trendy £59.99 cerise dress from high street favourite, Zara.

True to her independent style, the 44-year-old's new look is all her own work, with Labour sources keen to point out that she chooses all her own clothes and has resisted calls to get a stylist.

Not, it seems, that she needs it, for gone are the dated, unflattering frocks of four years ago and in their place, a wardrobe of neat, tailored shift dresses that wouldn't look out of place on the Duchess of Cambridge.

But while they might look expensive, much of Mrs Miliband's wardrobe comes from carefully chosen high street brands, with Zara and Topshop bulking out a smattering of designer names.

Yesterday saw her take to the stage to defend her 'principled' husband in a chic emerald green silk shirt and the sort of flattering cropped trousers regularly spotted on Samantha Cameron.

Other highlights of her sartorial career so far include the chic £245 Bassey Jacquard dress and nude L.K Bennett 'Sledge' shoes worn to last year's Labour conference in Brighton and the stylish geometric-print cigarette pants worn to cast her vote at Doncaster Town Hall in May.

Equally well-received was the punchy crimson dress by Scottish eco-designer Henrietta Ludgate worn by Mrs Miliband during Labour's 2012 Manchester conference.

Arguably though, it was her stunning Alice Temperley wedding gown that truly propelled her onto the style scene after years of unflattering black.

Not that she's immune to the odd slip-up, as the Cherie Blair style salwar kameez worn to the Asian Women of Achievement Awards in June made plain.

But, like fellow political WAG (and reluctant leader's wife), Miriam Clegg, Mrs Milliband has developed a punchy style that rarely looks dated and is always appropriate.

She might want to be seen as 'more than just a dress' but the environmental lawyer is doing an excellent job of ensuring her glamorous looks are as talked about as her husband's speeches - and usually far more positively.
