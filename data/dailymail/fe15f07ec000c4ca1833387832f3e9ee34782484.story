Confirmation: The human remains found under a car park in Leicester are expected to be confirmed as belonging to Richard III

A skeleton thought to be Richard III, discovered underneath a car park in Leicester, was found after a women had a hunch that he was buried there.

Screenwriter Philippa Langley said she felt a chill on a hot summer's day as she walked through the area where it was thought he was buried.

The remarkable discovery of the remains, entailing a curved spine back and wounded skull, was made last September.

The skeleton is expected to be confirmed as that of Richard III - one of England's most controversial kings.

Miss Langley was strolling across the car park used by Leicester social services while researching a play about the king when she felt a chill in August 2009.

According to The Sunday Times, she said: 'It was a hot summer and I had goosebumps so badly and I was freezing cold. I walked past a particular spot and absolutely knew I was walking on his grave.

'I am a rational human being but the feeling I got was the same feeling I have had before when a truth is given to me.'

Miss Langley initially funded 
the excavation of what is now a Leicester City Council car park because she was '99 per cent certain' that the remains were those of Richard.

Since then scientists have been conducting a range of tests to establish whether the remains do indeed belong to the Plantagenet King.

Researchers from Leicester University will hold a press conference on Monday morning where they will present the findings of their investigation.

The scientists will present the results of carbon-dating tests and a DNA investigation, pairing the skeleton's genetic material with that of Michael Ibsen.

Felt a chill: Screenwriter Philippa Langley said she 'absolutely knew' Richard III was buried in a car park in Leicester when she felt goosebumps on a hot summer's day

Mr Ibsen, a London-based furniture-maker, is a direct descendant of the medieval king's sister, Anne of York.

Reports suggest that the scientists will also confirm the body was not buried within a coffin or shroud.

Richard
 III died during the Battle of Bosworth in 1485, becoming the last 
English king to die on the battlefield, and is thought to have been 
crudely buried by his successor Henry VII.

The body in the car park has an arrow in its back, matching details of his death in the battle.

The skeleton's scoliosis – severe curvature of the spine – ties in with the 
famous description by Shakespeare and others of the monarch as a 
hunchback.

However, those working on the project previously said these details were not enough to prove that the skeleton was Richard.

Miss Langley is working on a documentary charting the excavation for Channel 4 titled Richard III: 
The King in the Car Park, which has been made alongside the university 
academics and will be screened on Monday night following the press 
conference.

Previous reports suggested that 
academics withheld evidence during press conferences to 
generate publicity for the documentary, much to the annoyance of some 
involved in the project.

Langley, who is a member of the Richard III Society, said a play that she began 
researching three years ago has been turned into a script for television
 and film.

She told the Sunday Times the scripts are now 'getting serious interest from Los Angeles and in the UK'.

The new evidence will also include tartar analysis from the skeleton's teeth.

Once it is confirmed that the body is
 Richard III, it is believed the remains will be buried inside Leicester
 Cathedral - more than 500 years after he was killed in battle.

The
 decision, made by the Ministry of Justice, came after a row between MPs 
as to where Richard should
 be laid to rest.

Some said he should be given a state burial in Westminster Abbey because he was a reigning monarch.

Others said the remains should be buried in Worksop, Nottinghamshire, the centre of the Plantagenet monarch’s kingdom.

But in a parliamentary answer, the Government settled for Leicester Cathedral, a stone’s throw from the car park.

Jon Ashworth, Labour MP for Leicester
 South, said at the time: ‘This is really good news. Richard III has 
been lying in Leicester for 500 years – it seems only appropriate that 
he should be buried in Leicester'
