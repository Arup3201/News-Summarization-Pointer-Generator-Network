Fire starter: Matthew Heckler holding Zeus who chewed through a can of deodorant which caused an explosion

A six-month-old puppy chomped through a can of deodorant which caused a window-shattering explosion.

The saluki greyhound cross called Zeus chewed through the can of Lynx and caused a blast so intense that it shattered his owner's double glazed bay window, broke the floorboards and set fire to the sofa.

Kerry Leech, 20, and her partner Matthew Heckler, 22, said they were lucky not to have been in during the freak accident at their home in Goldthorpe, South Yorkshire, on Saturday.

Firefighters first told the couple that the explosion must have been caused by leaking gas pipes.

But after no evidence of a leak was found, they now believe that Zeus chewed through the deodorant can right next to the home's back boiler, located directly behind the living room fire.

When the central heating came on just minutes later, a spark ignited the gas and caused the explosion.

Mr Heckler, who is currently unemployed, said: 'I didn't even know we had a can of Lynx in the living room. 

'It was a Christmas present from Kerry's parents and was in a gift box underneath a table - right next to the fire and back boiler.

'It is just one of those awful coincidences I suppose - moments after Zeus chewed through the can, the back boiler must have ignited.

'Poor old Zeus is lucky he didn't chew that can a few minutes later or he'd probably be dead now.'

Miss Leech said: 'We had only left the house 10 minutes before the explosion.

'But while we were out we received text from our neighbour saying our house had blown up, then we were told the living room window had blown out.

'I was panicking about our pets so we rushed back. When we got there we saw flashing lights, two fire engines outside the house, the street was blocked off and there were so many people on the street having a look what was going off.

'We thought someone had put something through the letterbox or there had been a gas explosion.'

Mr Heckler added: 'When we got inside the house we saw that the explosion had completely smashed out our bay window.

'It had also cracked the fireplace, all the floorboards underneath the explosion had been destroyed, and the sofa is completely ruined - we have had to buy a new one.

'All I could think about was our pets - thankfully they were okay.'

The damage caused by the explosion is estimated to be around £2,000.

The couple's three dogs, Zeus, a two-year-old saluki collie whippet called Sonic and a 15-month old saluki collie greyhound called Vinnie as well as three cats - Mittens, Felix and Bow, were in the house but escaped unharmed.
