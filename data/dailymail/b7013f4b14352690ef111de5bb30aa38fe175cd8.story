A coroner said Louis Holford may have contracted leukaemia as a result of radiation exposure on Christmas Island

A nuclear test veteran who died after contracting leukaemia may have gotten the cancer from being exposed to dangerous levels of radiation as a serviceman, a coroner has ruled. 

Louis Holford, 71, had a number of health problems through his life after he witnessed atomic bomb blasts on Christmas Island, near Indonesia, in the Pacific Ocean, in 1958.

The Ministry of Defence has never admitted fault, but a coroner ruled this week that his death may have been caused by the exposure.

Father-of-two Mr Holford was adamant 
that his cancer - as well as two strokes and thyroid problems - had been
caused by toxic fallout.

He 
and 31 other servicemen launched High Court action against the Air Force
in 2007 for negligence. They claimed they had been used as ‘guinea 
pigs’.

But the test cases were thrown out, with judges saying the veterans had lodged their claims too late.

Mr
Holford, who died while undergoing intensive treatment for acute myloid
leukaemia following a fall in 2009, never saw a verdict reached.

But a coroner has ruled that his condition could have been caused by his exposure to radiation.

North Staffordshire coroner Ian Smith branded the nuclear tests ‘appalling’ and said Louis must have been exposed to unnatural levels of radiation.

Recording a verdict of accidental death yesterday, Mr Smith said he could not rule out a link between Mr Holford’s condition and his experiences in the Pacific Ocean.

But he said he would leave it to ‘others to deal with the tricky issues’.

The coroner said: ‘What happened on Christmas Island was an appalling and inhumane process with potentially devastating effects to those exposed.

‘That was then, however. Times are very different but, even so, it seems very hard to justify.

‘In Mr Holford’s case, his acute myloid leukaemia could have been or could not have been caused by his exposure.

‘The most obvious cause of death was a fall leading to a head injury potentially brought about by AML and potentially exacerbated by his AML.’

Giving evidence, wife Geraldine, 74, told the inquest RAF clerk Mr Holford and thousands of others were ordered to watch A-Bomb and H-Bomb blasts without protective clothing.

She said: ‘They had to sit with their backs so they weren’t facing it. They were told to put their hands over their eyes and not to look. There were five bombs in total.’

She also blamed the exposure to radiation for three miscarriages she suffered after the couple married in 1961.

Mr Holford was within 20 miles of three H-Bomb and two A-Bomb explosions when he spent six months at the RAF HQ on Christmas Island.

Speaking in 2009, the retired office manager described the ‘spectacular’ bomb tests which he had watched as a 20-year-old.

He said: ‘At the time, without knowing everything that happened since, it was quite a spectacle.

‘You heard the plane coming over, then we had to turn away from the bomb site with our hands over our eyes.

‘Ten seconds after the explosion someone said we could open our eyes and turn round.

‘It was like a bright new sun, then the dust formed a cloud and you could feel the heat.

‘When one bomb went off the wind veered towards us and we had to get on to a landing craft and go out on the water.

‘There was never any mention of possible dangers.’

Around 22,000 men are thought to have witnessed nuclear blasts between 1952 and 1967, with 3,000 surviving today.

Of those that remain, it is thought around three will die each month.

In March last year the Supreme Court ruled on ten test cases lodged by Christmas Island veterans who witnessed nuclear tests in the Pacific.

The court found nine of the claims, brought against the MoD in 2009, had been entered too late and threw them out of court.

A spokesman for the MoD said: ‘The MoD recognises the debt of gratitude we have to the servicemen who took part in the nuclear tests.

‘The Supreme Court ruled in favour of the MoD that the claims brought by Nuclear Test Veterans were time barred and declined to allow the claims to proceed under the statutory discretion.’
