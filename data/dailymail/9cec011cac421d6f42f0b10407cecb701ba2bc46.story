The NRL superstar is set to make the switch to the American football, although he has not signed a contract yet

The legendary fullback choked up and dabbed his face with a handkerchief as he said his aim had only ever been to buy his mother a house, something he has since achieved.

Despite rumours otherwise, Hayne has not signed a contract with an NFL side.

'I’m always telling people to chase their dreams and follow their hearts, if I don’t live by that I’m not being honest with myself,' said Hayne, who has played for the Eels since he was 13. 

Some fans expressed mixed emotions about the decision.

He denied he was considering a sensational switch during an interview with Triple M on October 2.

'(NFL is) a great sport and I've got a lot of respect for it,' he said, adding that he had never really considered switching codes.    

And in recent weeks, Hayne's Twitter feed has been filled with memes and commentary about American football. 

Hayne had just completed his best season, lifting the Eels from the wooden spooners in 2013 to just outside the top eight.

He also played a crucial role in helping NSW win the State Of Origin series for the first time since 2005 and was awarded the Dally M medal as the best player in the game.

Dear Blue and Gold Army,

For the past 24 months I’ve been thinking about having a crack in the NFL, and over the last 12 months I’ve been seriously considering it.

Today I can officially announce that I will be heading to the United States to pursue an opportunity to play American Football.

I will be withdrawing from the Kangaroos Four Nations side immediately, and accepting a conditional release from the Eels to make the move overseas.

The reason I didn’t make this decision any earlier was because of the part I played in getting Brad to the club and the way we finished the season. I felt I owed the Club one more year and I gave it everything I could.

It’s always been a dream of mine to play in the NFL, and at my age, this is my one and only chance at having a crack at playing there.

I’m excited about the potential opportunities that lie ahead. I’ve known the deadline has been looming for me to make this call, and I believe the right time is now.

I’m so passionate about the challenge that lies ahead for me, not only as an athlete but more so as a person. It’s the hardest decision I have ever had to make in my life. I’m leaving my teammates, friends, and most importantly my family; but for me to grow as an athlete and a person I feel this is the right step to take.

It hasn’t been an easy decision for me to leave the Eels, the club’s been my home and family since I was 13, and I’ve always been proud to pull on the Blue and Gold jersey with my teammates.

The hardest thing about leaving the club is there’s stability for the first time in a long time, but I know where my heart lies and I’m following that.

I’m always telling people to chase their dreams and follow their hearts, if I don’t live by that I’m not being honest with myself.

I'm leaving knowing that I have signed a ‘lifetime agreement’ with the Eels, so if I return to the NRL, it will be to Parramatta.

I'm grateful to all of you for the support you've shown me at this club, thank you.
