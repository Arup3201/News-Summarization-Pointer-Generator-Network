Tragic: The body of Shjon Brown, 9, pictured, who fell down a 200-foot crevasse in Alaska on the weekend has been found buried under six to eight feet of snow

The body of a nine-year-old boy who fell down a 200-foot crevasse in Alaska on the weekend has been found buried under six to eight feet of snow.

Officials believe Shjon Brown, from Fairbanks, died after he crashed his snowmobile through a glacier on Saturday in the Hoodoo Mountains of Alaska.

Rescue workers recovered Shjon's body at around 12:40 a.m. on Monday, Alaska State Troopers spokesman Megan Peters confirmed.

'Recovery workers reported that his 
body was located buried in six to eight feet of snow underneath the snow
machine,' she said, according to the Los Angeles Times.

Recovering the boy's body was difficult because of the depth of the hole and the condition of the ice.

Rescuers
were required to rappel into the crevasse and search the bottom where 
the boy's goggles and helmet were seen, along with the snowmobile.

Crew members of the Army's Alaska Northern Warfare Training Center descended 145 feet so that they could get to the 15-foot space inside the glacier on Sunday.

Hard work: They shoveled 3,000 pounds of snow which was then packed into bags and lifted it to soldiers above

Sad outcome: They were not expecting to find the boy alive, and they did end up finding his body

The group of men shoveled 3,000 pounds of snow which was then packed into bags and lifted it to soldiers above.

Only after doing so, they found the body of Shjon.

His body will be transported to the State Medical Examiner's Office in Anchorage for autopsy.

The young snowmobile racer had been 
riding the machine with his father at the Arctic Man Classic and Sno-Go -
a major snowmobile and ski race in the Hoodoo Mountains in central 
Alaska.

The boy's father stopped on a hillside to watch his son as he rounded a snow mound and disappeared.

When the father went looking for the boy he found that Shjon had fallen into a deep hole in the glacier, the Fairbanks Daily News-Miner reports.

Such holes - called mulans - can spring 
open in glaciers when water welling up from a spring melts away the snow
beneath the surface.

A trained climber rappelled down the hole and found Shjon 's goggles and snowmobile, though there was initially no sign of the young boy.

Authorities were assisted by a team from the U.S. Army Black Rapids-Northern Warfare Training Center to recover the body.Â 

The tragic accident occurred about five miles north of the Arctic Man Classic, where snow enthusiasts, using skies, boards and snowmobiles were competing on the weekend.
