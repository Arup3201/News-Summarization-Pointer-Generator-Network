Mathieu Debuchy has revealed he did not think twice about quitting Newcastle United for Arsenal – insisting he has moved to 'another world'.

The France defender joined the Gunners in a £12m deal this summer having signed for the Magpies from Lille for £5m just 18 months earlier.

Debuchy was part of the side which lifted the Community Shield with victory over Manchester City last weekend and is set to make his Premier League debut at home to Crystal Palace on Saturday.

And the 29-year-old says his new club is in a different league to Newcastle.

'It was the right time for me to make this big step forward and this big move,' he said.

'When my agents told me Arsenal were interested, I said yes straight away. There was no question, no debate, no doubt, nothing.

'You don’t turn down a club like Arsenal. A lot of players would like to be in my shoes right now.

'This is another dimension. If you compare the training grounds for example, nothing at Lille or Newcastle can match the Arsenal one. It is another world.

'Everything here is made to optimise your preparation and you as a player. So you can be in the best condition to play and win football games.

'This was the perfect move for me to continue to improve and to win trophies too.'
