England embark on 12 months crammed with cricket, knowing they still have much to do to show they have fully recovered from a year that ripped them apart.

The tumultuous events of 2014, culminating with the sacking of Alastair Cook as one-day captain, give way to a non-stop diet of high-profile competition that will make or break their still unproven regime.

Peter Moores left Heathrow on Tuesday with the prospect of his second coming as England coach being defined by how they fare during a year that includes a World Cup, the Ashes and series against Pakistan and South Africa.

Only if England make significant progress in the months ahead will the jury that is still out on both Moores and managing director Paul Downton return a favourable verdict on the massive changes that have swept through the game. The green shoots of recovery that saw England win three Tests against India must now blossom if the fallout which claimed Andy Flower, Ashley Giles, Kevin Pietersen and, in one-day cricket at least, Cook, is to prove justified.

England, who left for Canberra on Tuesday and a pre-World Cup triangular series against Australia and India, are not expected to make much of an impact in the 50-over game.

Yet if a mediocre World Cup — and they really should make at least the quarter-finals — is followed by stuttering form in the Caribbean and beyond, then the rancour that has enveloped them since their Ashes debacle will claim more victims.

Moores, who has had to take over on the back of two 5-0 thrashings by Australia, travels with England still adamant that they have the ‘outstanding coach of his generation’ at the helm for their busiest-ever year.

The World Cup warm-up in Australia is the start of a busy 12 months and those who play in all formats will be away from home for an incredible 321 nights.

Yet their backing for Cook, both publicly and privately, was total until they ruthlessly cut him adrift after the 5-2 one-day defeat in Sri Lanka so a vote of confidence in Moores will only stretch so far into the challenges ahead.

Moores believes England travel with expectation as well as hope in their hearts.

‘We are going to Australia to win it,’ he said. ‘We know 2014 was tough, with the highlight of winning three Tests in a row against India, but we’ve not had a move forward yet in one-day cricket. We will attack the tri-series and the World Cup with a view to making the public excited about watching England play. This trip will be about England winning and not us making excuses.’

This one-day venture will certainly be a tall order. Three and a half years of planning were ripped up when Cook was jettisoned at the last moment and replaced as skipper by a batsman in Eoin Morgan who is in even worse one-day form.

Moores insisted Cook was the right man for the job right up to the fateful selection meeting last month when it became clear that the man in whom England have invested so much had finally run out of one-day chances.

‘The goal we set going back eight months was to have the best 15 players going to the tri-series and then the World Cup. I think we’ve got that, but unfortunately for Alastair he missed out at the last part of that,’ said Moores.

‘It’s a tough one on Alastair, but we can look back and say he had every opportunity to try to get himself on the plane. Plans are there to be changed at times. We’d got to a position where it felt like the right thing to do.’

The scale of England’s task is summed up by the fact that four players who could feature in their first-choice top six — Alex Hales, Moeen Ali, James Taylor and Gary Ballance — have 37 one-day caps between them while a key figure for group opponents Sri Lanka in Mahela Jayawardene has almost 400 more on his own.

Yet England changed tack late before their 2010 World Twenty20 victory and their chances of causing an upset this time cannot really be harmed by the promotion of a canny captain in Morgan. ‘It will be exciting to work with Eoin and I think he’ll bring a lot to the team,’ said Moores.

It is fascinating to ponder how many England players will still be standing this time next year after a gruelling schedule put together by greedy administrators with no thought for the well-being of players nor the quality of the product that spectators pay good money for.

Yet Moores was bullish about 12 months that Stuart Broad for one calculates will see him spend 321 nights in hotel rooms if he somehow manages to stay fit for all the cricket that lies ahead.

‘My message to the players is let’s go for it, get in there and play good, hard cricket,’ said Moores. ‘And let’s enjoy representing our country.

‘That goes for the whole year and if at any time anybody feels they can’t do that then let’s move them on because that’s what playing for your country is all about.’

The next 12 months will decide whether Moores is still around to make the same rallying call this time next year.
