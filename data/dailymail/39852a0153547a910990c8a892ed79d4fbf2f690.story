There are a lot of new things in his life - new long hair, new single life, new problems (the Keeping Up With The Kardashians star was involved in a fatal accident earlier this month) and now a new mansion.

On Thursday Bruce Jenner was spotted moving into the very private and roomy hilltop property nestled deep within the hills of Malibu. Surrounding homes sell for $10m.

Earlier the 65-year-old ex-husband of momager Kris Jenner showed off manicured nails (and he is still wearing that wedding band) as he stopped by Starbucks coffee in the beachside town.

The former Olympian was seen making sure several items got taken into the new pad.

There was a king-sized mattress and an iron bed frame, among other things, that were being moved into the estate that had views of the Pacific Ocean as well as neighboring canyons.

Also at  spread - which has three garages - was his son Brandon.

The musician went shirtless as he moved bar stools from a white pickup truck into the flashy residence.

The stepfather to Kim, Kourtney, Khloe and Rob had on a blue striped golf shirt, grey slacks and wore his long mane down.

The light grey 3,500 square-foot home is far from modest.

According to People, it has four bedrooms and four bathrooms and sit on 11 acres.

'For someone seeking privacy, the property is a gem,' a source told the site.

There is a large rectangular pool in the back and an oversized balcony that could fit at least 20 people.

The style is modern with floor to ceiling windows.

Though it is large, the property is much less ornate that the Spanish style home he shared with Kris, 59, in Hidden Hills until 2013.

The Malibu residence also appears to be brand new with an untouched roof and what appears to be fresh landscaping around the home.

Bruce may have chosen to move now as he has been under the microscope lately.

Not only has he been strongly hinting that he wants to transition into a female (thanks to longer hair, painted nails and what appears to be a more curvy body sometimes covered by Spanx), but he was also the center of a fatal accident on Pacific Coast Highway on February 7.

The father of model daughters Kendall, 19, and Kylie, 17, was driving a dark blue Cadillac Escalade at the time and dragging a dune buggy when he hit 69-year-old widow Kim Howe of nearby Calabasas.

A lot of things to move in: In addition to mattresses and a bed frame, there were bar stools and surf boards

She was in a white Lexus and pushed into oncoming traffic where a black Hummer smash into her, causing her to die.

Several others were involved in the accident as well and were taken to the hospital.

On Wednesday it was revealed Jenner was going 38 mph. It has also been speculated that the E! star could have hit two cars in the pile up. TMZ reported the accident was caught by cameras mounted on an MTA bus.

It is still not clear how the accident happened though it has been speculated that Bruce could have been texting, smoking or looking down, and that is how he rear-ended Howe.

At first a Jenner source claimed paparazzi were chasing the star, but police ruled that out quickly.

Since the accident, the attention on Bruce has only intensified with weekly magazines making him a main subject.

On Wednesday Star reported that the single reality star is interested in dating women still.

'He's not sure if the hormone treatments will change how he feels about men,' a family insider said in the March 9 edition. 'But right now he says that he still likes women.' 

That same day InTouch Weekly revealed old photos of the sports icon dresses as a woman from the early eighties to be a part of a Bob Hope special. 

People had a story too, claiming Bruce has 'cried with Kris' over the accident on PCH.

'She has told him that no matter what happens next, they're going to face it as a family,' a source insisted.

'Bruce has Kris' full support. She'll be there for him to lean on every step of the way. Bruce is really devastated that someone died in the accident. It's a very dark time.'

This is what could have happened: It has been speculated that the February 7 fatal crash Jenner was involved in on PCH was caused by Bruce who hit two cars and not just one
