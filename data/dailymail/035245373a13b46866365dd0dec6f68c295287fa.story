It's the childhood hobby adored by adults in search of a stress buster: Colouring in is officially the new hobby du jour and boasts increasing numbers of fans.

And nowhere is it more popular than in France, where colouring books are, astonishingly, now outselling cookery tomes.

Now the trend has arrived on these shores, with scores of adults-only colouring books featuring elaborate designs hitting shelves.

Popular: Colouring in is the new hobby du jour and devotees say it's the ultimate adult stress-buster

Popular: Creative Therapy Colouring Book (£9.09, Michael O' Mara) is one of the new wave

With titles like Vintage Patterns: Creative Colouring for Grown-ups and Secret Garden: An Inky Treasure, the new look colouring books are a world away from the simple tomes enjoyed by children.

But the new trend isn't all about being creative. Many more are targeted at men and women hoping to combat stress.

'There’s
 something about just colouring that’s incredibly relaxing and 
satisfying at the same time,' confirms Fiona Slater, a 30-year-old colouring in fan from London.

'It doesn’t need much thought, apart from 
selecting the colours which is crucial, and you can do it 
for five minutes or hours at a time.'

Among the 
most recent additions to the de-stressing sub genre is The Art Therapy 
Colouring Book (Michael O' Mara) which is billed as 'perfect for de-stressing and embracing 
your inner creative'.

Inside,
 it is awash with elaborate patterns, many of which draw on delicate 
traditional chinoiserie but reworked to maximise stress busting.

Many of the converts to colouring in are professional women, Slater, for instance, is a senior editor at a publishing house, looking for new ways to unwind while also reliving happy childhood moments.

'It’s something my mum used to do when I was little so 
the idea of adults getting busy with the colours isn’t new to me,' explains Slater.

'I just
 think it’s a shame that it’s taken this long for people to really 
appreciate that it’s not just for kids. But then perhaps my mum was a 
bit of a pioneer in that respect.'

Childhood favourite: Most of us have happy memories of afternoons spent colouring in as a child

Another adult devotee of colouring in, West Midlands teacher Jan Beck, 60, says she adored colouring in as a child and gets a similar sense of satisfaction when completing a picture now.

'As a child I always enjoyed colouring in,' she says. 'I
 had a set of Lakeland crayons that I kept in the same order in the pack
 so that I knew where each colour would be.

'I used to be really careful about making sure the colouring was within the lines of the picture or pattern 
so I would be pleased with the finished item.'

And for Mrs Beck, the appeal of colouring in hasn't changed much since her childhood. 'I love colouring as I get great 
satisfaction from finishing a picture,' she adds.

'I find colouring very 
relaxing and often colour while I'm watching the television or listening
 to music. I like that each creation is individual to you - no-one else would colour it in the same way so it is unique.'

Stress-busting: Thanks to its soothing properties, colouring in is now enormously popular with adults as well

And Mrs Beck and Ms Slater certainly aren't alone. According to publishing house Michael O' Mara, sales of colouring books have surged over the last nine months.

'Colouring is taking over from sudoku and crosswords as the adult way to pass some relaxing time on the train or the plane,' explains Chairman Michael O'Mara.

'It's fun and creative without being a strain on the grey cells, so it’s more relaxing and stress-free and there are clearly a lot of arty people out there.'

'Anyone who thinks it's a waste of time clearly hasn’t tried it for themselves,' adds Slater. 'If you’ve ever 
scrawled a doodle on a pad while on the phone you’ve got time for 
colouring in.'
