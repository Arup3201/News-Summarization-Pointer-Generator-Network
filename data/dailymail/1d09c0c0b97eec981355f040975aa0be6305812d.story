Kris Jenner may have been the most anticipated star at last night's National Television Awards, but it seems her daughter Kim still managed to put her stamp on the ceremony despite not even being there.

Kim, known and loved for her glamorous wardrobe, seemingly inspired several of the stars on Wednesday night.

Chloe Sims, Gemma Collins, Casey Batchelor and Stephanie Davis all appeared to have channelled the style queen with their red carpet choices.

TOWIE star Chloe Sims channeled Kim Kardashian, right, in a skin-hugging PVC dress... and she's not the only one who appeared to be Keeping Up With Kim at Wednesday night's National Television Awards

Chloe Sims, who found fame on The Only Way Is Essex, chose to don a sexy dress a la Kim. 

Chloe stood out from the crowd in her all-black ensemble as she teamed the plunging dress with black stiletto heels and a matching clutch bag.

The TOWIE veteran ensured that her red manicure matched her red lipstick while she styled her locks in the glamorous curls. 

The 32-year-old proved she doesn’t have an inch to pinch in a skin tight PVC dress, but haven't we seen that look before?

Back in September last year, Kim wore a very similar style to watch her rapper beau Kanye perform at the Made In America festival.

The 34-year-old went all out in a skintight leather frock as she supported the rapper backstage, accompanied by her sisters Kylie Jenner and Khloe and mother Kris in Los Angeles.

And how could we forget the figure-hugging tight latex outfit she wore in Melbourne to launch her fragrance in November last year?

The mother-of-one squeezed her hourglass figure into the Atsuko Kudo strapless blush-pink ensemble with her cleavage almost spilling out and her now infamous derriere very much on show.

Hollyoaks actress Stephanie Davis, meanwhile, went for a gothic-inspired look as she flashed the flesh in a sheer lace black dress.

The frock, which featured a long-sleeved sheer layer over a strapless black bodysuit, certainly looked familiar.

In fact, Kim wore an uncannily similar one arriving at the Givenchy show in Paris in September to support her younger model sister, Kendall.

The curvaceous wife of Kanye West looked sexy, yet classy, in a sheer black jumpsuit.

Presenter Tess Daly opted for a black and white jumpsuit just like the one that Kim designed for Lipsy, right

The plunging leotard-style bodice, which revealed her ample assets beautifully, flowed into wide see-through trouser legs of embellished lace.

Kim loved the look so much that she recently hailed it as her favourite of 2014. Writing on her Twitter, she posed a picture of herself donning the design with the caption: 'This Givenchy look could possibly be my favorite look of 2014.' 

Glamour girl and former Big Brother star, Casey Batchelor, wore a similar design. 

Casey also opted to show off her recently reduced cleavage in a sexy sheer gown.

The busty starlet drew focus to her 32EE bosom in the lace detail gown which perfectly showcased her slim figure.

While her outfit was akin to one Kim has worn, her hair was undeniably similar, too. 

Essex star Gemma Collins showcased a new style, wearing an on-trend tuxedo style suit dress, similar to one Kim wore when she was pregnant in 2013.

Gemma oozed glamour in the sophisticated number, which she teamed with dazzling peep-toe heels and a Louis Vuitton handbag. 

Tess Daley wore a black and white jumpsuit similar to the one Kim designed for Lipsy last year, while Alesha Dixon championed a polo neck style black dress - a look that's loved by Kim.

Speaking about Kim's much emulated style, Lydia Jones, founder of www.wantherwardrobe.com, said: 'Kim Kardashian has rapidly become one of the world's most stylish fashionistas, famous for dressing her curves to perfection and not being afraid of trying out the most daring trends. 

'It's little wonder that the stars at last night's awards are replicating her bang-on-trend looks.

'From super tight two-pieces to oversized coats with leather dresses, we are loving her sexy but sophisticated style.

'Customers are wanting to emulate this classic style, which can be seen in our bandage skirts, polo neck and skirt two-piece sets and low plunging dresses. Our Kim inspired items are always a total sell-out proving that Kimmy is a top style leader for savvy consumers.'
