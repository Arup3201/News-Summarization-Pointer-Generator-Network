Hazel Martinez, 7, died when fire tore through her Bronx apartment in the early hours of yesterday

A seven-year-old girl died and her younger sister was seriously injured after fire swept through their Bronx apartment while the family slept.

Firefighters arrived three minutes after the emergency call in the early hours of yesterday morning and pulled Hazel Martinez from the fourth floor apartment, but they were too late to save her.

Her half-sister Hailey, aged three, was rushed to hospital where she remains in a critical condition following the fire that is believed to have been caused by faulty wiring.

Neighbours said a woman was heard screaming 'My kids, my kids are inside' as the fire tore through the top-floor Fleetwood apartment, home to the girls' father, Shaun Martinez, their mothers, and three other siblings.

Hazel's paternal grandfather German Martinez said his heart was broken at the death of the little girl he played football with every Sunday.

He said: 'She was the smartest in the whole family, she was the best.

He told the New York Daily News: 'She meant the world to me.  She used to tell me " Grandpa, you are the best of the best."'

Mr Martinez Sr said his son was devastated over the loss of his elder daughter.

He told the New York Post: 'My son's torn up over this.  He's in deep shock.'

Neighbour Anita Harris, 50, said she watched as firefighters tried to get everyone out of the building, while one emergency services worker performed CPR on one of the girls.

She told wsj.com: 'They were screaming "Fire, get out, get out".  You couldn't see anything, just black.'

Another neighbour, John Matos, told how he kicked the apartment door down but was beaten back by the black smoke, which was too thick for neighbours to get in any further.

Hazel's grandfather described her as 'the smartest one in the whole family' and said she had a passion for knowledge

It took firefighters half an hour to bring the blaze under control, and some were left with minor injuries after battling the fire.

Another adult from the apartment was taken to hospital following the blaze and is still receiving treatment.

One neighbour said Hazel's mother was in shock following the accident, which is believed to have been caused by wiring on a new stove overheating.

Neighbour Johnnie Capeles told ABC News: 'Every which way you looked, there was somebody screaming'

It is believed that a small fire started as a result, and the flames may have travelled to a five-tank can of gasoline which had been stored in a nearby cupboard since Hurricane Sandy.

Hazel was pronounced dead on arrival at Lincoln Hospital, while her sister is being treated at New York-Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medical Centre.

Hazel attended Public School 35 over the road from her brick apartment block, and neighbours said she would often play outside in the street with her little sister.
