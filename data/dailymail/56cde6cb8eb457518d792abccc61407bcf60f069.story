Jailed: Tracey Connelly, mother of abused toddler Baby Peter, could be released on parole

The jailed mother of tortured Baby P is seeking parole and could be released from prison 'within weeks', it has emerged.

Tracey Connelly, 32, has spent just four years behind bars for her role in the death that shocked Britain, and even her own mother said of her bid for freedom: 'She should never come out'.

Connelly was jailed indefinitely in 2009 after she admitted doing nothing while her little boy was tortured to death by her boyfriend Steven Barker and his paedophile brother Jason Owen.

Peter was just 17-months-old when he was found dead in his blood-spattered cot at his mother's north London flat, after suffering a catalogue of horrifying injuries including a broken back.

Taking into account the time Connelly spent on remand, she has now served her minimum term of five years, and has applied to The Parole Board to have her case reviewed.

News of Connelly's possible release was met with horror from Baby Peter's grandmother Mary O'Connor, 63, who said her daughter should remain locked up for life.

‘She should never come out.  But even 
if she does I won’t be seeing her again, she’s out of my life,’ she told The Sun.

Ms O’Connor, who previously made 
comments on her daughter's extreme weight gain in prison, told the 
newspaper Connelly is hoping the two women could start a new life in Kent, but said she had no desire to be reunited her daughter.

‘She wants to live in Kent and wants me to move there with her.

‘But I said “No”'

She attacked two of her 
children and stood by while Peter was tortured to death by Barker and Owen.

At the trial, Connelly denied knowing who had caused the injuries to her son.

Peter suffered sickening injuries including a broken spine, injured ribs and removed 
fingernails - all of which was missed by social service workers.

Horrific: Paedophile Steven Barker was jailed for life for his role in Baby Peter's death

Three
of the children - Peter and two of his siblings - were on Haringey's 
Child Protection Register because of fears they were being neglected by 
their mother.

Social workers, health visitors and doctors saw the family 60 times before Peter died from his injuries.

Sharon Shoesmith, the former children’s services chief at the London borough of Haringey, waged a long battle to clear herself of any personal responsibility for the tragedy.

She expressed ‘sorrow’ for Peter’s death, but has never apologised for her role in her department’s failings.

Barker
and Owen were both convicted of causing or allowing Peter's death after
he was found in his cot on August 3, 2007.

Barker was given a life sentence for the rape of the two-year-old, with a 20-year minimum.

Connelly admitted allowing her son's death and was also given an indeterminate sentence.

The Parole Board has previously refused to allow her outside prison walls, but are now assessing her case.

The Board has confirmed that a review has been launched.
