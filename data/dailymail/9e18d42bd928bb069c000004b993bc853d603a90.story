Despite an England career spanning 14 years, six tournament appearances and 114 caps, it is unlikely that Steven Gerrard will have anything but heartache to look back upon following his retirement from international football.

The captain called it a day on Monday following yet another deeply disappointing World Cup campaign but, from Belgium in 2000 to Brazil in 2014, it is fair to say that he never got close to the success that he so badly craved.

Here, Sportsmail charts the England career of Gerrard and the frustration that he never really got a chance to hit the heights that he was so capable of.

Euro 2000

Just two weeks after making his England debut, Gerrard came on as a substitute in the 1-0 win over Germany but could not prevent his side going out at the group stage.

World Cup 2002

Scored in the famous 5-1 qualifying win in Germany — the finest hour for boss Sven Goran Eriksson  — but missed the finals with a groin injury.

Euro 2004

Played in all four games, and scored against Switzerland in the group stages. Started against hosts Portugal in the last eight but was substituted before the unsuccessful penalty shootout.

Too soon: Gerrard and team-mates celebrate going 1-0 ahead against Portugal in Euro 2004. But they eventually lost on penalties.

World Cup 2006

Scored two goals in the group stages in Germany  but missed his spot-kick  as England were knocked out on penalties by Portugal in the quarter-finals for  the second successive tournament.

Euro 2008

Was captain as England lost  3-2 to Croatia  at Wembley  and failed to qualify under Steve McClaren.

World Cup 2010

Went to South Africa as captain and scored an early goal in the opening game against the United States.

But could do nothing to stop Germany shredding Fabio Capello’s side to pieces in the last 16.

Euro 2012

Helped England qualify top of their group in Ukraine but after a desperate goalless draw with Italy in the last eight they went out on penalties, even though he scored from the spot.

Emotion: Despite scoring his spotkick, England once again exited on penalties at Euro 2012

World Cup 2014

Again led his country at a World Cup but again it ended in disappointment, with England heading home after defeats to Italy and Uruguay and a goalless draw with Costa Rica in the group stages.

Heartbreak: And in his final tournament, England went out after just two games following two defeats at the 2014 World Cup
