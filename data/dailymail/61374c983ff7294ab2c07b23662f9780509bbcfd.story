A father-of-two who lost his leg after falling 100ft off a mountain side has bounced back to scale cliffs five times a week with the help of a prosthetic limb.

Craig DeMartino, 48, had his left leg amputated in 2002 after a miscommunication with his climbing partner in the Rocky Mountain range which left him fighting for his life.

Falling onto granite rocks, he broke his neck, ripped a hole in his right lung, the vertebrae in his lower back was pulverised.

Determined: Craig DeMartino, 48, fell 100ft after a miscommunication with his climbing partner in 2002

After two months in hospital, his leg failed to heal and doctors offered to surgically remove it.

Despite his ordeal, Mr DeMartino, from Loveland in Colorado, USA, opted for amputation in the hope it would give him a better chance to climb, walk and cycle again with the help of a prosthetic limb.

Now, 11 years later, he is scaling mountains five times a week.

Desperate to get back on the rocks, Mr DeMartino, who lives with his wife, fellow climber Cyndy, and their children Will and Mayah, helped design the prosthetic limb to make it suitable for climbing.

Decision: Mr DeMartino, a father-of-two from Colorado, opted to amputate his left leg when it failed to heal after two months in hospital. He got straight to designing a prosthetic limb to climb with

Battle: He was apprehensive at first - and his family never wanted him to risk his life again after the incident

Nonetheless, he was tentative in the months after his operation and his family never wanted him to climb a mountain again.

But after completing a climb smoothly, their fears were calmed.

Mr DeMartino, who wrote a book about his ordeal titled ‘After the Fall’, said: 'When I realised I was falling it was more surprise than fear.

'You don’t have time to be scared you’re just dealing with the things as they happen.

Mission: 'It was a really long process across years to get the fear under control,' he said

'The rocks and trees and the ground rushed up to meet me so fast, yet I could still see detail in all the things around me, from the pine trees to the grey granite blocks on the ground.

'Once I hit the ground my only memory is the pain that was running through my body.

'I was so badly injured but all I felt was this searing pain in my back. It felt like a long time to get me out yet it was five hours that stretched on in my mind.

'I was in hospital for two months then home for another month before I could really do anything.

'It was such a slow and painful process so I’d deal with the days broken down into small pieces, so I could work through everything.'

After the accident Mr DeMartino had to learn how to make his body move and work again and he believes climbing was a great tool to help.

He added: 'I love the idea that you are problem solving in a vertical environment, plus when you’re outside, you get to see the most amazing places.

'My leg never healed and was holding me back - I wanted to decide if I was going to climb. Up until that point, the accident had decided pretty much everything for me.

'That was one choice I had to make and it was really empowering to be able to take control of a part of my life again.

'Climbing with a prosthetic limb was a totally new process for me. I’ve learned to make the leg work for me, instead of fighting it all the time and I actually like the process of unlocking the ways to climb things again as a disabled climber.

'At first I would swear it off every time and decide to never climb again but then I would remember one or two small things I liked about the experience and that would be enough.

Happy: Mr DeMartino says he was happy to be in control of a choice that has shaped his life

Passionate: Mr DeMartino loves his hobby and his wife Cyndy, a fellow climber, is his biggest supporter

'It was a really long process across years to get the fear under control. Today I’m as at ease as ever when I climb.

'There is always an element of fear but climbing teaches you to deal with fear and still move forward.

'My wife is a climber as well and she has always been my biggest supporter. From the beginning, whatever I decided about climbing she was behind me.

'You have to work through so many things as your life changes. My parents were super upset with me when I went back in the beginning but they have seen what climbing does and means to me.'
