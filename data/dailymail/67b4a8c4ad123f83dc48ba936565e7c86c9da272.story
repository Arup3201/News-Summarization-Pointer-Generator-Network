Hurricane Katia could soon hit the U.S. east coast - just days after Irene caused extensive flooding, and Tropical Storm Lee dumped torrential rain across the central Gulf.

The Miami-based U.S. National Hurricane Centre said that yesterday Katia had intensified over the open Atlantic and was bulking up to a powerful Category 2 storm.

But although the centre revealed it was still too soon to gauge the potential threat to land, most of its computer models predicted that Katia will veer, on a northeastern track, back out to sea later this week.

The centre said: '(Ocean) swells associated with Katia are already approaching parts of the east coast of the United States.

'Even if Katia does not directly impact the United States, the threat for high surf and rip currents along east coast beaches is expected to increase over the next few days.'

At 5pm yesterday (9pm GMT), Katia had top sustained winds of 105 miles per hour and was about 365 miles north-northeast of the northern Leeward Islands.

The centre said Katia could become a 'major' hurricane on Monday, with maximum sustained winds of at least 111 mph (178 kph).

The uncertainty over the storm's definitive track came because of Tropical Storm Lee's presence over the Gulf of Mexico.

Forecast: Hurricane Katia is expected to veer back out to the north-east and avoid hitting land

Models: Several U.S. states, including New Jersey and Vermont, are still recovering from extensive flooding caused by Hurricane Irene, which rampaged up the East Coast a week ago

It is not known how it will affect Katia's circulation later this week, forecasters said.

Katia is the second hurricane of the June-through-November Atlantic hurricane season. The season is entering what has traditionally been its most active period.

Several U.S. states, including New Jersey and Vermont, are still recovering from extensive flooding caused by Hurricane Irene, which rampaged up the East Coast a week ago.

The centre of Tropical Storm Lee stretched across the central Gulf Coast yesterday, dumping torrential rains that threatened flooding in low-lying communities in a foreshadowing of what cities further inland could face in coming days.

Lee's centre crawled ashore in Louisiana before dawn after the vast, soggy storm system spent hours during the weekend hovering in the northernmost Gulf of Mexico.

By Sunday, at least six to ten inches of rain had fallen in some spots along the Louisiana and Mississippi coasts, and the National Weather Service warned there was a threat of extensive flooding and flash floods because of the storm's slow, meandering jog inland.

The drenching rain bands were expected to head northward into the Tennessee Valley later in the week as forecasters warned that 10 to 15 inches of rain were possible along the central Gulf Coast and up to 20 inches in isolated spots.

National Hurricane Center specialist Robbie Berg said the flash flood threat could be more severe as the rains moves from the flatter Gulf region north into the rugged Appalachians.

Closer to the Gulf, the water is 'just going to sit there a couple of days,' he said. 'Up in the Appalachians you get more threat of flash floods - so that's very similar to some of the stuff we saw in Vermont.'

Vermont is still cleaning up and digging out dozens of communities that were damaged and isolated by heavy rain from Hurricane Irene last week that quickly overfilled mountain rivers.

No injuries were reported so far from Lee. But even before Lee swept ashore, there were scattered instances of water entering low-lying homes and businesses in Louisiana's bayou country - a region of fast-eroding wetlands long vulnerable to hurricanes and tropical storms.

The storm prompted evacuations in bayou towns such as Jean Lafitte. Thousands were without power.

Late on Saturday, lifelong Jean Lafitte resident Brad Zinet was riding out the storm in his mobile home mounted on pilings. He was hoping it wouldn't take on water.

'We got nowhere to go. We're just getting everything put up out of the way and hope for the best,' said the 31-year-old plumber.

'This is a way of life around here,' he added. 'You just do the best you can and ride it out.'

A week after Hurricane Irene caused massive flooding and claimed at least 46 lives as it barrelled up the east coast, President Barack Obama headed to northern New Jersey yesterday, for a first-hand look at the damage while keeping an eye on Lee.

Although Lee is expected to weaken in coming days, the system was expected to unleash heavy rains over a wide area of the central Gulf Coast and then spread that precipitation into the Tennessee Valley, forecasters said.

To the east, coastal businesses were suffering. Alabama beaches that would normally be packed for the Labor Day holiday were largely empty, and rough seas closed the Port of Mobile. Mississippi's coastal casinos, however, were open and reporting brisk business.

In New Orleans, sporadic downpours caused some street flooding Saturday, but pumps were sucking up the water and sending it into Lake Pontchartrain. Officials said the levees were doing their job in the city that is still recovering from the deadly Hurricane Katrina a half decade ago.

New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu warned residents not to let their guard down, saying: 'We're not out of the woods. Don't go to sleep on this storm.'

To the east, coastal Mississippi officials were bracing for the storm to move further into the state. 'We've been getting some pretty good onshore rains,' said Jackson County emergency director Donald Langham.

Harrison County officials said travel on U.S. Highway 90 had become hazardous because winds from Lee have pushed sand from beach onto the eastbound lanes and the rain has created a situation where drivers cannot see the roadway.

'This layer of sand has gotten up on the highway and you can't determine if you're on the road, up on the median or the curb,' said emergency director Rupert Lacy.

Flooding in Hancock County left several roadways impassable, and the rain on parts of Interstate 10 at times has been so heavy that visibility was down to only a few feet.

In Alabama, rough seas forced the closure of the Port of Mobile. Pockets of heavy rain pounded the beaches Saturday, and strong winds whipped up the surf and bowed palm trees. But just a couple miles inland, wind and rain dropped significantly.

Wet and windy conditions hovered over Dauphin Island, a barrier island in the Gulf, but conditions weren't too threatening, Mayor Jeff Collier said. High surf caused some roads to flood, but all were still passable Saturday afternoon.

Precautions were taken to secure anything that could be swept away by wind or waves, and Labor Day concerts and other festivities were canceled. Beaches that would normally be packed were nearly empty.

'The weekend is literally a wash,' Collier said. 'It's really a shame that it happened on a holiday weekend.'

Elsewhere, the National Hurricane Center said Hurricane Katia was trekking across open ocean about 365 miles (587 kilometers) northeast of the Northern Leeward Islands. No coastal watches or warnings were in effect with the storm so far out to sea.

The center said Katia had top sustained winds of 75 mph (121 kph) and was moving at 12 mph (19 kph) with little change in recent hours.
