A modified exhaust tested by Mercedes in Spain has failed to make the new cars sound any louder,  Nico Rosberg claimed on Wednesday.

The noise produced by this season's 1.6-litre turbo engines has come under scrutiny from most corners of the sport this season with a working group subsequently tasked to find a solution.

Mercedes, who supply engines to four teams on the grid, have led the development process in cooperation with the FIA and under Bernie Ecclestone's insistence.

New look: The tail pipe has been dramatically widened since Sunday's Spanish Grand Prix

The 'trumpet' design was unveiled for the
 first time on the back of Rosberg's W05 hybrid during Wednesday's test 
at the Circuit de Catalunya.

But the German revealed afterwards that the tail pipe, which had been widened in order to create more volume, failed to do so.

'It wasn't a great solution,' Rosberg said said in a video posted on Instagram. 'It just didn't work. It didn't make it much louder. So we'll just have to look for another solution.'

The season's dominant team, runaway winners of all five races so far, had agreed to try out the trumpet-like device to try and pump up the volume after complaints that the new V6 turbo hybrid cars were too quiet compared to the old V8 screamers.

The softer sound provided an immediate controversy when the season started in Australia in March with some race promoters, who met in Barcelona on Saturday, fearing ticket sales could fall off if fans were alienated by the lack of decibels.

Others in favour of the quieter new era argue that increasing the noise goes against the greener spirit of the regulation changes, which reduce wasted energy from the exhaust and brakes and harness it to improve fuel economy.

'It's an interesting moment in time for Formula One,' Mercedes motorsport head Toto Wolff said last weekend.

'Traditionally you would have said... that Formula One needs to be loud to be spectacular. Maybe now that's changing.'

While the noise, or lack of it, was a talking point on Wednesday others got on with their regular business.

Ina action: Susie Wolff was testing for Williams ahead of her grand prix debut at Silverstone later this year

Job done: The British driver was fifth fastest in Barcelona on Wednesday

Red Bull had quadruple champion Sebastian Vettel in their car while Venezuelan Pastor Maldonado topped the fairly meaningless timesheets with Lotus.

Williams had Susie Wolff getting acquainted with their car before she becomes the first female driver since 1992 to feature in a grand prix weekend when she takes part in practice at Silverstone in July. She was fifth fastest and completed 55 laps.

Belgian reserve Stoffel Vandoorne had his first drive of a Formula One car and completed enough laps with McLaren to secure the superlicence he will need if a race seat comes his way.
