Manchester City hope to finalise the protracted £32million signing of Eliaquim Mangala from Porto over the next 48 hours.

The 23-year-old was due to return to training with the Portuguese club on Tuesday after being on World Cup duty with France.

City, meanwhile, are considering loan requests from Valencia and Deportivo La Coruna for 23-year-old midfielder Bruno Zuculini who joined last month from Racing in a £3m deal.
