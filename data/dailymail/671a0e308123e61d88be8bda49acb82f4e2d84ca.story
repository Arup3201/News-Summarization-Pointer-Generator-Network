A former lover of Chelsea footballer Samuel Eto'o has accused the striker or being seven years older than he claims to be

A former lover of Chelsea footballer Samuel Eto'o has accused the striker or being seven years older than he claims to be.

The allegation comes a day after Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho said Eto'o was probably older than 32.

‘The problem with Chelsea is I lack a scorer,’ said Mourinho.

‘I have Eto’o but he is 32 years old, maybe 35, who knows?’

Now the footballer's ex Anna Barranca has joined the debate telling The Sun: 'I think Samuel is not 35 he is more 39.

'Samuel was born in 1974 and so that makes him 39 now.'

The Italian hairdresser says she was informed of the sport stars true age by a friend who grew up with Eto'o in Cameroon, west Africa.

A Chelsea source said Eto'o's passport clearly states that the footballer is 32.

Ms Barranca, 43, is the mother of his child Annie.

Mourinho arrived in Istanbul on Monday night livid that remarks he made in a private conversation which undermine his strikers had been secretly filmed and broadcast.

The manger was caught in conversation with the boss of Swiss watch-makers Hublot, explaining that Chelsea did not have anyone to score goals.

He joked that Samuel Eto’o was 
probably older than 32 and hinted that an ideal solution may be to sign 
Radamel Falcao because the Colombian deserved a bigger audience than he 
had at Monaco.

The 
conversation was recorded by French broadcasters Canal+ in Switzerland 
on February 17 and appeared as a video clip on their website.

It has since been removed but Mourinho’s words had already been well circulated, much to his embarrassment.

The MailOnline has contacted Eto'o's agent and is awaiting a comment.
