Paedophile Jeffrey Epstein hosted Stephen Hawking on the private Caribbean island where Prince Andrew is alleged to have slept with an underage ‘sex slave’.

The celebrated physicist attended a conference on the Caribbean island of St Thomas as part of an event sponsored by shamed Epstein, who describes himself on his blog as a ‘science philanthropist’.

Professor Hawkingwas reportedly one of a number of eminent scientists invited to the event, which included trips to the sex offender's private island retreat nearby.

A picture of Professor Hawking, purportedly taken during the conference, is featured on the ‘Jeffrey Epstein VI Foundation’ blog in a posting topped with the dateline March 21, 2012.

But it is not yet clear when the conference - called 'The Energy of Empty Space That Isn't Zero' - took place or how long it lasted. 

The blog states that guests ‘could meet, discuss, relax on the beach, and take a trip to the nearby private island retreat of the science philanthropist Jeffrey Epstein, who funded the event.’

Professor Hawking's representatives have yet to respond to requests for a comment.

Epstein’s Caribbean island of Little St James lies a short distance from St Thomas – part of the US Virgin Islands.

It is the same place where Virginia Roberts claims her third and final sexual encounter with Prince Andrew took place. She claims she was 17 when the offences took place.

Andrew has faced mounting controversy after he was named in US civil court documents as having sex with Miss Roberts on three separate occasions – claims vehemently denied by the Duke.

General views of Jeffrey Epstein's private Caribbean island, Little St James, part of the U.S. Virgin Islands, where Miss Roberts claims her third and final sexual encounter with the Duke took place

In the US court papers, she alleges that between 1999 and 2002 she 'was forced to have sexual relations with this prince' in London, New York and on the private Caribbean island owned by Epstein. Under the law of Florida, where the papers were filed, a minor is defined as a person under 18 years of age.

The accusation is contained in a motion filed last month in a Florida court by Ms Roberts who wants to join an existing lawsuit, launched by two other alleged Epstein victims, against federal prosecutors' handling of the financier's case.

Epstein was jailed for 18 months in 2008 for soliciting a minor for prostitution but lawyers for the women claim a secret plea deal he struck with prosecutors granting him, and any potential co-conspirators, immunity from further prosecution violated their clients' rights.

In a strongly-worded statement Buckingham Palace has said: ‘It is emphatically denied that the Duke of York had any form of sexual contact or relationship with Virginia Roberts.

‘The allegations made are false and without any foundation.’
