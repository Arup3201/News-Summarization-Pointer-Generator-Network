A private security guard suffered severe brain hemorrhaging after being trampled by a crowd at a Miami music festival on Friday while she tried to stop a group of people who didn’t have tickets storm a fence to get inside.

Erica Mack, 28, remains listed as ‘critical’ at Jackson Memorial Hospital with severe brain hemorrhaging.

Miami Mayor Tomas Regalado said on Sunday that Mack, who was working at the Ultra Music Festival, was breathing on her own but was disoriented and confused.

‘She was not strong enough to deal with a
 mob of people that actually pushed this fence down, pushing her 
backwards and the fence landing on top of her.

'Now these people started 
trampling on top of her just to get into the event, as a result she 
sustained major head trauma as well as a broken leg,’ said Miami Fire 
Rescue Lt. Ignatius Carroll.

Mayor Regalado blamed the organizers of the three-day electronic music festival for failing to properly secure the venue.

He said he planned to investigate whether a problem with fencing constituted a breach of contract that could help them push the long-running show out of Miami.

The Ultra Music Festival is a three-day electronic music event which takes annually in Miami

Regalado has been a vocal critic of the festival - one of the biggest electronic music events in the country - and has repeatedly said he doesn't want Miami to host it again.

‘What happened this weekend is an event that could have been avoided,’ said Regalado.

‘The organizers of Ultra did not follow the police directive to re-enforce the fence, even though they knew that this year, and the year before, some kids have tried to over run the fences.’

Just hours before the Friday night 
stampede, Miami police had inspected the perimeter of the event and called for additional fencing at the spot where the 
guard was later injured.

But no additional fencing was added, reports The Miami Herald.

City of Miami Commissioner Marc Sarnoff said the situation could have been predicted and prevented after a similar stampede occurred last year at the Ultra Music Festival

The event organizers have released a statement in which they hoped Mack a 'swift and full recovery' and said they were cooperating fully with investigative authorities.

City of Miami Commissioner Marc Sarnoff said the situation could have been predicted and prevented after a similar stampede occurred last year.

'They tried to get into the front gate last year and we had enough security from the City of Miami Police Department,' he said. 

'I’m asking the Chief and the Chief of Fire to meet with me, the Mayor, and the Miami-Dade County Mayor. Let’s get through this weekend and put this thing to bed, never come back again.'
