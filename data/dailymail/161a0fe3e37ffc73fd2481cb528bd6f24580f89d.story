With its white beaches and crystal clear waters, it's no wonder that St Maarten is one of the most popular tourists destinations in the Caribbean. 

But there's another reason holidaymakers flock to the island's Maho beach - it is also the ultimate location for plane spotting.

In these startling images, tourists can be seen reaching up as if to try and grab the planes as they come in to land on the runway situated on the end of the beach.

Ultimate plane spotting: A tourist takes pictures on Maho beach in St Maarten as a passenger jet flies overhead towards the landing strip at Princess Juliana International Airport

Was that a plane? With its white sands and crystal clear water, Maho beach is the perfect place to lie back and relax, if you don't mind the jets flying in overhead

Warning: A sign does warn tourists of the danger of standing at the end of the runway as the giant jets' blast is enough to sweep them off their feet - and potentially injure or even kill them

Thrill seekers: The proximity of the jets makes sunbathing on Maho Beach a bit more interesting than the average tropical paradise

Noisy neighbour: An Air France jet comes in to land over tourists on Maho Beach which is situated a few yards from Princess Juliana International Airport

Princess Juliana International Airport is renowned for its low-altitude flyovers which frequently disrupt the tranquil setting as incoming Boeing 747's carry new sun seekers to the island from around the world.

And even though these images make the flights look like a movie disaster waiting to happen, the safety record is impeccable.

But an ominous sign does warn tourists daft enough to stand at the end of the runway that the giant jets blast is enough to sweep them off their feet - and potentially injure or even kill them. 

The 37 square mile island is split in two with the French part to the north and the Dutch section to the south. The airport is situated in the south west of the island on the Dutch side.

The population of the island is around 75,000, with nearly 39,000 living on the Dutch side and 35,925 on the French side.

Strike a pose: The beach has become a popular tourists attraction because of its low-altitude flyovers. Holidaymakers can be seen lining up along the beach to pose for photos of them 'touching' the jets as they fly overhead

Something for everyone: The view of aeroplanes flying over the beach has become just as popular as sunbathing on it

Star attraction: Princess Juliana International Airport is so close to Maho Beach on St Maarten that airplanes must fly at a minimal altitude so they can touch down on the tiny runways

Boeing 747s fly in from all over the world. Holland's KLM, Air France, Continental, U.S. Airways and American Airlines are just some of the carriers you can spot on any given day
