Supermodel Stella Tennant became the new Givenchy girl in a euphoric rave-style shoot for their latest ad campaign.

The French label's fall 2012 campaign captures a dancing Stella, thumping electro music and an exquisite collection of Givenchy clothes, of course.

The fractured images of the model shimmying beneath a dark and stormy sky aim to capture the euphoric energy of a rave, according to creative director, Richard Tisci - whose shows often feature booming house music.

Tisci's ad was captured by acclaimed and respected photographers Mert and Marcus who are famous in the fashion world for their portraits of sophisticated and powerful women.

As the latest member of the Givenchy gang, Stella is joined by Joan Smalls, as well as newcomers Stef van der Laan, Daniela Braga, and male models Simone Nobili, Jarrod Scott, and Rodrigo Braga.

Styled by Carine Roitfield, the latest photos lend an air of grace and unmistakable perfection to Givenchy's campaign and show Stella donning a purple dress already on the target of various fashion critics.

'It is about happiness and the freedom of expressing yourself with your body. It shows a dynamic, happy and fun world, which is what fashion needs,' said Richard Tisci about his distinctive campaign.

'Stella represents modernity, elegance, 
masculinity and femininity at the same time, together with a dynamic, 
energetic beauty,' he said.

The models will fill the pages of glossy magazines in September.

Stella recently graced the red carpet at the seventh annual Scottish Fashion Awards, held at the Clyde Auditorium in Glasgow.

The event, hosted by Alexa Chung, saw 
Stella proving purple is her favourite colour in fitted purple and black
rippled dress, fishnet nights and on-trend quiffed hair.

Tennant is a fashion favourite, she was 
chosen to walk the runway for Shiatzy Chen, Chanel and is a muse of the 
designer Karl Lagerfeld.

She has also appeared in numerous 
advertising campaigns, including Calvin Klein, Herm√®s, and Burberry and 
has starred in L.K.Bennett's campaign photographed by Tim Walker.
