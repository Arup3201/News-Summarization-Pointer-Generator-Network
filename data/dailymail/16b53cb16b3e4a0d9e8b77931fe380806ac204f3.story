Manchester City's flight home from their warm-weather training trip to Abu Dhabi will not land until 6pm on Friday – just 21 hours before they face Middlesbrough in the FA Cup fourth round.

The Premier League champions had the option to come back on Thursday night but it is understood that manager Manuel Pellegrini preferred to have another training session on Friday morning, before boarding the seven-hour flight at 11am UK time.

Pellegrini’s side meet Championship high-flyers Boro in a 3pm kick-off at the Etihad on Saturday, and it is unusual for teams to make such a long journey so close to a match.

But the City players will be able to go straight from Manchester Airport to the club’s new £200million training base where they can stay overnight before home games and have access to state-of-the-art facilities.

Frank Lampard is likely to miss the tie after suffering a hip injury in the early stages of City’s friendly win over Hamburg on Wednesday.

But the veteran midfielder is only expected to be sidelined for a few days and should be fit to face his old club Chelsea at Stamford Bridge a week Saturday in a game that could have a crucial bearing on the title race.
