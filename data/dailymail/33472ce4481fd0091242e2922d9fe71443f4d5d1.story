Double amputee Gill Hicks will run for the council area of Unley in Adelaide's inner south

An Australian woman, who lost both of her legs in the 2005 terrorist bombings in London, will contest a seat on an Adelaide council.

Self-described peace actionist Gill Hicks will stand as an independent for Unley council in November, saying she is keen to make a difference to her community.

The affluent area of Unley is located in Adelaide's inner south and according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics has a population of almost 40,000 people.

'I'm up for new challenges in life. It's my community, it's where I now call home,' Ms Hicks told ABC radio on Tuesday.

'I absolutely feel passionate about what I can be doing to, pardon the pun, step up and say, "OK, through my experience, what can I contribute?".'

Ms Hicks, who has received an MBE, been the subject of documentaries and is a sought-after motivational speaker, says she feels no specific need to be a campaigner on disability issues.

On July 7, 2005, Ms Hicks was standing just one passenger away from Jermaine Lindsay, 19, when he detonated a bomb in a train carriage on the Piccadilly line between King's Cross and Russell Square stations.

She was one of the survivors of the terrorist attacks, which killed 52 commuters on three trains and a bus.

Ms Hicks was taken to St Thomas's Hospital and at the time was referred to as 'One Unknown' before her identity was discovered.

The same name became the title of a book she penned herself about the tragedy and her recovery process after the bombings.

Ms Hicks was the last victim found alive at the devastating wreckage and her heart stopped twice while she was being transported to hospital.

Things did not look good for Ms Hicks when she lost 75 per cent of her blood, with doctors thinking she would die.

After the bombings, Ms Hicks gave up her successful career in design and founded the charity MAD for Peace.

MAD (Making A Difference) promotes peace in its books, films and events.

In 2008, she carried an Olympic torch, returned to Adelaide in 2012 and gave birth to a daughter last year.
