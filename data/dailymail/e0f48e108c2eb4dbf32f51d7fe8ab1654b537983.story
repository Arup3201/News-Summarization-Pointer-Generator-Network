Legendary rock ‘n’ roll wildman Keith Richards has made perhaps the most shocking and unexpected announcement of his 50 year career and revealed that he's writing a children's book.

Gus & Me: The Story Of My Granddad And My First Guitar is a picture story book which is due out in the fall.

The guitarists’ previous book Life was a million seller in 2010, but while it divulged the debauched secrets of a life of excess and a long-standing addiction to heroin, his new book harks back to simpler times and his childhood.

The Gus of the title is Richards beloved musician-grandfather Theodore Augustus Dupree (known as Gus), who was in a jazz big band.

Richards, 70, said the book was based on 'one of those magical moments' he had with Gus.

According to the reformed hell-raiser it was a perfectly natural step for him to write such a book because he himself is now a grandfather.

'I have just become a grandfather for the fifth time, so I know what I'm talking about,' said Richards. who has five children.

'The bond, the special bond, between kids and grandparents is unique and should be treasured. This is a story of one of those magical moments. May I be as great a grandfather as Gus was to me.'

Richards' biography, Life, explored his addiction to heroin, but his children's book is expected to focus on simpler times when he was a young boy

Publisher Little, Brown Books for Young Readers announced on Tuesday that the book will include illustrations by Richards' daughter, Theodora Richards. Barnaby Harris and Bill Shapiro are assisting with the writing.

It’s the first book for Theodora, who was named after her great-grandfather and is the daughter of Richards and his wife, Patti Hansen.

'To be able to explore my father’s relationship with his grandfather was a gift in itself,' she said. 'The things that I’ve learnt during this whole process have just been life affirming.'

Gus & Me is scheduled for publication on Sept. 9 and will be published simultaneously in hardcover and e-book editions. The hardcover will be packaged with a CD that includes bonus content.

'Who wouldn’t welcome the opportunity to
 meet Keith Richards as a young boy?' Little, Brown Books for Young 
Readers executive vice president and publisher Megan Tingley said.

'Gus & Me invites readers to be in the room at the electrifying moment that Keith holds a guitar in his hands for the first time.'

Richards is currently a very busy man besides writing his new book, the Rolling Stones are in the middle of a Far East tour that will take them to Shanghai on Wednesday, then to Singapore and, next week, to Australia.

Little, Brown and Company paid an advance of $7.3 million for Life and it topped The New York Times non-fiction list in the first week of release. Some controversy arose over comments Richards made about Mick Jagger, including references to his genitalia.
