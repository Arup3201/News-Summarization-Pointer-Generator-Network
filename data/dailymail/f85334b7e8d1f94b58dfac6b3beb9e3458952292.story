When it comes to the most important food items on the Christmas table, the nation is divided. 

And, as unlikely as it may seem, Brussels sprouts are what brings Britons together as almost half of us (48 per cent) believe it is the most important item for the festive feast.

The often derided vegetable is as the nation’s fourth most essential food and drink item for 25 December, new research from Morrisons revealed.

Turkey, stuffing and potatoes make up the top three of the study which also showed that Londoners can't do without cheese - with a quarter claiming it is the most important food on the festive table

The survey of 4,000 Britons called The Great British Christmas Table highlighted how Brits will be celebrating Christmas.

It found 24 per cent will be getting into the Yuletide spirit with a glass or two of Baileys, while munching their way through a tin of either Quality Street or Roses chocolates.

Drinks choices vary between regions more than any food item - with 12 per cent in the East Midlands proudly drinking sherry, compared to three per cent in the North East.  

Londoners say that wine is the most essential tipple for the big day (48 per cent), while those in the North East prefer beer or cider (36 per cent).

Cheese also splits the nation when it comes to the Christmas dinner table. 

Those in the capital are the nation’s biggest cheese lovers, but in the South West only 16 per cent will be found championing cheese.

Revellers in the capital are also among the most adventurous with their meat. 

Almost a quarter of Londoners (24 per cent) say they would spend a little extra on other meats such a goose while only 18 per cent in the East Midlands will venture away from traditional Christmas turkey.

Fifty-seven per cent of people from the North East plan to savour sausages with their dinner but  only 38 per cent of people in Northern Ireland will do the same. 

Over 60 per cent of people from the capital wouldn't dream of adding bacon to their meal while almost half of Brits (48 per cent) in East Anglia embrace it.
