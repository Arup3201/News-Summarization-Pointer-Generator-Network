A conservative Republican congressman released a bumper sticker that infuriated his opponents by connecting the debate over abortion with that of gun control.

Campaign staffers working on the re-election team for Texas Congressman Steve Stockman released the bumper sticker today prompting an immediate backlash.

'If babies had guns they wouldn't be aborted. Vote Pro-Life!' the bumper sticker read.

Fire starter: The bumper sticker was released via Twitter by the Congressman's campaign staff

Right wing: Congressman Stockman, who invited rocker Ted Nugent as his guest to the State of the Union, sells himself as the most conservative member of Congress, though he has not been ranked as such

The slogan was deemed 'outrageous' by the masses on Twitter, many of whom stopped to think about the physical impossibilities implied, but few missed the political implications.

The statement is obviously intended to prompt outrage from critics and serve as a rallying cry from supporters, but a day after posting it to his Twitter feed, it apparently helped fund his campaign war chest for his 2014 re-election bid.

His campaign managers are trying to position him on the far right of the party, appointing him the 'most conservative Congressman in Texas!' in his Twitter bio.

The bio goes on to boast of his '100% lifetime NRA, GOA, NAGR, Right to Life rating'.

Newsworthy: Stockman connected the bumper sticker to the ongoing trial of an abortion doctor who allegedly killed live babies and at least one mother in Philadelphia

Support: Stockman received campaign funds from pro-life and anti-gun control groups

In spite of his own assertions, he is not listed among the top 16 most conservative congressman by the National Journal in their annual rankings.

Though the bumper sticker was released by his campaign staff and not by the Congressman himself, he found a way to make the move timely by tying it into the case against abortion doctor Kermit Gosnell in Pennsylvania who allegedly murdered seven babies in his 'house of horrors' clinic.

'Funny how all it takes is a bumper sticker for Democrats to finally start talking about the unborn like they're people. Hypocrisy exposed,' the Congressman tweeted Friday afternoon.

His strong allegiance to pro-life and anti-gun control groups comes as little surprise when looking at his campaign finance reports.

In the 2012 election, the National Association for Gun Rights, Gun Owners of America, and the National Pro-Life Alliance were among his top 20 donors.

Stockman represents a district of southeast Texas that was created as a result of the 2010 census, so he is the first to serve as its representative.

He previously served as a congressman from 1995 to 1997.
