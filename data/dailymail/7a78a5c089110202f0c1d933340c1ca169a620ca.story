The family of a war hero have finally had the mystery about his World War Two death solved - after being reunited with his Will which had been undiscovered for 67 years.

Private Gordon Heaton died on the Normandy battlefield in 1944 aged just 21, but his family never received his Will and Testament as they were left on a bus by a delivery boy.

Amazingly, the stained documents were
recovered from a lost property box at a bus depot in Birmingham last 
November, allowing staff to return the poignant letter to his family 
nearly seven decades after he was killed on the battlefield.

Brave: Private Gordon Heaton died in 1944, but his family have only just learned of his fate after his Will was lost and then recovered at a Birmingham bus depot

Touched bus drivers from the Acocks Green National Express depot launched a hunt to track down Private Heaton’s family - and finally let them know what happened to the hero.

In a bizarre twist of fate, Pte Heaton’s great nephew was researching his family tree - and stumbled across a news release National Express had placed online, with Pte Heaton’s name on it.

Pte Heaton's family have since been handed the documents for the first time in an emotional meeting.

David Hall, 51, began to search for 
his long-lost relative while caring for his sick grandfather, John 
Heaton - the surviving brother of Pte Heaton.

'After
searching online, I found some information National Express had 
released about their discovery, for someone with the name Private Gordon
Heaton.

'The information from the official records ties in with our family so we know it’s definitely him.

'Although
I’m pleased to make the discovery, I’m slightly tainted with sadness to
think a relative of mine who was fighting for his country died at the 
young age of 21.

'I would rather have him with us here today.'

Poignant: The Will and Testament of Private Gordon Heaton, which was undiscovered for 67 years before being found last November

The misplaced letter asks about the private effects and estate of Private Heaton, who died aged 21

David hasn’t told his grandfather about the discovery yet due to his health but plans to when his condition improves.

David,
from Halesowen, West Midlands, said: 'It will be an honour to pass 
these records on to John, especially after all these years.

'I think it would be unsuitable to mention it yet, but as soon as he’s back on his feet, I will give him the news.

'I have told my mother, who was Gordon’s cousin, and she is pleased we have finally found the final piece of the jigsaw.'

The
paperwork was discovered by Christine McDaid, who works at the National
Express depot in Acocks Green, West Midlands, while she was cleaning out 
their packed lost property office.

Christine, 43, said: 'I found it while I was moving furniture around in the lost property office so it could be painted.

Documents: The Will and Testament have now been returned to Private Heaton's family after being unearthed last year

'I lifted a heavy cardboard box placed
on top of an old metal cabinet and spotted the pristine paperwork 
perfectly preserved underneath.

'I couldn’t believe my eyes when I 
opened it and realised the dusty document was the signed last Will and 
Testament of a 21-year-old soldier.

'It
was sent by the War Office and was also accompanied by a formal typed 
letter to the soldiers’ parents informing them of his death.'

The
tea-stained letter read: 'I am directed to enclose a certified true 
copy of a Will executed by the late No. 4042611 Private Gordon Albert 
Heaton of the Worcestershire Regiment in which you are named as the 
executor.'

It goes on to ask whether the soldier 
had any private estate and, if not, his Army savings will be paid out in
full to the family.

Christine
took it upon herself to discover the young soldier’s true identity - 
and found that Private Gordon had tragically died on the bloody battle 
fields of Normandy on August 27, 1944.

National Express worker Christine McDaid unearthed the letter from a lost property box and was 'almost moved to tears' by its contents

She said: 'It is heart-wrenching to think that this soldier's poor family would never have received it and maybe got some comfort from it.

'It was so nice to meet the family and put a face to who this soldier was.

'It’s been nearly a year since we tried to find Private Gordon’s family - I was starting to think we would never find them.

'The documents were still in their original envelopes unopened, so someone delivering it must have left it on a bus all those years ago.

'My guess is that it was put to one side by someone in lost property and just got forgotten about as they expected someone to claim it.'

The accompanying Will signed by Gordon states that he left his entire estate and all possessions to his mother, J. B. Heaton.

Official records showed that the soldier, who was from Handsworth, West Midlands, was buried in Vernon Communal Cemetery in Normandy, France, alongside 15 comrades.

Christine said: 'The saddest thing is that the Will is dated June 1944 and only a few months later he was dead with this letter informing his family.

'It’s been so nice to give something to Private Gordon’s family that you can see means so much.

'It was quite daunting holding on to something that is so crucial to a family, and I’m so pleased that it is now in the hands of its rightful owners.'

Mr Hall doesn't believe there to be any estate of any substance left by Private Heaton, as he lived with his parents.

Mrs Heaton died very soon after Private Heaton's death, so Mr Hall does not know whether or not any assets he had were passed on to her - despite the correspondence that never reached her.
