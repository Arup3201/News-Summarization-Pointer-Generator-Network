They have been created to make you think and laugh.

Some of the photographs show ridiculous situations while others are a play on 
words. Some are just completely random and surreal.

Another has a young boy reaching for a petrol pump for his tiny child-like jeep.

Other pictures just appear to be completely surreal and quirky.

In another image, a woman is taken aback by the power of her tiny hairdryer, which completely blows her hair to one side.

Writing on his website, the photographer described how he approaches his work.

'Photography is my expression of the things I love in life. Beautiful places. Wonderful moments. Things that make me laugh.'
