PM David Cameron said ‘red warning lights’ are flashing in the global economy as Japan slid back into recession and eurozone growth stutters

Public spending cuts must continue for years to secure Britain’s recovery as the world faces a new financial crisis, David Cameron warned last night.

The Prime Minister and Chancellor George Osborne said ‘red warning lights’ are flashing in the global economy as Japan slid back into recession and already-anaemic growth in the eurozone stuttered.

With official forecasts in next month’s autumn statement expected to show the Government’s efforts to shrink the deficit have stalled, Mr Cameron told MPs: ‘We have made clear that after the next election will be further reductions in spending. The alternative of simply putting up taxes would destroy the recovery.’

Britain was outperforming most of the rest of the world but could be dragged down by failure of other countries – particularly European neighbours – to rein in spending, make their economies more business-friendly and use monetary policy effectively, the Prime Minister said.

Labour leader Ed Miliband accused him of ‘getting his excuses in early’, saying: ‘You used to tell us that the problems in the British economy were all to do with the British Government and nothing to do with international factors.

‘Now, you want to tell us that on your watch they’re all to do with international factors and nothing to do with the British Government.’ 

The mood about the global economy has darkened in recent weeks, with growing fears about the state of the eurozone. 

Official figures last week revealed the countries in the single currency managed only feeble growth of 0.2 per cent in the third quarter of this year, with deflation in a number of nations including Greece.

Economists fear the single currency bloc could be heading for another slump incorporating falling prices, mounting real debt levels and stagnant growth.

Yesterday, the Japanese economy unexpectedly shrank for the second quarter in a row, pushing the world’s third biggest economy into recession. 

China is growing more slowly than at any time in the last five years, while even the US economy has been expanding robustly only in the last six months or so.

The Tories’ intervention appeared calculated to correct a growing assumption by voters that the job of austerity is complete now the UK has turned a corner following the biggest crash since the Great Depression.

Mr Cameron, who returned yesterday from a G20 summit of world leaders in Australia, said: ‘I’m very happy to defend and take some credit for what is happening in the British economy – growing at three per cent, the biggest fall in unemployment on record, 400,000 new businesses.

‘Because of the difficult decisions we took, the British economy is doing well.

‘The difference I would say is now while there are problems in the world economy, you can actually see that Britain is outperforming other countries in the world and the figures speak for themselves.’

But he said the eurozone was ‘teetering on the brink’ of what would be its third recession – and called on the European Central Bank to do more to shore up its economies.

Mr Osborne said: ‘We’ve discovered Japan has gone into recession, Europe remains very weak, and although the British economy is performing well we’re not immune to these things.

‘It’s all the more reason why we’ve got to go on working through our long-term economic plan.’

Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls said: ‘What’s going on here is a government that in two weeks’ time is going to have to make an autumn statement where they would like to say the economy is getting stronger, the deficit is coming down, and people are better off.

‘But they know they’re going to have to say that the economy is weakening, the deficit is getting larger, and for four years people have got worse off.’
