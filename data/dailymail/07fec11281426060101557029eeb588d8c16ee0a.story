Cat-flaps can save owners from having to get up at the crack of dawn to let their cat or dog out.

But they can be draughty and let animals stroll in and out while trampling mud as they go.

Now there’s a smart cat-flap - and even a dog-flap - that can keep animals inside when it detects rain, but can keep them out a pre-programmed times.

The PetWALK automatic cat door also claims to be windproof and thermally insulated to keep drafts out, as well as trapping noise and dust outside.

The company says: ‘PetWALK keeps wind and weather outside and your home warm. It saves energy and is the perfect solution for low-energy house.’

However, all this comes at a price of £1,282.50 for a cat-flap and £1,417.50 for the larger version designed for dogs.

The flap works by detecting an animal wearing a small microchip. It automatically locks and unlocks to seal the door when a pet wearing a matching chip approaches it.

The cat-flap claims to offer one of the most powerful animal-chip reader systems on the market and supports implanted chips as well as chips worn on a pet's collar.

It only allows a certain cat wearing the chip in or out, to keep other people’s pets out of the home.

The system can be programmed to keep animals inside or outside at certain times, which could be used to force lazy pets to get some fresh air or to keep feisty cats inside at night.

The device also works in collaboration with sensors that can be placed outside and can detect when it’s raining to stop pets getting out – or to let them in.

The smart cat flap can be programmed to keep animals inside when it's raining, or outside at certain times of day.

The cat-flap claims to be windproof and thermally insulated to keep drafts out.

It works by detecting an animal wearing a small microchip.

The flap automatically locks and unlocks to seal the door when a pet wearing a matching chip approaches it and has a powerful chip-reader so that pets do not have to wear collars if they have a chip implanted.

The chip system means that other people's pets will not be able to gain entry t a home.

An alarm system also keeps burglars out.

It costs £1,282.50 for a cat-flap and £1,417.50 for the larger version designed for dogs.

The smart cat-flap also comes with an alarm system that prevents burglars from gaining access to a home via the flap, which can be a particular problem for larger dog-flaps.

The Austrian company claims cat-flaps should be like any other window or door in a home.

‘We humans don't squeeze ourselves through holes! Why need our pets to do so? PetWALK is the first real high quality entry door for pets,’ it says.

The door is airtight and well insulated so that it meets criteria for low energy buildings and claims to save homeowners energy and money in the long-run.

The flap has six centimetres of insulation and two silicon seals to keep the heat inside a house.

It is also available in a number of changeable designs so that owners can choose to match their door with a certain colour or wood effect, or opt for a more opulent faux stained glass window.
