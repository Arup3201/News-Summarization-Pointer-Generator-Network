This picture shows the moment a small boy has a gash cut in his head as part of a Shi'ite Muslim Ashura ritual. 

The tradition, which commemorates the death of the Prophet Mohammad's grandson, is seen by some Shi'ite Muslims as away of washing away their sins.

The Day of Ashura is a national holiday in some Muslim countries, with thousands taking part in annual rituals which include people whipping and cutting themselves with chains and knives.

Shi'ite Muslims believe that cutting themselves on the Day of Ashura is a way of cleansing away sin 

This Shi'ite Muslim child had his head gashed during a procession ahead of Ashura in Mumbai, India.

Muslims took part in the event to commemorate Imam Hussein, the grandson of the Prophet Mohammad, who died in battle 1,300 years ago.

Other Shi'ites were seen drenched in blood during the processions in India, Iraq, Lebanon and Afghanistan.

Young children carried large knives through the street and were seen with blood pouring from head wounds. 

There were similar scenes in Lahore, Pakistan, where men were seen with open wounds and scars as they lashed each other. 

Some Shi'ite leaders discourage self-mutilation and bloodletting, claiming it has no basis in early religious history and creates a negative image, and encourage people to donate blood instead.

ISIS claimed responsibility for two bombings on Shi'ite pilgrims that left 23 people dead in Baghdad on Sunday, calling it the 'biggest infidel event'.
