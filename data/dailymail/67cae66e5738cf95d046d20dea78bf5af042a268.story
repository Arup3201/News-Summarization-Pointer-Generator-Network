American boxer Floyd Mayweather picked up almost $2million betting on the NFL in the last three weeks, after staking an astonishing $940,000 (£580,000) on two games.

Mayweather, the world's highest paid sportsman, walked away with $1,825,714.28 (£1,130,000) after successfully betting on both the Seattle Seahawks and the Indianapolis Colts to win by more than seven points.

The Colts, led by quarterback Andrew Luck, beat the Jacksonville Jaguars 44-17 on September 21 before Seattle saw off Washington Redskins 27-17 on Monday.

Mayweather posted the two betting slips, showing his huge winnings, to his Instagram account

And Mayweather took to Instagram to celebrate his success, posting both betting slips along with his total winnings.

'Before I went on a 2-week vacation, I bet $720,000.00 and I walked away with $1,405,714.28,' he wrote of his first win. 'When you’re betting on Andrew, it’s never Luck.'

The WBC and WBA welterweight champion then added, on the second game, 'I bet $220,000.00 on the World Champion Seattle Seahawks (Russell Wilson, Marshawn Lynch and Richard Sherman) and walked away with $420,000.00'.
