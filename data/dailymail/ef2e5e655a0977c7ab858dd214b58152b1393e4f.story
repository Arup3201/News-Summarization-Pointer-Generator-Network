Infuriated customers: NPower boss Paul Massara told residents facing £1,500 bill to 'just use less'

Millions of families are facing annual gas and electricity bills of more than £1,500 for the first time after a price hike by energy giant Npower.

The German-owned supplier was accused of putting ‘profits before people’s lives’ after it announced the average dual fuel bill would rise by 10.4 per cent to an average of £1,491 per year.

The hike means customers in four regions – London, South Wales, the South and parts of Scotland – will see their average bills top £1,500 a year, an all-time high.

Npower – which was accused by MPs earlier this year of dodging tax – insisted the Government’s green taxes were largely to blame for the increase. But it did admit it wanted to increase its own profit margins – to 5p in the pound.

Npower is the latest energy giant to raise prices, after British Gas announced a 9.2 per cent rise last week, and Scottish & Southern Energy an 8.2 per cent hike a week earlier.

Yesterday the firm’s chief executive Paul Massara further infuriated customers when, in a video posted on YouTube, he defended the price hike.

In it he pointed out: ‘It may be a cliche but it’s true: the cheapest unit of energy is always the one that isn’t used.’

He meant householders can protect themselves against rising tariffs by installing double glazing or loft insulation. But he was accused of patronising his customers – many of whom pointed out that they were already rationing their heat.

Mr Massara’s personal Twitter feed is blocked to non-approved followers, but that did not stop people using the social media site to criticise him. One angry customer described his YouTube performace as ‘vomit inducing’.

Earlier this year, MPs reacted with fury at Mr Massara’s defence of Npower’s failure to pay corporation tax. In evidence to Commons select ommittee, he admitted the firm paid no corporation tax in the three years 2009, 2010 and 2011 – despite making £750million over the period.

He insisted it was legal and even desirable because it meant the firm could spend more money on ‘keeping the lights on’. Yesterday, Npower again defended its profit of about £64 per customer a year as ‘reasonable’.

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg issued a warning to energy firms, telling ITV’s The Agenda programme: ‘Profit is what drives a lot of these things but you can’t operate without public consent.’

Npower tried to shift the blame for higher energy bills by pointing to green taxes and eco schemes imposed by the Government, the cost of running the national grid of pipes and wires, as well as ‘the actual cost of buying energy’.

But the wholesale price of gas – which makes up half of the bill – is up just three per cent compared with a year ago, which would only put up bills by 1.5per cent.

In the video Mr Massara said: ‘This has been a really hard decision for us.’

In a blog, he added: ‘I know people 
think energy companies are raking in huge profits at the expense of 
customers, but this simply isn’t the case.’

The
official customer body, Consumer Futures, called for two inquiries to 
establish whether the public are being ripped off – one into the 
structure of the market and a second into green taxes.

Energy
Secretary Ed Davey repeated the official government line that power 
price rises are ‘disappointing’ and urged consumers to shop around.

Clare
Welton of the Fuel Poverty Action Group said: ‘We need to acknowledge 
the problem is the Big Six themselves: they will never priortise 
people’s lives over their profits.’

Energy bills and on the way up - but you 
could save up to £300 by switching.

Providers offer their cheapest rates via online tariffs, 
so if you're ready to switch, it will certainly pay to do so.

But
suppliers tend to charge more for electricity to those customers who 
live in their 'home' region - the areas where they enjoyed a monopoly 
before energy deregulation.

So switching away will almost always save 
you money.

Prices
are different all over the country and the cheapest supplier for you 
will depend where you live. You only need to be interested in the tariff
that is going to be cheapest where you live, so do your own comparison 
to find the best price.
