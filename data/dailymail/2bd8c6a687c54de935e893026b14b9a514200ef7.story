Malcolm Glazer, the man who led the controversial takeover of Manchester United in 2005, has died at the age of 85.

The American businessman will long be remembered as the Florida-based millionaire who took United in to private ownership nine years ago via a highly-leveraged buy-out, plunging the club more than £500million in debt.

Though Glazer Snr has been ill for some time and has left the running of United to sons Joel and Avram for the majority of the family’s ownership period, he was the man who drove the purchase of the club against the wishes of United fans over a two-year period in the early part of the last decade.

Daring businessman: Florida-based billionaire Malcolm Glazer has died at the age of 85

A United spokesman said only: 'The thoughts of everyone at United are with the family tonight.'

The
 Glazer family remain owners of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers American 
football franchise that they bought in 1995. It was on the Bucs’ website that news of Glazer senior’s death was announced.

There
 will be respect but little sympathy from many United fans who will 
always blame Glazer for the money his family’s company have drained from
 Old Trafford over the years to service their enormous debts.

Certainly
 Glazer’s aggressive pursuit and purchase of United changed the club 
forever, leading , for example, one group of fans to breakaway to set up
 non-league outfit FC United while another launched the ‘Green and Gold’
 campaign that tried so hard to drive the Americans out four years ago.

During the Glazer years, United still managed to win five Barclays Premier League titles and one Champions League. 

Reclusive: Glazer was seldom spotted in the limelight

And while Glazer may not have been universally popular in Manchester, he was a widely respected figure in his homeland with tributes pouring in from his homeland.

Buccaneers defensive tackle Gerald McCoy posted on Twitter: 'Rest in peace to the driving force that helped transform the organization that changed my life forever. Forever grateful!! RIP Mr. Glazer.'

NFL commissioner Roger Goodell added: 'Malcolm Glazer was the guiding force behind the building of a Super Bowl-champion organization.

'His dedication to the community was evident in all he did, including his leadership in bringing Super Bowls to Tampa Bay.

'Malcolm's commitment to the Bucs, the NFL and the people of the Tampa Bay region are the hallmarks of his legacy.

'Our thoughts and prayers are with his wife, Linda, their six children and the entire Glazer family.'

Glazer leaves a wife, Linda, and six children - including United's co-chairmen Joel and Avram - and 14 grandchildren.
