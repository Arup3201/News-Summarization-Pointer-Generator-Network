A cousin of ex-New England Patriots player Aaron Hernandez was spared jail time only because of her advanced cancer, a judge said Tuesday in sentencing her to two years of probation.

Tanya Singleton pleaded guilty to refusing to testify before a grand jury even though she had been granted immunity.

'Ms. Singleton's health is the only reason she is not being placed in jail,' Fall River Superior Court Judge E. Susan Garsh said. County jail officials made it clear they could not meet Singleton's medical needs, the judge said.

Tanya Singleton, a cousin of former New England Patriots football player Aaron Hernandez (seen here leaving court with her lawyer E. Peter Parker today) has been spared jail time because of her advanced cancer

Singleton, 38, of Bristol, Connecticut, is subject to GPS monitoring for the entire probationary period, the first year of which must be spent confined to her home, except for medical and legal appointments.

She also was ordered to have no contact with Hernandez, any other suspects or witnesses, except for her father, sister and two close friends.

Singleton had refused to testify before a grand jury investigating the July 2013 slaying of Odin Lloyd.

'Ms. Singleton's health is the only reason she is not being placed in jail,' Fall River Superior Court Judge E. Susan Garsh said

The bullet-riddled body of Odin Lloyd (left) was found in Massachusetts near the home of ex-New England Patriots player Aaron Hernandez (right) in July 2013

Lloyd's bullet-riddled body was found 
in an industrial area near Hernandez's home in North Attleborough. He 
was dating the sister of Hernandez's fiancee.

Hernandez has pleaded not guilty to 
killing Lloyd and is being held without bail. He also has pleaded not 
guilty in the 2012 killings of two men in Boston.

Singleton,
 who has been undergoing treatment for a recurrence of breast cancer, 
pleaded guilty to criminal contempt and had faced up to two-and-a-half 
years in jail.

'Ms. Singleton's willful conduct was an assault on the rule of law,' Garsh said.

Ms Singleton faced up to two-and-a-half years in prison for refusing to testify before a grand jury in order to 'protect'  her cousin but because of her illness she has been granted home confinement

The sentence was in line with what prosecutors requested.

Singleton 'perverted her sense of loyalty' and had an 'utter disdain' of the legal process in trying to protect Hernandez, prosecutor William McCauley said, noting that she had received financial assistance from her NFL star cousin.

She put Hernandez ahead of her 
children, who were ages four and seven at the time, McCauley said, even 
arranging for their care, knowing she risked imprisonment.

Singleton's attorney, E. Peter Parker, asked for a year of home confinement.

She also was ordered to have no contact with Hernandez, any other suspects or witnesses, except for her father, sister and two close friends

'She chose family loyalty . . . over civic duties,' a choice most people would make under similar circumstances, Parker said.

Prosecutors
 said Singleton has material information about Hernandez and the 
movements of his friends Ernest Wallace and Carlos Ortiz, who both 
pleaded not guilty to murder and accessory charges in the Lloyd killing.

Singleton
 also refused to testify in the Boston double killing case and is facing
 another contempt charge to which she intends to plead guilty.
