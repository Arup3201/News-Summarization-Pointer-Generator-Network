These dogs might just be proof that they really are a man's best friend.

Not only can they strip beds and fill laundry baskets, they can now load and empty washing machines with just a simple bark.

Their disabled owners have been handed a lifeline thanks to a revolutionary washing machine - which is activated their canine friend's bark.

Helping hand: Disabled people been handed a lifeline thanks to a 
revolutionary washing machine which is activated by a dog's bark

The ‘Woof to Wash’ enables specially trained dogs to unlock the machine with a bespoke foot pad and start it with a simple woof.

Clients aided by the Support Dogs charity - which provides canine assistants for people with disabilities, epileptics and children with autism - will now be able to benefit from the invention.

A doggy footpad and a microphone system have been added which recognise a dog’s bark.

This means that dogs are able to unlock the machine by pressing the pad with their paw, pull a rope with their mouths to open the machine, close the machine again with their nose, before activating the cycle by barking.

Measured amounts of detergent are automatically added from a storage bottle on the machine. 

Paws for thought: The 'Woof to Wash' machine enables specially trained dogs - which can already strip beds and fill laundry basket - to load and empty washing machines. They unlock the 
machine with a bespoke footpad (pictured) and and start it with a simple woof

Inventor John Middleton said: 'People who are visually impaired, have manual dexterity problems, autism or learning difficulties can find the complexity of modern day washing machines too much.

'I had been working on a single programme washing machine to make things easier, and there was a lot of demand for it.

'But then I saw a video from the charity Support Dogs, where a dog strips a bed and loads the washing machine.

'I was completely blown away by the footage and instantly thought I could invent a machine where the dog does everything.

After an initial meeting with Support Dogs, Mr Middleton, who is the Managing Director of UK laundry specialist JTM, set to work with a team of engineers and finished the project (with the help of manufacturer Miele Professional) in a fortnight.

Help: The charity's dogs are trained using voice commands and hand signals so they can help their owners fetch post, turn on light switches, open doors, assist in dressing and undressing - and now do a complete laundry cycle

Open wide: Dogs can also open the machine again with their nose, before activating the cycle by barking. Measured amounts of detergent are automatically added from a storage bottle on the machine

The invention has now been unveiled at the Support Dogs headquarters in Sheffield, with two year-old Golden Labrador Duffy doing the honours of demonstrating.

Mr Middleton said: 'The idea is to simply show what can be done - because the possibilities really are endless.'

Rita Howson, director of operations at Support Dogs, hailed the bark-activated washing machine and praised John for coming up with a simplified bespoke machine for their clients.

She said: 'A normal washing machine can be very challenging so the single programme machine is very helpful.

Inventor John Middleton said: 'People who are visually impaired, have manual dexterity problems, autism or learning difficulties can find the complexity of modern day washing machines too much. These dogs can help'

'But a lot of people we work with also have speech problems. For instance, some with cerebral palsy would have great difficulty so a voice-activated machine is handy.'

The charity’s dogs are trained using voice commands and hand signals so that they can help their owners fetch post, turn on light switches, open doors, assist in dressing and undressing and now do a complete laundry cycle.

Ms Howson added: 'What John has brilliantly come up with is to tailor make these machines to each individual’s needs.'

The small charity, set up in 1992, has trained over 200 dogs to date throughout the country and rely fully on volunteer donations.
