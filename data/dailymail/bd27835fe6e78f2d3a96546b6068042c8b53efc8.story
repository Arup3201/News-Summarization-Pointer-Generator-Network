Intricate: The CT scanner creates highly detailed images. Here, the blood vessels in the upper body, the heart and kidneys have been scanned

The world's quickest and and most detailed CT scanner that allows patients to watch T.V as they are X-rayed, has been installed in a Bradford hospital.

The £600,000 scanner is said to revolutionise medical technology.

It is able to perform up to 50 scans a day, compared to the 35 of the previous machine at Bradford Royal Infirmary, West Yorkshire.

The state-of-the-art equipment houses a television, which can show relaxation videos to nervous patients or children.

The scanner, which uses X-rays to produce sliced images of areas of the body, is designed to accommodate obese patients.

The machine can hold patients who weigh up to 27 stone.

Clinical
services manager Nigel Lewis, said: 'This 
machine is the first of its kind in the world and in an instant can 
provide 160 slice images of the body in just 0.35 seconds.

'It also uses a very low dose of radiation compared to older CT scanners.

'I
can't understate the benefits that the new scanner brings to the 
hospital and our patients and I can't overstate how good this equipment 
is.'

The Prime CT scanner 
provides radiographers and radiologists with a near-instant 160-slice 
image of the patient's body in just one rotation and provides more 
details than ever before.

The machine's coverage allows entire organs such as the heart to be scanned in just four heartbeats.

It also provides clinicians with 
sharper lung and excellent soft tissue detail in one image and image 
reading times have been shortened.

Consultant
radiologist Jonathan Barber, said; 'Such rapid imaging gives staff 
increased time to spend with patients and means scans can be acquired 
faster.

'We will be able to scan more patients than ever and the wider bore of the machine accommodates almost any patient type.'

High-tech: This patient will be able to watch television while they are X-rayed by the world's most detailed CT scanner

Manufacturer Toshiba has designated the hospital as a world reference site - a first for the UK.

It
means BRI is a centre of excellence and health professionals from all 
over the globe will travel to the city to see the scanner work.

Bradford Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust operates two CT scanners at the BRI and one at St Luke's Hospital, Bradford.

Efficient: 50 patients will now be able to be scanned each day at Bradford Royal Infirmary, freeing doctors up to spend more time with patients

Medical marvel: The new piece of technology will allow radiographers Josh Evans and Anne Williams to interpret images quicker
