The Army psychiatrist charged in the deadly 2009 Fort Hood shooting rampage says he'll use a 'defense of others' argument when he represents himself at his upcoming murder trial.

Maj. Nidal Hasan didn't elaborate when he announced his strategy today, shortly after a military judge agreed to allow him to represent himself.

But it was the first time Hasan hinted at his reasoning behind the attack that killed 13 people and wounded more than two dozen others on the Texas Army post.

Hasan also asked for a three-month delay to prepare his new defense. The judge, Col. Tara Osborn, said she would rule at a hearing Tuesday.

It's unclear if jury selection will still be held Wednesday as scheduled.

Hasan faces the death penalty or life without parole if convicted.

It was revealed last month, that Hasan has been paid $278,000 since the shooting on November 5, 2009.

Soldiers injured in the horrific attack at the Texas army base are fighting to receive the same pay and medical benefits as those injured in combat, but the Department of Defense confirmed that Major Nidal Hasan has continued to be paid.

The Army said that under the Military Code of Justice, unless Hasan is found guilty, his salary cannot be suspended.

Army Specialist Logan Burnett, who was shot three times at the Army Deployment Center, is appalled that the accused gunman is still being paid.Â

'There have been times when my wife and I
cannot afford groceries. We cannot afford gas in our car,' Mr Burnett, who has since retired, said. 'This makes me sick.'

If the army psychiatrist had been a civilian employee at the base, the Army could have suspended his pay after only one week, NBC5 Investigates said.

Personnel rules for most civilian 
government workers allow for 'indefinite suspensions' in cases 'when the
agency has reasonable cause to believe that the employee has committed a
crime for which a sentence of imprisonment may be imposed'.

The continued salary is just one of several battles victims of the shooting are fighting.

Because the Army classified the shooting as workplace violence rather than being combat related, and refuses to call it a terrorist attack, the gunman's victims have been denied benefits they would ordinarily be entitled to.

Under the combat related classification, servicemen would be entitled to the pay, Purple Heart retirement and medical benefits afforded to soldiers wounded in war, or during the 9/11 attacks on the Pentagon.

This means that Mr Burnett, who had been due to go to Iraq before the shooting, and the other victims and their families, are missing out of thousands of dollars in benefits and pay each year.

On the third anniversary of the shooting, victims filed a lawsuit against the Army to try to win back the rights to the benefits they claim they are entitled to.

Mr Burnett was appalled when he was shown a letter from the Department of Defense confirming Hasan had been paid more than $278,000. The letter was a response to a request by NBC5 Investigates under the Freedom of Information Act.
