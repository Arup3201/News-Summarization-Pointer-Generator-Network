Soil has been frozen to the bottom of the Greenland Ice Sheet for 2.7 million years, a study reveals. A piece of the GISP ice core is pictured

Scientists have discovered an ancient 'green' tundra landscape preserved below approximately two miles (3.2km) of ice.

The evidence suggests that the Greenland Ice Sheet has existed much longer than previously thought and has survived a number of periods of global warming.

‘We found organic soil that has been frozen to the bottom of the ice sheet for 2.7 million years,’ said University of Vermont geologist Paul Bierman.

Scientists are particularly interested in Greenland’s ice sheet as it is the second largest in the world.

Its future stability could have an enormous impact on how fast and high global sea levels rise from climate change.

The sheet's 656,000 square miles (1,055,000km) of ice could raise the global sea levels 23ft (7 metres) if they were to melt.

Dylan Rood a co-author on the study from the Scottish Universities Environmental Research Centre and the University of California, Santa Barbara, said: ‘The ancient soil under the Greenland ice sheet helps to unravel an important mystery surrounding climate change.'

The discovery suggests that even during the warmest periods since the vast ice sheet formed, the centre of Greenland remained stable.

Dr Bierman said: ‘It’s likely that it did not fully melt at any time, which allowed the tundra landscape to be locked away under the ice for millions of years.

The Greenland Ice Sheet is a vast body of ice covering 656,000 square miles (1,055,000km) of Greenland - approximately 80 per cent of the country's surface.

It is the second largest ice body in the world after the Antarctic Ice Sheet and is around the same size as Alaska.

The thickness of the ice is usually more than one mile (2km).

Some climate scientists argue that the ice is nearing a 'tipping point' where it could all melt in the next 2,000 years.

If the entire 684,000 cubic miles (2,850,000 cubic km) of ice did melt, it would lead to a rise in global sea levels of 23ft (7metres).

The new study suggests that the Greenland Ice Sheet has been around much longer than previously thought and that it was covered in green tundra around three millions years ago.

It is based on the examination of an ice core called GISP 2, which was taken in 1993.

University of Vermont graduate student Lee Corbett, explained: ‘The traditional knowledge about glaciers is that they are very powerful agents of erosion and can effectively strip a landscape clean.

'[Instead] we demonstrate that the Greenland Ice Sheet is not acting as an agent of erosion; in fact, at its centre, it has performed incredibly little erosion since its inception almost three million years ago.’

Dr Bierman described the ice sheet as a refrigerator that has preserved the landscape.

The scientists found the tundra by taking a fresh look at 17 ‘dirty ice’ samples from the deepest 40ft of the 10,019ft GISP2 ice core extracted in 1993.

They extracted a rare form of the element beryllium - an isotope called beryllium-10 – which was formed by cosmic rays and trapped in the soil and rock.

The longer soil is exposed at Earth’s surface, the more beryllium-10 it accumulates and measuring how much is soil or rock allows geologists to date the material.

Scientists are concerned about ice from the Greenland Ice Sheet melting because it could raise global sea levels significantly. These images show the extent of surface melt in July 2012 (from left to right)

The researchers expected to only find soil from eroded rocks, but instead discovered the silt had very high concentrations of the isotope, which they measured on a particle accelerator at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.

Joseph Graly who analysed the beryllium data, said: ‘On a global basis, we only find these sorts of beryllium concentrations in soils that have developed over hundreds of thousands to millions of years.’

The research shows that the soil has been stable and exposed at the surface for somewhere between 200,000 and one million years before it was covered with ice.

The team also measured nitrogen and carbon that could have been left by plant material in the core sample. The fact that measurable amounts of organic material were found in the silty ice suggests that the pre-glacial landscape may have been partially forested tundra.

Dr Rood said: ‘Greenland really was green! However, it was millions of years ago.

‘Greenland looked like the green Alaskan tundra, before it was covered by the second largest body of ice on Earth.’
