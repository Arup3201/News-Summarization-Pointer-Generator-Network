A rabbit was found locked inside a post box after being stolen from a garden hutch in a sick prank.

The frightened animal was discovered sitting on top of a pile of letters by a postman doing his final collection of the week last Saturday.

The family pet was shut inside the hot Royal Mail post box in Maltby, South Yorkshire, but survived its ordeal.

RSPCA staff managed to track down the rabbit’s owner after several members of the public offered to rehome the pet.

A spokesman for the animal welfare charity said the rabbit wouldn’t have been able to get out on its own.

Fortunately the rabbit was fine and had no injuries despite its ordeal, he said.

‘We managed to trace the owner who said that the rabbit had been taken from its hutch in her garden.

‘Clearly this was a silly prank that could have resulted in the rabbit being seriously hurt.’

A Royal Mail spokesman said: ‘It was certainly an unusual incident and we are just glad that the rabbit was fine and is now in safe hands.’

The picture has prompted outrage on social media after it was put out on Twitter.

Earlier this month thugs stole a rabbit from a hutch in Seaham, County Durham, and posted a video of it being tortured to death and thrown from a window.
