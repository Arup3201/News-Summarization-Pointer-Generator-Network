Guns: Adrian Golland, 71, who had his shotgun and two rifles taken away by police after he got into a row with a vicar over a sink he installed in a church

A canon at one of Britain's most-important cathedrals had two rifles and a shotgun seized by police worried about a bitter feud with a vicar sparked by a sink.

Adrian Golland, 71, a lay canon at Manchester Cathedral, became embroiled in a row with Reverend Nick McKee after installing a sink at the young vicar's church.

A court heard that when Rev McKee shut the area at his St Paul's Church, worried the sink's plug socket was unsafe, Mr Golland felt his 'reputation had been trashed.'

After the row descended into allegations of intimidation and recriminations, police visited Mr Golland and seized his gun collection.

Now he is fighting to have the confiscated a shotgun and two target-shooting rifles returned.

A two-day firearms licensing hearing at Bolton Crown Court heard that in March 2012, Rev McKee decided to shut the 'sink facility' at St Paul's Church, in Astley Bridge, Greater Manchester, deeming it dangerous.

Louise Brandon, for Greater Manchester Police, said Mr Golland had got a professional electrician to install an electrical socket by the sink, but Rev McKee was nonetheless convinced it was unsafe.

Mr Golland told Recorder of Bolton, Judge Timothy Clayson, that he believed Mr McKee was blaming him for problems with the project.

'My reputation at St Paul's had been seriously damaged by the closure of what was deemed to be my work,' he told the court. 'I valued my reputation and it had been trashed in the eyes of the congregation.'

Mr Golland was chairman of the church's building group and served on the parochial church council, but resigned these positions as a result of the dispute.

The judge, sitting with two magistrates on the appeal panel, were told that Mr Golland had meetings with senior Church of England clergy in an effort to air his grievances against Rev McKee.

But the court also heard his behaviour was causing tensions within the congregation at St Paul's - with allegations of him staring at Mr McKee during services and e-mails with other church members.

Despite the bad feeling, Mr Golland ignored a request by the archdeacon to stay away from St Paul's. Mr Golland explained: 'I was not prepared to be excluded from a church I had attended some 15 years longer than Rev McKee.'

The pensioner dismissed Miss Brandon's suggestions that the vicar had never been adversarial towards him and he was being paranoid. Instead Mr Golland claimed Rev McKee was behind a vendetta campaign against him.

The court was also told that police were called to Mr Golland's home in June 2013, by his wife Carol, who claimed he had assaulted her.

Mr Golland insisted that his wife of 41 years had 'exploded in a temper tantrum' after they returned home from the theatre and when he brushed past her she had fallen over.

The court Greater Manchester Police had attended the family home that evening but took no further action over the alleged incident.

But the firearms hearing heard that all these incidents - as well as contact from administrators at St Paul's - concerned police as they knew he owned target-shooting rifles and a shotgun.

St Paul's Church: Mr Golland ignored a request by the archdeacon to stay away from St Paul's

On December 6, last year, Greater Manchester Police's firearms licensing inquiry officer David Smith visited Mr Golland and in March this year his licence was revoked.

Police also served the pensioner with a 'police information notice', given to people where there are 'allegations of harassment'.

The court heard church officials were still so concerned about Mr Golland that they even requested a police presence at the church annual meeting.

Two officers attended the meeting on April 6, during which Mr Golland publicly raised the issue of his firearms being confiscated and asked for a statement from Mr McKee that he had never threatened violence towards the clergyman.

Judge Clayson and the magistrates will now consider all the evidence from the appeal and make a judgement on October 28.
