Buxton, 20, the No. 1-ranked young player in baseball, was starting his first game for the Rock Cats, the Double-A minor league affiliate for the Minnesota Twins, on Wednesday. 

Dom Amore, a sportswriter for the Hartford Courant described the collision as violent. He wrote on Twitter that, 'Buxton, who was parallel to the ground, appeared to hit his left shoulder/neck with RF mike kvasnicka's knee.' 

Twins general manager Terry Ryan happened to be at the game and rode in the ambulance to the hospital with Buxton, whom the Twins hope could soon be a key player for them. 

'I don't know if I've seen a collision that severe in recent memory,' Ryan told MLB.com.  

'But Byron Buxton's fine. He's alert. He has a concussion, so we'll have to take the normal procedure and protocol for concussion symptoms. He'll certainly be watched.'

Ryan called the top prospect a 'battler' and said he believe he'll be fine. The Twins hope the Buxton,  a speedy center fielder who can get on base and also hit for power, will be a key player for them in the coming years. 

Buxton had recently been promoted from a Single-A minor league team to Double-A. He had been fast-tracked to join the majors - as soon as this season - before he sustained a wrist injury during spring training caused him to miss most of the 2014 season.

The game against the Bowie Bay Sox was postponed for more than 30 minutes.

Kvasnicka managed to catch the ball, despite the collision. The Rock Cats won 8-5.
