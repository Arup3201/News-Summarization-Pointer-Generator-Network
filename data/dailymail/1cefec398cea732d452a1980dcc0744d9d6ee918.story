A 101-year-old woman has been evicted from her home of the last six decades after her son failed to pay property taxes on time.

Texana Hollis's possessions were thrown into dumpsters after bailiffs moved to take her house in Detroit, Michigan.

The 101-year-old was left in tears and disorientated after she was ordered out of the property that has been her home for the past 58 years.

Officials said her 65-year-old son Warren had failed to pay property taxes for up to seven years.

Although the home was owned outright by Ms Hollis he had ignored repeated warnings that they faced eviction.

Warren said: ‘I kept it from her because I did not want to worry her.’

He also admitted that he knew they faced eviction, but thought it would not happen.

Ms Hollis wept as she told her local TV station that she only found out about the back taxes the night before she was evicted.

Hours after being evicted Ms Hollis was rushed to hospital over fears she might have had a heart attack.

Friends later said did not suffer a heart attack, but was stressed over the incident.

With no place to stay a neighbour agreed to let Ms Hollis and her son stay at her home temporarily.

But neighbours are questioning why the local authority would want to turn a 101-year-old woman out on to the streets.

‘This woman needs to be back in her home now,’ one angry neighbour said.

Local businessmen are looking to see if they can pay the back taxes to allow Ms Hollis to move back into her home.
