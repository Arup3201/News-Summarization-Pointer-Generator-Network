A nasty race row has broken out over an Indian family becoming residents into Australia's long-running TV soap Neighbours.

The actor who plays an Indian father in Ramsay Street has hit out at fans who say it is 'un-Australian' to cast him, saying they probably supported the 'White Australia' policy.

Melbourne-born of Indian descent, Sachin Joab is part of the long-running TV soap's attempt to tackle perceptions the show is too white and doesn't represent modern Australia.

Yesterday, Neighbours staff Down Under were forced to remove several racist posts from fans angry a non-Anglo-Saxon family would become show regulars, writing 'that racism and small-mindedness won't be tolerated.'

Joab blamed racism on a 'lack of education.'

'There is various pockets that will say it is un-Australian to have an Indian or an Indian family on Ramsay St,' he said.

'Those Aussies who are saying it is 
un-Australian will be the same ones who pretty much supported the White 
Australia policy back in the day, you are never going to get away from 
that kind of stuff.'Â 

Joab said while most Australians were tolerant and respectful, he still faced bouts of racism.

'I
 faced racism myself, from the early years in primary school all the way
 up to recent times. Sometimes it's just blatant,' he said.

'I think having a show that shows different families coming together can only be good for the community.'

Neighbours executive producer Susan Bowers explained that the show wanted to represent a 'more modern society.'

Joab will be joined by Menik Gooneratne and Coco-Jacinta Cherian - together they will make up the Kapoor family.

'The
 ABC and SBS TV have always cast multi-cultural Australians, and it was 
only 20 years ago you put Greeks and Italians on TV and people would 
question it,' Ms Bowers said.

'We 
have been criticised heavily for being too white and you are damned if 
you do and if you don't, and we would much rather be criticised for 
moving in this direction.'

Ms Bowers said most of the inappropriate comments came from a 'small minority.'

But one British fan commented: 'I would also like to point out, this same post was put up on Neighbours UK and so far there has been no racist comments. Think a lot could be learnt from us Brits!'
