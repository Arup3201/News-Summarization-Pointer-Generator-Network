A father and daughter have been banned from keeping animals for life after they crammed 27 pets into their two bedroom semi.

Colin Hill, 65, and Lisa Hill, 31, kept the unhealthy animals in terrible conditions in their tiny house in Millfield, Sunderland.

The animals were covered in urine and faeces, some were underweight and some were overweight, had dental disease, matted fur and claws that were too long.

A Jack Russell dog called Bruno was unable to walk properly because his hind legs had turned inwards

The pair had previously admitted causing unnecessary suffering to Border Collie, Patch, and a black and white cat between April and June last year.

They also pleaded guilty to four counts of failing to ensure the welfare of a total of five dogs and 22 cats during the same period.

The duo were sentenced after the judge had adjourned the case for a pre-sentence report.

Appearing at Sunderland Magistrates Court, they were handed a three-months suspended jail term as well as the life time ban.

RSPCA prosecutor Denise Jackman said ten-year-old Patch was found when Lisa Hill tried to hide him in her bedroom.

The dog was suffering from severe paralysis and his fur was matted and stained with urine and faeces.

The cat was found covered in faeces in the rear yard, and its hind legs were so damaged it fell over several times when it tried to stand up.

Colin Hill said he had not noticed there was a problem. Both animals were put to sleep.

RSPCA inspectors said they were 'horrified and amazed' at how many animals were kept in the small property (above)

Mrs Jackman said RSPCA inspectors described the smell of ammonia in the house as 'intolerable' and that the floor had lifted clue to liquid damage, with the back yard covered in 'layers of faeces'.

All of the animals were signed over to the RSPCA.

Gavin Sword, defending, said the offences were born out of kindness, the pair having taken in unwanted animals.

'The impression that one gets is that they were simply overwhelmed by the number of animals,' he said.

'This was a two-bedroom house with three adults living in it and nearly 30 animals. It's clearly not adequate.

'When someone had an animal that wasn't wanted they could take it to the Hills.

'Ironically that was done out of kindness and goodness on their part, because they didn't want the alternative.

'They accept in hindsight that they should have sought veterinary attention, and, given their benefits status they could have gone to the PDSA.'

Mr Sword said that the pair had been left in fear of vigilante attacks and were scared to go out at night, adding that this had been a punishment in itself.

Appearing at Sunderland Magistrates Court, the pair were handed a three-months suspended jail term as well as a life time ban on keeping animals

Suspending the three-month prison sentences for one year, bench chairwoman Jean Brown said the pair would have to wait 10 years before appealing the life time ban on keeping animals.

They will be subject to a year's supervision and were ordered to each pay £1,359 in costs, at a rate of £10 per week.

Speaking after the case, RSPCA inspector Tony Jackman said: 'I was horrified and amazed at how many animals were in this really small property. There wasn't enough space for them to move around properly. The smell was overpowering.'

His colleague Helen Bestwick added: 'The sentence reflects the seriousness of this matter, and for them to get lifetime bans sends out a powerful message that this sort of cruelty will not be tolerated.'
