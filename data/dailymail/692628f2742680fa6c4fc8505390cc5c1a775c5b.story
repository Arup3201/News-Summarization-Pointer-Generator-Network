Former Chelsea and Liverpool midfielder Raul Meireles is well known for putting a lot of time into his appearance, whether it be his bushy beard, carefully constructed mohawk, or his ridiculous tattoos.

And the Portuguese 31-year-old has been flashing his latest ink additions as Portugal gear up for their second group game against Ghana.

Portugal lost their World Cup opener 4-0 against Germany, with centre back Pepe receiving a red card and face a tough task to turn around their fortunes in Group G.

Ink: Meireles has long been noted for his extravagant style and his tattoos are some of the World Cup's best

Faces: The full 'leg sleeve' tattoo features a rose on the midfielder's right knee above an old microphone

Faces: Meireles shows off two of the three faces pictures as part of the extravagant design

Meireles spent a year at Anfield with Liverpool before moving to Chelsea where he lifted the FA Cup and Champions League in 2012.

Roberto Di Matteo decided the hard-working midfielder was surplus to requirements with the European Champions though, and allowed Meireles to join Turkish club Fenerbahce for Â£8million

Meireles has long sported tattoos but his full-length leg design has only been around since Janunary - and he welcomed the new addition to his 'ink family' by posting a picture on Twitter, although he claimed not to be in any pain.

The tattoo includes the faces of three women, a pocket watch and one of Portuguese capital Lisbon's famous trams surrounded by musical notes and a black rose.

Hard to miss: Meireles stretches with team-mate Ricardo Costa and shows off the tattoo at the same time

Tweet: Meireles gave a preview of his tattoo online in January and claimed 'It does not hurt!'

Intricate design: Meireles' small socks worn in training gave a good view of his inked up limb
