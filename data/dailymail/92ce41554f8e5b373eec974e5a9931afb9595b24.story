Jordon Mutch will have a medical with QPR on Tuesday morning after Cardiff accepted a bid of £6million for the highly-rated midfielder. 

The 22-year-old's performances were one of the few highlights of Cardiff's Premier League season, but he is set to move on two years after joining from Birmingham for £2m.

Harry Redknapp is understood to have had a bid rejected for Mutch earlier in the summer.

Gary Medel's move to Inter Milan is also set to be completed after a £10m fee was agreed. The parties are yet to agree a timetable for payments.

Mutch will be the second player to leave relegated Cardiff for QPR this summer after Steven Caulker's £8m move. 

Along with Rio Ferdinand, he becomes the London club's third pre-season signing.
