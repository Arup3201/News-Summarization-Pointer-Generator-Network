The marksman who killed Mark Duggan (pictured) will be allowed to return to armed duties, it has emerged

The marksman who killed Mark Duggan will be allowed to have his gun back and return to armed police duties, it emerged last night.

The officer, granted anonymity and known as V53, was taken off armed duties after the incident in August 2011. And last week a jury decided his claim that Duggan was holding a gun when he was killed was incorrect.

However, he was judged to have killed lawfully, and commander Neil Basu, head of armed policing in London, told the Guardian: ‘If he volunteered to carry a firearm again I would want him to do that.’

The paper reported that police have contacted the family to say preparations are underway to reinstate V53 as an armed officer.

The family described the decision as an ‘insult’.

The news comes after the coroner who led the inquest revealed he is to ask Duggan's family for their views on how armed police should tackle dangerous criminals.

Keith Cutler, a judge who sat as coroner at the inquest at the Royal Courts of Justice, said the dead man’s family will be invited to submit their ideas on potential reforms to high-risk operations.

The circuit judge said the ‘unusual, perhaps unique’ decision could influence his recommendations.

The findings, which are likely to 
focus on the use of body-worn cameras, training and police statements, 
will be presented to the Home Secretary next month.

But
 the move is likely to provoke outrage from the police rank-and-file, 
some of whom question why the Duggan family has been treated with ‘kid 
gloves’.

One official 
close to the Met’s inquest team said: ‘It’s the equivalent of asking the
 families of murder victims to rule on sentencing policy. This is hard 
to swallow.’

Judge Cutler 
has already faced questions about his handling of the inquest, 
particularly after its final moments descended into near anarchy at the 
High Court.

Duggan’s younger brother Marlon had 
to be physically restrained as he shouted abuse and threats in the wake 
of the lawful killing ruling.

The
 three-month inquest was marred by the constant barracking of witnesses 
by supporters of Duggan and began with a 20-second silence held in his 
memory.

Speaking
 publicly for the first time yesterday, Judge Cutler said he wants 
‘transparency for all parties and the public’ over his recommendations.

‘In that spirit I am taking the unusual,
 perhaps unique, step of inviting submissions from all the interested 
parties including the Duggan family,’ he said.

Defending the 20-second 
silence, Judge Cutler, 63, added: ‘I thought that a few moments 
reflection at the start of the inquest might be quite healing.’

Meanwhile, an MP boycotted a vigil for Duggan because he feared it would be hijacked by violent mobs.

David Lammy said he refused to ‘share a platform’ with criminals seeking to take advantage of anger over the inquest into his death.
