Life was looking up for 18-year-old Wayne Jowett as he saw in the New Year with his friends. The handsome teen had been in remission with leukaemia for six months and had just two bouts of chemotherapy left to go.

He was looking forward to playing rugby and hockey again, had passed his driving test and was proving popular with girls. The apprentice mechanic also had plans to work in New Zealand.

But all that came to a stop just four days later when a doctor wrongly ordered that the powerful chemotherapy drug, vincristine, should be injected into Wayne's spine instead of a vein.

This mistake by Dr Feda Mulhem cost Wayne his life. It slowly destroyed his spinal cord and nerves, killing him a month later.

His father and mother could only watch helplessly. At one point, Wayne was in such pain he begged for mercy.

'In the final minutes before he lost consciousness, Wayne looked up at me as I held him in my arms,' says his mother Stella. 'He cried: “Mum, what have they done to me? Am I dying?” '

Wayne died a few days before his 19th birthday. Nearly 13 years later, Stella, 53, weeps as she recalls his final days.

Dr Mulhem pleaded guilty to manslaughter and was jailed for eight months.

Between 1975 and 2001, 14 patients died after the same fatal chemotherapy error. In 2001, an official inquiry made 50 recommendations to prevent similar tragedies.

Led by Professor Brian Toft, emeritus professor of patient safety at Coventry University, the inquiry called for separate storage areas for spinal and intravenous drugs, and different times for dispensing them.

All but one of the recommendations have been put in place.

But alarmingly, a similar tragedy could still easily happen again, warns Professor Toft.

It's down to the health service dragging its feet over changing its reliance on a simple plastic device, known as a Luer connector.

Luer connectors attach syringes, catheters and needles into drips in a patient's vein, spine, muscle or skin

This small tube-like connector is the standard means of attaching syringes, catheters and needles into drips in a patient's vein, spine, muscle or under their skin.

The universal, fit-all connectors have been used in hospitals since they were designed in 1896. They are part of 700,000 spinal and epidural procedures each year, as well as countless intravenous drips.

Thanks to the implementation of 49 of Professor Toft's recommendations, there have been no more fatal chemotherapy errors  in Britain since Wayne's death.

However, there have been deaths due to other drugs being administered via the wrong route, says Professor Toft.

In 2004, Mayra Carbrera, a 30-year-old theatre nurse, suffered a fatal heart attack an hour after giving birth to her son Zachary at the Great Western Hospital in Swindon, where she worked.

Instead of a saline solution to help her blood pressure, the powerful anaesthetic bupivacaine was administered via an intravenous drip (this drug should not be given in this way). The hospital was fined £100,000.

To prevent these wrong route  errors, in 2009 the health watchdog the National Patient Safety  Agency advised the NHS to switch to safer non-Luer connectors (NLCs).

Developed and invented in Britain, these cost the same as the old devices, but their special lock design means medicines intended to be injected into a vein can't be put into the spine and vice versa.

'It is the equivalent to stopping you putting diesel in a petrol car - except we are talking about human life,' says Professor Toft, who is chairman of the NHS England reference group for safer neuraxial (spinal) devices.

The NHS set a target date of April 2012 for all hospitals to get the new connectors, yet figures show just 70 trusts in England are using them - 90 still do not. Not a single trust in Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland uses them.

'We are the world leader in this new equipment, but the trusts say they are waiting until the Geneva-based International Standards Organisation publishes its seal of approval for a non-Luer connector, but that could take years,' says Professor Toft.

'Yet the safer connector could be used in every hospital today. The delay in bringing in a simple life-saving solution is frustrating.'

In just one year in England and Wales, there were 19 reports of  wrong route errors.

Professor Toft warns: 'The NHS could be sued for clinical negligence if a patient dies and a trust has not used an NLC.

'There is a need for action before  another Wayne Jowett tragedy happens.'

Behind Professor Toft's 11-year campaign to improve safety in this area is a pledge he made to Wayne's father, also called Wayne, and Stella.

'They are a lovely family and what their son went through was heart-rending. I promised them I would do my utmost to ensure another person would not die like him.'

Wayne first became ill in the summer of 1999, coming home early from a night out because he was feeling shattered.

'He slept most of the weekend and on Monday, when he couldn't lift his head off the pillow, we called the GP,' says Stella, who lives in Keyworth, Notts.

'He took one look at him, did a blood test and said: “Get him to the hospital now.” '

His father recalls the day they found out Wayne had leukaemia.

'I told him he had cancer, but it was treatable. He cried, but when he asked “Am I going to get through this, Dad?”, I said: “Of course you are” and gave him a cuddle,' says Wayne senior, 54.

'Somehow we coped with each stage of treatment. He never complained - he was a lovely lad.'

For Wayne's penultimate chemo-therapy session, he was due to be given two anti-cancer drugs:  cytosine, to be injected into the spine that day, January 4, 2001; and vincristine, injected into a vein the next day.

But after just two days working at Queen's Medical Centre in Nottingham, registrar Dr Mulhem didn't read the warnings on the syringe of vincristine that stated it was for intravenous (into the vein) use only. Nor did he look at Wayne's medical records.

Instead, he ordered a junior doctor to put both drugs into Wayne's spine. The junior asked him twice if this was correct, a nurse also challenged him and even Wayne quizzed him about it as he'd had these treatments before.

Despite this, Dr Mulhem ordered the junior doctor to go ahead. Only after this had been done did he read the drugs chart.

Staff in the intensive care unit tried desperately to flush out the drug, injecting fluids into the top of Wayne's spine and placing a drain at the bottom, but it didn't work.

'The vincristine sent his whole body into agonising cramps and he was screaming in pain,' says his father.

'About six staff were holding him down in bed as he was trying to get out of it, begging us to help him.

'I pleaded with them to give him something, but they said they couldn't as they would not be able to assess how bad the situation was. I held him firmly while trying to reassure him he would be OK.'

Wayne's parents were then called into the intensive care consultant's office, where he told them bluntly that their son was going to die.

'He told us a pinprick of the drug is enough to paralyse you - Wayne had the full quota. It clings to the muscles and can't be flushed out. He said Wayne had no chance,' says his father.

Within the next few days, their son lost all feeling in his legs and was paralysed from the waist down.

As Wayne was 18, the medics said he had to be told he was dying. His father was against this, but Stella decided she owed it to her son to be honest.

'We believe he would have got over the cancer and I felt he had a right to know what the hospital had done to him,' she says.

As he lapsed into a coma, she told him: 'I am so sorry, but they have poisoned you.'

Wayne's final words were: 'Get the b******s for me, Mum.'

After he lost consciousness, his parents maintained a 24-hour vigil, reassuring him, playing his favourite Oasis tracks and telling him how much they loved him.

Eventually, they agreed that his life-support machine should be turned off. Wayne died on February 2 as his parents clasped his hands.

'I would not want anyone, parent or child, to go through what we experienced,' says his father.

Last month, Professor Toft met MP Stephen Dorrell, chairman of the Health Select Committee, and wrote to Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt and other leading health chiefs, informing them there was an unacceptable delay in getting all trusts to use non-Luer connectors.

'Mr Dorrell told me the Chief Inspector for Hospitals, Sir Mike Richards, will insist hospitals introduce them as each is inspected.'

Indeed, yesterday the Mail learned that hospitals are being given a third warning that they should be using NLCs, with a timetable of three months.

After years of delay, Professor Toft believes that now there will be a massive improvement in the take-up rate. If not, enforcement notices can be issued.

'I welcome the Daily Mail's endeavours to bring this situation to the public's attention. It has shone a light on an area that badly needs it,' he says. 'And I feel more hopeful that I can keep my promise to Wayne's parents.'
