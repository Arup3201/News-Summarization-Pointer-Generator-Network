The global list of the great and good attending today's memorial event for Nelson Mandela in South Africa reads like a Who's Who of world leaders in politics, business, music and fashion.

As tens of thousands of South Africans converged in sorrow, celebration and pride on Soweto's World Cup stadium, they found themselves taking their seats side-by-side with presidents, priests and queens at a memorial service for the global icon.

Representing the U.S., President Barack Obama has flown in for the day of remembrance and celebration for the anti-apartheid icon who died last week at age 95.

Air Force One touched down at a military base near Johannesburg on a rainy morning.

Joining Obama on the 16-hour trip from Washington was first lady Michelle Obama, former President George W. Bush and his wife, Laura, and former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton.

Former Presidents Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter were also scheduled to attend the memorial service, but traveled to South Africa separately.

French President Francois Hollande and his predecessor Nicolas Sarkozy will attend as will the German President Joachim Gauck.

Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe and Cuban President Raul Castro were also pictured arriving at the stadium.

The President of the Palestinian Authority Mahmoud Abbas accepted the invitation, but Israel's top leaders were conspicuous by their absence.

Israel announced neither Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu nor President Shimon Peres will attend the event citing costs and health reasons.

Tycoon Sir Richard Branson, supermodel Naomi Campbell and musicians Bono, Annie Lennox and Peter Gabriel are among those expected at the memorial service.

Sir Richard and singer Peter Gabriel devised 'The Elders' forum of statesmen and activists set up by Mr Mandela.

U2 singer and activist Bono, 53, said the anti-apartheid icon had inspired him to campaign against Aids and world poverty.

He took his seat next to South African actress Charlize Theron.

Miss Campbell, 43, who Mr Mandela described as his 'honorary granddaughter', has helped raise money for the Nelson Mandela Children's Fund and his former political party the African National Congress.

Grammy-award winning artist Annie Lennox, 58, has a long association with Mr Mandela after performing at his 70th birthday concert in 1988.

U.S. talk show host Oprah Winfrey will also be there.

Three previous British Prime Ministers - Sir John Major, Tony Blair and Gordon Brown - are to join current PM David Cameron at the official memorial ceremony.

Also at the national memorial service in Johannesburg's FNB Stadium are Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg and Leader of the Opposition Ed Miliband.

It is thought to be the first time for many years that all of the UK’s surviving prime ministers have travelled to an event abroad, and reflects the deep respect in which Mr Mandela is held within British politics.

Mr Obama will lead the tributes along with United Nations secretary-general Ban Ki-moon.

Russia's President Vladimir Putin, who is not attending, described Mandela as a 'great humanist' as he signed a book of condolence at the South African embassy in Moscow.

Having signed the book, Putin bowed his head in front of Mandela’s portrait and offered condolences to South African Ambassador Mandisi Mpahlwa.

At the funeral on Sunday, political guests will include Czech Foreign Minister Jan Kohout – who is representing his country in place of its prime minister Jiri Rusnok.

Mr Rusnok was forced to apologise after he was recorded saying: 'The idea of going gives me the shivers.'

South African President Jacob Zuma will 
give the keynote address and former South African President F.W. de Klerk will play a major part.

Mr Mandela's family and friends also will 
speak at the ceremony, which will include a sermon.
