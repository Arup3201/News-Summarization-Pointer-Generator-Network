A judge is allowing a jailed Utah woman a goodbye visit from the baby she stands accused of dumping  in a trashcan and leaving to die.

Alicia Englert will have one supervised 90-minute visit with the now 3-month-old baby, Judge Elizabeth Hruby-Mills decided during a conference in her chambers Monday.

Prosecutor Robert Parrish said he opposed the visit because Englert never had a relationship with the child.

The girl is in the process of being adopted by another family after the 23-year-old woman waived her parental rights a few weeks ago.

'I'm pretty sure Alicia said goodbye to the baby when she put the baby in the neighbor's trash can,' Parrish said. Other members of her family also will be allowed to attend the visit, scheduled for Monday.

Defense attorney Weyher Fulkerson said in a statement the case is complicated and very sad, and the visit is separate from the criminal proceedings. 

Parrish said the visit was granted as an exception to a no-contact order in the case.

Prosecutors say Englert gave birth at her home in the Salt Lake City suburb of Kearns. She left the baby without food or medical care for at least a day before wrapping her in a towel and abandoning her in the trash August 26, police said.

Prosecutors say the baby would have died if she hadn't been found by a neighbor who thought she heard a purring cat. The girl was inside a trashcan under bags of garbage and suffering from hypothermia, respiratory distress and a blood-borne infection.

She was flown to a hospital and recovered after she was placed on a ventilator. Parrish said Tuesday the baby is doing well.

Englert faces an attempted murder charge in the case, and a review is expected to determine whether she's mentally competent to stand trial. She was released on bail in October. If convicted, Englert faces up to life in prison.

Englert's family has said she has a learning disability, didn't know she was pregnant and couldn't understand why what she did was wrong.

Elizabeth Sollis, spokeswoman for the Utah Division of Child and Family Services, said goodbye visits are fairly common for parents whose rights are terminated after their children are taken into state custody. The visits are supervised by social workers.

In August, Fox13 published a photo album of Englert allegedly drinking alcohol, dancing and clubbing - 'potentially within the same window of time that she was pregnant,' the station said.

The affiliate station also reported on Englert's 'Meet Me :)' profile, which stated she didn't have any children.

In full, her 'About Me' section read, 'hi my name is alicia im 23 years old I work full time I have brown hair im 5'1 I have no kids I do drink but only on the weekends I have my own car I still live with my mom and dad for now!!! if you want to know more just ask ;)'

Fox13 said its Facebook commenters, responding to Englert's story, said 'they don't believe she has severe learning disabilities because she had a driver's license, drove her own car, was normal at work and 'partied a lot.''

In August, Salt Lake County Attorney Sim Gill outlined the days prior to and of the birth.

Gill offered new details about what happened in the 36 hours leading up to the baby being found by a neighbor in the Salt Lake City suburb of Kearns.

Englert gave birth in a bathroom inside the house she lived in with her family around midnight on Aug. 24, Gill said. She wrapped the baby in a towel and left it on the floor of the basement bathroom, he said.

Englert left for work the following day, leaving the baby alone without feeding her or getting her any care. She came back home that night and left the baby on the floor. The next morning, Englert put the baby in her neighbor's trash can just before 6 a.m., Gill said.

A neighbor heard sounds of what she thought was a purring cat in her trash can. When she moved several trash bags, she spotted the baby, Gill said. She couldn't get the baby out and ran next door for help.

There, she found Englert's father, Robert Englert, who helped get the baby out of the trash can. Emergency responders put the baby on a life-flight helicopter.

The baby was dirty, smelly and had a blood-borne infection, Gill said. 'If the baby had not been discovered and not received medical condition, it certainly would have died,' he said.

Investigators don't believe other family members knew about the baby being in the house, Gill said.

Robert Englert has said previously his daughter has a learning disability and has only recently begun to understand what she has done.
