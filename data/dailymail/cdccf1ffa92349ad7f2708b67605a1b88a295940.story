As they posed for a celebratory selfie to mark their 4-0 win against Malaysia at the Commonwealth Games, these two Australian hockey players probably didn't think their day could get any better.

Little did they know their selfie was about to be given the royal seal of approval as the Queen joined in the latest social media craze and 'photobombed' them.

The Queen, who met the Hockeyroos after their match, poked her head into the background of the photo and smiled for the camera.

The Queen joined in with the latest craze when she photobombed a 
selfie taken by two players, Jayde Taylor, left and Brooke Peris, right, from the Australian women's hockey team on 
the first day of the Commonwealth Games

A second player, Anna Flanagan, tweeted a photo of Her Majesty posing 
in the background of the team's selfie, writing 'What a day!! 4-0 win 
over Malaysia... And we just met the QUEEN!!!'

England hurdler Andy Turner also tried his hand at getting the Queen to photobomb, 
posting on Twitter: 'That's as good as it gets, some big bloke told me 
to jog on so thought it was time I moved'

Despite having just won their opening match of the Games, the Australian players could hardly contain their excitement - and their shock that the Queen had 'even smiled'.

Jayde
 Taylor, who is pictured posing in the selfie with teammate Brooke Peris, immediately tweeted the 
photo.

The 
29-year-old told her 2,300 followers: 'Ahhh The Queen photo-bombed our 
selfie!! #royalty #sheevensmiled #amazing #Glasgow2014'. 

Dressed in green and a matching turquoise hat, Her Majesty was seen mischievously lurking in the background of the selfie at the Glasgow National Hockey Centre. 

The Queen was captured in the photo as she arrived at the centre for the first day of the 2014 Commonwealth Games.

The photo immediately swept the micro-blogging site, being retweeted thousands of times in one hour, complete with the hashtag #queenselfie.

Her teammate Anna Flanagan also 
tweeted: 'What a day!! 4-0 win over Malaysia... And we just met the 
QUEEN!!! #queenselfie #roovolution'

Jayde Taylor said: 'Brooke [Peris] and I planned it so that when she came out the door she would be behind us.

'And then she came out and smiled at the camera. We were in the right spot at the right time.'

The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh were visiting the National Hockey Centre at Glasgow on the opening day of the Games

Her Majesty seemed to be enjoying the action as she watched England beat Wales 2-0

The duo quickly became a target for selfie-taking sports stars who wanted the Queen to photobomb their pictures

Following their first game against Malaysia, the team were greeted by the monarch. The Queen spoke to Georgie Parker who had an ice pack on her leg.

She told the player: 'You're all very tough. It looks dangerous.'

She also told the sportswomen she had never played hockey herself, but that Philip had.

Miss Taylor said: 'We were warming down on the second pitch after our game and the 
Queen came out to meet Donny [Madonna Blyth, Australian women's hockey 
captain]. 

'She asked us a bit about the pitch, how we were going and told us to enjoy our time here. She was lovely, really, really lovely.'

Meanwhile, England hurdler Andy Turner also posted a selfie with the Queen at the Games.

As the Queen walked past in the background, he snapped a selfie and then wrote on Twitter: 'That's as good as it gets, some big bloke told me to jog on so thought it was time I moved.'

He had previously warned his followers: 'Today's the day I have lunch with the queen, today's the day I also try to take a selfie with the queen! This could go very wrong lol'.

The Queen shared a joke with some of the other spectators during the first day of the Games

She seemed to be taking the game seriously, while the Duke of Edinburgh watched on in fascination

The Queen and Prince Phillip, Duke of Edinburgh, were at the centre for the first day of the 20th Commonwealth Games.

The duo met with volunteers as the Glasgow National Hockey Centre, before settling down to watch England's opening game against Wales.

The Queen was seen frowning and grinning as she took in all the action of the England team's 2-0 win. 

The royal, who will travel to Balmoral 
for her annual summer stay following today's engagements, wore a green 
crepe coat by Karl Ludwig, a floral silk dress and a blue hat with green
 trim by Angela Kelly.

She also sported a thistle brooch, one of a set of four pins gifted to her by the Sultan of Oman.

The Queen spent the day at the Commonwealth Games Village in Glasgow and was given a gift from Sierra Leone

The Queen was introduced to Games volunteers by Alex Salmond, 
Scotland's First Minister at the Tollcross International Swimming 
Centre
