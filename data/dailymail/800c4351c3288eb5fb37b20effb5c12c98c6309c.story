SPOILER ALERT!

A Desperate Housewives producer revealed an upcoming plot twist as they announced one of the major characters will be killed off in an episode airing in America this Sunday.

George Perkins let slip that it will be James Denton's character Mike Delfino who dies in the upcoming episode.

Coincidentally, the revelation came less than an hour after Denton took to the stand in the ongoing legal battle between his show's creator Marc Cherry and his former co-star Nicollette Sheridan.

Suits you, madam! Nicollette Sheridan arrived at court in L.A today looking as sharp and elegant as always

Denton says the death of Sheridan's 
character on Desperate Housewives wasn't shocking to him because the 
series has featured so many characters who have been killed off.

Denton testified briefly today during
the trial, saying he was also unaware of Sheridan's allegations that 
series creator Marc Cherry had hit her until months after the incident.

The actor, who rehearsed and 
shot with Sheridan the day of her dispute with Cherry, told the jury he 
didn't learn of Britt's death until he received a script detailing it 
the following year.

'I can't say I was shocked, only because people get killed so often,' he testified.

Not shocked: James Denton testified that there was nothing off about Sheridan's exit

The actor was called by defence lawyers for Cherry, but Denton says he doubts his testimony 'helped or hurt anybody.'

He also said fittingly: '(The show) changes so quickly that we always joke that nobody’s safe.'

He told jurors he has great affection for both Sheridan and Cherry.

Denton, who plays Mike Delfino and other Housewives actors are currently filming the final shows of series.

He plays the husband of Teri Hatcher's
character, Susan, but during their long-term story arc he was involved 
with Sheridan's character, Edie Britt, and therefore worked closely with
her.

Sheridan's role was killed off in 
season five and she claims it was in retaliation for her complaint that 
Cherry hit her, which the writer and executive producer denies.

Anger didn't factor into the decision to kill off Sheridan's role, the series creator testified today.

Marc Cherry concluded his testimony in
the actress' wrongful termination case by denying claims by Sheridan's 
attorneys that he tried to influence the statements of other employees 
on the show to fit his version of the dispute.

Cherry and other witnesses have said 
approval to kill off Sheridan's character Edie Britt was given in May 
2008, four months before the actress accused Cherry of striking her hard
in the head during a discussion of a scene.

Cherry testified that he was simply trying to convey some direction to the actress on how to use physical humour.

Co-stars: Denton was filming with Sheridan on the day of the alleged head-tapping incident, but claims he only knew about it months later

She wears it well: Sheridan has a different couture suit for her each day, the actress certainly knows how to work a stage

Sheridan, 48, told jurors last week 
she was stunned and humiliated by the blow, which she described as a 
wallop, and that Cherry appeared nervous when he informed her in 
February 2009 that her character was going to die.

Jurors have been presented plenty of evidence about the many deaths of Desperate Housewives.

They are frequently told 48 characters
have been killed on the series, and were shown a montage of the various
methods, including beatings, shootings, car crashes, stabbings and in 
Britt's case, electrocution.

Denton agreed with Sheridan's attorney that Britt was the most prominent character to be killed off.

'They were relieved': Marc Cherry has said that Eva Longoria and Felicity Huffman were happy to learn Sheridan was getting axed from the show

He and other actors are currently 
filming the final episodes of the series and the case has been talked 
about on the set. 'It's really disappointing for us,' Denton said.

Denton's testimony provided more star 
power to the case but didn't contribute to mounting conflicting evidence
jurors will have to sift through when testimony concludes next week.

The actress' attorneys have suggested 
that Cherry and other Desperate Housewives workers altered their stories
about the timing of the decision to kill off Britt.

More details to come: Sheridan's attorneys called Cherry as 
the trial's second witness, and he is adamant that he did not axe her in retaliation for any complaint

Scene of the showdown: Sheridan and Cherry are battling it out at the Los Angeles Superior Court

The veteran TV writer denied their 
claims Thursday, saying he made no efforts to influence a long list of 
other people who worked on the show.

Cherry and two witnesses say top ABC 
executives gave approval in May 2008, although a former writer and 
co-executive producer testified Wednesday that she didn't hear any 
discussions about killing off Britt until December 2008.

The show, which started to much fanfare and praise in 2004 is in its final season.

Battle: Sheridan 
took to the stand on Friday and claimed that Cherry deliberately didn't 
give her character any funny lines

Giving evidence: Court papers show the names of stars from Desperate Housewives who will be called for the defense

Written out: Sheridan's character Edie Britt was killed off in 2009 when her character was electrocuted following a car crash

No research: Potential jurors were told not to watch Desperate 
Housewives at the end of day two in the Nicollette Sheridan versus Marc 
Cherry legal battle

They're more likely to be found around an achingly trendy pool, or being fitted with impractical shoes on Rodeo Drive... but Nicollette and Lindsay Lohan have become pioneers of an unlikely legal chic trend.

And while they may not have wanted to appear in court in the first place, 25-year-old Lindsay perhaps more vehemently than Nicollette, they'll be damned if they don't use the opportunity as a showcase.

L.A law: Lindsay Lohan and Nicollette both bring the same kind of platinum blonde starlet glamour to their appearances at court in California

And so they should, both starlets found themselves in the drama keg that is a courtroom at a time when their careers were nothing short of moribund.

It's given Lohan's career CPR, being reprimanded so publicly while she pouts like the starlet the world never knew it wanted until now, and it could revive Sheridan's prospects if she plays her cards right.

Whatever happens, both platinum blondes have looked spectacular in tailored clothes and vertiginous pumps that never veered towards stripper territory.

These unfortunate sets of circumstances have given two great actresses, who lost their way for various reasons, a chance to shine again... albeit on an unlikely stage.
