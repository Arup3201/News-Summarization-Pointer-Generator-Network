Denial: Michael Le Vell, pictured yesterday, says he is not a drug addict as he faces showdown talks with Corrie bosses before he returns to the soap

Soap star Michael Le Vell has declared: 'I am not a drug addict' after it emerged he took cocaine before his sex abuse trial because his life had sunk to its 'lowest ebb'.

The actor, 49, is expected to return to Coronation Street in the next month but will be warned by ITV bosses this is his last chance after well-known problems with alcohol and now drug abuse.

Mr Le Vell, who plays mechanic Kevin Webster, last night blamed his ex-girlfriend for forcing him to reveal his cocaine use, but maintains it only happened once.

'I am not denying it. When you get 
caught you have to hold your hands up. But believe me I am not a drug 
addict or a regular user,' he told the Daily Star.

The star was cleared of 12 child sex charges, including 
rape, last year, and has pointed the finger at a former lover for forcing him to reveal his drug use.

He is now in a relationship with new girlfriend Louise Gibbons, 38, and says that he regrets taking a Class A drug in a 'moment of weakness'.

'Stupidly I tried it. It was a stupid mistake. But that episode is all behind me now. My life is now back on track, with a great girl at my side, after two years of stress', he said.

Coronation Street has a history of standing by its stars after revelations about drug use.

Actor and DJ Craig Charles, who plays popular cab driver Lloyd Mullaney, was temporarily thrown off the soap in 2006 when he was caught smoking crack. But he was given his job back.

Steve McDonald actor Simon Gregson was asked to leave after it emerged that he was spending £1,000 a month on cocaine, before he returned.

Jimmi Harkishin, 54, who plays Dev Alahan, was also written out when he was caught out taking cocaine.

Le Vell  said he tried cocain after a friend offered it and said yesterday: ‘I never thought I was the sort of 
bloke.

Le
 Vell faced a two-year nightmare from the time he was first accused of 
sex assaults in September 2011 until he was cleared last year.

After
 his first arrest prosecutors said they had dropped the case months 
later — but in February last year he was charged with a string of 
historic offences.

Last
 month, Le Vell reportedly had a showdown with worried family members 
after concerns his drinking session were affecting his work, but the actor denied his habit had led to drug-taking.

There were claims he would reach a local pub at around Midday most days and stay there.

His trial heard him open up about 
his alcohol consumption, with the actor admitting he contacted 
Alcoholics Anonymous after developing a habit where he drank up to nine 
pints every night.

The show's bosses gave him six months to 
recover from the trial, and it was alleged they had offered him help to 
quit the habit.

A friend said he knows this is his last chance, adding: 'He needs to cut down on his boozing and focus on his career'.

After his arrest, scriptwriters explained 
away Le Vell's absence by saying his character was in Germany visiting 
his father, but he will return to the screen full time this spring.

On his return to the show, he will reportedly aim to rebuild his 
relationship with his on-screen ex-wife Sally, played by Sally Dynevor, who has 
meanwhile been dating Tim Metcalfe.

Stuart Blackburn, Coronation Street’s 
executive producer, told The Mirror: ‘I can’t wait to have Michael back –
 We were all watching the news for the end of the trial and there were 
cheers going up around the set when the result came through. It was just
 a sense of relief.

‘The new set is like a fresh new start for Michael, it’s all about the future now.’

A spokesman for ITV said: 'We will be meeting with Michael to discuss this situation.'
