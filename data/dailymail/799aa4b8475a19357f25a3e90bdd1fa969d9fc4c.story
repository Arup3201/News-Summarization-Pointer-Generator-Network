In-form centre Jonathan Joseph has renewed his contract with Bath.  The 23-year-old has scored seven tries in 15 games for Bath this season and his performances earned him a call-up by England coach Stuart Lancaster as injury cover ahead of the QBE Autumn Internationals.

Joseph did not play in any of those matches but has won six England caps in total since making his international debut against South Africa in 2012.

A Bath statement did not include any details about Joseph's new contract but the Derby-born back, who moved to The Rec from London Irish in 2013, said: 'I feel I've really developed as a player since I've been here at Bath.

Joseph made his international debut against South Africa at Ellis Park in the summer of 2012 

'With the help of the great coaches here I've added more elements to my skillset, so I definitely wanted to stay here.'

Head coach Mike Ford added: 'JJ is an incredibly talented young player, who is on the brink of breaking into the England squad, and deservedly so.

'He has been on fantastic form for us, providing a real threat in our back line and his defence is international class too. He's matured as a player over the last year or so, and we're delighted he's staying with us.'

Bath head coach Mike Ford was thrilled to hold onto Joseph who has been in blistering form this season
