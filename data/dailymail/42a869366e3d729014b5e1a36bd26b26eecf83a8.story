The boyfriend of Bobbi Kristina Brown has told friends of his anguish at being banned from visiting her as she fights for life.

Nick Gordon has been in hiding since his girlfriend was discovered lying face down in a bathtub on January 31.

Detectives have launched an investigation into how the daughter of the late singer Whitney Houston was found with injuries on her chest, as well as additional bruises on her mouth and face.

But Gordon,25, has insisted it was wrong to blame him for the 21-year-old heiress's condition and that he desperately wanted to be allowed to see her.

It has emerged that one of Nick and Bobbi’s neighbors reported a domestic dispute at her address the week before she was found

Sole sighting: Nick Gordon was only seen visiting Bobbi Houston's hospital once, one the day after she was found drowned. He is now pleading to be allowed to see her and denies harming her

Vigil: Bobbi Kristina's relatives, including her maternal grandmother, Cissy Houston (pictured), have been at her bedside since the drowning

Visiting: Bobbi Kristina's father Bobby Brown visits his daughter on Thursday

He told a friend: 'I didn't do anything to my baby.

'I just hope she wakes up and tells 'em what they all need to know.

'People are just jumping on my back cos she loves me. There's a load of nonsense being said about us. I love her, but I can't get anywhere near her.'

Gordon has opened up discussions with Bobbi's family to try to persuade them to allow him to see his girlfriend who has described him as her husband, although any marriage has been denied by her family.

There has only been one public visit to her bedside by Gordon, one the day after she was found drowned at the home they shared.

Since then he has not been seen at the hospital where she is being treated, although her father Bobby Brown, grandmother Cissy Houston and other relatives have been seen arriving or leaving the hospital virtually every day.  

The source said: 'He is frustrated, missing her and has had to sit back and feels helpless about everything. He just wants to be with her.'

Bobbi's cousin Jered Brown claimed Gordon was taking legal action to force the hands of her family to allow him to visit the young woman who has been in a medically induced coma since being found unresponsive at her Atlanta home.

But Gordon denied any legal moves last night and was said to be in 'constant prayer' for her recovery.

His attorneys Randy Kessler and Joe Habachy released a statement which said: 'In response to reports that Nick Gordon is taking legal action, he would like it to be clear, he is not.

Ms Brown, 21, has been in a coma at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta since January 31, when she was found face down in a bathtub

Lost control of car: Bobbi Kristina Brown was driving a Jeep Liberty on January 27 when she lost control, crossed into oncoming traffic and collided with another vehicle. She was found unresponsive on January 31. The 21-year-old is seen here in an undated selfie

'Mr Gordon's only concern is the recovery of Bobbi Kristina

'He remains in constant prayer for his companion and he hopes to be reunited with her soon. Despite the incredible public interest, we ask and hope that this request can be resolved privately by Mr. Gordon and the family.'

Gordon reportedly made an attempt to visit his girlfriend after she had been first hospitalized, but instead he got into a physical confrontation with her relatives.

Last year, Bobbi Kristina's maternal aunt Marion Houston sought an order of protection against Gordon, accusing him of stalking her and sending her threatening messages, which reportedly included photos of guns. The restraining order expires in April.

Jered Brown said he had been helping Gordon, who was one of two people who found her in the bathtub, by acting as a liason between him and Bobbi's family.

'We sit down and talk about things he wants my family to know and what we would love for Krissy to know, and that is that he loves her and is just waiting for her to wake up,' he told the station 11Alive .

'To be honest with you, Nick is feeling very emotional right now behind all of this. He's pretty torn about about what's going on.'

He said Bobbi still needed ' a miracle' to survive and urged people to continue praying for her.

She had been troubled in the days before she was taken to hospital. Four days befoe she was driving and lost control of her silver Jeep Liberty, crashing into a gray Ford Taurus.

The driver of the Ford and a passenger in her Jeep were injured and transported to a hospital, according to a report from police at Roswell, Georgia.

Police had also been called to her home on January 23 after reports of a fight there, but officers found no evidence of an altercation, said Roswell police spokeswoman Lisa Holland.

Speaking out: Speaking to Fox News, Leolah Brown, Bobbi Kristina's aunt, has said she believes the young woman's boyfriend, Nick Gordon, should be charged in relation to her injuries

Whitney Houston was was found in a bathtub at a hotel near Los Angeles on February 11, 2012, hours before she was to attend a pre-Grammy Awards party.

The inquest ruled Houston's death was an accidental drowning, with heart disease and cocaine use listed as contributing factors.

Bobbi was her only child, although Gordon had been 'adopted' by the singer at the age of 12.

It is claimed Bobbi stands to inherit her mother's fortune of around $12 million when she reaches the age of 30.
