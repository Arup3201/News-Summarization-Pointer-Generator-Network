Arsenal have discussed the prospect of activating their buy-back option on Cesc Fabregas this summer as the midfielder prepares to leave Barcelona.

The Gunners have more urgent transfer business to address with the capture of a new right-back, defensive central midfielder and striker at the top of Arsene Wenger's shopping list.

But the idea of bringing Fabregas back to the Emirates Stadium is gathering pace behind-the-scenes at Arsenal, with the prospect of tabling an offer for the midfielder viewed as a realistic possibility.

In selling Fabregas to Barcelona, the
 north London club secured a first-option clause on their former captain
 - though that can only be triggered upon the Spain international 
informing the Catalan club that he wants to leave.

It is also understood that the clause is set at a fixed price of £25million.

Barca
 chiefs are open to selling Fabregas, but, despite the clause, are 
determined to reclaim as much of the £35million spent on the 27-year-old
 as possible.

Arsenal believe that if Fabregas returns to the Premier League this summer, the Emirates Stadium is his preferred destination.

Manchester
 United are not believed to be interested in signing Fabregas this 
summer, despite the club's failed attempts to land him last summer.

However, Manchester City and Chelsea are monitoring Fabregas' situation this summer as they plot their summer transfer business.

Fabregas qualifies as a homegrown player, a major attraction for both Manuel Pellegrini and Jose Mourinho.

But
 the fact Arsenal have first-option on Fabregas, and the midfielder's 
obvious links with the club, leaves them in pole position in the race to
 sign the Barca star.
