Children are not harmed in any way by losing in competitive sports, former Olympian Sir Roger Bannister has claimed.

Speaking at the Chipping Norton Literary Festival in Oxfordshire, the 85-year-old said young people need more competitive sports in schools, not less, adding that he felt 'terribly strongly' about the importance of physical education lessons.

The former athlete, who rose to fame after breaking the four minute mile barrier in 1954, described changes to the way sport was taught in schools as 'worrying'.

Legend: Sir Roger, who rose to fame after breaking the four minute mile barrier in 1954, described changes to the way sport was taught in schools as 'worrying'

Athlete: Roger Bannister as a young man was the first person to break the four minute mile in 1954. He believes competitiveness is a vital life skill and should be encouraged in schools

Sir Roger was quoted by The Telegraph as saying: 'Children like competing. They don't suffer an emotional crippling for life if they come second or third in the egg and spoon race.'Â

'In some schools PE can easily be got out of. It's not attractive because there's no competition. Or they have to get on a bus somewhere to get there because their playing fields have been sold off to fund a computer room,' he added.

Sir Roger's comments echo those made in his new autobiography, Twin Tracks, where he demands the Government avoid 'destructive neglect' caused by schools making daily exercise a low priority.

He also criticises the 'more liberal concepts' that took hold in the 1980s where failure became something as purely negative, and a competitive spirit as something that is 'bad for character'.

Last week a survey claimed that most children would be happy for competition to be removed from sport as they had lost interest in the concept of winning.

Research by Marylebone Cricket Club suggested that although pupils still believe it is 
important to experience winning and losing, 64 per cent admit they wouldn't 
miss sport's competitive element.

The survey prompted experts to voice concern that sports lessons were failing to foster competitive spirit in pupils, warning that Britian risked losing its competitive edge unless young people start caring about whether they win or lose.

The research also led to speculation that a 'prizes for all' culture still holds sway at many schools.
