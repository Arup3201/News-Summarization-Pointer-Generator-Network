A number of interested parties are said to be ready to launch a bid for the island, which at one time had more than 800 people living on it when it was used to produce 900 tonnes of dynamite each month during the Second World War.

TNT production ceased in 1972 and the old village and quarters were dismantled and removed seven years later.

The island was bought by communications billionaire Craig McCaw in 1994 for $19 million at the time to transform it into one of the world’s most luxurious resort developments.
