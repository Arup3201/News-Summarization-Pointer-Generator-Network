Stoke City forward Jonathan Walters has sent out a warning to any players thinking of spitting at him, saying that culprits will be 'eating through a straw'.

Manchester United's Jonny Evans and Papiss Cisse of Newcastle United were involved in an incident that saw both appear to spit at each other on Wednesday night, and were both charged by the FA on Thursday.

But if any other Barclays Premier League players are planning on spitting, they would be well advised to keep it away from Walters.

'As a player you take anything off the ball; pinches and kicks that are meant to wind you up,' Walters told talkSPORT. 'Little things like that go on in any match.

'But spitting is pretty low. If it happened to me and someone spat at my face or towards me then I think he'd be eating his supper through a straw that night.

'I wouldn't be that happy. It's the lowest of the low.'

Cisse apolgised for his actions and accepted his FA charge on Thursday, resulting in a seven-game ban - six for spitting and one extra after a violent conduct earlier in the season.Â 

Evans, meanwhile, denied he had spat at Cisse and has until 6pm on Friday to respond to the FA charge. If found guilty he will be banned for six games.
