A television crew recording a documentary about bailiffs were stunned to find £5million stashed in a wooden box hidden in a flat.

$8.5million, the equivalent of  about £5million, was found by the crew stuffed in a wooden box hidden in the apartment in Silvertown, east London.

The apartment is located in Wards Wharf - a collection of luxury new-builds in London's Docklands - and is close to London City Airport.

Stash: $8.5million - around £5million - was found hidden in a wooden box in an east London apartment. It was discovered by TV crews from Channel 5 who were making a documentary about bailiffs

The crew, believed to be filming a programme for a Channel 5 series, had followed the bailiffs to the property where they were executing a warrant to recover money in a separate issue.

Police were called and officers seized the cash. It has since been sent for authentication.

Police confirmed there is no suspicion of a terrorism connection.

A Metropolitan police spokesman said: 'Officers in Newham have recovered $8.5million at a residential flat.

Location: The money was found stashed in a flat in Wards Wharf - a collection of luxury newbuilds in London's Docklands located near to City Airport. A 29-year-old man was arrested and bailed until August, police said

'Police were called at approximately 10:25hrs on Wednesday, 11 June to an address in Wards Wharf Apartments, E16 after a large quantity of cash was found by bailiffs who were executing a warrant there.

'Detectives from Newham are investigating.'

They added that a 29-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of money laundering and has been released on bail to a date in mid-August.
