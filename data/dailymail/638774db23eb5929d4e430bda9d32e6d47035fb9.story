A New York lawyer who has admitted to brutally killing his girlfriend in 2012 will argue this week that he strangled the woman because he was traumatized as a child by his mother.

Jason Bohn, 35, has been charged with murder over the beating and strangling of 27-year-old Danielle Thomas in their Astoria, New York apartment June 25, 2012. 

The Columbia University-educated lawyer, whose trial got under way late last month, will rely on testimony of Los Angeles-based forensic psychiatrist Alexander Sasha Bardey, who is known in Hollywood circles as a consultant on the TV drama 'Law and Order: Special Victims Unit.' 

Courtroom strategy: The defense will claim that Jason Bohn (left), who has been charged with strangling his girlfriend Danielle Thomas (right), was traumatized as a child and 'blew up' during his confrontation with the victim

The expert will attempt to convince a 
Queens jury that Bohn was suffering from 'Intermittent Explosive 
Disorder' and did not know what he was doing when he stomped on and 
throttled Thomas, an analyst at Weight Watchers.

The
 prominent psychiatrist will also cast some of the blame on Bohn's 
mother, Maureen O'Connell, chief financial officer at Scholastic, New York Post reported.

Blame game: A psychiatrist will testify for the defense that Bohn suffered from trauma because he was abandoned as a child by her career-minded mother, Scholastic Chief Financial Officer Maureen O'Connell

Bardey
 is expected to make the case that Miss O'Connell abandoned 
her son when he was 10 years old to focus on her career in the 
publishing business. 

O'Connell,
 who according to her corporate profile in Bloomberg BusinessWeek draws 
annual compensation in the amount of $1.2million, has been footing her 
son's mounting legal bills.

Mr
 Bardey co-produced Steven Soderbergh’s highly acclaimed 2013 thriller 
'Side Effects' starring Rooney Mara as a young wife who kills her husband,
 portrayed by Channing Tatum, after taking a new anti-depression 
medicine.    

During 
opening statements January 29, prosecutors revealed that Danielle Thomas was 
afraid for the life of her dog, Schnoozer, and rushed home on the night 
of her murder to protect him, even though a friend had offered to take 
her to a hotel. 

Prosecutor 
Patrick O'Connor told the jury panel that Bohn had threatened to kill 
the black-and-white pooch in the past, and Thomas rushed home in a bid 
to save her pet.

‘It was for the love of her dog,’ the prosecutor said. ‘She was afraid for her dog.’

Bohn's
 defense attorney, Todd Greenberg regaled the jurors with his client's 
rags-to-riches tale, describing the 35-year-old as a victim of childhood
 trauma who was abandoned by his career-obsessed mother and 
drug-addicted father, but who managed to graduate from a top school after spending his teens living in a group home.

‘How
 did someone like him end up in a courtroom charged with murder in the 
first degree?’ Greenberg asked jurors. ‘The answer is mental illness.’

A
 message accidentally left on a friend's voicemail that allegedly 
captured the last terrifying moments of Thomas' life is expected to play a
 major role in the trial.

On the chilling recording, a man believed to be Bohn relentlessly questions why Miss Thomas made a phone call to a number with a 508 area code.

Bohn then strangles the 27-year-old before letting go as she pleads with him and tries to answer his questions, CBS was told by prosecutors.

She struggles to breath as she answers over and over: 'I don't know... Jason, I love you.'

He then replies: 'You have five seconds and then...and then I'm going to kill you.

He continues: 'I'm going to let you up and then you need to answer quickly or else you die... Danielle, why did you call that number?

'Danielle you are so stupid. You think I'm going to stop, I won't stop.'

It is unclear whether the voicemail came from the victim or alleged killer's cellphone.

Neighbors called police to check on her after hearing a fight and the woman's dead body was found in a bathtub full of ice.

Bohn
 had fled the couple's apartment in Queens with his girlfriend's phone, 
which he used to assure her family she was fine.

He
 sent a text to one of her contacts saying: 'Please trust me,' adding 
that Thomas was 'fine' and attending the weekend’s gay pride parade in 
Greenwich Village.

He
 also used the phone to call a former flame, allegedly confessing to her
 that he got drunk and unwittingly slammed Miss Thomas against a wall.

'I’m in serious trouble,' Bohn told Jasmine Nieves in a recording played in court last month. 'Please do not talk with any law enforcement officials until my defense attorneys can contact you.

'I don’t remember anything that happened, OK. I think I pushed her. She bumped her head. When I woke up the next morning she was not breathing. I freaked out and I fled the city.'

Despite Bohn's pleadings, Nieves spoke to a detective who contacted her the following day and played the voicemail for him.

He
 was eventually tracked down to a restaurant in White Plains five days 
after the killing and charged with murder - which was later upgraded to 
first degree - and evidence tampering.

After he was jailed, Bohn dictated to his brother a self-pitying rant to be posted on Facebook blaming 
his girlfriend for the killing.

He blamed Thomas, stress, alcohol and his own abuse at the hands of his father for the murder - refusing to take responsibility for his murderous actions.

'I suspected she was a cheater,' he wrote.

'At the 
very least, I gradually confirmed she was a compulsive liar, 
particularly with regard to relations with the opposite sex, both past 
and present.

'As a result I grew insecure and 
abusive. In hines-sight [sic] one of us should've walked away. But, I was already 
madly in love with her.

'I was also extremely mad (both meanings).'

He described the night he killed her, claiming he got drunk and snapped but 'in all honesty, it was an accident,' he wrote.

'I woke up the next morning in complete shock.

'My knuckles were bruised badly and she was on the floor unconscious,' he added on his Facebook page.

Police records show that Bohn has a 
history of abuse and had repeatedly threatened Thomas before her 
death, saying he would hunt her down 'like a dog in the streets'.

When
 officers discovered Thomas, they found two handwritten notes in the 
couple’s apartment, believed to have been written by 
Bohn.

The first note 
said: ‘It was an accident…I had been drinking and I was drunk when I got
 home. She was already asleep. I woke up and there was fighting between 
us. When I woke up again she was unconscious…I am sorry.'

The second note, according to Queens District Attorney Richard Brown, read: ‘Dani, I will love you forever.’

In the Facebook post, he maintains he loves and misses her, and described his bleak existence.

'I 
alternate between crying uncontrollably in my cell while I stare at her office 
building from my window to fighting with other inmates over food,' he wrote.

In a further show of self pity, Bohn added he had struggled with abuse and abandonment.

He and his brother lived in a Florida trailer park with
 their father, who put beer in their bottles when they were babies, and 
turned Jason to cocaine, Chris Bohn, 30, told the Post.

Thomas was a senior analyst at Weight Watchers and had recently moved from Florida to New York to be with her boyfriend.

Neighbors recalled hearing her screams for help the evening she was killed.

'She’s screaming; she’s calling for help: "He’s kill me. Somebody help me,"' recalled the building's superintendent to CBS.

Other tenants said they heard the 
tumultuous and violent couple's brawls since they moved in. Thomas had even filed for an order of protection against Bohn.

In a criminal complaint obtained by 
the MailOnline last year, a police officer described numerous bruises on her face 
and back and threatening emails she suffered. She reported the 
assault on June 7, 2012 and Bohn called her while she 
was speaking with officers.

'It's war, I'll dedicate my life to 
hunting you down like a dog in the streets, I am going to make your life
 impossible,' he said, according to the report.

She went into hiding after getting 
her order of protection, staying at a battered women's shelter named 
Safe Horizon for two weeks.

It is unclear why she returned to the
 apartment, but she was found bludgeoned after a friend called 
investigators asking for them to check on her.

An autopsy report by the medical examiner revealed that Ms Thomas died of neck compression and blunt-force trauma.
