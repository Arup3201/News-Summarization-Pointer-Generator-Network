The husband of a slain pregnant Craigslist prostitute has been charged with her murder and the murder of their unborn child.

Justin Adams, 25, from Oklahoma, was charged with two counts of first-degree murder on Monday after the body of his wife Jaymie Adams was found beaten and stabbed to death on January 7.

In court documents, police say Justin Adams admitted lying about 
circumstances surrounding her disappearance in December.

Charged: Justin Adams, 25, has been charged for double-murder after his wife, carrying their unborn child, was murdered. He has been placed on suicide watch

Police say he 
initially told them she was meeting a friend, then said his wife worked 
as an Internet prostitute and left to meet a client.

Officers also say Justin Adams didn't reveal that his wife had accused him of domestic violence.

His attorney, Irven Box, told KWTV he didn't see anything in the affidavit that tied his client to the killing.

The mother-of-three was said to have 
advertised her sexual services on Craigslist and had gone to meet a 
client the night she disappeared, her husband told police.

Killed: Jaymie Adams had advertised
as a 'massage therapist' on Craigslist

A motorcyclist found her body along a
dirt track on January 7, although authorities believe it was just there
for a day before it was discovered.

The
cars of Adams and his mother, Tina Clark, were later seized by police, 
who said they were looking for evidence in the vehicles.

He
admitted he and his wife, who had been married since last February, were 
'swingers' and that she advertised on Craigslist as a 'massage 
therapist'.

Adam's arrest came after authorities evidence from interviews, phone records, the internet and email accounts that were inconsistent with Adams' story.

Oklahoma law states a suspect can be charged with two murders
if the victim is pregnant.

Investigation: The body of Jaymie Adams was found on a dirt 
bike track weeks after she went missing, and police believe it may have been there for a day

Suspicious: Jaymie Adams, 25, told her husband of one year she was going to meet a 'friend' at this McDonalds, where police later found her van

Secretive: Adams later revealed his wife had gone to meet a client at a motel

Following her disappearance, Adams made an emotional TV appeal, urging the public to help bring his wife home safely.

He said: 'She deserves to be at home with her family, our children need their mother.

'My wife is a loving a strong woman. She's an amazing mom, and amazing wife. We have three sons and she's two-months pregnant this week.

'I'm begging that if anyone has any information about my wife or her whereabouts, call police.'
