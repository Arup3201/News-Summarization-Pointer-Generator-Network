A travellers' site built in an 'unsuitable' location has reopened after a £1million taxpayer-funded refurbishment was needed because  it was 'trashed'.

The Timberlands site, in Pepperstock, just south of Luton, Bedfordshire, closed in 2012 after it fell into such disrepair children living there were forced to walk through sewage.

Almost three years after it was shut down it has reopened with six new pitches costing more than £150,000 each.

The new permanent homes - which all have solar-powered buildings and CCTV - already have new families inside, who say they are thrilled to be there.

Revamp: This travellers' site near Luton has been rebuilt in a £1million taxpayer-funded project after it was 'trashed'

One local resident, who asked not to be named, said: 'It's been closed for months while travellers had nowhere to go and now we find out almost £1million has been spent doing it up. 

'It looks very nice but it's a lot of money considering it just got trashed last time.' 

The local council said the site, which reopened on Monday, already has residents and they expect all six homes to be fully occupied soon.

They have spent £931,000 on the revamp, with pictures of the site in 2012 showing how the site had been destroyed and abandoned.

Three years ago the doors had been ripped off, the buildings were in serious disrepair and the site itself was overgrown.

Today, resident Karen Witney - a mother of three - said: 'The properties are absolutely brilliant and lovely and clean.'

Karen moved recently from Leicestershire and now rents one of the bungalows, which stand on a site which is warden controlled and with a secured gated entrance.

She said 'The homes are more for gypsy families and they have a living area, a kitchen and a bathroom with a shower. All the fittings are UVPC and there's even a solar panel in the roof. It's brilliant'. 

Rosy Penman, a local villager, said 'I really hope they are nice people. In the past, there were problems with the children living on the site.' 

Fresh start: Families are already moving into the site, which has six permanent properties

On the last occasion the site was given a refurb, pipes and fittings were ripped out of a washroom within weeks. Litter was dumped in fields around the site and bottles thrown at horses. 

Despite the new improvements local councillor Richard Stay criticised the cost and location of the development.

He said: 'When it closed in 2012 it was a scandal, there were children walking around in open sewage'.

'It had to be closed. But it's in an unsuitable place, given that there are elderly and disabled people who live nearby.

'We received a grant from the government for use on travellers' sites but it was specific to this location, despite there being far more suitable locations.'

A spokesman for Central Bedfordshire Council said: 'The site opened last week to allow people to begin moving on ahead of the tenancy start date (on Monday). Six households will be in occupation with most having already moved in successfully last week'.
