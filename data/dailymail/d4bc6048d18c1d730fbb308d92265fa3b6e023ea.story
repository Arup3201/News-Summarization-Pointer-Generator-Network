In an apparent bid to redeem itself after recent controversy, Abercrombie & Fitch has launched its very first collection featuring the color black.

The new items include a chic black leather jacket for $140, cuffed shorts for $35 and a $35 black-and-white floral skirt that falls to knee-length.

The retailer's former ban on black was reportedly enforced by CEO Mike Jeffries, who even went so far as to tell employees they were not allowed to wear the color either, calling it too 'formal'.

The company said in a statement in 2013: 'Abercrombie & Fitch does not sell black clothing and discourages wearing it at our home office and in our stores, because we are a casual lifestyle brand and feel black clothing is formal.

'We have nothing against black clothing and feel it is perfectly appropriate for things like tuxedos.'

The move seems to indicate that the company is trying to appeal to more customers, after earning something of a reputation for being elitist.

Aside from banning black, Abercrombie is also known for not selling women's size XL or XXL, unlike most of its competitors including H&M and American Eagle.

In a 2006 interview with Salon, Mr Jeffries explained why the retailer caters to a very specific type of customer.

'Abercrombie's customer is changing, and we're ready to change with her and him'

'In every school there are the cool and popular kids, and then there are the not-so-cool kids,' he explained at the time.

'Candidly, we go after the cool kids. We go after the attractive all-American kid with a great attitude and a lot of friends. A lot of people don't belong [in our clothes], and they can't belong. Are we exclusionary? Absolutely.'

Abercrombie's venture into black apparel is the latest in a series of changes to alter its image.

Transformation: Abercrombie's venture into black apparel is the latest in a series of changes to alter its image, including easing up on the perfume sprayed in stores and removing shutters that made the stores darker

In May, it was announced that the company would ease up on the fragrance that is sprayed throughout the stores.

Another part of the overhaul saw the retailer get rid of the heavy, daylight-obscuring shutters on the windows in 240 stores around the U.S. Even the logos are being toned down and made less prominent.

'[Abercrombie] is targeted to its customer, its customer is changing, and we're ready to change with her and him,' Mr Jeffries told Businessweek in May.
