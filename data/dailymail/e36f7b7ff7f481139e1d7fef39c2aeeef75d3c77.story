David Cameron is set to pack the House of Lords with more cronies and failed politicians despite warnings the number of peers is set to top 1,000.

Constitutional experts have warned that handing dozens of political allies and donors is ‘unsustainable’, but Government sources said another list of appointments to the bloated second chamber is due within the next fortnight.

Nick Clegg and Ed Miliband will also get the chance to send more peers to the Lords despite criticism of places in the legislature for donors who have handed over millions of pounds in donations.

Packed full of peers: David Cameron is set to pack the House of Lords with more cronies and failed politicians despite warnings that the number of peers with the right to sit in the chamber is set to top 1,000

The list of around 20 new peers is expected to contain at least one Conservative Party donor and around three Labour nominees.

Former energy minister Greg Barker, an old ally of the Prime Minister, is among those tipped to enter the Lords – though not until the time of the next general election.

Mr Barker, one of the first MPs to back Mr Cameron for the Tory leadership and a dogged campaigner against climate change, surprised colleagues by giving up his job voluntarily in last week’s Government reshuffle and announcing he is to stand down as an MP in nine months’ time.

David Willetts, the former universities and science minister, is thought to be another leading candidate to be handed a peerage when he too steps down at the next election.

Mr Cameron is also said to have been lining up long-serving Tory home affairs adviser Patrick Rock to enter the Lords before he resigned after being arrested over alleged child porn offences. Mr Rock has now been charged.

All three parties have called for a smaller upper house, given that it is now larger than the entire European Parliament. In the world, only China has a larger legislative chamber in the form of the National People’s Congress.

Last summer, the three main parties appointed 30 more peers to the Lords, taking its membership to 836 – 200 more than the House of Commons. The extra peers are costing taxpayers an estimated further £1.2 million a year.

Peers themselves complain the chamber is intolerably overcrowded, with members competing for seats in the chamber and office space outside.

They complain of a fractious atmosphere and warn that a rapid influx of new peers – particularly former MPs – has had a negative impact on the Lords' traditionally non-partisan ethos and courteous atmosphere.

However, Government sources say the Prime Minister will unveil a further list of appointments as part of a coalition deal to drastically alter the make-up of the upper chamber.

Tories and the Lib Dems said on coming to power in 2010 that the chamber was unfairly dominated by hundreds of Labour peers.

None can be removed unless they die, so the Government says it needs to appoint scores of its own to shift the balance of power and help ensure the fair passage of legislation through Parliament.

The last effort to reform the Lords, which would eventually have seen 80 per cent of peers elected and the numbers cut to 450, foundered in 2012 after a rebellion by backbench Conservatives and the refusal of Labour MPs to cooperate.

Government sources they will not take lectures from Labour, which they say stuffed the Lords with ‘duds and retreads’ during its 13 years in power.

Lib Dem leader Mr Clegg has continued to make appointments to the Lords despite arguing the entire chamber should be abolished and replaced with an elected House.

Senior Tories concede that their party’s backbench rebellion against proposals to introduce a few dozen elected peers as a first step towards reform looks more and more foolish, since it prompted the Lib Dems to block separate reforms to Commons constituency boundaries and cut the number of MPs by 50 in 2015.

That means the Tories will fight next year’s election on boundaries heavily biased against them, meaning they need a poll lead of seven or eight points to be confident of a Commons majority.

It comes after Tories and Lib Dems complained it was dominated by Labour

Peers cannot be removed until they die so to get parity they must add more
