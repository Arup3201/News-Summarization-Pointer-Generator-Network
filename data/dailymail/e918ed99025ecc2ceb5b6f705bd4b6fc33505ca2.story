British engineers are leading pioneering research to see if train carriages can be 'bomb-proofed' to reduce the carnage caused by terrorist attacks such as the 7/7 bombings.

The European project was set up to examine ways to make tube systems more resistant to the kinds of bomb blasts which caused devastation in London and Madrid.

After three years of research, experts at the SecureMetro can now offer the rail industry advice on how to better protect passengers.

Researchers used high-speed cameras to film a controlled explosion in a prototype rail carriage

The research has allowed experts to analyse the explosions and how they damage train carriages in detail

Fifty-two people lost their lives and almost 800 were injured in the 7/7 London bombings in 2005 and 191 died and 1,800 were wounded in Madrid the year before.

Conor O'Neill, from Newcastle University's School of Mechanical and Systems Engineering, is leading the EU-funded project which aims to make sure that if any such atrocities are to occur in the future, their impact is minimised.

The research has involved looking at the evidence from previous attacks and carrying out controlled explosions on a decommissioned Tube carriage.

High speed cameras were used to slow 
down the blast, allowing its impact on the vehicle's structure and 
interior to be analysed in detail.

A similar test was later carried out on a
prototype carriage specially built to reduce the devastating damage 
caused by a bomb detonating inside it.

Their
findings have pointed to a number of measures which they believe rail 
companies could introduce immediately to reduce the damage caused by 
bomb blasts and flying debris.

Project leader Conor O'Neil believes tethering panels such as these could prevent dangerous shrapnel from injuring those further from a blast

Part of the aim of the research is to reduce casualties caused by debris - but not just in the initial blast.

Following the inquests into the 
deaths of the London 7/7 bombings, it was revealed that medical emergency teams were hindered by debris strewn across train carriages.

And, had the Tube bombers detonated 
their explosives while the trains were at the platform, rather than 
while travelling through tunnels, the death toll would have been much 
higher, as debris flew outwards like shrapnel.

It is this that prompted research 
into energy-absorbing materials being fitted, as well as plastic coating
for windows, preventing metal or glass debris from shattering outwards.

Tethering down heavy components such as ceiling panels would also reduce the amount of obstacles between rescue teams and the wounded.

Conor O'Neill said: 'Preventing flying objects is the key.

'Tethering ceiling panels reduced the risk of fatalities and injury from flying shrapnel and also meant the gangways were kept relatively clear of debris, allowing emergency staff quick access to the injured.

'The window coating we developed was also incredibly effective. Without it the windows are blown outwards - putting anyone outside, such as those standing on a platform, at risk from flying glass.

'With the plastic coating you see a clear rippling effect as the blast moves through the train but every window remains intact apart from the safety windows which are designed to be easily knocked out.'

The engineers also investigated dividing carriages with materials that soak up energy and reduce the impact of a blast wave - though in the case of the 7/7 bombing, the deceased were all travelling in the same carriage as one of the bombers.

'The Madrid bombings in 2004 and the 7/7 attack in London the year after highlighted how vulnerable our trains are to attack - particularly busy metro and commuter trains,' said Mr O'Neill.

'At the same time we have to be realistic. Completely replacing existing vehicles just isn't an option. Instead, we have developed and incorporated new technology and materials into existing carriages to improve performance.

'What we've shown is that companies could make some relatively cost-effective and simple modifications that would significantly improve the outcome of an attack.'

The team is now in a position to advise rail industry chiefs on the best design approach, he said.

He added: 'A bomb on a train is always going to be devastating but what we are trying to do is find a way in which the vehicle itself can help to mitigate the impact of an attack.

'These are all low-cost, simple solutions that can be put on existing trains which could not only save lives but also reduce the attractiveness of our railways for potential terrorist attacks.'
