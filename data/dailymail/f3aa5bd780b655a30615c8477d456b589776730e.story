The former ACT chief minister has revealed a long-term, exhausting battle with anorexia, which saw her weight dwindle to a mere 30 kilograms.

The 59-year-old has announced her teenage struggles at a function on Monday and has shared that she still has to have little discussions with herself about body image and naturally thinks she is too fat.

Now the head of the Australian Chamber of Commerce, Ms. Carnell has recalled beginning to lose weight at 12 or 13 years old when a teenage interest in boys and fashion sparked.

She said she felt rotten about herself and what she was doing to others in her life.

'I was stick thin but people said 'wow you are looking so great.' I wasn't - I was looking really skinny,' she told ABC television.

'It is hard to understand why you can't put a piece of food in your mouth, chew it up and swallow it. How hard can that be. When you've got anorexia it's like moving a mountain,' she said.

The ABC reported that Ms Carnell was in and out of hospitals in her home town of Brisbane during the 1960s and 70s and was lying to her parents about what she was eating and the amount of exercise she was doing.

When 15-years-old, she was sent to an adolescent psychiatric facility at Prince Henry Hospital in Sydney when the situation became severe.

'For a 15-year-old away from home it was to say the least pretty scary,' she said.

She said her parents were only allowed to visit occasionally and she was incredibly homesick.

'Imagine a scenario when you've got a teenage daughter who's always been a bit of an overachiever, pretty smart — and all of a sudden they're killing themselves in front of your eyes,' she said.

Ms. Carnell outlined these experiences at a function where the advocacy group The Butterfly Foundation released a report that outlined the high cost of treating eating disorders that affected almost a million Australians.

The chairman of the Butterfly Foundation, David Murray said their report from Deloitte focuses on the economic cost of the problem and the large benefits of intervention.

'Early intervention pays big time, with about a 50 per cent cost reduction for the government in the health system by getting the problem early enough,' he said. 

'We have to adjust the system for early intervention which very quickly recognises this as a mental condition and brings in the right type of specialist support.'
