A 1920s Spanish castle that spends six months of the year surrounded by water and is only accessible by boat has gone on the market for £2.7million.

For the same price as a four-bedroom townhouse at the redeveloped Battersea Power Station in central London, a new owner could snap up the picture postcard castle, which has a 150-seat banquet hall, located in the Valle Iruelas Nature Reserve in Burguillo, in the Spanish province of Avila.

Included in the £2.7 million asking price is 10,000 square metres of land that forms the rest of the island, and a private jetty so that the new owner can come and go by boat.

Located an hour from the Spanish capital Madrid, it has numerous terraces to ensure you can always find a place in the sun, the huge banqueting hall as well as a fully equipped gym.

From the battlements it is possible to see the local wildlife such as the black vulture that makes its home in the surrounding forests.

The castle has all the amenities of a modern house including solar power to provide electricity, full central heating, air conditioning and huge fireplaces.

Until recently it was used as a hotel offering suites and double rooms for up to 34 people, with a golf course just nine miles away and many good local gourmet hot spots featuring local cuisine.
