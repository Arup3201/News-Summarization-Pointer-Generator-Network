Two daredevil climbers who've dedicated their lives to scaling some of the world's tallest and most iconic buildings without safety harnesses have revealed their latest exploits and shared what drives them and their biggest fears to MailOnline.

Vitaliy Raskalov, 22, and Vadim Makhorov, 25, climbed to death-defying and dizzying heights to take these vertigo-inducing pictures from the tips of skyscrapers looking down on Hong Kong and nearby Shenzhen last month.

Having eluded an official ban from China following their last trip when they filmed themselves scaling the 2,132ft (650 metre)-high, under-construction Shanghai Tower, the world-famous pair returned lured back by the dramatic skylines.

Raskalov told MailOnline: 'I'd rather die falling from a great height than fall from a building four stories high and end up alive and crippled. That's the biggest fear'.

Don't look down! Vitaliy Raskalov, 22, and Vadim Makhorov, 25, have shown off their latest free climbing exploits with pictures from a return trip to China following an attempted travel ban by the authorities. Seen here on the Ibis Hotel, Hong Kong

Rush: The team have climbed some of the world's tallest and most iconic buildings, documenting their conquests as they go. Seen here at the summit of one of two spirals at the top of the 1,259ft (384-metre)-tall Shun Hing Square in Shenzhen

Subterfuge: The pair often elude security to gain access to the roofs of buildings which they climb without harnesses to take their stomach-churning pictures like this shot from a spiral on the Shun Hing Square in Shenzhen

The adrenalin-junkies from Ukraine and Russia, who both use pseudonyms, met in St Petersburg when they bumped into each other while climbing a suspension bridge.

The duo have since taken to the rooftops of Barcelona's Sagrada Familia, Cologne's Cathedral, and the Eiffel Tower and Notre Dame in Paris. They have also conquered Giza's pyramids and some of Dubai's newest skyscrapers.

Last February the pair made headlines by scaling the 2,132ft (650 metre)-high, under-construction Shanghai Tower in China, filming a jaw-dropping video of the climb. And when the video went live, the Chinese authorities said the climbers would be banned from ever returning to the country.

But their pseudonyms allowed them to slip through the net and for this latest China trip the pair went to the Southeastern city of Shenzhen last month and climbed the 2,165ft (660-metre)-high, 110-story Ping An Finance Centre, which is still under construction.

'We went upstairs disguised as local workers,' Mr Raskalov told MailOnline. 'We got 610 metres [2,001ft] high then security guards stopped us. At first they were very angry and only spoke in Chinese so we couldn't really talk. But they recognised us and managed to say, "You've been on Shanghai Tower!" They must have seen our previous video.'

Exploits: The duo, who use pseudonyms to avoid identification and travel bans, can now add the iconic Bank of China building in Hong Kong as one of their many conquests around the world

Gulp: They often dress in suits and ties disguised as workers to gain access to the top floors before scaling the outsides of tower blocks

Dizzying: Photos taken from the top of skyscrapers looking down on the streets below are posted on Instagram to more than 150,000 followers

Breathtaking: These dazzling pictures were taken from Mong Kok in Hong Kong. The area holds the world record for the highest population density, with 340,000 people per square mile

Mr Raskalov added: 'Soon after that we started laughing with them and managed strike up a chat about girls and other stuff and they must have thought, "These are some cool guys". Eventually they let us leave and didn't even try to check our passports.'

The pair also got stunning pictures from the 1,259ft (384-metre)-high Shun Hing Square building, Shenzhen's second tallest skyscraper. They then headed to Hong Kong - Mr Raskalov's favourite climbing destination.

'We got into the Bank of China Tower but we were unsuccessful in getting on the roof,' he said. Standing 1,204ft (367 metres) tall and boasting 72 floors, the tower is one of the most recognisable skyscrapers in Hong Kong.

'We went there dressed in suits and ties and asked for a pass for the 56th floor from reception,' said Mr Raskalov. 'They saw we were well-dressed and just gave us the passes. But there were security guards on the roof so we couldn't make it all the way up.'

On their first trip to China last year they slept 2,132ft (650 metres) up on Shanghai Tower for 12 hours waiting for pollution to clear but had no problems with security. 'When I woke up on the tower I felt like I was in an aeroplane, behind the clouds,' Mr Raskalov said. 'And we didn't have one problem with security. It was the Chinese New Year holiday so there was almost nobody there.'

After the Shanghai Tower video went live the Chinese government slapped a ban on the climbers which they evaded easily. 'They said they tried to report us to the Russian government but I think it was just something to tell the newspapers,' Mr Raskalov said. 'I don't think they really did it. When we came in again through customs the other week we had no problems at all. We weren't even nervous.'

Look, one hand! Vitaliy and Vadim's conquests have seen them climb to almost 2, 300ft (701 metres) on top of some of the world's highest buildings

Mr Raskalov claims that he has never been close to falling or feared for his life during a climb and has no qualms about continuing to travel the world in search of new skyscraper thrills. In fact, he says that the higher up he climbs, the less fear he feels.

'I'd rather die falling from a great height than fall from a building four stories high and end up alive and crippled. That's the biggest fear,' he said.

'Every day in Moscow, maybe six times a day, I feel like I'm going to die when I'm driving around on my motorcycle. People are crazy there. Driving in Moscow is far more dangerous than climbing a skyscraper.'  

Mr Raskalov is now taking a break from skyscraper climbing in Thailand, before heading to Germany to prepare for an exhibition of On The Roofs photography at Munich's Colab Gallery. This summer the pair hope to travel to South America for more high-octane climbs and to compile a documentary about themselves and other urban explorers around the world.

Oh la la! Mr Raskalov gets a view of the Eiffel Tower that few tourists in Paris get from a nearby rooftop. The pair try to capture every thrill-seeking moment on camera

In their time climbing buildings around the world they have got into numerous scrapes with local authorities and private security. Mr Raskalov said: 'The worst one I had was in Chicago. Police caught us and wanted to put us in jail for six months for trespassing. We didn’t go on the roof top, we just went on the highest stairs.

'The police caught us and after that told us the car was coming to take us to jail, where we’d be for maybe three  or six months. And they said "You will pay a very big penalty". But security helped us – they said we were nice people and maybe we could make a deal. Then the police just gave us a penalty of $25.'

He added: 'Maybe we’re very lucky. I know a lot of cases where people climb on bridges or roof tops and end up in jail - especially people who climb on construction buildings in New York. Even if security or police don't catch them on a construction building or bridge, after they post in Instagram or Facebook they track them down. They come round your house in a few months and put you in jail. New York is the most strict place in the world for any exploration. That’s why we haven't done it yet.'
