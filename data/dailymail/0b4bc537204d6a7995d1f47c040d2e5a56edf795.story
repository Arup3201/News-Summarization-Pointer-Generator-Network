While most onlookers may be distracted by Vanessa Hudgens' flawless physique, golden tan and risque shorts as she practises Pilates, it seems that her bizarre footwear has not been overlooked.

The High School Musical star donned some interesting purple striped toe socks at her exercise class in L.A., California.

But the 24-year-old wasn't making a fashion statement or simply donning her slipper socks to the gym, ToeSox (as they are officially named) are actually designed especially for Yoga or Pilates.

Quirky footwear: Vanessa Hudgens was sporting some seriously strange footwear at her Pilates class

And whether she intended to or not, Vanessa is now leading a hot new footwear trend as they sold out on Amazon early today before stocks were replenished.

The Â£9.50 socks are made with a five-toe design 
to promote toe separation resulting in greater flexibility and strength, according to retailers.

Luckily for Vanessa, who was pulling some serious shapes during her class, the non-slip sole allows you to contort your body into all sorts of positions without the danger of slipping over.

Not as weird as they look: The socks, known as ToeSox, are actually specially designed for Yoga and Pilates to help boost circulation and prevent slips. Earlier today they were sold out on Amazon, right

'Worry no more about dirty mats and sweaty residue, ToeSox are the best 
hygienic alternative to bare feet.

'Made with cool and comfortable 
organic cotton, ToeSox slip right into your suitcase so there is no need
to travel with a mat. Join the Foot Revolution,' states one supplier's website.

ToeSox also have sandals and sports socks in their range - all with five toe 'pockets'.

The manufacturers say separating the toes 'is the best thing you can do for your feet' because it will 'encourage you to spread your toes which helps strengthen foot muscles and increase blood circulation.'

'Stronger feet improve posture, agility and balance,' they add.

Ready to go: As a Pilates regular Vanessa quickly prepared her reformer device and was ready to start toning

Whether or not it was thanks to her choice of footwear, Vanessa's hard worked paid off as she showed off 
her toned, cellulite-free legs in tiny purple tie-dyed booty shorts
for her gym class.

The star has previously spoken about her need to do Pilates thanks to a chocolate addiction.

She told Self magazine she hits the gym at least four times a week, combining cardio on machines with spin classes. But she said the 'secret to flat abs' is Pilates.

Fitness fanatic: Vanessa is regularly pictured hitting the gym

The actress is certainly very 
dedicated to her working out regime as she went to the class just hours 
before she had to get ready for the L.A. premiere of her new 
movie, Spring Breakers, on Thursday night.

In the film, she joins Selena Gomez and Ashley Benson to play friends who commit a robbery to fund their Spring Break.
