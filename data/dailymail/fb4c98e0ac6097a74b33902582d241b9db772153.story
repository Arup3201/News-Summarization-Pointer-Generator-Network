A passenger who tried to bring a loaded gun onto a plane in Chicago said he simply forgot he was packing heat.

Matthew W. Bysina was stopped by security and arrested on Friday at Chicago's Midway International Airport when they spotted a .38 caliber revolver, loaded with four live rounds, in the man's bag.

Transportation Security Administration (TSA) agents noticed the gun's outline when Bysina's bag went through the X-ray machine.

Oops: Illinois resident Matthew W. Bysina, 23, said he simply forgot he had a loaded revolver in his carry-on bag, when he tried to board a plane to Houston

The 23-year-old man told TSA agents that he forgot the gun was in his bag, according to the Chicago Tribune.

Bysina, a resident of Manhattan, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago, was arrested and charged with one felony count of boarding an aircraft with a weapon.

No injuries were reported.

Bysina was on his way to Houston, Texas when the piece was discovered in his carry-on luggage.

The Lone Star State is considered to have some of the most lenient gun laws in the U.S.

In early August, three people were killed, including one police officer, in a shooting near Texas A&M University, in College Station, 100 miles northwest of Houston.

John Pistole, head of the TSA, testified in Congress last year that TSA agents find an average of four to five firearms daily in carry-on bags at airports across the U.S. -- totaling 1,306 in 2011.

Pistole said 'very few [passengers] have malicious intent,' when he spoke at the National Press Club in March about the findings.

'Ten years after the events of 9/11, people are still trying to bring deadly weapons and other items onto aircraft,' he said.
