A Porsche owner was left facing a £15,000 repair bill after she lent her beloved car to her friend who filled it up with the wrong fuel.

Businessman Alan Thompson, 64, wanted to thank friend Elizabeth Moulton, 66, by returning her Cayenne 4x4 with a full tank after borrowing it for the weekend - but he pumped petrol into the luxury off-roader unaware it actually ran on diesel.

Mrs Moulton
 immediately noticed the £50,000 Cayenne had a problem and drove the spluttering
 car to her local Porsche dealership - with Mr Thompson offering to pay 
for the damage.

But
 they were left angry when the dealership quoted her £14,600 to fix the car, 
before another garage eventually solved the problem for just 
£1,000.

Alan Thompson and Liz Moulton were left angry when they were given a £15,000 repair bill after Mr Thompson accidentally put the wrong fuel in her Porsche Cayenne

Mr Thompson said: 'I wanted to take it back with a full tank. She drove off and I had no idea there was a problem.

'It is a common and very easy mistake to make when especially when you get to my age, when one frequently makes mistakes.

'We all make mistakes but I do object to being ripped-off to such a ludicrous extent by Porsche who I have found to be unsympathetic, inefficient and unhelpful.'

The dealership Mrs Moulton originally took the car to in Stratford, East London, said the Porsche needed new fuel pumps, fuel lines, a fuel distributor, pressure regulator and sensor, six high pressure injectors, a fuel hose and even a replacement fuel tank - quoting her £14,60 for the work.

Mr Thompson then got quotes from other official Porsche dealers and found their prices ranging from £5,000 to £10,000.

But he eventually found a garage who would solve the problem it for £1,000 - and Mr Thompson has accused Porsche of trying to rip him off.

Mrs Moulton has forgiven her friend the blunder, but is angry at Porsche for trying to charge her nearly £15,000 to solve a problem which eventually cost £1,000 to fix

Mr Thompson, who drives a Mercedes, says a local Mercedes dealer told him they charge £450 when it happens to their cars.

The garage he ended up using carried out the work for just over £1,000 - with the 4x4 not needing any of the new parts Porsche had listed.

They removed the fuel, fitted a new fuel filter, filled it with a fuel flush detergent to clean out the remainder of the contaminated fuel and then filled it with the diesel.

They charged him £1,103 for parts, labour and VAT and the Cayenne is now running as it was before the mix-up.

Mr 
Thompson said: 'I'm happy as I'm over £12,000 better off than if Liz had
 had Porsche Stratford carry out the work as per their estimate of 
£13,169.24.

'Porsche should invest another £20 on fitting a fail-safe device to their new vehicles as BMW, Ford and Land Rover do.

The fuel cap cover is clearly labelled with the correct type of fuel, but Mr Thompson say Porsche should fit the cars with a device that prevents users filling up with the wrong kind

Mr Thompson is not alone in making the mistake, over 120,000 motorists fill up their car with the wrong fuel each year, prompting some manufacturers to fit safeguards

'I am pretty sure that every potential buyer of a new Porsche diesel will be delighted to pay £100 for what I would regard as a must have option.'

Mr Thompson, from Hadley Wood, North London, said Mrs Moulton was very understanding about his fuel blunder.

Mrs Moulton said: 'I was dumbstruck when I was told the cost, I didn't know what to say or do. I couldn't be furious with Alan but I was furious with Porsche. I just thought "for goodness sake".

'Now the work has been carried out, the car is running brilliantly. I just think Porsche should be taken to task over this.'

Porsche have defended the original quote they gave, insisting other parts of the engine would have become damaged and would have needed replacing

But 
Porsche defended itself over the incident, saying the quote was 
'representative of the work that is recommended to be undertaken in this
 situation'.

A statement from the German manufacturer said: 'By not only filling the tank with petrol but also driving the vehicle with the wrong fuel, it is likely that the engine (in particular the fuel system) suffered considerable damage.

'As diesel fuel acts as both a lubricant and a fuel in a diesel engine, the contrasting solvent-effect of petrol could also have caused longer-term impact on the cylinders, valves, pistons etc. In short, it is highly damaging to the engine.'

Porsche added its diesel vehicles are fitted with warning labels on the fuel flap and surrounding area which highlight 'very clearly' the type of fuel the car requires.

Over 120,000 motorists fill their car with the wrong fuel each year and a number of manufacturers now having safeguards to prevent it from happening.
