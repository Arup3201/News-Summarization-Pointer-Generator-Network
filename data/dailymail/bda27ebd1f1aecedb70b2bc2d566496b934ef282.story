As a sexual harassment case threatens to derail Herman Cain's White House hopes, more details emerged last night about his alleged accuser and possible holes in his story.

In a debacle that the 2012 presidential hopeful claims is nothing but a 'witch hunt' to stifle his surging popularity, two possible cases against Mr Cain have popped up from his time as CEO of the National Restaurant Association.

Last night, The New York Times reported that one of the accusers was paid $35,000 - a year's salary - in a settlement as she departed following claims that the ex-Godfather's Pizza boss made her feel uncomfortable.

However, the number is way more than Mr Cain claimed she was paid in a Fox News interview Monday night.

Mr Cain told host Greta Van Susteren: 'We ended up settling for what would have been a termination settlement, maybe like three-months salary.'

In the same interview, he also inflated the woman's salary, saying he believed she made $40,000 - $50,000 a year.

The Times report comes as his unidentified accuser said she wishes to come forward to tell her side of the story.

A lawyer for one of the women who complained about Cain's behaviour told The Washington Post on Tuesday she wants to talk publicly about it.

According to that report, Joel P. Bennett, a Washington lawyer who specializes in employment cases, said he asked the National Restaurant Association to waive his client's confidentiality so she can respond to Cain's claims that the complaints were 'totally baseless and totally false.'

A spokeswoman for the restaurant association, Sue Hensley, said Tuesday night that the group had not been contacted by Bennett.

Bennett did not immediately return messages seeking comment from The Associated Press.

Mr Cain today claimed he never changed his story about bombshell sexual harassment allegations against him in the 1990s while he was the head of the National Restaurant Association.

This is despite the 65-year-old Republican presidential candidate giving a series of conflicting statements in the two days since the sensational accusations were disclosed by Politico.

Mr Cain had said he was unaware of a financial settlement given to a female employee over allegations he sexually harassed her - but later acknowledged he was aware of an ‘agreement’.

‘It was an agreement,’ Mr Cain told CNN. ‘So it looked like I had changed my story. I didn't change my story. The difference between settlement and agreement - it makes a difference to me.’

Meanwhile Mr Cain announced that his wife of 43 years, Gloria - who has not been seen with him on the campaign trail since he launched it in May - will soon take part in an exclusive interview.

‘You will meet my wife publicly, in an exclusive interview that we are currently planning and anticipating,’ Mr Cain told Fox News. ‘She will be introduced in terms of some limited exposure.

‘But it’s not her style for her to be with me on every campaign stop. My wife represents that calm and tranquillity that I look forward to seeing when I get home.’

Over the past two days, Mr Cain has admitted he knew of one agreement between the National Restaurant Association and a woman who accused him of sexual harassment.

He has said the woman initially asked for
a large financial settlement but ultimately received two to three 
months' pay as part of a separation agreement.

Mr Cain also acknowledged remembering one of the woman's accusations against him, saying he stepped close to her and told her she was the same height as his wife.

‘You will meet my wife publicly, in an exclusive interview that we are currently planning and anticipating. She will be introduced in terms of some limited exposure. But it’s not her style for her to be with me on every campaign stop. My wife represents that calm and tranquillity that I look forward to seeing when I get home'

He has said he is not aware of any other agreements or settlements with any other women, though Politico - which first disclosed the allegations on Sunday night - said there was another.

The political website reported that the trade group had given financial settlements to at least two female employees who accused the entrepreneur of inappropriate sexual behaviour.

But it’s not all bad for Mr Cain, as the media frenzy over the accusations helped the campaign enjoy one of its best fundraising days so far, his chief of staff Mark Block said.

Around $250,000 has poured in since the story broke on Sunday, reported the National Journal.

The Georgia businessman, who is near the top of national polls in the Republican presidential race, was in his second day of damage-control mode as he looked to blunt the fallout of the accusations.

They surfaced just two months before 
the leadoff Iowa presidential caucuses - and he spent Tuesday much like 
he did Monday, hopping from interview to interview to defend himself.

Mr Cain has repeatedly has denied that
he sexually harassed anyone, and has said he was falsely accused. He 
also has argued that the allegations are part of a ‘witch hunt.’

And he said ‘there's nothing else there to dig up’ - all but daring opposition researchers to dive into his lengthy business career.

The immediate political fallout was 
unclear, although the harassment allegations - and Mr Cain's response to
them - have the potential to reshuffle the GOP race.

Conservatives rallied around Mr Cain, likening the attacks to what they describe as the ‘high-tech lynching’ of another prominent black Republican - Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas.

They were referring back to Justice Thomas' divisive Supreme Court confirmation hearings two decades ago, where he was confronted with sexual harassment allegations from a one-time employee, Anita Hill.

The forceful early reaction to the latest firestorm - fuelled by racially charged rhetoric - suggests Mr Cain’s attempt to cast himself as a victim of the media and liberals could be paying dividends.

‘I think the left is totally and completely terrified of a conservative black man coming to power and prominence,’ said Debbie Dooley, a leader of Atlanta Tea Party Patriots.

‘They are trying to do the same thing to him that they did with Clarence Thomas.’

Pundit Ann Coulter fumed: ‘It's outrageous the way liberals treat a black conservative.’

‘This is about blacks and Hispanics 
getting uppity ... (Liberals) cannot have a black Republican running for
office, can't have a Hispanic. The Left owns those minorities, those two groups can't be seen rising on their own'

Radio show host Rush Limbaugh said: ‘This is about blacks and Hispanics getting uppity ... (Liberals) cannot have a black Republican running for office, can't have a Hispanic.

‘The Left owns those minorities, those two groups can't be seen rising on their own.’

But there is no evidence of liberal involvement in the disclosure of Mr Cain's allegations, and, in the fact, the revelations could end up benefiting his Republican opponents in the short term.

The accusations against Mr Cain, an untested newcomer on the political scene, could give more moderate GOP voters pause and could cause would-be donors to shy away.

Politico reported that at least two women who complained about sexually inappropriate behaviour while working for Mr Cain at the National Restaurant Association.

They had signed agreements with the restaurant group that gave them five-figure financial payouts to leave the association and barred them from discussing their departures, Politico claimed.

The report was based on anonymous sources and, in one case, what the publication said was a review of documentation that described the allegations and the resolution.

Politico said the politician’s spokesman J.D. Gordon told the publication that Mr Cain himself had indicated to campaign officials that he was ‘vaguely familiar’ with the charges.

Erin Matson, a vice president for the National Organization for Women, said the women in question should be given the benefit of the doubt.

‘It is deeply insulting that this is being called political,’ she said. ‘Sexual harassment allegations are always about a woman who is simply trying to go to work.’
