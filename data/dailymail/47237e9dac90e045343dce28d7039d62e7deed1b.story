A new permanent exhibition at the Natural History Museum will showcase some of its collection's most significant and valuable objects from 4.5billion years of our planet's past.

Visitors will be able to view specimens which inspired breakthroughs in the fields of botany, mineralogy, zoology and palaeontology, and delve deep into the backgrounds of the world’s most famous naturalists.

Charles Darwin, Hans Sloane, Alfred Russel Wallace and Richard Owen are among the celebrated characters that have populated the Museum with some of its 70million treasures.

Guy the Gorilla: Guy was a western lowland gorilla who lived at London Zoo from 1946 to 1978. He was one of the most popular animals in the zoo's history and millions of visitors fell in love with his gentle nature

Inspirational exhibits: This glass anatomical study, left, made by the Blaschka family between 1886 and 1889 using techniques which are now lost is one of 187 such models that will go on display at some point. Right, a Dodo skeleton constructed from bones that are around 1,000 years old

William Smith's ammonites: William Smith, known as the 'father of English geology', used 
these 200million-year-old fossils to prove that the rocks beneath our 
feet are layered through time launching the new science of geology, the 
study of Earth's structure

Left, an illustration from Audubon’s The Birds of America, which is the world’s most expensive book and one of the best-known natural history books ever produced. Right, A stuffed great auk - which became extinct shortly after 1852, following centuries of intense exploitation by people

On the Origin of Species, first edition: A rare copy of the book that changed the way we look at the world around us. Considered the most important book in biology, it describes Darwin¿s theory of evolution by natural selection

Charles Darwin's pigeons: These rock dove 
speciments provided him with the crucial evidence for the theory of 
evolution by natural selection. He bred them in his garden as an 
experiment and donated them to the Museum in 1867

Ancient: The Wold Cottage meteorite, left, the earliest surviving meteorite seen to land in the UK, which was formed during the birth of the solar system, 4.6billion years ago. Right, An adult female Neanderthal skull that was the first Neanderthal skull ever discovered and is about 50,000 years old

Each exhibit in the new gallery has its own story to tell and reveals a fascinating, and sometimes surprising, aspect of the Museum’s scientific or cultural heritage, a spokesman said.

Dr Michael Dixon, director of the museum, said: 'The opening of Treasures in the Cadogan Gallery represents an exciting future for the Natural History Museum.

'By inviting the world to explore the highlights of our world famous collection in this permanent gallery, many generations of visitors will capture their own unique insight into our natural world.'

Specimens include Guy the Gorilla, who was one of London Zoo's best loved animals during his time at the zoo from 1946 to 1978.

Overlooking Dippy, the museum's much-loved Diplodocus skeleton, the new exhibition is located on the upper mezzanine of the Central Hall and has been made possible thanks to a £2million donation from The Cadogan Charity.

It opens to the public on Friday, November 30.

Moa bone fragment: the first fragment of moa bone to be discovered, unearthed in the 1830s by Richard Owen, the first Superintendent of the Natural History Museum. It was the first evidence that the moa existed and will be displayed in Treasures alongside a full moa skeleton

Botanical breakthroughs: Left, George Clifford's herbarium sheet, which helped young Swedish scientist Carl Linnaeus to devise a structure for naming specimens. Right, Joseph Banks’s herbarium sheet, which consists of plants collected by the pioneering scientist on Captain Cook’s first voyage to Australia in 1770

Iguanodon teeth that are around 137 million years old: These teeth were discovered by Mary Ann Mantell in 1822. The first dinosaur teeth found, they provided evidence to support the theory that giant reptiles had once walked the Earth

Sacrifices for science: This Emperor penguin egg was one of only three fresh eggs collected during Captain Scott¿s ill-fated last expedition to the Antarctic in 1910. The expedition team hoped that the embryos inside would confirm the suspected link between reptiles and birds

Dwarf elephant tooth: This fossil tooth and jaw bone were discovered in Cyprus by palaeontologist Dorothea Bate. Between 10,000 and 800,000 years old, they were one of the first pieces of evidence to suggest that miniature elephants once lived in the island

From far and wide: Left, around 3.7billion years old, this ilmenite basalt fragment is the only piece of moon rock owned by the UK. Right, a 147million-year-old rock slab contains a fossil of an Archaeopteryx, the earliest known bird which combines both bird and dinosaur characteristics

Hans Sloane¿s nautilus shell: Beautifully carved, it is easy to imagine why this shell was one of Hans Sloane¿s favourite specimens. It was made in the seventeenth century and was part of Sloane¿s vast collection, which later formed the core of the British and Natural History museums

Alfred Russel Wallace¿s insects: A rare personal collection, assembled in Southeast Asia, 1854¿1862. Wallace, who is credited with the co-discovery of the theory of evolution by natural selection, kept very few of the specimens he collected

The skull of a north African Barbary lion thought to have lived in the Tower of London around 1280¿1385: This lion would have been the jewel of the King¿s menagerie and, after the ancient native lions, is the oldest lion to be found in the UK.
