Britain's most reckless drivers will be kept off the road while they pose a threat under plans for a new Government crackdown on dangerous motorists, it was revealed today.

Courts will be able to order more motorists who commit serious driving offences like speeding over 100mph to take an extended test that lasts twice as long as that faced by learners.

The proposals unveiled by the Department 
for Transport would extend the range of offences where an order can be made, such as 
serious cases of careless driving and speeding significantly over the limit.

A proposed crackdown on speeding drivers will see those caught at 100mph ordered to take an extend test to get their licence back

Currently extended tests are required for motorists banned for more than 56 days for dangerous driving, drink driving and other serious offences such as causing death by dangerous driving.

In the last financial year 5,299 motorists had to take extended car tests before being having their licences restored.

According to the latest figures from the Ministry of Justice more than 9,000 motorists were banned from driving for a single speeding offence by the courts last year.

Motoring groups believe around a third of these drivers could be hit by the proposals which are intended to act against the worst offenders.

They could be joined by around 1,000 more motorists who are banned by the courts for the worst cases of careless driving.

Under current sentencing guidelines issued to the courts, motorists caught driving at 30mph over the post speed limit should be given an immediate ban.

This is because it is believed that breaking the speed limit by such a margin poses a serious threat to other road users.

Andrew Howard, the AA's head of road safety, said: 'Driving at 100mph is not a minor slip. Everyone knows the national speed limit'.

'This means the worst drivers will be properly tested being allowed back on the road.'

Ministers announced last week that habitual drink drivers could have their cars seized as the Government attempts to tackle the problem of people getting behind the wheel when over the limit.

The move came after alarming figures revealed that a steep rise of motorists being convicted more than once for drink-driving offences.

Startling figures show that in 2000, 13,299 motorists received a second ban for drink driving - and this figure soared to 19,605 by 2009.

During this period, those disqualified from driving for at least the second time rose to 24 per cent from 16 per cent.

Drivers will lose the right to demand a second blood or urine test if they are found to be even fractionally over the limit when breathalysed.

This move is meant to clamp down on a loophole that means people can sober up while they await their new test.

An extended test lasts up to 85 minutes – double the length of that faced by normal learner – and costs £124 rather than the normal fee of £62.

The extended tests themselves are likely to be overhauled to take into account the offence which led to disqualification in the first place.

The initiative was welcomed by Robert Gifford, executive director of the Parliamentary Advisory Council for Transport Safety.

He told the Daily Telegraph: 'This is a timely move to ensure that the requirement to take an extended driving test also has an educational dimension.

'Carrying a driving licence is a significant responsibility and drivers need to be reminded of that. This should ensure that the extended driving test for serious offenders is fit for purpose.'

The proposals to increase the number of motorists being forced to take an extended test are included in a consultation unveiled by the Department for Transport intended to tighten the law on a range of motoring offences.

They are included in a package of measures which include a move to close the loophole that gives drivers marginally over the limit enough time to sober up and avoid a ban.

This will be done by removing their right to demand a second blood or urine test which, especially in rural areas, can take up to two hours to perform.
