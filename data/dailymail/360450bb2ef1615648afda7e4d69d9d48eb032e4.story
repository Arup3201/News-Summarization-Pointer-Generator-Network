Team news

Queens Park Rangers 

Adel Taarabt could be offered the opportunity to prove himself to manager Harry Redknapp when QPR host Aston Villa in the Premier League on Monday.

Taarabt and Redknapp had a public disagreement this week when the QPR boss accused the Morocco playmaker of being overweight.

Defender Nedum Onuoha hopes to shake off a hamstring problem sustained against Liverpool while midfielders Joey Barton and Jordon Mutch could be fit again after recent hamstring trouble, but Alejandro Faurlin (knee) is a long-term injury absentee.

Provisional squad: Green, McCarthy, Onuoha, Traore, Dunne, Caulker, Ferdinand, Yun, Hill, Isla, Henry, Sandro, Fer, Zamora, Vargas, Austin, Phillips, Kranjcar, Murphy, Hoilett, Vargas, Barton, Mutch, Taarabt.
