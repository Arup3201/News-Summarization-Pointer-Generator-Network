One of Britain’s rarest mammals is hovering on the brink of extinction.

There are only 1,000 grey long-eared bats left in the UK and their numbers are declining as a result of habitat loss, the Bat Conservation Trust has warned.

Researcher Dr Orly Razgour said the future survival of the species in Britain remains ‘questionable’, with small pockets remaining in the sought coast of England and the Channel Islands.

Researchers have warned that the future survival of grey long-eared bats in the UK is under threat due to the decline in lowland meadows and marshlands. There are only 1,000 of the mammals left in the UK in small pockets along the coast and on the Channel Islands

The grey long-eared bat is also known as the Plecotus austriacus.

It is a large European bat with long ears that have a distinctive fold.

Grey long-eared bats hunt above woodland, usually by day, and they mostly eat moths.

They are often confused with the common brown long-eared bat, and as a species was only distinguished in the 1960s.

Grey long-eared bats can be distinguished because they have a paler belly.

The frequencies used by this bat species for echolocation lie between 18-45 kHz, have most energy at 28 kHz and have an average duration of 5.8 ms.

She said the decline in the population of the long-eared bat is likely to have occurred as a result of a reduction in the bats' main foraging habitats - lowland meadows and marshlands – and has called for greater conservation efforts to protect the elusive mammal.

But changes in land use and farming practices means many of their feeding grounds have ‘all but disappeared in the UK’.

As the species prey on agricultural pests, an increase in numbers would benefit the farming community.  

‘The UK's grey long-eared bats need greater conservation efforts before we lose them,’ said Dr Razgour.

‘Despite being one the rarest UK mammals, up until recently there was very little known about the grey long-eared bat and what it needs to survive.

‘Studying the grey long-eared bat, I realised that the plight of this bat demonstrates many of the threats and conservation challenges facing wildlife, from the effects of habitat loss and climate change to the problem of small isolated populations.

‘The UK grey long-eared bat population has been declining and has become fragmented in the past century. This decline and fragmentation is likely to be in response to the dramatic decline of lowland meadows and marshlands, the bat's main foraging habitats.

Bats in the UK are protected by law - it is illegal to harm a bat, or to destroy or interfere with a bat roost. But the Channel Islands, one of the remaining strongholds for grey long-eared bats, do not have the same strict laws in place, and the BCT are calling for greater protection

‘The long-term survival of the grey long-eared bat UK population is closely linked to the conservation of these lowland meadows and marshland habitats.’

Traditionally a cave-dwelling species, they have become dependent on buildings such as lofts or barns for the large open spaces they use for roost sites.

More work needs to be done to protect maternity roost sites, where female bats raise their young, and spend the winter, said Dr Razgour, particularly because many are under threat from building development.

In total, there are 18 species of bats in Britain – making up almost a quarter of our native mammal species.

Colin and Jenny Currie have bats in the roof of their home on the Isle of Wight, including pipistrelles, Brandt’s bats and seven rare grey long-eared bats.

‘We moved here in 1983 and were told when we bought the place we had bats! We respect the fact they’re protected and like seeing what’s happening with the bats. 

When the scientists come to tag them we get to see them up close. They’re brilliant furry creatures. Beautiful,’ said the couple.

‘We feel it’s a privilege – particularly since they’re so rare. It’s great. The first time I saw them I’d gone into the attic.  

‘We’re hosts for them really, they’ll be here when we go. It’s lovely that they’re still there! They stayed despite us having our roof re-slated after the storm in 1988.

'We had special wood put in that is kind to bats and the roofers knew how important the bats were left various crevices so the bats can get in and out – the wood was treated with the correct stuff so the bats didn’t disappear.’

Bats in the UK are protected by law – it is illegal to harm a bat, or to destroy or interfere with a bat roost. But the Channel Islands, one of the remaining strongholds for grey long-eared bats, do not have the same strict laws in place, and the BCT are calling for greater protection.

Nicky Brown of the Jersey Bat Group said: ‘The Channel Islands are independent jurisdictions.

'Jersey is the only island with legislation to protect its bats.

'Even with legislation, the cumulative impact through development and habitat loss may be critical to the local survival of the species unless strategies for effective protection and enhancement can be implemented.’
