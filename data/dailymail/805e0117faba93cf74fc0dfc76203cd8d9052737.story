Expecting: Former prison guard Nancy Gonzalez poses on Facebook, showing off her baby bump as she prepares to give birth to the child of convicted cop killer Ronell Wilson

A 29-year-old prison guard who became pregnant during an affair with convicted cop-killer Ronnell Wilson, tested positive for cocaine, prosecutors at her arraignment said today.

Nancy Gonzales' lawyer admitted that she took the drug before her arrest in February to deal with 'stress', the attorney told Brooklyn Federal magistrate Judge James Orenstein in New York.

The eight-months pregnant former Metropolitan Detention Center guard, who was charged with having unlawful sex with an inmate, was asked to be put in a treatment program today after failing the drugs test, The New York Post reported.

Gonzales' defense lawyer Anthony Ricco said: 'She admitted that she had a relapse and she used cocaine prior to her being arrested.'

He added that she took the drug because of 'stress caused by her impending arrest and her personal circumstances.'

She has a previous history of drug abuse and tested positive to a test in 2011 which was taken by the Federal Bureau of Prisons.

Ricco blamed her youth and stress for the incident and said she intends to raise her child fully.

Gonzales is facing 15 years in prison after being arrested on suspicion that she
had hatched a plot with Ronnell Wilson to help save his life.

The convicted killer
allegedly impregnated Gonzales in a plot to avoid the death penalty and had been so desperate to father a child
that he offered to confess to the murders of two detectives, according to his
former lawyer.

Attorney Ephraim Savitt said that in 2006, his then-client
Ronell Wilson was poised to accept a plea deal as part of which he would accept
responsibility for the 2003 slayings of undercover detectives Rodney Andrews
and James Nemorin and be sentenced to a life in prison.

Explanation: Gonzalez allegedly said in a recorded phone conversation that she was 'vulnerable' when she decided to start a relationship with Wilson in a bid to give him some 'hope'

'Wilson advised me that he would take the life deal — as
long as he could have conjugal visits — because he was determined to leave this
earth with a child of his own, to give his wasted life some meaning, Savitt
told the New York Post.

For Wilson to be 
allowed to meet with women behind
bars, he would have had to be sent to a state prison, but his former 
attorney
said that the negotiations with the prosecution never went that far 
because Attorney general Alberto Gonzalez rejected the proposed 
agreement.

Sources told the newspaper in February that during his tryst with
Gonzalez last year, Wilson was also placing 'romantic' phone calls with three
other women from behind bars.

In the aftermath of Gonzalez’s arrest on suspicion that she
had hatched a plot with Wilson to help save his life, the father of one of the
slain officers, Rodney Andrews, spoke out against the idea that his son's
killer should be shown leniency just because he got the woman pregnant.

'Put him to death for what he did,' Rodney Andrews Sr told New
York Daily News. 'If he had 20 children, it wouldn't change my mind.'

The 72-year-old father went on to say that Ms Gonzalez does
not deserve any mercy either.

Change of heart: On her MySpace page, Gonzalez summed up her attitude toward children thus: 'Love kids, but not for me'

On her Facebook page, Gonzalez posted a photo last month depicting herself proudly showing off her swollen pregnant belly in a tight yellow T-shirt with the world 'Love' printed across the front.

Interestingly enough, on her MySpace page, the 29-year-old described her attitude towards children thus: 'Love kids, but not for me.'

Gonzalez was arrested on 
charges she intentionally had sex with Ronell Wilson while working the 
night shift at the Metropolitan Detention Center, which is against the 
law. She became pregnant in June, a few months into the affair, 
according to court papers.

Wilson
was a young gang member when he was convicted in the point-blank 
shootings of two undercover officers in an illegal gun sting gone awry.

‘I took a chance because I was so vulnerable and wanted to be loved and now I am carrying his child,’ Gonzalez said, according to court papers.

Wilson was sentenced to death in the killing of officers Rodney Andrews and James Nemorin, but the sentence was thrown out in 2010 by an appeals court.

Legal complications: Wilson's death sentence was thrown out after an appeals court found that a prosecutor had vilified the convicted killer

A new jury must decide his fate. But 
replay of the trial's penalty phase has been put off as Wilson's lawyers
seek to convince a judge that he's ineligible for the death penalty 
because he is mentally disabled.

Gonzales, who is eight months pregnant, was taken into custody at her Long Island home, New York Daily News reported. She could face 15 years in prison if convicted.

According
to a complaint, Wilson and Gonzales' scheme to help the convicted 
killer escape capital punishment was revealed by prison informants.

According
to one inmate, he witnessed the female guard moving away 
from Wilson's cell door while he was standing there with his pants down.

The complaint was made public and cited by CBS New York stated that the inmate and guard had sex in a vacant activity room while Gonzalez was supposed to be checking up on prisoners. The two were caught on video talking or hours at her desk in the kitchen.

Military career: Before taking a job as a federal corrections officer, Gonzalez served in the U.S. Army

One of many: While carrying on an affair with Gonzalez, pictured, Wilson was allegedly wooing three other women from behind bars

The corrections officer came clean about her affair with Wilson, which lasted between March and August 2012, in a taped phone conversation with her boyfriend, who is serving time in a state prison.

Gonzalez allegedly said she 'kind of got sucked into his world' and 'why not give him a child as far as giving him some kind of hope.

'I can’t explain it. I know what’s to come. I know what is going to be said about me,' Gonzalez allegedly said. 'I know that for me as a parent, how am I going to explain this to this little boy?'

It remains unknown what effect the uncovered plot will have on Wilson's mental retardation claim. He still faces life in prison or death by lethal injection.

'If this was done by design, it's not the actions of a person who is mentally retarded,' said Michael Palladino, president of the Detectives Endowment Association. 'It's a devious plot to avoid the death penalty.'

Insanity claim: Wilson's defense attorney argued that he cannot be executed because he is mentally handicapped

Wilson was found guilty in December 2006 of shooting detectives James Nemorin, 36, and Rodney Andrews, 34, in the back of their heads in a car March 10, 2003 in Staten Island.

The following year, he was sentenced to death, making him the first federal defendant in New York to face capital punishment since 1954.

However, an appeals court reversed the sentence in 2010 claiming than a prosecutor violated Wilson's constitutional rights by making him out to be a villain. 

Raymond Patterson, a noted psychiatrist who testified on behalf of the prosecution, told the New York Post that while Wilson suffers from anti-social personality disorder, he is not mentally handicapped.
