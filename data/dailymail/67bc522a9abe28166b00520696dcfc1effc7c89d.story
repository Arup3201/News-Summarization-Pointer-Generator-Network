Bodies of 186 victims who died when Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 was shot out of the sky have been located by rescuers, amid fierce accusations that Russia and pro-Russian rebels are trying to sabotage the investigation.

Emergency workers employed by the Ukrainian government were allowed to access the eight-square-mile crash site today, and later began to pile up bodies in the fields.

But independent investigators dispatched to the scene complained that they were being kept out.

At the same time authorities accused the rebels in control of the site of spiriting away dead bodies, looting their possessions and plotting to remove chunks of the downed plane.

Operation: Rescue forces have started retrieve and remove bodies of passengers from the crash site of MH17

Crash site: Ukrainian rescue workers have been allowed into the site to start collecting bodies of the victims

Tributes: Locals have come out in their droves to leave flowers and tributes to the dead among the flowers as the investigation continues

While residents have been able to leave flowers, staff of Europe's OSCE claim they were blocked from the site

Grief: Women of the nearby town look on at the wreckage in horror as many bodies remain in the fields

Members of the Ukrainian Emergency Ministry worked late into the night retrieving bodies in body bags

Staff from Europe's OSCE security body visited the site but complained that they did not get the full access they wanted.

‘We encountered armed personnel who acted in a very impolite and unprofessional manner. Some of them even looked slightly intoxicated,’ a spokesman said.

Yesterday another OSCE expert told CNN that it seemed as if nobody was in control of the site. Michael Bociurkiw, said: 'It basically looks like the biggest crime scene in the world right now, guarded by a bunch of guys in uniform with heavy firepower who are quite inhospitable.

'And there didn't seem to be anyone really in control, for example. One of our top priorities was to find out what happened to the black boxes. No one was there to answer those questions.' Ukraine's government today also issued a statement complaining rebels had not handed over the black boxes.

Describing the site today, the spokesman said: 'Some of the body bags are open and the damage to the corpses is very, very bad. It is very difficult to look at.'

Authorities are focussing on moving bodies to the morgue in Donetsk, leaving belongings behind

Retrieve: Ukrainian rescuers have been working at the scene to remove the victims, in body bags, from the site

Blockade? Rebel soldiers, such as those pictured, have been accused of hindering reporters and investigators - and even of being drunk on the job

Horrific: Days after the crash, bodies an personal effects remain strewn across the eastern Ukraine field

Bodies are still strapped to seats as reinforcements are called in to help with the identification process

Harrowing: Describing the site today, a spokesman said: 'Some of the body bags are open and the damage to the corpses is very, very bad. It is very difficult to look at'

Victims: Ukrainian officials chose to line the bodies up at the side of the crash site before removing them today

Escort: Representatives from the OSCE arrive at the crash site surrounded by pro-Russian fighters

Standoff: World leaders have demanded that the rebels around Donetsk allow proper access to the site

Pressure: Even Russia has emphasised the importance of allowing international monitors to the site

He confirmed
 that the 24-member delegation was given further access to the crash 
site today but their movements were being limited by the rebels.

He
 said: 'We have to be very careful with our movements because of all the
 security. We are unarmed civilians, so we are not in a position to 
argue with people with heavy arms.'

Senior
 politicians in Malaysia today warned the rebels against touching 
anything in the site - describing any interference as a 'betrayal' of 
the victims.

Transport
 Minister Mr Liow Tiong Lai said: 'Interfering with the scene of the 
crash would undermine the investigation itself. Any action that prevents
 us from learning the truth about what happened to MH17 cannot be 
tolerated.

‘Such interference would be a betrayal of the lives that were lost,’ he said.

Footage broadcast today by Sky News
 shows a rebel commander telling massed journalists and officials: 'Whoever disobeys my orders will be dealt with accordingly.'

'I 
have told you many times - you are on the territory of the Donetsk 
People’s Republic. You are being taken out of here. This is the order of your guards.'

Today
 Ukraine's government accused pro-Russian rebels in eastern Ukraine of 
trying to destroy evidence at the crash site of removing 38 bodies from 
the scene.

'The
 government of Ukraine officially states that the terrorists, with the 
help of Russia, are trying to destroy evidence of international crimes,'
 a statement said.

'According to government data, the terrorists 
have taken 38 bodies to the morgue in Donetsk,' it said, accusing 
specialists with 'strong Russian accents' of threatening to carry out 
their own autopsies.

Grief: Mourners continued to gather in hope of more news of the crash. Pictured is a distraught woman outside Schiphol airport in Amsterdam

Debris: Alexander Hug, Deputy Chief Monitor of the OSCE mission, stands in front of a piece of fallen fuselage

Proximity: The armed men guarded the movements of the officials closely as they inspected the site 

Mission: A convoy of vehicles arrive with the European observers, surrounded by armed militiamen

Scene: The officials took photos of fallen debris, including a Apple Mac laptop left virtually intact

'The 
government of Ukraine officially states that the terrorists, with the 
help of Russia, are trying to destroy evidence of international crimes,' a statement said.

'According
 to government data, the terrorists have taken 38 bodies to the morgue 
in Donetsk,' it said, accusing specialists with 
'strong Russian accents' of threatening to carry out their own 
autopsies. It also said rebels were 'seeking large transports to carry away plane fragments to Russia'.

Rescue workers have been allowed on to the 
site, Ukraine said, and have found 186 of the 298 bodies - but have been
 stopped from taking anything away.

A government spokesman said: 
'At 7 a.m. on July 19, 186 bodies have been found. The area that needs 
to be checked stands at 25 square km. Eighteen square km have already 
been checked.'

'The fighters have allowed Emergencies Ministry 
workers in there, but they do not allow them to take anything from the 
area. The fighters are taking away all that has been found.'

OSCE inspectors will visit the crash site throughout the week. International agencies are now trying to figure out concretely who launched the missile

Reflection: Three observers look away from an area of debris with the village of Rasssypnoye in the background

Investigation: Mr Hug directs the group of inspectors to an area of the crash site 

The rebels have also been accused of 
looting the corpses of the dead and rifling through their luggage, also 
by the Ukrainian government.

Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to the
 Kiev government, said: 'I have received information that terrorist 
death-hunters were collecting not only cash and jewelery of the crashed 
Boeing dead passengers but also the credit cards of the victims.

'Currently, they might as well try to use them in Ukraine or pass them on to Russia.

'My
 humble request to the relatives of the victims to freeze their credit 
cards, so that they won't lose their assets to terrorists.'

There
 were also claims today that British victim John Alder, a 63-year-old 
Newcastle United fan on his way to see the team play in New Zealand, had
 his case looted.

A 
freelance journalist on the scene said that he saw rebels take a pair of
 binoculars from his suitcase, then throw them away when they discovered
 they were broken.

A network of high-tech eavesdropping and early-warning satellites operated by the Pentagon most likely played a key role in determining that the Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was shot down by a Russian-made surface-to-air missile over the Ukraine.

According to a report by the Los Angeles Times, intelligence officials almost certainly relied on a technical discipline known as measurement and signature intelligence, also known as MASINT, to obtain key bits of information about the missile launch.

The sophisticated system of satellites at the Pentagon’s disposal could have pinpointed the location from which the missile was fired and plotted out its trajectory as it shot up into the sky on a collision course with the MH17 Flight.

Riki Ellison, founder and chairman of Missile Defense Advocacy Alliance, an industry lobby, told the paper that intelligence analysts would have become aware the missile launch because of its heat signature.

U.S. Air Force-operated satellites orbiting the Earth are equipped with hyper-sensitive sensors that pick up on heat from missile and booster plumes. In fact, the detectors are so fine-tuned that they even spot forest fires.

The system of satellites, run as part of the Defense Support Program, sends back early warnings each time it detects an intercontinental ballistic missile launch.

Also, American radars scattered around Europe have the capacity to provide data on the exact launch site, the missile’s destination and its speed.

The other vital intelligence tool is a fleet of U.S. listening satellites that collect electronic signals from foreign defense systems.

Armed with this data, U.S. analysts would be able to determine the source of the signals and the weapon used.

The Russian-made Buk missiles, like the one that downed the jet Thursday with 298 people on board, are equipped with a radar system that gives off unique signals, making it possible to triangulate the launch site and trace its route.
