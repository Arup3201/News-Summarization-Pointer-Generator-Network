'Grooming': Sir Jimmy Savile was being investigated by Newsnight over claims he abused teenage girls in the 1970s

The BBC shelved a Newsnight investigation into allegations that Sir Jimmy Savile sexually abused teenage girls at its studios, it has been revealed.

The current affairs show was looking into a woman's claim that the late TV star molested her when she was 14 or 15, in his dressing rooms at a recording of 1970s show Clunk Click.

Newsnight then spoke to several other women who said Savile exploited his role as presenter on the hit programme to groom and abuse girls.

They also heard claims that two other - living - celebrities abused girls at BBC Television Centre in the 1970s, according to The Oldie magazine.

A Newsnight report was due to be screened in December, two months after Savile's death, but was pulled by bosses.

That month, the BBC broadcast two tribute programmes celebrating Savile's career presenting popular shows including Jim'll Fix It and Top of the Pops.

The Corporation has now been accused of attempting to cover up the allegations in an effort to protect its own reputation.

A BBC News source told the Daily Telegraph: 'The extreme nature of the claims about Savile meant that the Newsnight report was going to seriously compromise the lavish BBC tributes scheduled to run later the same month.

'The allegations directly involved the BBC, in that the woman who gave the interview said she and others were abused by Savile on BBC premises.'

All the women making the allegations 
attended Duncroft Approved School in Staines, Surrey, which Savile 
visited on regular occasions.

Two said Savile took them for drives in his car and gave them gifts of cigarettes, records, money and places in the Clunk Click audience, in exchange for 'sexual favours'.

One of the women, now in her 50s, is said to have agreed to waive her anonymity to speak to Newsnight on camera.

Surrey Police received a complaint five years ago from a woman who said Savile indecently assaulted her in the 1970s when she was a pupil at Duncroft. Her allegation was investigated but no further action taken.

The police have not been contacted by the BBC regarding the latest claims.

The BBC has denied the claims.

Peter Rippon, Newsnight Editor, said:
 'It is absolutely untrue that the Newsnight investigation was dropped 
for anything other than editorial reasons.

'We have been very clear from the 
start that the piece was not broadcast because the story we were 
pursuing could not be substantiated.

'To say otherwise is false and very 
damaging to the BBC and individuals. To allege that we are withholding 
evidence from the police is also damaging and false. The notion that 
internal pressure was applied appears to be a malicious rumour'.

A BBC spokesman said: 'Any suggestion that a story was dropped for anything other than editorial reasons is completely untrue. The BBC gathers information on hundreds of stories and not all make it to air. In this case the angle we were pursuing could not be substantiated.'

BBC 
director-general Mark Thompson is said to have heard that the 
investigation was taking place, but to have played no role in its being 
shelved.

Savile - a 
long-standing BBC television and radio star - died aged 84 in October, 
but now his reputation looks in danger of permanent damage.

Clunk
 Click was his first solo series, following his campaign to get the 
nation using seatbelts, entitled 'Clunk click every trip.'

Distressed friends and family of the former broadcaster last month accused Newsnight of ‘muckraking’.

Savile's friend of 30 years, Stephen Purdew, helped organise the funeral for the TV legend, who also raised £40million for charity during his career.

Mr Purdew said: ‘These are allegations from 40 years ago. He’s not even alive to defend himself. Sir Jim was a great man, a legend who should be remembered for all the wonderful things he did for other people.’

Niece Janet Humble said: ‘It looks like muckraking. As a family we just wish Sir Jim could be left to rest in peace. He did more good than bad in his life and how many celebrities can say that?’

Sir Jimmy started his working life as a miner before running a series of clubs and working as a wrestler and then a DJ. He died at home in Leeds on October 29 last year, two days before his 85th birthday.

His private life had long been the 
subject of gossip and speculation and in December, divorcee Georgina 
Ray, 40, claimed to be the TV star’s secret love child.

She said her mother had a brief fling
 with the presenter while working as a waitress in the 1970s, and that 
she is seeking a DNA test to prove she is Sir Jimmy’s daughter.

At his two-hour Requiem Mass 
in St Anne's Cathedral, Leeds, colleagues from TV and radio joined Sir Jimmy's family and friends as thousands 
of well-wishers watched outside on big screens.

The broadcasting legend chose the most elevated position in the peaceful
 Woodlands Cemetery, in the Yorkshire town of Scarborough, for its spectacular 
sea view.

He was buried with his Royal Marines green beret and medal, rosary beads and Help For Heroes wristband and the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall led the tributes to him.

His headstone is soon to be 
inscribed with the words 'It was great while it lasted’, ­alongside 
three pictures of him during his stellar career.
