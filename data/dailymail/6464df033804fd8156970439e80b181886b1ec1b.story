Hollywood actor Gerard Butler's video of a wild helicopter ride has caught the attention of Australian aviation authorities.

The clip, which shows the chopper flying dangerously low at a beach in the Northern Territory, was aired on US late-night talk show Jimmy Kimmel Live in June.

The Civil Aviation Safety Authority told Daily Mail Australia that the footage is currently being reviewed but an investigation has not yet been launched.

In the 20 second clip, a black Robinson helicopter can be seen flying at high speed and circling around Butler and others on the beach.

The pilot's flying techniques are further shown as he circles around, aiming its rotor at the men before it lands a few metres away.

Butler tells talk-show host Kimmel that he's only released footage of 'the tame stuff'.

'This is how we were flying about,' he said.

'We didn't even upload the best bit of this where we were spinning around at 70 miles per hour and him in the chopper right above us.'

The Scottish actor refrained from revealing the pilot's name but said: 'this stuff is evidence he's insane'.

Peter Gibson, the spokesman for CASA, says they were alerted about the video on Thursday.

'The registration of the helicopter is unclear from the video but we are looking into it,' he said.

'We treat these kind of potential unsafe operations very seriously and it's for the inspectors to determine whether there will be an investigation.'

Mr Gibson did not comment on whether the helicopter pilot breached any safety rules.

When the vision was filmed, Butler was on a tour in the Top End while working on his latest movie Gods of Egypt in Australia.
