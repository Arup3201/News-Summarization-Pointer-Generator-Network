Police have come under fire for asking homeowners whether they were gay or bisexual in a Neighbourhood Watch survey

Police have come under fire for asking homeowners whether they were gay or bisexual - in a Neighbourhood Watch survey.

The questionnaire by West Midlands Police asked residents in Birmingham questions about their sexual orientation so they could help officers 'detect crime and anti-social behaviour.'

The force claim that by asking whether people were straight, gay or bi-sexual it would help them decide where certain information about police initiatives should be best sent.

But residents and politicians in the city have accused the police of being too politically correct.

Gary Harper, 30, from Kitts Green, Birmingham, said: 'It's complete leftie nonsense and completely irrelevant. 

'West Midlands Police need to mind their own business.'

Electrician Paul Potter, 30, added: 'What has being gay got to do with Neighbourhood Watch schemes.

'It's ridiculous. It's another example of authorities trying to be too politically correct and it just makes them look stupid.'

It comes two months after the city's council was ridiculed for asking residents their sexual orientation in a quiz on wheelie bins.

Birmingham councillor Deirdre Alden said she was baffled by the survey.

She said: 'It seems West Midlands Police is following the same politically correct pathway for which the council was derided.

'You would have thought the police commissioner would have learned from that.

'Notes attached to the form claim that personal data will be used to prevent and detect crime, reduce nuisance, anti-social behaviour and disorder and improve community safety.

A spokeswoman for West Midlands Police said quizzing residents on their sexual orientation allowed the force to target different cross-sections of the community.

She said: 'West Midlands Police regularly sends information about crime and policing initiatives to cross sections of the community and surveys such as this one to Neighbourhood Watch members helps us to target these messages and make sure they go to the right people.

'There may be an issue specific to a particular group in the community and we can make sure they are informed.

'The equality question is just one part of the survey about how people receive information from the police and includes questions of gender, ethnicity and faith.

'People can choose whether to give this information. The force takes equal opportunities and diversity extremely seriously. 

'This week it backed a national campaign to raise awareness of homophobic and transphobic hate crime and to encourage residents to speak out.'
