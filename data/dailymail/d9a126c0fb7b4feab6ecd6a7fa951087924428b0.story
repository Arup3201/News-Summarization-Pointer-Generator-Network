When the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a law Wednesday morning that limits Americans' contributions to political candidates, liberals in Washington hyperventilated.

Within minutes, far-left Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York fired off a terse press release slapping the five justices, all appointees of Republican presidents, who joined in a majority to open the floodgates to more money in politics.

'This in itself is a small step, but another step on the road to ruination,' said Schumer.

'It could lead to interpretations of the law that would result in the end of any fairness in the political system as we know it.'

Democrats in the US Senate practically hyperventilated Wednesday after the Supreme Court struck down campaign donation limits

A relative handful of protesters angry about corporate money in politics held court as the decision came down

Bernie Sanders, a Democratic senator from Vermont who describes himself as a socialist, tweeted his disgust.

'To equate the ability of billionaires to buy elections with "freedom of speech" is totally absurd,' he wrote.Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Rhode Island Democrat, took on the Supreme Court directly.

'The court is utterly ignorant about elections. Not one of them has ever stood for office,' Whitehouse said during a press conference. 'They have the enthusiasm of amateurs and think they know what they're talking about and in fact they're just dead wrong.'

The conservative judges' decision, he lamented, was rooted in a 'lack of humility.'

In a crowded field of congressional reactions, it's common for the most outrageous sound bites to be heard most clearly.

But Democrats – and one leftward tilting Republican – see the decision in 'McCutcheon v. Federal Election Commission' as a sequel to the controversial 'Citizens United' case, and it genuinely seemed to upset them.

Arizona GOP Sen. John McCain predicted in a statement 'that as a result of recent Court decisions, there will be scandals involving corrupt public officials and unlimited, anonymous campaign contributions that will force the system to be reformed once again.'

Sen. Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, warned that the Supreme Court ruling 'could lead to interpretations of the law that would result in the end of any fairness in the political system as we know it'

His namesake 2002 Mccain-Feingold law reformed the use of 'soft money' in U.S. politics, a subject on which he has continued to be heard in the twelve years since its passage.

Both the latest decision and 'Citizens United' overturned long-held limits on money in elections. Democratic politicians have finely honed the art of loudly objecting to the presence of seven- and eight-figure purses weighing in every two years, especially demonizing David and Charles Koch, a brotherly duo of libertarian big spenders.

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has been this spring's most prolific Koch-basher, mentioning them by name five times in a four minute speech on Tuesday about House Republicans' budget proposal – a document that he claims was written to appease the larger-than-life political donors.

'It's a blueprint for a modern ... how would we say this? Koch-topia. Yes, that's it,' Reid said on the Senate floor.

'Call it whatever you want. We might as well call it the Koch budget because that's what they're doing, protecting the Koch brothers.'

True to form, Reid targeted the duo after the Supreme Court handed down its decision.

The ruling, he told reporters, 'take[s] away people's rights; because, as you know, the Koch brothers are trying to buy America.'

Democrats, too, have their billionaire sugar daddies. George Soros has poured hundreds of millions into issue advocacy groups and directly into campaign coffers.

And Tom Steyer has put up nearly $100 million this year in order to push climate change as part of Democratic campaign platforms.

The McCutcheon case will please fundraisers on both sides, just in time for November's midterm congressional elections.

Maverick: Arizona GOP Sen. John McCain bucked the trend and joined with Democrats who were angry at the nation's top jurists

The Supreme Court left in place the legal limits on how much an individual can donate to any single candidate. But the aggregate limits have been eliminated.

Before Wednesday morning, a single donor could contribute a maximum of $123,200 to candidates in each two-year election cycle, including no more than $48,600 directly to candidates and another $74,600 to political action committees and the political parties themselves.

Democrats – including President Barack Obama's solicitor general Donald Verilli, who argued the case – worry about a scenario where money could be moved between campaign funds if someone 'maxed out' all his or her potential giving.

In all, $3.6 million can now be donated every two years. that includes the maximum allowed for every House and Senate races, for Democratic or Republican Parties in all 50 states, and for the national parties.

Theoretically, either party could conspire to more much of that money into a single high-stakes campaign, effectively busting the new ceiling for a wealthy giver.

Barely a week ago the Supreme Court was thrust into the national spotlight, hearing oral arguments in an emotional case centering on whether Obamacare requires employers to pay for health care provisions that offend their religious beliefs

But during oral arguments, Justice Samuel Alito was skeptical.

'What I see are wild hypotheticals that are not obviously plausible and lack certainly any empirical support,' he told Verilli.

In the end, Chief Justice Roberts had the last word, writing for the majority that '[c]ontributing money to a candidate is an exercise of an individual's right to participate in the electoral process through both political expression and political association.'

'A restriction on how many candidates and committees an individual may support is hardly a 'modest restraint' on those rights,' he added.

'The Government may no more restrict how many candidates or causes a donor may support than it may tell a newspaper how many candidates it may endorse.'
