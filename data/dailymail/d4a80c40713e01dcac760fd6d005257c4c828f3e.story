They watched each other's back for seven months in Afghanistan before being forced to split.

Now US Marine Sergeant Sam Wettstein has been reunited with military dog Belle after three months apart. 

'I was missing a part of me. I was 
trying to fill the void and now my void is filled,' the 23-year-old told NBC 7. 'Having that kind of a relationship with a dog, you know, you get this 
bond.'

Wettstein and the three-year-old Labrador reunited on Friday at San Diego's Lindbergh Field. He will care for the dog at his California home.

'Belle! Hello, gorgeous!' Wettstein called out as the Lab ran to him. 'Come here.'

Wettstein and his pooch served together in Afghanistan, trained to seek out Improvised Explosive Devices.

'She gives a certain change that I am supposed to focus on and realize what it is,' Wettstein, who is still on active duty, said.

'She did her best, I did my best. When you’re both on the same page and you’re doing your job correctly things seem to look a lot better at the end of the day.'

The deployment ended in April, and Belle was sent to North Carolina for more training.

Not long after, Wettstein learned Belle was being retired.

The heartwarming reunion was facilitated by the American Humane Association and Mission K-9 Rescue.

'It’s a beautiful sight. These guys 
deploy together – they’ve been through something that we will never 
understand,' Mission K-9 Rescue's Kristin Maurer said.

'These dogs protected them day in and day out. They were 
their battle buddy and vice versa, so they have a deep bond.'

Military dogs like Belle each save the lives of up to 200 military service members during their deployment, according to Wisconsin Rapids Tribune.
