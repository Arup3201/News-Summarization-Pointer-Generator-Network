Spared jail: Would-be teacher Abi Ellis appearing at Truro Crown Court after attacking another girl on a night out by biting her face

A pretty undergraduate and wannabe teacher who has twice BITTEN women in the face during boozed up brawls has been spared jail.

Violent Abi Ellis, 20, sank her teeth into startled Katie Roberts during her most recent attack - after the two women clashed outside a nightclub.

Ellis is prone to losing her temper and when she does she likes to lash out and 'bite', a court was told.

The latest 'violent and extremely antisocial' assault left Miss Roberts with a gaping wound to her cheek which later became infected.

Both girls had gone to Falmouth School but the former pupils were not friends, Truro Crown Court in Cornwall heard.

The pair were attending separate birthday parties when Ellis spilt a drink on Miss Roberts and they exchanged words.

Trouble flared again outside Truro’s L2 nightspot when Katie went to get in a pre-booked taxi with her brother - only to find Ellis in the vehicle.

But when Katie asked Ellis what she was doing, the brunette attacked her and bit into her left cheek.

She was found guilty of causing actual bodily harm, ordered to carry out a community order for 12 months, undertake 180 hours unpaid work and pay her victim £500.

The court heard Ellis had been cautioned by police in June 2011 for a similar incident involving another girl.

Thomas Bradnock, prosecuting, said: 'You bit her I suggest because that is what you do when you lose your temper, isn’t it? You bite.

'It is what happened almost a year previously with a different girl.'

Katie told the court: 'I was obviously very shocked that she was in my brother’s taxi and I said, ‘what is she doing?’

'She launched at me and by that time her teeth were in my cheek and gripped on very tightly. I touched my cheek and there was blood on my hand. I was very emotional.'

Scene: The disagreement occurred outside Truro's L2 nightclub, which resulted in Ms Ellis biting a fellow reveller's cheek

The wound later became infected and Katie, reported the attack shortly after it happened on December 18, 2011.

Ellis spent Christmas in Ireland before travelling to Thailand, where she spent nine months teaching English, but was arrested upon her return.

Mr Bradnock said Ellis had been cautioned by police in June 2011 for a similar incident involving another girl.

He told her: 'You bit her I suggest because that is what you do when you lose your temper, isn’t it? You bite. It is what happened almost a year previously with a different girl.'

Ellis, a Tesco receptionist about to start an English literature and language degree at Brighton University in just a few weeks, claimed the bite was in self defence.

Recorder James Waddington told Ellis, of Falmouth, Cornwall, she had come close to going to jail.

He said: 'The matter has taken a long time because you made yourself scarce after this incident. You decided to go out of the area, no doubt hoping that matters would calm down.

'Be in no doubt that this was a serious assault and it is futile trying to offload responsibility on to your unfortunate victim. It was wholly unacceptable, violent and extremely antisocial.'
