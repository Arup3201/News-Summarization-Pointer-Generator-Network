This is the moment a father battered a bus passenger and temporarily blinded him with pepper spray after he asked the man's two children to stop throwing sweets at him.

CCTV images released by West Midlands Police show the 'barbaric' assault on the terrified victim that happened in front of the thug's two children.

The 21-year-old victim had been travelling alone through Birmingham city centre on January 11 when the suspect and a woman got on the number 24 bus with their young children.

A bus passenger was temporarily blinded with pepper spray and subjected to a prolonged beating after asking a man to stop children throwing sweets at him

The 21-year-old was travelling on the top deck of the number 24 bus along Birmingham's Broad Street when he was set up by a man

After the children started throwing sweets at him, the man asked the father whether he could tell them to stop.

Footage then shows the yob taking exception to the request and storming to the back of the bus where he punches the defenceless victim.

The one minute 14 second long clip then shows the father also launch a series of knees and kicks to the face - with his female partner also shamelessly joining in the attack.

Shockingly, the entire assault, which lasted seven minutes, took place in front of the pair's two young children.

At one point the suspect can be seen calmly sitting down next to his victim at the back of the bus talking before he starts punching him again.

The attacker, the woman and children then left the bus at a stop near the Green Man pub in the Harborne area of the city.

It's understood the offender squirted pepper spray in the man'Â­s eyes before both he and a woman tormented him with sporadic physical and verbal outbursts over a seven-minute period

The victim, from Woodgate, Birmingham, was treated at hospital for a badly broken nose and other facial injuries.

Police are now appealing for witnesses to the assault, which took place as the bus passed along Birmingham's Broad Street entertainment complex.

Pc Rob Harper, from West Midlands Police, said: 'The man was minding his own business when he politely asked the group to stop throwing sweets at him - but that request prompted a barbaric, prolonged attack.

Police are now appealing for witnesses to come forward to help find the thug

'The victim had something like pepper spray squirted in his face which rendered him defenceless as the blows rained down on him.

'At one stage the attacker stands on a seat to get a better kicking angle, whilst the woman he was with also occasionally joined in the assault.

'The victim was lucky to escape with only a broken nose as it could have been much worse.

'What makes this even more shocking is that they unleashed this attack in front of the two children they were travelling with.

'These are clear CCTV images of both the main offender and the woman with him - if you recognise them or think you've seen them please call us.'
