An amateur footballer was gunned down by a gangland hitman in front of 150 spectators as he was warming up for a match with teammates.

Alan Jopson, 27, was doing stretch exercises just before kick-off at a playing field in Liverpool when the masked gunman calmly jogged on to the pitch and shot him in the legs.

The victim was hit three times in both legs and lay reeling in agony as the would-be assassin fled in a silver getaway car.

Crowd in shock: Alan Jopson was gunned down when a hitman jogged calmly on to a pitch at Simpson Playing Fields, Liverpool, on Saturday afternoon

Jopson, who plays for West Derby side Alder, was treated in hospital for non life-threatening injuries and is believed to have given a statement to police.

Liverpool is currently in the grip of a string of tit-for-tat shootings.

The gunman struck shortly before 2pm on Saturday as the match between amateur league clubs Allerton FC and Alder, in Division 1 of the Liverpool County Premier League, was about to kick off.

As the teams ventured out on to a pitch at the busy Simpson Playing Fields in Woolton, the gunman pulled into the car park at the grounds in a silver vehicle, got out and ran on to the grass after them.

Peter Woods, Allerton secretary, said: 'I was in the changing room and the next thing I knew, when I went outside to watch the game, everyone was running away as fast as they could.

'There must have been 100 people there, maybe 150, all milling around. Everyone just fled.

'I couldn't believe it when I found out that the lad had been shot. The city is gun crazy - shootings outside schools, on football pitches. It is ridiculous.'

Liverpool County Premier league 
secretary Iain Munro said: 'It's a busy ground and a number of games 
were about to start. It's shocking.

'We know it's not a football-related incident. The victim was targeted as the person knew where they were playing football. The gunman came on the field while the teams were warming up, identified a player, and shot him three times.'

The game was immediately abandoned and the car park, the playing fields and surrounding area were cordoned off for forensic investigations to take place.

A spokesman for Alder FC also said the incident was 'not football-related'.

He added: 'We have got absolutely nothing to do with what happened.'

Merseyside Police confirmed the shooting was a targeted attack, but the motive was not yet known.

Ch Supt Ngaire Waine said: 'It's a very rare thing to happen anywhere - let alone a football pitch.

'It was brazen reckless attack in full daylight which showed a total disregard for the safety of other people. We've identified over 80 people who witnessed it. '
