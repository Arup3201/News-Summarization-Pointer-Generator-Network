The parents of two 'best friend' sisters who were killed in a car crash while on holiday in Morocco will never know what caused the accident.

British representatives in Morocco were unable to obtain any information or evidence from local agencies into the deaths of Pippa and Tara Darlington, two 'best friends' who died on the 'adventure of a lifetime', an inquest has heard.

A senior coroner today criticised foreign governments and agencies for making it increasingly difficult to obtain evidence into British citizens dying abroad.

The two 'beautiful' and dynamic' sisters were killed in a horrific road accident while on holiday.

Pippa Darlington, a 21-year-old law student at Newcastle University, was driving a VW Golf northbound on the N1, just 14km south of the town of Tarfaya.

She and her elder sister Tara, a 23-year-old media student at Goldsmiths College in London who was sitting in the front passenger seat, died at the scene from multiple traumatic injuries.

The inquest, at Salisbury Coroner's Court, Wiltshire, heard their car lost control and veered across the carriageway at around 5am local time.

Their friend Joshua Stump, then 21, was a backseat passenger in the car when it struck a Renault Clio coming in the opposite direction and spun into a head-on collision with a 4x4.

Mr Stump was seriously injured in the collision along with four other people, while five people were treated for minor injuries.

Pippa, Tara and Joshua had arrived in Morocco together two days earlier on September 15 2012 on their travels through Africa, where they also visited Mauritania.

The sisters, from from Whiteparish near Salisbury, were described as 'each other's soulmates' in moving family statements at the time of their death. 

Mr Ridley today said that despite attempts to ascertain why Pippa lost control, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office were unable to produce evidence for the inquest.

He added the Moroccan authorities may not have even conducted any investigation at all and that Joshua was unable to help with evidence because he was asleep at the time.

He added that during his time as a coroner, his investigations have been hampered because he has encountered such problems more regularly in recent years.

Resuming an inquest into their deaths in southern Morocco on September 17 2012, Mr Ridley today said: 'This has taken two and a half years to get to this stage.

'The reason it's taken such a long time is the efforts of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to liaise through diplomatic channels with the Moroccan government.

'A state representative said there have been numerous attempts to secure results of investigations carried out.

'While there is a responsibility on a coroner to carry out an investigation the trouble is we don't always get evidence from crime scenes in relation to that investigation.

'We rely on the corporations, foreign governments and the agencies in those foreign countries to assist and sadly in this case the Foreign and Commonwealth Office's attempts to get evidence into the deaths of both Pippa and Tara has failed.

'This happens, sadly, and the problem is increasing in recent years. I'm not going to say anything further on the subject but it makes our ability to carry out investigations very difficult.'

Recording verdicts of death by road traffic collision, he added: 'I'm sorry our efforts to produce more information in relation to their deaths and perhaps to how Pippa came to lose control of the vehicle have not produced results.

'It may be the case there was no investigation as would have normally been the case if an incident occurred in England and Wales. We have bespoke road traffic collision investigators.

'They were driving to this remote location of this particular incident and that may be why our efforts have not produced anything more substantial.'

He continued: 'I offer my sincere condolences to the family and friends and on that note I bring the inquest finally to a close.' 

Their heartbroken parents Patrick and Emma Darlington parents told of their 'complete devastation' and said their daughters had brought 'light and laughter to whoever met them' in statements released at the time of their deaths. 

Former wine merchant Patrick and his life coach wife Emma said: 'We are as a family completely devastated at the loss of both our daughters.

Their friend Joshua Stump, then 21, was a backseat passenger in the car when it struck a Renault Clio coming in the opposite direction and spun into a head-on collision with a 4x4

'They were two of the most beautiful, dynamic, energetic and fun-loving girls who brought light and laughter to whoever met them.

'They made a difference to so many lives and they lit up every room on entering.

'This trip was to be an adventure of a lifetime for which they had planned, worked hard and saved together for months to be able to do.'

Both girls were about to enter their final years at university with Tara, who had been offered a job in New York, looking at a career in journalism and Pippa in law.

The devastated Darlingtons described Tara as 'beautiful, charming and vivacious' and Pippa, who obtained three As at A Level, as 'off-the-wall, fun, thoughtful and loyal'. 

The Darlingtons added: 'They were having the time of their life and promised to be home in ten days.'

The girls' younger brother Oscar, then 15, added: 'They are my darling sisters and I love them very much. I was just reaching an age where we could do things together.

'Gone so soon but will never be forgotten and always in my heart.'

The family chose not to attend today's inquest.
