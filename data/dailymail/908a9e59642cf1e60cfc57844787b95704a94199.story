Tiger Woods has admitted he withdrew from Ryder Cup contention because he felt unable to win a single point for the United States due to ongoing back problems.

The 14-time major winner looked a broken man during his slump at the US PGA Championship and it was no surprise last week when he said he would not be available as a wildcard pick for the Gleneagles showpiece.

Woods’s season has lurched from one misery to another after undergoing surgery on a herniated disc in March. The 38-year-old endured a very public failure on his comeback, posting his worst 72-hole finish in a major at The Open and missing the cut at the US PGA as Rory McIlroy cleaned up both prizes.

Pain game: Woods has been struggling with injury for a while and decided to withdraw from the Ryder Cup

‘Physically, I couldn’t do it,’ Woods admitted to Sky Sports News about the Ryder Cup, which begins in Scotland on September 26. 

‘I wouldn’t be ready and not being able to be there for my team-mates, the captain, assistant captain and everyone that’s involved in the event, I just wouldn’t be ready and I just couldn’t help the team.

‘When your name is called you have to be able to go out there and get a point and I just didn’t feel like I could be ready enough to get a point.

‘With that being said it was time to shut it down, get stronger, get more explosive again.’

Woods is now working solely on rebuilding his fitness in the gym and insisted he will not pick up a club for a month. 

The target for his next comeback is the World Challenge at Isleworth in Florida during the first week of December.

‘Now I need to keep (the back) calm, then strengthen it and then I’ll be back. That’s one of the reasons I’ve shut it down. I’ll come back in December and be ready for next year.’
