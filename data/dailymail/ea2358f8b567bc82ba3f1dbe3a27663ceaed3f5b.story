The Harvard-educated professor mysteriously shot dead inside his own home was found in the garage after being ambushed there, according to a Tallahassee Police Department report released on Friday.

The heavily redacted report only adds to the mystery surrounding the death of Florida State University Professor Dan Markel, 41, who was found inside his locked home on Friday 18 July having been shot point-blank in the head.

And police sources who have spoken to MailOnline today have indicated that they believe Markel did not necessarily know his killer, rather he was 'specifically targeted' for this murder - raising the possibility that the Cambridge educated law expert was the subject of a contract killing.

The police report also reveals that Markel's 2008 black Honda Accord was not locked inside the garage, however, it does not indicate where in the garage the father-of-two's body was discovered.

The incident report of the baffling murder notes the specific time that the report was taken and that evidence was collected from multiple locations.

The four-page report is redacted, especially what he appeared to be doing before the incident and what type of gun was used in the shooting.

The report also reveals that the shooting was reporting was first reported by a 72-year-old neighbor, who told the dispatcher he heard a loud bang emanating from Markel's home and then saw a car driving away, 'possibly white or silver'.

The man 'further described the car as being small, clean and possibly a newer model,' the report said. He added the car was a Prius or a Prius-type of vehicle.

Investigators have not speculated on the circumstances of Markel's death in an apparent attempt to withhold information that a guilty party would incriminate themselves with in the event of an arrest.

Indeed, on Wednesday, the police in Florida's state capital released an image of a Toyota Prius and declared it a 'vehicle of interest'.

And on Thursday it was announced that friends, colleagues and members of the public have managed to raise almost $50,000 in just three days for a prominent Harvard and Cambridge educated criminal law professor who was gunned down in his own home last Friday.

So far, police appear to at a loss as to who was responsible for shooting 41-year-old Professor Dan Markel in the head at his affluent Betton Hills home in Florida last week.

Tallahassee police say it is likely the Florida State University professor knew his killer because there were no signs of forced entry.

The shooting of the popular lawyer has stunned friends, colleagues and residents of his well-to-do community in Florida's state capital.

A fund was set up at the start of the week to benefit his sons Benjamin Amichai Markel and Lincoln Jonah Markel.

Those close to him have spoken of how he loved his students, his colleagues, his friends, his scholarly work, and helping all those in need.

'Most of all, he loved his faith and his family. Ben and Lincoln were his heart. Danny will live every day in our hearts, and we must work together to ensure his most beloved little bears know how much their Abba was loved and what a great, wise, amazing man and father he was...and how much he loved them,' the site states.

Intentional? Police are investigating the 
possibility that Dan Markel was the subject of a targeted killing inside
 his Tallahassee home on Friday morning

As the investigation gathers pace, police have not ruled out a contract killing and have issued a picture of a white Toyota Prius that was seen close to the crime scene.

'There’s not enough information to suggest that this is a contract murder. It certainly could be,' said ABC News consultant Brad Garrett, a former FBI agent.

'The most likely theory is that it it’s somebody that he knows.'

However, with no suspects being named, the police are being careful not to reveal crucial evidence that they are hopeful the murderer will volunteer and incriminate themselves.

'We must make sure that we are keeping the integrity of this case so we can bring it to prosecution,' Northway said.

Markel, 41, who is divorced from the mother of his two children, a day after the attack in his upscale Tallahassee neighborhood, as police revealed there were no signs of burglary or robbery and police have admitted they have no suspects so far.

'This is a puzzle and we need to get all of the pieces of the puzzle put together to bring this case to a close,' said Officer David Northway.

Officers were first called to Markel's home at 11am last Friday after a neighbor reported hearing a loud bang coming from his home.

He was found with a gunshot wound to his head, but died later in hospital from his injuries.

'It was not a robbery,' Northway said. 'It does not appear that it was a burglary. At this time, it does appear that Mr. Markel was unfortunately the intended victim in this case.'

Markel was known as a strict disciplinary at Florida State University where he taught law and was known across the country for his writing featured in the New York Times and the Atlantic.

Markel, a Toronto native, had just published a theory of retributive justice in the United States that applied elements of mercy, capital punishment, damages and shaming.

He was the co-author of the book, 'Privilege or Punish: Criminal Justice and the Challenge of Family Ties' and he founded the popular law website, PrawfsBlawg.

His friend and colleague, Stepehen Valdeck of the American University said that Markel's 'devotion to scholarly enterprise' was his key.

Vladeck said that 'Dan was  brilliant scholar and writer, but there are lots of law professors who fit those labels,' Vladeck wrote in an email to FoxNews.com.

'Whether that meant tirelessly reading and providing feedback on his friends' paper, organizing conferences where folks could present their ideas, or starting a blog where folks looking for an outlet could find a forum to develop and distribute their ideas, Dan cared about legal ideas, as such — even those that weren't his own.'

Markel's own attorney said that it is physically beyond him to imagine how this has happened.

'He’s … by all accounts one of the most dedicated fathers anybody has ever known. And for this to happen to him, it’s just beyond repugnant,' said Stephen Webster, Professor Markel’s lawyer to The Globe and Mail.

And the respected scholar's friends were equally distraught.

'It doesn’t make sense on any level. But at least the initial theory was that it was some kind of robbery gone wrong, which is awful, but at least makes sense,' said Michael McCann, a friend who teaches law at the University of New Hampshire.

'This has become a story that no longer makes sense. If, in fact, he was somehow targeted, I literally just cannot understand that.'
