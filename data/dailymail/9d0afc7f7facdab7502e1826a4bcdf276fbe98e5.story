Hundreds of thousands of jubilant fans thronged the streets of Berlin to celebrate Germany's victory over Argentina in the World Cup final on Sunday night.

The enormous crowd went wild when Mario Gotze scored the winning goal in the 113th minute at the Maracana Stadium in Rio de Janeiro, sealing Germany's fourth World Cup triumph.

Fans had started gathering on a 'Fan Mile' underneath the Brandenburg Gate many hours before kick-off to watch the match on giant television screens, with an estimated 200,000 present and ready to party by the end of the night.

Fireworks illuminated the skies above the German capital a the final whistle as fans set off smoke flares and waved flags to mark a memorable triumph.

Following the previous disappointments of finishing runners-up to Brazil in the 2002 World Cup final and Spain in the 2008 European Championship final, Germany became the first European side to win the biggest prize on South American soil.

They were, by popular consensus, the best team on show in Brazil and sent shockwaves through world football with their astonishing 7-1 rout of the hosts in the semi-final.

Chancellor Angela Merkel was present at the Maracana to see the team crowned champions and she embraced each of the players in turn as they walked up to collect their medals.

It is the first triumph by a unified Germany, following on from West Germany's wins in 1954, 1974 and 1990.

After a tense and often tempestuous match, the winning moment came with seven minutes of extra time remaining. Chesting down a cross from Andre Schurrle, Gotze volleyed the ball across goalkeeper Sergio Romero and into the far corner of the net.

It was a different story in Argentina, however, as the thousands gathered in the capital Buenos Aires and other towns and cities came to terms with the fact their team would not be lifting the World Cup in the backyard of rivals Brazil.

Argentina were left to rue a series of missed opportunities, notably when Gonzalo Higuain dragged a shot wide in the first-half and talisman Lionel Messi curled an effort wide early in the second.

Higuain also saw a goal correctly flagged for offside when he converted Ezequiel Lavezzi's cross.

It was hardly the send-off coach Alejandro Sabella had hoped for in his final match at the helm of the national team.

Hundreds of thousands of Argentina fans had descended on Rio in hope rather than expectation of getting a ticket, with most just wanting to be present in the city where their team were crowned the best team in the world.

With flights fully booked, many had made the journey to Rio by road in mobile homes and battered cars, taking as much as two days to reach their destination.

Thousands of supporters of both stripes were on the famous Copacabana Beach, watching events unfold on a big screen.
