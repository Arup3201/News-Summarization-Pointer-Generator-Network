New England quarterback Tom Brady is battling a cold - but Richard Sherman laughed off his opponent's ailment ahead of Sunday's Super Bowl.

Ahead of his record sixth Super Bowl, Brady sniffed his way through 45 minutes of his media session, saying: 'I've had it for four to five days, my kids got sick and my wife's pretty sick right now,' the said. 'I brought it, unfortunately, to Phoenix, but I'll be fine. I'll be good.'

Sherman, Seattle's shutdown corner who launched his infamous 'You mad, bro?' tirade at Brady following the Seahawks' 24-23 victory in 2012, quipped: 'His arm doesn't have a cold' when told.

The Patriots practised for the first time in Phoenix on Wednesday, with Brady admitting that he has spent many hours studying Seattle's top ranked defense.

'Most of the plan is in, now it's about refining it. There are only 65 plays left in the season, or 70 plays left in the season, so every play that you call is paramount. We have to make sure we're dialed in and every play we call, we have a chance for success.

Brady remains focused on unravelling the Seatlle defense despite battling a cold

'I've watched more film than I think I've ever watched in my life.

'I feel like I know these guys pretty well, I know how they play. I have a lot of respect for the way they play. They have good players and a great scheme, and they have very good coaching. You can see everything is very well-coordinated with this team, and they all have responsibilities and they do a great job and are very disciplined in doing it.

'We're pretty disciplined, too, so it's going to be a test of wills to see who will break down first. I certainly hope it's them, not us. But that's what makes for a defense.'
