A hospital trust has lost the personal data of tens of thousands of patients who were treated by paramedics.

Around 42,000 electronic copies of handwritten patient notes have gone missing at the East Midlands Ambulance Service (EMAS) NHS Trust headquarters in Beechdale, Nottingham.

It is believed the data contained patient report forms of those treated by EMAS paramedics from September 2012 and November 2012.

Chief Executive Sue Noyes has apologised for the 'extremely unfortunate' incident and said there is a possibility that the data cartridge could still be in the building.

She believes the data can only be read using specific hardware at the site, which is no longer being made.

She added that the incident had been referred to the Information Commissioner's Office, an independent body which monitors data safety.

She said: 'We take our responsibility for the security and confidentiality of the information we record and store very seriously, and express sincere apologies for a patient data loss incident which we have reported to the Information Commissioner this week.

'We are certain the data can only be read via specific hardware which we have in our premises, and which is no longer in production i.e. it is obsolete.

'Therefore it is unlikely that the information stored on the missing cartridge can be viewed by anyone outside of the organisation.'

It is believed the data, stored at the trust's headquarters in Beechdale, Nottingham, contained patient report forms of those treated by EMAS paramedics from September 2012 to November 2012

EMAS said it has already launched its own internal investigation into how the data went missing.

The ambulance service was criticised last month after its latest response figures showed ambulances failed to reach some of the most seriously ill patients on time.

Paramedics should strive to get to at least three quarters of the most critical cases within eight minutes, but EMAS only reached 71.3 per cent of these patients on time in 2013/14.

Any patients with concerns about the lost data can contact the ambulance service on 0115 8845055.
