After 20 years, iconic singer David Bowie is on top of the album charts again after The Next Day, his first new material in nearly a decade, has gone straight to Number One.

That makes it the 66-year-old singer's first chart-topper since 1993's Black Tie White Noise, the Official Charts Company said.

Comeback: The Next Day, Bowie's first new material in nearly a decade, went straight to number one

Bowie's success marks a remarkable comeback for a star who emerged in the late 1960s.

An
exhibition of his outlandish stage costumes has sold out at the 
Victoria and Albert Museum. Demand for tickets to David Bowie Is, which 
opens this week, has broken all previous records.

More than 42,000 tickets for the retrospective have been sold, more than double the advance sales of previous exhibitions.

In January, a track from his new album issued with a mysterious video became the most downloaded song on iTunes.

Bowie
returned to the top of the British album charts with a collection of 
new recordings acclaimed by one critic as the greatest comeback in 
rock'n'roll history.

The Next 
Day, recorded in secret over two years, shot straight to number one in 
its first week on release, shifting over 94,000 copies to become the 
fastest-selling album of 2013, the Official Charts Company said.

Bowie
surprised fans and the music industry in January with the unexpected 
release of the single Where Are We Now? on his 66th birthday and the 
announcement that an album of fresh recordings would be issued in March.

He had shunned the limelight since suffering a heart attack on tour in 2004 and last performed on stage since 2006.

Produced
by his long-time collaborator Tony Visconti, critics
have showered praise on the album, which topped digital iTunes charts 
in 40 countries in the days after its release on March 8, according to 
Bowie's official website.

The question will now be how the recording fares in the United States, where Bowie has never had a number one album.

American sales data from Billboard will show on Wednesday whether Bowie has outsold What About Now, a rival new release from U.S. rockers Bon Jovi, beaten into second place in the British charts.

Emeli Sande's Our Version Of Events 
slipped one place to Number Three, while last week's chart-toppers 
Bastille fell three places to Number Four with Bad Blood.

In the singles chart, Justin Timberlake claimed a third week at the top with Mirrors.

One Direction's Comic Relief single One Way Or Another (Teenage Kicks) is up four places to Number Two.
