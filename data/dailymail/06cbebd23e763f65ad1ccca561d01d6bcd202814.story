Power firms will be forced to 'come clean' about their costs and the profits that they make under reforms designed to drive down bills, Nick Clegg said today.

The Deputy Prime Minister revealed government plans to impose 'total transparency’ on competition among the Big Six companies, which account for 99 per cent of UK homes.

It will also be made easier and quicker for people to switch between energy suppliers, with ministers hoping firms will have to offer better deals to attract and retain customers.

Warning: Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said the Big Six energy firms had to open up their books to scrutiny

Households will be promised clearer bills while the government carries out an annual review of competition in the sector.

Pressure has grown in the government to act as the latest round of pre-winter price hikes got under way.

Mr Clegg called on the firms to ‘come clean’ about how they were passing on the costs to customers.

‘I would say to the Big Six that it's 
time that they opened their books, it's time that they were straight 
with people, it's time that they levelled with their customers,’ he 
added.

David Cameron also told MPs today: ‘What we need in the energy market is more competition and lower levies and charges to drive profits and prices down.’

Review: Energy Secretary Ed Davey will set out plans for an annual competition review in a statement to the Commons tomorrow

Four of the Big Six firms have already announced big price rises, with ScottishPower bills going up by 9 per cent, Npower announced a 10.4 per cent price hike, British Gas a 9.2 per cent rise and Scottish & Southern Energy an 8.2 per cent increase.

E.ON boss Tony Cocker today hinted that its prices will also rise, warning: ‘Fundamentally things in the energy mix keep driving costs up.'

Critics accuse the big firms of behaving like a monopoly, all putting their prices up at the same time by the same amount.

Tomorrow Energy Secretary Ed Davey will use a statement to the Commons to set out plans for the annual review of competition.

If it is found to be not working, the government could intervene to make it easier for smaller rivals to get a foothold in the market.

He will also promise to force companies to make their bills clearer, so customers can understand how much energy they use and what they are being charged for.

Ministers also want to make it easier for customers to switch between firms, copying reforms agreed with the banking industry which allows people to change current accounts within seven days.

However there is no coalition agreement on the future of green levies, which David Cameron has vowed to ‘roll back’.

Mr Clegg has suggested that some charges on bills used for environmental schemes or those helping the vulnerable to stay warm could be paid for out of general taxation.

But Tory energy minister Michael Fallon today insisted this was just ‘one idea’ being considered and there was no ‘specific target’ for how much the Government hoped to reduce the levies by.

The price hikes will add £50 to every family's bill with some households seeing annual rises of more than £100

Companies have estimated that bills could be cut by around £60 if the green taxes were scrapped.

But Mr Cocker, chief executive of E.ON, today he has not ‘done the arithmetic to see what the total picture is’.

Mr Clegg said discussions with the Prime Minister over green levies would continue until December.

He
told reporters at his monthly press conference: ‘I certainly don't want
to throw the poorest in this land to the wolves by some hasty, 
ill-thought through change.

Energy firm Npower has already unveiled plans for clearer bills so customers can more easily see what gas and electricity they have used

‘I also want to protect the thousands of jobs in the booming green energy sector and I want to ensure that the investment flows into our energy infrastructure so we continue to create those jobs but also keep the lights on in the future and we don't turn our back on the environment.

‘Those are the objectives, those are the ends that I think we should absolutely stick to but of course I'm very pragmatic about making sure that, if we can deliver those ends through means which are less costly, then of course we should look at that.’

The Deputy Prime Minister attacked the energy companies, claiming it was ‘totally implausible’ that bill hikes were being caused by green levies, and adding that the proportion it accounted for in terms of costs was unchanged from last year.

Jonathan Reynolds, Labour's shadow energy minister, said: 'Hard-pressed energy customers struggling with the cost of living need action now, not the promise of another review in future led by the same regulator that has let the energy companies get away with ripping people off.

'Nothing less than a price freeze will do, because this is the only way we can deal with the energy companies overcharging.

'Labour's energy freeze will save money for 27 million households and 2.4 million businesses and our plans to reset the market will deliver fairer prices in the future. People are sick and tired of paying over the odds because David Cameron is too weak to stand up to the energy companies.'
