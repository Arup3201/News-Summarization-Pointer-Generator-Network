Brown Ideye’s proposed move to Qatar club Al Gharafa has taken an intriguing twist with West Bromwich Albion now willing to lower their demands for the striker from £6million to an initial €5million – around £3.8million.

Negotiations are ongoing and they suggest frantic work is taking place to recoup cash for a fresh face at centre-forward. 

A short-term package of greater expense than chairman Jeremy Peace would usually countenance could be put together for the right player – given the huge financial reward of staying in the Premier League.

Albion paid a club record £10m for Ideye from Dinamo Kiev but were discussing a transfer with Qatari club, Al Gharafa, on Sunday night.

Manager Tony Pulis made enquiries for West Ham striker Carlton Cole as he laid the groundwork for Ideye's departure.

West Ham, however, are reluctant to let Cole go without having a replacement. Andy Carroll also picked up an injury in Saturday's defeat to Liverpool. Rickie Lambert of Liverpool remains an alternative option for Albion.

Burnley made a £2million offer for Albion's Scotland international Graham Dorrans with a deal possibly rising to £4m on Burnley staying up.

The Baggies are still in discussions to sign Manchester United midfielder Darren Fletcher

Albion boss Pulis is continuing discussions over a move for Darren Fletcher of Manchester United and has Tottenham's Etienne Capoue as an alternative loan target.

Pulis also wants a winger and is keen on Swansea left-back Neil Taylor and Swansea will look to replace him with Norwich's Martin Olsson if they can agree on a £5m fee.

West Ham, wary of late interest in Winston Reid from Tottenham and Arsenal, have made enquiries for Dnipro's Czech Republic defender Ondrej Mazuch. Tottenham have not made Reid an offer.
