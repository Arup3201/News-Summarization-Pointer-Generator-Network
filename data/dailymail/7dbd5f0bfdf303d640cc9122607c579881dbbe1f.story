David Cameron is likely to come under pressure after he committed to increasing the aid budget despite the money doing little to increase freedoms

Fast-rising aid spending has done nothing to help the economic and political freedoms of people in the countries which benefit, a new analysis found yesterday.

It examined the progress of 28 countries which have had a share of the aid financed by British taxpayers and found that the money ‘does not have any discernible impact on freedom in developing countries’.

It found that twice as many countries lost freedoms after receiving British aid than improved the political and human rights conditions for their citizens.

The report produced by the TaxPayers’ Alliance said: ‘Our current approach to development is not delivering the progress many hoped.’

The findings are likely to deepen suspicion of aid spending among Tory right-wingers who are unconvinced by David Cameron’s commitment to increasing the aid budget to 0.7 per cent of gross national income. 

The pledge pushed aid spending close to £12billion last year and means further sharp increases over the next few years.

The Prime Minister has given his personal support to a LibDem-backed private member’s bill which would write the 0.7 per cent target into law – a decision which means Mr Cameron faces the prospect of seeing many of his backbenchers vote against him.

The new report measured the impact of aid spending against benchmarks laid down by international organisations. 

These included the World Bank, which assesses how firms are bound by red tape; the Heritage Foundation, which published a measure of trade and property freedom; Freedom in the World, which measures political and civil liberties, and various groups which assess internet and press freedom.

Among 28 countries which received British aid, 12 showed no effective change at all in their measured levels of freedom over a decade.

Six had a falling score while just three – Nepal, Rwanda and Tanzania – had freedom levels that improved with increasing aid.

Among the 28 countries to receive British aid,12 showed no effective change on human rights and political freedoms, while six went backwards

Four countries – Ghana, Paraguay, Peru and Zambia – had improved freedom scores even though the amount of aid they received from Britain went down.

Russia, which ceased to get UK aid in 2011, had a falling score. Ukraine’s share of British aid money went down, and its measured levels of freedom remained little changed.

The report said: ‘Emergency aid can help prevent famine and limit the spread of disease. 

'Health programmes can ensure millions of children in the developing world are vaccinated against serious illness. 

'But the impact of other aid spending, on things like education, infrastructure, governance, capacity building and more, is much harder to measure.’

It warned that the amount of money that is spent on aid should not be confused with the effectiveness of the aid programme.

‘While international structures and organisations are critical in the global effort to tackle poverty, the iron triangle between the Department for International Development, recipient governments and non-governmental organisations must not push donor governments into believing that financial inputs are more important than actual outcomes,’ the report said.

A spokesman for the Department for International Development said: ‘Britain’s aid budget is focused on helping developing countries become self-sufficient, stopping the spread of disease and supporting civilians through war and famine.

‘But in addition to bearing down on poverty and instability, Britain promotes freedom by backing fair elections, a free press and individual rights, and we should be proud of that.’

Jonathan Isaby, Chief Executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘With Britain’s public finances in such a horrendous state, it’s crucial that foreign aid delivers results. 

'Too often, British taxpayers’ money is spent propping up governments that refuse to grant fundamental freedoms.

‘The arbitrary spending target of 0.7 per cent so loved by politicians means that money is spent for the sake of it, rather than for any obvious need. 

'Every penny of foreign aid should have one goal - making the lives of ordinary people in developing countries better. If it isn’t doing that, it should be stopped.’

David Cameron pledged to increase aid spending sharply in coming years

But report shows it does not encourage political or human freedom

In fact six countries given British aid went back on human rights' promises
