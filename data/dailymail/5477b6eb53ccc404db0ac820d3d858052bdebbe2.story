An avid horse rider is back in the saddle - after reining in her weight problem and shedding seven stone in 16 months.

Claire Magill, 44, from Ipswich, Suffolk, was forced to give up her passion for riding when she piled on the pounds after the birth of son Joseph, now 9.

She hit 20st at her heaviest, making her too big for most horses, and had to sell her beloved own mount, called B.

She was shocked into action when she struggled to complete a three-mile walk after climbing Cheddar Gorge on a family holiday in Somerset in 2013.

When they returned home, she saw an advert for a holiday where people could go horse riding.

She kept it as inspiration and started a strict calorie-controlled diet - losing seven stone in 16 months to drop to 12st 4lb.

Last year she went on holiday and mounted a horse for the first time in nine years and can now fit into a pair of size 12 jodhpurs.

In December Claire bought her own horse again - nine-year-old warmblood West - which she keeps at a local stables

And in December she bought her own horse again - a nine-year-old warmblood called West - which she keeps in a stable near her home in Ipswich, Suffolk.

Claire, a part-time accounts manager, said: 'I’ve had horses on and off since I was 13, but I just couldn’t cope looking after him when I had Joseph.

'Then as the weight crept on I just felt I was too overweight to actually ride a horse.

'After we got back from that awful holiday I saw that picture and just though I want to do that again - and decided that I would lose the weight so I could horse ride again.'

Claire, married to husband John, 49, joined her local Slimming World group when she was 19st 7lb.

She added: 'When we went on holiday in 2013 I just felt horrible about myself, and I don’t think it was much fun for my husband and son either.

'I just felt so low about myself, I couldn’t manage to go on walks with them and I had hardly any clothes because nothing fitted.

'It just hit me how unhealthy I was. As soon as I got back I went on the diet and I looked at the photo every day to spur me on.

'I’m so happy to have my own horse again and be able to go horse-riding, I just love it, you feel so free.'
