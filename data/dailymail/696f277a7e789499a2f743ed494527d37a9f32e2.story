A lorry driver who killed a young girl in a horrific motorway crash after ignoring speed limit signs has been jailed for four-and-a-half years today.

Robert Booth, 64, pleaded guilty this month to causing the death of four-year-old Priyanka Bhogal by dangerous driving despite initially denying the offence.

Priyanka, from Coventry, died of a head injury after Booth’s heavy goods vehicle smashed into the back of her mother’s Vauxhall Zafira on the M6 in November 2011.

Robert Booth (right) was jailed for four and a half years after his HGV ploughed into the back of a family car killing Priyanka Bhogal (left), four. He had ignored overhead warning signs to slow down on the M6

Signs leading up to the site of the accident near Coleshill, Warwickshire, had reduced the speed limit to 40mph and even 20mph because of slow-moving traffic.

But Booth’s lorry was later found to 
have been travelling at its 'limited' top speed of around 55mph until 
moments before it came to a halt.

Sentencing Booth, of Town End Farm, 
Sunderland, Judge Sylvia De Bertodano accepted he had led an 'entirely 
blameless' life before to the tragedy.

Warwick Crown Court heard Booth, a 
married father-of-four, was of previous good character and had received 
'not so much as a speeding conviction' while working as a lorry driver 
for 42 years.

Booth, who has eight grandchildren, 
had also developed a depressive illness since the accident, as well as 
suffering from a heart condition and caring for his wife.

During her sentencing remarks, Judge 
De Bertodano told Booth: 'Nothing in your past can possibly have 
prepared you for finding yourself in the position that you are in today.

'I have no doubt about your remorse 
but nothing you can do, and nothing that I can do, can take away the 
pain that Priyanka’s family suffer and will continue to suffer for the 
rest of their lives.'

Seven other people were also injured in the crash between Junctions 4a and 4 of the southbound M6 at 12:25am on November 27, 2011- which saw the motorway closed for more than six hours (file picture)

Imposing a five-year driving ban, the 
judge told Booth: 'It was a sustained period of driving for what must 
have been several minutes, during which you ignored the traffic signs 
which clearly reduced the advisory speed limit to 40mph and then made 
that limit mandatory.

'You also ignored the fact that vehicles ahead were slowing down - the red brake lights described by other drivers.

'Despite all this you maintained a 
speed limit at the top level available to your vehicle. Whether asleep 
or awake you were in your own little world and utterly unaware of what 
was going on outside your cab.'

Two other members of Priyanka’s 
family, including her aunt and eight-year-old sister, suffered serious 
injuries when the near-stationary Zafira was 'punted' into a concrete 
barrier at about 12.25am.

Priyanka was sitting in the rearmost near side seat and was sitting on a booster seat. 

The Bhogal family had 
been driving home to Coventry after a family member's 40th birthday 
party the previous day in Walsall, West Midlands.

The car, which had slowed down with 
its hazard lights flashing, was struck despite 'obvious' overhead gantry
signs warning of a problem ahead.

Booth pleaded guilty on the second day
of a trial at which he claimed he may have fallen asleep due to 
obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome, rather than tiredness, in the run-up 
to the crash.

Priyanka's family said after the trial at Warwick Crown Court (pictured) that Booth's sentence is 'nothing compared to the sentence which we will face for the rest of our lives'

Following the sentencing, Priyanka’s 
relatives released a statement on what they said was 'another milestone 
in this dark chapter of our lives'.

The statement, released through West 
Midlands Police, read: 'We have had to wait and suffer to see justice 
done for over a year, on top of coming to terms of the loss of our 
daughter Priyanka under such tragic circumstances.

'The sentence Mr Booth has been given 
is nothing compared to the sentence which we will face for the rest of 
our lives. There will never be a day when we won’t remember the warmth 
and love we received from our daughter and the pain we feel from losing 
her.'

The family added that the aborted 
trial had been 'emotionally and physically draining' and had forced them
to relive the horrific and painful events of November 27, 2011.

The statement continued: 'We often ask
ourselves how we would act had we killed a four-year-old child as a 
result of driving dangerously.

'We can honestly say that we would come forward and take responsibility for our mistake.

'We would want the family to know how 
genuinely sorry we were and do everything possible not to cause them any
further pain or suffering.

'It’s very difficult for us to forgive
someone whose actions since that night have demonstrated no genuine 
remorse or regret and have been designed only to try and escape 
justice.'

Seven other people were also injured 
in the crash between Junctions 4a and 4 of the southbound M6, which saw 
the motorway closed for more than six hours.
