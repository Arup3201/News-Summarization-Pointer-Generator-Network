A jealous and enraged Florida teen strangled his love rival in just 13 minutes in a Wal-Mart parking lot before burying the body in a nearby forest, a jury heard in the opening statements of the now-20-year-old's murder trial Tuesday.

Pedro Bravo had become obsessed that Christian Aguilar, a University of Florida student, was dating his high school girlfriend, Erika Friman, and plotted to eliminate him, Assistant State Attorney Brian Kramer said.

'This is a story as old as time - elimination of a rival fueled by jealousy and anger,' Kramer said.

Aguilar's body was discovered several weeks later by hunters in forest off State Road 24 near Cedar Key in Levy County.

Bravo is also on trial for kidnapping and other charges in the September 20, 2012, death of a man who once was his high school friend.

Kramer showed a photo of Bravo and Aguilar as high school pals in Miami and surveillance photos of them buying a Kanye West CD at Best Buy in Gainesville, according to Gainsville.com.

But he also showed gruesome pictures of Aguilar's skeletal remains to the courtroom, and Bravo didn't react.

Other surveillance pictures showed Bravo buying a shovel, drugs, duct tape, a knife and other items from Lowe's and Wal-Mart that were used in the alleged killing.

The prosecution's case leans on Bravo's journal and sketchbook, in which he detailed his bubbling resentment regarding his and Friman's break up and the fact she had began to date Aguilar.

'His plan is to get her back,' Kramer said of Bravo. 'He's got to reunite with Erika.'

In preparation for the murder, Kramer said, Bravo searched the internet for information on murder, anesthetics and cutting veins, and then on the fateful day he lured Aguilar to his car and then suffocated him using possibly a belt around his neck in the back seat.

'He cuts off the air to his airway and blood to his brain,' Kramer said. 'He would later (tell someone) it took Christian 13 minutes to die.'

Friman and Bravo were dating at high school in Miami but Friman ended things before leaving to Gainsville to attend Santa Fe College, where Bravo later followed.

Friman reported that Aguilar was missing when he failed to meet her as planned on September 20.

Friman is expected to take the stand in the trial, which is due to run through next week.
