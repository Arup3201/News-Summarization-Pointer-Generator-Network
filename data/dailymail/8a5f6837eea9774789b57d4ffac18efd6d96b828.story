British public life is dominated by a privileged private school elite, Education Secretary Michael Gove admitted yesterday.

He said former prime minister Sir John Major was right to speak out about the ‘shocking’ domination of a small elite.

Sir John’s intervention this week made uncomfortable reading for David Cameron, who attended Eton and whose Cabinet is dominated by former public schoolboys.

Downing Street said the Prime Minister believed ‘what counts is not where you come from but where you are going’.

Agreement: Michael Gove said it was an 'inescapable fact' that Sir John Major was right about the dominance of a privileged private school elite

Sir John has increased his public profile in recent weeks, demanding a windfall tax on energy companies, urging action to help the 'silent have-nots' and warning about a lack of social mobility.

His latest remarks were seen as a thinly-veiled reference to the wealthy
 backgrounds of David Cameron's government, in contrast to Sir John's 
own upbringing in a rented flat in Brixton, South London.

During a speech to the South Norfolk Conservative Association on Friday evening, Sir John said: ‘In every single sphere of
 British influence, the upper echelons of power in 2013 are held 
overwhelmingly by the privately educated or the affluent middle class.

‘To me, from my background, I find that truly shocking.’

Downing
 Street rejected the criticism, insisting policies to help people get on
 were more important than the background of politicians.

But Mr Gove, who was adopted at just four months, insisted Sir John was 'right'.

He told BBC Radio 4: 'It’s an inescapable fact. And that’s one of the reasons why both I was speaking today about social work and the vital need to make sure that vulnerable children don’t suffer from neglect and don’t have their futures blighted.

'It’s also why we’re reforming the schools system so that the opportunities that wealthy children have are more equally spread.

'As the Prime Minister said, he’s in business, in politics to spread great education, to make opportunity more equal and that’s what’s happening.'

Mr Cameron, who went to Eton, is vulnerable to charges that his Cabinet is dominated by a privileged elite.

And some wavering Tories believe he should change tack and bring back grammar schools to help poorer children.

But Mr Cameron’s spokesman said yesterday: ‘At the heart of this is the importance of building what the Prime Minister has described as an aspiration nation. He has said what counts is not where you come from but where you are going.

‘That’s why we have put education reform and welfare reform at the heart of Government policy.

‘I actually think that what people around
 their breakfast table in the morning, getting their kids ready for 
school… what they want to know is the government has the policies to 
ensure that their kids can fulfil their talents and ambitions. That’s 
what is the most important thing.’

It is the second time in a month that Sir John has spoken out about the dangers of out-of-touch well-heeled politicians indifferent to the needs of the poor.

Embarrassing: Both the current Conservative 
Prime Minister, David Cameron, left, and his Liberal Democrat Deputy 
Prime Minister, Nick Clegg, right, as well as senior members of the 
cabinet, were privately schooled

Sir John blamed Labour for the ‘collapse in social mobility’ and the ‘truly shocking’ inequality in the UK.

He criticised Ed Miliband's ‘absurd mantra to be the one-nation party’, suggesting that ‘they left a Victorian divide between stagnation and aspiration’.

The 70-year-old grew up in a rented flat in Brixton and was educated in a comprehensive school where he attained three O-levels.

Despite his direct criticism of Labour policies during the speech at South Norfolk Conservative Association’s annual dinner, his comments are also likely to prove embarrassing for David Cameron.

The Prime Minister was educated at Eton and went on to study at Oxford University.

Several senior members of the Cabinet, including Chancellor George Osborne and Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg, were privately educated, as was London Mayor Boris Johnson.

Sir John suggested that British institutions should return to a system whereby ‘sheer hard graft’ can lead to success, rather than having to rely on privilege.

He said: ‘I remember enough of my past to be outraged on behalf of the people abandoned when social mobility is lost.

'Our education system should help children out of the circumstances in which they were born, not lock them into the circumstances in which they were born.

‘We need them to fly as high as their luck, their ability and their sheer hard graft can actually take them. And it isn’t going to happen magically.’
