A bar has been forced to close after hosting a naked game night where people played strip Twister, according to the owner.

The League Brewpub, storefront of the Brewery Incubator, Houston, was handed an eviction notice earlier this month following a complaint from someone who witnessed the nude game.

Owner Lucrece Borrego claims that naked game nights are now taking place regularly across the Texas city and says that all the windows were covered during the private party.

A complaint was made after someone witnessed a game of strip Twister at the Houston brewpub

She said: 'Indeed, I had agreed to host a naked game night, a completely private event that takes place at bars all over Houston regularly.

'We covered all the windows and had someone working the door. Only one thing went wrong, an employee of the architectural services firm next door that has access to our hallways was working long after business hours and stumbled up a game of strip Twister in the hall.

'Whoever this person was, he or she had clearly never seen the naked male body before and took great offence to the incident, crying 'public nudity' to the landlord.

'Never would a game of strip Twister be so badly regretted.'

The brewery collective was given just five days notice to vacate the premises following the 'public nudity' incident, as Ms Borrego was unable to pay legal fees to fight the case.

Twister is a classic children's game played on a plastic mat where people follow instructions and place either their hands or feet on different colours

She said: 'The notice seemed like a joke. They claimed rent had been late, but still, they acknowledged it was received and I could prove it was mailed in time.

'They cited 'misuse' of the premises as the reason. Lumped together these are kegs in the hallway in between deliveries and pick-up and the clincher, a game of strip Twister.

'The notice even cited my Facebook event share post 'condoning' the naked games.

'I was certain that I could fight this. After all, I have a commercial lease. How can they just kick me out with five days notice?

'I immersed myself in internet research and frantically met with lawyers, learning my rights and the eviction procedures. 

'They assured me I could fight this and win, but said it's going to cost you. And the landlord can keep doing it again and again until you're out. And he wants you out.

'Essentially, I was faced with an indefinite expensive legal battle, or to abandon my life savings and dream. I'm not sure if that's a decision anyone can really make. I can't afford the legal battle. The decision was made for me. It's that simple.'

The bar hosted an eviction party and any proceeds will be used to fight the legal battle.

Brewery Incubator, a collective that helps new brewers test the waters of going commercial, officially launched in 2012 following a successful Kickstarter campaign.
