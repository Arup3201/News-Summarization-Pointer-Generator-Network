Accused: Andrei Lugovoi takes the polygraph test

The prime suspect in the murder of Alexander Litvinenko will ask a British judge to allow lie-detector evidence to be admitted at the inquest into the death of the Russian dissident.

Andrei Lugovoi, who is accused of poisoning Mr Litvinenko with radioactive polonium-210  at a London hotel in 2006, says the results of  the polygraph test he took in Russia earlier this year prove he was not involved.

The Crown Prosecution Service has named Mr Lugovoi as the prime suspect in the case and is seeking his extradition to the UK to face trial.

But the former Russian intelligence officer has refused to surrender himself to British justice and has agreed only to provide video evidence to the inquest next year.

He has asked his lawyers to challenge 
rules which prevent  lie-detector evidence being admitted in court 
because it is considered unreliable.

Poisoned: Alexander Litvinenko at London's University College Hospital shortly before his death in 2006

Lugovoi said charges against him were part of a smear campaign by Kremlin foes and British secret services aimed at discrediting Russia

He has also contacted polygrapher Brian Burgess, who carried out the lie-detector test on Mr Lugovoi for a media company, to ask  him to testify.

Mr Burgess said: ‘In the test  I asked him three questions about his alleged involvement in the murder of Mr Litvinenko and whether he had ever handled polonium.  His answers showed that he was telling truth.’

However, Alex Goldfarb, a friend of  Mr Litvinenko, said: ‘I would not give the  test much credence.’
