The tearful cousin of Glee star Cory Monteith on Sunday placed a bouquet of flowers outside the Vancouver hotel where his relative was found dead the day before.

Richard Monteith sobbed as he added to the small memorial of tributes outside the Fairmont Pacific Rim Hotel, where Corey, 31, tragically passed away of as yet unknown causes while alone in his room.

The final photo of the Canadian-born heart throb also emerged - a picture snapped on Thursday night while he was out with friends and which Corey immediately adopted as his Twitter profile.

The actor - who completed a stint in rehab in April for substance addiction and appeared to be 'happy and healthy' in recent months - was out in Vancouver on Friday before returning alone to his hotel.

The star had been in his luxury hotel 
room with friends before heading out for the night during a visit from Los Angeles. His girlfriend and 
Glee co-star Lea Michele is not believed to have been with him.

No
cause of death has been confirmed at this point but there was said to 
be no implications of foul play. Medical examiners will conduct an 
autopsy on Monday.

His cousin Richard made an emotional appearance outside the hotel on Sunday and left a bouquet of white flowers. Fans had arranged cards, stuffed toys, flowers and other tributes outside the hotel.

Richard struggled with tears and told CTV News: 'He's my cousin, but I would like maybe not to talk right now. A little bit more time, please.'

According to CBC News, the actor's cousin squatted on the ground, with his shoulders shaking, then he wiped his eyes before tucking a card into the bunch of flowers.

Richard told the station that he was 'decently close' to Corey and the pair had met in Vancouver in February.

The final photo of Corey was taken by a friend as he dined in the East Of Main cafe on Thursday night. The actor immediately used the colorful silhouette as his Twitter profile picture.

The restaurant donates all its profits to the Project Limelight society, a free performing arts program for kids living.

On Saturday Project Limelight tweeted: 'The world has lost a truly wonderful young man. We are heartbroken. Our love goes out to Cory Monteith's family, friends and fans.'

Recent pictures of the star showed 
him looking happy and healthy in the company of his long-term girlfriend
after flying into LAX in California.

Cory
last tweeted on Friday, joking around about the new sci-fi film 
Sharknado. He wrote: 'What the c**p is Sharknado... Oh. IT'S A SHARK 
TORNADO.'

Authorities refused to say if there was any connection between Monteith's voluntary stint in rehab and his untimely death, the Toronto Star reported.

They also declined to comment on the contents of the room.

It is believed that the actor had been dead for several hours in his room before his body was found.

He had been due to check out of the luxury hotel on Saturday but when he failed to do so, cleaning staff went to his room where they found his body.

Paramedics were called who declared him dead at the scene shortly after noon. Police said there were no signs of foul play and said that the 31-year-old had died alone.

Video footage has revealed the actor returning to his room by himself after an evening out with friends on Friday.

Monteith had checked into the hotel room on July 6 and was due to check out on Saturday.

The 31-year-old actor, who played 
the character Finn Hudson in the popular Fox show, had spoken publicly about
his battle with addiction.

He had previously received treatment aged 19 and commented that he took 'anything and everything', according to the Vancouver Sun.

His family, who live in Calgary, were notified shortly before police held a press conference over the tragic news.Â

Acting Chief Doug LePard read in a

call from the BC Ambulance Service regarding a sudden death in a room on
the 21st floor of the Fairmont Pacific Rim Hotel at 1038 Canada Place 
in downtown Vancouver.'

Confirming:
'The deceased has been identified as 31-year-old actor Cory Monteith, 
who achieved great fame on the popular TV series Glee.'

Before
giving out further information, LePard said: 'I want to pass on our 
condolences to the family, friends, cast-mates and millions of fans of 
Mr Monteith.'

The actor wrote on his Twitter account that he was listening to the upbeat song 'Paris' by Friendly Fires 'basically on repeat.'

Word had begun to spread on Twitter of
the news late on Saturday night although there was no official comment 
made at that point.

Many believed it to be hoax, as it is not the first time news of his death had spread over the internet.

Tragically, this time the rumours turned out to be true. In a short statement, Cory's publicist Melissa Kates said: 'We are in shock and mourning this tragic loss.'
