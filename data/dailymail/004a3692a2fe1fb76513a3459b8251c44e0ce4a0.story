Great news for Sydney's fashionistas - H&M has announced  they have found the perfect Sydney location for their second store in Australia, which is set to open mid-2015.

The Swedish retail-clothing company exists in 53 countries across the world, and in April this year opened its Australian flagship store in Melbourne, which recorded one of H&M's most successful opening days for a new store,  Sydney Morning Herald reported in April.

Now, Pitt Street's Glasshouse centre in Sydney's CBD will be making room for a 5000 square metre, three-level H&M boutique.

The multi-billion dollar fashion chain said both Australian stores will receive new stock everyday, with plans to extend trading hours in attempt to cash in on passer-bys.

'We deliver the latest fashion but from what I understand the Australian market has been receiving trends one season too late. It has to change; as retailers we have to do better. Especially in a city such as Sydney, which has world-class restaurants, yet the shopping is not up to the same standard,' H&M manager for Australian Hans Andersson recently told Sydney Morning Herald. 

Sydney's H&M boutique will offer their full collection which includes homewares, sportswear, an accessory range and all clothing  for women, men and children.

The western suburbs of Sydney is also set to welcome H&M's much anticipated collaborative collection with American fashion-designer Alexander Wang, to North Ryde's AMP Macquarie Centre on October 16. 

'We will have Alexander Wang in Macquarie and Melbourne, so both stores will have them in store in November, which is something that we don't normally do in suburban stores,' Mr Andersson said. 

The H&M store in Melbourne's historic GPO building apparently saw more than 1.7 million people in less than 20 weeks, and now sees customers  queuing outside the store made for 1200-persons. 

Mr Andersson said Sydney is now the teams focus, which will be drawing on LA marketing and stock due to warmer weather and influence of water. 

But Sydney shoppers are not the only ones that should be excited, with rumours revealing H&M's thoughts to collaborate with a local Australian designer, who is yet to be established, before Sydney's launch.
