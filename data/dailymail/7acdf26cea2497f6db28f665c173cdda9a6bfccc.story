This is the astonishing moment a suspected hit-and-run driver watched passers-by desperately help a man he had knocked down before calmly fleeing the scene.

Brian Day, 48, was allegedly struck by the driver of the silver Toyota Avensis on Upper Brook Street, Manchester city centre, after he stepped out into the road.

The shocking image shows the driver stood idly watching as members of the public help the injured Mr Day just outside the Manchester Royal Infirmary (MRI).

Struck: Police are hunting a driver, circled, who apparently left Brian Day, 48, with 
serious injuries following a hit and run in Manchester city centre earlier this month. The whole incident was captured on CCTV

The driver stopped at the scene - but moments later made off before police arrived.

Mr Day was taken the short distance back to the MRI with a fractured eye socket and damage to his spleen. He has since been discharged.

His wife Tracey Day, 47, from Beswick, Manchester, said Mr Day, an unemployed former Royal Mail worker and father of three, was lucky to survive.

She said: 'I am angry and upset. If that was a child who had been hit they might not have survived.

'I don't understand how they could get out of the car, look at him and get back in the car and drive off and leave him on the floor.

'A few of the doctors told me I am very lucky - I could have been planning his funeral'

The incident happened at around 6pm on Sunday, November 3, but police have not yet tracked down the motorist.

Mr Day had earlier been escorted out of the hospital for being unruly.

Security took Mr Day, who was 'heavily intoxicated', to a bus stop so he could make his way home. Five minutes later he was hit by the car.

Earlier in the day, he had been picked up by an ambulance in Ancoats, Manchester.

Paramedics took him to the MRI but within half an hour of his arrival security had been asked to remove Mr Day for being 'unruly', police have been told.

Mrs Day added: 'I am a bit annoyed. The hospital have just let him go. He was escorted out by three security men.'

Sgt Mark Thomas of GMP said: 'We want to speak to the driver so we can establish the events of that evening, so would urge that he comes forward before we come knocking.

'We would also ask anyone who recognises the man in the image, or if anyone has any knowledge of the driver of the vehicle, described to contact police.'

Anyone with information is asked to call police on 0161 856 4741 or Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
