It has been just three weeks since his daughter Peaches was found dead at her home.

Since then Sir Bob Geldof, 62, has had to endure her heartbreaking funeral while trying to come to terms with the sudden loss.

But just 24 hours before the inquest into the 25-year-old's death begins, he managed to find time to sit down and talk to a friend over a drink.

The former Boomtown Rats singer was seen at the Bluebird pub in Chelsea, London, looking relaxed in the warm weather.

He wore sunglasses and a black leather jacket as he sat back and spoke to his companion.

The pair had a conversation over what appeared to be a collection of paperwork before the unknown friend left in his Bentley.

It has been a devastating three weeks for the Live Aid founder and his family.

But they appeared to receive some good news as reports suggested he proposed to his girlfriend of 18 years, French actress Jeanne Marine.

Her friend Jerry Hall confirmed the news saying: â€˜She
 is over the moon. Jeanne Marine has been a rock and a tower of strength
 over this. Iâ€™m so excited for her I am bursting to tell someone.'

Marine, who turned 49 on Sunday, met 
Geldof at a Paris dinner party, where the singer had fled in a fit of 
depression over his divorce.

He
 enjoyed a brief time out the day before the start of the inquest into 
the TV presenter's death, where a senior police officer confirmed heroin played a role.

Her husband Thomas 
Cohen found her 'slumped' in the spare room on the bed with one leg on 
the floor, and called for his mother before contacting emergency 
services, the hearing was told.

DCI
 Paul Fotheringham said the TV presenter was in contact with her friends
 in the days leading yup to her death, who claimed there was 'no cause 
for concern'.

Geldof has previously paid tribute to his daughter
alongside his partner Jeanne Marine and Ms Geldof's sisters Fifi 
Trixibelle, Pixie and Tiger, saying she was the 'wildest, funniest, 
cleverest, wittiest and the most bonkers of all of us.'
