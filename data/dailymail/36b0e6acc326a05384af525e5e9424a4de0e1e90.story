Former Downing Street spin chief Alastair Campbell has publicly attacked Labour candidates turning down donations from Tony Blair - and warned they should prepare for another Tory government.

Two candidates have already rejected Mr Blair after he offered 106 key battleground seats £1,000 each to fight the election. The former Prime Minister said the swing constituencies were 'where the election will be won for Labour'.

Mr Campbell this morning accused the candidates of being 'attention seeking' and questioned whether they wanted to win.

Writing on Twitter he said: 'To attention seeking candidates rejected TB money 1. He won more Labour seats than anyone 2. Tories are loaded 3. Do you want to win?'

The message sparked an angry backlash from Labour activists who said they were glad candidates were rejecting the money.

But Mr Campbell hit back, warning they should 'enjoy another Tory government then'. 

Mr Campbell's remarks came after Dundee East candidate Lesley Brennan said her constituency would not be accepting the money.

Writing on Twitter she said: 'Received donation from Tony Blair. Instinct was to not accept. Discussed with team. Dundee East is not accepting the £1000.'

Northampton candidate Sally Keeble has also turned down the money. She said: 'The £1,000 donations are being offered to key seats – of which we were one. I have emailed them back to say we won't be accepting.'

When the donation was announced last week a Labour spokesman said the party was 'delighted' that Mr Blair had put his own money behind the effort to get Ed Miliband into Downing Street.

In a letter to the 106 candidates Mr Blair said: 'As the final countdown to the general election begins, I am writing to wish you every success in your efforts to be elected and also to make a donation to your campaign.

'I know how hard it can be to raise money to fund a local campaign, but for you, in one of our 106 battleground seats, it is even more vital.'

He added: 'This is where the election will be won for Labour and that is why I am making a donation to all 106 campaigns.

'As one of our key seat candidates you know better than most the scale of the challenge we face, but I have every confidence that with your drive, determination and organisational skills, you will deliver a successful local campaign that will also see our party returned to government.

'So, good luck and here's to a Labour victory on May 7.'

Mr Blair is in a position to donate £100,000 after making a fortune since leaving Downing Street in 2007.

Leaked documents published yesterday revealed how he proposed a £30million contract to advise the United Arab Emirates while working as the Middle East peace envoy.
