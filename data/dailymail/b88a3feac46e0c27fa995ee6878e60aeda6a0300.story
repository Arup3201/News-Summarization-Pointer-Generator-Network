Toys of characters from Disney's Frozen are selling at a rate of seven a second, figures from eBay reveal.

After parents paid for DVDs, visits to sing-along screenings and specially-themed childrens' parties, youngsters are now pleading for Princess Elsa dolls and other toys linked to the film.

On average, 12,623 Frozen items sell every day via eBay, outstripping all other brands of merchandise.

The Japanese franchise Pokémon is the second most traded brand of toys on the site, followed by Harry Potter in third.

Despite Frozen dominating the market, classic cartoons like Thomas the Tank Engine and Scooby Doo remain in the top 10.

Thomas the Tank Engine  sells nearly 700 items each day via the site, while one piece of Scooby Doo merchandise is sold every hour.

Spokesperson for eBay Laura Wilkinson-Rea said: 'Frozen has really captured the imaginations of an entire generation of children, and is a true phenomenon.

'It will be interesting to see if people are still buying or selling Anna and Elsa dolls in ten, or even 50 years time.'

 The film was released last spring and soon became the highest grossing animation in history

Soaring demand for Frozen merchandise over the last year has seen Disney's revenues grow by 20 per cent

The fact that the Frozen toys are now being widely sold on eBay also suggests that some children's enthusiasm for the film is beginning to flag and unwanted Christmas presents are now being sold on to others.

Frozen is the highest-grossing animation in history, taking more than £700million at the box office after it was released last spring - sparking a series of merchandising spin-offs.

It emerged last week that the parents of two young fans of the film in the US have spent £45,000 turning their youngster's rooms into Frozen-style palaces.

Prime Minister David Cameron told MailOnline last week that his youngest daughter, Florence, is a huge fan.

He said: '(She) has got an Elsa dress with all the trimmings and regularly launches into song.'

The Tory leader admitted he didn't know all the words to film's hit song Let It Go but 'had listened to it being sung more times than I care to remember'.
