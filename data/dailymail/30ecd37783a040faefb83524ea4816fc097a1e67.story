Enner Valencia scored either side of half-time to lift Ecuador back into contention in Group E and see off Honduras.

Carlos Costly had given the Hondurans the lead in Curitiba with his country's first World Cup goal since 1982.

But Valencia responded with a quick equaliser before heading home the winner in the second half.

Host commentator

This match promised little, but delivered a lot. It was certainly entertaining, fast and physical... if not one for the purists.

You can read Craig Hope's take on proceedings with our match report HERE.

Ashley Clements will be here tomorrow for Argentina v Iran at 5pm, and I'll be back for the two late games Germany v Ghana at 8pm and Nigeria v Bosnia at 11pm.

In the meantime, adios.

That is that. Ecuador come from behind to get the three points and rise to second place in Group E ahead of Switzerland on goal difference.

Enner Valencia was the man who made the difference, scoring either side of half-time in Curitiba.

Ecuador play France in their final group game at the Maracana on Wednesday while Honduras must beat Switzerland to stand any chance of progression.

Changes galore as Ecuador throw on Gruezo and the experiences Mendez in an attempt to see this out.

Honduras have brought on Chavez in an attempt to force an equaliser.

Just six minutes to go and I wouldn't bet my house on this finishing 2-1, it's still very open in Curitiba.

Honduras throw on Mario Martinez in an attempt to get back into this game. Garrido is the man who makes way.

A defeat would not be the end of the road for Honduras, but they would need a healthy win over Switzerland and hope France beat Ecuador on Wednesday.

Still 20 minutes to get back into this.

Valencia again! Ecuador lead!

The South Americans come from behind to take the lead in Curitiba.

The warning signs were there for Honduras from a couple of previous crosses into the box. This time, though, another free header for an Ecuador player and Valencia makes no mistake, guiding the ball into the far corner.

It will take a big effort from Honduras now to get back into this.

Another one for Honduras, and again the right decision.

Costly was offside from the ball played through by Espinoza. No vociferous protests this time, though, from Honduras' players.

It was a decent shout for Ecuador, but none of their players really appealed for it.

Caicedo found himself in behind the defence and Figueroa came in at full stretch. The Honduras defender didn't make contact with the ball, and he definitely caught Caicedo.

Corner kick given.

In other news, Antonio Valencia went into the book. That's about all there is to report from a rather poor first 15 minutes in the second half. It's been nothing like the first.

Both managers must have had a word with their teams because the start of the second half has been far more controlled with both teams looking to keep possession.

Ecuador still coming forward and moving the ball fast, but so far Honduras holding firm.

51 mins played - 1-1.

Right, time for the second half in Curitiba.

One change for Honduras as Wigan's Garcia replaces Celtic's Izaguirre.

Well that was a pleasant surprise – end to end, toe to toe, stud to stud, call it what you may, it was entertaining stuff. Honduras have fared better than anticipated and, to give air to one well-worn phrase, this one really could go either way.

A breath-taking first half full of incident in Curitiba.

There has been good football, mistakes, tough challenges, cards and goals... everything we need for an enjoyable game.

Having said that, a draw isn't much good to both teams as it will leave them in 3rd and 4th place respectively in this group.

Still, more of the same in the second half please.

 

Honduras though they were back ahead then. Costly's header came cannoning back off the post to Bengtson, who tapped home from two yards and ran off to celebrate.

The referee's whistle went, though, and the goal was ruled out. It was the right decision, Bengtson handled the ball, and he was offside for good measure.

This has been one of the more enjoyable contests I've seen at this World Cup. You can see the fight in both teams desperate for a win and the energy and physicality has made this a gripping game, as well as the mistakes.

Both goals were quite sloppy from the defending teams, but that's fitting of this game.

Three minutes until half-time.

That didn't last long. A goal from absolutely nothing. Paredes was running with the ball and there seemed to be nothing on. Paredes shot from the edge of the area and it took a deflection before finding Enner Valencia, who had gambled at the far post and earned himself a tap in.

Honduras made a lot of mistakes in the first half hour, but Ayovi makes the most costly one of all and the Hondurans lead.

Ayovi lost the ball just outside his own penalty area, and Carlos Costly picked it up before smashing home low and hard past Dominguez.

Honduras' first World Cup goal since 1982 and they're loving it.

Ecuador slightly on top, but it's very hard to tell as this game is so stretched and frenetic.

Honduras making a lot of mistakes, but both teams playing with plenty of energy and physicality.

I wouldn't bet on another goalless draw in Curitiba on this evidence.

And Enner Valencia has blown it.

Just a long ball over the top and the Ecuador striker was played on side by Izaguirre, but Valencia volleyed wide of the far post.

Huge let off for Honduras and a big warning.

Shock! Within three seconds of kick-off there are three players laid out on the turf after a meaty Honduran challenge. At least if it’s a spikey affair it will be an improvement on the tedium of 24 hours ago when Japan and Greece played out a predictable stalemate.

A real stretched game this one and a lively first 15 minutes.

Not may chances to report so far, but that's not down to a lack of trying. I sense both teams are desperate for a win to push themselves back into contention in this group.

Those of you who bet on the timing of the first card, it came after six minutes. 

Honduras' Bernardez the man who goes into the book for a cynical foul just outside the area on Enner Valencia.

Real end-to-end stuff to begin this match as first of all Caicedo's direct running and good cross causes problems for Honduras goalkeeper Valladares.

At the other end, Costly led the counter attack and his low cross had Ecuador goalkeeper Dominguez scrambling.

Good atmosphere in Curitiba for this one. Both sets of supporters sense that this is their best chance of a victory.

Ecuador kick us off in Curitiba... and Honduras foul within five seconds.

This could be a good match to bet on card markets.

Two more passionate national anthems, in keeping with the South American (central in Honduras' case) theme, completed and we're ready for kick-off in Curitiba.

Real incentive for the winner today to leap into second place ahead of Switzerland.

Honduras and Ecuador met in a friendly in Texas last November and it finished 2-2 on that occasion.

Carlos Costly scored twice in five minutes for the Hondurans on that occasion, and Ecuador needed an 89th-minute equaliser from Enner Valencia in Houston.

Please don't shut your laptop down after this, but here goes.

Before France's 5-2 win over Switzerland in Salvador, the previous two games at the venue were Spain 1-5 Holland and Germany 4-0 Portugal.

On the other hand, the only other game to be played in Curitiba finished Iran 0-0 Nigeria. The late game last night between Japan and Greece also finished 0-0. 

Things can only get better.

In the words of Kevin Hart - let me explain.

Both these teams played England in warm-up games in Miami. Both actually earned draws that looked very credible back then, that was until England were eliminated after two straight losses. 

Honduras: Valladares, Figueroa, Bernardez, Izaguirre, Bengtson, Costly, Garcia, Espinoza, Garrido, Claros, Beckeles

Ecuador: Dominguez, Guagua, Erazo, Paredes, Noboa, Montero, Ayovi, Caicedo, E. Valencia, Minda, A. Valencia.

Let's be honest, when the World Cup fixtures were announced, this is probably the game that most of us decided we wouldn't stay up for.

But after France smashed Switzerland in Salvador just now, both these teams will feel they are back in the mix for second place in Group E.
