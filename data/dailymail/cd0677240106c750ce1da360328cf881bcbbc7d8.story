When this polar bear cub at Moscow Zoo was given a carton of milk to satisfy its thirst it didn't bank on finding disposing of the rubbish quite so challenging.

The adorable giant was left looking bemused when the empty carton got stuck on the end of its nose.

But far from being panicked, the young bear gave up trying to swipe it from his snout, opting to lie back and relax against a rock instead.

Playful: The bear eventually managed to rip the packaging from his face, but still carried on playing with the litter

Undeterred, when the playful animal eventually managed to rip the packaging from its nose, it carried on playing with the scraps of litter.

Tired out from its milky drink and playing with the empty carton, the bear then cuddled up to its mother for a nap.

Captured by Russian photographer, Olga Gladysheva, the playful polar bear had spectators in fits of laughter as he milked the joke for crowds at Moscow Zoo, Russia.

The bear cubs are sometimes given packets of milk by keepers at the zoo if they do not receive enough from their mother.

Stretching out: The bear stretched out and looked rather sleepy after his milk

Olga said: 'I couldn't believe the bear managed to get the carton stuck on its nose, I was really lucky to be in the right place at the right time.

'Everyone was laughing and pointing at the bear and it looked more than happy with all the attention.

'The bear just seemed to give up after a short while as it was sleepy from all the milk.

'It did manage to get the carton off in the end though and curled up with its mother for a nap after all the fun.

'The polar bear cub is almost fully grown but judging by the bears antics, its certainly not quite an adult yet.'
