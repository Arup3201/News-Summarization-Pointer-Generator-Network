The CPS has withdrawn the allegation that Mr Morrison (pictured) harassed his former girlfriend

Former Manchester United and England Under 21 footballer Ravel Morrison has been cleared of threatening to throw acid in the face of his ex-girlfriend and have her killed.  

He was accused of making the threats against Reah Mansoor, 19, as part of a campaign of harassment that it was alleged lasted from January 2010 to July this year. 

The talented footballer was also accused of threatening to blow up Miss Mansoor's house. 

But the Crown Prosecution Service has now formally withdrawn the allegation, and a verdict of not guilty was formally recorded today during a hearing at Manchester Crown Court which the footballer attended.

The West Ham United player, 21, who is currently on loan at Cardiff City, will still stand trial on the remaining charges of assault against Miss Mansoor and her mother, Parveen Mansoor.

Mr Morrison, who is originally from Manchester, pleaded not guilty to two counts of assault by beating and one of assault causing actual bodily harm on 24 July.

He was arrested in the early hours of July 27 following reports that Miss Mansoor had been assaulted outside a Manchester nightclub and at an address in Salford. Her 39-year-old mother also claimed she had been attacked.

The former Manchester United player denied the harassment charge at a preliminary hearing held in August.

The midfielder was bailed on condition he lives at an address in Cardiff and does not contact his ex-girlfriend and Ms Mansoor, 39.

He cannot enter the Greater Manchester area unless he has a court appearance or when he plays in his professional capacity.

The midfielder, who is currently on loan at Cardiff City (pictured in a match against Millwall) was described by Sir Alex Ferguson as the most talented 14-year-old he had ever seen

Mr Morrison played for Manchester United as a youth player and was regarded by Sir Alex Ferguson as the most talented 14-year-old he had ever seen. 

But a raft of off-field behavioural problems led Ferguson to sell him to West Ham for £650,000 in January 2012.

West Ham manager Sam Allardyce later loaned him to Birmingham and Queens Park Rangers.

Mr Morrison, who has four England Under-21 caps, is currently playing for Championship club Cardiff City on a three-month loan deal.
