Trevor Alllen was crushed to death after a 17 ton lorry was driven over his head during a road-rage incident, a court has heard

A van driver was crushed to death after a 17 ton lorry was driven over his head during a road-rage incident, a court has heard.

Trevor Allen, 56, was murdered after he stood in front of the DAF truck and trailer driven by Mark Slater, Chester Crown Court heard.

The jury was told that another witness said they could hear the sound of bones breaking as Mr Allen, from Swinton, Salford, was crushed.

Slater, 47, of Oldham, Greater Manchester claims it was an accident, and denies the murder of Mr Allen. 

Ian Unsworth QC, prosecuting, told the jury that after some sort of argument in the lead up to the fatal incident at around 8am on April 15 this year on the A57 road on the outskirts of Warrington, Cheshire.

The court heard that both drivers had stopped on the single carriageway road. Mr Allen was out of his van and standing in front of the lorry, it was said.

The prosecution said it would have been 'obvious' to Slater that Mr Allen was in front of him.

Mr Ubsworth said Mr Allen was a 'well nourished' man of 16 stone who was wearing a high visibility jacket.

Mr Unsworth continued: 'Not withstanding that, in all likelihood because the defendant was angry, he simply drove over Mr Allen.

'It is a matter of common sense that the defendant at the wheel of his very large, very heavy lorry, must at least have intended to cause very serious injury.

'Whatever had happened between the two men, you may think, nothing justifies the defendant’s behaviour in the way that he did.'

Three eyewitness, other drivers on the same stretch of road, also saw the incident.

Mr Unsworth said Michael Taylor, driving his Ford Transit van in the opposite direction, saw Mr Allen with his hands up standing in front of the lorry.

Forensic examination showed the victim was dragged underneath with his head in the area of the front driver’s-side wheel.

Kamil Miskiewicz, driving a refuse truck, saw Mr Allen with his arms outstretched, standing in front of the lorry.

Mr Allen, 56, was murdered after he stood in front of the DAF truck and trailer driven by Mark Slater, Chester Crown Court heard. He denies murder, instead claiming it was an accident

Mr Unsworth told the jury: 'He described seeing Trevor Allen’s head explode and seeing his body twist beneath the vehicle. He could hear his bones being broken. The lorry continued to move forward.'

Simon Feltham, on his way to play golf in his Audi A4, stopped near the scene further up the road where Slater’s lorry came to a halt.

He spoke to Slater and dialled 999, the court heard.

The defendant told Mr Feltham that Mr Allen had been 'throwing things' at his lorry and it 'all started down at the lights', the court heard.

Chester Crown Court heard that both drivers had stopped on the single carriageway road. Mr Allen was out of his van and standing in front of the lorry, it was said. The prosecution said it would have been 'obvious' to Slater that Mr Allen was in front of him

When police arrived the defendant told them the victim had pulled up in front of him so he had swerved to go around and Mr Allen then 'dived out' in front of his vehicle.

He was charged with murder the next day.

Mr Unsworth said an analysis of the lorry’s taco-graph suggested that before the fatal incident it had been stationary for nine seconds.

Analysis also showed that before the incident the lorry had on several occasions increased and decreased speed and slowed down from 54mph to a stop after emergency breaking.

The jury were told Slater accepts that he did drive over Mr Allen and caused his death, but denies murder and claims he simply did not see the victim standing in front of his vehicle.

The trial continues.
