Famous feckless father Keith MacDonald, known to the public having allegedly sired 15 children with 14 women is being sought by police for attacking his ex-partner.

He was given the nickname ‘Sunderland Shagger’ after leaving a trail of pregnant women in his wake, was found guilty of headbutting ex-girlfriend Stephanie Jubb.

MacDonald, 27, failed to appear at Sunderland Magistrates’ Court yesterday and the case was heard in his absence.

Love rat Keith MacDonald has been charged with assault of his former girlfriend. MacDonald has hit the headlines multiple times for fathering an alleged 15 children with 14 mothers and letting the state pay the bill

This is not the first time MacDonald, who relies on benefits, has attacked one of his partners. In 2008, he was given a three-year suspended sentence and ordered to undertake an anger management course after assaulting Bec Wright who gave birth to his daughter, Clio, in the same year.

Defence barrister Gavin Sword told the court the reason for MacDonald’s absence was that he lost his train ticket from his new home in Stoke and was unable to afford a new one.

The court heard how the victim and MacDonald had begun their relationship in 2005 but by 2006 the couple were no longer living together.

Describing their on-off relationship, 
which saw them break up for the last time in 2009, Stephanie Jubb said: 
‘It was the end of 2011 when I heard from him again.

‘He said that he was getting older. At first I didn’t think it was a good idea but he kept in regular contact.’

Victim: Stephanie Jubb, mother of unemployed serial love rat Keith MacDonald's 5th child and victim of the assault

By February 2012 the couple were living together yet again, however at around 5pm on March 1 this year an argument over a ‘toastie’ ended violently.

MacDonald’s former girlfriend said: ‘He came back and I could smell alcohol on his breath and his eyes were quite bloodshot.

‘He was fine he was chatty, he made himself a toastie and went to go upstairs to eat it.

‘I told him “you’re not eating that upstairs, I’ve just hovered.”

‘He then threw the toastie and the plate on the kitchen table and shouted “F*** it!”’

MacDonald then went upstairs to their bedroom and was overheard saying: ‘I’m going back to my house.’

Angered by what she had heard, Miss Jubb went upstairs to confront MacDonald and to get his attention she unplugged his X-Box games console.

In retaliation MacDonald ran downstairs and threw his girlfriend’s Nintendo Wii console across the room.

Describing the following assault, the victim sobbed in the stand.

She said: ‘He started to throw his arms around, he started to contort his face up which I knew would usually be when he was going to lose his temper.

‘I grabbed hold of him by the arms and said “What are you doing? Calm down.”

‘I let go of Keith and Keith let go of my arm.’

However MacDonald renewed his attack on Miss Jubb headbutting her after she tried to prevent him from pushing past her.

The victim said: “Keith grabbed hold of me by both of my arms and headbutted me in the face.

‘There was pain in my nose and my eyes started to water, I didn’t know at the time that my nose was bleeding.

‘I only noticed the blood on my t-shirt when I got next door.’

Miss Jubb ran for help from their next-door-neighbour Paul Gascoigne where they alerted the police.

Speaking at court yesterday, Mr Gascoigne said: ‘(She) virtually fell into the house when my mother opened the door.

‘We took her in and she was hysterical. The girl was bleeding a lot from her nose and she had a cut on the bridge of her nose.’

The police arrived 20 minutes later and escorted the victim back into her house.

MacDonald had fled but his female victim immediately spotted that her white Sony Ericsson mobile phone was missing from its usual spot on top of the fridge.

Upon further inspection she discovered that £160 of her savings was missing.

The victim was taken to the University Hospital of North Durham to be checked over.

She was discharged with a laceration to her nose and swelling to her face.

She said: ‘I had two black eyes the next day.

‘I felt upset, angry and hurt.’

MacDonald was spotted on the street by duty police officers the next day and he was arrested and taken to Washington Police Station where he was interviewed.

He was today found guilty of a count of common assault by beating.

He was also found guilty of criminal damage to a Nintendo Wii and theft of cash and a mobile phone.

A warrant was made for MacDonald’s arrest.
