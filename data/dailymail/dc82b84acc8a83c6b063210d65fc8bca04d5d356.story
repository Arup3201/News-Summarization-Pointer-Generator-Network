Distinction: Time says its 'Person of the Year' is reshaping global politics

'The protester' has been named Time magazine's 'Person of the Year' for 2011.

The selection was announced today on NBC's Today Show.

The magazine cited dissent across the Middle East that spread to Europe and the U.S., and said these protesters are reshaping global politics.

The runner-up for the distinction included Admiral William H. McRaven, who organized the raid that led to Osama bin Laden’s death in May.

Also considered were Chinese conceptual artist Ali Wei Wei,  Wisconsin Rep Paul Ryan and Duchess of Cambridge Kate Middleton.

An online poll by the Today Show showed overwhelming support for former Apple honcho Steve Jobs and Rep Gabrielle Giffords.

Last year, Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg was given the honour.

Movement: From the Arab Spring to Occupy Wall Street, protests have been a major part of 2011, according to Time magazine

Time's 'Person of the Year' is the person or thing that has most influenced the culture and the news during the past year for good or for ill.

It’s
confusing to many that Kate Middleton was snubbed by Time for 'Person 
of the Year' in spite of her fairy tale wedding, keen fashion sense and 
charitable good deeds.

The naming of 'protesters' instead 
of names like Rep Gabrielle Giffords, SEAL Team 6, Steve Jobs and 
the Duchess of Cambridge has left critics trashing the magazine.

Time's Person of the Year' is the 
person or thing that has most influenced the culture and the news during
the past year for good or for ill, editors said.

The Royal Wedding was watched by about 47 per cent of the world population.

As she walked down the aisle on April 29, many were treated to a spectacle not seen since Diana did the same in 1981.

Time does, however, feature Middleton in feature piece separate from the 'Person of the Year' piece.

Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke received the honour in 2009. The 2008 winner was then-President-elect Barack Obama.

Speaking of presidents, they often dominate the outcome, from former President George W. Bush to Jimmy Carter and John F. Kennedy.

Other previous non-presidential winners have included Bono, Pope John Paul II, and Amazon.com CEO and founder Jeff Bezos.

Controversial winners in the past 
have ranged from Adolf Hitler in 1938 to Joseph Stalin, who was named 
Person of the Year in 1939 and 1942.

Former U.S. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt is the only 'Person of the Year' to win the title three times.

Time said it is recognizing protesters because they are 'redefining people power' around the world.

Time managing editor Rick Stengel told the Today show; 'There was a lot of consensus among our people. It felt right.'

The 'Person of the Year' mention began in 1927, when the magazine named legendary pilot Charles Lindbergh as the first recipient of the honor.

Runner-up: Admiral William H. McRaven, the man who organized the raid that took down Osama bin Laden in May, was a close second to 'the protester'

Considered: Kate Middleton, who captured the hearts of Americans before the Royal Wedding, was also considered for 'Person of the Year'

Controversial: Other 'Person of the Year' winners have included Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin, who has won twice
