Upset: Louise Allain, 41, wishes she had never taken the original job in Cherie Blair's office last year

She champions working mothers and preaches to bosses about their duty to adopt family-friendly policies.

Cherie Blair, however, seems to have trouble with flexibility in her own office.

The wife of the former prime minister was yesterday accused of ‘sheer hypocrisy’ after sacking a single mother who was unable to take on more hours.

Louise Allain says she was made redundant after telling barrister Mrs Blair her childcare commitments meant she could not change her work from part time to full time.

The 41-year-old suggested working some of the time from home or job sharing, but this was rejected.

Last night, Miss Allain said that she felt ‘utterly betrayed’ by Mrs Blair, who she said had ‘thrown her on the scrap heap’ just for wanting to look after her children.

She said: ‘I feel an utter sense of injustice. It’s sheer hypocrisy. How can she go from being a forward thinking boss who you couldn’t ask for more from to being so dispassionate and cold.

‘She had turned her back on me because I would not work full time. She is supposed to empower women, she goes around the world empowering women, but when it comes to a single woman on her own and struggling in her own office, she just says get lost.’

Miss Allain, who lives in Central London, was offered a job working in the personal office of Mrs Blair just over a year ago.

The two met when her son was in the same class at school as Leo Blair. After the single mother-of-two confided in Mrs Blair that she was struggling to find work that fitted with looking after her son, 14, and daughter, nine, Mrs Blair offered her a role working 16 and a half hours a week.

University-educated Miss Allain said: ‘It had been difficult trying to find work. I had a good CV, but getting into work was hard.

‘We met at a function and she said “Do you want to work at my personal office? You could do hours to suit the children”.

I felt very blessed. I thought, what an extraordinary person to do that – to take me from a situation where I was struggling to a new start.’

The job allowed her to drop the children at school and then finish work in time to see them at the end of the day.

‘It was a friendly atmosphere in the office,’ she said. ‘There were just five of us. Cherie was very nice. I did three days a week from 9.30am to 3pm, it suited me.’

For just over a year, she worked at the office in London where her role involved replying to correspondence and updating Mrs Blair’s website.

But in January, after an office re-organisation, she was asked if she would change to a full-time job, working until 6pm five days a week.

'Dispassionate': Cherie Blair, Miss Allain says, went from being a perfect boss to being incredibly cold

Email correspondence seen by the Mail, shows how Miss Allain was sacked from her £12,500-a-year role by Mrs Blair by email on January 16, after she turned down working 9am to 6pm five days a week.

After Miss Allain wrote an email stating how she did not think she could balance the extra hours, Mrs Blair replied: ‘I am really sorry Louise that it’s not been possible to make it work but we need the role to be full time.’

When Miss Allain asked if that meant she was being fired, Mrs Blair curtly responded: ‘You are being made redundant as there is no longer a part time role.’

Miss Allain suggested to the office manager that she work 9am to 6pm two days a week on a job share, but she says she was told, ‘that won’t work, it’s messy’.

She then asked if she could do some of the hours from home, but was told this would not be possible.

How can she go from being a forward thinking boss who you couldn’t ask for more from to being so dispassionate and cold?

Miss Allain said that she now wished 
she had never taken the job. ‘I am just washed up,’ she said. 
‘Prospective employers see I worked for her for only a year before 
leaving and think that is suspect.

‘If you explain what happened, they think, “Mrs Blair would not have done that”.

‘I’d have been better off never taking the job.’

She
 added: ‘I genuinely feel hurt. My daughter has a couple more years at 
primary school. I want to be around for parent evenings and to help with
 homework.

‘The children 
will grow up quickly and I felt indebted because I thought Mrs Blair 
appreciated I wanted face to face time with them.

'Now
 I’ve got next month’s bills coming up, loans to pay and I don’t have 
another salary. I’ve had to sign on. I never wanted to see the inside of
 a job centre again.

‘I thought she had pulled me away from that place, but now she has sent me back.’

Mrs
 Blair, who returned to her work as a barrister after the birth of each 
of her four children, has been a frequent proponent of flexible working.

Last year, in an article calling for 
employers not to ‘squander the talents of modern mothers’, Mrs Blair 
wrote that bosses had to set a ‘personal example’ in adopting 
‘family-friendly policies’.

She wrote: ‘We need to think about what we can do to support parents who want to prioritise full-time caring for a period when their children are young...

‘We all need to do more as individuals, as employers and as a community to make space for people to make these choices and rejoice in diversity in family life’

She said stay-at-home mothers should get government funded training and subsidised salaries to encourage them to return to work and boost the economy.

She suggested they should be given ‘returnerships’ – apprentice-style programmes for parents after long breaks from the workforce spent caring for their children.

And in an interview in November last year, Mrs Blair added: ‘Flexible working is really important but it’s really important that firms don’t look on this as “the mummy track”, i.e., for those who are not going to make it. They need to acknowledge that part-time workers can make a real contribution.’

Mrs Blair said the state could subsidise salary and training for the first six months that a parent, either a father or a mother, returned to work. She also argued that employers should be encouraged to create more part-time, family friendly jobs to tempt women back into employment.

Last night a spokesman for Mrs Blair said: ‘Cherie’s office is very small, but she does try where possible to offer part-time jobs to women with young children, indeed there are two other part-timers with children who continue to work there.’
