Atletico Madrid warmed up for their Champions League final clash with neighbours Real Madrid still awaiting news on injured pair Diego Costa and Arda Turan.

Neither trained with Diego Simeone's first team, with 35-goal striker Diego Costa in Belgrade to see 'miracle doctor' Marijaba Kovacevic in a bid to be fit in time for the game in Lisbon.

Turkish winger Turan is also facing a struggle to be ready for the match, having picked up a knee problem during the title decider with Barcelona. He trained alone yesterday.

Plan A? Diego Simeone trained his Atletico Madrid team on Wednesday morning

Missing: Diego Costa ad Arda Turan were missing from the session

SOS: Diego Costa in Belgrade, where he is to see the controversial 'placenta doctor' in a bid to recover

Costa has a
 grade one hamstring tear, an injury that would usually leave players 
out for around two weeks - if the treatment doesn't work he is 
definitely out of the game.

Costa, a transfer target for Chelsea, is due back in Spain later today.

Carlo Ancelotti yesterday confirmed that Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale will both be fit for the showpiece.

Listening in: Raul Garcia, David Villa and Mario Suarez listen in to instructions

Last time: Thibaut Courtois is preparing for his last game in red and white after a three-year loan spell

Neither player trained with the first team yesterday, but the Italian boss was confident of their inclusion.

Ronaldo, who hasn't played since May 7, trained alone but said he will be ready.

'I feel good but still not 100 per cent. I hope to be ready for Saturday,' the Portuguese told Real Madrid TV.

Bale didn't train at all, but he was given an extra rest day after making his first appearance in two weeks on Saturday.
