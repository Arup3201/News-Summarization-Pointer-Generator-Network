Progressive Brentford are set to complete the loan signing of Sunderland striker Danny Graham until January.

The 29-year-old has found first team opportunities limited at the Stadium of Light since signing for £5million from Swansea City two years ago. 

Graham has been out on loan at Hull City and then Middlesbrough but struggled to find the net consistently.

Gus Poyet has decided to allow Graham to move on again after playing just two minutes of Capital One Cup football for the Black Cats this season. 

It does represent something of a coup for the Championship Bees, however. 

They have impressed since gaining promotion from League One last season, but have found goals difficult to come by in recent weeks.
