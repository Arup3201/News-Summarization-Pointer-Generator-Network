A branch of the National Guard has launched an investigation after a risqué British swimsuit calender was shot using its facilities and equipment, allegedly without proper authorization.

Video footage of the models from Hot Shots, who were putting together their 2015 edition, was released showing them behind tank controls and firing automatic rifles on the Utah National Guard base in Draper. 

The clip begins with UK model Rosie Jones welcoming viewers to Utah in the 'U.S of A' and introducing them to new additions to the line up.

Probe: An investigation has been launched by the Utah National Guard after a British swimsuit calendar was shot on their base in Draper, Utah

Attire: Images show the models firing heavy artillery while dressed in their swimsuits. There have been questions raised as to whether the equipment was used without authorization 

At the end of the video, the group give special thanks to the Soldiers of the 19th Special Forces Group, suggesting they may have been involved. 

The calendar, once put on the shelves in November, raises money for Help For Heroes - a British military charity who support wounded veterans and their families. 

The money raised also goes to the US equivalent ‘Special Operations Wounded Warrior Foundation'. 

Some of the poses included them throwing explosives, firing machine guns and sitting in tanks.

Another included a picture of two of the models taking aim behind a sniper rifle while in the snow. 

Utah National Guard Lt. Col. Steven Fairbourn told FOX 13 that an internal investigation had been initiated to determine if the guard's 'equipment, facilities and personnel' was used in the calendar shoot.

Concerns: Questions were also raised as to whether members of the Utah National Guard themselves were involved, as the group of models thanked them at the end of the video 

Terrain: One of the shots was taken next to a boat as the models waded in the river 

He said in a statement: 'An investigation was initiated by the Utah National Guard on October 14 to determine potential unauthorized use of military equipment, facilities, and personnel in the Hot Shots 2015 calendar production.

'Productions of this kind are not in keeping with the values of the Utah National Guard nor its members.

'Use of military equipment, facilities, and personnel in civilian for-profit endeavors such as this requires approval of National Guard Bureau Public Affairs through the respective state National Guard Headquarters. 

Vehicles: A statement from the National Guard said 'civilian for-profit endeavors' required approval from the National Guard Bureau of Public Affairs  

'There was no official approval for this project. The investigation will determine if Utah National Guard equipment, facilities, and personnel were used in the Hot Shots 2015 calendar production and required actions if this is the case.'

House Minority Leader Jennifer Seelig, D-Salt Lake City, told the station: 'If this video was shot at a government restricted facility using government specialized military equipment, either leadership knew about this — or their security protocols aren't robust enough to keep a bunch of calendar girls and their crew and assorted groupies out'

Mail Online have contacted the company behind the shoot and Help For Heroes for comment. 

Cause: The calendar raises money for British military charity Help for Heroes - who help provide financial support to wounded troops and their families
