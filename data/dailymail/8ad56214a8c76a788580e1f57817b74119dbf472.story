A six-year-old boy was airlifted to hospital with serious head injuries after  he fell 12-feet from a window after bouncing on his bed.

Connor Bradley, 6, began jumping on the bed with his four-year-old sister Chelsea Piggford after their mum left the room.

Just seconds later, mum Vikki Bradley, 24,  heard screaming from Chelsea and burst into the bedroom to find Connor had gone.

She looked out of the window of her home on the Tudhoe Moor Estate, near Spennymoor, to find her son lying in a pool of blood on the concrete block paving below.

She dialled 999 in floods of tears and ran to help her injured son.

She said: 'I was petrified, I’d never been so scared in my life - it was 
horrible.

'Neighbours came to help as Connor lay on the floor crying and paramedics were on the scene within ten minutes.'

Miss Bradley was on the phone to her grandmother when she left the kids playing in the front bedroom at about 4pm on Tuesday.

She said: 'I was on the phone to my grandma when they came in and started bouncing on my bed.

'Before I went I told them to pack it in and stopped messing on. I was only out of the room for a few seconds when I heard Chelsea shouting: "Connor’s gone, Connor’s gone out of the window."

'I looked out and I just saw the pool of blood first and came down the stairs 
and rang 999.

The Great North Air Ambulance was called to the scene, and after being assessed by a doctor and paramedics, the boy was flown to the the James Cook University Hospital in Middlesbrough.

But after being assessed by doctors, he was allowed home on Wednesday night.

After bouncing on the bed, Connor says he climbed onto the window sill and fell backwards.

He said: 'I looked out of the window for my sisters skateboard, I turned round and then I fell.

'The hospitals all came after my mam rang 999 and I went in a helicopter.'

Connor had a wound on the crown of his head which was glued back together and his arm was placed in a sling.

He had a CT scan in case he had suffered brain damage and X-rays taken of his chest and shoulder and an ultrasound on his stomach.

A neighbour, who did not want to be named said: 'I was upstairs and heard a scream and ran straight out.

'I got to the garden and saw the little boy lying on the patio and he’d fallen 
from a first-floor bedroom window.

'When the others arrived and called for the ambulance, I tried to entertain his brothers and sisters and friends.

'We asked him what had happened and he said he’d been jumping on a bed and had fallen out of the window.'

Police in Spennymoor said they were not treating the incident as suspicious.

Another neighbour, who did not wish to be named, said: 'He was just playing and fell backwards and it was just an accident.

'His mother came to me for help and I tried to talk to him to keep him 
conscious and he was calling for him mam.

'The air ambulance landed behind the houses and I ran to bring the doctor to the scene.

'He had a very lucky escape as he fell onto a concrete floor.'

Miss Bradley is now getting security locks fitted on the windows and Connor has promised never to play near them again.

Miss Bradley thanked the emergency services and neighbours for all their help.
