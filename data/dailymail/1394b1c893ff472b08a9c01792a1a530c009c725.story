Ricky Alvarez celebrated his move to the Premier League by meeting Pope Francis – but is he the answer to Sunderland’s creative prayers?

The Inter Milan playmaker completed a season-long loan switch to the Stadium of Light on deadline day, with a view to making the deal permanent for £8.5millon next summer.

But what will the 26-year-old bring to Wearside? Sportsmail takes a closer look…

Inter Milan to Sunderland… Why?

Inter are going through a rebuilding process after a couple of disappointing seasons and Alvarez, despite appearing 29 times in Serie A last year, was one player coach Walter Mazzarri was willing to let go in a bid to manoeuvre his squad. Gus Poyet was alerted and Sunderland moved quickly to get the deal in place last week.

Physical presence: Ricky Alvarez is 6ft 2in but has a proven touch and good vision

So how has he fared at the San Siro?

He leaves with 11 goals from 73 appearances over three seasons – which is a fair return on both counts – but there have been periods where he has struggled to impact and his future at the club questioned.

He has failed to make one position on the park his own, but at the same time has shown flashes of creative genius, especially when operating in a withdrawn role behind a striker.

The frustration for Inter fans was amplified by the reputation with which he arrived and the inability to produce his best on a consistent basis.

What about his early days?

His move to Europe came after four seasons with Velez Sarsfield, where a cruciate ligament injury had curtailed his early progress. But come the end of his time in Argentina his stock was high and, having just helped Velez to a second league championship, Inter paid £10m for the then 23-year-old.

Proven quality: Ricky Alvarez has seven caps for Argentina and has scored one goal 

So what type of player is he?

He’s a rangy type – 6ft 2ins – and not particularly pacey either, but it’s his skill and vision on the ball which makes him a full international and persuaded Inter to invest all that money three years ago.

His first touch is second nature and he can unlock a defence in an instant.

Where will he fit in at Sunderland?

Left-footed, Alvarez can cut in from the right flank – but that is a domain already populated by Adam Johnson. His best performances for Inter came in a No.10 role and, to that end, he could well operate in an advanced position of a midfield three alongside Lee Cattermole and Jack Rodwell.

So will he prove a success?

He’s certainly got a point to prove, inconsistency being his key criticism. But there is ability there and he was part of the Argentina squad which finished runners-up at the World Cup in Brazil.

He’s currently on international duty and met Pope Francis this week – and Poyet will be hoping Alvarez repays the faith he has shown in his fellow South American.
