An American surgeon believes he can save the life of a six year old girl suffering from a rare and dangerous condition called hypothalamic obesity.

Hana Tarraf has put on a kilogram a week since having a brain tumour removed at the beginning of the year.

The procedure caused a rare condition where the brain can no longer regulate caloric intake.

The little girl from Bondi, Sydney is wheelchair-bound most of the time as she struggles to 'stand in one spot for more than a minute', her mum Naomi Cook told Daily Mail Australia.  

Dr Thomas Inge says hypothalamic obesity, which Hana Tarraf suffers from, is very difficult to treat with diet because the body adapts

Dr Thomas Inge runs the Surgical Weight Loss Program for Teens, an Ohio-based clinic at the Children's Hospital Medical Centre.

He told The Sunday Telegraph hypothalamic obesity is very difficult to treat by changing food intake, since the body will adapt and slow down metabolic rate to continue the weight gain.

Dr Inge says hypothalamic obesity was very difficult to treat with diet because the body reacts to restricted calorie intake by slowing down energy expenditure to continue the weight gain.

Instead he has urged the family to consider bariatric surgery, or gastric bypass surgery, which involves the removal of part of the stomach.

It is generally shunned for children as young as Hana, and there is little research done on this age group, however the doctor believes it is her only viable option.

The surgery restricts calorie intake, as well as working like interrupting the signals from the brain to eat.

Dr Inge told the Sunday Telegraph: 'What it seems to do is readjust the set point for weight that the body is trying to achieve, whether the circuit is related to the energy burn or the energy intake, we don't know. There is something about the operation that works on the intake side, but it's more complex.'

The doctor has agreed to consult with the Tarraf family next week.

Before her surgery she weighed 21 kilos, but now weighs 44 kilos and is continuing to put on weight

The six-year-old, here with mum Ms Cook, is gaining on average a kilo each week

Hana's condition also means she is constantly hungry, due to the signals being transmitted from her brain to her stomach.

'She cries a lot, she gets cranky, she gets grumpy and she'll stare into space,' Ms Cook said.

'She'll be playing a game and she'll say 'Dad I don't want to think about food',' her dad Nour Tarraf added. 

When they took their eldest daughter to hospital in January of this year with concerns about her thyroid, they were devastated when told she had actually developed a brain tumour.

When the day of the appointment came Hana had been suffering from a 'massive headache' for two days and a scan was done as a precautionary measure.

'The CT scan found a tennis ball sized tumour', Mr Tarraf revealed.

Hana had surgery the same month and her parents said the fallout from the operation could have been 'blindness, seizures and even death'.

While their daughter was in intensive care recovering from the procedure to remove the tumour, 'Naomi started to look into what other complications there could be', Mr Tarraf said.

'She (Naomi) was in hospital asking the doctors about this increased chance of weight gain', he continued, before adding that through their research he and Ms Cook had discovered there was an 85 per cent chance of Hana developing weight problems.

Now, nine months later, Hana, 6, is still gaining weight - almost a kilogram every week - with no sign of it slowing.

She is constantly hungry as the messages from her brain to her stomach 

'It's ten months later and we have a child that is morbidly obese at six,' Ms Cook said.

'We do have to use the wheelchair to get around, she has severe knee and ankle pain. She can't stand on the spot for more than a minute.'

This struggle can also be isolating for Hana at school, as she can't join her classmates sitting on the floor when they're reading, and instead must sit on a chair up the back.

Breakfast: A bowl of cereal and a piece of toast with a spread on it

Morning Tea: A handful of nuts

Lunch: A sandwich and a salad 

Afternoon Tea:  A piece of fruit or some nuts

Dinner: Vegetable soup with some rice, followed by a yoghurt

Hana's diet is very tightly controlled by her parents, and she is fed only small portions of very healthy food each day to slow her weight gain down. 

'Hana's weight has nothing to do with diet, her body became hardwired ... her body is telling her she is starving', Ms Cook said.

'Hana is very disciplined, there's other conditions where children have no control and they simply eat what they see or go searching for food,' her father added.

'She doesn't eat unless we actually allow her to. She will sit there and cry but she won't actually go searching for food. 

'Her stomach is full, but her brain is hungry. Her brain is saying eat eat eat,' he continued.

Though the toughest part for Ms Cook and Mr Tarraf has been trying to get Hana specialised treatment in Australia.

'We have found it difficult to see someone - it's not considered an emergency so when you ring a specialist they just slot you in to their books', Mr Tarraf said.

Hana's family are desperately trying to get expert medical help for their daughter

Her parents have been conducting their own research, and have contacted medical experts overseas. Hana is pictured here before her surgery

The couple have been conducting a lot of research during the 12 weeks they've been waiting for Hana to see someone, and have even reached out to researchers overseas.

One German specialist responded to their five page long list of questions to him with an equally detailed answer, and Hana's parents believe they need to enlist the help of international medical experts if they want to combat their daughter's rare condition. 

'Some children are very lucky and they do reach a stablisation after a few months, we haven't and see no signs of this happening yet for Hana,' Ms Cook said.

'In my mind and my husbands mind this is ultimately a life-threatening condition and we need help.'

Hana, here with sister Maryam, needs someone who is willing to do some extra work to help their daughter

However Ms Cook and Mr Tarraf were adamant that the doctors that had been treating their daughter in Australia were at no fault, but their situation was particularly complex.

'We understand their position, we know that it's difficult and it might be outside is a lot of people's expertise,' Mr Tarraf said.

'What Hana needs is someone who is prepared to do some extra work and someone who's willing to get out of their comfort zone,' he added.

Hana doesn't fit the mold for many people suffering from hypothalamic obesity,and a plan needs to be put in place according to her parents.

Though Ms Cook said there was one thing she was thankful for out of this ordeal her daughter has gone through.

'She doesn't have yet - thank god - have any understanding that she is obese.'

'I hope that by the time she's old enough, or in the next few months, we will find a solution for her that will help that,' Ms Cook added.
