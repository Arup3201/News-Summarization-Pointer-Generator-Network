Britain’s super-rich are turning their backs on buying up historic stately homes in favour of building their own from scratch, according to luxury estate agents.

Experts in the top end of the property market say sky-high renovation costs and restrictive planning regulations are driving the wealthy to dream up their own ideal homes from scratch.

And they are filling their dream homes with every conceivable luxury without the need for a bottomless sink fund to pay for the costly upkeep of older houses.

New grandeur: The super-rich are increasingly turning to custom-designed houses rather than existing stately homes. Pictured above is Field House, near Ablington, Gloucestershire, which is on sale for £4million

Splendour: Another striking example of the new opulence is the above property, Abbotts Wood, near Taplow in Buckinghamshire. It is currently on the market with an asking price of £7.5million

Interior: Pictured is the living and dining area of Abbotts Wood, which is set in 56 acres of its own land and built in the Palladian style with modern materials

Luxuriant: This indoor cinema room is another part of Abbotts Wood, one of an increasing number of properties built to order on country estates of the super-rich

The new, multi-million-pound properties have been popping up across the country over the past few years - and are being heralded as the stately homes of the future.

Wealthy buyers have been drawn to building new homes from scratch because the costs are significantly lower than restoring and running period properties.

Modern technology like eco-friendly biomass boilers and solar panels can dramatically reduce the running costs of new homes, which are easier to build and adapt in the first place due to laxer planning laws. 

However, the grandeur of the properties is unchanged from those built hundreds of years ago.

Old style: Field House in Gloucestershire, pictured from above with its garden visible, was built in the classic Cotsworld style, though it is only a few years old

Sturdy: The construction of the new wave of stately homes makes extensive use of heavy woods and stone. Pictured is Field House's hallway

Extensive: The kitchen in Field House, pictured, has both stone-paved floors and marble tops to its work surfaces, which estate agents say will endure for decades

Lengthy: Field House also boasts its own swimming poolin its garden, with skuyights and exposed wooden beams

Rustic: The wooden beams dissecting this living room give the £4million new-build a more authentic feel, in keeping with the older properties in the region

Picturesque: Field House also has extensive grounds, featuring its own walled garden

Sun-kissed: The £2.75million Yew Trees, pictured above, is another example of a newly-built home, which was finished in 2013

Traditional: The Georgian-style home, in Hampshire, has a modern kitchen with a classic colour scheme, and boasts an Aga as well as sweeping white work sufaces

Winding driveways flanked by sprawling gardens, leading in turn to opulent facades are still the norm. Interiors, too, have been given a modern makeover but traditional building materials such as wood and stone still feature highly.

Swimming pools, tennis courts, riding stables, personal gyms, cinemas and wine cellars are among the flashy features built in to the modern stately homes. 

One example, Leyton House, was built in 2014 on Crown estate land in Oxshott, Surrey, and is on the market for a £6.5million through Knight Frank.

It boasts six bedrooms, an indoor pool, spa and gym, a 3D cinema, underfloor heating and walk-in wardrobes in every room.

Palatial: Leton House, which is built on Crown land near Oxshott, Surrey, is built in the Palladian style and is set to sell for £6.85million

Airy: The huge hallway has two rows of tall windows, letting in a huge amount of natural light. The open feel is accentuated by two fold-back doors

Cooling off: The seven-bedroom home boasts its own indoor swimming pool next to the garden, overlooked by a huge skylight

Kitted-out: The kitchen is awash with modern features including expansive worktops, modern hobs and an assortment of other cooking devices

Another is Kingswood House, completed this year from Cotswold stone and sits among six acres of land in Woodstock, Oxfordshire, close to the Blenheim estate.

It has six bedrooms, five reception rooms, seven bathrooms, a grand, tree-lined drive, a biomass boiler and a private bore hole supplying water to the house.  

The house, on the market for £4.5million with Strutt and Parker, also has grand landscaped gardens, separate accommodation for a housekeeper and nanny and a tennis court. 

Cotswold-style: Kingswood House, near Woodstock, Oxfordshire, is buily from stone hewn in the Cotswolds and has a guide price of £4.5million

Approach: Likely stately homes of old, the property has a sweeping, tree-lined driveway along which visitors can see the full grandeur of the house

Courts: Kingswood House also boasts its own tennis court - sports facilities are one of the features demanded by many wealthy homebuilders bringing their dream to life

Towering: The stone-floored hallway features a spiralling staircase which extends two floors up and is bathed in light by a downward-facing window 

Experts claim the luxury mansions will still be standing in 200 years’ time - and will be looked upon as the period houses of their time.

Mark Wheeler, director of country houses at Hamptons estate agents, said: 'In recent years there has been a definite move away from the drafty, old rectories and Edwardian manor houses towards modern, comfortable and cost efficient properties.

'It is many people’s dream to design and build their own house exactly to their own specifications.

'The quality nowadays is so much higher and the running costs are significantly less in comparison to centuries old houses.

'New builds also come with a 10-year guarantee, so effectively you have cost-free living for a good while rather than instant renovation bills or maintenance costs.

Opulent: Warrenbayne, a Palladian-style house on St George's Hill private estate near Weybridge, Surrey, is set to sell for £12.5million

Personal leisure centre: The huge home also features its own swimming pool, and a Jacuzzi-style whirpool bath, all surrounded by stone floor panels

Classical style: The pillared home has a grand dining area which looks on to an outdoor pool lined with trees

'In a hundred years time these modern stately homes will be the period houses of their time. I think they will stand the test of time because the build quality is extremely high.

'There are some similarities between new and old though - the principals of quality and grandeur are still as important as they ever were.

'You have to remember that old stately homes were cutting edge when they were built. Modern stately homes are just following in that same tradition.'

Country living: Ash Park, near Plaistow village in West Sussex is on the market for £5.95million and has its own lake and 8.6 acres of landscaped gardens

Fancy a dip? The home also has its own stylish swimming pool, as well as tennis courts, a lake and seven bedrooms

William Morrison, of Knight Frank, added: 'There has always been a desire among buyers to build their own houses exactly to their specification.

'But it is even more evident at the top of the market where people can afford to build their dream homes with everything they want inside.

'Many large, older houses are listed buildings - making it difficult to adapt them plus running costs are often very high.

'With modern stately homes you have the ability to build a property which is state of the art, cheap to run and environmentally friendly.

'The emphasis is still on quality and being cutting edge, as well as showing off modern British architecture.'

Wooded: Beechwood House near Dippenhall, Surrey, has six bedrooms and a guide price of £4.25million

Red-brick: This home near Dorking, Surrey, is set to sell for £3.85million, and combines older-style brickwork with new, modern features

Interior: The inside of the home, which boasts a large stone fireplace, are also very modern, with exposed brickwork criss-crossing the windows
