Louis van Gaal ended his post-match press conference on a prickly note after being asked about the failings of Manchester United's on loan striker Radamel Falcao.

Falcao was left as an unused substitute as United pressed for an equaliser in their FA Cup defeat to Arsenal, but Van Gaal was quick to defend his forward.

The Dutch manager interrupted a journalist asking about the striker to defend his forward's record, and hit out at the press for enjoying the Colombian's dismal record, before ending with a sarcastic remark.

Van Gaal was in a bad mood at the press conference, pointing accusingly at a journalist for the question

As he left the room the Dutchman sarcastically remarked 'very good question', and gave a thumbs up

The United boss decided not to use Falcao despite chasing an equaliser, keeping the expensive star benched

'He scored four goals and has 3 or 4 assists, so that is his contribution,' said a clearly annoyed Van Gaal. 'And he stimulates also the other players, so that's also an aspect of the profession.'

'But it is now easy for you to say that (criticism of Falcao), and that's why you are saying that. And you are very happy to say that, I see that in your face.'

When the journalist then pointed out that four goals is not very much for a striker on £280,000 a week, Van Gaal seemed to agree, but continued to take issue with the line of questioning.

The 63-year-old took issue with the line of inquiry about Falcao, interrupting a journalist's question

Falcao has scored four goals since joining on loan, a meagre return for £280,000 per week

Van Gaal issues tactical instructions during the game, but was unable to stem the tide against Arsenal

'Yes,' he responded. 'I cannot change that. I cannot change facts, and you know that. But you can continue.'

The United boss then called an end to his press conference, before leaving with a sarcastic jibe of 'very good question' to the offending journalist, and giving him the thumbs up.
