A Russian tycoon has become the victim of a cement bucket challenge after his gleaming £165,000 Bentley received a dousing when he parked too close to a construction site.

Artur Shachnev parked his prized Bentley too close to a Moscow building site when workers from a height of 50 feet accidentally spilt seven tonnes of wet cement, which then dried on the car.

By the time he noticed, the Bentley was concreted over and very seriously damaged.

Mr Shachnev tried his best to laugh off the damage caused to his car. He posted on Facebook: 'Today my close friend, which died suddenly under some tonnes of construction cement, left me'

The 32-year-old did his best to laugh off the nightmare to his Bentley, which he nicknames Bantik.

He posted on Facebook: 'Today my close friend, which died suddenly under some tonnes of construction cement, left me. 

'Rest in peace, my dear Bantik, under concrete.'

The car's headlights and boot were damaged too, as were his expensive suits which were inside the vehicle .

He has passed the problem to his insurance company which has so far not commented.

Mr Shachnev, the CEO of a music production company, challenged Russia's political clown, ultranationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky, to take the cement bucket challenge in his wake.

By the time Mr Shachnev had noticed what had happened, the Bentley was concreted over and very seriously damaged

As pictures of his car were shared on Russian websites, Shachnev spoke of 'my famous concreted Bentley'.

'I hope to get into the Guinness Record Book, because 7 tonnes of cement from a height of 15 meters is not a bucket of ice,' he said.

'If I don't get the proposal to compensate me for the damage from the representatives of the developer, I will go to the court,' he vowed.

The car owner said he had been contacted by the deputy general director of the construction company at the site of the disaster, which is owned by the Institute of World Civilisations.

Mr Schachnev has now passed the incident on to his insurance company to assess the damage

The company had promised to compensate him for all losses, but had yet to make a specific proposal, he said.

'It's impossible to clean the concrete off the entire body of the car,' he said.

'It needs to be changed. A new body would cost twice the price of my car, which I've been using for three years.'
