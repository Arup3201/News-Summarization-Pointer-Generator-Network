It's Tebow Time on Good Morning America. The one-time NFL quarterback made his debut on ABC today with an inspiring story of a little boy who overcame the loss of both his legs and returned to the football field.

The network has hired Tim Tebow to anchor a new segment called 'Motivate Me Mondays.'

It's the latest step into the broadcast world for the former college star, whose NFL career peaked and then dried up under the national spotlight.

Come on out! Tim Tebow made a grand entrance on Good Morning America Today, stepping through a specially made 'Motivate Me Monday' door

Tebow Time: Tebow's winning smile was on full display as he talked passionately about his new gig - which has him roving the country searching for inspiring stories of courageous kids

Tebow, a Heisman Trophy winner for the Florida Gators, works as a college football analyst for ESPN and the new SEC Network. He will travel across the U.S. for Good Morning America to tell feel-good stories for the morning show.

Tebow's first segment was about 10-year-old Deven Jackson, a Pennsylvania boy who lost both his his legs six inches below the knee after contracting meningitis. 

The horrified disease nearly killed him, but he fought back - and returned to playing football thanks to a pair of donated running blades.

'To be able to share these amazing stories about kids who have so much courage and have overcome so many obstacles and that's what really inspiring. It's awesome for me to be able to share these stories,' he told GMA. 

Tebow's first segment focused on 10-year-old Deven Jackson, who lost both legs after a horrific bout of meningitis. He learned to walk again and eventually returned to football - the game he loves

Tebow, outspoken about his Christian faith both on and off the field, developed a national following before he ever entered the NFL. 

After spending a season and a half riding the bench for the Denver Brocos, he shocked the nation by leading them to two unlikely victories - including one in the playoffs - in 2011. 

His practice of 'Tebowing' - bowing his head in prayer after making touchdown passes - divided the nation. Millions of devoted fans praised him for not hiding his faith. 

However, Tebow's NFL prospects dimmed the next year when he saw little playing time for the New York Jets. In 2013, the New England Patriots invited him to training camp, but cut him before the season.

Tebow has since recast himself as a broadcast personality - relying on his good looks, easy smile and down-home charm.
