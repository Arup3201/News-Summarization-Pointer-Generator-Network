Police have offered to protect the 15-year-old bailed on suspision of starting the blaze at Manchester Dogs' home

A 15-year-old bailed on suspicion of torching Manchester Dogs' Home has been urged to move by police after being bombarded with death threats.

Police have offered to protect the teenager and his family amid growing concerns that they might be targeted in vigilante attacks following the blaze that claimed the lives of 60 animals.

As outrage grew over the suspected arson attack on Thursday night, the boy was named and pictured on Twitter and the threats began to pour in.

But the boy's defiant mother, 49, insisted they would not be forced out and said all the allegations were a 'pack of lies'.

She said: 'They have said that he has had to move away, that the police told him to go away for his own safety but as you can see he is still here. I don't care what people are saying about threats.

'I am still here and I'm not leaving. I don't want to talk about it because people will twist everything we say.'

It is not yet known whether the family have decided to leave the area for their own safety. 

But it has been revealed that the 15-year-old was attacked by a dangerously out-of-control Rhodesian ridgeback earlier this year.

He suffered serious injuries to his left arm in the attack and had to be treated in hospital.

A courageous neighbour used a kitchen knife to kill the dog and the owner was later prosecuted for allowing it to become out of control.

Police sources say the teenager vehemently denies setting fire to the kennels in Harpurhey on Thursday night.

It is understood he had to be restrained by police officers when he struggled with police in the cells while he was in custody.

The fire tore through the dog's home, killing more than 60 animals as hundreds of others yelped in their cages

He is due to return to a police station on Monday.

The youth is one of a handful police suspect may have played a role in the fire.

Senior officers have instigated a 'safeguarding plan' for the families of the suspect and other boys who are being questioned about the fire.

It could lead to those families being moved out of Harpurhey if they decide they want to leave the area.

The blaze destroyed much of the complex as fire crews and local people managed to rescue around 150 of the dogs, which had been locked into their kennels for the night.

More than £1.37million has now been donated to help rebuild the kennels.  

Police are thought to be concerned that assumptions have been made on the internet about a minor who may never be charged.

Some of the social media messages highlighted an alleged connection between Thursday's blaze and the earlier dog attack.

One person wrote: 'Was attacked by a dog… so thought it was ok to set Manchester Dogs' Home alight and murder 50+ dogs.'

Lisa Graham, manager of the stricken dogs' home, appealed for calm and for the police to be left to do their jobs. 'We don't want vigilantism,' she said. 'It's not going to do any good. We want to see justice, but for people to make death threats just isn't on.'

Three local men have been hailed as heroes after defying the flames to rescue animals during the blaze. Jason Dyer, 41, his son, Daniel Vere, 25, and nephew, Dean Rostock, 25, dragged about 20 dogs to safety between them, despite the danger.

In an outpouring of emotion across Britain, well-wishers have given £1.37million as well as donating  food, beds, and treats.

'We're going to have to rebuild, and that will be done on this site,' said Ms Graham. 'The kennels that burnt down were built in the 1980s, and since then there have been massive improvements in research and medical treatments.'

A vigil for the dogs that died in the fire will be held at the local Christ Church at 6pm tonight.

A couple set off to make a donation to survivors of the Manchester Dogs' Home fire yesterday – and ended up taking one of them home.

Company director Rick Yates, 31, and his girlfriend Chelsea Bond, 28, a solicitor, were moved almost to tears when they saw the tragedy unfold on television.

Yesterday they travelled to the kennels' sister home in Cheshire, determined to make a donation.

But then they saw Elsie, a ten-year-old mongrel, and couldn't resist her. Elsie had been lucky to survive the blaze after being moved from the worst-affected area the previous day.

'It was love at first sight,' said Mr Yates, of Newton-le-Willows, Merseyside. 'The plan was to give her a temporary home. But we're hoping it can become permanent as she seems such a lovely dog.'

The couple were among hundreds who turned out to the nearby Cheshire Dogs' Home in Grappenhall, near Warrington, to bring donations or offer to rehouse some of the survivors.

So many converged on the site that at one stage the nearby M6 was gridlocked.

Chelsea Bond and Rick Yates took Elsie home after visiting the kennel's sister home in Cheshire which is housing survivors of the tragedy
