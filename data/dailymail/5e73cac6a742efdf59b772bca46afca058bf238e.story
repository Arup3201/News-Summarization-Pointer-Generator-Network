The father of a British photographer wounded in the blast that killed Sunday Times photographer Marie Colvin has said his son 'doesn't want to leave her body behind'.

Paul Conroy, who suffered shrapnel injuries to a leg in a mortar attack, today appeared in a YouTube video saying he is 'absolutely OK' and being looked after by rebel fighters.

But despite appeals from two French journalists to be airlifted  immediately out of the country, his father Les has revealed his son is 'insisting he doesn't want to be moved out unless all of them can be taken out'.

He told the Liverpool ECHO: 'He doesn't want to leave Marie's body behind.'

Speaking on the video from a makeshift hospital bed, Devon-based father-of-three Paul, 47, who is believed to have been on assignment alongside Colvin, is seen asking British government agencies for assistance.

Paul, who grew up in Liverpool, tells the camera: 'I’m being looked after by the Free Syrian Army medical staff, who are treating me with the best medical treatment available.'

His video clip followed the pleas of two French journalists who are asking to be airlifted from Syria as quickly as possible.

French journalist Edith Bouvier's leg was badly broken in Wednesdays attack, which also killed photographer Remi Ochlik.

Le Figaro writer Ms Bouvier posted a video, alongside colleague William Daniels, asking for a temporary ceasefire so she can be taken out to receive treatment.

She said: 'I need to undergo surgery as soon as possible. The doctors have treated us very well here, and have done the best they could, but they are unable to perform surgery.'

The pleas came as government troops continued to shell rebel-held areas in central Syria today, killing at least five people.

They died in renewed shelling of the Baba Amr neighbourhood of Homs, the latest of hundreds killed there in recent weeks.

The neighbourhood, under siege and intense shelling for three weeks, has become the centre of the revolt.

The British-based Observatory for Human Rights said troops were also attempting to storm Rastan, a besieged rebel-held town just north of Homs.

Britain is to recognise the Syrian opposition as a 'legitimate representative' of the country's people, William Hague said today.

The Foreign Secretary made the comment as he arrived in Tunisia for talks on the response to brutal repression by Syrian president Bashar Assad's regime.

He said the international community had to 'tighten the diplomatic and economic stranglehold' on the Syrian government, amid growing concern over bloodshed in Homs and other cities.

He said: 'We will intensify our links with the opposition. I will meet leaders of the Syrian National Council in a few minutes' time, before the main meeting takes place.

'We, in common with other nations, will now treat them and recognise them as a legitimate representative of the Syrian people.'

Mr Hague denounced Assad's government as 'a criminal regime'. But he indicated that Britain is not contemplating sending arms to the Syrian opposition, as some people have demanded.

It said the town was being shelled and reported heavy clashes between troops and army defectors who destroyed two armoured personnel carriers.

The renewed violence comes as the United States, Europe and Arab nations meet in Tunisia to seek ways to ease the crisis.

More than 70 countries will participate in today's Friends of Syria meeting, which is expected to press Assad to agree to a ceasefire and allow humanitarian aid to reach the areas that have been hardest-hit by his security forces.

In the run up to the conference, American, European and Arab officials said the group would be likely to impose harsher sanctions if Assad rejects the ceasefire and predicted that his opponents would grow stronger if he remained in power.

Before the meeting, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton suggested Syria's opposition will ultimately arm itself and said she would bet against Assad staying in power.

She said: 'The strategy followed by the Syrians and their allies is one that can't stand the test of legitimacy or even brutality for any length of time.

'There will be increasingly capable opposition forces. They will from somewhere, somehow, find the means to defend themselves as well as begin offensive measures.

'It is clear to me there will be a breaking point. I wish it would be sooner, so that more lives would be saved, than later, but I have absolutely no doubt there will be such a breaking point.'

And in an effort to bring an end to the violence, the United Nations announced that former Secretary General Kofi Annan will be the joint UN-Arab League envoy to deal with the crisis.

Syrian forces have shot dead unarmed women and children, shelled residential areas and tortured wounded protesters in hospital under orders from the 'highest level' of army and government officials, the United Nations said yesterday.

Independent UN investigators called for perpetrators of such crimes against humanity to face prosecution and said they had drawn up a confidential list of names of commanding officers and officials alleged to be responsible.

The commission of inquiry, headed by Brazilian Paulo Pinheiro, found rebel forces led by the Free Syrian Army had also committed abuses including killings and abductions, 'although not comparable in scale'.

The report, which also said Syria is 'on the brink' of civil war, said: 'Army snipers and Shabbiha gunmen posted at strategic points terrorised the population, targeting and killing small children, women and other unarmed civilians.'

In a statement, Annan said he would try to 'help bring an end to the violence and human rights abuses, and promote a peaceful solution' in Syria.

He expressed hope the Syrian government and opposition groups will co-operate with him in his efforts.

The Tunisia meeting is the latest international effort to end the crisis, which began when protesters, inspired by the Arab Spring uprisings elsewhere, took to the streets in some of Syria's  impoverished provinces nearly a year ago to call for political change.

Since then, Assad's security forces have violently repressed the uprising, blaming it on Islamic extremists and armed gangs, while members of the originally peaceful opposition have taken up arms.

The UN estimated in January that 5,400 people had been killed in the conflict last year. Hundreds more have died since.

Syrian activists say the death toll is now more than 7,300. Overall figures cannot be independently confirmed because Syria has prevented most media from operating inside the country.

Also today, UN-appointed investigators in Geneva said they had compiled a list of Syrian officials accused of crimes against humanity in the crackdown. The list, it said, reaches as high as Assad.

Russia and China have long opposed foreign intervention in Syria.

Alexei Pushkov, a Russian lawmaker, said today after meeting Assad recently that the Syrian president sounded confident and demonstrated no sign he would step aside. And Pushkov warned that arming the Syrian opposition would fuel civil war.

'Assad doesn't look like a person ready to leave, because, among other things, there is no reason for him to do that as he is being supported by broad layers of the population,' Pushkov said, according to the RIA-Novosti news agency.
