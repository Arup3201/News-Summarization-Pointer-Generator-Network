An allegedly drunk NYPD officer was kicked off a bus as bemused fellow passengers watched and recorded the eight-minute incident on their mobile phones.

Sergeant Carlos Fabara was taken off the Greyhound bus in Philadelphia, which had passengers returning to New York City on Tuesday night.

Security guards and police handcuffed the off-duty police officer, who reportedly earns nearly $100,000, as they shouted: ‘Let’s go, let’s go now’.

Hands behind his back: Seven minutes into the altercation he was on his feet

Trouble: People on the Greyhound bus, who were delayed by around 30 minutes, called police to help the security guard take away Sergeant Fabara

Sergeant Fabara was in fact profiled four years ago as having 13 civilian complaints lodged against him as an NYPD cop in 2006.

This was a record for the department. Only around 10 per cent of officers get at least one complaint each year, reported the New York Daily News.

The driver tried his best to get the officer off the bus - full with passengers returning home after the Christmas weekend, reported the New York Post.

But the driver got so annoyed that he called security guards to take away the 14-year police veteran in handcuffs, passenger Geoff Parrish said.

Mr Parrish was one of several people who videoed the incident and put it on YouTube. Another passenger was seen recording events with his iPad.

'I’m not resisting'

People on the bus, who were delayed by around 30 minutes, called police to help the security guard take away Sergeant Fabara.

Passengers cheered as Sergeant Fabara was led out by the Philadelphia police officer, even as he insisted: ‘I’m not resisting’.

An NYPD spokesman told the New York Post its internal affairs department is investigating and confirmed the officer involved was Sergeant Fabara.

The department is also trying to work the identity of another officer who was seen with Sergeant Fabara in the video, first aired by Fox News.
