Killed: Mechanic Stephan Hollow (pictured) was named by his neighbours as the victim of the knife attack just yards from his doorstep.

A father was stabbed to death after rushing to the aid of his son, as an early morning argument spiralled into a murder.

Mechanic Stephan Hollow was named by his neighbours as the victim of the knife attack just yards from his doorstep.

It was understood that the 53-year-old had rushed to protect his son Tyler, known as 'Ty', 22 years, who suffered facial injuries in a row at their terraced house.

Mr Hollow, known as 'Steph', suffered multiple stab injuries and was rushed to hospital by land ambulance. Police said he died later in hospital.

Another man, 27, was arrested on suspicion of murder and was being quizzed by officers.

It was believed that Tyler suffered injuries to his face, but he did not require hospital treatment.

Today Detective Inspector Dave Storey of Hampshire said: 'This appears to have been an isolated incident between known parties.

'There has been a lot of police activity in the area this morning and we would like to thank residents for their co-operation and assistance while we carry out vital forensic examinations of the scene.

'There is no information to suggest a wider risk to the community from this crime.'

One neighbour told how there was a loud party at the house on Sunday evening before the tragedy unfolded in the early hours on this morning.

She said: 'There was a bit of a party going on in the back garden and they were all having a few drinks.

'From what I gather, one of Ty’s friends got into a fight with Steph and I saw them all outside with their tops off throwing a few punches.

'I heard Ty saying ‘look Dad let’s stop it’ and they all then went indoors. Then, half an hour later, as my other half was coming in I saw Ty pelt it out of the house and run up the road.

'I woke up at 6am to see all of the police tape around and heard Steph had been killed. It’s just awful. He is a mechanic and everyone knows him around here because of that.'

Investigation: Armed police raid at an address in Basingstoke, Hampshire in connection with the fatal stabbing of Stephan Hollow which took place in the early hours of this morning

Police had descended to the bloody death scene at Blackdown Close, Basingstoke, Hampshire.

Scenes of crimes officers were seen looking for clues in a car park at the back of the flats, which was cordoned off to the public.

There was blood on the floor next to a blue Suzuki jeep, which was towed away by police for analysis.

Armed police swooped on a house just five minutes walk from the murder scene at 6.30am, according to neighbours.

Officers
swamped Dorset Crescent bearing rifles and side arms and searched the 
property, where it was believed a mother and 18-year-old son live.

A neighbour, said: 'At 6.30am I opened my curtains to be greeted by loads of armed police.

'There were seven police cars and officers with rifles and hand guns outside the house across from us. They were looking for someone. They were in the house and in the cornfield opposite with dogs and guns.

'I
don’t know if anyone was arrested. I didn’t see if they got anyone. It 
was quite an alarming thing to see first thing in the morning.

Probe: A 27-year-old man is in police custody following the fatal attack. Police are pictured at a house nearby as their investigations continue today

'I know a mother and her teenage son live there but I don’t know them because they only moved in about six weeks ago.'

Today, a Hampshire Police spokesman said: 'We can confirm the victim is in his 50s and from Basingstoke. The arrested man is a 27-year-old from Basingstoke. He remains in police custody.'

A neighbour who knew Mr Hollow well said: 'He seemed like a nice guy. He would always have a chat with you. I never heard him say a bad word about anybody. I cannot believe that this sort of thing has happened. It seems so pointless.'

A young woman from the area said: 'His family are grieving. They are in shock.'

Tributes flooded into Facebook as news of the tragic death spread.

Marie Perry wrote: 'Lovely guy brilliant smile, our love and thoughts are with you all right now.'

Meanwhile, Ryan Houston wrote: 'So sorry to hear the tragic news. Our thoughts are with you all.'

Mr Hollow’s son Anthony Hollow wrote simply: 'Love you dad xx'

A friend, Sean Keen, wrote on Twitter: 'RIP to steph no one deserves what happened thoughts with all the family xx.'
