Winter may not be too far off, but the autumn heatwave across Australia's east coast is only just finishing up in some cities while Sydney shows no signs of slowing down.

Reaching a top of 23 degrees, Saturday was the fifteenth consecutive day in a row that the average temperature for May - 22 degrees - has been exceeded in Sydney.

Melbourne has also smashed records set in the same month of 1972 this week, recording 12 consecutive days of temperatures reaching above 20 degrees, before slumping back down again on Saturday.

In the south, Adelaide matched some of its best records since May in 1918 this month, when Thursday became the 10th consecutive day of 22 degrees or more in May, which usually has an average maximum of less than 19 degrees.

A heatwave has been warming the streets of Sydney for the last two weeks while breaking records as the longest recorded since 1910

The summer of 2013/2014 also broke a number of records across the country for high maximum temperatures recorded, according to the Climate Council's Angry Summer report

Adelaide also recorded its hottest temperature in the month before winter since more than a century ago, when it reached 27.4 degrees on May 16.

Even Hobart recorded a record breaking 23.9 degrees last Thursday as high-pressure systems pushed cold fronts further south than usual.

The extended heatwaves come just after the most recent summer of 2013/2014, broke records across the country with the consistently high maximum temperatures recorded.

Heatwaves are considered to occur when temperatures reach a high maximum and minimum which are unusual for the location for at least three days in a row, according to the Australian Bureau of Meteorology.

Melbourne also recorded a hotter than ever month of May with 12 consecutive days of temperatures reaching above 20 degrees

Adelaide had its hottest temperature in May in more than a century on the 16th at 27.4 degrees

But although Melbourne and South Australia have dropped back to cooler average temperatures, Sydney shows no sign of dropping down, with the last fortnight setting a record for Australia's major city, as the last longest recorded heatwave since 1910 which only lasted for seven days in August of 1995, according to Scorcher.

The Harbour City's record for the average maximum temperature for the month of May is also predicted to be broken in 2014, which was set at 22.7 degrees in 1958.

The above average temperatures are only set to continue for the next week or so.

The current heatwave is expected to continue, with the State of the Climate 2014 report stating that the duration, frequency and intensity of heatwaves have been on the increase across Australia since the 1950s

The city's beach-goers are certainly happy about the warmer weather, with water temperatures reaching almost 23 degrees at Bondi on Saturday

But the rise in heatwaves is no surprise for some, with the State of the Climate 2014 report, compiled by The Bureau of Meteorology and CSIRO, claiming that duration, frequency and intensity of heatwaves have increased across Australia long since the 1950s.

Eastern Australia in particular, has been subject to an increase in these weather conditions.

But despite presenting the best opportunity for beach-goers, with water temperatures reaching almost 23 degrees at Bondi, an increase in the amount and duration of heatwaves presents many concerns.

Heatwaves have so far killed more people than any other natural disaster, including bushfires in the last 200 years.

Although providing appealing weather for Sydney-siders this weekend, the long term hazards of heatwaves are severe with the weather event causing more deaths than any natural disaster across the country,

Heatwaves also have adverse affects for wildlife and agriculture as well as causing damage to infrastructure such as transport and electricity systems

The the dry conditions also mean that the area's affected are subject to drier conditions for longer periods, increasing the risk of fires and essentially leading to a potentially longer fire season.

Farmers and further down the track, consumers can also be badly affected by agricultural losses from heatwaves as particular crops require certain temperature thresholds to grow plentifully.

Australian fauna are also at risk as heatwaves continue to rage, with flying foxes, birds and marsupials particularly vulnerable.

The Climate Council's Angry Summer report lists a range of additional problems related to heatwaves, surprisingly including a reduction in workplace productivity and damage of infrastructure such as transport and electricity systems.
