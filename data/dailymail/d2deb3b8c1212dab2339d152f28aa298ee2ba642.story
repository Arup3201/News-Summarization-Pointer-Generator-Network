Happy couple: The Governor's Wife will follow the lives of ex-Louisiana Governor Edwin Edwards, 86, and his wife Trina Scott Edwards, 35

Edwin Edwards is the former governor of Louisiana, infamous for serving an 8½ year prison sentence for bribery and extortion. Having just celebrated his 86th birthday alongside his 35-year-old wife, Trina, Edwin remains a respected and beloved figure in Louisiana's colorful culture.This powerful and legendary figure in Louisiana politics just wants to kick back and make his wife happy.

Trina Edwards is a young, fun and beautiful 35-year-old woman best known as Edwin Edward's third wife. After reading his biography while he was incarcerated, she initiated a pen pal relationship with Edwin while he was in jail, which quickly turned romantic. Married a year after Edwin was released from prison, the newly minted 'Mrs. Edwards' works hard to rehabilitate her gold-digger reputation and cement her place on the social scene, much to the dismay of her stepdaughters, who are almost twice her age.

Their show was originally set to debut this February, but was delayed 'due to new events in the family's lives.'

The show aims to exploit the drama of the blended family and showcase how Edwards is picking up the pieces from the political shenanigans that landed him in prison.

The disgraced Democrat served four terms as Governor of the Bayou State and also served in Congress.

He was known for his charisma in politics but was sentenced to prison on racketeering charges in 2001.

He was in jail from 2002 to January 2011 for his role in a bribery and extortion scheme to rig riverboat casino licenses during his fourth term in the early 1990s.

Charismatic: Edwin Edwards, who met Trina Grimes Scott during his time in prison, has said 'A man is only as old as the woman he feels'

Captivating: Trina began writing to Edwin while he was in prison who then arranged for her to visit him

What a couple! The pair married in July 2011 and now have a 3-month old baby

Trina, who was in school at the time, picked up a copy of Leo Honeycutt’s biography of the former governor and became fascinated with her future husband’s story.

She began writing to Edwin who then arranged for her to visit him in prison.

Edwards explained how they met in an interview with Fox411. 'I was in the last year of my prison term…and after she read the book, she became interested in my career and asked to visit me. And I arranged for her to visit me and after that we got to know each other well and she came to visit me every visiting day thereafter.

'And that’s an unusual story for a man my age and a beautiful young woman her age,' Edwards continued. 'But thank goodness it happened. They sent me to prison for life, look what I came back, a good-looking wife.'

May-December romance: The love match began when he was in prison and she was his pen pal

Characters: The reality show featured Mr. Edwards. His daughters (center) Anna and Victoria are prominent along with Trina's two teenage boys (right)

Required viewing: Mr. Edwards is the star, but the story is told from Trina¿s point of view. She has two teenage sons from a previous marriage, but finds herself treated like a wayward child by her stepdaughters

First episode: Viewers see Trina's desire to get pregnant (she also has two teenage sons from a previous marriage). Edwin apparently had his sperm frozen over twenty years ago, a fact that Trina was thrilled to learn

Both Trina and Edwin admit their story is 'unique,' but insist their relationship works for them.

'My husband is an amazing husband,' Trina Edwards said. 'He’s a wonderful father. Our marriage is better than most people’s marriage when they’re the same age.'

'I don’t know how it happened or why it happened but I absolutely fell in love with him,” Trina said. “And besides that, he doesn’t have as much money as most people think. So I’d be a pretty poor gold digger if that’s what I was in for.'

Trina Scott married Edwin Edwards in July 2011. She is Edwards' third wife. They welcomed a son, Eli, this August.

The Governor's Wife: Another A&E reality show featuring real life people in strange circumstances

Odd beginnings: The love match began when he was in prison and she was his pen pal

The show will focus on how Trina Edwards tries to fit into her husband's upscale world while trying to corral her two teenage sons, including Trevor, left

The show gets interesting in the dynamic between Edwards' other children.

He has four children by his first 
wife Elaine. Two of his daughters Anna and Victoria (who are now in 
their 60s), will appear on the show.

Anna is a 63-year-old, four-time divorcee, and Victoria is described as 'a hardened 60-year-old ex-showgirl.'

Scott also has two teenage boys, Trevor and Logan, from a previous marriage who will also be included in the reality program.

'People are going to be surprised at how normal in most respects our lives are,' the former Governor said.

'And given, in spite of the fact that 
there’s this great difference in our age, the fact that I have 4 
children over 55-years-old and now a 3-month-old baby and she’s got two 
teenage boys. A situation that the average person, not knowing or having
 been with us would raise his or her eyebrows and say that’s never going
 to work but believe me it has worked and I’m very proud of it.'

The Season Premiere is on A&E, Sunday, October 27 | 10/9C

Colorful past: Edwards had a long and colorful political career that ended with a 10-year jail sentence for bribery, extortion and other charges while in office
