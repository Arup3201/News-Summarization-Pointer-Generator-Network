Proud father Prince William is determined his baby son George will be a devoted Aston Villa fan like him.

He has vowed to take the little prince to watch his team at Villa Park in a video message released today to mark the 150th anniversary of the Football Assocaition.

The Duke of Cambridge spoke about sitting with George - christened on Wednesday - as the claret and blues 'thrash' Premier League champions Manchester United.

In the video, William smiled as he said: 'When Villa thrash Man U at Villa Park, my son will be there.'

The royal also joked about his anxieties ahead of a competitive football match that was staged at Buckingham Palace earlier this month, hinting at worries the Queen's garden might have turned into a bog.

Speaking about his role as FA 
president, William said: 'I've always loved football since I was a 
young boy. I've never got any better at it, but I keep saying to myself,
'If you keep trying, eventually something will happen'.

'It's
always meant a great deal to me being president of the FA. There's a 
lot of good that football can do around the world, and in this country.Â

'But
globally it is a huge force for good and a lot of people love, respect 
and enjoy their football more than anything else in their lives.

'Being
president of an organisation that can reach that many people and can 
affect a lot of lives through sport, I think is hugely important.'

William added: 
'It's extremely important to me that grassroots football is acknowledged
in the FA's 150th year and without it there wouldn't be any Premiership
players who are worth supporting, watching or being such successful 
players that they are.'

The royal's video message is released exactly 150 years since the FA was founded.

William will attend a FA gala dinner tonight to mark the anniversary, with the event staged at the Grand Connaught Rooms in London - the site where the founder fathers of English football met in 1863.

The video will by played during the dinner and William is due to give a speech.

William helped organise the competitive game at Buckingham Palace between two of England's oldest amateur clubs, Civil Service FC and Polytechnic FC, as part of the anniversary celebrations.

Speaking about the Queen, the Duke said: 'She was extremely supportive, but there was a little bit of a sweating moment for me having to ask her, with the possibility that her lawn might turn into a massive quagmire.

'It was a little bit awkward but thankfully the weather held off.'
