A campaign to plant millions of poppies to mark the centenary of the First World War will go ahead after all – despite being denied Lottery cash.

The local scheme proposed by two Kent branches of the Royal British Legion has been rescued by DIY chain B&Q – and now becomes a national project.

The Centenary Poppy Campaign will launch next month in a bid to encourage the public, local authorities, schools and businesses to sow millions of seeds across Britain.

Organisers said they were ‘over the moon’ at winning backing for the plan, which was endorsed by Prince Charles and David Cameron as a fitting way to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the outbreak of war in 2014.

The award follows the lottery fund's refusal to fund a £92,200 Royal British Legion scheme to help children seed millions of poppies

It was plunged into crisis on Tuesday 
when the Heritage Lottery Fund denied the Legion’s Greenhithe and 
Swanscombe branches a £92,200 grant because of a ‘high level of demand’ 
for money.

The decision sparked outrage by former military chiefs and MPs and the issue was raised in Parliament.

Lord Guthrie, a former chief of the defence staff, said: ‘It is quite a strange decision and a very unfortunate one.’

While
 the poppy appeal was rejected, £100,000 was given this week to the 
Peace Pledge Union, a pacifist group that wants to raise awareness of 
the role of conscientious objectors during the 1914-18 war.

Dartford MP Gareth Johnson, left, who had been supporting the project, condemned the decision last night. Prime Minister David Cameron, right, had singled the scheme out for praise

The
 RBL’s director of fundraising, Charles Byrne, said: 'The Royal British 
Legion is pleased to confirm we are rolling out the Centenary Poppy 
Campaign, which originated in the Greenhithe and Swanscombe Branch of 
the Legion, UK-wide, and plans for the campaign including a partnership 
with a national retailer will be announced imminently.

'The
 bid submitted to the Heritage Lottery Fund by the Greenhithe and 
Swanscombe Branch of The Royal British Legion was for a local project to
 provide poppy seeds in the Kent area only.

'The Legion is now working with the branch and the HLF on a renewed bid to enable the local project to go ahead.'

Conservative
 MP for Dartford Gareth Johnson, whose great-grandfather died in the 
war, condemned the HLF’s position, telling the House of Commons: 'This 
project has received support from Prince Charles and numerous charities 
and respected organisations.

'It was therefore surprising that the 
Heritage Lottery Fund failed to support this project when it came before
 them last month.

Culture
 Minister Hugh Robertson, replying to Mr Johnson, said: 'I would 
absolutely agree with you that if there is one thing that is synonymous 
with memories of the First World War it is the Flanders Poppy. That’s 
one of the reasons why I think this was such a clever idea.

Mr Robertson said ministers are not allowed to direct lottery distributors over how to spend money.

Some
 of the bloodiest fighting of the First World War took place in the 
Flanders and Picardy regions of Belgium and Northern France.

The
 poppy is considered an important symbol of the conflict because it was 
the only thing which grew in the aftermath of the complete devastation.

A Heritage 
Lottery Fund spokesman said: 'The Heritage Lottery Fund has been unable 
to support a grant application from the Greenhithe and Swanscombe Branch
 of the Royal British Legion for a Kent-based project to sow poppies 
across the county, not to be confused with the Legion’s proposed UK-wide
 Centenary Poppy Campaign.

'Demand
 for our funds is high and we are unfortunately unable to support every 
application.  We remain deeply committed to helping people to learn 
about and tell the stories of the First World War, and have already 
invested more than £28million into projects marking the Centenary. 

'We
 are in discussion with the Royal British Legion at national level and 
will be meeting with representatives from the Greenhithe and Swanscombe 
Branch of the RBL next week.'
