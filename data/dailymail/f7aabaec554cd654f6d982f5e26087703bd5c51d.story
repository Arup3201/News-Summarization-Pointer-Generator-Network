Boris Johnson today promised to be blasted with a water cannon to prove they are safe, after he ordered three to use on the streets of London.

The London Mayor went ahead with the order without Home Secretary Theresa May sanctioning their use, fuelling tensions between the senior Tories. 

Challenged on the radio to face a cannon himself, Mr Johnson said: 'Man or mouse. Alright, you've challenged me to this. I suppose I'm going to have to do it now.'

Mr Johnson claimed that by spending £130,000 on buying, refitting and transporting three second-hand vehicles from German police now, before they are approved for use, he will save Londoners £2.4 million in the long term.

Challenged on LBC radio by interviewer Nick Ferrari to be filmed standing in front of the water cannon, Mr Johnson initially seemed reluctant, telling him:

'I'm certainly prepared to do anything to show that they're safe within reason. I'm not quite sure whether I want to stand in front of a water cannon, I haven't done anything to deserve it.'

But after a few moments' consideration, he came round to the idea, telling Ferrari: 'OK. Man or mouse. Alright, you've challenged me to this. I suppose I'm going to have to do it now.

'I'm doing this unfortunately from off-base, so I can see all my poor press people are going to be tearing their hair out. Never mind, it's got to be done. Thanks for that one, Ferrari!'

Mr Ferrari suggested that he and the Mayor could stand in front of the cannon together, wearing bright yellow fishermen's oilskin and sou'wester to protect them from the water.

Water 
cannon have been allowed in Northern Ireland since the Troubles but 
cannot be deployed in England and Wales without Mrs May’s approval. 

Mr Johnson and Mrs May are seen as candidates to succeed David Cameron if he fails to achieve a majority at next year’s General Election and stands aside.

Sources at Mr Johnson’s City Hall headquarters told The Times that the Mayor was ‘frustrated’ at the lack of decision-making by the Home Office. One said: ‘Boris is the mayor, policing in London is his responsibility, this is his money and he is of the view that this is what is needed.

‘The Metropolitan Police have been asking for water cannon since the riots of August 2011.’

Sources close to Mr Johnson also say that he largely ignores Mrs May  to the point ‘he almost never  mentions her’.

Rivals: Theresa May has not yet sanctioned the use of water cannon and the action by the Mayor of London will be seen as a challenge to her authority in the wake of the 'Trojan Horse' row over Islamic extremism in schools

The police are allowed to use water cannons on the streets of Northern Ireland and have done so on several occasions

 

A 
document from the Mayor’s Office for Policing and Crime said: ‘While it 
was the original intention to wait for the Home Secretary to take a 
decision to authorise the use of water cannon, this process is proving 
time consuming.’

Mrs May, 
who has overtaken Mr Johnson in recent months as the clear favourite to 
succeed Mr Cameron, is known to regard the Mayor as a ‘faintly 
ridiculous’ figure. Mr Johnson’s apparent challenge  follows claims that
 the recent spat between the Mrs May and Education Secretary Michael 
Gove was partly fuelled by rivalry for the Tory leadership.

Of the three water cannons, two will work in tandem while a third is held in reserve

Senior Met officers want to buy three 23-year-old German water cannon for around £30,435 each before the summer.

The vehicles carry up to 2,000 gallons of water and can travel at speeds comparable to an HGV.

Up to £130,000 will need to be spent to convert the machines, buy additional equipment and train officers to work alongside them.

Water in the vehicles’ tanks is heated to 41F (5C) to prevent the ‘onset of medical conditions associated with the shock of being exposed to cold water’.

They can be refilled from hydrants or open water and two machines must be used in tandem as a third is kept in reserve.

A report revealed by the Government’s Defence Science and Technology Laboratory found there was ‘good evidence’ that their use had led to serious injuries.

Baroness 
Jenny Jones, who sits on a body which scrutinises the Met Police, said 
Mr Johnson may be ‘over confident’ in buying the machines.

She said: ‘It is a possible waste of taxpayers’ money at a time when the Met is struggling to keep officers on the frontline.

‘It is 
also ignoring the views of the vast majority of Londoners who don’t want
 water cannon, think they will suppress legitimate protest or are a 
distraction from the police’s main role.

‘We’ve 
heard that water cannon would have been useless in the riots, so what 
exactly will they be for? It’s just another big boy’s toy that we can’t 
afford.’ Earlier this year, Mr Johnson urged police to get ‘medieval’ on
 rioters as he threw his weight behind proposals to buy water cannon.

He said 
police must never again be left powerless in the face of overwhelming 
violence like that seen during the 2011 riots. But he stressed the 
chances of the machines being used in the capital, or other mainland 
cities, remained ‘vanishingly rare’.

Police 
argue water cannon would be useful in a static confrontation where there
 is a need to create space between police lines and violent crowds.

They said 
it could have helped protect firefighters and paramedics after shops 
were set ablaze as rioting spread to Croydon in 2011.
