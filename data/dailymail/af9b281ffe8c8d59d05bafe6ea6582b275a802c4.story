Rio Fedinand has sought to move on from his Manchester United days after putting his seven-bedroom mansion on the market.

The 35-year-old saw his contract run down at Old Trafford, and is set to join QPR this summer.

And his Cheshire home - which he purchased upon moving to the area in 2003 - is now up for sale at £4.5million according to The Sun.

Ever the fitness enthusiast, the Alderley Edge 1.5-acre property also includes an indoor pool and two gyms.

Newly-promoted QPR have agreed terms with the centre-back, according to manager Harry Redknapp.

'Rio has agreed to join us and we’re hopeful of getting that one over the line when he gets back from the World Cup,' Redknapp told the Daily Telegraph.

'I can’t foresee any problems with it and we’d be delighted if we can get it done soon. He's been a player at the top of the list since he left Manchester United and he would give the whole place a lift with his quality and experience.'
