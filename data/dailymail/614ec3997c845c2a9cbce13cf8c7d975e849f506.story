She told Valley News Live: ‘I can't stop. I'm trusting God.’

Mrs Nagbe moved to Lisbon from Liberia for a better life and now feels disillusioned.

She added: ‘In the United States it's one nation under God.’

The police remain adamant that she was causing a nuisance, with Police Chief Jeanette Persons stating that the problem wasn’t the praying, but the volume of her voice.

She said: ‘I mean, we all need prayers and great she's out there praying for all of us, but it's just the volume of her voice.’

Chief Persons added that Mrs Nagbe would linger outside people’s homes shouting.

Pastor Juwle Nagbe said he was upset that his wife was being made to look like a bad person and urged officials to treat her with respect.
