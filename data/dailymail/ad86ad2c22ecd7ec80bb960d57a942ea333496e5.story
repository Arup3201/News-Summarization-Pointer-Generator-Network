A half ton shipment of radioactive sanitary products has been discovered by customs officials at a Lebanon airport.

Around 30 crates of feminine hygiene products were seized Friday at Rafik Hariri International Airport in Beirut after electronic scanners detected radioactivity in the shipment.

Tests revealed the shipment, which weighed 554 kilograms, had more than 35 times the safe levels of radioactivity.

The sanitary pads had originated in China, and arrived at the airport Friday from Dubai, officials said.

After  failing to pass the radioactivity scanner test at the airport, the shipment's contents were examined at the Lebanese Atomic Energy Commission 

The Lebanon Minister for Finance, the department which is responsible for customs, told Al-Joumhouriya newspaper: 'As a result of the examination of a number of boxes that contained sanitary pads, it appeared that the rate of radioactivity inside them was 35 times more than is permitted.'

The sanitary towels were manufactured by Anion which purports the health benefits of anions- groups of negatively charged ionized atoms.

It is not known, but it may be possible the source of the radiation came from the production process.

Ionization happens when atoms are given high-energy ionizing radiation, electrical voltage or high temperature.

Atomic nuclei that have been completely ionized are called charged particles and are also radioactive. 

On the company website, Anions claim their pads and pantyliners contain an anion layer which 'emits intensive anion stream beneficial to human health in amount up to 5800 for cm3.'

They go onto claims that anions are 'air vitamins' and 'significantly benefit to human health and daily routine' boosting the respiratory, cardiovascular, nervous and immune systems.

 A specialized judiciary launched an investigation into the case.

The discovery was the latest in a series of radioactive finds at Beirut's airport and sea port amid an ongoing crackdown on radioactive imports. 

Last month, the Khalil ordered the Customs Department at the same airport to send back a shipment of 98 mobile phone covers from China that were revealed to be radioactive.
