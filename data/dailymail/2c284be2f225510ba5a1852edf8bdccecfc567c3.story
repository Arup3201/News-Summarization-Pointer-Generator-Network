But he didn't count on the rat terrier's fierce protection. 

'The victim’s dog bit at his ankle causing him to release her,' said Cobb County Police Sgt. Dana Pierce, Yahoo reports. 'It was at that moment that the victim was able to get away from him.'

Because the man was after children so close to the school, authorities say it is extremely important to find him.

'There’s always children going up and down this street without parents or anything, and it’s really scary that it’s happening like that,' said neighbor Rebecca Walker.

The man is said to be middle-aged with a medium build, standing about 5 foot ten. He was wearing a royal blue hoodie and dark cap bearing a green symbol, WSB Radio reports.

While the man is still at-large, the Jones family at least knows they have one dog they can rely on.

'My hero,' Jones told reporters. 'My daughter's hero.'
