Roma's season went from bad to worse after losing 2-0 at home to Sampdoria on Monday to leave Rudi Garcia's team in danger of losing out on second place in Serie A after Lazio won 2-0 at Torino.

Lorenzo De Silvestri and substitute Luis Muriel scored to inflict Roma's first home league loss of the season amid loud jeers at the Stadio Olimpico, and the hosts' misery was compounded by Seydou Keita's late red card.

Roma had started the year battling with Juventus for the title but Garcia's side have now fallen 14 points behind the defending champions.

Roma were looking to get back to winning ways after five successive league draws at home and things looked promising in the first half as Sampdoria goalkeeper Emiliano Viviano was forced into a series of fine saves to keep the home side at bay.

The visitors took the lead against the run of play on the hour mark when Samuel Eto'o held off two Roma players to pull back from the byline for De Silvestri and the former Lazio defender fired into the bottom right corner.

Muriel doubled Samp's lead in the 78th, four minutes after coming off the bench. He sped forward and his initial effort came off the post but Roma failed to clear and Muriel hit the target at the second time of asking.

There was more misery for Roma as Keita was cautioned and then immediately shown a second yellow card and sent off after sarcastically applauding the referee.

The midfielder was distraught and his team-mates struggled to get him off the pitch.
