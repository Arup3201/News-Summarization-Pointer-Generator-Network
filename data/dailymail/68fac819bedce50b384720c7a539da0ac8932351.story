Roger Goodell says London’s response to the NFL is ‘better than we ever dreamed’ - but stopped short of saying a franchise will be moving across the Atlantic.

At his annual ‘State of the NFL’ address, the 55-year-old commissioner twice dodged a definitive answer to the question.

NFL commissioner Roger Goodell said London games had exceeded all expectations

‘London has done not only everything that we expected but more than we expected, they are responding to the game better than we ever dreamed with more enthusiasm, more passion,’ he said.

‘You see it every year, the passion, the understanding of the game, every event that we have explodes with interest,’ he added.

‘We are continuing to advance our interests over there from the standpoint of playing more games.’ said Goodell.

‘The passion is obvious, we want to continue to respond to that fan interest and if we do - we don’t know where it will go but there is great potential in London for the NFL.’

During his 45 minute address, Goodell faced a wide range of questions and admitted he has not given a thought to resigning despite a ‘tough year’ for the NFL.

The 55-year-old has attracted criticism in many quarters for his handled of the Ray Rice and Adrian Peterson cases.

Goodell promised that the league will also undergo a ‘serious’ and ‘thorough’ review of the Deflategate saga.

When asked if he will give an apology to New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft if the Patriots are cleared of wrongdoing, Goodell replied: ‘This my job. This is my responsibility, to protect the integrity of this game. I represent 32 teams.’

Seahawks running back Marshawn Lynch could face fine for wearing ‘Beast Mode’ cap

The NFL will decide on the response to Seattle Seahawks running back Marshawn Lynch wearing non-licences ‘Beast Mode’ cap during media appearances after Super Bowl.

And Goodell responded to Lynch’s handling of media duties this week.

‘It’s part of your job,’ Goodell said. ‘There are things in your job that you might not necessarily want to do. I think Marshawn understands the importance of the Super Bowl and the importance of his appearance in the Super Bowl.’
