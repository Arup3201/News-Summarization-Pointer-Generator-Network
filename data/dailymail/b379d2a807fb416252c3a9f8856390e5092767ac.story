Speaking out: Liverpool University vice-chancellor Professor Sir Howard Newby said the issue was an 'unintended consequence' of the sector's overhaul

Thousands of places at top universities were left unfilled this year as a result of the Government’s higher education reforms, a leading academic said yesterday.

The 11,500 lost places were an ‘unintended consequence’ of  the overhaul of the sector, according to Professor Sir Howard Newby, vice-chancellor of Liverpool University.

And he warned that the same situation could happen next year.

‘One of the startling unintended 
consequences is that currently, this year, there are about 11,500 empty 
places in Russell Group universities,’ he said at the Girls’ Schools 
Association conference.

He said the reasons for the empty 
places were the ‘downward pressure’ on A-level grades that meant there 
were not so many students around to recruit, and there was ‘some 
slacking of demand in certain subjects, mainly humanities and social 
sciences’.

Under the Government’s higher 
education reforms, this year universities were free to recruit as many 
students with at least two As and a B at A-level as they wanted.

The Russell Group, which includes 
Oxford and Cambridge as well as other institutions  such as Warwick, 
Durham, Bristol and Edinburgh, generally ask prospective students for 
higher grades, and are charging up to the maximum £9,000 a year in fees.

Speaking after the conference in 
Liverpool last night, Sir Howard said that in general Russell Group 
universities had smaller allocations to recruit students with less than 
AAB.

There were also fewer students achieving A grades at A-level, with fewer students applying for degree courses.

Next year, ministers have said that universities will be free to recruit as many students with an A and two Bs as they like.

But Sir Howard said: ‘We believe, in the Russell Group certainly, we could have a  further round of empty places next year.’

It is not known where the empty places are within the Russell Group’s 24 institutions, or if they are spread out evenly.

Hilary French, head of Central 
Newcastle High School and president elect of the Girls’ School 
Association said: ‘It seems to be ludicrous.

‘Our girls got places, but to think there are places sitting there and there were people who would have taken those places.’

She suggested that Russell Group universities should have made their unfilled places available through clearing.

The Government partially lifted the 
strict cap on student numbers this year, allowing universities to admit 
unlimited numbers of students with AAB grades.

However, universities are
not currently allowed to fill AAB places with students with lower 
grades.

Slacking of demand in humanities and social sciences was also to blame
