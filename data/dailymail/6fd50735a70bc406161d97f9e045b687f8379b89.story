'It means everything to me,' said Barkley. 'It's a dream playing for Everton. As soon as I got told about it I wanted to sign.'

'I've played for Everton most of my life. This is a big thing for me.

'I realise the importance of signing because I remember how I felt when Wayne (Rooney) left.

'He was one of the best players in the team and we thought we could push on with him at Everton. When he left we were all down as Evertonians.'

And Martinez added: 'Ross has signed a new contract to reflect his new role and development.

'When you talk about assembling squads and getting ready for the new seasons for us it is as big news as you can get.

'Ross is still a young man and there is a long way to go in his development but as it stands he is a massive part of our squad.

'It is a big moment as every Evertonian will tell you Ross Barkley is the sort of player everyone would love to pay to watch him play.

'He brings back memories of the big legends we've had at the club. But saying that he is a young man and his best years are yet to come.'

Barkley made his Premier League debut for Everton in 2011 under David Moyes, and made sporadic appearances for the club over the next couple of seasons.

He then spent the majority of the 2012/13 campaign on loan in the Championship, scoring four times in 13 games for Sheffield Wednesday, before a later short stint at Leeds United.

His breakthrough season, however, came last time out under new boss Martinez, when he appeared in 34 games for Everton in the Premier League, scoring six times in the process.

Then, against Moldova at Wembley in September 2013, he made his England debut as a second half substitute in a 4-0 victory, and has since gone on to appear for his national team a further eight times.

And three of those appearances came during England's disappointing World Cup campaign, where he came off the bench in both defeats against Italy and Uruguay, before starting the 0-0 draw in their final group game against Costa Rica.
