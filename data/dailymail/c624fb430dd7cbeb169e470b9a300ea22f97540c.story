Her snow white skin has been iconic for centuries.

But it seems Queen Elizabeth I may not have been the pale and interesting poster girl history dictates.

Microscopic analysis of one portrait has revealed she had blushing cheeks blotted with rouge.

And our perception of the monarch as austere comes after her numerous portraits have faded, losing their subtle pink touches, National Portrait Gallery scientists claim.

During Elizabethan times, women went to great lengths to maintain smooth, pale skin - a sign of wealth and high class.

Tanned skin, blemishes, sunburn, or freckles were reserved for lower ranking members of society who toiled on the land, while the upper classes relaxed indoors.

Pioneering the style, the Queen took great care to maintain smooth, pale skin.

She painted her face and neck with ceruse - an ointment of white lead and vinegar - to cover the scars left by an attack of smallpox at the age of 29.

Only the very wealthy could afford the solution, which was very bad for her health as it slowly poisoned her body and impacted her skin problems.

For many, the severity of the white has been taken as a symbol of Elizabeth's strong, unemotional persona.

Despite reportedly having numerous suitors, she painted herself as the Virgin Queen who would never marry.

But the rosy colour on her cheeks - detected by scientists at the National Portrait Gallery - suggests a more bashful and flirtatious side to the monarch.

On her lips, she applied red.

With poor dental care in the period, the monarch was forced to have many teeth removed as she aged.

Queen Elizabeth I is widely believed to have mixed red dye with mercuric sulphide for her red lips - and possibly her rosy cheeks.

It was dabbed on after she pasted white lead and vinegar over her face and neck.

Kohl, a black lead sulphide, was used to outline her eyes to make them appear whiter and brighter - a trick still in vogue today.

She plucked her hair line back by about an inch to increase the size of her forehead, and also plucked her eyebrows to make them appear more arched and fair.

With poor dental care, she was forced to have teeth removed - which she hid by stuffing rags in the gaps.

To hide the appearance of hollow cheeks - caused by the loss of teeth - she reportedly stuffed rags in her mouth.

Arched brows and a high hairline were also in vogue, and Elizabeth - like many others at the time - plucked her hair daily. Emphasising the look, she wore a wig which pulled her hairline back.

Kohl was used to outline the eyes, making the whites seem brighter.

Deconstructing the Queen's exhaustive make up routine, scientific analysis of her portraits will be displayed in a major exhibition at the National Portrait Gallery this year.

Following seven years of research, it will hang alongside many other art works, diaries and jewellery from the Tudor dynasty, which have also been examined.

The project, which involved the use of Xâ€“rays, infrared reflectography and pigment analysis, included the gallery's oldest portrait of Henry VII.

Five paintings of Mary I are to go on display, with her prayer book, on loan from Westminster Cathedral.

Elizabeth I's locket ring, borrowed from its home at Chequers, will also be exhibited.

Dr Tarnya Cooper, the chief curator of the National Portrait Gallery, said: 'This special display will bring together some of the most important portraits of all the Tudor monarchs, revealing how paintings were made and changed at later dates.'

The Real Tudors: Kings and Queens Rediscovered will open on Sept 11.
