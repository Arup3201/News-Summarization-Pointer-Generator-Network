Hundreds of glowing tents have sprung at various sites around the British coast as part of groundbreaking art project for the London 2012 Festival.

Peace Camp, which was commissioned by director Deborah Warner in collaboration with True Blood actress Fiona Shaw is a series of installations inspired by the United Nations Olympic Truce, which calls on countries worldwide to lay down their arms for the duration of the Games.

Some of the most breathtaking coastal regions in the UK have been chosen for the camps including Cemaes Bay in Anglesey, White Park Bay in County Antrim, Mussenden Temple and Downhill Demesne in County Londonderry, Dustanburgh Castle in Northumberland, Cuckmere Haven near Seven Sisters in Sussex and Godrevy, Cornwall.

Peace and love: A couple embrace in the White Park Bay installation. The Olympic Truce is believed to have been first established in ancient Greece so that the Games be held without warring factions seeking to take advantage

The Olympic Truce is believed to have been first established in ancient Greece so that the Games be held without warring factions seeking to take advantage.Â 

Visitors to the sites can wander 
around the tents while hearing a soundscape of poetry and the natural 
environment created by composer Mel Mercier and sound designer John Del'
Nero.

Alongside the live installations, the 
project will also paint an audible portrait of the nation with the 
creation of a virtual Peace Camp online.

The people of the UK are invited to 
nominate and record their favourite love poems and submit their own 
messages, creating an online anthology that celebrates our languages, 
dialects and accents as well as our rich poetic tradition.

There are lots of ways to take part in
Peace Camp: you can suggest your favourite love poem for our online 
anthology; upload a personal message, your own poem or an image inspired
by love and help us to create a portrait of love in 2012 that will be 
archived by the British Library; or you can join the team and volunteer 
at the live event.

As well as collaborating with Deborah 
Warner on the live installations, Fiona Shaw will be creating the Peace 
Camp anthology, an online collection of love poems suggested by the 
public in this Olympic year.

White Park Bay is the site of the earliest settlements in Ireland, with evidence of Neolithic man still regularly exposed by the action of the sea

White Park Bay is a spectacular beach 
forming a white arc curving between two headlands on the North Antrim 
Coast. The area is the site of the earliest settlements on the island of
Ireland, with evidence of Neolithic man still regularly exposed by the 
action of the sea.

The ancient dunes and chalky 
grasslands back right up to the beach, making it one of the most 
wildflower-rich coastal sites in all Ireland.

At the eastern end of the sweeping bay
lie the many rocky volcanic islands that surround Ballintoy harbour, 
while the western end leads to the tiny fishing village of Port Braddon.

The village is home to St Gobbans, 
allegedly the smallest church on the island, although the building was 
originally built as a cow shed and used as such until the 1950s.

The cows can now be found on the beach
itself, allowed to graze in order to let the wild flowers flourish 
without intervention from man. The herd has been brought across the sea 
from nearby Rathlin Island, clearly visible from the beach, with the 
distant shores of the Scottish islands of Jura and Islay beyond.
