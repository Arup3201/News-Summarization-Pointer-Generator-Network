The killers of Damilola Taylor should have been hanged, the stabbed schoolboy’s father said yesterday.

Richard Taylor, 63, spoke out hours after Ricky Preddie was released from prison after serving just five years of his sentence.

The 24-year-old was jailed with his younger brother Danny for eight years in 2006 for the manslaughter of ten-year-old Damilola, whose death in 2000 shocked the nation.

The youngster had moved to Britain from Nigeria a few months before he was jabbed in the thigh with a broken beer bottle as he walked home from the local library after school.

He was found bleeding to death in a stairwell near his home in Peckham, south London.

Mr Taylor said: ‘If I had my way the two brothers would have been hung for what they did to Dami.

‘These are boys who premeditatedly attacked and killed a defenceless ten-year-old boy, and to serve just four or five years is ridiculous.’

He said he cannot forgive them because they have shown no remorse, nor apologised, for his son’s death.

Heartache: Damilola's father Richard, with his late wife Gloria, who died in 2008. Mr Taylor today said in an interview he believed his son's killers 'should have been hanged'

Mr Taylor said: ‘If they had used prison to reform themselves instead of just getting bigger in the gym, if they had apologised to me and my family instead of bragging about how tough they are, I would have embraced them.

'I would have hugged my son’s killers.
If they had shown proper remorse, that would have warranted me to 
forgive them, to talk to them about turning their lives round, and it 
would have freed me to move on, too.

This was a big opportunity missed. I
am not blaming the prison system because some people come out reformed,
but these brothers have never apologised.

‘So my bitterness is not only that Dami died, that my wife Gloria died four years ago because of a heart attack brought on by the stress of his death, but also that they have not shown a shred of remorse.’

Ricky Preddie was originally freed in September 2010 but was returned to jail last March after being seen in Southwark, south London, and associating with gang members – both against the terms of his release.

Danny Preddie was released in September last year after serving five years of his sentence.

A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: ‘The decision to release recalled offenders from custody is made by the independent Parole Board.

‘Serious offenders released on licence are subject to a strict set of conditions and controls.

‘If they fail to comply with their licence conditions, they are liable to be returned to custody.’

Last month, Damilola's father criticised the decision to give an OBE to Chris Preddie, a cousin of the killers.

He said he was 'totally against' Mr 
Preddie being honoured for his work with youths, calling for stricter 
rules to be brought in over who should be eligible for honours.

Gary Trowsdale, managing director of 
the Damilola Taylor Trust, said: 'We hope that this time Ricky Preddie 
can keep himself out of trouble and the Probation Service can deliver 
the support he requires to do so.

'There is, of course, absolutely zero evidence that he has been reformed and, like his brother, he has never shown remorse.

'On this basis, as with every other 
victims organisation in the country, we do not understand why he was 
released in the first place.

'What can we do, though? The system is the system, and the system is flawed.'

A
Ministry of Justice spokeswoman said: 'The decision to release recalled
offenders from custody is made by the independent Parole Board - the 
body solely responsible in law for determining whether or not prisoners 
should be released.

'Serious offenders released on licence are subject to a strict set of conditions and controls.

'Examples
include a strict curfew and other restrictions on their movements, as 
well as frequent meetings with their offender manager.

'If they fail to comply with their licence conditions, they are liable to be returned to custody.'

She went on: 'They will also be managed under the statutory Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (Mappa).

'Within
Mappa, the police, probation and prison services are required to work 
together to assess and manage the risks presented by the most dangerous 
offenders, in order to protect the public.'
