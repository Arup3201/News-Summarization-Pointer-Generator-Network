This shocking video shows the moment a pregnant teenager had boiling water thrown over her by her neighbour in a dispute over a garden fence.

Cynthia Almonte Lira, 19, from Formosa, northern Argentina, was arguing with 63-year-old pensioner Celma Prado Bustos after she built a new fence between their homes.

The neighbours can be seen shouting at each other before Ms Bustos, seen standing in her doorway, throws boiling water at the pregnant woman.

Screaming in agony, the woman, who is six-months pregnant, tries to run away but falls over clutching her stomach.

The 19-year-old tears off her soaked shirt as she gets to her feet and dashes to safety, but can still be heard howling in pain.

Seconds later, Ms Lira comes back into shot, the skin on the left side of her bump clearly red and starting to blister. 

She was later taken to hospital by ambulance where she was treated for burns and shock. The mother-to-be has since been released and her baby was believed to be unharmed by the attack.

The footage, which was taken by another neighbour, is being analysed by Argentinian police.

Ms Bustos told officers: 'It is my property, and I felt under threat, so I had to defend myself.

'I live here on my own and I'm elderly, so I have to make sure I let people know I'm not a pushover.'

She also claims she was legally entitled to put up the fence around her home.
