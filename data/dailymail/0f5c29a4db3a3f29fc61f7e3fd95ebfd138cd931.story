Clarke Carlisle pictured outside of court on Monday

Clarke Carlisle has pleaded guilty to a drink-driving offence that occurred two days before the former footballer tried to kill himself by jumping in front of a lorry.

The 35-year-old, still bearing the facial scars from his December 22 suicide attempt in a crash which left him in a coma until mid-January, spoke clearly as he stood in the dock at Highbury Corner Magistrates' Court in north London.

The former Professional Footballers' Association chairman, who played for Leeds United, Burnley and Queens Park Rangers, admitted failing to provide a sample on December 20.

He also pleaded guilty to a charge of driving otherwise than in accordance with a licence on the same date, when police officers spotted a Mercedes travelling in an 'erratic' manner, prosecutor Zahid Hussain said.

Deputy District Judge Margaret Dodds told Carlisle that he would 'inevitably' be disqualified when he next appears at the same court for sentencing on May 14.

She also ordered that reports be made in the case after being told of Carlisle's medical situation.

He had been spotted by police 'swerving' his Mercedes and nearly hitting a lorry on Pentonville Road, north London, on December 20 at about 7am.

Mr Hussain said the car was seen 'swerving in the lane, to the pavement on the nearside, almost mounting the pavement' and that the tyres were 'grinding on the curb'.

When the officers stopped and spoke to Carlisle, 'alcohol was smelled on his breath', Mr Hussain added. 

Carlisle discussed his failed suicide attempt in February with Absolute Radio's Jon Champion in what was his first radio appearance since leaving hospital.

He said he was 'disgusted' with himself and told family members he 'did not want to be here' when they visited him in Leeds General Infirmary. 

'I was only in LGI for three days and throughout those three days my family were coming to see me,' he said. 'Every time I came and felt unconditional love. It was just another point of self loathing. I was disgusted with myself and I said I have to be honest with you 'I still do not want to be here'.

'And that disgusted me even more. Because these are the people who are coming to love me and care for me. And I'm telling them that in spite of that I want to be dead.' 

Carlisle revealed he would have been sectioned if he rejected the chance of attending a psychiatric hospital. 

The lorry driver who struck Carlisle said he may never be able to get behind the wheel again.

Darren Pease feared both he and Carlisle would die after glass shattered following the crash, leaving them with cuts to their faces and the driver temporarily blinded. 

He told the Daily Mirror: 'That feeling is indescribable - to think you are going to die. 

'I don't think I'll ever be able to get behind the wheel of a lorry again. I can't see any way back for me at this point. I can't drive a car properly, never mind a wagon.

'All I could think was that I had killed someone. How am I going to live with this? What am I going to tell everybody?

'What do you say? It's unreal, the shock meant I couldn't stand or walk, I was in a wheelchair.'
