Luke Shaw has admitted he is under pressure to live up to his £31million price tag following his summer move to Manchester United.

The Red Devils forked out big money on the 19-year-old as they looked to replace the experienced Patrice Evra.

Shaw, who made his  debut for United in his new side's 2-1 win against West Ham on Saturday, has been hampered with injury during his first few months at Old Trafford.

The former Southampton defender missed the start of the season with a hamstring injury and was publicly criticised by manager Louis van Gaal during pre-season for failing to meet his high fitness standards.

However, Shaw has now taken Van Gaal's criticism on board and is  ready to establish his place in United's first team.

'There's a lot of pressure on me because I arrived here for a big fee and there's attention that comes with that,' he told the Daily Mirror. 

'Of course, he was right to say that. We had a discussion in pre-season and the plan was to get my fitness up. It worked, I think, apart from the injury. He's been a great inspiration to me.  

'The manager and I talk at the training ground and we have discussions. I feel in good shape.'
