Say cheese! 

This baby great white is in quite the great mood — and he's ready to show off his big smile along California's Golden Coast.

The amazing footage out of Monterey, just south of San Fransciso, shows the growing predator swimming along the harbor as a group of tourists watch.

Videographer Patrick Anders Webster on Monday submerged his camera at Monterey Beach Harbor and captured the incredibly photogenic fish.

The little white shark appears to smile a toothy grin as he swims around the clear-watered harbor.

The shark show happened at Monterey Beach Harbor, where this type of shark doesn't usually swim. Experts say they're showing up that far north along the California coast due to unusually warmer waters

Tourists can be seen gathering in the dock as the shark swims laps around.

'Adults and children were amazed and intrigued after the lifeguards identified it as a harmless shark,' eyewitness Rachael Zalan told KSBW.

'There was a giant crowd following it as it was cruising in the shallows for a good 20 minutes.' 

Wildlife experts at the Monterey Beach Aquarium say these juvenile white sharks can usually be found along the coast of southern California and Mexico.

The warmer fall waters sometimes will draw the unusual guests much farther north.

After capturing the stunning footage, Webster could only say: 'WOW. I mean... Wait, what??!'
