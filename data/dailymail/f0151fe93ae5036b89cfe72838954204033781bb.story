If you want to  live like a pop star, the perfect opportunity awaits. This stunning five-bedroom house, which was home to rocker Robbie Williams until recently, is now back on the rental market. The catch? You'll have to part with an eye-watering £10,000 a week.

The interior-designed property is bang in the middle of Celebrity Central - London's St John's Wood. So for your money you'll also acquire a selection of celebrity neighbours.

Keith Richards, Sir Paul McCartney, Lily Allen and Ewan McGregor all live within spitting distance of the property.

The Little Venice rental that the couple have now vacated overlooks Regent's Canal in Little Venice and has a super-sleek interior

But now that 40-year-old Robbie and wife Ayda Field have had baby number two, a five-bedroom mansion is just too tight. So the couple have moved into a 46-room mansion in Holland Park, which they bought from Michael Winner for £17.5 million last year.

'Little Venice is fairly unique with its pretty tree-lined canal and houseboats,' Alexandra Fleck, head of St John’s Wood lettings at Savills, where the property is marketed. 'There are beautiful regency style terraces and it's a small, discreet and quiet area - but still great for people wanting to be close to central London

'Several other celebrities live in the neighbourhood, from various McCartney’s, one of the Gallagher brothers, Paul Weller and several members of the Rothschilds banking family.'

Unique design touches include a glass ceiling and floor-to-ceiling glass wall in the dining room 

The kitchen has a quirky touch with a pale pink glass backsplash 

'It's low key but upscale,' she adds. 

The Little Venice rental that the couple have now vacated is overlooking Regent's Canal in Little Venice and has a super-sleek interior. 

It also has a few unique design touches, like the pale pink back-splash in the kitchen and the glass ceiling in the dining room.

The open-plan kitchen, dining and living room also has a floor-to-ceiling glass wall overlooking the garden.

Sleep like a rock star:  The main bedroom in the home Robbie and Ayda shared

The ensuite bathroom to the main bedroom is sleek and modern

There's also a formal reception room with views over the garden, a study area and a gym.

The main bedroom has an en suite bathroom and plenty of storage and there are four further bedrooms, two with ensuites, and a further two bathrooms. 

Other benefits included in the £43,000 monthly rental are gated off-street parking and direct access to communal gardens with a tennis courts and play area.

So what sort of people might be looking to rent this? 'It's perfect for a smaller family who want great entertaining space,' says Alexandra.  

The property has a second lounge area, styled in neutral tones

The 150ft garden is unusually large for the area and the property also has access to a communal area with tennis courts
