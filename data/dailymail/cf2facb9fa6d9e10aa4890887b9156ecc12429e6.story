Life-saving operation: Toby Dring, from north Yorkshire, had open heart surgery at 22 hours old, with mother Sophie

Parents of children with serious heart conditions were ‘obstructed’  from seeking treatment elsewhere by staff at a scandal-hit heart unit, campaigners have claimed.

Heart operations on children at Leeds General Infirmary were suspended on Thursday night following concerns over high death rates and allegedly unsafe practices.

A senior heart surgeon at the unit has also been banned from operating on children while ‘aspects of his practice’ are investigated.

NHS bosses said they had been forced 
to act after finding that death rates were twice the national average – 
with ‘clear blue water’ between the number of patients dying at the unit
and mortality rates elsewhere.

The
suspension of the unit provoked a huge political row yesterday, with 
MPs and some parents claiming the timing – just 24 hours after a High 
Court ruling quashed plans to close the centre – was ‘deeply 
questionable’.

Some experts said the data on death rates was ‘preliminary’ and should not have been used to justify the suspension.

But yesterday shocking new claims emerged that families unhappy with the care at the unit had been blocked from going elsewhere.

Staff at the unit – which has been operating under threat of closure since last year – were said to have been so desperate for patients not to go to another hospital that they gave ‘wholly inappropriate’ advice to patients.

One such family was even reported to social services, it is alleged.

The NHS safety watchdog the Care Quality Commission was sent a letter by the patient group HeartLine last month, claiming that:

Heartbreaking: Sophie Dring insisted to be referred to the Freeman Hospital in Newcastle after doctors at Leeds General Infirmary told her there was no chance Toby would survive

Sophie
Dring claims a cardiologist at Leeds General Infirmary tried to 
pressure her into having an abortion when her unborn child was diagnosed
with a serious heart condition.

The 26-year-old said her son Toby, 
now 18 months, only survived because she researched his condition and 
discovered he could have life-saving surgery.

Miss Dring was five months pregnant
when she was told her baby had hypoplastic left heart syndrome, which 
occurs when the left side of the heart fails to form properly.

She claims a consultant cardiologist then told her there was no chance of him surviving and that she should have a termination.

However, after finding there was an
operation possible – at the Freeman Hospital in Newcastle – she 
insisted she be referred there.

Toby was induced at 39 weeks on 
September 8 2011 and transferred immediately to the Freeman Hospital, 
where he underwent major surgery when he was just 22 hours old.

Miss Dring, of Whitby, North 
Yorkshire, welcomed news of a review into care service at Leeds General 
Infirmary. She said: ‘Toby still has a long way to go and will need a 
heart transplant in the future but he is doing well.

‘He lives life to the full. It is heartbreaking to look at him and think he wouldn’t be here if Leeds had their way.’

The letter compared the situation to 
the Bristol heart scandal in the 1990s, where 35 babies died and dozens 
more were left brain-damaged by hospital failures. 

It
accuses the unit of trying to protect its reputation as a safe surgical
centre by sending complex surgeries to other centres or not risking 
operations that may be unsuccessful.

The LGI strongly denied ‘any suggestion we would act improperly’.

But Anne Keatley Clarke, chief executive of the Children’s Heart Federation, which represents 22 bodies including HeartLine, said she had written to the CQC because she felt ‘morally obliged to flag up safety concerns’.

She said: ‘It appears managers and clinicians in Leeds, together with the parent support group, have put their own interests ahead of the well-being of critically ill children.’

Critically ill: Toby Dring is the youngest person in the country to undergo open heart surgery. He had the operation in Newcastle after doctors at Leeds General Infirmary allegedly pressured mother Sophie to have an abortion

She claimed many families had been left too frightened to raise concerns in case it affected the care given to their children.

Mrs Keatley Clarke said the ‘chilling’ parents’ cases came after numerous other worries had been raised about LGI, and called for the unit to be permanently closed.

Leeds is one of three out of 14 children’s heart units set to close following last year’s Safe and Sustainable NHS Review aimed at providing services in a smaller number of specialised centres.

Controversial decision: Sir Bruce Keogh as National Medical Director authorised the suspension of the unit

The unit fought back, with huge public support and a legal campaign against the closure. It won the first round of a court battle on Wednesday after judges found the consultation on closing the unit had been flawed.

The move to close the unit over safety concerns just 24 hours later  led campaigners and MPs to question the basis of the court decision.

Greg Mulholland, MP for Leeds North West, said he was ‘stunned and appalled’ by the suspension and called for NHS medical director Sir Bruce Keogh to resign.

He also called on Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt to immediately lift the suspension of the Leeds unit.

‘Sir Bruce Keogh should resign as he has both authorised this wholly unreasonable and deeply questionable action and also presided over the fundamentally flawed Safe and Sustainable review,’ he said.

The row intensified further when an expert claimed the mortality data on which the decision was based was ‘not fit to be used’.

Dr John Gibbs, of the steering committee for the Central Cardiology Audit database, which supplied the data, said the figures were preliminary and had not undergone the ‘usual rigorous checking process’.

But Sir Bruce yesterday said it would have been irresponsible to ignore a ‘constellation’ of warnings,  including mortality data. He told BBC Radio 4’s Today: ‘I couldn’t sit back just because the timing was inconvenient, awkward or would look suspicious, as it does.’

The suspension was agreed by the Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, whose chief executive Maggie Boyle apologised to parents and families who will be affected.

NHS England said the suspension was for checks to be made to ensure the unit is operating safely.The CQC last night admitted it had received claims that uncertainty over the future of children’s heart surgery at the LGI was harming outcomes.

A CQC spokesman said: ‘We are in close contact with the trust to ensure effective arrangements are in place to protect the safety and welfare of patients during the period of the review.’
