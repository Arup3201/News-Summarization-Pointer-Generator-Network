This stunning floral display bursting with colour and delicate blooms looks like a prize-winning creation from the Chelsea Flower Show -- but glance at the roots and you’ll notice there’s something missing.

Rather than growing out of a plant pot, this floral arrangement is emerging from the pages of a book and is in fact a work of the most intricate origami.

This incredible sculpture and others by artist Su Blackwell are made entirely from the pages of second-hand books and inspired from the illustrations within.

Sertum Orchidaceum, which took three months to create, was inspired by a 1840s book of the same name

The London-based artist trawls second-hand bookshops, car-boot sales and markets for titles that inspire her.

This piece, named Sertum Orchidaceum after the book its been intricately fashioned from, is part of the artist's latest series called Wild Flowers Of Britain, which she embarked on after stumbling across antique books on flora in a vintage bookshop in Charing Cross.

‘The book’s covers were dusty and they looked like they hadn't been opened for years, yet they were full of beautiful illustrations,’ the artist tells MailOnline. ‘I wanted the flower illustrations to be the first thing you saw, before having to open the book to see them.'

In detail: Su Blackwell's jaw-dropping sculptures are a work of the most intricate origami

‘Books are very intimate, and they have a relationship with their reader. I was interested in removing the illustrations and text from the book and offering them out to a wider audience,' she says.

This work of efflorescent art, along with another two book sculptures by the artist, are currently on show at London’s Long And Ryle gallery in Beyond The Book, an exhibition showcasing artists who use books as their medium.

Su started developing this technique in 2003 following a visit to South East Asia in 2001. ‘I encountered paper-art used in spiritual ceremonies, and came across techniques like origami and paper-cutting,' she says.

‘When I returned to UK, I began exploring working with paper, which led me to work with books. The first book-sculpture I made was using a second hand book I bought in Thailand,' she recalls.

The artist, who originally studied embroidery at the Royal College of Art in London, has always had a penchant for quirky medium. ‘I’ve always been interested in deconstructing non-art objects and then transforming them into works of art, while making them defunct of their original use.

Ten years later, Su has created more than 100 different book sculptures, which cost from £5,000.

‘When I began making them they were very two-dimensional. I have been developing my techniques, and they have become more sculptural, and some include lights and motors to add movement,' she says.

‘It is a tediously slow process, working on a miniature-scale, each sculpture takes around one month to complete.’

Sertum Orchidaceum, which is created from illustrations cut from a copy from 1840 and was commissioned by Sotheby's for an exhibition at Chatsworth House, is one of the largest of Su’s pieces to date and took approximately three months to complete.

Another of her most challenging  projects was the mosque she created for the Fairmont Hotel Group in Abu Dhabi, which took two months of work. 

So what’s the process of turning a piece of literature into a work of art? ‘Firstly I source the book and read it, often more than once. I sometimes draw a sketch of the overall sculpture, and then I draw templates to cut out.

'I cut through the pages of the book one at a time with a scalpel, and use glue to help strengthen the paper.'

Careful not to give away the secrets behind her feats of artistic engineering, Su adds, ‘I use a very fine wire to suspend paper-cut elements, such as snowflakes and stars.'

So which one’s her favourite? ‘I get emotionally involved with every single piece, so it’s hard to pick. But I think some of the most successful of my works are from the stories that I have had most enjoyed reading, and have lost myself in, like The Baron In The Trees, The Shell Seekers, and Alice: A Mad Tea Party.’
