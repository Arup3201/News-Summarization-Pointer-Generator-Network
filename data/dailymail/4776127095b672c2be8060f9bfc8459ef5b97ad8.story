A nationally ranked boxer who hoped to make the 2016 Olympic team has been crushed to death by a six-ton tank he was sandblasting on a job.

Tony Losey, a 22-year-old engaged dad of two, was working as a subcontractor at a steel plate company in Wichita, Kansas on Tuesday afternoon when the tank slipped and fell on him.

Police Sergeant John Ryan told the Wichita Eagle that although the tanks fall several times a year - often because their weight is not properly supported - people are usually able to get out of the way.

'It doesn't take much once you get that kind of weight moving,' Ryan said. 'Everything shifts out of the way, and it starts sliding.'

Big dreams: Losey had hoped to qualify and try out for the 2016 Olympic boxing team next year

When Losey was found pinned beneath the tank, he was not breathing. Emergency crews arrived on the scene within minutes but he was later pronounced dead.

The young dad was well known in boxing circles and was ranked third nationally in the 152-pound weightclass by USA Boxing in July. 

His coach at Wichita’s Northside Boxing Club, Lewis Hernandez, told KWCH that he was devastated by the loss of Losey, whom he considered to be like a son.

'He's an excellent young man, I mean a great young man. Real... real humble,' said Hernandez, adding that Losey was never too busy to help someone out. 

Left behind: Losey, who was ranked third in the country for his weight class, was an engaged dad of two

'He'd go help another kid, you know? See a beginner doing something wrong, he'd go over there and correct them and he'd stick with them, whether it took away from his training time or not.'

Speaking to the Eagle, Hernandez added that it was his goal to reach the Olympics.

It was his plan to compete at a qualifying trial in January in Washington before hopefully heading to the Olympic Trials in a bid to score a sport on Team USA for 2016.

Losey, who was planning his wedding, had turned to boxing to escape the darker areas of his life, Hernandez told the Eagle.

His brother was sentenced earlier this month to life in prison for a hit-and-run death of a 34-year-old woman in October last year.

Scene: He was sandblasting a tank at Boardman in Wichita, Texas on Tuesday when the accident unfolded

Losey had been in the car at the time of the accident and cops found out he'd violated his probation from a 2011 aggravated battery case by being out past 9pm and by drinking alcohol.

As a result, his probation was extended by a year.

One of the conditions was that he could only leave home to attend work - but the judge recently allowed him to go to the gym too, after hearing impressive reports of Losey's hard work on the job. 

'This is a sad day,' Hernandez added. 'We just have to remember the good times we had with Tony.'
