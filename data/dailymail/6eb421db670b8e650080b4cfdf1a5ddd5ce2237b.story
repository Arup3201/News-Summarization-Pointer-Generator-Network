Singer Susan Boyle's PR team were left red-faced after tweeting a promotion for her new album with a 'hashtag' featuring a rude double entendre.

To promote the star's new album Standing Ovation, an out-of-hour social media team used her her official Twitter account @SusanBoyleHQ sent a tweet ending in a 'hashtag', where key words are joined together and preceded by a hash sign.

The hashtag read #susanalbumparty.

Clever or just rather naive? The tweet, which could be read one of two ways, was soon trending worldwide

Twitter users quickly realised that while it was supposed to read 'Susan album party', it could also have another meaning.

Soon it was 'trending' as it became one of the most retweeted, or repeated, Twitter hashtags in the world.

Capital FM presenter Lisa Snowdon said: 'I don't think Susan Boyle's record company thought this hashtag through properly.'

Twitter user Paul de Bruin said: 'Is this PR genius or huge fail? #fail'.

It is believed the double entendre was unintentional, and the singer's PR team declined to comment but deleted the tweet.

The
 Standing Ovation album was released this week and the 'party' mentioned
 in the hashtag is a question and answer session to launch the 
collection of stage songs.

Today the Scottish singer, who is worth £22m, spoke of her wish to find a soulmate to share her life with.  But she said she would not turn her hand to internet dating.

'Of course I'd like that special someone in my life, but I'm not going to let a man define me.

'I've done pretty well over the past 51 years without one but it would be nice.'

She told the Daily Mirror: 'I believe in letting things happen naturally and not shopping for a man on the internet.

'If my soulmate is out there then I will find him but it won't be on a computer.'
