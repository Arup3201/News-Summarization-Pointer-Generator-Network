An Oregon mother says she got sick after eating at Olive Garden and the illness forced her to undergo a Caesarian section instead of a natural birth.

Now, 34-year-old Miranda Fischer of Tigard is suing the company for $50,000 in damages.

According to the lawsuit filed in Multnomah County Circuit Court, Ms Fischer and her husband Erandi Saucedo ate lunch with 11 other relatives at the location in Salem, Oregon on January 21.

Within 36 hours, 13 people who ate at the restaurant, including Ms Fischer and her husband, became sick with gastrointestinal symptoms.

When Ms Fischer went into labor soon after, she started suffering nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and dehydration in the hospital.

Doctors discovered that her baby was in the breech position, but Ms Fischer was too sick and dehydrated for them to turn the baby for a normal head-first delivery so they were forced to perform a Caesarian section instead.

'They couldn't do it,' her lawyer Thomas Patton told the Oregonian. 'They just knocked her out and went ahead with an emergency Cesarian

Contagion: Norovirus is a very contagious illness which causes the stomach and intestines to become inflamed. Above, what the virus looks like under a microscope

Also known as the Winter Vomiting Bug in the UK, norovirus is a very contagious illness that causes the stomach and intestines to become inflamed.

Symptoms of norovirus include diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, stomach pain, fever, headache and body aches.

Norovirus can also cause dehydration which can result in a decrease in urination, dry mouth and throat and feeling dizzy when standing up.

Norovirus is sometimes described as food poisoning or the stomach flu, which is incorrect. While food poisoning can be a result of norovius, other germs and chemicals can cause food poisoning as well.

Noroviris is spread by accidentally ingesting the stool of an infected person. This usually happens by eating food contaminated with the virus, touching something contaminated with the virus or having contact with someone already infected.

Past outbreaks of norovirus have been linked to leafy greens, fresh fruit and shellfish but any food served raw or exposed to the virus after being cooked can become contaminated.

At the same time Ms Fischer was delivering her baby, her husband was also experiencing the food poisoning-like symptoms and couldn't support his wife through labor the way he would if he were healthy.

Blood tests later confirmed that Ms Fischer was infected with the norovirus. Its unclear whether the same tests were performed on her husband, but she was the only person diagnosed with the virus.

While both parents and the baby are fine, the family is suing the company for negligence, saying the restaurant failed to maintain health standards which lead to Ms Fischer getting sick and having a C-section.

In the lawsuit they say the Olive Garden failed to make sure employees washed their hands, or that the food was properly cleaned, prepared and cooked.Â 

They also say that the restaurant allowed a staff member to work while infected with the virus.

The claim is currently pending with Liberty Mutual, the restaurant's insurance company.

But a spokesman for Darden, Olive Garden's parent company, says they are not to blame.

'We don't have any indication that this lady contracted norovirus at our restaurant or that norovirus caused her to have a C-section,' spokesman Rich Jeffers said. 'We don't have any indication of a norovirus outbreak in January 2013.'

There was an outbreak of gastrointestinal illness on a Royal Carribean cruise ship this month that caused more than 300 of the 4,000 on board to get sick and norovirus is the suspected culprit. That ship, The Explorer of the Seas, is due back in port in New Jersey today, two days earlier than its scheduled 10-day cruise.
