Chelsea duo Didier Drogba and Kurt Zouma are getting on so well they have started rapping together in their spare time.

The French-speaking duo combined to become ‘The DrogFather ft Zoumanaaan’ as they returned from what looking like a Chelsea away game and uploaded it to the Ivorian striker's Instagram.

Zouma has been dubbed the new Marcel Desailly by Jose Mourinho following his impressive start to life in the Premier League.

It all looks to be going swimmingly for the 20-year-old on the pitch, but if it does for some reason all go wrong then at least Zouma will have a rap career to fall back on.

Lyrics partner Drogba is currently enjoying his second spell with the west London outfit having had a spell in Turkey.

Drogba returned in the summer and as his rapping shows, the Ivorian hasn't missed a beat…
