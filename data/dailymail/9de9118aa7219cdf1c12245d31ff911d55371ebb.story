Devoted: John Bayley and Iris Murdoch. The couple met while he was a young academic at Oxford

The film Iris, about the novelist Iris Murdoch’s descent into Alzheimer’s disease, was directed by Richard Eyre — whose own mother suffered from this appalling form of dementia. It was, obviously, an extremely harrowing story, which touched the hearts of many.

Audiences watched the young Iris (played by Kate Winslet), a tousled tomboy cycling round Oxford, her head full of philosophy and the fiction which would make her name.

Then we saw Dame Judi Dench (as the older Iris) in a cardie, becoming at first muddled, and then more or less witless. Iris’s husband, John Bayley, in old age, was played by Jim Broadbent, an avuncular, gentle figure, whose devotion to his wife was saint-like.

I watched the film, which appeared in 2001, with a mixture of emotions. I had known John, who died this week aged 89, and Iris well for many years.

John had been my tutor at university, and Iris was a good friend, who encouraged me in my early writing career. We had seen a great deal of one another in over 30 years of friendship.

Like all their friends, I had admired the gallant way in which John coped with his wife’s illness. He scarcely left her side during the four years the nightmare went on. No doubt about it, John was a hero in the way he had nursed her.

But even before she died, he published a memoir — the book on which the film was based, and what would be the first of a trilogy about Iris.

It was moving, telling how, as a shy young academic at St Antony’s College, Oxford, he had one day looked out of the window and seen this young woman (rather older than himself) cycling past. He had decided she was the girl for him — not because he fancied her, but because he didn’t!

Scared of sex, he was not particularly interested in the act (still less in the idea of offspring). The passages about sex in the book were both unconvincing and more than a little bit troubling.

But if we all knew that Iris was bisexual and that she had several lovers, none of us guessed, until a biography published after her death, how unfaithful she had been. There were dozens of lovers, throughout her marriage. Men and women alike.

I had always had a half-sense that this pair, so close in many ways, and so obviously in a ‘good marriage’, were not quite as other couples.

I suppose I had known them about 20 years when Iris suggested she and I went to lunch, just the two of us. Another friend of theirs, who had known John since they were students together, said: ‘But you normally have lunch with John.’

‘Yes,’ I replied, ‘but Iris has suggested we meet up in London.’

‘Well, I’m telling you,’ said the friend, ‘if you say yes, you’ll never have another lunch with John.’

I thought the friend was being absurd. At the time, I had lunch with John, on average, every couple of weeks, and had done so for 20 years. I did not refuse Iris’s invitation.

But sure enough, my friend was right. Though I sometimes had dinner with them together, that lunch with Iris was enough to bring my special friendship with John to an end.

I realised then how very jealous he was, and after she died, I saw how much he must have resented her repeated unfaithfulness.

When I reread his accounts of their life together, and of her illness, I came to think that, despite his love and willingness to care for her, other things had been going on as well.

One was a possessive desire to have Iris all to himself. Another was a little like vengeance.

His accounts of her ‘in her water-buffalo guise’ — a reference to her lumbering movements — are not very loving. The descriptions of her loss of bodily control, of her dirtiness, of his need to hose her down when she was doubly incontinent, are profoundly shameful.

These descriptions, and the subsequent film, had the effect of almost expunging Iris Murdoch’s fame as a writer.

She was no longer the woman who, for three decades and more, had written witty novels about the emotional chaos in which we live. She was the Alzheimer’s lady played by Dame Judi.

Had John intended this?

As well as being an Oxford don and literary critic, he was an unsuccessful novelist.

Was he, consciously or not, envious of his wife’s success, and boiling with resentment at all the girlfriends and boyfriends with whom she had made a fool of him?

That was how it must have seemed to many readers of his very strange memoirs. I published my own account of the Iris I knew, and did not hide my unhappiness at John’s unflinching portrait of her.

But the years have passed, and now that he is dead, I find my mind going back to the time when I first knew John Bayley.

He was one of the most amusing, original beings I ever met. He was very widely read, but he bore his learning lightly, and he was in no sense a scholar.

He loved C.S. Forester’s Hornblower stories and childish books about World War II aeroplanes as much as he loved the highbrow stuff, even though, at his best, he was one of the finest critics of difficult modern poetry I ever read.

His books were rather waffly. They belong to a vanished era of literary criticism and I can not imagine anyone getting anything out of them today.

However, his conversation could be sublime, whether expounding his reason for loving the novels of Tolstoy, the poetry of Browning, or the plays of Shakespeare. At the same time, there was a strong element of blarney. He was well-known for having ‘learnt Russian’, but I remember his face, at a party, when a friend of mine quoted perhaps the most famous lines of the Russian poet Pushkin to John.

The passages about sex in the book were both unconvincing and more than a little bit troubling

It was quite clear he hadn’t the foggiest what was being said. Yet he went on to be the judge of the Russian Booker prize!

John also chaired the English Booker Prize committee, yet, after stammering out the winner’s name, he told me he had not actually read the winning entry.

Charles Arrowby, the narrator in Iris’s novel The Sea, The Sea, dreams up some highly distinctive dishes to eat alone, such as braised onions dusted with curry powder and served with a little tomato ketchup (‘Only a fool despises tomato ketchup’). These odd recipes were all supplied by John.

In the days of Iris’s health and vigour, dinner with them would include some very weird concoctions — slices of pork pie as a starter, Battenberg cake for pudding, and chicken scattered with dandelions and curry powder as a main course.

Once we went to supper with them in Iris’s London flat and four people shared one scrambled egg. Corned beef in their fridge would quite often be growing a grey mould.

But those meals were joyous, with lots of cheap wine and whisky. Even with appalling hangovers the next day, it did not stop one remembering the hilarious, frivolous talk.

They were both tremendous gossips, but — unlike me, I fear — they were not malicious, and I think John was right when he used to say that Iris never found anyone boring.

In their heyday they were universally adored. I never met anyone who disliked them. They seemed like babes in the wood, and their curious partnership — whether or not it had ever possessed a sexual element, and perhaps because it did not — seemed harmonious and fun.

Bald, bespectacled, shambolic, clad in ill-fitting clothes from charity shops, and seldom without a cloth cap, John was eccentric almost to the point of lunacy.

At a tea-party at my college, I once saw him stuffing sandwiches and delicate, creamy meringues into his pockets. Suppers at home often consisted of the fried-up contents of his pockets.

He was not really able to cope with ‘normal’ life. John had a stammer, a very posh voice and had been educated at Eton.

Harmonious: In their heyday, Iris and John were universally adored and their partnership seemed harmonious

John was terrified of ‘ordinary people’. Once, he found himself opposite one of these frightening beings on the train. Even worse, the man tried to make conversation.

‘Now don’t tell me,’ said the man. ‘I’d guess you are a lawyer.’

‘S-s-s-sort of,’ was John’s nervous reply.

‘Where are you going to?’

Edinburgh was the real answer, but either because he could not say the word, or because lying came naturally to him, John answered, ‘B-B-Birmingham.’

When they reached Birmingham, the man stared at him so hard that John felt obliged to get out. Iris, who was waiting anxiously for him on the platform at Edinburgh Waverley, had no idea where he had disappeared to.

After Iris died in 1999, John married their friend Audi Villers. He once said they talked ‘incessantly about Iris; never stop, really’.

I sorely regret, in many ways, having gone public with my feelings of dismay about the memoirs John had written.

It still strikes me as weird, even incomprehensible, that he could have written in that humiliating way about Iris, and that — conscious or unconscious of his feelings of envy and resentment — he reduced her by writing the books.

He was furious with me for writing as I did and our friendship was, of course, utterly destroyed.

This does not prevent me from seeing that, with his passing, we have lost one of the greatest, most glorious English eccentrics.
