Doctors say the 12-year-old girl who contracted a deadly amoeba while swimming at an Arkansas water park will be the third to survive the brain-eating parasite.

Kali Hardig contracted parasitic meningitis, a very rare form of meningitis that only 130 people have been diagnosed with in the U.S. in the past fifty years, a month ago. It's 99 per cent fatal with only two reported instances of survival.

But doctors now believe Kali will make it out of the woods, due in large part to early detection and experimental treatment.

Getting better: Doctors believe 12-year-old Kali Hardig will survive her rare form of meningitis she got from an amoeba at an Arkansas water park

Good signs: Kali wrote her name for the first time Monday, left, after only barely being able to squeeze her mother's hand a week ago

Kali was brought into the Arkansas Children's Hospital on July 19 with a fever, not long after she went swimming at the Willow Springs Water Park in Little Rock.

Doctors diagnosed her with primary amebic meningoencephalitis (PAM), a rare form of meningitis which has only produced 130 cases in the U.S in the past 50 years.

The rare form of meningitis is caused by the Naegleria fowleri amoeba entering the body through the nose and traveling into the brain.

Symptoms appear quickly, about one to seven days after inception, and include headache, fever, nausea, vomiting and get worse causing stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance, seizures and hallucinations.

Eventually the infection destroys brain tissue which causes fatal brain swelling.

To combat the the infection, doctors cooled Kali's body to reduce the swelling and even put her on breast-cancer drugs.

'She wound up being on a ventilator for over two weeks,' said Dr. Mark Heulitt, one of the doctors who treated her. But the treatment seems to have worked, and she was taken off the ventilator on August 6. Three days later, Kali was moved out of the pediatric intensive care unit.

Stronger: Kali was taken off a ventilator and transferred out of the pediatric intensive care unit last week

On Monday her family posted a picture on a Facebook support page of Kali writing her name for the first time. That's remarkable progress for a girl who was barely able to squeeze her mother's hand last week.

They are obviously ecstatic at the change of outlook.

'We've went from being told that our little girl wouldn't survive this amoeba to now they're saying that Kali is going to be the third survivor and going to get to go home,' said her mother Traci Hardig.

Primary amoebic meningoencephalitis is as rare as it is horrific.

It is caused by an amoeba that implants itself in its victim's brains - usually when infected water shoots of their noses.

The amoeba needs very specific conditions to thrive. It grows in the sediment at the bottom of pools of warm, stagnant water and is most active at about 85 degrees.

The water must reach a relatively high temperature for the parasites to reach numbers that threaten humans.

Health officials have recorded only 125 instances of the disease in the United States in the last 50 years.

Only one person has survived in the United States. One other survivor was found in Mexico

Health officials say swimmers can reduce their risks even further by:

Ms Hardig, who is battling breast 
cancer, is now making sure to focus on her health so she can take care 
of Kali when she gets home.

'It's kind of a battle to decide that 
you want to put your health on hold because you want to totally focus on
Kali, but I know I have to try to get myself better too, because Kali's 
coming home and I'm going to get to take care of her,' she said.

Ms Hardig is also hoping to raise awareness of another case of PAM. Zachary Reyna is being treated for the infection at Miami Children's Hospital. He contracted the amoeba while knee boarding in a ditch near his house with friends in LaBelle, Florida earlier this month.

'We're praying for him to be survivor number four,' Ms Hardig said.

The condition is caused when the Naegleria parasite enters a patient's brain, usually after accidentally inhaling stagnant, warm water up the nose while swimming.

Arkansas Department of Health spokesman Ed Barham told MailOnline the water must be forcefully, almost violently, pushed up the nose - as it can be after diving into the water, being dunked or using a water slide.

Naegleria are found in nearly every freshwater body of water - even lakes. But, they only become active when water heats up.

The
cruel irony of the parasite is that the risk is highest when the 
temperature is hottest - and swimmers are looking for a reprieve from 
the heat.

The CDC says there
have been around 130 cases of the disease in the U.S. in the last five decades
- making the disease extremely rare, when compared to the number of 
lakes and muddy swimming holes Americans dip into for refuge from the 
summer heat each year.

Another case: 12-year-old Zachary Reyna of LaBelle, Florida is also fighting the infection after contracting the amoeba knee boarding in a ditch earlier this month

The U.S. has recorded just 130 cases of Naegleria fowleri infections in the last 50 years

The amoebas are most active when the water temperature reaches about 85 degrees, Barham said.

However, this is the second time the parasite has infected a swimmer at Willow Springs Water Park.

In August 2010, 7-year-old Davian Briggs died after contracting the disease after he had been swimming at the lake.

Because two cases have been seen from the same body was water, state health officials asked the park owners to close their swimming hole. They obliged.

'Though the odds of contracting Naegleria are extremely low, they are just not good enough to allow our friends or family to swim,' owners David and Lou Ann Ratliff said in a statement.

Closed: The owners of Willow Springs Water Park near Little Rock, Arkansas, have shut down the lake after learning of two reported cases of the deadly disease in three years

Another tragedy: Davian Briggs, 7, died of the disease in 2010 after swimming at the Willow Springs Water Park - where little Kali is believed to have been infected

The park, which attracts up to 250 swimmers a day - and thousands over the course of a summer - is now looking into installing a hard pool bottom at the swimming hole and filling it with chlorinated water supplied by Little Rock.

Kali's mother said she had no idea about the risks of swimming in warm lakes and had never heard of the disease.

'You're a mom, you're a dad. You can still take your child swimming. We don't want to scare people. We just want you to know there are little things you can do to help them out. So they can go and still be a kid,' she said.

She encourages parents to make their children wear nose plugs while swimming - to minimize the risk of inhaling water through the nose and contracting the Naegleria parasite.

Still, Barham, of the health department, says that swimmers really shouldn't be too concerned about the danger of swimming in fresh water.
