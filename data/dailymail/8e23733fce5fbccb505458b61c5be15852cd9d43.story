A man had to be rescued by coastguards after he followed his beloved dog down a steep cliff face in a bid to save him. 

The Staffordshire bull terrier was being walked off a lead and had been distracted chasing birds when it plunged 60ft down a cliff on Porth Island in Newquay in Cornwall. 

His owner scrambled down the cliff face in a desperate attempt to rescue the family pet but then discovered it was dead and became stuck himself, unable to get back to the top and stranded on a ridge surrounded by swelling waters.

A man had to be rescued by the RNLI after he followed his dog down a steep cliff face in Newquay in a bid to save the animal after it fell 

He then called the coastguard for help and a lifeboat crew were called out to save the man.

The dog, which is understood to be a family pet, had died from falling down the cliffs, which are around 20ft high in some places. Rescuers managed to get to the man as he stood on a ledge at the base of the cliff face, with water swelling around him.

A spokeswoman for the RNLI said he would have been trapped there overnight by the incoming tides had he not been rescued at about 4pm on Tuesday. 

She said: 'The Staffie had been chasing birds on the cliff top and had sadly forgotten that birds have wings.

'Its owner had seen the unplanned leap and scrambled down the cliffs after his dog.

'Unfortunately he was unable to do anything further for his pet. Dogs should be on leads when they are being walked on cliff tops. People do need to think first before they follow their pets down cliff faces. We know it's human nature, but it can be very dangerous.' 

The coastguard and an RNLI crew were dispatched to rescue the man, who had become trapped on a ledge on Porth Island in Newquay 

The rescue follows another by the team last week at nearby Whipsiderry beach when three walkers became trapped by incoming tides 

The man was unhurt after the ordeal but told rescuers he would now have to tell his wife and children that their family dog had died. 

Newquay RNLI said recent mild weather and spring tides had made for a busy week for crews, who have been called out five times since getting a new boat on November 5. 

They said this was particularly busy as they had been called 46 times throughout the whole year. 

The man and his dog were piled into the boat and taken to the shore in Newquay by rescuers after they were called on Tuesday afternoon

Rescuers and walkers gathered to watch the dramatic rescue of the man and his dog, but sadly the animal was pronounced dead 

The spokeswoman added: 'This time of year we are normally quiet. We've had good weather which sees people come out to cliffs and beaches and we've also got spring tides. People do get caught in these.' 

A spokeman from the Maritime and Coastguard Agency said: 'At 3.30pm on 25 November, the Newquay Coastguard Rescue Team and the Newquay Inshore Lifeboat were sent to Porth Island, Newquay after reports that a member of the public had become trapped at the bottom of a gully after trying to recover his dog. The lifeboat landed a crewman and extracted the man by sea where he was taken back to Newquay. Sadly the gentleman's dog had died. The man was reunited with his coat and belongings, recovered by the Newquay team, which were down the gully.'

Last week rescuers were dispatched to rescue three walkers who had become trapped by the incoming tides at Whipsiderry beach, near Newquay.

It is thought the walkers had become trapped on a rock after losing track of time and failed to notice the waters swelling around them. Attempts to rescue the trio using a harness had to be abandoned after the cliff face started to crumble, and the RNLI managed to rescue them from the water just minutes before the rock they had been standing on was completely submerged. 

Jennifer Grant also had to be rescued by crews in Porth Island two days ago after she fell into the sea while surfing after she had got married. She had managed to scramble onto rocks at Porth Island but was unable to get to the shore by herself.
