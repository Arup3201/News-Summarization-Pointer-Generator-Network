A teenage burglar who stole cash from a children's home was caught after he dropped his birth certificate at the scene during the raid. 

Nathan Carver accidentally left the incriminating 
piece of evidence after breaking into Jasmin House in the Alwoodley area of 
Leeds, West Yorkshire, a court heard.

The 19-year-old forced open a box containing keys to the safe when he raided the children’s home on August 14 
last year.

Carver, 19, raided the children's home, pictured, after youngsters had been taken on a trip to the cinema by staff on the evening of August 14 last year

He targeted the property after youngsters had 
been taken out on an evening trip to the cinema by staff.

Leeds Crown Court heard how Carver stole £179 and three mobile phones from the safe and caused £370 worth of damage.

Carver, of Harehills, Leeds, was arrested after his birth certificate was found on the office floor. His fingerprints were found on a window ledge.

Despite being released on bail for the offence, the teenager continued to offend and was part of a gang which attacked two men during separate incidents.

Duncan Ritchie, for the prosecution, said both victims were targeted as they crossed a bridge near the Royal Armouries in Leeds.

One victim was left with a serious injury to his arm and had to undergo surgery to have metal pins fitted in his wrist.

Carver pleaded guilty to burglary, causing grievous bodily harm and assault occasioning actual bodily harm. The court heard about Carver's long history of offending and he was classed as a ‘third strike’ burglar.

James Lake, for the defence, said his client had pleaded guilty to the offences at an early opportunity and had co-operated with police. He said the teenager had gone through a troubled upbringing.

Recorder Andrew Haslam ordered Carver to be sent to a young offenders’ institution for three years and two months.

Recorder Haslam said: 'You are 19 years old and you have, for someone of your age, a very bad record.'
