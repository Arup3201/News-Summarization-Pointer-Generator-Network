Arrested: Ashley Zehnder, 24, allegedly had a months-long relationship with a male student

A high school teacher accused of having sex with a 17-year-old male cheerleader has not committed a crime, her lawyer has said.

Biology teacher and cheerleading coach Ashley Zehnder, 24, allegedly had a months-long relationship with the teen, who was a member of the cheerleading squad at Pasadena High School, Texas.

The age of consent in Texas is 17. 

'We believe she's innocent,' attorney Nicole DeBorde told the Houston Chronicle.

'We don't think any crime has been committed. They're saying [the alleged behavior] is inappropriate solely because of the teacher-student relationship.' 

Zehnder, who is in a long term relationship, was arrested on Friday on a charge of having an improper relationship with a male student. She is out on $10,000 bond. 

The student said their relationship, which started in May and lasted throughout the summer, began when he lost his cellphone and used Zehnder's to call it, police said.

Afterwards he saved her number to his phone and they began texting and started a relationship, court records said.

The relationship reportedly came to light after Zehnder sent the teenager naked photos on Snapchat, which he saved and reportedly showed to other students.

Claims: Zehnder, left with her boyfriend and right, resigned from the school earlier this month after being confronted with naked photos she had allegedly sent the student using Snapchat

Zehnder herself went to school administrators when she learned that a naked photo was being swapped among students, KTRK reported. 

Officials at Pasadena Independent School District began investigating on October 1 and when staff asked the boy how he got the image, he admitted she had sent it to him through Snapchat.

He also admitted to staff that they had been in a sexual relationship since May 2014, KHOU reported. 

Zehnder initially denied the relationship, but when confronted with the photograph, she admitted that she had sent the naked photo to the teenager through Snapchat.

She resigned from the school on October 9. 

'These charges are very serious and this behavior will not be tolerated in Pasadena ISD,' the district said in a statement. 

'When an educator violates the trust of a student, it makes it difficult for the majority of teachers who genuinely care for the safety and well-being of students.' 

According to Zehnder's Facebook page, she is in a long-term relationship. 

Her next court appearance is scheduled for December 2.
