It is a stunning sunset, and for researchers at the remote Concordia station in Antarctica, the last they will see for three months.

Staff at the base, operated by the European Space Agency, now face three months under artificial lighting.

The team admit the dark days are difficult to cope with - but claim the beautiful view of the stars make up for it.

The French–Italian Concordia station is used for scientific research.

Its programme of research includes glaciology, human biology and the atmosphere.

ESA uses the base to prepare for future long-duration missions beyond Earth.

During the winter, Concordia is under almost total darkness, with an average temperature of –51°C and a record low of –85°C.

It is an ideal place to study the effects on small, multicultural teams isolated for long periods in an extreme, hostile environment.

'The night brings darkness, promising a blackness to put fear in us, but
also supplying a great spectacle – the stars, the Milky Way and 
something even more amazing,' Crewmember Antonio Litterio said.

However, the revealed the onset of dark was made easier with the first aurora.

'Suspended over my head, is an incredible display, a long and winding trail that extends from the horizon,' he wrote.

'A green, living, moving thing.

'My visor clouds up and I take it off. My eyes do not hurt as they get burned by the cold, but even if you do not feel pain in Antarctica, at -65°C, you know it does not mean that the eyes are not suffering.

'I stay there watching that light high-in-the-sky for a bit longer.

'Once back inside and tucked in under the blankets, all sleep leaves the room and the insomnia of astonishment takes over.

'I cannot relax after the most incredible view my eyes have ever witnessed, my first Aurora.'

The base is one of the coldest spots in the world—temperatures barely 
rise over negative 13 degrees Fahrenheit in the summer, and they can 
drop down to negative 112 in the winter, which begins in July and lasts 
until September.

The base is built every year and prepared for three-quarters of a year of self-sufficient running.

Some areas can have sunlight for six months of the year, and night for the other six months.

Parts of Finland and Norway are among the most affected.

In some regions of Finland there is permanent daylight for 73 days during the summer.

Areas in Norway may also experience 24 hour daylight from April 19 though to mid-August.

In winter, these areas have what is called 'polar nights' - when the sun does not rise.

Places within 5 degrees of the Arctic Circles, or 60 degrees from the equator, may experience the opposite, known as 'white nights.'

This is a time when the sun remains at the horizon line, creating twilight instead of night.

White nights can last close to three weeks.

In St. Petersburg in Russia, there are festivals to celebrate white nights for 10 days at the end of June.

Food, fuel and equipment are ferried in over land and by air while personnel work on maintaining the base and its equipment.

The last plane left the base in February, signalling the start of winter and the isolation it brings.

Temperatures can drop to –80°C and the Sun does not rise above the horizon for around four months, leaving the base in permanent darkness.

'Far from entering a state of hibernation, the crew will be observing Earth’s climate in a unique location at the end of the world, the European Space Agency said.

Previous visitors to the station have captured stunning aurora, such as this one from 18 July 2012

'This year, the base will be operating at high capacity, with all but one of the winter beds filled by scientists and technicians.

'Astronomers, glaciologists, seismologists and a meteorologist are supported by a plumber, electrician, mechanic and cook, among others, to form a team and survive the long winter.'

ESA has also sent a medical doctor to study the multicultural crew as they adapt and work together.

This year, medical doctor Evangelos Kaimakamis from Greece is running eight experiments preparing for future spaceflight.

'For topics ranging from crew morale and efficiency to blood pressure and posture, Concordia provides an environment similar in some respects to spaceflight,' ESA said.

'Even materials that could be used in human spacecraft are tested there.'
