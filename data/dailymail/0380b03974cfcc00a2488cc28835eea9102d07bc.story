There is someone in every household who always forgets to turn off the lights or television before bed.

But rather than squabbling over it, families will soon have a simple solution.

A smart home system is on the way which allows householders to control  appliances by voice.

Samsung's smart house will enable people to turn off household appliances and lights using their smartphone or Galaxy Gear smartwatch. The fact the South Korean tech giant is pushing the smart home idea is expected to take the technology from the laboratory to the mass market

A simple ‘goodnight’ or ‘going out’ 
command will shut down all gadgets and turn off lights without the need 
to go around the house flicking switches.

The
 Samsung Smart Home was unveiled by the South Korean technological firm 
at the US Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas yesterday.

It
 enables smart televisions, home appliances and smartphones to be 
connected and managed together and will be introduced in the first half 
of this year.

Users will be 
able to access the system  through Samsung’s Galaxy Gear smartwatch, 
their TV remote control, a smartphone or by computer app.

The
 smart devices will alert owners to faults in the appliances, and they 
can even keep an eye on their homes while they are away. The system 
connects to cameras in smart TVs, fridges and dishwashers, which can 
then give the owner a glimpse at their home from anywhere via a 
smartphone.

And an 
application called device control will allow householders to turn air 
conditioning or lighting on or off by  phone, even when abroad.

Initially, the Samsung system will only work with its own brand of televisions, home appliances and smartphones.

It will then be expanded to include other manufacturers’ appliances.

Andy Griffiths, president of Samsung 
Electronics UK and Ireland, said: ‘With Samsung Smart Home, we are 
bringing our capabilities as the world’s number-one manufacturer of 
smart devices to make the connected home a reality for consumers today.’

A Samsung spokesman 
said: ‘Users will be able to control and manage their home devices 
through a single application by connecting personal and home devices, 
from refrigerators and washing machines to smart TVs, digital cameras, 
smartphones and even the wearable device Galaxy Gear, through an 
integrated platform and server.’

‘With
 Device Control, users can use customised settings on their mobile 
devices or Smart TV to monitor or control home devices - turning on air 
conditioning or activating lighting, for example - while inside or outside the home, or even while travelling abroad.

Samsung's range of home appliances includes a $3,499 (£2,332) smart fridge freezer (pictured), which is Wi-Fi enabled with an LCD screen carrying a series of Apps, including Google Calendar, recipes, weather and news, plus Twitter, which updates all the latest tweets from people you are following

‘At the touch of a dedicated Smart Home app icon on their device, the service enables users to control one or multiple devices simultaneously no matter where they are.

‘Smart Home also offers a voice command function on all the controller devices. If a user says ‘going out’ to his Galaxy Gear device, home lighting and selected appliances are turned off.

‘If the user says "goodnight" to their Smart TV remote control, the TV will be turned off and lights dimmed and gradually turned off. Users can also use chat control on their smartphone app as a fun, convenient way to communicate with their devices.  

‘With the service’s Home View feature, users can use their smartphone to get real-time views of the home via in-built appliance cameras.’

Initially, the Samsung Smart Home system will focus on its own Smart TVs, home appliances and smartphones. It will then be expanded to include appliances made by other manufacturers.

All the major electronics companies are working on their own smart home devices. In theory, people returning home from work will be able to turn on the lights, the heating, the oven or the washing machine.

It will also link to smart door locks, allowing people to open the front door by talking to their smartwatch or phone.

Samsung Smart Home, a service enabling Smart TVs, home appliances and smartphones to be connected and managed through a single integrated platform will be rolled out in the first half of this year.
