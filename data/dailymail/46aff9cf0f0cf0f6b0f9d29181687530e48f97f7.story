A cheeky seal took time out from battling Britain's stormy seas - by hopping onto his favourite fishing boat.

The whiskered mammal, nicknamed Sedrick, was caught on camera as he hoisted himself onboard for a well-earned rest. 

He has become a regular sight at Fremington Quay in Banstaple, Devon, where he regularly hops on and off the red-hulled vessel.

The grey seal normally uses his floating home as the perfect fishing spot, peering over the side then diving off to catch fish.

The remarkable video was shot by Maureen Bennett, a customer visiting the popular Fremington Quay Cafe, which overlooks the harbour.

The footage was posted on the cafe’s Facebook page where it generated hundreds of likes.

Owner Paul Duffy said: 'He has been a resident for the best part of the last two years.

'It depends on the tide as to when he comes. He always jumps on the exact same boat.

'He really helps us out because it is a long winter when the tourists aren’t around but to have something like that does wonders for the business.'

Last week a seal swam 20miles inland into the country market town of Monmouth in Wales after the river Wye burst its banks in the storms.

The seal which has been named Ron by surprised locals has also been spotted on flooded playing fields in the town.
