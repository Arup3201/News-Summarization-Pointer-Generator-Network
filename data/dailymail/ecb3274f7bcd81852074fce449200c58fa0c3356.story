A 26-year-old former champion volleyball player has laid claim to having the longest legs in New York, with her limbs measuring 47 inches from toe to hip.

Brooke Banker decided to find out how she measured up after British model Alexandra Robertson scooped her nation’s Miss Longest Legs last month, with a seemingly unbeatable 47 inches - and was surprised when her pins sized the same.

Although the 5ft 11in blonde has made a modelling career out of her lithe limbs, she says her statuesque frame often poses difficulties - especially when it comes to buying clothes, traveling long distances and finding romance.

Taking it in her stride: Leggy Brooke Banker has longest legs in New York - measuring a whopping 47 inches

She said: 'Traveling long distance by bus or airplane can be really uncomfortable because I never get enough leg room.

'I
 can only buy clothes from certain places - the higher end brands tend 
to fit me better so it can be quite expensive to get clothes that fit.'

As for the opposite sex, blue-eyed Miss Banker is single and has been told by friends that men often find her towering appearance intimidating.

'Traveling long distance by bus or airplane can be really uncomfortable because I never get enough leg room,' the blue-eyed blonde said

'I try not to think about it too much. 
And I don’t want to sound creepy, but I get approached by a lot of 
really short guys or guys with fetishes,' she told the New York Post.

Miss Banker began working with Monarch Agency, which represents male and female models, a year ago and her eye-popping legs have since been in fierce demand.

Monarch CEO Catherine Smith said: 'She definitely has the longest legs of any model that I’ve worked with.

'She’s the newest talent who we’re excited about. She’s super-sweet, professional, beautiful, and did I mention those amazing legs?'

More than a pretty face: In 2009 Miss Banker moved to Los Angeles to pursue a degree in aviation science with the intention of becoming an air traffic controller - but instead she got caught by the modelling bug

Career-minded: She now hopes her high profile pins will help her to land her dream job as a television presenter

To make sure her legs are in pristine condition, Miss Banker does yoga and spinning classes.

She said: 'I go to the gym four or five times per week where I do a variety of workouts.

'But trekking back and forth from castings and using the subway is also a good work out - working in New York keeps you fit.

'I moisturize daily to avoid dry skin and generally take care of myself.'

The ex-sportswoman, who used to play for the the elite national championship Penn State volleyball team, leaves her heels at home when she isn’t working to avoid unnecessary attention. 

She said: 'I generally only wear heels when I’m working - I don’t really need that extra boost.

'I like to go out in flat shoes when my friends are in heels so it evens out the height difference.'

Concluding about her prize assets, Brooklyn-born Miss Banker said: 'At 47 inches I’m right up there with Alexandra, but I’m not seeking to break any records.

'I’m proud and it’s been exciting seeing so much buzz around it but I would like to prove to people I’m more than just a pair of legs.

'I get lot of support from women who tell me they would love to have my height and legs.'
