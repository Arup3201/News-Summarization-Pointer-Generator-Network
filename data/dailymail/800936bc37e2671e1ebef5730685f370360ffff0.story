All three were included on the 15-book longlist which was revealed on Tuesday morning.

Thomas, the former captain of Wales and the British Lions who came out as gay in 2009, was longlisted for his autobiography Proud.

Football dominated with a total of eight titles on the longlist, including the biographies of Bobby Moore and Duncan Ferguson.

Graham Sharpe, co-founder of the award, said: 'There is something for everyone on this year’s longlist; from the inspirational, surprising and sometimes troubling stories behind some of our best-known sporting stars, to masterful social history and the more unusual subjects of ultra-running and golf-caddying.

'This diverse range of topics is testament to the fact that sports-writing is in rude health. I am also very pleased to see that three of the 15 longlisted titles are written by women – a first for a William Hill longlist – though I’d like to see an even greater share of voice for female writers in the future.'

The shortlist will be announced on October 24, with the winner later revealed on November 27.
