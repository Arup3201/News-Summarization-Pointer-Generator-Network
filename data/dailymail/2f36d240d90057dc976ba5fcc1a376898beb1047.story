Organisers of an interactive cinema screening of cult film Back To The Future have today promised to finally put performances on - one week after last-minute cancellations left thousands of fans disappointed.

Secret Cinema, the company behind the event, was forced to cancel the first week of screenings at the site in east London because it could not meet the technical requirements to satisfy local authorities.

'We are extremely sorry for the delayed communications of last week,' a Secret Cinema statement said. 'We know we let our audience down and will do everything we can to make it up to them.'

Performance venue: The site in Stratford, east London, where the interactive screenings are due to start this Thursday. More than 60,000 tickets were sold for the series of screenings

Movie set: The audience, many of whom are expected to attend in costume, walk around replicas of sets from the hit 1980s film as part of the Secret Cinema experience

Public apology: The tweet posted by Secret Cinema on Tuesday night, announcing the new start date for the performances. The group's founder said that they had been unable to satisfy safety requirements

In a notice on their Twitter account, the organisers posted: 'We apologise again for the cancellations and look forward to your visit.'

The series of screenings was due to begin on 24 July, but the first four
 nights were cancelled because 'we weren't able to get to the position 
in which we were able to open with the local authorities happy', founder
 Fabien Riggall told BBC news on Friday.

'Secret Cinema is a very different kind of 
experience to a normal concert or show, and it has taken longer to 
demonstrate to [the authorities] so they are happy,' Mr Riggall said.

The team behind the event have spent 
weeks building a replica of Hill Valley, the town where the film 
starring Michael J Fox was set, close to the Olympic Park in Stratford.

The event 
was billed as recreating the setting for the 1985 hit movie, with fans dressing up in 1950s period costumes and 
attending the 'Enchantment Under The Sea' prom, as well as watching a 
screening of the film.

The
 shows had been seen as a hot ticket with thousands logging on to snap 
up more than 60,000 tickets online. They cost £53.50 for those aged 
16-plus and family tickets cost £140. A preview evening last Wednesday was
 also pulled.

Today, Secret Cinema fans who missed out on last week's screenings took to Twitter and Facebook to express their frustration, with many still furious over the last-minute cancellations.

Outrage: Many Secret Cinema fans took to social media to express their frustration at last week's last-minute cancellations. Some ticket-holders were not informed until they arrived at the event

Fan favourite: More than 80 actors are involved in bringing the film, starring Michael J Fox, to life. The Secret Cinema team recreated the film's key set pieces and most recognisable props

Caught out: Many ticket-holders complained that they were left out of pocket due to travel and accommodation costs - on top of the ticket price - with some travelling from other parts of the UK

One user wrote on Twitter: 'Got tickets for Friday and not going now, huge farce'. Another warned: 'Don't get your hopes up just yet. I had my hopes smashed 2 hours b4 [sic] the start after travelling length of country!'

While on the Secret Cinema Facebook group, one user said that: 'Any decent event organiser wouldn't have put people through this.'

Last week, ticket-holders were left angry by the short notice given for the initial cancellations, with some not being told until they arrived at the east London site.

In an email sent to attendees who had paid for one of last week's screenings, the organisers said that they came across 'a number of issues'.

Big production: One of the buildings built on the east London site. Secret Cinema said those with tickets for the cancelled nights could attend another screening or get a refund

Interactive cinema: The team behind the event have spent weeks building a replica of Hill Valley, the town where the film starring Michael J Fox was set, close to the Olympic Park in Stratford

The email 
said: 'Secret Cinema has been running safe arts events for 10 years and 
on this occasion we have come across a number of issues that we have not
 experienced previously.

'As you can imagine we are hugely disappointed and share the immense frustration you are all feeling.'

Many 
ticket-holders complained that they were left out of pocket due to travel 
and accommodation costs - on top of the ticket price - with some travelling from other parts of the UK.

Among
 those who vented their frustration online was one woman who wrote: 'I 
cannot begin to tell you how devastated and disgusted I am. Thank you 
for ruining my husband's birthday and making a pregnant woman cry.'

In demand: The site before it opened. The shows had been seen as a hot ticket with thousands logging on to snap up more than 60,000 tickets online. They cost £53.50 for those aged 16-plus and family tickets cost £140

Cult classic: Christopher Lloyd as Dr Emmett Brown and Michael J. Fox as Marty McFly in a scene from the 1985 film. Some fans had travelled from overseas to attend the Secret Cinema screenings last week

Some said they had come from overseas and were unable to attend later performances.

One
 ticketholder said: 'I have six friends who left their phones in their 
hotel like you told them to. Combined cost of train, hotel, entry 
£1000+.'

And
 another wrote: 'After telling people that mobile phones and similar 
devices would not be allowed on site, how many people do you think were 
at Hackney Wick clueless to the fact you sent an email with less than a 
couple of hours notice informing of cancellation? Not really a smart 
move.'

Secret Cinema said those with tickets for the cancelled nights could attend another screening or get a refund.

Additional refunds in excess of ticket charges for those who travelled from overseas are being considered on a case-by-case basis.
