Being the younger sister of Nicole Richie certainly has its perks, but it also has a few setbacks.

In the latest issue of Elle, 16-year-old Sofia Richie strikes a pose in a patterned dress and powder pink coat, showing off her newly-dyed blonde tresses as she reveals what it was like to grow up in the Richie household.

'My dad [Lionel Richie] is more strict because of my sister. I feel like now he's on the preventative side,' she said.

Meet Nicole Richie's littler sister: In the latest issue of Elle, 16-year-old Sofia Richie strikes a pose in a patterned dress and powder pink coat as she reveals what it was like to grow up in the Richie household

The stylish teen added: 'It's not like I'm doing anything bad, but he went through all that with Nicole, so he's just strict to prevent it from happening again.'

And so far, so good. While Nicole, now 33, had already been arrested for drug possession and gone through a stint in rehab by the time she hit 22, Sofia seems to be far too occupied with her many ambitions.

'I want to do design, fashion, and music,' she says. 'Singing has always been the biggest passion for me. It runs in my family!'

Of course these days, Nicole - who has two children with her Good Charlotte rocker husband Joel Madden - has left her rebellious ways behind, and she's eager to help Sofia avoid the mistakes she once made.

Sofia says of the former Simple Life star, who is 17 years her senior: 'Nicole will always give me guidance as a big sister. She tells me every day that she’s mad that I'm growing up.'

And it's not just life advice that her older sibling gives her; when it comes to fashion, Sofia says Nicole is a definite influence - especially when it comes to patterns and flowy dresses.

Nicole has said in the past that her parents' loose upbringing was a main factor that led to her poor decisions in her youth, and she's determined not to let her own children get away with too much.

Indeed, her younger sister says that as a parent, Nicole 'has always been kind of strict...Not in a mean way, but she definitely has that curfew mentality - she's a smart mom.'

Famous friends: Sofia counts Kylie (pictured in August) and Kendall Jenner as some of her pals

Despite her associations with Nicole, Sofia is becoming a style icon on her own merit, with nearly 500,000 followers on Instagram. 

And while she says she hangs out with plenty of friends who aren't associated with the 'Hollywood scene,' she does count Kylie and Kendall Jenner as some of her pals.

However, you likely won't catch her wearing the scandalous looks that have gotten those teens in hot water.

'My style is edgy, but really put together,' she says. 'I'm not the kind of girl to walk out of the house in booty shorts and a crop top and Converse. I don't like that look.'
