Real Madrid's relentless drive to dominate football for the next decade shows no signs of abating.

Far from resting on their Champions League laurels they are about to sign 18-year-old Marco Asensio from Mallorca, snatching him from Barcelona in the process.

The Spain Under 19 midfielder is a Barça fan and looked destined to switch to the Nou Camp in the summer but amid suggestions Barcelona wanted to pay in instalments, Real  have since stepped in with a firm £3million  offer to grab him from their rivals.

The player was also being monitored by Arsenal, Manchester United and Chelsea.

'I have decided to go to Madrid and I am happy with my decision,' he said on Sunday night after appearing for Mallorca against Sporting Gijon. 

The player will stay at Mallorca until the end of this campaign on loan. Real will take him back at the end of the season but Mallorca will be able to take another Real  youth teamer on loan in his place as part of the deal.

The skilful left-footed midfielder is so highly rated by Real  that they have included a clause in his contract that for an extra 800,000 euros (£635,000) they can take him in January and fast-track him straight into their first team squad if they are hit by injuries between now and the closing of the winter transfer window.

The move is not just a success for Real  but another failure for Barcelona who looked close to signing the player in the summer only to miss out six months later.

Asensio was called up to Spain's Under 19 last month and is expected to be fast-tracked to the Under 21 team as they rebuild after their failure to reach the U21 European Championship.

Sergio Canales' move to Real did not work out and he is now at Real Sociedad under David Moyes

He must now work to ensure his dream move doesn't end as Sergio Canales' did. 

He was signed by Madrid in similar circumstances in January 2010 from Racing Santander. He stayed there until the end of the season and joined Real the following summer. 

But the 19-year-old failed to develop at Madrid where first-team chances among so many big signings were few and far between. Jose Mourinho picked him in his first game in charge, against Mallorca, but he soon fell out of favour and injuries also became a problem.

Aged 23, Canales is now at Real Sociedad under David Moyes. 

Real hope this time the boy wonder will fulfil his potential and not have to leave Madrid to do so.
