The roast potatoes are crisping up nicely; the turkey is turning a perfect shade of brown. All the trimmings are ready to serve and even the kids are looking forward to the sprouts.

Don’t fancy a traditional Christmas dinner this year? Let them eat cake!

That’s what everything on this festive plate is made from, right down to the pigs-in-blankets and those mouth-watering baby carrots.

Feast: This family start to dig in to a Christmas dinner which is made solely from cake, provided by cakes4funshop.co.uk

The turkey may look real, but it’s actually a multi-layer sponge. The sprouts are little chocolate cakes in disguise; the cranberries are made from sugar paste. And if you’re still hungry after that, you can eat the plate.

It’s the brainchild of cake designer Carolyn White, who swapped a grown-up job in advertising 12 years ago to start a business aimed at putting the fun back into baking.

Her alternative Christmas offering took more than 40 hours to create, not counting the days of brain-racking that went into perfecting a feast that’s not quite what it seems.

A three-strong team led by Lydia Patrice at Carolyn’s London-based firm Cakes 4 Fun crafted it using familiar ingredients such as marzipan, sponge, jam and chocolate.

‘It’s one of the more unusual things we’ve created,’ says Carolyn, who also runs a cake school that teaches up to 5,000 pupils a year.

‘We’ve made all sorts of food — sushi, a cheeseboard, burgers — as well as sexy cakes you wouldn’t want to describe in a family newspaper.

‘It’s a bit of fun and we hope it will encourage more people to became interested in making cakes.’

constructed like a giant, oblong sandwich with alternate layers of 
sponge, vanilla butter cream and raspberry preserve.

2ft rolling pin, then crafted into a roast turkey shape.

Tinted with liquid food colouring using an airbrush technique; glazed with edible food glaze.

The Fake-Off turkey weighs as much as a real one — 14lb (just over 6kg).

First step: Lydia Patrice, lead chef at cakes4funshop, cuts the sponge into shape

Carved: The cake is sliced into shape and covered in buttercream

Icing on the cake: Patrice lays a huge sheet of fondant icing over her creation

Shaping: She then moulds the sheet expertly around the turkey cake

Finishing touches: Finally, she sprays on liquid food glaze to give the bird the proper colour

It may look real, but every element of this meal - from the carrots to the bird to the plates - is made of cake and icing
