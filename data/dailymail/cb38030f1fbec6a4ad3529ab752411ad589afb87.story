Adorning a large section of a wall in the gym beneath Twickenham’s West Stand is a picture of the England team smiling for the cameras and showing off the Triple Crown.

It was taken last year and the expressions worn by captain Chris Robshaw and his colleagues convey a genuine sense of pride. That silver shield has eluded the national team this year, following defeat in Dublin, but it is not the precious metal they covet anyway.

On head coach Stuart Lancaster’s watch, the trophy cabinet has been kept stocked. In the course of three years, in addition to the Triple Crown, England have lifted the Calcutta Cup (annually), the Millennium Trophy, the Cook Cup and the Hillary Shield. The latter prize, for beating New Zealand in December, 2012, was received with special relish.

But what the coaches and players really crave is a cup that conveys meaningful achievement, and at last that is within their grasp. Robshaw summed up the mood: ‘As a player you want to be picking up silverware. We've collected the odd bit here and there, but to pick up the main trophy would be great.’

The ‘main trophy’, newly commissioned, for winning the RBS 6 Nations is England’s for the taking. Success would also end a generation of under-achievement.

It is staggering that the world’s wealthiest rugby country has had so little to show for so much effort and investment in the modern era. England won three of the first four RBS 6 Nations titles (2000, 2001, 2003) but since then have finished top just once in 11 seasons.

So near, but so far has been the story of many English campaigns, not least under the current regime. Three times Lancaster’s men have finished runners-up, with four wins out of five. Wales (twice), and France have derailed the Sweet Chariot on its route to a Grand Slam. Everyone in the Red Rose camp has grown weary of the perennial talk about the need for ‘tangible’ reward, to use lock Geoff Parling’s apt phrase.

Defeat by Ireland shattered the latest quest for a clean sweep to propel the host nation into their World Cup, but England are still in prime position in terms of the three-way title tussle. This year, four wins from five should be sufficient to clinch the trophy, which will be at Twickenham in anticipation of a coronation at about 7pm.

There is a replica at Murrayfield, just in case Ireland run amok and beat Scotland with room to spare and leave England chasing a points-difference tally that proves beyond them.

Meanwhile, in Rome, Wales will expect to benefit from the enforced absence of Italy captain Sergio Parisse but they would require French and Scottish resistance on an epic scale to take the title.

The made-for-TV staggered schedule affords Lancaster’s side the luxury of a precise target but that could be a blessing or a curse. Being aware of the bigger picture could be a distraction for some England players, hence the coaches’ desire to burden only a select few with the main decision-making responsibilities.

It will be up to Robshaw and his half-backs, Ben Youngs and George Ford, to set a patient tone once what is needed has been explained to the whole squad before their pre-match warm-up. The remarkable maturity of England No 10 Ford, at just 22, should be a telling asset on a day when the challenge is equal parts mental and physical.

Philippe Saint-Andre’s France team do not boast glorious form, far from it, despite the emphatic 29-0 victory over Italy in Rome last weekend. Crucially, that game took place 24 hours after England beat Scotland and since then Les Bleus have had to fly home, patch themselves up and catch the Eurostar to London, while also dealing with the distraction of a club v country row over fly-half Camille Lopez.

What the visitors will bring is physical presence. The French are massive but this English pack has dealt with all-comers in recent times, and the graduated return of Courtney Lawes and Parling in the second row should add dynamism and line-out nous to the mix.

Behind the packs, England are more settled and threatening. Jonathan Joseph’s match-up with Gael Fickou will be intriguing, but only if the French threequarters are let off the leash. Ford can make holes in the Gallic defence but England cannot afford to be as wasteful as they were in beating Scotland.

Replacements could also have a big say and England will look to the likes of Tom Youngs and Nick Easter to generate momentum, Tom Wood to provide physicality and leadership, and Richard Wigglesworth to make an impact with his astute kicking game. Whether or not Danny Cipriani and Billy Twelvetrees play a part in a points chase, time will tell.

Amid the maelstrom, the primary demand from Lancaster will be for cool English heads. Robshaw should have plenty of leadership support, from Parling and a raft of club captains in the ranks: Joe Marler and Dylan Hartley, James Haskell and Ben Youngs.

There may be several rookies in white, but there are also enough established players. Together, they can ensure that the plot is not lost and that the ‘main trophy’ is won.
