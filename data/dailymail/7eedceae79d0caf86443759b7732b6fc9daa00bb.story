She's the ultimate safe pair of hands, the calm, cool doyenne of breakfast TV but life hasn't always been as effortless as it might appear for presenter Lorraine Kelly.

The 53-year-old has revealed that her incredible success has come at a cost. So consumed was the Glaswegian TV star by her career, she missed out on precious moments with daughter Rosie and says that at times she was 'desperate' to be with her.

'I did suffer terribly from "working mother guilt" especially when Rosie was little,' the mother-of-one told Woman & Home magazine.

'I remember sitting on delayed trains, desperate to be back at home with her. Although I've always turned up for work and never asked for time off. 

'The only time I did was when Rosie was two and a half and playing Mary in the school nativity. My radio bosses at the time said I couldn't go but I took it off anyway and have never regretted it.'

Although she was able to take the occasional day off, Lorraine spent most of Rosie's early years establishing a hugely successful TV career, that has included stints on TV-am, GMTV, ITV Breakfast and Daybreak.

At the same time, Lorraine was also dealing with the aftermath of a devastating miscarriage that saw her rushed to hospital, dangerously ill, when Rosie was just five years old.

As a result, she and Rosie, who is now 19 and appears with her mother in the October issue of Woman & Home, share an extraordinarily close bond.

Not that Rosie, like most teenagers, has any qualms about teasing her mother. 'My mum's no domestic goddess – she can't even cook an egg,' she reveals. 'But she is wonderful at cheering me up and being bonkers in the nicest possible way!'

'Her most annoying habit is she
dances around the kitchen with her hips swaying, singing away, not 
knowing the correct song lyrics. I have to leave the room!'

Despite her lack of cooking and singing skills, Lorraine's dedication to giving Rosie a happy, stable childhood has manifested in other ways, including avoiding red carpet events in order to make sure her daughter's life remained stable. 

'I want to give Rosie as "normal" an upbringing as possible, so try to avoid red carpet events and star studded parties,' says Lorraine.

'When she was growing up I was just 'Rosie's Mum'. No one took a second glance at the school gates and that's how it should be.'
