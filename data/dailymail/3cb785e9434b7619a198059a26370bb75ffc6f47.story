In the frame: Tim Davie is acting head of the BBC. He has to decide if senior staff will go in the wake of the Newsnight scandal

The former Pepsi Cola marketing man dramatically placed in temporary charge of the BBC will today have to decide on whether to authorise a new round of blood letting – with a host of senior managers facing the axe.

Tim Davie, 45, has been handed a report into Newsnight’s botched investigation that wrongly linked a senior politician to child abuse allegations in North Wales.

Up to six senior staff members could be jettisoned in the wake of director general George Entwistle’s sudden departure over the November 2 programme.

Mr Davie, who has no journalistic experience, now finds himself running the world’s best-known broadcaster even though he did not make the final round of interviews when he applied to be director general this year.

His first task will be to assess the report by BBC Scotland’s Ken MacQuarrie into how the Newsnight investigation went so terribly wrong.

Last night BBC Trust chairman Lord Patten warned that the two current internal inquiries – one on the dropped Jimmy Savile report and the other on North Wales – ‘may involve people’s jobs as well’.

But there are growing fears among senior staff that the corporation is ‘rudderless’ and there is a power vacuum at the top of the organisation.

Newsnight editor Peter Rippon last month ‘stepped aside’ as the corporation probed the bloody aftermath of the decision to drop an investigation last year into the Savile claims.

Acting editor Liz Gibbons faced tough questioning by the MacQuarrie inquiry which is looking into how the discredited film led to Tory peer Lord McAlpine being wrongly labelled a paedophile on the internet.

Adrian Van Klaveren, Miss Gibbons’s boss, who was drafted in to keep an eye on ‘Savile-related’ material after Mr Rippon’s departure, is also facing a nervous morning today.

The controller of Radio 5 Live referred the story up to an executive on the management board, BBC Northern Ireland’s Peter Johnston, who is a former management consultant.

There is also continued speculation about the future of the corporation’s director of news Helen Boaden, her deputy Stephen Mitchell and director of editorial policy David Jordan.

Candidates: Lord Patten has called for the new appointment to be made in the next few weeks

Last night, as recriminations continued to rage, it emerged that a host of the BBC’s most famous presenters are on the ‘warpath’ telling the corporation’s top bosses they must ‘get a grip’.

They pointed out that the decision, post Savile, to effectively sideline executives such as Miss Boaden, who spent last weekend on a walking holiday, has left the corporation bereft of high-level journalist experience.

Mr Davie is described by BBC Chairman Lord Patten as ‘a very good man’ and is no stranger to media scandals.

He was in charge of BBC radio when the 
Andrew Sachs scandal erupted in 2008 with Jonathan Ross and Russell 
Brand leaving lewd messages on the actor’s answerphone.

Although he initially described Ross and
Brand as ‘brilliant entertainers’ the former Ross did not have his 
lucrative contract renewed and the latter quit.

Condemnation: Tory MP Philip Davies described the BBC as in a ¿terrible state¿

Lord Patten, clearly aware of the criticism about Mr Davie’s lack of editorial experience, has spoken of the need to surround a director general with people that can make the job ‘doable’.

Ben Bradshaw, a Labour MP who sits on the Culture select committee in the Commons, speculated on further sackings, saying: ‘I think it cannot end here.’

Tory MP John Whittingdale told BBC Radio 4 yesterday: ‘If George Entwistle was unaware of the programme, which he says he was, then clearly somebody below him took the decision that it was right to broadcast it.

‘That was a terrible decision and people need to take responsibility for that. So potentially it may require other people to resign.’

Conservative MP Philip Davies claimed last night claimed that in recent weeks it had looked like ‘there was no one running the BBC’ saying the corporation was in a ‘terrible state’.

Last night a BBC Trust spokesman said: ‘The BBC Trust has this evening had a discussion with the acting director general, Tim Davie, and we are looking forward to him setting out tomorrow his plans for dealing with some of the issues arising from the November 2 Newsnight broadcast as a first step in restoring public confidence.’
