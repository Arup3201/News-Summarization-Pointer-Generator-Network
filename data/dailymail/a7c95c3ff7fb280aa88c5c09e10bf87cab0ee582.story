Elizabeth Smart's sister Mary Katherine has long been seen in the kidnapping victim's shadow, but after her appearance during an hour-long special about the ordeal, it is clear that she is all grown up.

Mary Katherine spoke to Meredith Vieira about the night in June 2002 when her sister was taken from the bed they shared and how she tried her best to go unnoticed.

'If he realizes I'm awake, maybe he'll take me as well and then my family will never know what happened to us,' she recalls thinking to herself.

Then and now: Mary Katherine was 9 when the kidnapping occurred (left) and now she is 20-years-old (right)

Mary Katherine was only 9-years-old when her then-14-year-old sister Elizabeth was taken by Brian David Mitchell.

Now she is all grown up and 20-years-old, with long blonde hair just like her older sister.

During the NBC interview, which aired Friday night, Mary Katherine and her mother Lois told how the beginning of that horrible night was a normal one in the Smart household.

She and her sister shared a bed, and Elizabeth was happily playing the big-sister role by reading Ella Enchanted to Mary Katherine.

She recalled: 'I was begging and crying and just so scared. I remember thinking, I know what comes after a wedding. And that cannot happen to me. That cannot happen'

Bond of sisters: On the night of her kidnapping, Elizabeth had stayed up late reading to Mary Katherine from Ella Enchanted

In the middle of the night, a man walked into their room and threatened Elizabeth with a knife against her neck.

'I felt immediately awake. I could feel or sense my sister lying in bed next to me, she was asleep. I was so scared,' Elizabeth said during the interview.

Mary Katherine told Vieira that she tried to lay as still as possible to make sure that she would not get taken as well, but then still knew she needed to get out of bed eventually to help her sister.

'I was just trying to work up enough courage to run into my parents room and tell them what happened,' she said.

When she went into her parents' bedroom and raised the alarm- saying simply 'Elizabeth's gone'- it didn't seem real to her parents.

Holding out hope: Mary Katherine was the one who remembered- four months after Elizabeth had been taken- that the captor could have been the man named Emmanuel who had done some handiwork around the house

'Hearing those words coming from a sound sleep, it's like "Oh, she's had a bad dream" and when she continued "No, she really is gone," I got up and went running down the stairs and my first view was at the window and the screen was, I could tell it had been cut,' Lois said.

Not only was Mary Katherine the one to first alert her parents, but she ended up being the one to provide the pivotal final clue.

Four months after her sister had been taken, Mary Katherine suddenly realized that she remembered the man who was in their bedroom that night.

'I was just waiting for my dad to come in to tuck me into bed. I was just thinking like maybe who could it possibly be and Emmanuel just popped into my head,' she said.

Critical: Mary Katherine helped them come up with the sketch that they released, which later helped them identify Elizabeth's captor- Brian David Mitchell

Emmanuel was the name that Brian David Mitchell had told the Smarts when they offered to pay him to do some handiwork around the house after Lois saw him begging on the street months before the kidnapping.

With Mary Katherine's realization, the Smarts were able to get a sketch of Mitchell and pushed for police to immediately release it.

Officials were hesitant because they were following another lead, but eventually they succumbed and the sketch aired on America's Most Wanted.

A short while later, a woman called in a tip saying that she thought she spotted that man in a Utah Walmart. She ended up being right, and when Mitchell, his wife Wanda Barzee and a well-covered Smart were brought into a police station, the kidnapped teenager was finally reunited with her father.
