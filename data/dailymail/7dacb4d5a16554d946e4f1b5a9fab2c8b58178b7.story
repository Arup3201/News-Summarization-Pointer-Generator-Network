The 6ft 6ins-tall grandson of Hollywood's King of Cool Steve McQueen is trying to make it as a goalkeeper in the UK stopping shots for a non-league team.

Chase McQueen, 19, the son of Steve's son Chad McQueen, arrived in the UK earlier this year from Los Angeles to play in goal for Hertfordshire team Cheshunt FC.

The teenager, whose grandfather died in 1980 after starring in Bullit and The Great Escape, has also been playing for London Tigers FC, an Ealing-based team which plays in the Spartan South Midlands League Premier Division.

The glovesman was given a chance between the sticks by Lee Williamson, the director of Cheshunt FC, and manager Omer Riza.

Chase said: 'It has always been a dream of mine to come to England and play. There's no better place in the world.

'It's a great sport all round and footballers are the greatest athletes. The feeling when you get on the pitch is like nothing else.'

Chase started his footballing career at the Hollywood All-Stars, before leaving America to play at the academy of Croatian team Dinamo Zagreb.

Cheshunt manager Omer Riza, whose team play in the Isthmian League Division One North, said: 'He is a good young player. He holds himself well and gets on with his job.'

Chase said he wanted to 'write his own path' rather than following in the footsteps of his famous family - and wants to play in the Premier League. 

King of Cool: Steve McQueen starred as Detective Frank Bullitt in the film Bullitt, 1978 

Speaking earlier this month, the teenager said he didn't want to go into Hollywood, like grandfather Steve McQueen or actor and producer dad Chad, who starred as Dutch in The Karate Kid.

His brother Steven R McQueen is also actor, starring in TV show The Vampire Diaries and movie Piranha 3D.

Chase, however - a huge fan of US keeper Brad Friedel and Tim Howard - moved from the sun-kissed beaches of Malibu to play in non-league football to carve out his own legacy between the sticks.

He said: 'I wanted to write my own story - I wanted to make my own path.

'Acting and trying to live up to my grandfather's legacy wouldn't be fair to me. Nobody could ever live up to what he has done with his life.'

He told the US-based International Soccer Network: 'I want to be playing in the Premier League in five years. That's the goal.'

Chase initially fell in love with basketball, but switched to football to play as glovesman while at Malibu High School.

There he met goalkeeping coach Edi Mujic, a former pro from Germany, who started to mentor the young keeper.

Mr Mujic said of Chase: 'Chase's development in the past three years has been equivalent to any other double in time.

'His potential is deeper as well. His passion is tremendous and his work ethic is absolutely remarkable.'

Chase joined the Dinamo Zagreb Academy in Croatia, the Hollywood All-Stars, and now Cheshunt FC in Herts, where he is currently on load to London Tigers FC.

Omer Riza, the manager of Cheshunt FC, and a former Arsenal and West Ham player, said: 'I'm always open to looking at players as it doesn't hurt and you never know what can be unearthed, maybe a diamond in the rough.

'Chase worked hard throughout preseason and has given a good account of himself both as a player and an individual.'

'I've also had the pleasure of meeting his family in brief and they thanked me for looking after Chase. My reply was 'he has looked after himself and is a credit to you guys.

'This is very true, a young guy who has it all and didn't need to come to the UK and try and make something of himself.'
