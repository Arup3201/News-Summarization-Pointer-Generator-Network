Kieran Clough, who used a fake name to contact a teenager of Facebook, despite being banned from using the web as part of a sexual prevention order imposed on him 

A mother who posed as her teenage daughter to trap an online pervert reacted in fury yesterday as judges refused for a second time to send him to prison.

Kieran Clough, 24, had planned to meet the woman’s 15-year-old daughter, after sending her explicit messages online.

He was on his way to see the girl, armed with a knuckle duster, a police baton, a book on sex toys and a bottle of vodka, when he was arrested by officers who had been alerted by the mother.

But despite being warned that Clough was ‘at high risk of reoffending’, a judge let him off with a supervision order.

Months after avoiding a jail term, Clough contacted another young girl online, posing as a teenager called Bella. 

He was caught out, but the garage worker has been allowed to walk free by a judge yet again.

The first victim’s mother expressed her anger at the ‘lenient’ criminal justice system and called for Clough to be jailed to protect other children. 

She said he would prey on young girls ‘again and again’ if judges only gave him a ‘slap on the wrist’.

Using a fake name, Clough had tried to lure the woman’s daughter into meeting him by sending her intimate pictures of himself on Facebook and offering to buy her presents in return for sex.

But his plan was foiled when the horrified mother, who cannot be named for legal reasons, found the messages and arranged a meeting, pretending to be her daughter. 

The mother, from Wearside, said: 'I knew he would do it again.

'The sentence he got was too lenient in the first place.

'He was supposed to be banned from using the internet but unless somebody is there with him 24/7 it is easy for it to happen again.

'It makes me realise there there is something wrong with the system for him to go out and do it again. He is a very dangerous boy.'

Durham Crown Court heard that despite being subject to the order and three-year community supervision, Clough, posing as ‘Bella Swinton’, contacted the 14-year-old girl via social media in August.

He claimed to know her and asked her to send a photo of her bedroom, ‘to ensure she was on her own’.

Katherine Dunn, prosecuting, told the court how Clough exchanged messages with the girl for two weeks, before eventually revealing ‘Bella’ was really a boy and telling her to delete their conversations.

Miss Dunn said the girl asked if he was ‘that paedo arrested last year’ and Clough agreed, saying it had been ‘a mistake’.

But the girl told her mother and Clough was arrested by police.

The mother of the 15-year-old girl (both are pictured in silhouette to protect their identities) who was groomed online by Kieran Clough has said she 'knew he would do it again'

He refused to give officers the password to his phone or computer and to answer their questions.

Miss Dunn added: 'This was deliberate contact, targeting a young girl, aware of her age and identity, directly flouting the terms of the previous order.'

Clough admitted breaching the order and has remained in custody since his arrest on August 11.

Tony Davis, defending, told the court how Clough has a hearing impediment which requires him to lip read, and this may have partly caused his social immaturity.

Mr Davis said: 'Clearly the behaviour in the original case was more serious than this.

'But, it has brought about what everyone was trying to avoid, namely the incarceration of this young man for more than two months now.

'Contacting girls younger than him, under the age of 16, was something of a pre-occupation, but that was because of his inability to form relationships with girls his own age.'

Durham Crown Court heard that despite being the subject of a sexual prevention order, Clough posed as 'Bella Swinton' to contact the girl on Facebook

Recorder Jeremy Hill-Baker said as Clough has spent more than two months in custody he could impose a three-year community supervision order during which he will undergo intensive sex offender treatment work.

He was also made subject of a new sexual prevention order, and must register as a sex offender, both for five years.

It was last year that the mother of Clough’s first victim discovered the older man had been attempting to groom her daughter for sex via Facebook.

She said was horrified to overhear her young daughter telling friends she had been to meet a 21-year-old man she had been speaking to on Facebook - and then demanded to see the messages between them.

She spoke of how she was sickened to read the sexually explicit exchanges between her impressionable daughter and Clough - who knew the girl was 15 all along.

The mother intercepted the messages and arranged a meeting with the Clough.

He turned up with a car full of weapons and a book about sex and was arrested.

When officers searched the garage worker’s home and found a stash of over 900 child porn images and seven movies on his computer.

He admitted grooming, possessing indecent photographs of children and having offensive weapons, but walked free from Newcastle Crown Court last September.
