The world's super-rich are turning their backs on posh boutiques and are opting to spend their millions on luxury experiences instead, according to a new report.

The richest people on the planet are no longer satisfied with owning luxury, they now want to experience it by forking out for unusual adrenalin-filled holidays, gourmet dining and art.

In total, of the $1.8tn (£1.1tn) spent on luxury last year, up to $1tn (£0.6tn) went towards extreme holidays, fine wining and dining, attending art auctions and other pricey activities.

The world's super-rich spent more money on experiences than luxury material goods during 2013

This graph shows how the super-rich's spending was divided in 2013 with more cash being spent on travel and 'experiential luxury' as opposed to personal luxury goods like jewellery and leather goods

Experts have said that what is considered 'luxury' is switching from 'having' to 'being'.

The Boston Consulting Group's report has
 said that the world's richest want to spend their wealth on things 
money usually can't buy.

Private airline flights

Luxury slimming clinics

Five-star hospitals which offer a butler service

Adrenalin-filled holidays such as trips to the Antarctic and tailor-made safaris

Gourmet dining

Fine art and wine

‘They already have the luxury toys; the cars and the jewellery,’ said BCG senior partner Antonella Mei-Pochtler, explaining why super-rich spending is changing, according to The Guardian.

The paper said private airline flights, luxury slimming clinics, five-star hospitals and butlers were on the list of things to spend on during the year.

But there was still room for the super-rich to invest in the material, with spending on luxury cars standing at around $400bn (£240bn).

Nearly as much was spent in the rest of the personal luxury goods market.

Around $50bn (£30bn) was spent on cosmetics, $150bn (£91bn) on watches and jewellery and at least $60bn (£36bn) on apparel.

The super rich are spending less on material goods such as jewellery, clothes and leather goods

Despite the switch towards spending on experience, the report showed  (£240bn) was spent on luxury cars

And BCG has predicted that the personal luxury goods market will grow at a rate of around 7 per cent annually over the next two years.

Together, the Chinese, Brazilians, Russians and Indians account for more than 30 per cent of luxury consumption, according to the paper.

The report also shows that $460bn (£280bn) was spent on rare travel opportunities, including trips to the Antarctic.

Some $170bn (£100bn), meanwhile, was spent on the more predictable designer clothes and handbags.

One Chinese 
multimillionaire spent £900,000 on a tailor-made package holiday
 that took him to 1,000 UNESCO heritage sites and that lasted for two years, according to The Guardian.

There is a growing ‘sugar generation’ which describes the young rich consumers 
in China.

They currently account for 13 per cent of the nation's super-rich – but this is expected to rise to 
30 per cent within five years.

Also included in the spending report was Louis Vuitton owner LVMH who spent $2.6bn (£1.6bn) buying cashmere clothier Loro Piana.

He also acquired Nicholas Kirkwood, J.W. Anderson, and Hotel Saint-Barth Isle de France in the Caribbean during the year.
