Police have rescued 36 young girls from a house in Pakistan after they were taken hostage from their school in a bizarre debt row involving their teacher.

Officers found the girls, aged between eight and 14, after they had been secretly moved to the capital Karachi from their rural madrassa without their parents' knowledge.

The children were reportedly boarding at the school under the supervision of a teacher who was in dispute with the owner of the house over non-payment of a debt.

The teacher, named by local media as Hameeda, is said to have loaned 200,000 rupees (£2,000) to the man who had reneged on promises to repay it.

Hameeda reportedly responded by arranging for the girls to be taken to the debtor's house in the Liaquatabad area of the city, where he she insisted he look after them until the money was repaid.

Local media reports have offered conflicting reasons for her actions. 

Some claim Hameeda intended for the girls to stay at the house until she had recouped the money through savings she made by no longer having to look after them at her madrassa.

Others say she was using them as leverage to force him to pay the money back directly.

The girls were taken into care by the Senior Superintendent of Police and are being returned to their families, who learned of their disappearance yesterday.

Two men have been arrested for their alleged involvement in transporting the girls to Karachi.  

The madrassa owner reportedly told police that she regularly took the children to Karachi to further their education.

She claimed that she also arranged marriages of poor girls in the tribal region, it was reported by www.dawn.com.
