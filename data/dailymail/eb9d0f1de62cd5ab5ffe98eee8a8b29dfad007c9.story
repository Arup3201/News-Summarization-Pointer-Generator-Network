A powerful new drug slashes 'bad' cholesterol levels to those seen in a newborn baby, a study has found.

Alirocumab has been hailed as one of the most important drugs to tackle bad cholesterol since statins were introduced.

It could drastically reduce the risk of heart attacks and stroke, researchers claim.

Researchers say the drug works 'a bit like Pac Man', as it gobbles up a protein which prevents the liver from using up bad cholesterol.

The new drug, called Alirocumab, slashes 'bad' cholesterol levels to those seen in a newborn baby. The 'powerful' drug could drastically reduce the risk of heart attacks and stroke, researchers claim

It can be used in people who are taking statins but need an extra 'boost' or as an alternative to statins in those who cannot tolerate them. 

A study found it all but eliminated dangerous blood fats called lipoprotein (LDL) – known as 'bad' cholesterol – in almost a third of people already taking statins.

In people unable to tolerate statins, Alirocumab halved bad cholesterol levels, reducing the risk of these killer diseases.

Statins don't work for some people, and others experience a host of common side effects including feeling sick, constipation and diarrhoea, muscle and joint pain, and an increased risk of type 2 diabetes.

The global study of nearly 2,400 people showed more than a third of people given Alirocumab saw their level of fats fall to those seen in a baby.

'Alirocumab, when used alongside a statin, will dramatically lower cholesterol,' lead researcher Professor Kausik Ray, of St George's Hospital, London, told MailOnline.

'Around 40 per cent of people who took it saw their levels reduce to that of a newborn.' 

He called the drug 'powerful' and said is likely to reduce the risk of heart disease - but added the risk is not going to be totally abolished. 

'If you take the best dose of statin, you get a 50 per cent lowering of bad cholesterol. With Alirocumab, you get a 50 - 60 per cent reduction.

'In combination, you could see a 75 per cent reduction in bad cholesterol levels. Other drugs that we've got only give a 20 per cent reduction.

'That's why it's so powerful. You get more bang for your buck.'

He described the drug as working 'a bit like Pac Man' as it gobbles up a protein called PCSK9, which prevents the liver from using up bad cholesterol. 

Statins are a group of medicines that can help lower the level of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in the blood.

LDL cholesterol is often referred to as bad cholesterol', and statins stop it being produced inside the liver.

This prevents the arteries becoming clogged with fatty deposits, which could lead to heart attacks and stroke in the long run. 

In July, NICE urged GPs to offer statins to anyone with a 10 per cent risk of developing heart disease within a decade.

The advice means 17.5 million adults, including most men aged over 60 and women over 65, are now eligible to take the tablets, which cost less than 10p a day.

But leading GPs, cardiologists and academics are concerned that not enough is known about side effects which include memory problems, dizziness, type 2 diabetes and muscular pain. 

They point out that very little research has been carried out into these risks and how many patients are affected.

It has also emerged that six of the 12 experts drawing up the guidelines have financial ties to drugs firms who make statins or similar pills.

Doctors already warn that other side effects also include inflammation of the liver, sore throat, constipation and diarrhoea, nosebleeds and tingling in the hands and feet.

A total of 2,338 patients who were at risk of high cholesterol or of suffering a heart attack or stroke took part in the study.

Of these 1, 550 were given Alirocumab and a statin, and 788 were given a placebo.

More than a third of the people given Alirocumab saw their bad cholesterol levels fall to less than 0.7mmol per litre of blood within a year.

This is the same level as a baby, Professor Ray said.

'It is the biggest reduction we've had since statins were introduced,' he said. 

In the UK, doctors say bad cholesterol levels should be 3mmol per litre of blood or lower for healthy adults.

People at risk of heart disease or high blood pressure should aim for a cholesterol of 2mmol per litre of blood or lower.

The drug comes as an injection, which patients administer every two weeks.

Professor Ray said they had not discovered any side effects so far, but will keep studying the effects of the drug on larger groups of people.

Currently, he is carrying out a study which will test how much the drug reduces heart attacks and strokes.

The news follows an ongoing debate over controversial guidelines advising statins should be prescribed to millions more people, which has divided the medical and scientific community.

In July this year, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice), the NHS watchdog, issued guidance that statins should in future be prescribed more widely - in fact, to almost half of all adults.

NICE advised 17.5 million adults, including most men aged over 60 and women over 65, are now eligible to take statins, which cost less than 10p a day.

But doctors argue that it is not appropriate to mass-medicalise the public. 

Some believe the side-effects of statins have been massively underestimated. 

This, they claim, is due to an over‑reliance on research funded by the pharmaceutical industry, for whom statins have proved to be the single most profitable class of drug ever manufactured.

They argue that side effects such as depression, cataracts, an increased risk of diabetes and muscle pains could affect anywhere between 10 and 40 per cent of statin users.

Alirocumab all but eliminated bad cholesterol in almost a third of people already taking statins (pictured) to lower their cholesterol. It halved levels in people who weren't already taking statins. Some people can't take statins due to side effects including muscle pain and increased risk of type 2 diabetes
