Fans travelling from London for the match between Manchester United and Chelsea risked not getting to Old Trafford in time following travel chaos on Sunday.

Supporters at London Euston, where trains were heavily delayed or cancelled, were told to travel via Sheffield after a train was damaged in a Watford tunnel at about 7am.

United did not delay kick-off, despite fans struggling to make it in time for the 4pm start.

Lines reopened from London Euston to Manchester Piccadilly but heavy delays were still expected

Virgin Trains confirmed lines had reopened but severe delays were still expected, leaving fans making the journey that takes more than two hours in danger of missing the 4pm kick-off.

Actor and comedian Omid Djalili wrote on Twitter: 'No way to Old Trafford now - 12.37 from Euston cancelled. Too late to drive. Hundreds on the concourse waiting.' 

One supporter added at half-time of the match: 'Chelsea fans just arrived in Manchester due to the delay of the train.'

Those at Euston that opted to travel via Sheffield as advised will not have arrived at Manchester Piccadilly until after 4pm if they failed to make the 11.28am train.

Fans were also prevented from getting on trains due to them being too full on Sunday.

Chelsea fan Bertie Baker-Smith told Sportsmail: 'It's been an absolute nightmare. We were meant to be getting into Manchester four hours before kick-off but now we'll be lucky if we make it.

Fans that failed to make the 11.53am train to Manchester, via Sheffield as advised, will not have arrived in time for the 4pm kick-off.

'Virgin Trains should be offering refunds and paying for our beers all day. I've never had such a poor experience - although the news that Diego Costa could be fit and we could go eight points clear of City is brightening the day.'

A Virgin Trains spokesman said: 'There was damage to a London-Midland train around 7am, resulting in Network Rail carrying out an inspection at a Watford tunnel.

'We've been working hard alongside Network Rail to get the service back up and running, and the line should be reopened by Network Rail very shortly.

'There'll be a knock-on effect with timetables, and we have been advising fans to go via Sheffield, which is the quickest route.'

National Rail added on Chelsea's official website: 'Safety checks of the line are being made between Kings Langley and Watford Junction causing major delays of up to 60 minutes to journeys between Milton Keynes Central and London Euston / Clapham Junction.

'Repair work inside a tunnel has been necessary this morning to allow the safe running of trains.'
