With the launch of Disney's hotly-anticipated Cinderella remake just six weeks away, brands are taking the opportunity to cash in on what is predicted to be one of the year's most successful movies. 

Following the news that Disney's animated movie Frozen is continuing to generate massive profits for the company more than one year after its release - thanks in large part to the ongoing success of its merchandise - brands appear more eager than ever to align themselves with the company's next big project, and already have the first wave of Cinderella-themed merchandise ready for launch.

From reality star-turned-fashion designer Lauren Conrad and make-up brand MAC to department store JC Penney and nail polish brand Morgan Taylor, the market is already being flooded with products inspired by the popular pauper-to-princess movie.

Former Laguna Beach star Ms Conrad, 29, yesterday announced the upcoming launch of a Cinderella-themed collection for her eponymous fashion line LC Lauren Conrad at Kohl's.

Inspired by the ethereal beauty of Cinderella's iconic ball gown and slippers, the collection includes a range of layered tulle skirts, dainty high heeled shoes and sequined sweaters. There's even a sparkly glass slipper-embroidered knit included in the range. 

Due for release on February 22, just under a month before Cinderella is due for release in the US, the products are priced between $60 and $80. 

And hot on Ms Conrad's heels is make-up brand MAC with the upcoming launch of its Cinderella-inspired cosmetics collection.

The range, which is due to be released online on February 26 and in stores on March 3, includes everything from eyeshadow to lip gloss, with each of the products bearing a suitably Cinderella-esque name.

Fans eager to replicate Cinderella's magical make-up look can treat themselves to a variety of Princess-worthy products, including Happily Ever After Lip Glass ($16.50), a Stroke of Midnight Eyeshadow Palette ($44), and Mystery Princess Beauty Powder ($28). 

Even the periwinkle blue packaging has been designed especially to resonate with fans of the film, and is inspired by the color of the iconic ball gown worn by Cinderella when she attends Prince Charming's ball.

Despite the collection not being due for release until later this month, it has already caused quite the stir on social media, with many make-up fans taking to Twitter to share their thoughts on the range.

'Can't wait for the new MAC Cinderella collection, I want everything!' one user wrote, while another added: 'Getting all the Cinderella stuff from MAC when its out OMG [sic].'

And that's just the start of the movie's make-up merchandise. Global nail polish brands Morgan Taylor and Gelish have also announced the launch of their own Cinderella-themed lacquer collections.

The ranges - which are available as normal nail polish, or as professional gel-effect lacquers - each feature the same selection of six shades, all of which have been designed to give the wearer the perfect princess nails.

'We are absolutely honored and ecstatic to collaborate with Disney on this line inspired by the live-action Cinderella movie,' Danny Haile, the CEO and creator of Gelish, said of the collection. 

'For this classic story, we really wanted to create an iconic selection. Drawing inspiration from the movie, we were inspired to develop colors and statement glitters in soft, playful shades for the collection.'

And when it comes to the film's younger fans, there is already a swathe of merchandise available, with Disney launching its own official collection of products online and in stores earlier this week - much to the delight of parents everywhere. 

The 'Cinderella Live Action Film' collection includes costumes, clothing, toys, 'glass' slippers - and even a $200 limited edition ball gown - and is already proving to be a sell out success.

Pricey products: While this $20 ornament has already sold out in Disney's online store, it is currently being sold on eBay for more than double the original price

Dancing shoes: Disney's collection also features a pair of replica glass slippers, modeled on the shoes worn by Cinderella when she waltzes with Prince Charming at the ball

Profitable products: After Disney's Frozen-themed dolls sold out around the world, parents are eagerly buying up similar Cinderella items like these dolls, priced between $35 and $70, in order to avoid disappointment

'Considering this is one of 3500 I would get yours before they are all gone,' one man said of the pricey dress - which is an exact replica of the gown worn by Cinderella star Lily James in the upcoming movie.

But while the dress is currently still available, a trio of collectible pins inspired by the movie sold out on the Disney website within hours of being made available earlier this week.

The limited edition set, which retailed for $69.95 and comes complete with a collectors box, featured three ornately-detailed designs - Cinderella, her iconic glass slipper, and one of the gold butterflies featured on her dress.

Anyone desperate to get their hands on the set can however opt to purchase it on eBay, where sellers are asking for anything up to $300 in return for the limited edition collectibles.  

Similarly, a $20 ornament modeled on the glittering gold carriage which transports Cinderella off to the ball is also no longer available on the the official Disney website, but is already being sold by a enterprising seller on eBay for almost $50 - more than twice the original price.

Must-have items: As part of its new collection, Disney has released new tsum tsums - plush collectibles - modeled after the movie's most popular characters including Cinderella (L) and the Fairy Godmother (R)

Cashing in: JC Penney has also announced the launch of its own official collection of Cinderella products

Star in the making: British actress Lily James plays the role of Cinderella in the upcoming live action adaptation

Disney's newly-released collection of Cinderella-themed 'tsum tsums', collectible plush toys which can be stacked on top of one another, has also proved incredibly popular online. 

Film fans eagerly awaiting the launch shared their excitement on Twitter, with many admitting that they had stayed up until midnight so they could purchase the new tsum tsums as soon as they became available online. 

'Me: laying on my bed ready to refresh the tsum tsum Disney store page at midnight cause Cinderella collection and new collection announcement [sic],' one person wrote, while a second admitted: 'I bought all of the Cinderella tsum tsums and I'm not even sorry.'

And for anyone unable to get their hands on the perfect piece of merchandise from Disney, JC Penney will also be offering a special collection of official products in the hopes of repeating the same success it saw with its sales of Frozen products last year.

'What’s different about Cinderella is that it’s a known story line,' Deb Berman, JC Penney’s senior vice president of marketing, told Dallas News. 

'It’s nostalgic for the grandparents, and everyone will want to see how Disney remakes the 1950 animated film today.'

In March last year, Frozen overtook Toy Story 3 to become the highest-grossing animated film of all time, with receipts of $1.1 billion.

And its merchandise has been equally as successful, with many of the products continuing to sell out in stores around the world, raking in millions of dollars for Disney in the process.
