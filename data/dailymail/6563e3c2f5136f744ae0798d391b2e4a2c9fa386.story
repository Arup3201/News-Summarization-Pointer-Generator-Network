Former mining magnate and racing figure Nathan Tinkler will sell his assets in a bid to pay back debts

Following the repossession of his private jet and the revelation that he owes an Australian billionaire nearly $45 million, the extent of former mining magnate Nathan Tinkler's debt has again been revealed.

Gerry Harvey, executive chairman of Harvey Norman, said the loans he gave to Tinkler began with a one-time sum of $12.2 million and every month or two since then he'd been handing out another few million.

'The debt kept getting bigger every couple of months,' Harvey told The Daily Telegraph. 'Instead of him owing the bank he owed me.'

Harvey, who called it quits on handing money to Tinkler when the total almost tipped $45 million, said the mining magnate used to cash to pay Newcastle Knights players and coaches and bail out his businesses.

Now, the Harvey Norman executive will sell off tens of millions of dollars worth of assets across NSW and QLD as well as more than 560 racehorses previously owned by Tinkler in a bid to retrieve his money.

Harvey now controls all of Tinkler's Patinack horse breeding and racing assets, which will be auctioned at the Magic Millions in September.

Patinack Farm in the Hunter Valley NSW - one of Australia's most renowned racehorse breeding locations - is worth an estimated $20 million.

Also set to be sold at this year's Magic Millions are stallions Murtajill, Monaco Consul, Trusting and Lope De Vega, which have a combined value of around $6 million.

Harvey revealed the reason he loaned so much money to the former mining magnate was because he thought Tinkler had a chance of working his way out of the mess he was in.

He also told of the good Tinkler had done for the racehorse industry, particularly during the Global Financial Crisis.

Spending millions upon millions on horses, a figure Harvey estimated to be upwards of $200 million, was unprecedented in the industry.

For the sale of so many of his assets, Tinkler has apparently enlisted the help of racing expert Richard Freeman.

If all goes to plan, Harvey will be reimbersed with his $45 million and the rest of the profits - which could be in total between $50 and $100 million - will go to Tinkler himself.

Just last week it was revealed that Tinkler had become a father for the fifth time with his former executive assistant, 'pretty blonde' Jodie Van Gilst, Sydney Morning Herald report.

Ms Van Gilst recently gave birth and is reportedly living at Tinkler's Singapore luxury suite in the Marina Collection development.

Tinkler's former spokesman, who says the 38-year-old currently doesn't have a manager, told Daily Mail Australia the new baby was born about two weeks ago.

The spokesman, who no longer represents Tinkler, was unable to provide further details.

Tinkler's estranged wife, Rebecca, has resided in Hawaii with the couple's four children since last year, according to the Sydney Morning Herald.

They are living in their $16 million mansion in the 'exclusively gated community' of Keauhou on the island of Maui.

The Hawaii home was purchased in November 2011, just before the troubled billionaire was forced to announce fire sale of his various assets and undergo the repossession of his private jet and a Falcon 900.

According to Private Sydney, the Tinkler marriage was already on the rocks but it was 'the final straw' when Van Gilst's pregnancy became apparent to Rebecca.

Ms Van Gilst, from Queensland, had enjoyed reoccurring trips to the exclusive Birdcage marquees at the Melbourne Cup.

In 2012, Ms Van Gilst was spotted at the Melbourne Grand Prix with her now baby's father but Tinkler's spokesman shut down the reports, stating they were there 'purely on business.'

Tinkler declared just $9800 in personal taxable income in 2010-11.

He is currently under investigation with ICAC due to allegations in a corrupt scheme to pay illegal donations to Liberal Party candidates.

These claims have been denied by Tinkler.
