No mission is too much for former KGB spy turned strongman leader Vladimir Putin as he sets off on his latest bid to put right the wrongs of nature by teaching birds to fly.

Hang-gliding over Arctic Siberia this week, the all-Russian action man guided white cranes which seem to have lost the instinct to migrate south to a warmer climate for the winter.

The aim was to set the endangered birds on course for Asia and  as with his previous action-man ventures - which included sedating a tiger, tagging a white whale, and offering tender loving care and a tracking collar to a polar bear - the Kremlin announced total success.

As opposition groups and bloggers mercilessly mocked his flying lesson for birds, Putin's PR machine made clear that after a false start all five juvenile cranes had followed the lead bird - the Russian president dressed in flapping white overalls - and flown for the required distance.

It is hoped the cranes will now fly from Kushavet ornithological research station to Tyumen, further south in Siberia, before taking off for middle Asia and a warm winter. 

'For cranes, the parent is a man in a white robe,' explained Yuri Markin, the director of the game reserve.  'They don't remember a particular person. They remember the white robe and hood, or on the ultralight, a white helmet - and a special beak that is worn on the head.'

Pictures do not show Putin wearing the beak, probably to avoid yet more vilification from his foes, on the three motorised hang gliding flights he made on the remote on the Yamal Peninsula in the Arctic.

'It is amazing how the birds get used to it,' Putin told state television  still dressed in his pilot's outfit of helmet and goggles.

'They do not fear the hang-glider and they overtook it. They are amazing. It's a very good feeling.'

He has been preparing for 18 months, he said, and ahead of the crane-flight he clocked up 17 hours flying the hang glider.

Nervous flyer? Putin made three trips in the glider, the first to get familiar with its workings, and two others with the birds

As the cranes - hopefully - head south on their own, jokes were flying round the Russian web today as one former Putin spin doctor branded this a stunt too far. 'Bad publicity,' said Gelb Pavolvsky.

One cartoon showed Putin wearing cardboard wings telling the resentful looking cranes: 'Let's assign roles right now. I'll be the alpha crane!'.

Another had Putin telling the cranes: 'I will save you'. One crane responded: 'Maybe I'd better die out.'

The many faces of Putin: The Russian president is keen to cultivate a hard-man image, but also to present himself as a simple nature-lover

A mock-up picture showed a bare-chested Putin in sun glasses flying on a crane. 

The 59 year old president as  'Mother Hen' and opposition leader Alexei Navalny sneered: "About Stalin they said 'In the night, a light will burn in the window.' And of Putin they will say: 'He flew over our homes with a flock of cranes.'

One Twitter post  said: 'For the flock to recognise him as a leader, he stuffed three feathers in his rear.'

Among his other memorable macho stunts was a scuba dive for fragments of ancient Greek amphorae. Later his spokesman  Dmitry Peskov  admitted the artifacts had been planted on the sea floor for Putin to grab.

Some opponents say humour is the wrong reaction, claiming his stunts are part of the establishment of a cult of personality lionizing an authoritarian leader.

One victim of the crane flight was Masha Gessen, author of a book critical of Putin. She appeared to have been fired from her post as editor of travel and science magazine Vokrug Sveta (Around the World) after refusing to send a reporter 2,200 miles northwest of Moscow to cover the event.

The magazine said  she left by agreement following "differences" with the publishers.  

Like the cranes, Putin also went on to engage with Asia. 

His adventure came en route to  host the Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Vladivostok, attended by US secretary of state Hillary Clinton and leaders of 21 countries.
