Candace Cameron Bure, who stars in the new Christmas film Let It Snow alongside Alan Thick, admits that juggling family life and Hollywood is not as glamorous as people are sometimes led to believe

Fans have been frantically speculating about a reunion since the actress posted photos of herself with some of her former co-stars at the Starlight Awards in L.A. in September. Most recently, she starred in the Christmas film Let It Snow alongside Alan Thicke.

In her new book Balancing It All: My Story of Juggling Priorities and Purpose, Mrs Cameron Bure discusses how she has balanced her acting career with her three children - and never had a nanny or personal assistant. 

'People think I’m this great mom and 
doing it all so perfectly,' the 37-year-old told MailOnline. 'And while I'm appreciative, they’re not 
100per cent truthful. I don’t want people to think I’m this perfect women who
 has it all together, because I don’t.'

She admits that juggling family life and Hollywood is not as glamorous as people are sometimes led to believe, adding that it is 'important that we're all honest with each other.'

Mrs Cameron Bure, 37, is a mother to Natasha age 14, Lev age 12 and Maksim age ten

'No one does it perfect 
100per cent of the time,' she said.

Mrs Cameron Bure, who has been married for 15 years to hockey pro Val Bure and took a self-imposed hiatus from television and film to devote time to her family when her first child was born, admits that her husband's help is imperative to being able to 'balance it all'.

In her first book, Mrs Bure wrote candidly about battling bulimia when she was in her early 20s.

'I chose to be a stay at 
home mom when the kids were little,' she said. 'I stopped working so I could be at home 
with them; and I was fortunate that I
 didn't have to go to work.

'Honestly our lives are even busier as our kids are now 
now pre-teens and teens, but we still manage, between my husband and I, because no matter what our priority is family.'

She added that Mr Bure, who retired from hockey in 2005, is 'incredibly hands on' with their children Natasha age 14, Lev age 12 and Maksim age ten.

'I could not do it myself and balance 
without my husband's help,' she confessed. 'He does so much with the kids. When I'm out of 
town he does everything and vice versa.

'Realistically, if I didn’t have him, I probably would 
have hired a nanny by now!' she said.

While
 Balancing It All is a compilation of Mrs Cameron Bure's best tips and 
tricks for juggling her career, family, and herself, she says there is 
no set formula for 'balancing your life well'.

The actress and author is set to release her second book in January titled Balancing It All: My Story of Juggling Priorities and Purpose

'I've realized that every person's life is 
unique and everyone's circumstances are different. I think that we, as women, need to stop 
comparing ourselves to each other and realize that what may work for 
me, might not work for someone else.

'I hope that when we do our own things well in 
our own life, we’ll have a sigh of relief that we don’t have to look the 
same as some woman on TV -- their balancing will look different from someone else's,' she said, adding that she finds comparison 'dangerous'.

'It leads to disappointment, so I hope people look 
at their own life and do what what they can do the best.' 

The multitasking Make It or Break It star, who was folding laundry and packing for a trip to New York during her interview with MailOnline, said that she simply wanted to share her own story, decisions, and things that helped her along the way.

'We live in a culture where we are so busy, and that pertains to everyone whether you're a working mom, a single mom, or a stay-at-home mom.

'Everyone's plates are just full. So I wanted to be honest with women. And share the things that have worked, and haven't worked in my own balancing act.'
