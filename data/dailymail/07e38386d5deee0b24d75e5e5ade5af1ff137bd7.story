A pensioner is being bombarded with angry telephone calls - after her number was mistakenly printed on a road closure sign.

Construction firm Barratt Homes has erected a number of signs informing residents of road closures as building work starts on their 222-home development in Plymouth, Devon.

But the phone number for Barratt's regional office is just one digit different to that of Laura Bradford - and they printed her number by mistake.

She estimates she has received over 100 calls from angry locals and drivers who have phoned to protest about the development and diversions.

Mrs Bradford, 78, who lives alone in nearby Exeter, said: 'They want to get their facts right. I'm tired of giving people Barratt's number.

'What do I know about road closures or building sites in Plymouth?

'It's tiring actually because some days quite a lot of people call. It drives you mad.

'Luckily there is no one else to hear it because there are swear words sometimes.

'I could do without all this hassle. I've just had a big operation and it's the last thing I need.'

Plymouth City Council controversially gave Barratt Homes the green light to build on former Ministry of Defence land at Hooe Lake in March, despite strong local opposition.

The road is due to be closed for ten weeks from June 11.

Turnchapel and Mount Batten Residents' Association chairman John Wheeler said: 'If closed means closed then I hope there is a contingency plan to ensure emergency services can get in to Turnchapel.

'Having seen the notice I immediately rang the number, which turned out to be a poor lady from Exeter. I also noticed the name Barratt had also been misspelled "Barrett".

'I hope this sort of attention to detail won't manifest itself in the quality of housing.

'People here fiercely opposed this development - and this kind of debacle does nothing but vindicate us and our concerns.'

However, Barratt Exeter managing director Tim Larner said: 'We apologise for any inconvenience the closure of this private road may cause but it is necessary to complete the improvement works.'

The council said it has no jurisdiction over the road because it was privately-owned.
