Scientists have grown a tiny liver in experiments hailed as a huge step forward for desperately ill transplant patients

Scientists have grown a tiny liver – in experiments hailed as a huge step forward for desperately ill transplant patients.

The technique could one day be used to patch up diseased and damaged organs, removing the agonising – and sometimes unsuccessful – wait for a transplant.

The manmade tissue could also be used to test new medicines, preventing disasters such as the ‘Elephant Man’ drug trial, in which six men were left fighting for their lives.

New kidneys, lungs and pancreases could be grown using the same technique.

The research is still at a very early stage but British experts have described it as a ‘huge step forward’ and as holding out ‘real promise’ for an alternative to organ transplants.

More than 7,000 Britons are on the transplant list, including 154 children.

The vast majority are waiting for new kidneys but almost 500 are in need of a liver and around 250 are waiting for healthy lungs to become available.

The Japanese researchers used the three types of cell that generate the liver in a human embryo to grow a tiny piece of tissue in a dish.

It was then grafted on to a mouse’s brain, where it hooked up to the blood supply and grew for at least two months.

The manmade tissue had many of the hallmarks of a working human liver, including the ability to break down drugs.

In experiments, the manmade tissue also extended the life of rodents with fatal liver disease, the journal Nature reports.

The scientists chose the brain because it was easy for them to attach the piece of liver and watch it at work.

However, with human patients, the pieces would actually be used to patch up the liver.

It is hoped the first tests on people can be done in a decade.

Researcher Takanori Takebe, of Yokohama City University, said the first patients are likely to be babies and children with severe liver disease.  But, in time, adults could also benefit.

He added that he believes that his recipe for growing patches of liver is more natural than those being perfected by other scientists and holds ‘enormous therapeutic potential’ for transplant patients.

Dr Dusko Ilic, a stem cell scientist from King’s College London, said: ‘The strategy is very promising and represents a huge step forward.’

Dr Matthew Smalley, of Cardiff 
University, cautioned that the technique won’t be suitable for all 
transplant patients, but added: ‘Nevertheless, the study holds out real 
promise for a viable alternative approach to human organ transplants.’

Professor Chris Mason, an expert in regenerative medicine from University College London, said the manmade pieces of tissue may be most useful when testing new medicines.

If the patches of liver struggle to break down the chemicals, the treatments could be shelved before they do harm.

In 2006, six previously healthy young men were admitted to intensive care after taking part in trials of a new drug at Northwick Park hospital in north London.

One man’s head swelled up so much that his fiancée to likened him to the Elephant Man.

Another spent five months in hospital with heart, liver and kidney failure.  He lost some fingers and all his toes were amputated.

In other cases, drugs have been withdrawn after they have hit the market.

James Neuberger, of NHS Blood and Transplant, which runs the organ donor register, said: ‘The work currently being carried out in the field of regenerative medicine to “engineer” organs for transplant is very exciting. 

‘With further development, it could one day help to tackle the acute shortage of organs available for transplant here in the UK. 

'However, it is likely to be many years before these scientific advances translate into a form of widespread, readily-available treatment for patients. 

‘In the meantime, if we are to reduce the number of people who die every year due to the lack of available organs, we need more people to discuss organ donation with their families and join the NHS organ donor register.’
