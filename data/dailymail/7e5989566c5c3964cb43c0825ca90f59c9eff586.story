While most teenagers are quivering with nerves when it comes to taking their maths A Level, Yasha Asley described it as easy peasy - and he was just seven years-old.

Now the prodigy has gained his third top-grade A level pass at the tender age of ten.

Yasha, whose teacher claims he has 'a brain like a calculator,' achieved an A* in Statistics and now hopes to go to university.

He already has an A* in Maths and an A in Pure Maths - both of which he gained at the age of eight.

He's got the X=Y factor: Yasha, appropriately sitting in front of a picture of Einstein, has achieved another excellent grade (seen here aged eight)

He is the youngest person in the world to have achieved a grade A in Maths - scoring 100 per cent and 99 per cent in two of the six papers two years ago.

Yasha, from Leicester, says he did not suffer from exam nerves as he tackled his Statistics exam paper this year.

He said : 'I opened it, looked at the first question and just started writing.

'I didn't feel nervous. I probably felt better than the other teenagers.'

His father, Moussa Asley, a 49-year-old Iranian, who raised his son single-handedly after his marriage broke up, said : 'It just confirmed my expectation. I felt very pleased and very proud.

'He doesn't work that hard at all. He just does the minimum. He was born with a talent.'

Yasha, who goes to Folville Junior School in Leicester, has tutoring sessions at Leicester University. He is now hoping to find a university that will let him enrol on a Maths course.

He started reading at a very early age and has learnt English, French, Arabic and Farsi.

The boy's headmaster, Bruce Wells, 
said two years ago: 'Yasha is off the scale - just so far ahead of 
everyone else. His thinking skills are incredible.

 'We've linked him to a professor at a local university to tutor him.

While most teenagers fret about their exams, Yasha sailed through his maths paper with ease (picture posed by models)

 'He's not just gifted . He is way more than that. The word genius springs to mind.'

One of his teachers, Adam Spurr, said last year: 'It is like having a second teacher in the classroom. He has got a brain like a calculator.'

His impressive mark came on the same day that thousands failed to make the grade.

More than a quarter of a million university applicants are stuck ‘in limbo’ after a drop in A grades triggered an unprecedented scramble for places.

Record numbers of teenagers missed the grades they needed to secure their first-choice degree courses, causing ‘gridlock’ in the system as universities sifted through borderline candidates.

Decades of ‘grade inflation’ ended as candidates passed 26.6 per cent of exams at grade A – down 0.4 per cent on last year.

It marked the biggest fall in the proportion gaining As since grades were introduced in 1965 to replace a simple pass or fail.

The number of exams awarded the elite A* – used for the first time in 2010 to counter a relentless rise in results – also fell, from 8.2 per cent to 7.9 per cent.
