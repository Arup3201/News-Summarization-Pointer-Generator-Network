Wojciech Szczesny's father jumped to his son's defence and took aim at Arsenal's 'disastrous' rearguard after the keeper was lambasted following their 2-0 New Year's Day loss to Southampton.

A former international goalkeeper with seven caps for Poland, Maciej Szczesny let rip in an interview with Polish sports newspaper Przegladu Sportowego.

Germany centre back Per Mertesacker's agility was compared to that of a rhinoceros by the senior Szczesny, although it's widely recognised that the Gunners keeper was at fault for both goals.

Maciej Szczesny, pictured for Legia Warsaw saving a shot from Blackburn's Alan Shearer in a 1995 Champions League tie, is sticking up for his son after his mistakes led to two Southampton goals 

'He made a mistake for the first (Southampton) goal, coming too far from the goal, but please look at the Arsenal defence - how these guys are playing is a disaster, but for some reason, nobody pays any attention to it. 

'Laurent Koscielny should immediately have run (back) to protect Wojciech, and Per Mertesacker should have stood in the goal,' said Maciej.

'Unfortunately they did not do that and gave him zero support, and in that situation Mertesacker showed the agility of a rhinoceros.

'Wojciech is often paying for it (the mistakes), and that he really cares. He needs someone who will critically analyse every game with him, but also remain positive.

'Someone should support him but the coaching staff at Arsenal are not doing that, meanwhile the entire defence this season is an embarrassment.'

For the opener Szczesny made an ill-advised charge and left his goal unattended, allowing Sadio Mane a chance to convert from a tight angle.

For the second, he toed the ball straight to Serbian midfielder Dusan Tadic in another manic moment.

It's yet to be revealed whether the 24-year-old will start when Arsenal host Stoke at the Emirates Stadium on Sunday after David Ospina played in the FA Cup against Hull. 

Maciej also said he had yet to speak to his son about the dressing-room smoking incident that led to a £20,000 fine but insisted Wojciech 'isn't dumb enough' to do such a thing.

Meanwhile Arsene Wenger, who is growing impatient with Szczesny, is keen to add to his squad in the January transfer window.

St Etienne captain Loic Perrin is one reported target, along with Villarreal defender Gabriel Paulista. Arsenal's Costa Rica forward Joel Campbell could be sent to Spain on loan as a makeweight for the Brazilian, who would require a work permit ahead of any potential move to England.

Elsewhere, negotiations continue with Legia Warsaw over a proposed £2million move for teenage midfielder Krystian Bielik, while forward Yaya Sanogo is expected to go out on loan, with Bordeaux keen to take him back to France.
