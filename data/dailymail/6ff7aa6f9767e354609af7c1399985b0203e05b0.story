Model daughter: Sahar Daftary who died after falling from a high rise building in Salford Quays

For Anisa Daftary, it was the final 
insult to the memory of her beautiful daughter, who died after falling 
150 ft from the balcony of her former lover’s flat in Manchester.

Police officers had arrived at the 
family home in London with two black bin liners, which Anisa thought 
would contain her daughter Sahar’s personal possessions. But when she 
opened the bags, she  discovered a random collection of clothes and 
shoes that were far too big for her petite daughter, a recent winner of 
an international beauty contest.

When Anisa challenged the officers, 
they callously joked that the clothes must be ‘Manchester sizes’ – 
implying that women in the North of England are overweight compared with
their southern counterparts.

In her first interview since Sahar’s 
mysterious death in December 2008, Anisa, a 57-year-old widow from 
Afghanistan but now based in Brentford, West London, reveals how the 
appalling blunder was typical of a police investigation that she says 
betrayed her daughter.

Anisa said: ‘I feel the police have 
failed to carry out a proper investigation into my daughter’s death. 
They have let down Sahar and they have let down our family.’

The body of Sahar, a model who was working at Harrods, was found at the bottom of a Manchester quayside tower block.

Sahar went there to meet Rashid 
Jamil, 36, whom she had secretly married in a Muslim ceremony in 2007, 
the same year she won the global Face Of Asia beauty award. Sahar, 23, 
had separated from Mr Jamil after discovering her ‘husband’ was already 
married to another Muslim woman with whom he had fathered two children.

Betrayal: Anisa Daftary and daughter Mariam Daftary-Karim feel the police inquiry into Sahar's death was deeply flawed

On December 20, 2008, Sahar went to 
Manchester to take part in a fashion show and afterwards visited Mr 
Jamil to retrieve her possessions, which included designer clothes and 
family photo albums.

Sahar’s sister, Mariam Daftary-Karim,
33, said: ‘We don’t believe Sahar would have committed suicide. Two 
people were alone in that flat, but only one person was left alive. We 
want to know the truth of what happened when they were together that 
night.’

Despite repeated requests from the 
family, it was four months after Sahar’s death before Greater Manchester
Police said they could return her belongings.

But the family’s hope quickly turned to despair when they saw the jumbled contents of the bin liners.

And when Anisa challenged the 
officers, she says their response horrified her. ‘They just laughed and 
said the clothes were Manchester sizes,’ she said.

‘I thought I was going to get my 
daughter’s clothes back, but they just joked. I was crying. It was so 
terrible after all that we had suffered.

‘She was the youngest of my five daughters and, ever since my husband died in a motoring accident, I have tried to protect her.’

Double life: Businessman Rashid Jamil with Sahar at their Muslim wedding in 2007

Mariam said: ‘My sister was very 
petite. She was a size 6 to 8 and these dresses were size 14. The shoes 
were several sizes too big as well.

‘They looked as if they had been 
picked up from a charity shop and the police hadn’t bothered to check. 
We didn’t recognise any of the clothes.’The family also claim that police officers didn’t interview them until two weeks after Sahar’s death.

The family solicitor, Richard Slade, describes the delay as ‘extraordinary’.

He says that because the police had 
arrested Mr Jamil over an allegation of murder and he had claimed she 
may have committed suicide, they should have prioritised assessing 
Sahar’s state of mind just before her death.

He added: ‘It’s very disappointing 
that more vigorous measures were not taken in this case. It was the 
family’s impression that the police seemed to have decided it was 
suicide, which tarnished their approach to the rest of the 
investigation. The family found it very difficult to get any information
at all from the police.’

The family have instructed leading QC
James Lewis to challenge Mr Jamil over his version of the circumstances
in which Sahar fell from his luxury flat. Mr Jamil’s solicitor has 
repeatedly insisted that he was not responsible for her death.

The family will also accuse the 
police of treating them heartlessly and of squandering vital time in the
initial stages of the investigation.

And yesterday it was revealed that 
Greater Manchester Police had asked for an 11th-hour adjournment to the 
inquest into Sahar’s death, which had been due to start tomorrow, to 
allow the force to consult lawyers.

Betrayal: Rashid Jamil with Narhisa Amjad, who was also his wife under sharia law

Sahar met Mr Jamil, a businessman, at
a party organised by a fashion magazine in 2006. But because he was 
Pakistani, she kept the relationship secret. Her four older sisters had 
all married Afghan men.

A year passed before Sahar told them 
about her boyfriend. Mariam remembers: ‘She was impressed by him. I 
remember her saying that he was not like some other Asian men.

‘She said, “He’s open-minded and doesn’t want to control me.” I remember being happy for her.’

But when they met Mr Jamil in 
Brentford, the family’s perception of him changed. ‘He drove down in a 
black Range Rover, but was drinking vodka and kept getting us to drink. I
didn’t trust him with my sister.’

Her sister Roha was so suspicious she
asked Mr Jamil direct whether he had been married before. Mariam 
recalls: ‘He said he hadn’t and claimed he only wanted to marry Sahar.’

Mariam said he appeared very anxious 
that their mother wouldn’t approve of him because he didn’t share their 
culture. He jokingly told them: ‘Tell her not to worry because, although
I come from Pakistan, I’m not a terrorist.’

When Anisa finally met Mr Jamil at a 
restaurant in Knightsbridge, Central London, to mark the end of Ramadan,
the month of fasting in the Islamic calendar, she remembers feeling 
‘instinctively uneasy’ about him. ‘He told me he would “not let me 
down”,’ she recalls.

But the couple didn’t wait for  
Anisa’s approval. Mr Jamil and Sahar moved in together in Manchester 
before secretly marrying in a sharia ceremony at a mosque in Southall, 
West London, in 2007.

Tragic: The flats from which Sahar fell to her death

Just a few months later, Anisa was 
contacted by Narhisa Amjad, who claimed to be married to Mr Jamil and 
was expecting their second child.

Mariam said: ‘It was shocking. We told
Sahar that she must come home to London and leave him.’

But Sahar 
didn’t believe the family until she spoke to Narhisa, who had sent two 
photographs of her with Mr Jamil, on the phone at a hotel in Manchester 
where the model was staying with Mr Jamil.

According to the family, 
Mr Jamil told Sahar that he didn’t want to live with Narhisa any more 
and that she had not been a good wife.

‘He must have persuaded her to stay with him because she wouldn’t leave him,’ said Mariam.

It
was only then that Sahar told the family about the secret wedding and 
said she wanted a party for all of the family the following year.

Concerned for Sahar’s happiness, they agreed to an extravagant ceremony 
with 200 guests. Once again, alarm bells started to ring.

Mariam 
remembers Mr Jamil being reluctant for the event to go ahead and he only
invited one friend to the ceremony.

‘He said his father was very 
religious and wouldn’t like him marrying a woman who wasn’t Pakistani,’ 
she said. ‘But we know now that he liked to manipulate women.’

Soon 
after the wedding, the couple started rowing and they broke up when it 
became clear Mr Jamil did not want to move to London and wasn’t prepared
to register their marriage with the civil authorities.

Mariam said: ‘Sahar came back to London to live with our mother. She had got over him and had everything to live for.

‘She
had started studying finance and accounting at university. On the day 
after her death, we were expecting her at home because she was due to 
fly out on holiday to Dubai to celebrate her birthday.’

The Mail on 
Sunday put the detailed claims of Anisa and her daughter  to Greater 
Manchester Police. It refused to comment, instead reissuing a 2010 
statement by Detective Inspector Stephen Keeley relating to the case.

He
said: ‘Following the tragic death of Sahar in December 2008, a thorough
investigation was carried out by Greater Manchester Police. A file was 
prepared for the Crown Prosecution Service, which reviewed the case and 
decided that no charges should be brought against the [then] 33-year-old
man arrested.

‘My thoughts go out to Sahar’s  family at this 
difficult time but I am  satisfied as a result of our investigation that
there are no suspicious circumstances surrounding her death.’

Mr 
Jamil’s solicitor, James Dyson, said yesterday his client had dealt with
these issues during the ‘comprehensive police investigation’.

He added: ‘My client has given a full account to the police and he has always denied being responsible for the death.’
