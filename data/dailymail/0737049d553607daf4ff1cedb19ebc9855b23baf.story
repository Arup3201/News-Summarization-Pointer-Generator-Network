Foster father: Dr. Dennis Sullivan faces a prison sentence of 43 months after he entering a guilty plea for attempted first-degree assault toward his 10-year-old foster child 

On that day, Sullivan reportedly confessed to covering his 10-year-old foster son's mouth with his hand on June 17 after jamming a latex glove in his mouth, Forum News Service reported.

The boy 'was blind, wheelchair-bound and severely mentally disabled,' the media outlet reported.

The Associated Press reported that a criminal complaint said Sullivan's wife claimed to discover Sullivan together with the child, who was having trouble breathing.

The complaint also said Sullivan's wife pressed her husband 'if this had happened before and he said "three more times" in the immediate past and he only "put his hand over (the child’s) mouth for one minute."'

Authorities later apprehended Sullivan at a North Dakota mental health center, The Associated Press reported.

Forum News Serivce said that 'During the investigation, Sullivan admitted to torturing the boy in the genital area a month before the June incident.'

In June, The Park Rapids Enterprise reported 'an amended complaint states the man tied a shoestring around the boy’s scrotum May 17.'
