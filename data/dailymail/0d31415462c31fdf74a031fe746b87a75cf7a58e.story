Daniel Agger has revealed that he is still unsure about his Liverpool future.

The Danish defender is yet to feature for Brendan Rodgers this season after picking up a knee injury on the club's pre-season tour of the US.

Agger was appointed Liverpool's vice-captain last summer, but has since struggled to nail down a first team spot under Rodgers.

He told Jyllands-Posten: 'The future is complicated.

'There are a few things that have to be sorted and we have to take it from there. I actually don’t know what will happen. It is a bit up to Liverpool.

'I have had niggling injuries at the wrong times and I have to say that it is difficult to change the team when it is winning. 

'I am not frustrated by that. I am frustrated the way it happened and the way it was handled.”
