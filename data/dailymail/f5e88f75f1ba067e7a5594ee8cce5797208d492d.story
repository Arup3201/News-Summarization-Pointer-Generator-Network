Americans seem to be stuck in a rut when it comes to lunchtime decisions, preferring cold cut classics like turkey and ham to more adventurous fare, reports Business Insider.

That's according to a Datassential, a menu research firm that surveyed thousands of Americans who had eaten a sandwich in the last week and broke the results down to show the most popular choice.

The overall winner was turkey, which 14 percent of respondents had eaten in the past two weeks, followed by ham at 11 percent. 

Winner: Traditional turkey beat all comers to top the list of most eaten sandwich for Americans, showcased her with radishes and avocado

Other cold cuts fell farther down the list, with roast beef coming in ninth and cured meats like pastrami finishing twelfth.

The most surprising fact of the survey might be that four percent of people like their peanut butter and jelly sandwiches served hot. 

At least they all make the simple sandwich at home.

Deli: Ham also had a decent showing, with 11 percent of Americans who had eaten a sandwich going the ham route

When Americans went out for a bite, the most popular choice was a sub. Were they perhaps visiting the home of the $5 footlong?

Drip: Grilled cheese failed to break the top five sandwiches, melting to eighth place in the ranking behind chicken and BLT

Purchasing a sandwich instead of making one at home also allowed people to experiment with choices that were exotic or regional.

Only one percent of respondents had eaten a french dip beef sandwich, a Philly cheese steak or a torta or other Mexican sandwich, but those who had indulged did so away from home. 

Perhaps the biggest hurdle to more creative bites is know-how. Yahoo! Food reported that the most popular sandwich search was chicken salad, followed by the cucumber sandwich, which doesn't even make Datassential's top 30.
