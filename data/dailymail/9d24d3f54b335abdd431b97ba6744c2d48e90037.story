Hero: Bethan Woolford (pictured) heard Robyn Jeffrey's cries for help and leapt from her car to catch one-year-old Harley as his mother dropped him from the first floor window of the burning home

A young mother made a desperate plea for a passer-by to catch her baby son as she dropped him from the window of her burning home.

Frightened Robyn Jeffrey shouted for help through the top floor window as flames and smoke filled her family's house.

Fortunately, Bethan Woolford, 20, heard 17-year-old Ms Jeffrey's cries and leapt from her car to catch one-year-old Harley as his mother dropped him from the first floor window of the burning home in Harlow, Essex.

Ms Woolford had been driving to work when she saw the drama and ran to help, telling Ms Jeffrey to drop the child into her arms.

She caught the little boy safely as a van driver also stopped and put his ladder against the wall of the house to rescue Ms Jeffrey.

'This girl opened the window and screamed "My baby's in here!," said care worker Ms Woolford.

'I told her to chuck him down. She said she couldn't do it but I swore I'd catch him.

'She held him out the window and let go. I caught him round his waist. It was just instinct, I didn't really think about it.

'Afterwards Harley was just laughing. He thought it was hilarious. I think he wanted another go.'

Ms Jeffrey said: 'I woke up to find thick black smoke everywhere.

'There was no other way to escape except my bedroom window on the middle floor.

'I couldn't see anything because the smoke was so thick.

'I went to the window and I was just screaming "Help me, my baby is in here".

Grateful: Robyn Jeffrey (pictured centre with her son Harvey) and the rest of her family, Stephanie Jeffrey, Raina Jeffrey, Alan Durack and Rebecca Jeffrey

'I shouted "please catch my baby". She said I promise I will and she caught him.'

The house was gutted by fire, but Ms Jeffrey and her family have been able to find a new home following the fire last Thursday.

A joint investigation by the fire brigade and police is underway to determine the cause of the blaze.

The mother-of-one said dropping Harley was 'the most difficult decision of her life' but she knew she had no other option.

She added: 'I just don't know how to say thanks to her. She's such a hero in my eyes.

'I wouldn't have jumped, I just don't think I could have done it. It was the hardest day of my life but I'm so glad my little boy came to no harm.'
