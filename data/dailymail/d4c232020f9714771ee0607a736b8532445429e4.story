Wallowing in the crystal clear water of a luxury hotel pool he could have been any holidaymaker enjoying a welcome respite from the relentless British weather.

However, this was no ordinary tourist, but Shadow Floods Minister Barry Gardiner. And as he slapped on the sunscreen and adjusted his Panama hat, he seemed to have not a care in the world.

He enjoyed romantic walks along the beach with Caroline, his wife of 35 years, and delicious meals at Cancun’s Moon Palace resort, including an all-you-can-eat buffet offering chilled lobster and a beachside seafood diner.

Shadow Floods Minister Barry Gardiner and his wife Caroline spent last week at Cancun's Moon Palace Resort on an all-expenses paid trip to deliver one talk at a conference for chemists

Earlier in the week, he wore an Indian-style shirt to celebrate ‘Bollywood Night’ and donned a tuxedo for a glittering black tie gala dinner.

The Gardiners were guests of Sigma boss and Labour party supporter Bharat Shah, who transformed his family-owned drug distributor into a multi-national company with an annual turnover of £206 million.

They stayed at the Sunrise Hotel in room 1945, a £325-a-night suite complete with a sunken jacuzzi overlooking a lush garden filled with palms and bougainvillea.

The Gardiners were among 460 delegates – mostly from the UK  – at the resort which is described  as ‘the most magnificent in all of Mexico’.

On Friday, as the temperature topped 85F (29C) in the shade, the Gardiners hit the pool. The MP wore a colourful Hawaiian-print shirt with blue floral swimming shorts incongruously paired with brown lace-up leather shoes. A Panama hat completed the look.

Mr and Mrs Gardiner enjoyed days lounging by the various pools at the luxury resort, and long walks on the hotel's six-mile private beach

He and Caroline circled the pool before choosing two orange  sun-loungers nestled under a ‘palapa’ – a sunshade made from dried palm fronds.

Caroline leapt enthusiastically into the pool to join a water aerobics class while her husband smiled and tapped his feet to the music as he gazed appreciatively at the bikini-clad bathers around him.

After reading his Kindle he stripped off his top and waded out into the main pool. He occasionally submerged himself and did a few breast-strokes, but mostly wallowed in the pristine water, closing his eyes at one stage and leaning back to soak up the sun.

A spot of lunch at the beachside fish restaurant was followed by a stroll along the sand with Caroline before they returned to their  sun-loungers for the afternoon.

On Wednesday it was ‘Bollywood Night’ where the Gardiners tucked into a vegetarian buffet while Indian zither music played. A witness said: ‘Everyone was dancing and having a great time.’

On Thursday delegates enjoyed day trips to nearby Mayan ruins.

The Moon Palace resort occupies a six-mile stretch of pristine sandy beach overlooking the Caribbean. There is a Jack Nicklaus-designed golf course, dozens of pools and more than two dozen restaurants.

Each room is equipped with a free minibar offering full-sized bottles of vodka, rum, whisky and tequila.

The Sigma conference is all-inclusive and Gardiner wore a blue plastic wrist-band which also allowed him access to the spa, horseback riding and even the chance to swim with dolphins.

One resort employee said: ‘Everything is included, all the food and booze.

'The tequila has been flowing all night in the bars and we can tell who the English are because they are the ones who sit in the sun all day long and turn pink.’

A gentle ten-minute shower of rain caused consternation among the British.

One said: ‘Ugh, I came here to get away from this.’

Most delegates arrived last Saturday and were given Sunday as a ‘leisure day’ to recover from  jet-lag.

The conference – which was also attended by fellow Labour MP Sir Kevin Barron, former chairman of the Commons Health Select Committee – opened on Monday.

A delegate said few attendees bothered to go to the convention centre, which adjoins the Sunrise Hotel, at all.

He said: ‘This is about having a good time and networking. No one bothers with the lectures. You have to show your face over there at least once but most of the time the lecture hall is empty.

‘Business is done over drinks at the pool or cocktails in the evening. It’s a schmoozefest. We’re all chemists and this conference is something we look forward to every year. One year it was in China, another year at Phuket in Thailand, but Cancun is best of the lot because the weather is so awful back home.’

When asked what Mr Gardiner’s speech was like on Tuesday, the  man replied: ‘I have no idea. I fell asleep. It was very boring.’

Another delegate said: ‘I’ve put on half a stone. There’s nothing to do but eat, sleep and eat some more.’

When The Mail on Sunday approached Mr Gardiner in Cancun on Friday and asked why he was there instead of offering advice on floods in the UK, he said: ‘Very simply, I was asked to give a speech on waste and it’s parliamentary recess.’

Asked if he had considered cancelling the trip because of the crisis back home, he said: ‘I’ve given my reply, thank you.’

Pressed on who was paying for his trip, he replied: ‘You will see that in the [Commons] Register of Members’ Interests.’

Asked to explain his connection to Sigma and the pharmaceutical industry, he replied abruptly: ‘I’ve just told you. I was asked to give a speech on waste. I’ve done that. Thank you very much. I’m on parliamentary recess, OK?’

Mr Gardiner declined to answer further questions.
