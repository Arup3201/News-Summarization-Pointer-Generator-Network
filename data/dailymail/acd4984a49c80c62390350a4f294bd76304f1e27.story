Former top prosecutor Sir Keir Starmer says time should be a barrier to justice

Britain's former top prosecutor has controversially defended police who hold suspects in a ‘legal limbo’ for years while alleged crimes are investigated.

Keir Starmer, the ex- Director of Public Prosecutions, disagreed with those who have called for time limits on how long a person can languish on bail without being charged.

He said time ‘should not be a barrier’ to bringing people to justice for crimes committed decades earlier.

A number of high-profile celebrities, including Rolf Harris and Stuart Hall, have been convicted of sex crimes that happened years ago after their victims finally plucked up the courage to complain about the attacks.

But there have been mounting concerns about cases where suspects are left on bail for long periods – often with strict curbs to their freedom – without charges being pressed.

Veteran disc jockey Paul Gambaccini spent 12 months on bail after being arrested by officers from Operation Yewtree, the inquiry launched after Jimmy Savile was unmasked as a prolific paedophile after his death, only to be told last month (OCT) he would not face sexual assault charges.

The openly gay DJ, who was investigated over historic allegations of molesting two teenage boys, told of his ‘12 months of horror and trauma’ having his name dragged through the mud.

Home Secretary Theresa May has signalled she wants time limits on pre-charge bail amid mounting concern that police forces are misusing their powers by keeping people dangling for months and even years.

In an article in this week’s Radio Times, on sale today TUES, Mr Starmer said the passage of time should not provide immunity against bringing charges against historic offenders.

He said: ‘I do not underestimate the impact that delay has on those arrested and subsequently released without charge, such as Paul Gambaccini. Equally, there is the impact on those tried and acquitted.

‘But they are features of our system whatever the time limits for bringing a case.

‘I certainly wouldn’t want to replicate the situation in countries such as North Korea where virtually all those arrested are charged and virtually all those charged are convicted.

‘That some individuals are released without charge and some are acquitted demonstrates the strength, not the weakness, of our approach.’

Police are allowed 24 hours to keep a suspect for questioning after arrest before seeking a further period of detention from a judge.

In practice, they often quiz a person then release them on pre-charge bail to return for further interview at a later date, giving officers time to build robust cases.

But there are currently no restrictions on the length of time a person can spend on police bail which can force innocent people to put their lives on hold, pay thousands in legal fees and suffer the slow assassination of their character.

Conditions can also be placed on police bail, which can include curfews and restrictions on movement and financial transactions while an investigation continues.

Comedian Jim Davidson lashed out at the system after being arrested under the Operation Yewtree and kept on bail for eight months before being told he would not face any charges.

Freddie Starr, another comedian, spent 19 months on bail after being arrest by officers investigating decades-old sex allegations made by 14 women. The case was dropped.

Some 30 journalists are currently on bail – some for more than a year – while police investigate alleged crimes including phone hacking and paying public officials for stories.

The College of Policing, the professional body that sets police standards, have been asked by ministers to consider introducing time limits for pre-charge bail, which human rights groups believe should be 28 days.

Mr Starmer said it was right to prosecute people for historic crimes – whether it was a ‘an Auschwitz guard standing trial in Germany… or a host of greying celebrities on suspicion of historic sex crimes.’

He said there had been a ‘profound shift’ from the long-held view that not bringing a prosecution within a certain period of time was ‘not fair on defendents’.

There had been a ‘growing understanding that time runs at different speed for victims,’ particularly those who had suffered sexual violence, he said.

‘In a sense they carry an unresolved issue with them, almost an open wound, for many years, maybe even for their entire lives.

‘We are rightly reluctant to say that those now coming forward to report serious allegations, not infrequently against those in the public eye, that they are simply too late.’

Acknowledging that the passage of time caused ‘difficiulties’ for both the prosecution and defence, because of fading memories and lost evidence, he said it was ‘simply not a good enough reason not to bring a case’.

Mr Starmer said: ‘Most importantly, we now understand victims’ interests better and recognise that, for many, achieving closure, the knowledge that someone has been held to account, is an end in itself.

‘We have to be bolder, and clearer, in saying that pure delay should not be a barrier to bringing people to justice. The public does not accept any longer that the passage of time immunises anyone.

‘My own view is that for the most serious offences, and in that I include serious sexual offences, time should never run out.’
