These beautiful photographs capture the frozen stillness of the forests of Lapland in deep winter.

The stunning scenes were captured by Finnish photographer Tiina Tormanen, who works nearby but was nevertheless blown away by the area's ethereal beauty.

Heavy snowfall and drifts completely mask the forests pine trees, making them look almost like glistening, shuffling figures making their way across the snowy wastes.

sub-Arctic forests in a picture taken by amateur photographer Tiina 
Tormanen. Temperatures in the region often plummet to below -20C,

Extreme: Lapland's climate is characterised by snowy winters and temperate summers fed by the Gulf Stream

Shots taken during the day and at dusk show how the pale light of the northern sun barely warms the frigid forests, while nighttime shots show the Aurora Borealis hanging in the dark sky.

Largely situated within the Arctic circle, Lapland's climate is characterised by snowy, cold winters but relatively warm summers due to the Gulf Stream.

Annual temperatures range from a balmy 20C in the summer months, to a deep freeze in the winter that sees the mercury frequently plummet to below -20C.

The Sami people, the historic residents of Lapland, traditionally divide the year into eight seasons instead of four.

Despite the clarity and clever composition of her shots, Ms Tormanen is merely an amateur photographer.

She works at a chef in a hotel close to the forests and captures the stunning scenery in her spare time.

'I work at a hotel and live the whole winter season at the top of fell, so I could easily take photos when the weather looks good.,' the 31-year-old said.

Ms Tormanen looks out across the frozen landscape: 'I like to take photos which I think have feeling, rather than being technically brilliant,' she said

'I keep all my photos as natural as possible, I only use natural light, and don't use a flash at all.

'I like to take photos which I think have feeling, rather than being technically brilliant.

'I think feeling what comes from picture is more important and it touches people's hearts

'Sometimes shots just come in seconds, if I'm lucky and I'm in the right place at the right time.

'I think trees are so beautiful, and important, like all living beings. There is so much magic in nature if you are ready to hear or see it.

'I think it's nice to show people this silent beauty, what is there, and to remind people how amazing this planet is, how much there is beauty in life itself.'
