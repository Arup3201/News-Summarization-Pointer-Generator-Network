Eureka Police Chief Andy Mills say the force has no solid leads and officers were still processing the crime scene on Wednesday night.

Rev. Freed was the only pastor in St Bernard's Church, and had been working in the parish for three years.

Days before his death, Rev. Freed sent his parishioners a message of thanks, wishing them happy holidays.

‘I cannot tell you how proud and honored I am to be your pastor,’ Freed wrote on the parish website.

‘Our parish is alive, joyful and full of faith, hope and charity that define us as Catholic Christians.’

Before arriving in Eureka, Rev. Freed taught at Humboldt University in nearby Arcata for over a decade and spent 'many years' in Japan.

'He was a really, genuinely warm individual," Professor Stephen Cunha, chairman of Humboldt University's religious studies department told CNN.

‘This was not some stuffy clergyman. He was very much someone that you could sit down and speak with.

‘He connected with everybody.’
