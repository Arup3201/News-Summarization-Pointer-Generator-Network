West Bromwich Albion have told Nicolas Anelka he will have to pay for his own lawyer if he wants to fight an FA charge for his quenelle gesture.

The French striker is at the centre of a race storm that could yet end with the termination of his contract at the Hawthorns.

Anelka is facing at least a five-match ban after being charged on Monday — it was not officially announced until Tuesday — for the gesture that is widely considered, particularly in his native France, as anti-Semitic. West Brom responded to that on Tuesday by stating that they would conduct their own ‘internal inquiry’ once the FA’s disciplinary process has been concluded.

Anelka has until 6pm on Thursday to 
respond to the FA and he runs the risk of seeing a suspension extended 
to eight or even 10 matches if he fights the charge.

Given the 
expense involved in bringing in a QC of their own as well as a QC to 
chair the independent three-man commission, the FA would take a dim view
 of such a challenge when they allege it is ‘an aggravated breach’ of 
their rules ‘in that it included a reference to ethnic origin and/or 
race and/or religion or belief’.

After a meeting with West Brom 
technical director Richard Garlick on Tuesday, Anelka was left in no 
doubt of his employers’ position. While the club insisted that Anelka 
remain available to new manager Pepe Mel for now, the 34-year-old was 
told they would not be footing the bill for a top QC if he wants to 
stick to his stance that his quenelle was not racially motivated but 
‘anti-system’.

Sportsmail understands that if he did then fail to 
avoid a lengthy ban, West Brom might even examine the possibility of 
ending his £50,000-a-week contract.

The following are extracts taken from the FA's website explaining the new rules over racial discrimination:

Much to the embarrassment of Everton, Anelka was backed by a player he faced at the  Hawthorns on Monday night.

Romelu
 Lukaku, the Everton striker on loan from Chelsea, gave an interview 
after the match stating he ‘shouldn’t be banned for that’. His comments 
were aired on Everton’s official website, before the video was later 
removed by club officials.

Everton director of communications Alan 
Myers said: ‘It was Romelu’s opinion. It is not the opinion of the club.
 As soon as we saw the comments, we removed them to minimise any offence
 that may have been caused.’

Since making the gesture against West 
Ham on December 28, Anelka has shown no contrition. On the contrary, he 
has argued what he did was not anti-Semitic.

But the FA consulted 
experts before presenting their case on Tuesday and the fact that the 
comedian Anelka was said to be supporting — Dieudonne M’Bala M’Bala — 
has been prosecuted for anti-Semitism and banned from performing in a 
number of major cities in France seriously undermines his argument.

'He was my idol since I was a kid and he still is. He should never have been banned for that. He showed support for a stand-up comedian in France. We don’t need to make such a big deal of it. He’s an adult and I hope he isn’t suspended because he’s a player that people want to see play on the pitch.'

On Tuesday night pressure groups in the UK called for Anelka to face more than a five-match ban.

Jonathan
 Arkush, vice-president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, said: 
‘He has not indicated one bit of remorse. He simply said he wouldn’t do 
it again and that is not good enough.’

Mark Gardner, of the 
Community Security Trust which advises the Jewish community on security 
and anti-Semitism, said: ‘Anelka’s action risks the quenelle being taken
 up by actual anti-Semites and used against British Jews. The FA should 
throw the book at him.’

'Zoopla
 pay £3million to sponsor West Bromwich Albion. That gives them the 
right to spoil the famous striped shirts a little, but not to pick the 
team.'

The club’s shirt sponsor Zoopla said on 
Monday they would not be renewing their deal at the end of the season 
because of the incident. Zoopla.co.uk is a property website and is part of the Zoopla Property Group Ltd, a privately held company whose shareholders include DMG Media, a division of DMGT plc, the company which owns the Daily Mail and MailOnline.

In a statement on Tuesday, West Brom said: ‘Anelka has 
received a 34-page document explaining the allegations. He is now 
considering his options. He remains available for first-team selection 
until the FA’s disciplinary process has reached its conclusion. 
Following this, the club will conclude its own internal inquiry.’

Anelka will be the first player held to account under new guidelines brought in after the Luis Suarez-Patrice Evra affair.

Suarez did receive legal representation provided by Liverpool but West Brom have no desire to be anything like as generous.

Bittersweet: Anelka performed the salute after scoring the first of two goals in a 3-3 draw with West Ham

December 28, 2013

After
 scoring in West Brom’s 3-3 draw at West Ham, striker Nicolas Anelka 
celebrates by making the quenelle — an inverted Nazi salute created by 
his friend, controversial French comedian Dieudonne M’bala M’bala — 
which has anti-Semitic connotations.

The
 gesture is relatively unknown in the UK but there is an angry reaction 
in France with the country’s sports minister calling Anelka’s actions 
‘disgusting’.

Headline: Martin Samuel called for Anelka to be kicked out for the gesture

December 29

Anelka
 says on Twitter: ‘I am neither racist nor anti-Semitic. The meaning of 
quenelle is anti-system. I do not know what religion has to do with this
 story. With regard to the ministers who give their own interpretations 
of my quenelle, they are the ones that create confusion.’

The FA reveal that they are working with an ‘appointed expert’ as part of their investigations into  Anelka’s quenelle. But the delay in making a decision is widely criticised.

West
 Brom’s shirt sponsors Zoopla threaten to end their £3million deal

Just hours before Monday’s
 kick-off against Everton, Zoopla, who have sponsored West Brom since 
2012, announce that they will not renew their deal with the club at the 
end of the season as a result of Anelka’s gesture.

When
 West Brom striker Nicolas Anelka scored the first of his two goals in the 3-3 Premier League draw at West Ham, he celebrated by making a
 gesture largely unfamiliar to fans of English football.

But
 the salute, known in France as 'la quenelle', is the subject of a 
fierce national debate that has reached the French interior ministry and
 stands accused of sparking a spate of attacks across Anelka's homeland.

Here,
 we explore the origins of the controversial gesture and the motives of 
its self-proclaimed inventor, the stand-up comedian and political 
activist Dieudonne M'Bala M'Bala:
