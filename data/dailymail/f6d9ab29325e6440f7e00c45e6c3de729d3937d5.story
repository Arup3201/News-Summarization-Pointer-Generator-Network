Tragic: War hero William Davis, 92, who was believed to have served in the Navy, was found dead at a house in Willenhall, West Midlands

Detectives are hunting a 'heavily blood stained killer' who battered a decorated war hero in his own home, police revealed

A murder inquiry was launched after the discovery of the body of William Davis, who only last week had marked his 92nd birthday.

The frail widower, who served with the Royal Navy in the Second World War, was found dead at his terraced house in Willenhall, West Midlands, on Sunday evening.

Initial post mortem results revealed Mr Davis died as a result of 'multiple head injuries' after being battered with a blunt instrument.

Detective Superintendent Richard Baker, head of major crime at West Midlands Police, said: 'On Sunday, April 1, at approximately 6.30pm paramedics attended the home address of Mr William Davis

'Neighbours became concerned when they couldn't raise William on Sunday evening.

'They managed to get entry into his home address where Mr Davis was discovered deceased within the premises. It was apparent that he had severe head injuries at that time.

'The scene is a heavily blood stained scene. There's an item that was found at the scene next to Mr Davis' body. It has been submitted for forensic examination.

'It's my belief that another item was used in the attack on Mr Davis.

'The type of item used could have been taken from the home address or could have been brought to the address.

'He died from multiple head injuries, some of which we believe were caused by a blunt instrument. It appears that when paramedics first arrived there was a light pulse but he died shortly afterwards.'

Police confirmed there was no sign of a forced break in at Mr Davis' home and nothing was stolen.Det Supt Baker added: 'It appears to be a very violent attack.

'The motive is still unexplained but there doesn't appear to be any sign of forced entry or any sign of a search within the address. There's also no indication of anything being stolen.

'It's highly likely that the person or persons responsible for this may have left the address heavily blood stained.'

Mr Davis, who worked as a locksmith after leaving the Navy and was known as Bill, lost his wife Clara in 2006, three years after they marked their diamond wedding anniversary.

Step by step: Police search Hobley Street, Willenhall, West Midlands, following the suspected murder of William Davis

Officers were called to the scene at around 6.30pm on Sunday evening

The couple had a son and a daughter 
as well as several grandchildren and great-grandchildren, who neighbours
said visited regularly.

Paramedics were called to the house where he had lived alone early on Sunday evening but he was pronounced dead at the scene.

Neighbours spoke of their shock at his death yesterday.

An
employee at the local newsagent’s said Mr Davis had been going there to
buy his paper every day  for 60 years until difficulty walking meant he
couldn’t manage it any more.

‘He
would say hello to everybody in the street, he was a really kind 
bloke,’ he said. ‘You would look at him and think “He’s not 90, he’s 
about 70”.

‘The amount of stories he’s told me and the medals he has shown me – it was unreal.

‘What happened yesterday was a proper shock. It’s absolutely tragic.

‘We
heard that somebody had broken in and stabbed him after he tried to 
challenge them but the police are not telling us anything.’

Pamela Griffin, 72, who lived 
opposite Mr Davis for more than 20 years, said: ‘William was a lovely 
man, very kind and generous and would talk to anyone. He would always 
talk about his time in the Navy. He was very proud of his war medals.

‘I last saw him on Saturday 
afternoon. He was pottering in his front garden and looked happy and 
cheerful.’ Police have refused to say how Mr Davis died or whether there
were any signs of a break-in at his home. They described him as a ‘very
well-regarded, nice elderly gentleman’.

Mr Davis is believed to have served during World War Two and been awarded several medals.
