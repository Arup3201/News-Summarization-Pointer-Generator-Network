A WWE 'diva' has been arrested and charged with shoplifting at a Connecticut Wal-Mart.

Tenille Dashwood, who wrestles under the name Diva Emma, was cuffed at a store in Hartford, Connecticut, on Monday after walking out with a $21 iPad case.

In court, her lawyer said the Australian-born performer, 25, said the case was a misunderstanding.

Attorney Hubert Santos told the Hartford Courant his client simply forgot to pay for the item at the store's self-checkout after buying $30 of other merchandise.

Dashwood was sentenced to one day of community service. The charge will be dismissed when she completes the work, Mr Santos said.

Dashwood, who lives in Winter Park, Florida, was in Hartford for at show on Monday.

WWE - the biggest professional wrestling circuit in the country - is based 75 miles away in Stamford, Connecticut.

WWE issued a statement about the arrest saying, 'WWE is aware that Tenille Dashwood (WWE Diva Emma) was arrested for shoplifting. Ms. Dashwood is ultimately responsible for her personal actions.'

Dashwood, who was born in Melbourne, Australia, wrestled throughout Australia before being discovered by the WWE in 2011.

She is the WWE's first Australian Diva.

Last month, she made a triumphant return tour to her native Australia, appearing on Sunrise, Kids' WB Australia and several radio shows.
