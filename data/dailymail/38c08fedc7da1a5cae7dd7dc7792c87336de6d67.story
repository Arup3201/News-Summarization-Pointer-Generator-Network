A patient died after being forced to wait in an ambulance for four hours because a hospital's A&E department was too busy to admit him.

The 58-year-old man fell ill last Thursday and was taken to Princess of Wales Hospital in Bridgend, South Wales.

However, the emergency unit was 'extremely busy', and the patient had to spend four hours waiting outside, during which time he was assessed by a doctor.

Two hours after finally being admitted to A&E, his condition deteriorated and he died.

Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University health board, which is responsible for the hospital, had previously warned that its A&E services were becoming overstretched due to the high level of admissions.

Hospital bosses urged patients to avoid the emergency unit after 18 operations had to be cancelled thanks to overcrowding.

And last month, it emerged that one patient in Wales had been forced to wait in an ambulance for more than six hours as campaigners warned of a crisis in A&E across Britain.

Police are currently investigating the death of the 58-year-old in Bridgend in preparation for an inquest to be held by the coroner.

In addition, the ABMU health board has launched a review to determine whether the man's death may have been preventable.

The board said in a statement: 'We are deeply saddened to report the death of a patient in the emergency department of the Princess of Wales Hospital on January 16. We wish to express our sincere condolences to the patient's family.

'The patient was admitted to the department at 11am and two hours later became suddenly very unwell. Despite efforts by staff to resuscitate him he later died.

'Prior to being admitted to the department, the patient was in an ambulance, attended by paramedics, for over four hours.

The Princess of Wales hospital emergency department was extremely busy at the time and unfortunately there were delays admitting patients as a result. The patient was assessed by a doctor while in the ambulance.

'The coroner has been informed of his death and the health board is carrying out an urgent review of the case to ascertain what lessons can be learned and if this very sad death could have been avoided.'

South Wales Police confirmed they were aware of the death, and are now preparing a report for the coroner.

The Welsh Government said it expected a 'full investigation' to be carried out, adding: 'We are sorry to hear of this tragic incident and our thoughts are with the family at this very difficult time.'

A spokesman for the Welsh Ambulance Service said: 'We are saddened to hear of this patient's death following their conveyance to hospital last Thursday, January 16, and extend our deepest condolences to the family.

'Handover delays are of great concern to us and we are looking into this matter internally. We will fully support our health board colleagues and the coroner with their investigations.'

Anger: Raymond Osborne, 64, says he had to wait for 20 hours before being given a hospital bed

A retired postman claims he had to wait 
for more than 20 hours for a bed in a hospital after being admitted with
 chest pain and breathing problems.

Bosses
 at Good Hope Hospital in Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands are 
investigating the treatment of Raymond Osborne, 64, who suffers from 
arthritis, asthma and diabetes.

He
 says that after nine hours in A&E he was due to be moved to a bed -
 but instead he spent almost 12 hours waiting outside the ward.

'My treatment was disgusting,' he said. 'I considered lying on the floor to get some rest.

'Elderly
 ladies also waited for four hours or more in the chairs too. One of 
them was even sick in front of me. It was absolutely awful.

'My whole body was swollen due to my arthritis and I could hardly move my right hand.'

Mr
 Osborne, from Erdington, arrived at Good Hope around 1am on January 10,
 after experiencing breathing difficulties and chest pain.

At
 9.30am, he said an A&E consultant told him medics wanted him to go 
to the Observation Ward, so he was taken in a wheelchair and told to sit
 on a row of chairs.

He said he was finally given a bed on the ward at 9.35pm - but was discharged less than an hour later.

'I have been having treatment at the hospital a long time and recently it has gone down the pan,' Mr Osborne said.

A spokesman for Good Hope said: 'We take all feedback very seriously and are very sorry to learn about Mr Osborne's experience.

'This is not what we want for our patients and we are currently investigating the issue Mr Osborne has raised.

'We
 will be contacting Mr Osborne to arrange to meet him to discuss his 
experience so we can ensure that we deliver the highest standards 
possible.'
