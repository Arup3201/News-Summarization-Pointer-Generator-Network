The lines between fantasy and reality are becoming ever more blurred with the army's latest helmet design, which appears to have been inspired by a similar type of headgear used in the Halo video game franchise.

U.S. Army researchers have developed new ways for soldiers’ helmets to provide better protection and comfort and have even introduced head-up displays and night vision goggles.

Four years was spent developing the gear to better integrate protective materials, liners and heads-up display technologies and communications.

Helmet of the future: Revision, a company best known for ballistic eyewear has expanded protection to the head, neck and face in the form of its new modular helmet system

Flexible: Taking a standard Army helmet, and adding a ballistic visor and a mandible that offers 9mm protection, the system is intended for both mounted and dismounted soldiers

Inspiration: It looks as though the idea for the Army's new helemet came from the Halo combat warfare computer game series

A face shield shield has also been introduced because of the high number of facial injuries in recent wars caused by roadside bombs.

‘Because of face injuries from rocks, glass and fragments from improvised explosive devices, there has been a call for increased protection’  said Don Lee, who leads the project at Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center, in Massachusetts.

Lee cited a Joint Trauma Analysis and Prevention of Injury in Combat report that said of all the injuries to the head, 72 percent are to the face.

Natick’s project is called the Helmet Electronics and Display System-Upgradeable Protection, or HEaDS-UP.

Where fiction meets reality: It's easy to see where the Army took their inspiration from when you look at the video game Halo

Top secret: It¿s the culmination of a four-year research project at Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center called Helmet Electronics and Display System-Upgradeable Protection

Plugins: The helmet can attach to a cellphone in order for the soldier to receive up-to-date information on their display

Developed by ballistic eyewear company Revision, the modular HEaDS-UP system is composed of a standard Army helmet with expanded features that protect the head, neck and face.

The add-ons include a see-through ballistic visor and a mandible face mask that protects against 9-mm ammunition and offers better eye, face and hearing protection than existing helmets.

Most notable are the display technologies that can be projected on the inside of the visor.

Though there aren’t any specifics on the projected displays yet, it’s likely there will be images of battlefield maps, targets, health monitors, communications and other Google Glass-type of info.

The concept is a single helmet to replace two helmets soldiers use, the Combat Vehicle Crewman Helmet and the Advanced Combat Helmet.

Upgrade: The helmet aims to provide a more fully integrated headgear system, making use of improved ballistic materials, non-ballistic impact liner materials and designs

Revolution: The Army is testing a new helmet that looks like headwear from the 'Halo' video game franchise. Notable add-ons include a heads-up digital display on the visor

Features: An overall improved design with see-through and projected heads-up display technologies, and better eye, face and hearing protection

Lee said that while this is ‘in no way, shape or form the Army’s next helmet,’ Natick will provide its research to the acquisition office for soldier equipment, PEO Soldier to help it develop future headgear.

‘We’ve come up with tradeoffs, ideas, designs that the soldier will benefit from in the end,’ Lee said.The helmet also comes with add-ons and not every soldier would wear every piece designed for the headgear.

For instance, a soldier who is in a vehicle’s gun turret and therefore vulnerable would be able to add more protection.

Research at Natick focused not only on materiel but biomechanics in an effort to improve the fit, balance and weight of the helmets.

The heads-up display provides soldiers with  live targeting, GPS battle mapping, text communication from mission commanders, live video from surveillance drones and general battle status display.

The helmet is powered by a phone and so is fully upgradable with new apps.
