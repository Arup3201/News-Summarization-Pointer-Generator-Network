Both Krueger, 23, and Warner, 26, were charged Tuesday with special circumstances murder and assault on a child causing death. Each of the counts carry a 25-year-to-life penalty.

The suspects told police they discovered Kayleigh dead late last week and had no idea how she died, the Napa Valley Register reported.

The child's father, Jason Slusher, is incarcerated at San Quentin State Prison. He has been informed of his daughter's death.

Napa police received an anonymous 
phone call around 1 p.m. Saturday requesting a welfare check on a 
three-year-old at an apartment in Wilkins Avenue, Napa.

The couple, who both live at the apartment, 
were arrested Sunday on suspicion of murder in Kayleigh's death after 
someone recognized the wanted couple at a restaurant and tipped off 
authorities.

Sara Krueger, 23, and Scott Warner, 26, became subjects of an intense search in the San Francisco Bay Area after officers conducting a welfare check at Krueger's Napa apartment found the child's body in her bed

Krueger and Warner became subjects of an intense search in the San Francisco Bay Area Saturday afternoon, Lt. Debbie Peecook said. A few hours earlier, around 10 a.m., witnesses had seen Krueger and Warner leaving the apartment with luggage, police said.

Neither suspect owns a car and they were not answering their cell phones.

Someone who spotted the couple at a restaurant near a Bay Area Rapid Transit station on Sunday in the city of El Cerrito alerted police, and BART officers detained them, Peecook said.

BART police Lt. Gil Lopez said they were detained without incident at the station in El Cerrito, about 30 miles south of Napa.

They were questioned and booked on suspicion of murder with special circumstances and assault on a child resulting in death. Peecook said she didn't know whether they have retained an attorney.

Neighbors said that the home had been the scene of multiple disturbances since Kreuger's boyfriend 26-year-old Scott Warner moved in

The property manager at Krueger's apartment building told the Napa Valley Register
 that in recent months, police visited the mother's residence for 
several disturbances, including late-night noise, slamming doors and 
neighbors reporting possible physical abuse of the child.

Warner 'moved in about 10 months ago, and it all went downhill from there,' Elizabeth Chechourka said.

'Management
 sent a letter to them about two and half weeks ago saying, ''The 
authorities know about you, and you need to shape up or you're gonna 
lose your housing,''' she added.

Peecook said Napa officers had made 
several welfare checks at Krueger's home, most recently last week but 
none of the visits resulted in an arrest.

She
 said she didn't know whether Napa County Child Protective Services had 
visited the apartment in response to any neighbors' complaints.

A family friend who often baby-sat the girl was baffled by news of the girl's death and her mother's arrest.

'Never
 saw her raise a hand to the girl. It was like pulling teeth getting her
 to somewhat discipline her,' Kindra Kunkel told reporters.

'This is not Sara; this is not the Sara I know,' said Kunkel. 'She fought so hard for her little girl.'
