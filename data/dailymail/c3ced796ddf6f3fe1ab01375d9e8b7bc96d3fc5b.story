Mario Balotelli shared his distaste at the comments aimed at AC Milan's Sulley Muntari, which were made by Matteo Salvini, secretary of the anti-immigration Lega Nord party.

The Ghanaian international conceded a penalty kick as the Serie A giants failed to beat Hellas Verona at the San Siro on Saturday.

The Italian politician took to Facebook and posted the comments sparking much controversy.

He wrote: 'Immigrants who work well are welcome. So Muntari may return to his home.' 

The Liverpool forward, whose been criticised by Salvini before, couldn't quite believe what the politician had to say about the Milan midfielder.  

In an Instagram post containing a screenshot of Salvini's words, Balotelli wrote: 'This person is serious when he says this or what? He is also a politician? Then voting for me is better.'

Salvini seemed undeterred by Balotelli as he insulted the Italian international with another Facebook post on Sunday.

It read: 'The sense of humour of Balotelli is equal to his education in the field.

'He is angry because I criticised his friend Muntari?

'With all the millions that come to play ball, these gentlemen should accept ironies and criticism from fans, and smile. Take it easy Mario!'
