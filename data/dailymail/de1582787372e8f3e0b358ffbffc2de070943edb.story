Ben Cohen's mother-in-law is due in court after allegedly harassing the former rugby player following his split from her daughter.

Felicity Bassouls, 67, was outspoken in her criticism of Cohen - labelling him a 'disrespectful bully' - after he broke up with Abby late last year amid rumours of an affair with his Strictly Come Dancing partner Kristina Rihanoff.

The athlete and activist, who was part of England's 2003 World Cup winning squad, had been married to Abby for 11 years and the couple have twin daughters.

Rumour: Rihanoff (pictured) and Cohen both vehemently deny that any sort of romantic relationship took place

Mrs Bassouls is due in court this month accused of bombarding Cohen with calls and emails, The Sun reports.

A Northampton Police spokesperson told the paper: 'A 67-year-old woman has been summonsed to appear before Northampton Magistrates court on Wednesday, March 18, to face allegations of harassment.'

It was in September that Mrs Bassouls branded Cohen a 'bully' and called his behaviour 'disrespectful'.

At the time, The Daily Express reported she said: 'I cannot believe what Ben Cohen has written - I am afraid to say, when you are a celebrity and in the limelight, you have to treat people with the same respect that you expect from the public.

'I have experienced a great deal of bullying from you myself. Your behaviour has been so disrespectful and very intimidating not just to myself but my husband also.'

News of the couple's split was linked to rumours between Cohen and his Strictly Come Dancing partner Kristina Rihanoff - fuelled by the pair's on-screen chemistry and steamy routines on the 2013 show.

Both have vehemently denied that any sort of romantic relationship took place.

Cohen met his wife in 1995, at the age of 17, and the couple married in 2003 before having their daughters in 2008. 

The couple's public statement in September read: 'Ben and Abby Cohen have agreed to take time apart to deal with some marital issues but remain fully committed to the welfare of their children.

'There is no third party involved, and Ben and Abby now ask that their privacy and that of their family be respected at this difficult time.'

Their split is the latest in a long list of post-Strictly break-ups.

Susanna Reid split from the father of her three children following her appearance on the hit show, and Rachel Riley - made her split from her husband known in November - when they called time on their relationship, post-dancing appearance.

Cohen's on-screen chemistry with Kristina Rihanoff, sometimes known as ‘The Siberian siren', was widely noted in the 2013 show.

She is extremely fond of the rugby star, calling him ‘the sweetest guy in the world’ soon after they met. 

Rihanoff became romantically involved with Joe Calzaghe after the pair were partnered together in 2009.

The boxer dumped his model girlfriend for Rihanoff and the two entered a relationship, eventually splitting in 2013.
