When Sharon Fox was diagnosed with breast cancer her world fell apart.

Grueling sessions of chemotherapy saw her size rocket from a slender 12-14 to an 18-20 and her body confidence hit an all time low.

However, five years after her diagnosis, the 44-year-old is unrecognisable as she models for a lingerie campaign. 

Who needs Abbey Clancy? For Ultimo's latest underwear campaign Michelle Mone has chosen 15 real women to pose in the latest collection

Sharon from Tamworth, Staffordshire joins 14 other women in Ultimo's latest Real Women campaign.

Michelle Mone, the woman behind the brand, says she wants the campaign to represent real women's bodies and hopes it will boost others' confidence. 

In an interview with Closer magazine, she said 'Body confidence is all about how you feel, not how you look. 

'Since I started Ultimo, it’s always been my aim to boost women’s confidence. I feel it’s our duty to showcase women of all shapes and sizes and make them feel good about themselves.'

For Sharon, the shoot did exactly that.

She said that at the beginning of her treatment back in 2009 she couldn't have ever imagined feeling as comfortable in her own skin as she does today. 

'Chemo was gruelling, I felt so weak and lost my hair. Another horrible side effect was the weight gain - the drugs I was taking made me put on 4st'.

'I felt so self-conscious – so much so that at times I’d refuse to even go out of the house.'

If the hair loss and weight gain weren't enough to knock Sharon's confidence, operations that left her breasts disfigured left her feeling even more self-conscious.

'I had my left breast removed in November 2009, then my other breast removed a year later to prevent the cancer returning. 

'I've since had five operations to reconstruct my breasts. At one point, they were different sizes and that really knocked my confidence.'

Determined not to let her illness ruin her life, in January last year Sharon began exercising reguarly and changed her eating habits. Within nine months had returned to her normal size 14. 

'I’m so proud of what I've achieved. I’m due to have another operation next month to have my nipples reconstructed and I know that’ll make me feel even more confident.'

Sharon now feels confident enough to show off her body again - and the Ultimo campaign gave her the perfect opportunity.

She explains: 'I never thought I’d have the guts to pose in my underwear - but I loved every minute of the shoot! I want to show women who've been through cancer they can survive and still feel feminine.'

Sharon was recently given the all clear and says the biggest relief is that she can be there for her family. 

'I've recently been given the all-clear from cancer, and I’m just happy to be healthy. Being here for my children is the most important thing to me.'

Sharon is one of 15 women who have suffered body confidence issues who are now taking part in the reveal all campaign.  

Office manager Karen Charlton, 46, from Cambridgeshire, felt body-conscious after splitting with her husband in 2010 and was sure she would remain single forever.

'I felt daunted about meeting new men, and was conscious of my wobbly bits.' she told Closer.

Karen began to gain weight after having giving birth to her children gaining two stone because she didn't have time to exercise.

Karen was sick of feeling so self conscious and decided to shape up. 

Tracy, 47, from Tunbridge Wells, (pictured left in the Ultomi shoot, and right, befire she lost weight) had always struggled with her weight but lost 5st to transform her body – and life

'I was unhappy with my flabby stomach and wanted to tone up. I knew exercise would give me the confidence I needed to get out there and meet people, so last year I started using a workout app. 

'Within weeks, I saw results and friends even commented on how flat my stomach was.'

Karen now stars along side Sharon in the Ultimo campaign. She says that she hopes her story will show other women that it is possible to get the figure you want. 

'I’m a normal woman who’s been through a divorce and is raising two kids alone. If I can get in shape and feel good about myself, anyone can! I’m now seeing someone new and my confidence is growing. The Ultimo shoot made me realise just how far I've come.' 

The campaign sees many successful weight loss stories but Tracy Willmers' is perhaps one of the most impressive.

Tracy Willmers, 47, from Tunbridge Wells, had always struggled with her weight but lost 5st to transform her body – and life.

Tracy had struggled with her weight for the majority of her life with her starting to put on weight in her teenage years. 

Michelle Mone (centre) says: 'I've posed in my lingerie and can vouch for the fact it’s not an easy thing to do. But I want women to celebrate their bodies and if others can relate to the pictures and see how great they look, then we've done our job'

My weight problems began at 13, when I’d eat comfort eat to cheer myself up. I carried on eating unhealthily throughout my teens and by 21, I weighed 15st and was a size 18. I could barely walk up the stairs without feeling breathless.'

Tracy began to take a healthier approach when she hit 30 but she said that it was not an easy ride. 

'The turning point came in my 30s when a friend encouraged me to join a gym and I started working out three times a week.

'It was hard – I felt self-conscious and just walking on the treadmill left me gasping.'

Tracy's determination eventually saw her achieve amazing results which encouraged her to continue her healthy habits. 

'I also overhauled my diet and within three months I’d lost a stone. That gave me the confidence to keep going and gradually I slimmed down until I reached a size 12 and 10st – a healthy weight for my 5ft 4 frame.'

Michelle Mone, the woman behind the brand, says she wants the campaign to represent real  bodies and hopes it will boost women's confidence

Since her dramatic weight loss Tracy's attitude to health and fitness has completely changed and she now exercises regularly.  

'I now work out three times a week and have even run a half marathon. My weight loss has left me with stretch marks, but I don’t care – I’m a real woman! 

'I’m nearly 50 and in the best shape of my life. I loved showing off my body at the shoot.'

Michelle Mone added that she hopes that these women's stories will help other women boost their self-confidence. 

'It’s such an incredible feeling that the women get after the shoot, not to mention the confidence it gives them.

'I've posed in my lingerie and can vouch for the fact it’s not an easy thing to do. But I want women to celebrate their bodies and if others can relate to the pictures and see how great they look, then we've done our job.'
