Getting better: The Duchess of Cambridge (pictured last month) will tonight attend the prestigious BBC Sports Personality of the Year Awards

The Duchess of Cambridge will tonight attend the prestigious BBC Sports Personality of the Year Awards - the first sign that she is slowly recovering from the acute sickness that has plagued her first few weeks of pregnancy.

She is only likely to be at the event in London for around 45 minutes but sources have told Mail Online she is keen to pay tribute to the nation's sportsmen and women in what has been an incredible year.

Sources say the Duchess will be going on her own as husband Prince William is back at work as an RAF
 search and rescue pilot on Anglesey.

A St James's Palace spokesman said: 'The Duchess of Cambridge will tonight attend the BBC’s Sports Personality of the Year Awards at the ExCeL London, where Her Royal Highness will present the Lifetime Achievement and the main Sports Personality of the Year Awards.

Along with her husband and brother in law Prince Harry, Kate was a Team GB Ambassador at the Olympics this summer.

The hockey player is known to love sport and was pictured at London 2012, hugging Prince William at the Velodrome in August as Sir Chris Hoy, Philip Hindes and Jason Kenny stormed to success.

Tonight will be the first time the Duchess has been seen in public since she left hospital.

Reports had suggested she could miss 
Christmas at Sandringham and instead choose to spend the festive period 
with her own family in a bid to recover.

Kate's prolonged vomiting could 
continue for much of her pregnancy and she may need to take 
anti-sickness medication for months to come.

She was regularly visited by William and younger siblings Pippa and James Middleton during her stay in hospital.

A royal source told Mail Online: 'While 
the Duchess does not feel ready to attend a four hour engagement, she is
 keen to show her support to the UK's sportsmen and women at this 
prestigious event which caps a momentous year for British sport.'

Earlier this month, Kate looked tired and pale but still
 managed a broad grin as she left hospital following treatment for her 
acute morning sickness and said to wellwishers: ‘I’m feeling much 
better, thank you.’

Grandfather-to-be Prince Charles was equally delighted as he spoke about his son’s happy news.

‘I’m
 thrilled, marvellous. A very nice thought of grandfatherhood at my old 
age, if I may say so. So that’s splendid. And I’m very glad my 
daughter-in-law is getting better, thank goodness,’ he said.

The Duchess has been resting at 
Nottingham Cottage, the London home she shares with Prince William in 
the grounds of Kensington Palace.

Kate,
 30, who is around nine weeks pregnant, has been told by doctors to rest
 and, as a result, had cancelled all her upcoming engagements.

She was taken to hospital earlier this month by her concerned husband after falling ill at her parents’ house in Bucklebury, Berkshire.

Doctors at King Edward VII Hospital in
 London diagnosed her with hyperemesis gravidarum, an acute form of 
morning sickness that causes the patient to vomit uncontrollably and 
become dehydrated.

She was immediately put on a drip to introduce fluids and nutrients into her body and spent three nights in hospital.

Her devoted husband, also 30, who was given compassionate leave from the RAF, was by her side each day.

The couple had not planned to make the pregnancy public until Christmas but felt they had no option due to her sickness.

Meanwhile, Britain's top sports stars were preparing to gather at London's ExCel Centre to celebrate a year of 
sporting achievement hailed as the greatest ever.

Bookmakers revealed a late flurry of bets on Jessica Ennis being crowned BBC Sports Personality of the Year.

Odds on the Olympic heptathlon 
champion taking the award have fallen from 9/1 to 4/1 in the last 48 
hours, betting company William Hill said.

She is now firmly second favourite 
behind cyclist Bradley Wiggins, who is odds-on to win after his historic
 triumph in the Tour de France and gold in the Olympics time trial.

Mo Farah, double gold medallist in the 5,000 metres and 10,000m, is ranked third favourite with the bookies, just ahead of Andy Murray, who became the first British man to win a grand slam singles title for 76 years when he triumphed in the US Open and won an Olympic gold.

Meanwhile, the loving family of Kate’s nurse found dead after being duped by a hoax call today arrived in India for her funeral hours after an emotional mass at Westminster Cathedral.

Mother-of-two Jacintha Saldanha, 46, was found hanging in her nurses' quarters at King Edward VII Hospital in Marylebone, central London, by a colleague and a security guard nine days ago.

Three days earlier the nurse had transferred a call from two Australian DJs, believing they were the Queen and Prince of Wales, to a colleague who described pregnant Kate’s condition in detail.
