A nurse was sacked after she paid a pound into a vending machine only for it to start spitting out free cans of pop.

Melanie Milner was captured on CCTV helping herself to 27 tins while working in Blackpool as a mental health nurse for the Lancashire Care NHS Foundation Trust.

Milner kept 16 of them and gave the rest to her colleagues but her employers reported her to police for theft and she was dismissed for gross misconduct in January last year.

She got her job back after appealing her sacking and was handed a written warning to appear on her file for two years.

Milner, from Ingol, Preston, has now been given a 12-month caution order by the Nursing and Midwifery Council after referring herself to the tribunal.

Panel chair, Lesley White, said: 'Ms Milner has shown deep remorse and shame for her actions and a determination to ensure that they do not recur.

'The panel is of the view that she has demonstrated insight into her actions and how they impact on the profession and her colleagues.

'The panel considers that this caution order is necessary to mark the importance of maintaining public confidence in the profession, and to send to the public and the profession a clear message about the standard of behaviour expected of a registered nurse.'

She had accepted a police caution for the August 2011 theft and was then sacked for gross misconduct. Milner did not attend a London hearing of the NMC but apologised in a letter.

The Nursing and Midwifery Council, which has its headquarters in Portland Place, London, gave Milner a 12-month caution order

She wrote: 'I would like to express my deep regrets and remorse for my actions and apologise for my actions.

'It was disrespectful, wrong and lacked the professionalism that you and my colleagues expect from a qualified nurse.

'While I cannot alter what has transpired, I have taken steps that this will not occur again, and made the right decision by informing the NMC.

'It was an inexcusable lapse in judgment and moral behaviour on my part. While it was an embarrassing experience it is an experience I intend to learn and grow from.'

MPs said her dismissal was excessive and an 'overreaction'.

Mark Hendrick, Labour MP for Preston, said: 'She shouldn't have taken what didn't belong to her and should have made whoever was responsible aware.

'However, the investigation has dragged on and it seems they have over-reacted.'

Ben Wallace, the Conservative MP for Preston North and Wyre said the incident could have been sorted out between Milner and her line manager.

He added: 'I think it is a bit heavy-handed.'

Milner is now free to continue in the profession without restrictions.

A Lancashire Care NHS Foundation Trust spokesman said: 'This is an extremely regrettable situation as the Trust sets very high standards for its staff in terms of their conduct while at work.

'This matter was investigated and dealt with in accordance with trust policies.'
