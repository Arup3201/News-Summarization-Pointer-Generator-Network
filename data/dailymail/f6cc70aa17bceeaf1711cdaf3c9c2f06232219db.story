Ebay was once the go-to site for selling unwanted second-hand goods, but Facebook is gunning for its crown.

Millions of people already buy and sell items using official For Sale groups and the social network is now rolling out tools to make this easier.

The new features are designed to regulate the process so buyers know exactly what is for sale, how much it costs and where it’s available from.

In a blog post, the site wrote: ‘Starting today, Facebook’s For Sale Groups will have improved features for buying and selling.

‘For Sale Group members can now choose the Sell feature when creating a post.

On For Sale groups, payments are made directly to the buyer from the seller and Facebook doesn’t get involved in the process.

‘Any transaction made through a Facebook Group is between you and the seller,’ explained the site.

‘Keep in mind Facebook doesn't own or possess any items a seller lists, so if you have any questions about the things you're buying in a Facebook Group, try contacting the seller.’

Sellers are told to describe the items they’re selling clearly and make sure the goods don’t breach their other Statement of Rights and Responsibilities and Community Standards policies in any way. 

‘You can add a description to what you’re selling, include a price and set a pick-up and delivery location.’

Sellers can also mark posts as Available or Sold and view a catalogue of items they’ve previously sold.

The new features will roll out to all Facebook For Sale Groups ‘in the coming months’ on the desktop version of the site, plus its iOS and Android apps.

Admins for these groups are also encouraged to make sure their group is on the list by filling in an online form.

The tools follow reports in December that Facebook was trialling a ‘Sell something’ button.

On sites such as eBay and Craigslist members have a certain level of anonymity which can make resolving problems more difficult.
