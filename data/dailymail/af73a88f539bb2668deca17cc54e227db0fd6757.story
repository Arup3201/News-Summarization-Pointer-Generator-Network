The owners of an organic farm which was raided by armed police who claimed that they were searching for marijuana but found nothing but crops are demanding an official apology.

Residents at the self-sufficient Garden of Eden farm in Arlington, Texas, were held at gunpoint by a heavy-handed SWAT team for half an hour.

One of the eight adults, who were all handcuffed during the raid, was separated from her children, one of whom is a two week old baby.

Armed raid: Police pictured raiding the Garden of Eden farm in Arlington, Texas, with a warrant to search for marijuana

Justification: Police had a search warrant to search for marijuana as well as a second one to do with a series of code violations

But they claim that the real reason for the dramatic raid was an attempt to enforce authority code breaches that included the grass being too tall and bushes growing too close to the street.

Officers found no marijuana plants at the farm, but code enforcement officers seized 17 blackberry bushes, 15 okra plants, 14 tomatillo plants, native grasses and sunflowers.

In all they confiscated $21,000 of goods, including tyres filled with stagnant waters, a move that residents at the farm say has taken away their self-sufficient lifestyle.

Farm owner Shellie Smith said that police didn't produce a warrant for two hours after the start of the raid and when they did, one warrant was produced to search for marijuana plants and another for a number of code violations.

The farm owners have been locked in a dispute with the city of Arlington since February over the code violations which included a couch and piano in the yard, chopped wood that was not stacked properly and a piece of siding that was missing from the side of the house.

Angry: Farm owner Shellie Smith claims that she and the other residents were targeted by the system because they are trying to teach people to live without the system

Damage: Ms Smith fixes a gate that was broken by police during the raid

But the owners say that the code violates their right to live 'freely and sustainably'.

In a statement released following the raid, Ms Smith said: 'We have been targeted by the system because we are showing people how to live without it.

'We are growing more than just tomatoes here, we are growing the consciousness that will allow people to live freely and sustainably, and the system doesnâ€™t want that to be known.'

The only person to be arrested during the raid was resident Quinn Eaker - who was taken to jail for an outstanding traffic violation.

Innocent: Police found no cannabis plants on the site, but a number of other crops were confiscated and taken away

Seizing goods: Code enforcement officers confiscated $21,000 worth of goods from the farm

He told television station WFAA8: 'I think every single right we have was violated, every single one.'

The police say that they handled the raid with 'dignity, professionalism and respect'.

A City of Arlington spokesman meanwhile told the television station that the purpose of the raid was to 'improve the quality of life, to resolve life safety issues within neighbourhoods and to hold the property owner responsible for creating blight conditions on their property'.

The raid on the Garden of Eden is the latest in a series of incidents where armed police have been drafted in to deal with relatively small scale offences.

Recent years have seen an Atlanta gay bar raided by SWAT teams after allegations that customers and staff were having public sex and to perform license inspections at Orlando, Florida, barbershops.
