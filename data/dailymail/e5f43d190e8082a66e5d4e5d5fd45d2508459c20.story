A female care worker who was caught stealing from a disabled pensioner in her own home has avoided jail time.

Nadia
 Summers, 24, grossly abused her position of trust after she was paid to
 look after seriously ill Lynette Nardone, 64, a court heard.

Ms
 Summers was taped on CCTV taking money from Mrs Nardone's purse, before
 stuffing it in her underwear while caring for her at her Wolverhampton 
home.

Stashing the cash: The 24-year-old, in full view of a secret camera, stuffed the notes inside her bra thinking whe would not be caught

Mrs
 Nardone - who suffers from Multi System Atrophy (MSA) a debilitating 
neuro-degenerative disease - became convinced the carer was stealing 
from her so installed a £1,000 CCTV system at her home.

Her
 suspicious were confirmed after shocking footage caught evil Summers 
rifling through her employers bag to steal £20 from her purse last 
November. 

Summers,
 from Wolverhampton, was then captured on camera stealing £20 notes from
 her vulnerable patient a further two times over the space of five 
weeks.

Convicted: Summers admitted taking £60 from her victim's bag over the course of a week

The family contacted
 police, handed over the tapes and earlier this month Summers was hauled
 before a court where she admitted theft.

Cannock Magistrates Court gave Ms Summers a suspended sentence after hearing how she was filmed at the 
property in Perton, near Wolverhampton, three times between November 5 
and December 12 last year - stealing a total of £60.

Prosecutor Giles Rowden told the court: 'She was employed as a carer for a vulnerable person whose abilities are limited.

'On November 4 the victim came out of hospital. She realised the following day that money was missing from her purse.

'It became a fairly frequent occurrence and her family set up CCTV cameras which captured the defendant removing money from her purse and putting it into her bra.

'She accepted she was responsible on three occasions of stealing £20.'

In a written statement read out in court Mrs Nardone, who suffers from Multi System Atrophy (MSA), said she had 'lost what little trust and faith I had left'.

She said: 'Nadia's actions have cost me so much more than just £60 from my purse or £1,000 for cameras.

'She has taken away what little trust and faith I had left. It has been hard for me to accept that I need help, and allowing strangers into my home as carers has been yet another challenge.

'I felt helpless to accuse the people who care for me, fearing a 'my word against theirs' situation.

'I was frightened to upset them in case they took it out on me. I depend on people.

'I hope Nadia can never again cause any other vulnerable person the distress and heartache that she has caused me.

'Nobody deserves to feel like a victim in their own home at a time when what they need and deserve the most is support and care and dignity.'

MSA is a degenerative disorder, similar to Parkinsons disease, the average lifespan for a sufferer after diagnosis is eight years.

Speaking after the hearing Lynette's furious daughter Kate Lowbridge blasted the 'intolerable' stress her mother was put under.

The 40-year-old said: 'The whole situation has been a complete nightmare. I know it is only £60 but the stress it has caused my mother has been intolerable.

'Nobody should have to go through this and have to set up CCTV cameras so that they are protected in their own home.'

On Thursday, Cannock Magistrates Court handed Ms Summers a 12-week prison sentence, suspended for 12 months.

Ms Summers was also ordered to do 180 hours community work, pay £1,060 compensation £85 costs and an £80 victim surcharge.
