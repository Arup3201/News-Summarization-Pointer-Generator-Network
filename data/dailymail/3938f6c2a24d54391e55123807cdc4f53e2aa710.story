Ronald Smith, 59, from South Bents, near Whitburn, South Tyneside, died after breathing in fumes from an airbag during a car crash in January 2011, an inquest heard

A husband involved in a minor car crash died months later after breathing in the ‘noxious’ contents of an airbag.

Ronald Smith’s wife June was relieved when he arrived home apparently uninjured following the six-car shunt, an inquest heard.

However he told her the airbag had been torn open by a shard of glass as it inflated and he had inhaled the gases it contained along with a large amount of white powder.

Grandfather Mr Smith, a 59-year-old marine engineer who had been extremely fit and active, began to suffer chest and breathing problems.

After several weeks he went to hospital where he was placed on a ventilator.

However, three weeks later Mr Smith died of bronchial pneumonia.

South Tyneside coroner Terence Carney recorded a verdict of misadventure on  Mr Smith, from Marsden, South Shields. He said: ‘This man died as a result of this incident (the car crash) and more pointedly because of the explosion of his airbag ... and exposure to noxious substances.’

Outside court Mr Smith’s son, Lee, 36, said: ‘It’s the verdict I was looking for. Ever since it happened we wanted an investigation to  see if anybody was to blame and I’m happy with what the coroner has said.’

It is believed to be the first time a driver has died after inhaling the contents of an airbag, and Mr Smith’s widow spoke her shock and devastation that something designed to save life had actually taken it.

‘I knew from the very beginning that it was the airbag,’ she said. The accident that led to Mr  Smith’s death happened in November 2010 as he was returning home through Hartlepool.

The AA says when airbags ignite they produce nitrogen, which inflates the airbag and should not be hazardous (file picture)

He drove into the car in front at the same time that another went into the back of his Vauxhall Insignia. His head was flung forward by the impact and he inhaled the contents of the torn airbag, the inquest at South Shields was told.

The AA said the motoring organisation had no record of similar deaths.

A spokesman said: 'In the event of a crash, sensors in a car, behind the bumper for example, measure the rate of deceleration.

'If the impact is severe enough, an explosive device triggers the inflation of the airbag. In some systems a sodium azide tablet is fitted inside, and this is ignited electronically.

'When it ignites it produces nitrogen, which inflates the airbag. Nitrogen already makes up 78 per cent of the air we breathe so it’s not hazardous.

'As soon as the bag has fully inflated it starts to deflate - once it’s taken the force.

'A lot of powder is also released. This is mainly talcum powder, which manufacturers use as a lubricant to help the airbag slide into the correct position during assembly.

'Some systems use canisters of a cellulose-based gas to inflate the airbag, but this isn’t regarded as toxic either. We have checked our records and cannot find any similar cases, but this death is very sad.'

‘He told me about the white powder straight away,’ said Mrs Smith. ‘He said there was so much of it he couldn’t see.

‘I just thought that the white powder had got into his lungs. I thought his body would get rid of it by itself – I didn’t think it would be permanent.

‘Not long after that I noticed that he wasn’t right, he would become breathless walking up the drive.

‘Ronnie has never smoked so that was very worrying. He started to cough a lot as well. It wasn’t normal because he wasn’t like that, he never got colds.

‘He had always been so healthy and was extremely fit. I knew  from the beginning that it was the air bag but other people would  look at me as if to say, “Don’t  be silly”.’

On January 5 the couple went to South Tyneside District Hospital and Mr Smith was immediately given oxygen and admitted.

‘He could barely move,’ added his widow. ‘It was a very cold winter, and he was really struggling. We used to walk everywhere and he was always out every night with the dog, but he got so bad that he couldn’t even walk a few steps without my help.’

Forensic pathologist Dr Stuart Hamilton told the inquest that Mr Smith’s lungs were both extremely ‘heavy and firm’.

The AA said it had no record of similar deaths. A spokesman for Vauxhall said the company planned to investigate the matter but did not wish to comment at this stage.
