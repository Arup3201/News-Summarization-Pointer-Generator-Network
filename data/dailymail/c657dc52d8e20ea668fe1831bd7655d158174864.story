Complaint: Murderer Dale Cregan is demanding to move prisons so he can be closer to his family

Police killer Dale Cregan has gone on 
hunger strike – complaining that he is too far from home and does not 
like being segregated from other inmates.

Cregan, who killed policewomen Nicola 
Hughes, 23, and Fiona Bone, 32, in a gun and grenade attack, has started
the protest at maximum-security HMP Full Sutton, near York – 80 miles 
from his Manchester home.

Sources said that the one-eyed 
30-year-old – also jailed  in June for the murders of David Short, 46, 
and son Mark, 23 – wants a move to Strangeways and the ability to mix 
with other inmates.

Cregan, 30, is said to have started his hunger strike in protest at being kept in segregation for his own safety.

Jonathan Reynolds, MP for Stalybridge and Hyde, hit out against the killer and said he was obsessed with getting the attention of the public.

'Dale Cregan deserves to spend the rest of his life in prison and how he is held is a matter for the prison authorities,' he said.

'He is clearly proud of the reputation he has gained and this is now one of the few ways he has of getting the attention that he craves.

'Hopefully he will be dealt with accordingly and can get right back to serving his sentence in whichever way the authorities see fit.'

Cregan wants to move to Strangeways so he can be closer to his family in Droylsden, Greater Manchester.

He is currently believed to be in segregation at Full Sutton - 80 miles from Manchester - to shield him from ongoing safety threats, with reports suggesting there is an underworld reward of £20,000 for anyone who damages his remaining eye.

Current home: Cregan is one of several well-known killers being held in HMP Full Sutton, near York

Move: Cregan is keen to be transferred to HMP Strangeways in Manchester where his family lives

A Prison Service spokesman refused to comment on Cregan's status or condition, but said: 'We take food refusal extremely seriously.

'If a prisoner chooses to refuse food for any reason, the Prison Service works with healthcare staff to monitor their physical and mental health.

'Prisoners who are considered mentally capable are entitled to refuse health interventions, provided they fully understand the consequences of their decision.'

Fellow inmates at Full Sutton include Dennis Nilsen, who murdered 15 young men and kept their remains in his flat, and Jeremy Bamber, convicted of killing five members of his own family.

Victims: PCs Nicola Hughes, left, and Fiona Bone, right, were killed in a gun and grenade attack last September

Cregan lured police officers Nicola Hughes, 23, and Fiona Bone, 32, to their deaths in a gun and grenade attack on September 18 last year.

He had gone on the run days before killing David Short last August after gunning down his son, Mark in Droylsden three months earlier.

The manhunt reached a ghastly conclusion when Cregan ambushed the constables following a bogus 999 call to a house in Hattersley.

He was given a whole life sentence at Preston Crown Court in June.
