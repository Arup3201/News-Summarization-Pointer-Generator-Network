He's a hero!: Charlotte Bomb Squad Sgt. Robert Whitley was awarded the medal of Valor Tuesday for removing a bomb from a man's neck without wearing any protective gear

A North Carolina police officer was awarded the Medal of Valor after surgically removing and defusing a bomb implanted into a man’s neck – without wearing protective gear.

Charlotte Bomb Squad Sgt. Robert Whitley received the award Tuesday for heroically racing to a hospital Sept 15 to remove the improvised explosive device while putting himself at great risk.

X-rays and CAT scans showed the object lodged in the man’s neck was a large, unexploded bomb – the man was trying to commit suicide, WSOC reported.

The unconscious man lie on a table in the hospital while staff evacuated for their own safety.

Doctors afraid to operate called the police, calling Mr Whitely into action.

'It looked to be a rifle bullet, homemade, sealed with marble, one of which was impaled in right side of his neck,' a doctor told ABC News.

‘I've never seen anything like this,’ he told the station

The bomb squad veteran soon carefully set about his task of removing the bomb without setting it off without any protective gear.

‘It was stuck, so working it out I didn't want to do more damage than had already been done,’ he added.

Roughly 15 minutes and several skipped heartbeats later, the device was out and people began returning to the hospital.

Officials have not publicly identified the disturbed man, but have said he will not face charges for trying to take his life, WSOC reported.

The fearless officer told the station he joined the squad because ‘you get stories like this to tell.’
