Donald Trump took to the witness stand in court today after being accused of wooing investors into buying condos with the promise of profit-sharing, then reneging on the promise after the sale.

The property developer who found fame for firing incompetent contestants on The Apprentice found himself in the line of fire, as the plaintiff's attorney sought to demonstrate to the jury that Trump and his companies had engaged in a 'bait-and-switch'.

The civil trial is centered around Trump's namesake 92-storey skyscraper, two blocks from Chicago's Magnificent Mile in Michigan Avenue.

Shelly Kulwin, the lawyer for Jacqueline Goldberg, sought to establish that Trump was a hands-on manager, while Trump said he was a big-picture executive.

'The primary thing is to build a great building,' Trump told jurors, leaning into a microphone and speaking calmly and steadily. 'You can't fool people.''That's an interesting infomercial,' Mr Kulwin responded. He later told the judge that Trump was not answering his questions, adding: 'He's giving a speech.'Trump's testimony is said by both sides to be key to the trial's outcome. He could remain on the stand for days, talking about the development of the luxury Trump International Hotel & Tower.

The trial stems from a lawsuit filed by Ms Goldberg, 87, who in 2006 agreed to buy two condos for about $1 million each at the skyscraper.

The building, which has more than 300 hotel rooms and nearly 500 condominiums, is in a prime location along the Chicago River.

The lawsuit that alleges breach of 
contract and deceptive practices seeks the return of a $500,000 deposit 
Ms Goldberg made for the properties and other unspecified damages.

Her lawyer portrayed the sale of the 
condos as a bait-and-switch, where Trump and his executives sought to 
make the properties more attractive investments by telling prospective 
buyers they would reap a percentage of profits from banquet hall 
rentals, food sales, laundry, parking and other services.

Trump's stardom and real estate successes were also touted in condo sales pitches.In his opening statement, Mr Kulwin said: ' "Who better to go into the hotel business with than Donald Trump?" she thought.'.

One reason Trump summarily cancelled the
profit-sharing plan, Mr Kulwin said, was because he had failed to 
entice a corporate tenant to rent several floors of the building, 
cutting into the tower's potential profit.

The profit he had promised to make condos a more attractive investment he now needed for himself, Mr Kulwin said.

When
Ms Goldberg completed her purchase in 2006, Mr Kulwin alleged, Trump 
and other executives knew the profit-sharing offer would be withdrawn.

It was only formally withdrawn in 2009, however, a few months before the tower's grand opening, he added.

'They made a deal and then they said, "Surprise! No deal",' Mr Kulwin said.

Stephen Novack, Trump's attorney, said that Ms Goldberg was a sophisticated, longtime investor who signed documents explicitly giving Trump executives the power to revoke the profit-sharing offer if they saw fit.

In an apparent bid to deflect any blame from Trump, Mr Novack sought to counter the portrayal of Trump as a hands-on executive, in his opening statement.

'Donald Trump delegates most decisions,'
Mr Novack said, noting that he had 2,500 employees. 'It would be 
impossible for him to be in the details of each project.'

He insisted the decision to change the profit-sharing provision was someone else's and it was one that Trump agreed to only later.

After an hour of testimony The Chicago Tribune said Trump left the city's Dirksen U.S.Courthouse, giving a thumbs up to reporters and saying: 'I love Chicago.'

He is due to return to the stand Wednesday morning.
