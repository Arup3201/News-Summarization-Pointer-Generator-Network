The NSA hacked into former Mexican President Felipe Calderon's email account for years, a new report claimed on Sunday.

The shocking news came after German newspaper Der Spiegel published a detailed report analyzing a document leaked by Edward Snowden. It alleges that the US National Security Agency (NSA) has a division called 'Tailored Access Operations' (TAO), meant for difficult missions.

It claims that the TAO published a report in 2010 saying it 'successfully exploited a key mail server in the Mexican Presidencia domain within the Mexican Presidential network to gain first-ever access to President Felipe Calderon's public email account.'

The NSA allegedly hacked into the public email account of former Mexican President Felipe Calderon, seen in this 2012 file photo, while he was in office. The operation was reportedly known as 'Flatliquid' by the NSA

The NSA's reportedly said the email domain was also used by cabinet members, providing 'insight into Mexico's political system and internal stability.'

The operation was known as 'Flatliquid,' Der Spiegel adds, and is believed to be the source of increased tension between the US and Mexico.

The files' existence was initially revealed by journalist Glenn Greenwald in September, The Daily Dot notes. Greenwald told a Brazilian TV channel that he had a Powerpoint presentation given to him by Snowden, showing how the NSA intercepted emails and text messages.

Pena Nieto, Calderon's successor, was spied on by the NSA even before his July 2012 election, The Daily Dot adds. The NSA allegedly looked into his emails. In the wake of this revelation, Nieto reportedly summoned the American ambassador, seeking an investigation.

Der Spiegel's goes on to say cell phone communications between Nieto and nine of his associates were analyzed. Using a database called 'DishFire,' contact information for select individuals was singled out and spied on.

An alleged 85,489 text messages were intercepted by the NSA using this technology.

Mexico is not the only Latin American country to be spied on by the NSA. 'The communication methods and associated selectors of Brazilian President Dilma Rouseff and her key advisers' were also spied on, the paper adds.

In the wake of the allegations, Rouseff cancelled a trip to Washington earlier this fall. Der Spiegel claims that Rouseff believes Washington's espionage is based on economic reasons.

Other leaked documents allegedly reveal that the US spied on communications at oil company Petrobas, which the Brazilian government has a stake in, the paper adds.
