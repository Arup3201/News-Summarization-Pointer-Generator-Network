Children shrieked in disgust as removal men tore the tail off a whale carcass in a botched attempt to take it from the beach where it had washed up.

It took 20 helpers and two industrial diggers to haul the 20-tonne southern right whale on to a flatbed truck, before being driven to a landfill site.

The clean-up job was captured by British photographer Dan Beecham, 30, at Sunset Beach outside Cape Town, South Africa, against a backdrop of the city's distinctive Table Mountain.

A whale carcass lies beached near Cape Town, South Africa: It is thought that the 20-tonne southern right whale washed ashore after being hit by a boat

Dead: The whale's tongue lolls out as water laps against its lifeless body and a digger approaches to begin the process of carrying it away

Huge: The massive marine mammal weighed 20 tonnes and was 10 metres long

A lonely figure: Cape Town's Table mountain can be seen rising majestically on the horizon behind the whale carcass

Unusual sight: Curious passers-by gathered to gawp at the dead beast and take photographs of their own

Behemoth: A girl stands by the carcass, her small frame showing in comparison the massive size of the massive animal

Frolicking: Children run near to the whale carcass, before removal men accidentally ripped off its tail and turned everyone's stomachs

Close up view: Photographer Dan Beecham didn't describe the smell of the dead whale, but it's probably safe to assume that it wasn't very pleasant

Scavengers: Sea gulls circle overhead, perhaps hoping to get a beak-full of putrefying whale blubber for breakfast

He said: 'When I arrived a small crowd had gathered around the beached male. A few minutes after I arrived, representatives from the City of Cape Town authorities arrived and set up a cordon.

'The authorities got to work right away to get the whale off the beach.

'But one botched attempt involved trying to drag the poor beast from its tail but it ended in the lifting strop tearing through the tail, pulling it clean off with a disturbing guttural sound, followed by screams of horror from all the on-looking children.'

After three hours the 10m-long whale was eventually lifted on to the flatbed and driven away to be disposed of.

Here come the fuzz: A member of the local 'Law Enforcement' spies the dead whale lying forlornly on the practically empty beach

Heavy duty equipment: A building site digger approaches the whale carcass as clean up crews prepare to push it towards the nearby road to be taken away

Get ready to push: The digger closes in on the massive corpse

Reinforcements: It eventually takes two diggers to roll the dead creature up the beach to where it can be taken away

Oops: Workmen from the clean-up crewget ready to haul the whale carcass onto a flatbed truck, it appears that this photo was taken shortly after they ripped off its tail

To me... to you: The dead creature is winched on to the flatbed as a digger pushes from behind

Ready to go: The whale is finally loaded on to the truck and ready to be taken a way

Rest in peace... All loaded up on to its makeshift hearse, the whale is ready to be transported to its final resting place - the local landfill site

Mr Beecham, from Abingdon, Oxfordshire, believes fishermen or an accident may have killed the animal.

He added: 'Someone who saw it when it first washed up said it had a lot of line on it, perhaps from nets, so it could have been an entanglement or a combination of entanglement and a ship strike.'

According to folklore, the explanation for the right whale's name is that they were the 'right' ones to hunt, because they float when killed and often swim within sight of the shore.
