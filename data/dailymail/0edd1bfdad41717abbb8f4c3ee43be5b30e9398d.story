It is the time of year when most of us are dreaming of getting away from the cold weather and the hum drum of being back in the office.

For conscientious pet owners though the thought of a beloved furry companion suffering in a cold concrete kennel while they live the high life is reason enough not to book that trip.

A new hotel could be the answer: The House of Mutt is an upmarket retreat designed exclusively for pet dogs aiming to offer them a relaxing holiday while their owners are away.

The House of Mutt is a lavish retreat for pooches that provides a plush alternative to kennels and encourages dogs to unwind, relax, and enjoy themselves.

The upmarket accommodation offers many activities for dogs that are not too dissimilar from those their owners may seek in a holiday.

These include long country walks, swimming, curling up by the fire, and even having their portrait painted.

Guests at the grand house can also enjoy playing ball games in the paddock, sleeping in handmade beds, grooming and training sessions, and having a bespoke collar made.

The five star service, which starts at
 £39.50 per night, begins from the moment the dog arrives, in a personal
 taxi driven by staff at the House of Mutt in Fakenham Magna, Suffolk.

The
 hotel run by Sarah Mountford, 45, sleeps a maximum of 10 dogs at a time
 to ensure that each resident gets the care, attention and pampering 
they deserve.

The seven bedroom property is a former rectory that doubles as the family home for Sarah, her husband David, a vet, and their three children.

Sarah is struggling to keep up with demand for the luxury accommodation and has even been asked if owners can stay, too.

She said: ‘I have always looked after dogs for friends and have always had my own dogs here.

‘But the idea for the House of Mutt started after a friend told me their dog always seemed so happy after a stay at our house, and we realised it could be a business.

‘I had wanted to set up a business I could run from home and we had room to accommodate dogs so it seemed ideal.

‘The thinking behind it was to create a fabulous place for dogs to be, it's an ideal set up because we have a lot of space and countryside where dogs can completely relax.

‘My husband and I feel as though we can offer a sociable, comfortable, family environment for dogs to stay when their owners are away.

‘There are a variety of services we 
offer including watercolour and acrylic portraits of the dogs, bespoke 
collars, training and grooming, and medical checks.

‘Dogs
 like to be spoilt as much as their owners and sometimes they feel 
pressure to behave or perform but here there are no expectations to be 
anything other than dogs.

‘People say when their dogs leave the House of Mutt they seem very happy and relaxed, it's like a home away from home.’
