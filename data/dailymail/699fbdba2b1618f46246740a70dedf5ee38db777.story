Householders could be banned from buying a deadly pesticide that caused serious pollution on a renowned fishing river.

Scientists investigating the incident believe that someone may have poured only two teaspoons of the poison down a kitchen sink but it was enough to wipe out all the bug life along a ten-mile stretch of the Kennet.

It killed all the freshwater shrimp, caddis fly and mayfly, leaving trout and other fish with nothing to feed on and in turn hitting predators up the food chain such as otters, kingfishers and herons.

The pesticide entered the Kennet at Marlborough in Wiltshire via a sewage pumping station and affected the river as far downstream as Hungerford in Berkshire.

At the height of the alert last month, people were warned not to let river water between the two towns come into contact with their skin, to stop children splashing in it and not to eat the trout caught in it. Now Environment Minister Richard Benyon has ordered his staff at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs to investigate how the pesticide, chlorpyrifos, can be banned from general domestic use.

Mr Benyon, who owns a country estate flanking the Kennet further downstream near Reading, said he was alarmed to find ‘how easy’ it was to buy the pesticide online.

‘I have asked Defra to find out why this chemical is so readily available and to suggest what restrictions we should be imposing,’ he said.

‘I’m firmly on the side of those who want to make sure this never happens again. Something as toxic as this should only be available to people with the qualifications to use it safely.

‘I’ve asked Defra’s chemical regulations directorate to provide me with advice and I will act upon it. We want to make sure in the medium to the long term that we are protecting rivers like this from pollution incidents, whether they come from agricultural use or personal use. Somebody could have just been cleaning out their garden, trying to clean algae out of their fishpond. We don’t know.

‘Whether we get to prosecutions or not, I don’t know. The important thing is that we look at every aspect of this, making sure that the availability of this chemical is investigated.’

The Kennet, which flows down to Reading where it joins the Thames, is renowned in angling circles for the purity of its water and the fatness of its trout, and there are syndicates along the river near Hungerford where anglers pay up to £3,000 a season for their sport.

Chlorpyrifos is regularly used on lawns and golf courses and to tackle insects on crops and some soft fruits.

It was banned in Singapore in 2009 for use in termite control in soil and the US phased out chlorpyrifos for use in buildings and on construction sites from 2001 due to public health and environmental concerns.
