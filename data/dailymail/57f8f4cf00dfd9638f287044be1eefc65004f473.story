2012 White House runner-up Mitt Romney is tanned, rested and ready and will win the presidency in 2016,a Utah congressman claimed on Monday.

Rep. Jason Chaffetz and former Massachusetts Gov. Romney are both Utah Republicans and Mormons – Chaffetz is a Jew who converted in college – but he insisted on MSNBC's 'Hardball' program that his pick is guided by substance, not home-team rooting.

'I think he actually is gonna run for president,' he said during a segment he shared with Maryland Democratic Rep. Elijah Cummings, a fellow House Oversight Committee member.

'He probably doesn’t want me to say that.'

Utah Republican Rep. Jason Chaffetz insisted that fellow Mormon Mitt Romney will be elected president in 2016

Tanned, rested and ready? Romney says he's not running for president but the Utah Republican Party wants the RNC to let it draft him at the 2016 national convention in Cleveland, Ohio

'A hundred times he says he's not [running],' Chaffetz conceded, 'but Mitt Romney has always accomplished what he's set out to do.'

'I think he’s proven right on a lot of stuff. I happen to be in the camp that thinks he’s actually going to run, and I think he will be the next President of the United States.'

Chaffetz told the Salt Lake Tribune on Tuesday that 'there are more reasons [for Romney] to do it than not.'

'I haven’t yet consulted my Magic 8 Ball, but I bet it would come to the same conclusion.'

A Quinnipiac University poll released last week found that 45 per cent of Americans believe the country would be better off if Romney had won the presidency in 2012. Thirty-eight per cent say a President Romney would have made the country worse off.

That same poll placed President Barack Obama at the top of a list of the 'worst presidents' since World War II.

Utah Republican Party Chairman James Evans told the Deseret News on Tuesday that he wants the Republican National Committee to change its rules to leave the door open to drafting Romney into the presidential race even if he's not a declared candidate.

'It's never been done before,' Evans said. 'We're not going to stop until we have Gov. Romney as the Republican nominee.'

Romney has been openly critical of the president in recent months, especially concerning the growing crisis in Iraq.

'His foreign policy is what has led to these crises all over the world and trying to recapture the lead, and keeping these kinds of things from happening is going to be a real challenge,' he told Fox News on June 12.

'I don’t know how we can go on with a country not having the kind of leadership that it needs. … This is the result of the president’s missteps over the past several years.'

Stumping for Republican U.S. Senate candidate Scott Brown in New Hampshire last week, Romney insisted that he won't run for president a third time. He was also a candidate in 2008, losing the GOP nomination to Arizona Sen. John McCain.

The Associated Press reported that the Brown campaign held its rally at the same New Hampshire location where Romney launched his 2012 White House bid.

Chaffetz was on the MSNBC program 'Hardball' along with Democrat Elijah Cummings, who serves with him on the House Oversight Committee

Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee (2nd R), accompanied New Hampshire senate candidate Scott Brown (R) during a campaign stop at a farm in Stratham, N.H. on July 2

Former New
 Hampshire Republican Gov. John Sununu boomed to a cheering crowd at the
 event that 'we had an election in 2012 in which clearly the wrong 
person won.'

Brown
 said later that 'New Hampshire knows Mitt Romney very, very well, and 
not just because he won the presidential primary here.'

After Romney spoke, he was 'mobbed,' the AP reported, by fans including some wearing t-shirts from his 2012 campaign.

But he again rejected the idea of a Romney 2016 run.

'I'm going to get behind the one who I think has the best chance of winning,' he said, adding later that 'we'll get someone who can win.'

'The field of the republican candidates that I’m seeing are much better equipped' to run, Romney told NBC News last month at a GOP fundraising retreat in Colorado.

'I brought a number of the 2016 contenders here,' he said. 'If I had been running, I wouldn't be doing that.'
