Marc Kirvin leaves Manchester Magistrates Court where he pleaded guilty to stealing the handbag of a woman knocked down and decapitated by a lorry

A sick sneak thief dubbed 'The Vulture' was jailed today for stealing a hit and run victim's handbag with £1,600 cash inside - as she lay decapitated in the road.

Marc Kirvin, 46, picked up the bag from the ground and and made off with it just four minutes after 62-year-old Sawari Ashraf stepped into the path of a 40 tonne lorry.

He later split the cash with a pal. Kirvin was arrested after police investigating the tragedy publicised CCTV pictures taken from a bus of him grabbing the black bag with gold clasp and also the dead woman's shoes.

Officers acting on a tip off went to house to find a haul of cash on his mantlepiece.

Kirvin told police he had been looking for work when they saw the bag and had taken the money because of 'greed' and added that he had planned to use the cash to take his wife on holiday. He said he had no idea Mrs Ashraf was lying dead in the road.

Today Kirvin looked shocked as he was jailed for four months after he admitted theft at Manchester magistrates court.

District judge Wendy Lloyd said: 'It is clear that when you ran into the road you had no idea that the bag and shoes belonged to the woman, however you knew the bag belonged to someone and its theft was bound to cause misery to someone

'The fact is the bag and content would have been of sentimental value to the family of the deceased, since there were personal items inside.'

Mrs Ashraf, a grandmother, died instantly when she was in collision with the articulated lorry as it was being driven through the rush hour.

The ensuing impact at 9.54am on March 29 in Longsight, Manchester, propelled her handbag and shoes up to 130m from the rest of her body.

The grisly nature of the incident led to ghoulish onlookers taking sick pictures of the gruesome scene and posting them on Twitter.

But as police were called to the crash
scene, Kirvin, of Altrincham, who was travelling as a passenger in a 
flat-back truck got out of the vehicle when he noticed the bag.

Miss Jennifer Baines, prosecuting 
said: 'Due to the impact, Mrs Ashraf's body was propelled 130 metres 
down the road. Four minutes later we see Mr Kirvin diving in front of 
the bus in order to pick up the handbag and shoes.

'The co-accused were unaware that her 
body was 100m away from her belongings and around 130m away from the 
initial point of collision.'

She said a significant aggravating 
feature was that because he took the handbag, which had several 
identification cards inside, it meant there was a delay in identifying 
her body.

This left her family waiting an agonising 12 hours to find out if their mother and grandmother had been taken from them.

She added: 'She was of Islam faith and
it is extremely important that the body is buried within 24 hours. She 
said it was only when crime stoppers received intelligence that police 
were led to Kirvin's door step.

'He wasn't at home and when his wife 
called him, it was at that point he tells her what he had done. In 
interview he said he had seen a bag which looked like it had been driven
over many times. He identified the driver of the flat pack truck 
Terence Gatter, 66.

The CCTV shows that as they stopped at
the junction Mr Kirvin exited and proceeded to pick up the bag and 
shoes, which had been in the middle of the junction. By this time the 
victim had died from her injuries.

A purse, disability badge, national insurance number, mobile phone, house keys and around £1,600 cash was inside the handbag.

In a statement, Mrs Ashraf's family, 
said the theft of the bag created a prolonged anguish and suffering to 
them and they even had to change their loved-one's house locks.

She read out a family statement saying: 'Our family cannot express the stress, anxiety, heart-ache and sadness this has caused.'

In a statement, Kirvin's wife Alison 
said he felt guilty taking the money and was going to spend the money on
their children at Christmas - but she said she had eventually persuaded
him to hand it in to the police, which he had planned to do.

Kirvin told police he had been looking
for work when they saw the bag and had taken the money 'because of 
greed' and he had planned to take his wife away on holiday, but knew she
would be suspicious.

Gatter said they were driving along 
and saw this bag in the road and simply deduced that a person had left 
it on the roof of their car and drove off.

Gatter initially denied splitting the 
cash - even thought it was later found he had used it to pay for £400 
council tax and £118 car tax. He told police: 'I'm not like that, 
neither is Marc. There's nothing in my house, I would not know about any
money.

In mitigation, defence lawyer Kerry 
Bell said her client had suffered health difficulties in the past, 
including a stroke and being diagnosed with epilepsy, which led to attempt suicide several times.

Miss Bell said her client was 
co-operative with police and had handed over the money in his 
possession. She urged the judge to look at it as simply a handbag theft.

She added: 'He has seen a handbag on 
the street and he has taken it. There was no knowledge of the accident, 
he hadn't seen anything. There are no police officers in attendance.

'It was an opportunist offence, there 
was no targeting. There has been a return of the money. It was 
completely out of character for this man. Obviously he feels remorse and
has felt remorse from the outset.'

'Mr Kirvin cannot express in words how
much sorry and guilt he feels to the family of the lady. This is a man 
that hasn't been in trouble for a long period of time. He has shown 
remorse from the outset and fully co-operative from the outset.

Sentencing of Gatter was adjourned until July 10.

After the crash police arrested a 
lorry driver, aged 40, on suspicion of causing death by careless driving
but he was freed on bail pending further inquiries.
