Having to find a suitable place in which to land and refuel your F-16 fighter jet can take a lot of time.

But this video released by Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage, Alaska shows the ingenious way to top up the tank without losing any air miles.

Captured on camera is the moment the F-16 skilfully flies up behind a tanker aircraft and steadies itself in the skies over snowy Alaska.

A large nozzle extends from the back of the tanker plane and then manoeuvres towards the fighter jet.

The jet moves into position, allowing the nozzle to enter a small triangular hole at the top of the F-16.

The two planes maintain their speed as the snowy Alaskan landscape flashes by below them, and the fuel transfers from one to the other.

Receiving enough fuel to carry on its flight, the fighter jet pulls away from the larger plane and flies off.

The process is then repeated with another plane moments later.

Eielson Air Force Base and Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson are the home of RED FLAG-Alaska, who execute tactical air combat employment exercises.

The exercises are designed to help pilots gain more experience by having them deal with the stresses war fighters go through while flying, but in controlled conditions.

The crews are subjected to a number of conceivable combat threats, and up to 70 jet fighters can be operating in the same airspace at one time.

On average, however, more than 1,000 US Air Force members and up to 60 aircraft deploy to Eielson, and an additional 500 people and 40 aircraft deploy to Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson for each event.

The exercises also provide an operations training environment for participants such as unit-level intelligence experts, maintenance crews, and command and control elements.

Refuelling in the air is an example of a tactical exercise pilots are required to demonstrate.
