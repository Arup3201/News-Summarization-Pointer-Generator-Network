Mitt and Ann Romney paid deliberately paid more taxes than they needed on their $13.6 million income last year, it has been revealed.

The presidential hopeful’s campaign released their tax records for 2011, showing he paid a total of $1.9million in taxes, giving him a rate of 14.1 per cent. They also donated just over $4 million to charity, double the amount of the Obamas.

It was also revealed that the Romneys deliberately limited deductions for charitable giving, meaning that they voluntarily paid more tax than legally required.

Democrats instantly leapt on the 
disclosure, arguing that it was at odds with what the former 
Massachusetts governor said in July.

In a July 29 interview with ABC News,  Romney said: 'I don't pay more (taxes) than are legally due and 
frankly if I had paid more than are legally due I don't think I'd be 
qualified to become president.’

In total, the Romneys earned $13,696,951 in income, mostly from investments, which are taxed at a lower rate.

According to the release by Romney trustee Bradford Malt, the Romneys' charitable donation of $4,020,772 to charity last year ‘significantly reduced their tax obligation for the year'.

Romney's campaign said the candidate had paid an effective tax rate last year of 14.1 percent, and owed an average effective federal tax rate of 20.2 percent over the 20-year period ending 2009.

Most of the Romneys' $13.7million income from 2011 came from investments. Their $4million donation to charity accounted for nearly 30 per cent of their gross income.

The former Massachusetts governor and former head of Bain Capital has been under significant pressure to release his tax returns, especially from the Obama campaign.

According to Malt, the Romney’s will release a notarised letter from Pricewaterhouse Coopers as proof that both Mitt and Ann Romney paid their state and federal income taxes for the past 20 years.

Mitt Romney’s campaign today released a statement from his physician proclaiming that he is a ‘vigorous man’ who has ‘reserves of strength, energy, and stamina’ that allow him to handle ‘unexpected demands.’

Dr Randall D. Gaz of Massachusetts General wrote that Romney, 65, takes a baby aspirin and cholesterol medicine Lipitor, adding that the GOP hopeful doesn't smoke or drink, or have any serious illnesses.

The campaign also released a health summary for his running mate, Paul Ryan, which declares his health excellent.

Ryan's doctor says he exercises vigorously, doesn't smoke, and uses alcohol infrequently. Ryan has said he enjoys the taxing P90X workout regimen. 

Talking Points Memo notes that Romney artificially inflated his tax rate so that he could remain in his self-proclaimed 13 per cent tax bracket by way of deferring $1.75million in charitable donations.

The couple’s 2010 tax return had already been released.

Campaign officials said the couple filed the return Friday with the Internal Revenue Service, after receiving an extension.

Romney released his 2010 tax returns and a 2011 estimate in January, but he has declined to disclose his returns from earlier years.

His vast fortune and his long association with Bain Capital, the private equity firm he cofounded, have been much discussed this year.

His campaign earlier estimated that Romney would pay about $3.2million in taxes for the year, an estimate well above the $1.9million actually paid. He paid about $3million in federal income taxes in 2010 – an effective rate of 13.9 per cent.

Critics, including Obama, have urged Romney to release more than just the two years of returns and follow his father's model. When George Romney ran for president, he released 12 years of tax returns.

The Romney campaign did put out a summary Friday by Malt, the trustee of the couple's blind trust, saying that over the 20-year 1990-2009 period, the Romneys owed both state and federal income taxes and paid federal taxes at an effective annual rate of 20.2 per cent.

Romney told reporters in August that he's never paid less than 13 per cent of his income in taxes during the past decade. He said that Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid's claim to have heard that he paid no taxes in some years was 'totally false.'

The former Massachusetts governor, who would be among the richest presidents ever elected, is aggressively competing with Obama for the support of middle class voters. Romney has estimated wealth of as much as $250million.

Vice president Joe Biden gave only 1.5per cent of his income to charity. In tax returns released by the White House, Joe and Jill Biden earned a combined $379,035 in 2011, and paid $105,362 in taxes, only giving $5,540 to charity.  And according to the Washington Times, Romney gave twice as much of his adjusted gross income to charity as President Barack Obama did.

Obama's own tax return for last year showed that he and Mrs Obama paid $162,074 in federal taxes on $789,674 in adjusted gross income, an effective tax rate of 20.5 per cent.  The president gave less than 7per cent to charitable organisations in 2011.

Their income plunged from $1.7million in 2010, with declining sales of the president's books.

His tax rate of 14.1 per cent is below 
that of many Americans because most of it flows from capital gains, 
which are taxed at 15 per cent whereas the top marginal income tax rate 
now is 35 per cent.

On average, middle-income families, those making from $50,000 to $75,000 a year, pay 12.8 per cent of their income in federal taxes, according to Congress' Joint Committee on Taxation.

Several tax law experts said Friday that Romney's newly released tax returns would not be much help in uncovering the most persistent mysteries of the candidate's sprawling finances - whether he used aggressive tax-deferral strategies, what are the specifics and tax advantages of his numerous offshore investments, what is the source of his massive retirement account and what are the details behind his now-closed $3million Swiss bank account.

The analysts said those details could emerge only if Romney provided far more of his tax returns - including files dating back to his years at Bain Capital, the private firm he left in 2001.

Romney, who initially refused to disclose any tax returns, has drawn the line at providing only his 2010 and 2011 returns.

It has been a trying week for the presidential hopeful, as Romney has been doing damage control for the leaked fundraising video in which he notoriously said that 47 per cent of the nation ‘believe that they are victims' and don't pay federal income tax.
