James Bond may like his Martini shaken, not stirred, but the fictional spy hasn't had  to contend with zero gravity when sipping his favourite tipple.

Making cocktails in space is a difficult business, but now there’s a specially designed ‘glass’ in the pipeline that promises to force liquid to stay put.

Grooves in the 3D printed vessel will let astronauts enjoy the aroma of a beverage and keep the fluid in place so they can drink in a way they are used to on Earth.

A Californian company has designed a martini glass (pictured alongside a cup) intended for zero gravity that has ridges to ensure liquid stays inside it and can be sipped by an astronaut

A company called Cosmic Lifestyle Corp (CLC) in Oakland, California came up with the design - which is a work in progress - to solve the problem of drinking in space.

Nasa once developed ‘parabolic sherry’ and astronauts have been known to have a swig of vodka, but drinking from a conventional glass is difficult.

This is because liquid becomes sticky and clumps together in blobs in zero gravity. 

If a glob of water is broken, for example, it splits into many smaller blobs that scatter everywhere and are hard to clean up.

To solve this problem, liquid is typically kept in bags with attachment for straws, but while this is practical, it’s not an elegant solution and means astronauts can’t smell the liquid, which is naturally less pungent and tasteless in zero gravity.

The start-up chose to 3D print the cup so the complicated design can be refined quickly – with each design taking around 15 hours to print. Because there is already a printer on the ISS, the idea is that glasses could be printed off straight away, without the need to transport the delicate vessels.

In the 1979 film, Moonraker, James Bond, played by Roger Moore (a poster is shown), has a space adventure but doesn't attempt to drink his signature martini in space

The first step is drop the glass inside a 102ft-tall lift at Portland State University, to produce two seconds of weightlessness, so that the durability of the glass and how different fluids react, can be tested.

Experts will use a high speed camera to look at what is happening and refine the design.

Researchers will then conduct live tests with humans on a parabolic aircraft or ‘vomit comet’. One unofficial test has already taken place.

The ultimate goal is to 3D print a ‘glass’ on the ISS.

‘The Zero Gravity Cocktail Project is a fluid dynamics and lifestyle experience design experiment,’ the company said.

‘We are creating an open air drinking container that allows you to enjoy the aroma of the drink, yet keep the fluids under control.

‘Your mouth completes the connection like a straw and you can suck the drink into your mouth.’

The ‘glass,’ which is said to ‘combine the beauty of a classic martini glass with the physics of space science’ has grooves that force liquid to flow towards the drinker’s mouth, in one direction.

Because there is already a printer on the International Space Station (ISS), the idea is that glasses could be printed off straight away, without the need to transport the delicate vessels.

‘The Zero Gravity Cocktail Project is a fluid dynamics and lifestyle experience design experiment,’ the company said. It hopes that products including the glass could be used by astronauts as well as future space tourists and colonists in the future

Researchers at the Maseeh College of Engineering and Computer Science at Portland State University recently unveiled a zero gravity espresso cup, which has a series of channels to simulate pouring.

'Its geometry is the 'smart' part, which provides the fluids-control system without requiring pumps or centrifugal forces,' said Drew Wollman, who developed the system.

'The shape of the container can passively drive fluids to desired locations without moving parts—exploiting the passive forces of wetting and surface tension.'

The new design makes possible the enjoyment of espresso and other drinks in the low-gravity environments of spacecraft.

Without the pull of gravity, fluids behave very differently than on Earth. 

Instead of 'pouring,' a liquid retains a more globular shape held together by its own surface tension.

This phenomenon complicates even the most basic of maneuvers such as drinking a cup of coffee.

Drinks have typically bee consumed in plastic pouches in space. This image shows a pouch of coffee attached to the ISS' new espresso machine

The 3D-printed espresso cup is designed to cheat low-gravity by channeling liquid along a specifically-calculated contour in the vessel to exploit capillary forces that simulate the action of pouring.

Experiments related to the development of the zero-gravity cups have been officially dubbed the Capillary Beverage Experiment by Nasa.

Related tests to be performed onboard ISS this year include simple drinks such as clear juices, to complex drinks such as cocoa and peach mango smoothies.

Last year one Italian astronaut took an ISSpresso machine with her to perk up the crew.

It’s one of several projects planned by the group who envisage its lifestyle products could be used by astronauts as well as future space tourists and colonists.

‘We are hoping to inspire the idea of a future when space hotels are in orbit and settlements are on other planets that people can relax and enjoy the experience of a quality drink, no matter what the gravity,’ the company said.

It has created a Kickstarter campaign to continue developing the cup and raise $30,000 (£20,000) to eventually print it on the ISS.

‘This campaign will help us test the glass in real weightless environments, which is very difficult to simulate on Earth,’ CLC said.

There have been many attempts to create cups capable of drinking liquids normally in space. Here, astronaut Greg Olsen uses a hose to blast droplets of water into his mouth

The 'glass' can be pre-ordered from the crowd funding website for $400 (£263) and $500 (£329) for a colourful version, and is due to ship in February next year. 

Earlier this year, researchers revealed a 3D printed design that will let astronauts sip coffee from a strangely-shaped cup.

It too uses a series of channels to simulate the pouring needed to create the perfect drink.

While a martini glass may be useful, arguably champagne and carbonated drinks remain the final frontier in space drinks because bubbles aren't buoyant in zero gravity conditions as they are on Earth and so behave in a strange way. 

They remain randomly distributed throughout a fluid – even after someone has swallowed them and small bubbles can join up to make large ones, resulting in digestion problems.
