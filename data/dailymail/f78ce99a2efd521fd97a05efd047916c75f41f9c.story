Team news

Sunderland

Sunderland head coach Gus Poyet will make late decisions on a trio of key players ahead of Saturday's Barclays Premier League clash with Swansea.

Defender Wes Brown and striker Steven Fletcher both missed Tuesday night's Capital One Cup defeat to Stoke with calf problems, while midfielder Emanuele Giaccherini sat out with an ankle injury, and all three are being assessed.

But Poyet has indicated he will make changes with full-back Billy Jones and winger Will Buckley confirmed as starters with the Black Cats still looking for a first league win of the campaign.

Provisional squad: Mannone, Pantilimon, Jones, Van Aanholt, Brown, O'Shea, Vergini, Coates, Roberge, Cattermole, Bridcutt, Rodwell, Gomez, Larsson, Johnson, Buckley, Giaccherini, Alvarez, Mavrias, Wickham, Altidore, Fletcher, Graham.

Swansea

Wilfried Bony will return for Swansea's Barclays Premier League trip to Sunderland on Saturday after serving a one-match ban.

Bony was sent off in the 1-0 home defeat to Southampton last weekend but served his ban in the Capital One Cup in midweek as Swansea swept aside Everton 3-0 to reach the last 16 of the competition.

Swansea boss Garry Monk has no new injury worries ahead of visiting the Stadium of Light, but defender Jordi Amat (knee) and midfielder Leon Britton (knee) are still absent.

Provisional squad: Fabianski, Rangel, Fernandez, Williams, Taylor, Ki, Shelvey, Routledge, Dyer, Sigurdsson, Bony, Tremmel, Richards, Tiendalli, Carroll, Montero, Emnes, Gomis, Bartley, Fulton.

Key match stats (supplied by Opta)

Sunderland conceded seven goals to Swansea last season, only Arsenal and Tottenham scored as many against the Black Cats.

Along with Liverpool, Swansea are one of two teams yet to draw this season. Sunderland have drawn a league-high four times this term.

After winning four games in a row in April/May, Sunderland have now gone six games without a victory (L2 D4).

Sunderland have kept three clean sheets in four Premier League home games against Welsh sides.

Sunderland have not won a Premier League game since May when Fabio Borini struck to score the Black Cats' second goal in a 2-0 victory over West Brom at the Stadium of Light

Swansea have kept only three clean sheets in their last 18 Premier League games.

Jonjo Shelvey has been booked in three of his five Premier League appearances this season.

Swansea have won just eight corners in five league games this season.

Gylfi Sigurdsson has assisted four Premier League goals this season; he has never recorded more than four in a single campaign in England.

Garry Monk’s Premier League win percentage of 42 per cent is better than Brendan Rodgers (32 per cent) or Michael Laudrup (27 per cent) recorded for the Swans.

Gus Poyet’s win percentage of 28 per cent at Sunderland is level with former Black Cats managers Steve Bruce and Roy Keane. Peter Reid (33 per cent) and Martin O’Neill (29 per cent) are the only bosses with a higher rate.
