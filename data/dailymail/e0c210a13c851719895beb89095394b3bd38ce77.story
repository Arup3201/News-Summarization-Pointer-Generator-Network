This is the excruciating moment a woman spends almost five minutes trying to forward park a car with no joy.  

A surveillance camera caught the female driver having trouble behind the wheel in a snow-covered Calgary parking lot this month with the clip going on to score more than 2.5million hits online.

The candid CCTV video shows her continually going back-and-forth turning the wheels at awkward angles and even pranging another vehicle at one point. 

She manages to do this despite having meters of room to play with.

After multiple attempts at getting the silver BMW X-Class SUV into position, she finally gives up and drives off.

A man goes out to try and help her at one point, not realizing that it was his motor she bumped into.

He is seen waving his hand in a bid to stop her reversing into another car.

After the clip hit the Internet, authorities launched an appeal to identify the driver, deeming it dangerous driving.
