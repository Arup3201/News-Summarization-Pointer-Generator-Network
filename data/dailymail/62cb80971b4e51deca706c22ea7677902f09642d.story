Fabian Delph has a big decision to make. His contract is running down at Aston Villa and he’ll soon be able to join any club for free. Now he’s an England international, he’ll be highly sought after.

Who knows, maybe even the likes of Chelsea and Manchester City will offer him a deal — they need to fulfil English quotas and he’s a talented player.

But a move like that is probably the worst thing Delph can do. Does he want to play regular first-team football for the rest of his career or become the next Steve Sidwell or Scott Sinclair, picking up wages but getting next to no playing time at a big club?

There was nothing wrong with Sinclair showing ambition when he joined Manchester City — a move almost impossible to turn down. But his career has gone backwards since.

James Milner won 50 caps and five trophies at the same club but has never been a regular starter. Maybe he’s comfortable with his contributions but sometimes if you’re not getting enough minutes, you need an exit strategy.

It doesn’t help when some clubs treat their players like commodities, offering them fabulous new contracts to protect their transfer value or hoarding them away to comply with player quotas. Then negotiations become like a game of Blackjack — does the player stick or twist?

The prospect of money and trophies is understandably tempting, but the focus should be on playing football and following a career path.

It happened to me when I left Arsenal. I had already played first-team matches but I was offered a deal over the summer by Aston Villa. I’ve never liked summer moves — you can get overwhelmed by money men — and had it been negotiated mid-season with games coming thick and fast, I’d never have left. But over the summer it becomes less about football and the money creeps into your head.

Leaving a top club might feel like the end of the big time but quick decisions have to be made for the benefit of your development. And it can work.

Daniel Sturridge moved from City to Chelsea before settling at another top club with Liverpool and Gary Cahill played for Villa and Bolton before moving to Chelsea. England manager Roy Hodgson will also look beyond the top four for his players, so international chances will still come.

Villa stuck by Delph when he injured his cruciate ligament so maybe he owes them. If he does leave, he must make sure he is going somewhere to play regularly.

On that note, it has been a good few weeks for English footballers. A lot of young players have shown they are not happy to warm the bench and it’s a reminder that this game is about more than just money. Danny Welbeck left his boyhood club for the chance to become a No 1 striker and Micah Richards, Tom Cleverley and Jack Rodwell all moved to play regularly again.

Whatever club you play for, it should hurt to the core every Saturday if you’re sitting on the bench. Your whole life has been spent training to play and every week you are gearing up for that moment. If you’re lucky, your career will last for 10-15 years, so you need to squeeze out every minute you can.

That’s why it’s been so good to see these young players not taking the easy option. They could sit on the bench counting their cash but they have shown the hunger to play and it’s that desire you want to see in every player.

PS Alex Song is a good example of the grass not always being greener. He was first choice at Arsenal before leaving for Barcelona in 2012. But was he realistically going to start ahead of Xavi, Iniesta, Busquets or Fabregas? He sat on the bench for two years but now wants a fresh start. His loan could prove to be good business by West Ham.
