The pastor of 'America's manliest church' has stepped down after being charged with DWI last week for driving home drunk from a bar.

Heath Mooneyham relinquished control of Ignite Church during this Sunday's service, contritely telling the congregation: 'My actions and behavior have led to grief and disappointment for my family, Ignite Church and the people of Joplin. For that I am truly sorry.'

Mooneyham, who is married and has three children, was arrested on September 16 after being stopped by police at 10.30pm in Joplin, Missouri and failing a breathalyzer test. He was charged with driving while intoxicated.

Heath Mooneyham, the controversial pastor of Ignite Church in Joplin, Missouri who gave away AR15 assault rifles to encourage reluctant followers through the door on Father's Day this year, has stepped down from the church after being charged with DWI

Mooneyham, a heavily-tattooed 36-year-old, launched his church in 2008 and is well-known for his bold tactics when it comes to converting followers. 

After finding his calling, the former small-business owner, who admits he spent several years off-the-rails in his early twenties, started his church at home. His audience has boomed to 800 faithful.

A recent article by Shane Dixon Kavanaugh for vocativ.com called the church the 'manliest' in America as at the institution's core, is a message to encourage a young, male audience, aged 18-35.  

Ignite's website leads with the message: 'Casual atmosphere, serious faith, no weird stuff.'

A typical Sunday sermon involves a live band, pounding out Christian rock anthems along with a message about loving God based on Bible teaching - although the subjects of sex, guns and drinking are not necessarily frowned upon. 

Church volunteers are called 'Rock Stars'. 

Slickly-produced videos on Ignite sermons are posted to YouTube and have titles such as 'Band Of Brothers', 'Spartan' and 'Grow A Pair'.

Earlier this year, Mooneyham, a Missouri native, featured a giveaway of two assault rifles at the church, in the hope of getting more followers through the door, vocativ.com reported.  

In a promotional YouTube video, where Mooney is pictured wearing a 'Drink Up Fortuitous One' t-shirt, he encouraged the reluctant faithful to come to church this Father's Day to have a chance of winning an AR-15 which is perfect for 'double-tapping a zombie'.

Despite a plethora of critics who disagree with his dubious methods of drumming up new recruits, he told vocativ.com: 'We love our God. We love our country. We love our trucks. And we love our guns.'

MailOnline was awaiting a comment from Ignite today but a church executive told the Joplin Globe that Mooneyham, who lives in a large house in the Ozark Mountains, would be undergoing alcohol addiction treatment and having time away from the church before it was hoped he could return.

Mooneyham, 36, also said in his statement, which was posted on YouTube, that despite his 'rough, tough, renegade preacher image' he had been self-medicating with alcohol at the end of a stressful day or as a way to forget reality. 

According to his own website, Mooneyham has three children Kyndal, Elijah and Charlie with his wife Kensey, whom he married in 2002. 

His message to find God's lost sheep is simple. 'We target 18-35 year old men. That’s it!' he writes online. 

'If we win the men, we win the women, the kids, the jobs, the town, the WAR! And we’ll do anything short of sin to accomplish this.'
