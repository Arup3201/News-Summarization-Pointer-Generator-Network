A childcare centre had to be locked down as police hunted an alleged car thief, following a one-hour chase through the streets of the Gold Coast.

Queensland Police report that a 17-year-old man was charged and will appear in court on Tuesday after he allegedly stole a limousine and then eluded authorities for up to 60 minutes on Monday.

The Police Helicopter was brought in to track his movements after the owner of the limousine company followed the teenager for a short while and vision from PolAir has now been released showing the dramatic conclusion to the chase.

Police were called in when reports were made about 'a vehicle being driven erratically along Pacific Motorway at Mudgeeraba'.

Several vehicles were brought in as the chase unfolded, officers trying unsuccessfully to intercept the vehicle but the driver failed to stop.

'The police helicopter was activated and provided advice to officers on the ground as to the location and direction of the vehicle.'

It was then that spikes were used to try and stop the chase on Mudgeeraba Road, police saying that three of the tyres were deflated as a result.

That's when the driver is believed to have pulled over near a local child care centre and jumped out of the car.

Gold Coast Senior Sergeant Bradyn Murphy told the Gold Coast Bulletin that the alleged offender jumped a fence and ran the Bambini Early Childhood Development Centre.

“It wasn’t the ideal location but the childcare centre was really good and straight away when the male offender has run through they have put the whole place into lock-down,' he told the newspaper.

PolAir was able to track the teenager and alert officers to nearby bushland where where he was found hiding. He was arrested at the scene and taken into custody.

The 17-year-old was charged with one count each of unlawful use of a motor vehicle, dangerous operation of a motor vehicle, fail to stop motor vehicle and driving a motor vehicle without a licence.

He is due to appear in Southport Magistrate Court on Tuesday.
