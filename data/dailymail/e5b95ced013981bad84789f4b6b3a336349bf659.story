Everyone who has spent time in the company of tired people knows that yawning is infectious, but now scientists have shown for the first time that chimpanzees can catch yawns from humans.

Swedish researchers believe a chimpanzee's susceptibility to catching yawns develops gradually with age, exactly as it does in humans.

Juvenile chimpanzees who are between five and eight years old catch human yawns but younger primates seem to be immune, according to the the study, which suggests that humans and other animals share a general developmental pattern.

Previous studies have proved that yawning together is not a sign of being tired at the same time and that contagious yawning among humans, chimpanzees, baboons and dogs could be a measure of empathy.

Researchers from Lund University, who carried out the latest study at Tacugama Chimpanzee Sanctuary in Sierra Leone, found yawning, but not nose-wiping was contagious.

They interacted with 33 orphaned chimpanzees aged between 13 months and 8 years and one researcher repeatedly yawned, gaped (opened her mouth without yawning) and wiped her nose with her hand to see how the animals responded.

The scientists found that while the younger chimpanzees did not respond to yawning, those five years and older yawned continuously.

As a way of examining the role that empathy with the yawner played for contagion, the study also compared the chimpanzees’ reactions towards yawns from their human surrogate mother and a stranger.

Cross-species yawn contagion has 
previously only been demonstrated in dogs.

Research suggests that man’s best friend yawns when he yawns, as a way of empathising with its master.

Contrary to prediction, there was no difference in the likelihood of yawning when engaging with an unfamiliar person from someone with whom the chimpanzees had a close relationship, questioning previous research that showed humans and animals tend to be more susceptible to catching yawns from those they are close to.

The developmental pattern found in the study is consistent with what previous research has found for humans.

Humans also show a developmental increase in susceptibility to yawn contagion, with children seemingly beginning to yawn contagiously around the age of four, at a time when empathy-related behaviours and the ability to accurately identify others’ emotions begin to manifest clearly. 

The scientists think that their research might reflect a general developmental pattern, shared by humans and other animals.

Given that contagious yawning may be an empathetic response, the results can also be taken to mean that empathy develops slowly over the first years of a chimpanzee’s life.

However, the researchers wanted to know why the chimpanzees did not differentiate between their surrogate mother and unfamiliar humans in the study.

'We do not have the full explanation yet, as it is a complex phenomenon that is being explored', said Elainie Madsen, a researcher in the study.

She believes there are at least two possible explanations.

One is that familiarity seems to play out differently in immature and adult individuals as the present study suggests that juvenile chimpanzees generalise their yawn responses to humans, irrespective of familiarity and attachment history.

In contrast, previous research on adult chimpanzees has shown that contagious yawning is targeted mostly towards familiar individuals.

This research on adult individuals has, however, been conducted on chimpanzees that have seen other chimpanzees yawn on video. The researchers are therefore cautious.

Cross-species yawn contagion has previously only been demonstrated in dogs. Previous research suggests that man's best friend yawns when he yawns, as a way of empathising with its master

'Future research will have to examine whether there might be multiple reasons for yawning in response to others’ yawns, and whether these differences apply differently within and between these two species.

'That is, whether chimpanzees may apply ‘targeted empathy’ to interactions with members of their own species – and selectively catch yawns from familiar chimpanzees - while they apply a more generalised form of empathy to interactions with humans' Dr Madsen said.

A reason for this may be that chimpanzees typically engage in competitive, even hostile, relationships with unfamiliar members of their own species, but rarely do so with humans, who they mostly experience as cooperative, according to the study.

She said: 'It is possible that younger chimpanzees switch from a "generalised empathy" to all individuals - irrespective of species - to a more "targeted empathy" as they mature into adults and possibly have stronger reasons to differentiate friends from foes', Madsen concludes.
