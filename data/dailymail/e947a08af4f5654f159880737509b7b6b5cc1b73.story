The man heading investigations into alleged corruption surrounding the bid process for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups will meet Qatari officials in Oman on Monday.

The independent inquiry by FIFA’s chief investigator Michael Garcia has taken on extra significance after further claims over the weekend about the scale of secret payments that helped Qatar win the World Cup. Prior to the latest revelations, FIFA were hoping the New York lawyer’s report would have been completed before the start of the World Cup in Brazil.

FIFA secretary general Jerome Valcke wanted a swift conclusion so there was no shadow hanging over the 2014 tournament which kicks off next week.

Allegations: Mohammed Bin Hammam is at the centre of the claims, with FIFA investigating the 2022 World Cup

Hosts: Qatar held off competition from Australia to win the rights to host the 2022 World Cup

But there now seems no hope of that happening as documents obtained by the Sunday Times have thrown the world governing body into chaos.

The newspaper claims that Qatari Mohamed bin Hammam, the former FIFA vice-president, used slush funds from 10 private  company accounts to make  dozens of payments in return for votes. The allegations include:

On Sunday, calls for a re-vote came from within FIFA’s own organisation, with vice-president Jim Boyce saying he would support such a move should corruption allegations be proven.

In an interview with the BBC, Boyce said: ‘I would have no problem if the recommendation was for a re-vote.

‘If Garcia reports that wrongdoing happened for the 2022 vote then  it has to be looked at very seriously.’

Reserving judgement: FA chairman Greg Dyke says if corruption allegations are proven the 2022 bidding process needs to start again

FA chairman Greg Dyke said: ‘Some of this  evidence, on the face of it, is quite compelling. If the evidence is there that the process is  corrupt, then obviously the process has to be looked at again.’FIFA’s communications department directed all media enquiries to Garcia and ‘the office of the chairman of the Independent Ethics Committee’.

Qatar’s World Cup bid committee issued a statement. It said: ‘Following today’s newspaper articles, we  vehemently deny all allegations of wrong-doing. We will take whatever steps are necessary to defend the bid’s integrity. The right to host the  tournament was won because it was the best bid and because it is time for the Middle East to host its first FIFA World Cup.’

But the Sunday Times report claims 65-year-old Bin Hammam was lobbying on Qatar’s behalf at least a year before the decision to award the country hosting rights.

In the past Qatar, and indeed FIFA, have insisted any such activity by Bin Hammam has centred around his attempt to secure votes for the 2011 FIFA presidential election, when he intended to stand against Sepp Blatter. He withdrew before the election.

Back in July 2011 Bin  Hammam was banned from football for life after being found guilty of  bribery. The ban was annulled a year later by the Court of Arbitration for Sport, which said there was insufficient evidence to support the punishment.

But FIFA then issued a second life ban in December 2012 for ‘conflicts of interest’ while acting as president of Asian football.

The latest allegations still fall short of exposing any FIFA executive  committee members requesting cash or favours in exchange for votes.

But John Whittingdale, chairman of the Commons Culture, Media and Sport select committee, said: ‘There have already been serious doubts raised about the capability of Qatar to host the 2022 World Cup on football grounds. If the choice of Qatar was as a result of improper payments being made, then that strengthens an already strong case for re-running the whole 2022 contest.’
