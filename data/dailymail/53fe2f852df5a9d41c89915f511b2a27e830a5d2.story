A first-grade student whose best friend is battling cancer decided that hours of playing and telling jokes was not enough - he wanted to show his buddy just how he understood the tough time he was going through. 

Five-year-old Vincent Butterfield decided the only way was to shave his head in support of his best friend Zac Gossage who lost his hair through chemotherapy. 

Zac was diagnosed last June with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. He is undergoing treatment but still goes to Union Central Elementary in Missouri every day - because that's where he gets to hang out with Vincent.

When the little boy was asked why he shaved his hair off, he told KSDK: 'To make Zac feel like he’s not the only one without any hair.'

Vincent has also been learning about cancer and raising money for his best friend after learning how expensive his chemotherapy treatments are.

He made more than 20 scarves and sold them, raising more than $200 to give to Zac.

The little boy's mom Karen Butterfield told KDSK: 'We had been making these scarves and he just kind of said it would be 
cool if we could make a whole bunch of these and sell them.'

When asked what friendship was, Vincent looked at his friend Zac and responded: 'It's a beautiful thing.'

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia is a fast-growing cancer of the white blood cells. The cancer, which attacks the blood and bone marrow, is most common in children aged two to five years old and has optimistic survival rates.
