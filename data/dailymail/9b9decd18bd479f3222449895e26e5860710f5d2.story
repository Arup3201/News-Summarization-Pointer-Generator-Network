Two prominent anti-aging scientists have shaken on a million dollar wager over who will live the longest.

Dmitry Kaminskiy and Alex Zhavoronkov placed the bet last month at an anti-aging conference and the deal is that the first one to die will immediately owe the other a million dollars in stock or cash.

Both men are evangelists for new drugs and technology that might extend the human life by fighting age-related diseases.

Shake on it! Both men are evangelists for new drugs and technology that might extend the human life by fighting age-related disease

Kaminskiy is a senior partner at Deep Knowledge Ventures in Hong Kong, while Zhavoronkov is the CEO of the anti-aging drug company Insilico Medicine in Russia.

They also believe that the competition is a way to combat psychological aging and ensure each man's continued desire to live. 

'If one of the parties passes away before the other, $1 million in Insilico Medicine stock will be passed to the surviving party,' the agreement stated, adding that if the company is no longer in existence the other has to pay up the dollar amount in cash.

Another condition of the bet is that both men have to live past 100 years. That will happen on February 24, 2079, when Zhavoronkov - who has just turned 36 - turns 100. He is a year younger than Kaminskiy.

'Longevity competitions may be a great way to combat both psychological and biological aging,' Dr. Zhavoronkov told Zoltan Istvan of Gizmodo. 'I hope that we will start a trend.'

Zhavoronkov has been taking low-dose aspirin since 1998 plus an anti-aging cocktail of statins and other supplements for over four and a half years is confident that he will win the bet.

He's also had an HPV shot to prevent cancer and takes other drugs to avoid getting the flu. 

However he admitted to ABC that Kaminskiy may have an advantage because he has family has a history of living longer, while he also enjoys a more stable sleeping pattern and regularly exercises.

'Access to a few hundred million dollars, state of the art information systems and a venture fund investing in longevity companies also helps,' said Kaminskiy. 

'But I still believe in the power of simple, affordable and reasonably safe interventions.'

The bet won't begin until both men are 100 years old and they aren't allowed to kill each other
