A New Jersey woman charged with manslaughter after a 22-year-old student died while getting illegal butt injections, was allegedly caught selling silicone kits online.

Tamira Mobley is facing manslaughter and assault charges over the death of Tamara Blaine, who was discovered foaming at the mouth and having a seizure in a pay-per-hour New York hotel last year.

But Inside Edition has revealed that it investigated Mobley in 2012 over claims that she was selling butt injection kits over the Internet for $600.

Home kit: Inside Edition confronted Tamira Mobley in 2012 after allegedly buying silicone injections from her website

Victim: Tamara Blaine died after suffering a seizure in a New York hotel, where police believe she had gone for butt enhancement injections

During an undercover investigation into the dangerous fashion for enhancing buttocks, the news magazine ordered a kit from a website allegedly run by Mobley.

When the $600 kit arrived, it contained 30 giant syringes filled with a substance Mobley's company - Butt Injections Kit - described as 'medical-grade silicone oil'.

When the substance was tested it was found to be an adhesive more commonly used in toothpastes and detergent.

The lab team that tested it said it was not sterile and potentially toxic.

Inside Edition confronted Mobley about the kit in a show, which is due to be broadcast tonight.

The show comes as the mother of Mobley's alleged victim revealed that her daughter's body laid unclaimed in a city morgue for more than a month after her death.

When Miss Blaine's mother Lola first filed a missing person report days after last seeing her daughter, she was told that because she was an adult and independent, she may have just gone away without telling anyone, the family's lawyer claimed.

'When I lost her, nobody helped me. When I looked for her, nobody was there for me. Everybody ignored me. Thatâ€™s just the way it is. I called the police. They didn't do anything,' Lola Blaine told DNA Info.

She finally learned of her daughter's death when the hospital that treated her on July 8, 2013, sent a bill to the family home, the Daily News reported.

Family lawyer Barry Weiss said he helped track down Miss Blaine's body, which was finally claimed on August 10, more than a month after she died.

The part-time college student was the mother to a five-year-old boy, Amari Bermudez.

The first autopsy, at the time of her death, had been inconclusive, but the missing person case became a homicide
 investigation in October, when a medical examiner noticed puncture 
wounds in the victim's buttocks, and found silicone in her blood.

The official cause of death was 'systemic silicone emboly due to a cosmetic silicone injection of the buttocks'.

Booking: Security camera footage shows Tamira Mobley arriving at the Liberty Inn hotel with Blaine in July 2013

Mobley was arrested on Monday after security camera footage at the Liberty Inn hotel and credit card records linked her to the room where Miss Blaine was found.

Prosecutors claim Mobley, 28, injected silicone directly into Miss Blaine's veins, which caused a seizure and eventually asphyxiated her.

She also allegedly waited about 90 minutes before contacting the hotel's front desk to ask them to call 911.

Mobley has admitted being with the victim on July 8, but she denied injecting her with silicone.

At her first court appearance on Tuesday Mobley was ordered to be held on $100,000 bail.
