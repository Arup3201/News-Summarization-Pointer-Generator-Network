Fame game: Former Detective Constable Dan Neal, 33, pictured, has caused controversy after quitting the Yewtree Operation to pursue celebrity in reality show Big Brother

A senior police detective has quit the Jimmy Savile sex abuse inquiry and is now pursuing fame on reality show Big Brother.

Bosses at Scotland Yard are said to be 
at furious former detective constable Dan Neal's decision to seek celebrity status on the back of 
Britain's biggest sexual abuse investigation.

They have raised concerns his appearance on the show could compromise Operation Yewtree, the
investigation launched following the Jimmy Savile sex abuse scandal.

Until recently, the gay father-of-one, 33, had been hunting celebrities who may also have carried out sex
attacks, either with the help of paedophile Savile or working alone.

But he is expected to be one of the show's most controversial contestants when he enters the house tonight.

'I think there will be some concern within the force', he told the Daily Express.

Mr Neal, from Ongar, Essex, said that he did not want to jeopardise a case he had worked on during the past eight months, adding: 'I can't talk about the content of the investigation but there may be a few concerned faces within my old department.'

A Met Police spokesman said: 'We are aware of reports concerning the proposed media appearance of a former detective constable.

'We've been in contact with Channel 5 and made them fully aware of potential risks and their responsibility to live investigations.

'All officers joining and leaving the Met are required to sign the Official Secrets Act.'

It is unclear if the former detective, who quit his job last month, applied to be a contestant on the
reality TV show while working for the Metropolitan Police.

Arrested stars include Jim Davidson, Rolf Harris, DJ Dave Lee Travis,
Freddie Starr, and Gary Glitter. They all deny the allegations.

Big Brother 2013 launches tonight on Channel 5 with a 'secrets and lies' theme, which includes a prison inside the house.

Concerns: A Scotland Yard child abuse detective who worked on Operation Yewtree will enter the Big Brother House, probably on Friday

Revealed: The officer will be inside the new Big Brother house (pictured), which has been unveiled as producers gear up for this summer's new series

His decision to become a reality star will shock Scotland Yard and producers
have said the child abuse expert has told them how life working on Yewtree and
its 400 lines of inquiry was 'upsetting' and 'draining'.

A show insider said the officer knows the confidential nature of his work
but understands 'it is only natural' that other contestants will try to get 'as much
gossip as possible' about the investigation.

Mr Neal also spoke about the hours he
spent sifting through evidence linked to Savile's decades of sexual abuse.

He also said he worked in a specialist team of 30 officers and was pleased
they had been able to make a difference to victims.

'The housemate knows they are going to hit the headlines over this. Leaving
the police force to go into the Big Brother house is a massive move,' a show
insider told the Daily Star.

'Their former bosses are going to be shocked about their decision to join
the show and naturally will be worried about what might be said inside the
house.

'This person has seen a lot of bad things while working on Operation
Yewtree. They will know what can and can’t be said inside the house but it’s
only natural for their housemates to want to try to get as much gossip as
possible.'

Channel 5 sought to allay fears something broadcast on Big Brother could compromise the on-going investigation.

A
 spokesman said: 'Extensive procedures are in place to ensure nothing 
will be broadcast with which would involve the former police officer 
breaching confidentiality, committing libel or a contempt of court.'

New pictures released this week revealed the house the new set of contestants will live in for the 
duration of this year's show.

Ready for action: The theme this year is Secret & Lies and the house is decked out with numerous secret rooms - including a prison

Not long now: This year will see Emma Willis take over the main hosting duties to replace Brian Dowling, but will the police officer keep quiet about his work at the Met

Not only have producers added an 
outdoor shower, no doubt in the hope to get some steamy viewing action, 
but they've also included a snug treehouse in the garden.

Its addition is no doubt put in place in a bid to encourage housemates to get some privacy away from the main building.

Other
 features include an outside shower, a 'prison' for any bad behaving 
contestants and an electricity generating bike in the bedroom.
