Keepers at the 150-acre Save the Chimps sanctuary in Fort Pierce, Florida, say it was 'love at first sight' when 32-year-old Iris clapped eyes on 40-year-old Abdul last month.

In safe hands: A chimpanzee who was allegedly left isolated in a 'hell hole' for years has finally found romance after being rescued and re-homed

Perfect match: Keepers at the 150-acre Save the Chimps sanctuary in Fort Pierce, Florida, say it was 'love at first sight' when 32-year-old Iris clapped eyes on 40-year-old Abdul last month

In March 2015 Iris was retrieved from a roadside zoo in Georgia following an undercover PETA investigation.

She had reportedly been kept alone in a 'tiny, barren, and dark cell' for three years.

With virtually nothing to do, she allegedly resorted to smearing her own feces on the walls of her enclosure and spent most of her time huddled under a dirty blanket.

She was also pale, overweight and her legs were underdeveloped because of a lack of opportunity to exercise.

After being transferred to the Save the Chimps facility, Iris was given immediate treatment.

A few days later, when vets had given her the all-clear, she was introduced to her next-door neighbor, Abdul.

Recalling the couple's first meeting, a spokesperson from Save the Chimps said: 'She kissed him and he groomed her.'

Over the coming weeks Iris will be introduced to more chimpanzees as she gains confidence. 

Save the Chimps is currently home to more than 250 rescued chimpanzees.

Some were in labs, some were in roadside zoos, and some had been neglected, abused or traumatized for years.

The inhabitants munch their way through around 1,300 bananas each day.  

PETA is currently seeking legal action against Iris' previous owners for animal cruelty.

However, they deny any wrongdoing. 

The park operators told NBC News that the chimp was 'well cared for' and 'doted on by humans' during her stay.

Commenting on Iris' story, Molly Polidoroff who runs Save the Chimps, said: 'Of course, there will be many more adjustments and introductions as she becomes used to her new home. 

'New faces, new friends, and best of all, life outdoors!'
