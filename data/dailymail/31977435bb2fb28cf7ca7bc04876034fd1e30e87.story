Aston Villa captain Ron Vlaar believes Roy Keane’s animal instincts will bring a necessary ‘fighting spirit’ to the club if he becomes assistant to Paul Lambert.

The Dutch defender praised the Manchester United legend and says his deep desire to win should boost a team who struggled against relegation last season.

Keane is expected to join Villa as Lambert’s No 2 once he returns from the USA with the Republic of Ireland next week.

‘I don't know him as a person, I know him as a player,' said Vlaar. 'He has a lot of fighting spirit, and I think that would be really good for us.

'He can do more than that. He’s a very strong character. On the pitch he could be absolutely… what's the word?’ Like an animal, it was suggested. ‘Yes - he wants to win and he shows that to his team-mates.

'I think everybody has a lot of respect for him and I look forward to it.’
