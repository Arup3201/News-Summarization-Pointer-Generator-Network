West Bromwich Albion have made an enquiry for Manchester United midfielder Darren Fletcher.

The Scotland international is out of contract in the summer and has yet to decide his future.

Albion manager Tony Pulis wants Fletcher's experience to help guide his players through the rest of the season and the 30-year-old is interested.

Fletcher wants to play and the move is tempting despite his strong allegiance to United. 

He recognises his game time will be limited as United continue to add to their squad this year but is still seen as a key part of the club.

The veteran holds influence in the dressing room alongside Wayne Rooney and Michael Carrick, and can be looked up to by the younger members of the squad.
