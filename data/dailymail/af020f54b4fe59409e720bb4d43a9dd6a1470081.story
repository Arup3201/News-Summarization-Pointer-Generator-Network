Rachel Reeves: Labour frontbencher is set for a Cabinet role if Ed Miliband wins the election in May

David Cameron yesterday distanced himself from remarks by a Conservative MP who questioned a Labour frontbencher's plan to go on maternity leave straight after the election.

Rachel Reeves hopes to become Work and Pensions Secretary if Ed Miliband wins power in May, but is due to have her second baby just five weeks later.

She said at the weekend that she would begin maternity leave shortly before her baby is due and stay away from work until September.

That prompted Tory MP for Romford Andrew Rosindell to say: 'I don't want to say someone who is having a baby is not eligible to be a Cabinet minister, but I certainly think perhaps the demands of that particular job will require someone to give it their full attention.

'I don't expect Rachel Reeves to be in the Cabinet after the election because I expect the Conservatives to win, but clearly people need to be put in the positions they can handle.'

Yesterday, however, when asked whether the Prime Minister believed a pregnant woman could serve in the Cabinet, Mr Cameron's official spokesman replied: 'Why on Earth not?'

He added: 'The Prime Minister's views around maternity leave (entitlements) is that they are universal, they apply to everyone and it is entirely a matter for individual families to take the decisions that they think are right for them, and the Government's job is to support them in those decisions they take.'

Despite Mr Cameron's support, Miss Reeves last night accused the Conservatives of having a 'women problem'. She wrote on Twitter: '300,000 women a year take maternity leave but @AndrewRosindell thinks can't do big job & be a mum. Tory women problem?'

The election Miss Reeves, 36, hopes will propel her into the Cabinet is on May 7, and she is due to have her second child on June 15.

She has said she believes she will have time before she goes on maternity leave to abolish the so-called bedroom tax – the reduction of benefits for claimants in social housing who are deemed to have more living space than they require, which ministers refer to as ending a 'spare room subsidy'.

Miss Reeves said: 'I'm having a child and I shall be on maternity leave for the early weeks and months of the next government.

Miss Reeves took to Twitter to hit back at criticism of the idea of taking maternity leave from the Cabinet

'The first thing I would do is abolish the bedroom tax. That's something I can do really quickly. My baby's due in June and I want to cancel the bedroom tax before I go on maternity leave.'

Jo Swinson, the Lib Dem minister for employment relations, yesterday joined the criticism of Mr Rosindell. She said: 'The suggestion that a woman should be turned down for a job because she is pregnant is clearly outrageous.

'That kind of discrimination would be illegal under employment law and is an appalling attack on the right of pregnant women to take on high-profile leadership roles in government or business. It echoes the outdated sexist view that women can't be good mothers and also good at their jobs.'

Mr Rosindell was last night unavailable for comment.

Miss Reeves, who is married to civil servant Nick Joicey, does not have a nanny or any formal childcare and relies mainly on her mother and aunt. She took five months' maternity leave from Parliament after her first child was born in March 2013.

During the election campaign she is expected to be one of Labour's most prominent public faces with regular TV appearances.

She has been pushed forward by Ed Miliband, becoming shadow chief secretary to the Treasury in 2011 before being promoted to shadow work and pensions secretary in 2013.

But she insisted last night that she does not want to become Labour leader, telling LBC radio: 'I see the sacrifices my leader Ed Miliband makes and the toll I think it must place on family life. It's not something that I want to do.'
