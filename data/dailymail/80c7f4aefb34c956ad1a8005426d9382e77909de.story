The high regard in which Phillip Hughes was held by those closest to him was clearly illustrated by a heartfelt tribute on Instagram posted by Kyly Clarke, wife of the opening batsman's best mate, Michael Clarke.

As the cricket community, led by the Australian skipper, converged on Hughes' home town of Macksville on the New South Wales mid-north coast for the funeral, Kyly Clarke let her emotions run free with the social media message.

She said: 'Today will always be remembered as the day we farewelled our friend way too early in life. We miss you now, we will miss you more tomorrow but we will never forget you!'

Kyly Clarke called Phillip Hughes 'my little Italian brother and our tour mate. Our Xmas lunch buddy, a friend we trust, our trivia partner, the guy who never was fussed!'

Kyly Clarke continued: 'That smile, that laugh, that cheeky little grin, your warmth, your love, the friend you've been. Our hotel room visits, my extra dinner date, my little Italian brother and our tour mate. Our Xmas lunch buddy, a friend we trust, our trivia night partner, the guy who was never fussed!

She concluded with a resounding message in capitals: 'WE LOVE YOU HUGH DOG, LIFE WON'T BE THE SAME, HERE'S TO THE DAY WE SEE YOU AGAIN! The Clarkes xoxo'.

The young man, who made history by scoring a century in each of his first 3 innings in English county cricket at age 20 and whose attack-minded unorthodox approach proved too much for the vaunted South African pace attack in his second test in 2009 when he made back-to-back centuries, will be farewelled by thousands of mourners at his old alma mater, Macksville High School.
