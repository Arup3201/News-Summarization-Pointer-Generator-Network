Pop star Cheryl Fernandez-Versini is as famous for her killer dance moves as her cute voice, and today the newlywed proved she's the queen of the twerk, showing off an UPSIDE DOWN version of the jiggling action on a behind-the-scenes video for her latest song Crazy, Stupid, Love.

The clip of the 25-year-old shaking her perfect backside against a studio wall was shared by her assistant Lily England with the caption: 
'The real behind-the-scenes of Crazy Stupid Love... @misscheryl was set 
the challenge to vertically twerk upside down - girl done good!!!!'

Since Miley Cyrus hit the headlines with her risque VMA routine in 2013 the booty-shaking craze has exploded onto to the mainstream dance scene, with sexy superstars Nicole Scherzinger, Nicki Minaj and Jennifer Lopez all happily bouncing around on stage. In fact the dance move has proved so popular that the term ‘twerk’ has been added to the Oxford dictionary and it was one of the most Googled terms of 2013.

Miley Cyrus made dance history at the 2013 VMAs, and hasn't stopped showing off her bottom since

And it's not just the superstars with thighs of steel. Energetic clubbers love twerking their way around the dance floors of Britain. And now there's a chance for amateur dancers to show off their best techniques in an official battle of the booties.

Next month the UK Twerking Championship arrives in London. Taking place on Thursday 14th August at the city's Scala nightclub, the event is predicted to be a sell-out as female twerkers compete for the coveted title of Miss Twerk Off 2014.

The dance-off is being organised by Jump 
Off TV, a hip-hop based content and events company, and hosted by MC Fontz and DJ Chuckie Online.Twelve finalists will compete in four rounds, including freestyle, jelly, splits and off the wall as well as posing for an official photo shoot.

Founder Harold Anthony from London told the MailOnline: ‘We started the company in 2003 and organised dance competitions on a weekly basis, but back than twerking was known as booty shaking.’

‘I heard about the Miley Cyrus’ performance and that twerking was becoming more socially acceptable,’ he added. ‘That’s when I decided to change the name and create the one of a kind twerking championship.’

Last year’s twerk off crowned Mizz 
Versatile as the UK's first ever twerking champion. The 20-year-old 
dance teacher from London first started twerking in May, a couple of 
months ahead of competing at the Jump Off Twerking Championships and 
took home the £200 winnings.

‘We
 had nine final contestants and 900 people turned up to watch the 
championships last year,’ explained Harold. ‘We have 12 contestants this
 year and hoping to fill the nightclub capacity again with four judges 
all from the dance industry deciding the winner.’

The dance craze started in the 1990s and was namechecked in songs by Beyonce and Justin Timberlake long before 2013

Although many think twerking began quite recently, in fact the popular craze started in the 1990s and was namechecked in songs by Beyonce and Justin Timberlake long before 2013, but it wasn’t until Miley Cyrus decided to twerk on stage at last year's VMA's that everyone started talking about it.

‘I don’t think anything can stop the booty-shaking craze,’ said Harold. ‘We’re even launching a twerking fitness class with Gymbox called tone and twerk soon.’

Bodyjam Twerkout in action: The bootyshake is a key exercise for any aspiring twerker

Les Mills, creator of fitness 
programmes including Bodypump, says it received a number of requests for
 a class featuring twerking moves following Miss Cyrus's controversial 
VMA performance.

As a result they adapted their existing Bodyjam class to incorporate a number of energetic twerking moves.

In addition to burning 530 calories 
per 55 minute session, research by Les Mills also reveals twerkers could
 see on average an eight per cent increase in pelvic bone density with 
regular participation.

Bone
 density is essential to avoiding osteoporosis in later life, meaning 
that twerking could help you avoid fractures or hip replacements in 
later life.

Gandalf 
Archer, Les Mills International Programme Developer comments on the 
craze and development of the Bodyjam programme, saying:

'We can't wait to get more people twerking their way to a better body.'

Dave Kyle, Head Trainer for Les Mills, offers his top five tips to get your rear in gear Bodyjam style:

1.
 Warm up with hip rolls, rotating your hips up, down, left and right, so
 your joints are suitably loosened for you to get your twerk on

2. Squats and pulses (a 'bounce' mid repetition) are ideal to get your back end looking great.

3. The bootyshake is a key exercise for any aspiring twerker. Integral to the Bodyjam workout the aim is to shake your rear whilst keeping the rest of your body still – really working those glutes

4. A signature move for Bodyjam, the 'tick tock' is an essential heel-toe grind to work up quads to rival Rihanna

5. DON'T stick your tongue out. It didn't work for Miley and it won't work for you!

Instead
 stick your bottom out at everyone opportunity, this pose will build 
your core to guarantee a whittled waist to set off your behind.
