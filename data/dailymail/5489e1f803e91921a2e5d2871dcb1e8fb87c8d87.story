There was a moment in the first half when Manchester City’s supporters rose to their feet to sing for the champions of English football.

Jose Mourinho turned to his assistants and asked in a dismissive tone whether they could hear them. Yes they could, Jose, loud and clear.

Chelsea’s increasingly irritable manager makes no bones about the fact he wants to get his hands on the Barclays Premier League again after City powered on to win it last season.

These are troubled times for Mourinho and he is fighting wars again after Diego Costa was banned by the FA for three games following that stamp on Emre Can last week.

Before kick-off there was a cursory handshake with Frank Lampard, a substitute for City here and a player Mourinho once described as the world’s best midfielder in a previous era.

To think there were times when Mourinho tried to take him to Inter Milan and even Real Madrid and their relationship has come to this. Perhaps there are no friendships in football any more.

He has fallen out with the broadcasters too, refusing to grant the 19 overseas TV channels who had made their way to Stamford Bridge an interview before the game. Come on Jose, you're way better than that.

The self-imposed gagging order did not last long, particularly when City’s supporters repeatedly told Chelsea’s manager to sit in the technical area.

Each time he acknowledged them, turning to them in the Shed and giving then a little wave with his left hand.

They baited Chelsea’s manager throughout, antagonising him with a series of put-downs and songs that are guaranteed to wind him up at the best of times.

He asks for it out there, jabbing a finger in the face of fourth official Jonathan Moss when he demanded more protection for Eden Hazard. On this occasion he had a point.

Mourinho is becoming a nuisance down there, behaving erratically as his team chase down honours in the Barclays Premier League, Champions League and Capital One Cup.

You would think that Mourinho, of all people, would be able to handle the unexpected events, such as Costa’s retrospective punishment, better than any other coach on earth.

He has, as Chelsea supporters sang, ‘won more than you’ after David Silva diverted Sergio Aguero's strike beyond Thibaut Courtois for City’s equaliser.

There is also the history with Manuel Pellegrini, with the pair sharing a mutual loathing for each other after they clashed during Mourinho’s spell as Real Madrid coach.

Last season, when Fernando Torres scored Chelsea’s last minute winner beyond Joe Hart, the coach jumped over bodies to find his son Jose Junior in the crowd to celebrate with him.

This time round he was bristling again, calling it on with the opposition, the referee Mark Clattenburg and occasionally City’s bench during this hard-fought game.

After this he will have to wait a little longer before he is champion again.
