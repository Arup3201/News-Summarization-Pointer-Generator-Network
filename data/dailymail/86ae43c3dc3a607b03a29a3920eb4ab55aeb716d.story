Paramount Pictures has become the first major Hollywood film studio to stop releasing movies on 35mm film in the U.S., meaning only theaters equipped with digital projectors will be able to show their upcoming releases.

The last Paramount movie to be available on 35mm will be the Will Ferrell comedy Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues, which opened in December.

It means Director Martin Scorsese's The Wolf of Wall Street starring Leonardo Di Caprio, has become the first major studio film to only be released digitally.

Curtain call: Paramount Pictures have becoming the first major film studio to stop releasing movies on the 35mm format and switch entirely to digital

With the other major studios expected to follow suit, there are fears that many small theatres, which have not yet upgraded to digital projectors, may be forced out of business.

Currently there are around 1,000 theatres across the U.S. that are not equipped to show movies digitally.

With digital projectors costing around $70,000, some are reportedly turning to members of the local communities in an attempt to raise the necessary funds.

The Wolf Of Wall Street, directed by Martin Scorsese and starring Leonardo Di Caprio, is the first film to be released in the U.S. purely on digital formats

Jan-Christopher Horak, director of the UCLA Film & Television Archive, told the LA Times: 'It’s of huge significance.

'For
 120 years, film and 35 mm has been the format of choice for theatrical 
presentations. Now we’re seeing the end of that. I’m not shocked that 
it’s happened, but how quickly it has happened.'

Director Martin Scorsese is leading calls to preserve decaying film prints for posterity

Both 20th Century Fox and Disney have warned theatre owners that it would stop distributing film prints within the next year or two.

One of the key advantages of digital systems is cost.  As many of the big film processing companies have now gone out of business, the price of a film print can be as much as $2,000.

Digital copies can be sent out for as little as $100 with some theatres now embracing satellite technology that allows movies to be beamed to them directly.

Digital technology also allows for the screening of 3D movies which allow theatres to charge a higher admission fee.

Paramount say they will continue to provide film prints of movies to theaters in Asia and Latin America. 

Despite his latest film being the first to not to be revelased on film, director Martin Scorsese has been leading calls to preserve decaying film prints for posterity.

Scorsese, who sits on the board of the National Film Preservation Foundation said: Film is history.

'With every foot of film that is lost, we lose a link to our culture, to the world around us, to each other, and to ourselves.
