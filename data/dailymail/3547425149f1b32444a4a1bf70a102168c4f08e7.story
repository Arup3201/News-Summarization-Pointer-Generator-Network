Voters could be forced to show their passport or driving licence to help prevent fraud

Photographic ID should be made compulsory in polling stations across the country, Britain’s elections watchdog warns today.

The Electoral Commission says the rest of the UK should follow the lead of Northern Ireland, where voters have long been required to prove their identity before they can cast their ballot.

The watchdog says the move is an essential step in tackling so-called ‘personation’ fraud, where an individual pretends to be someone else in order to use their vote.

It calls for a change in the law to ensure the new system is introduced by 2019 ‘at the latest’.

But sources close to the Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, who is in charge of electoral reform, last night said he was against the idea as it risked creating a system of ID cards by the back door.

Speaking in the Commons yesterday, Mr Clegg rejected a call from Tory MP Nick de Bois to introduce voter identification cards.

He said the introduction of individual voter registration - which requires voters to provide details such as their date of birth and National Insurance numbers - would ‘stamp out the problems of fraud’.

A source said: ‘We don’t believe that to vote in this country you should need an ID card. We are part of a Government that scrapped ID cards - this is slightly different, but it is not a million miles off.’ 

Individual voter registration replaces the traditional system where the head of the household was responsible for registering all members of the household.

But the Electoral Commission warns that by tightening up on postal ballot fraud, the new system could make Britain ‘more vulnerable’ to personation fraud.

‘Polling station voting in Great Britain remains vulnerable to personation fraud because there are currently few checks available to prevent someone claiming to be an elector and voting in their name,’ the report says.

‘This part of the system could become more vulnerable to fraud as other processes (including electoral registration and postal or proxy voting) become more secure.’ 

The watchdog says voters should be required to show their passport or driving licence at the polling station before they are permitted to vote. Those without either document would be eligible for a free ‘electoral identity card’.

Toby James, an electoral expert at the University of East Anglia, said introducing ID requirements would lead to lower turnout, with many voters not wanting the hassle.

Dr James said: ‘Requirements to produce passports and other forms of identification may sound reasonable enough, but they will have unintended consequences.

'They stop people voting. Imagine this scenario. You decide to vote on the way back from work. But after a busy day you realise that you forgot your passport. What do you do? Head back home, collect your passport and then vote? The answer for many citizens would be head home and stay there. 

That extra time is the difference between voting and not voting.’

Dr James said more evidence was needed about the extent of electoral fraud before such a major change is made.

The Electoral Commission said there was little evidence that introducing voter ID reduced turnout.
