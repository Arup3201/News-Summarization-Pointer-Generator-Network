He is the man who captured the nation's heart after winning a record-breaking 18 gold medals at the London games and becoming the greatest Olympian of all time.

But it seems that Michael Phelps' heart was already taken.

The 27-year-old has quietly been dating a Los Angeles-based aspiring model and actress for the past six months, which might come as a shock to his legion of female fans.

Following their first appearance together as they left a London nightclub in the early hours of Sunday morning, the couple made it truly official on Monday night when they walked the red carpet together at a Speed-sponsored event.

Posing publicly: Michael Phelps had his arm around girlfriend Megan Rossee as they attended an event Monday evening at London's Kensington Roof Gardens

Eying the camera: Insiders are saying that Rossee, seen arriving at the Monday event with Phelps behind her, is using the Olympian for his fame in an effort to boost her modeling career

Phelps allegedly decided to 
keep his relationship with Megan Rossee under
 wraps so he could concentrate on succeeding at the Olympics.

But it seems the pretty blonde has not been as guarded about her blossoming romance with the swimming star.

Rossee has frequently broadcast her relationship with Phelps on Twitter, posting a number of intimate photographs of him.

The 25-year-old has also called him pet names in a number of public Tweets. 'Good luck tonight bear,' she posted on August 2, the day of the men's 200m individual medley final.

Five days earlier, Rossee Tweeted a 
personal message to the most-decorated Olympian of all time, saying: 
'@MichaelPhelps this probably will get lost in your tweets but since i 
cant text i miss you and cant wait to spend time with you for real xo.'

Her supportive messages began in 
June, when she Tweeted: 'idk how to direct msg u and don't wanna wake u 
up but just watched your swim :) good job today and can't wait to be 
there @MichaelPhelps.'

But her willingness to publicise their relationship has led some to speculate that she is only in it for the fame.

'Michael is like a puppy dog around Megan – he’s completely in love with her,' a source told Radar.

In the entourage: Rossee's identity was not immediately known but later sightings prompted confirmation that the pair were dating

'However, like any young girl hoping 
to make it in Hollywood, she’s ambitious and knows that by associating 
herself with Michael she will get a lot of press herself.

'She’s desperate for her own fame – her career has been a slow-burner but this will certainly accelerate it.'

Rossee reportedly works as a cocktail waitress at Blok nightclub in Hollywood to supplement her earnings from modelling.

'Now
 that people know who she is, Megan is hoping that she will get more 
offers for photoshoots and her modeling and acting career will finally 
take off,' the source added to Radar.

Twitter: Rossee posted this picture alongside the caption: 'Cuuuuties @MichaelPhelps: Happy to get sometime with the pups today before i leave!!'

'Michael adores everything about 
Megan, she’s athletic, makes him laugh and she’s obviously drop dead 
gorgeous. But what happens when the buzz of the Olympics dies down and 
life goes back to normal? Will she want to date a retired swimmer?

Rossee's father, Wayne Rossee, today confirmed the pair's relationship to Celebuzz, saying: 'Yes, it’s true. I haven’t met him yet. I will soon. He’s been kind of busy.'

The man from Lakewood, California, said the pair want to go travelling after the Olympics to spend some quality time together.

On her Model Mayhem profile, Rossee 
writes: 'I am super easy going and pretty much down for any type of 
project (that doesn't involve nudity).

'I love what I do and hope to further my
 career as a model as well as a performer, so if you are interested in 
working with me, send me a message!'

Rossee,
 who is a keen soccer player, reportedly accompanied Phelps to the 
Olympic trials in Omaha and to the Games in London. The model has been 
so busy travelling with her beau that she has had to refuse work.

'This summer has turned out to be very 
busy for me, so I am no longer accepting TFP unless hair/makeup or 
wardrobe are provided, or if the project is something my portfolio is 
lacking,' she added to her modelling profile.

Phelps is reportedly keen for her to 
quit her bartending job and take up modelling full time. 'He hates that 
she still works at Blok,' a source told Radar.

'Michael
 is completely besotted with Megan and now that he’s retired is even 
thinking of popping the question,' the source added.
