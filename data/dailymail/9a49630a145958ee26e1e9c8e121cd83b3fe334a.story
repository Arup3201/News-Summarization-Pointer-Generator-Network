A Senegalese immigrant who claimed to be under an evil African spell has pleaded guilty to fatally stabbing an Italian college student in her New York City apartment.

Bakary Camara, 42, admitted on Monday to raping and murdering 36-year-old Rita Morelli, his former lover, last November.

The native of Italy's Spoltore region attended the Borough of Manhattan Community College and worked as a waitress. Her body was found by her boyfriend.

Killed: Bakary Camara, the man accused of killing Rita Morelli (pictured) last year, has requested a witch doctor take the stand as an expert witness to prove he was under a curse that made him kill

Police say Camara was traced to his 
Bronx home after he made a cryptic 911 call about the body. Authorities 
say Camara stabbed himself in the stomach as police officers approached 
and directed them to a note describing his failed relationship with Miss
 Morelli.

Camara faces 25 years to life in prison when he is sentenced October 30.

During his trial, he attempted to 
call a witch doctor to stand as an expert witness in the trial -- a 
bizarre move that prosecutors have branded 'clearly irrelevant' as they 
fight against it.

'It is difficult to imagine how a witch doctor could be qualified in a court of law,' lead prosecutor Evan Krutoy wrote to the judge last week, the New York Post reported.

'The defense cannot credibly argue that witchcraft is a profession [with] scientific knowledge or skill.'

Camara was accused of slashing Miss Morelli's throat and stabbing her multiple times on November 23 last year. Her body was discovered by her live-in boyfriend.

Victim: Morelli, 36, met Camara at a designer clothing store where they both worked in New York City and began a relationship. She was living with a new boyfriend when she was found murdered

Workplace: They met at this clothes shop, where Camara was a security guard and Morelli worked in sales

Miss Morelli, who was a student at Hunter College and a waitress at Caffee Buon Gusto in New York, had been living in the city for five years, pursuing 'the American Dream,' her family said.

Camara had met his victim in 2010 while he worked as a security guard in a designer clothing store,  7 For All Mankind, where she worked in sales.

In a rambling, four-page letter found in his pocket during his arrest in the days after the murder, Camara claimed a curse had pushed him to kill.

'They put a curse on me,' the father of two, who was born in the U.S. but raised in Senegal, wrote. 'They make you do 
anythings. Could make you die fast or go to jail. You always be mad 
and sad. This is a curs.

'There is something in my mind tell me 
you have to do this you have to anything bad make thing bad thing hurt 
people. I always think to make a suicide but I 
can’t. I only think to get kill. I meet that girl Rita Morelli we was 
very friend for nine months before we have a relationship.'

The letter explained that he went to her home around 8pm and then killed her.

He reportedly called police from a phone box to tell them to check her apartment, and when they called contacts in her mobile phone, they recognised Camara's thick accent when he picked up.

The victim's family are outraged that Camara, is blaming the killing on a 'curse'.

'It’s nonsense and ridiculous,' her cousin, Giorgio Morelli, told the Post. 'It's an insult for Rita’s parents, who have been suffering so much. And an insult for innocent women who, every day, face the acts of violent men like Mr. Bakary Camara.'

Jury selection for the trial commences on Tuesday. If Camara is found guilty of first-degree murder, he faces a maximum sentence of life in prison without parole.
