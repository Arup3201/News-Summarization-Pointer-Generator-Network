Explosive leaked emails have laid bare for the first time the depth of the bitter feud between Ed Miliband and Ed Balls.

The emails, sent last week and obtained by The Mail on Sunday, reveal that the Labour leader’s team think Mr Balls is a ‘nightmare’.

They prove the two are deeply divided over how to respond to the economic revival.

And they indicate Mr Miliband is sick and tired of the shadow chancellor’s refusal to obey his orders and ‘stay on message’.

United front? Ed Miliband with Ed Balls are said to have had a number of behind-the-scenes rows

Publicly, the two men have always 
denied reports of long-running personal and political simmering 
tensions, and of heated behind-the-scenes rows between them and their 
rival camps.

Privately, the 
emails paint a very different picture and leave no doubt that relations 
between them are as bad as critics have long suspected.

The
 emails were sent on Wednesday in response to Bank of England Governor 
Mark Carney’s announcement that the economic recovery had finally taken 
hold. ‘The glass is half full,’ he declared.

In
 its most optimistic set of forecasts for years in the latest quarterly 
inflation report, the Bank raised its outlook for growth and jobs and 
reduced its outlook for inflation.

But the rosy forecast posed another test for relations between Miliband and Balls.

The
 Labour leader is known to disagree with Mr Balls’s refusal to accept he
 was wrong to predict Coalition policies would trigger a double-dip 
recession.

And the shadow 
chancellor’s continued use of his mocking ‘flat-lining’ gesture with his
 hand to David Cameron – when the economy is on an upward path – is 
regarded by Mr Miliband as another blunder.

After
 the Bank of England announcement, Mr Balls wasted no time in seizing 
control of Labour’s official response, before Mr Miliband had the chance
 to do so.

He told his senior adviser Alex Bellardinelli to email Mr Miliband’s aides, informing them of his response to the new forecast.

Mixed messages: Extracts from emails sent by the Balls team, top, and the Miliband camp, below

Around
 a dozen influential Labour figures received the roundrobin email. They 
included the former Treasury mandarin Torsten Bell, Mr Miliband’s chief 
economic adviser and a former aide to ex-Chancellor Alistair Darling, Mr
 Balls’s most powerful Labour critic.

In
 the terse email, which echoes reports that Mr Balls resents deferring 
to Mr Miliband, Mr Bellardinelli wrote: ‘Could we get this out pls? 
cleared at this end [by Balls] and essentially the same script as we had
 on GDP day the other week.’

Mr
 Balls’s 200-word statement began: ‘After three damaging years of 
flatlining . . .’ a phrase Mr Miliband now avoids. Mr Balls went on to 
complain about the ‘cost-of-living crisis’,
 called for a ‘recovery that’s built to last’ and an ‘economy that works
 for working people’. Less than 15 minutes later, Mr Bell forwarded the 
email to fellow Miliband loyalist,
 Greg Beales, the Labour leader’s head of strategy. In withering terms, 
Mr Bell wrote at the top of the email: ‘As an example of why we’re 
having problems on EB (EdBalls) messaging – this is his current three-part argument: Cost of living; Recovery built to last; Economy works for working people.’

Mr
 Bell signed off with his own damning, one-word assessment of Mr Balls: 
‘Nightmare’. He did not send the reply to Mr Balls’s office.

Ten minutes later, Mr Beales replied to Mr Bell in equally scathing When did built to last become a part of our thing?’

Today’s
 disclosure of the backroom sniping between Balls and Miliband will do 
little to increase their low ratings in opinion polls.

Surveys show that voters are sceptical about the prospect of the pair running the economy.

And
 the leaked emails are bound to be used by Prime Minister David Cameron 
and Chancellor George Osborne to reinforce Tory claims that their Labour
 rivals cannot be trusted with the nation’s purse strings.

A
 spokesman for Ed Miliband said last night: ‘Ed Balls was entirely 
right. After three damaging years of flatlining, there is no recovery 
for millions of families.

‘Prices
 are rising faster than wages, and figures this week showed that people 
are on average £1,600 a year worse off since David Cameron came to 
office.’
