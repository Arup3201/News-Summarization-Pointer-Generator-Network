If you've ever bitten into deep fried ice cream, you might have experienced a taste and texture that was out of this world - in more ways than one.

That's because, according to Nasa, the structure of Comet 67P - which Esa's Rosetta spacecraft is currently orbiting - resembles the popular dessert.

In an experiment, they found that while the exterior of a comet is encased in a hard, outer crust, the interior would mostly be fluffy ice.

Nasa scientists in California say comets are like deep fried ice cream. The analogy was made after an experiment on Earth called Himalaya looked at how comets evolve over time. It suggests they have a hard exterior but a soft and fluffy interior. Shown is a mosaic of comet 67P taken by Rosetta on 3 February 2015

'A comet is like deep fried ice cream,' said Dr Murthy Gudipati of Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, corresponding author of a recent study appearing in the Journal of Physical Chemistry.

'The crust is made of crystalline ice, while the interior is colder and more porous.

'The organics are like a final layer of chocolate on top.'

Esa's Rosetta spacecraft launched on 2 March 2004 aboard an Ariane 5 rocket, on a mission to visit comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko.

It took more than ten years to reach the comet, and on the way it flew past Mars and two asteroids.

On 6 August 2014 it entered orbit around the comet, beginning a series of complex manoeuvres to get the best views possible.

On 12 November 2014 Rosetta successfully released a smaller vehicle it had carried called Philae. This small probe bounced twice on the surface before coming to rest.

Although Philae's landing did not go as planned, it was still able to complete more than 90 per cent of the science it was intended to do before its main batteries died, sending the probe to sleep.

The location of the lander is currently unknown. It is thought to be in partial shadow near a cliff but, as the comet approaches the sun, the additional light may charge its solar panels enough for the lander to wake up.

Rosetta, meanwhile, is continuing its mission around the comet. 67P is approaching the sun and, by August this year, it is thought its activity will have dramatically increased.

This will release much more ice, vapour and other materials from the surface - and Rosetta will be there to watch it all happen. 

To come to the conclusion, astronomers used an icebox-like instrument nicknamed Himalaya.

They showed that fluffy ice on the surface of a comet would crystallise and harden as the comet heads towards the sun and warms up.

While researchers had already known that comets had soft interiors and hard crusts, based on data from Rosetta, their exact composition and how they formed had remained unclear.

In this study, the researchers used labs on Earth to model how a comet's crust crystallised.

The experiments began with amorphous, or porous, ice - the proposed composition of the coldest comets and icy moons.

In this state, water vapour molecules are flash-frozen at extremely cold temperatures of around 30 Kelvin (-243°C or -405°F).

This preserves disorderly states in the comet, so water molecules are mixed with other molecules, like organics, and remain frozen.

According to Dr Gudipati, amorphous ice is like cotton candy - light and fluffy, and filled with pockets of space.

The researchers then used the Himalaya cryostat instrument to slowly warm their amorphous ice mixtures from 30 Kelvin to 150 Kelvin.

This mimicked the conditions a comet would experience as it journeys towards the sun.

The ice was also infused with a type of organics, called polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, or PAHs, which are common in space, to mimic the composition of the comet.

How did water come to exist on our planet? Most scientists are of the opinion that it didn't begin here on Earth, instead being transported from elsewhere in the solar system, but whether it came from an asteroid or a comet was a mystery.

That was one of the key questions Esa was hoping the Rosetta mission would solve when it arrived at comet 67P in August, and it mayn now have an answer.

Using the Rosetta Orbiter Spectrometer for Ion and Neutral Analysis - or Rosina - the spacecraft 'sniffed' the comet's atmosphere as it remained in orbit and analysed its composition.

It found that water in the comet's atmosphere had a different ratio of deuterium-to-hydrogen than water on Earth.

The results were seemingly confirmed by the Philae lander on the surface.

However, some scientists have pointed out that not all comets are the same - and others may match the water on Earth.

The debate over whether asteroids or comets brought water to Earth - or even both - looks set to continue for the foreseeable future. 

The results came as a surprise.

'The PAHs stuck together and were expelled from the ice host as it crystallised,' said Dr Antti Lignell of Caltech.

'This may be the first observation of molecules clustering together due to a phase transition of ice, and this certainly has many important consequences for the chemistry and physics of ice.'

With PAHs kicked out of the ice mixtures, the water molecules had room to link up and form the more tightly packed structures of crystalline ice.

'What we saw in the lab - a crystalline comet crust with organics on top - matches what has been suggested from observations in space,' said Dr Gudipati.

'Deep fried ice cream is really the perfect analogy, because the interior of the comets should still be very cold and contain the more porous, amorphous ice.'

The composition of comets is important to understanding how they might have delivered water and organics to the young, hot Earth.

New results from the Rosetta mission show that asteroids may have been the primary carriers of life's ingredients; however, the debate is ongoing and comets may have played a role.

For Dr Gudipati, comets are capsules containing clues not only to our planet's history but to the birth of our entire solar system.

'It's beautiful to think about how far we have come in our understanding of comets. Future missions designed to bring cold samples of comets back to Earth could allow us to fully unravel their secrets,' he said.
