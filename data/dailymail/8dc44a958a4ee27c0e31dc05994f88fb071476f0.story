Corraine Casey gave off the impression of being the perfect mother while hiding a heroin addiction

A former drug addict who started using heroin when she had two young children has spoken of her own battle with drugs and who like Peaches Geldof appeared to be the perfect mother.

Corraine Casey, now 35, started using the drug when she had two young children and even fell pregnant with her third child Georgia while she was still using.

Her story echoes that of Ms Geldof, also a mother to 23-month-old Astala and 11-month-old Phaedra, who was found dead at her home in Kent last month.

Today it was confirmed at the opening of an inquest that heroin played a role in her tragic death.

In a case of history repeating itself, Peaches' own mother Paula Yates died from an accidental heroin overdose in 2000, aged 41.

Both Ms Casey and Ms Geldof had to deal with the death of a parent at a young age and then juggled bringing up two very young children, seeming to be perfect mothers.

Ms Casey said: 'Our stories are pretty similar. We both had traumatic childhoods and both lost a parent. I was a young mum struggling with grief and the drugs offered me a refuge from that pain.

‘I juggled drug use and two small babies and nobody had a clue. To the outside world I was the perfect mum.

‘I wouldn’t be surprised if it was the same for Peaches.

‘If it is the case I feel desperately sorry that she didn’t get the help she needed. I did and it saved my life meaning my children didn’t have to grow up without a mother.

‘I am so grateful for that.

‘It sounds awful but without it I wasn’t able to be a mother because I simply could not function.

‘It got to the point where I needed heroin to be able to be a mum. I couldn’t cook the dinner or clean up without it. I told myself I had to keep using to be a good mum.’

Ms Casey, of Lincoln kept her addiction a secret from her family and friends by not seeing them as frequently and making sure there were no visible signs of drug use.

And she believes it would have been even easier for someone in the public eye to hide an addiction.

‘We only see what they want us to see. Peaches would have been able to prepare for TV appearances by getting her hair and make up done and making sure she was on form and presentable, ' she speculated.

‘But that doesn’t mean it wasn’t a different story at home.

‘You can give off the impression of being a fantastic parent while being addicted to heroin. I know because I did it and it would have been even easier with more money.

‘My mother had no idea at all I was a heroin user.

‘I would tidy the house and make an extra effort with my hair and make up to look fit and well. It’s easy to make people see what you want them to see because they believe what they want to believe.

‘Nobody wants to believe that a young mum responsible for two babies is addicted to heroin so if anyone ever questioned me I told them not to be silly and that was the end of it.’

But behind closed doors Corraine’s use of heroin was affecting her parenting.

She added: 'If I had taken the drug I was happy and able to play with the children in the park and run the home, but of course that had financial implications because we had little money.

‘Once I sold the TV to pay for heroin and the house was always cold because we couldn’t afford heating.’

‘I told myself that it was OK because I needed the drugs to be a good mum. Only later when I got clean could I see how twisted that idea was.’

Corraine said that nobody wanted to believe that a young mum responsible for two babies was addicted to heroin

The former addict only managed to turn her life around after her third daughter, Georgia was born in August 2002.

It was the shame of giving birth to a daughter addicted to drugs that made her seek help.

She explained: ‘Through my pregnancy I kept telling myself I would stop. But without it I was a wreck. I needed it to get through the day.

'It was only then that the gravity hit me because the drugs had kept me numb. When I saw my baby lying in hospital I broke down.

‘I had been kidding myself that I could be an addict and a good mum, but I had failed my children in every sense.’

She fell pregnant again with her ex partner, but still managed to stay clean and left him a year later.

She then met her husband and has had another three children. She is proud never to have touched drugs again and recently admitted the truth about their childhood to her children

Ms Casey, who now works as a peer mentor advisor helping other young addicts said: ‘Thankfully I am here to tell them the story. It could have been very different as what may have happened to Peaches shows.

‘They were very shocked but very understanding and supportive. I have raised lovely compassionate children and only hope my story helps others get help before it’s too late.’
