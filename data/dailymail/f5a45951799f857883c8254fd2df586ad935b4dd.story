Celebrity friends: Alex Hope, seen partying with Desperate Scousewives star Layla Flaherty has been revealed as the trader  who ran up a £203,948.80 bar bill

A self-proclaimed City whizzkid who spent more than £200,000 on Britain’s most expensive round of drinks has been criticised by his unemployed mother over his apparent night of excess.

Alex Hope, 23, who claims he has earned a fortune by trading foreign currencies, is said to have forked out £125,000 on a single bottle of champagne along with £60,408 on other beverages and a £18, 540 tip.

But his mother Tina Hope, 53, who lives in a three-bedroom terrace house in Deptford, south-east London, is shocked he could blow so much money at a time while millions of people are struggling to survive.

The 53-year-old, whose home is worth 
as much as her son’s bar bill, said ‘I just hope he 
didn’t drink it all himself.'

‘I should suppose not. He’s a very good boy. I’m surprised by all of this,’ she told the Daily Express.

Mr Hope, who lives in a Docklands apartment two miles from his mother, claims to have enjoyed a meteoric rise since leaving school.

He says he began currency trading in his bedroom and also worked on market stalls and as a burger flipper.

On his blog – alexhopefx, which has now had access restricted – he boasts: ‘Alex knows and loves the FX market. Throughout his youth, his passions were football and…currencies! 

‘At the age of 11, Alex had a deep-rooted interest in the different currencies and relished trips across Europe where he could explore this interest first hand.

‘Opening his first account with just £500, in one day he’d doubled his money and turned the £500 into £1,100 by trading gold.’

‘A talented, charismatic and thoroughly likeable man, Alex Hope exudes knowledge and you can’t help but respect and admire this self-taught and self-made young trader. Watch out trading markets, Alex Hope is kicking up a storm!

Mr
 Hope booked a table at the UnderGround night club at Liverpool’s 
Hilton Hotel and ordered the 30-litre bottle of Armand de Brignac in 
advance of his visit on Sunday night, according to bosses.

He
is said to have entertained celebrity guests, including Manchester City footballer Adam Johnson and Man United star Wayne Rooney’s wife Coleen.

Two waiters were needed to carry in the bulky 99lb Nebuchadnezzar-size bottle of champagne, which is the equivalent of 40 standard ones.

He also ordered 40 single bottles of Ace of Spade champagne along with £4,000 worth of Grey Goose vodka, which he handed them out to women there last night.

Mr Hope settled the bill for £203,948.80 after paying a 10 per cent service charge – worth a massive £18, 540 – on top of the £185,408.80 drinks total.

Although there is some scepticism about the receipt, which was released hours after the party, Mr Hope has been pictured with other celebrities in the past and has been seen drinking Amand de Brignac.

In January he was photographed with Desperate Scousewives star Layla Flaherty at a party in London.

Of Sunday night, one clubber said: ‘The club went wild when he popped this huge bottle of champagne, and they were handing out glasses of champagne to everyone in the VIP room.

Armand de Brignac is a non-vintage Champagne made by Champagne Cattier.

It was introduced in 2006 and is a product of the Cattier family's Premier Cru vineyards.

The bottle drunk by the businessman
 Armand de Brignac Brut Gold is identifiable by its gold bottle with 
pewter Ace of Spades on its label.

It is described on its website as a
 'sumptuous racy fruit character that is perfectly integrated with the 
wine's subtle brioche accents'.

The bubbly contains Chardonnay, Pinot Noir and Pinot Meunier.

Has been named the number one champagne in the world after blind tasting by wine experts.

‘Frankly there was no way all his group would have got through the bottle on their own anyway.

‘This guy was phenomenally generous and was buying everyone in the place a drink.

‘Funny thing was though that he 
didn't seem to be drinking much himself and looked totally sober but he 
was clearly having a great time.’

Nightclub
 boss George Panayiotou ordered the DJ to play The Dawn of Man, the 
iconic anthem to the film 2001: A Space Odyssey, as the huge bottle was 
carried through.

The clubber added: ‘The party went off with a bang and everyone was toasting this guy's generosity.

‘He was there with about 10 friends on a private table but after the big bottle came in they were mobbed with gorgeous girls.

‘There
 must have been about 60 of them at any time vying for his attention and
 he then ordered shots for every single woman in the club.’

Venue: Outside the night club in Liverpool

Manager of the club Vasco Carealho 
said of Mr Hope: 'He was in the club on Saturday and he had pre-ordered the bottle. He has been to the club a couple of times.

'The fact he wanted to order 
something like that was unusual and it was a surprise but we welcomed it
 and we just created the best spectacle for the service of the bottle.'

The club has been open since December 16.
