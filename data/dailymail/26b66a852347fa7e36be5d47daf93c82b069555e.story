Up to 320,000 homebuyers with  interest-only mortgages risk losing their property because they are struggling to pay, the financial regulator warned yesterday.

The figures, based on research by the Financial Services Authority, reveal they have either missed or struggled to make a payment on loans which are specifically designed to be more affordable.

The scale of the problem follows recent warnings of a ‘ticking timebomb’ of interest-only mortgages.

Big dipper: Mortgage rates have plunged over the last five years but, if they were to rise suddenly, thousands of people on interest-only deals would struggle to keep up with their repayments

Of the 11.2million mortgages in 
Britain, around 35 per cent are interest-only, meaning that the 
homebuyer pays only the interest every month, but not a penny of the 
capital.

In theory the mortgage-holder should 
save to pay off the capital at the end of the term, but nearly 80 per 
cent have no repayment strategy, according to the FSA. They have been 
categorised as ‘mortgage prisoners’.

Others have been saving, but have been
 bitterly disappointed by how their investments, such as endowments, 
have performed.

The regulator said between 5 and 8 per cent of these 
loans are ‘in forbearance’, which means the homeowner has either missed a
 payment, or made the payment late.

Default: The tactic of putting people on interest-only mortgages has helped to keep repossessions low. They peaked at 48,300 in 2009

Experts warn that homeowners have 
little chance of keeping a roof over their heads if they cannot afford 
such mortgages with interest rates at a historic low.

For more than 
three years the Bank of England has kept the base rate at 0.5 per cent.

An interest-only mortgage offers a cheaper way to purchase a property
 than with a capital repayment mortgage, because borrowers are only 
paying off only the interest and not the capital.

For example, a 
£150,000 homeloan at 5 per cent over 25 years would cost £625 per month 
interest-only, and £877 per month capital repayment.

But at the end of the mortgage term, the interest-only loan will have
 paid off only the interest - leaving the original £150,000 debt to be 
repaid, whereas the repayment mortgage would have cleared the debt.

Erik Britton of financial consultants Fathom said: ‘We are creating 
zombie households that can only stay in their properties if interest 
rates are 0.5 per cent.’

Despite the base rate being frozen, 
around one million homeowners will be hit next month by a jump in 
standard variable mortgages.

The average increase is 0.62 percentage 
points, adding £53 per month to a typical £150,000 mortgage.

Before the credit crunch in 2007, it 
was easy for a homeowner to take out an interest-only mortgage without 
providing any evidence of how the actual loan would be paid off.

Other 
research by the FSA, published in December, shows the extent of the 
problem as these loans come to the end of their life, but the borrowers 
have no money to pay them off.

Between 2011 and 2020, it expects around 1.5million interest-only mortgages worth £120billion will be due for repayment.

Questioned by MPs recently, Martin 
Wheatley, a director of the Financial Services Authority, said: ‘There 
is a ticking timebomb that has been created over the last 20 years.’

To make matters worse, it will soon become much more difficult for homeowners with an interest-only loan to remortgage.

When new FSA rules come into force, 
probably in 2013, it will be impossible to take out an interest-only 
mortgage unless you can prove you are saving to pay off the loan.

A spokesman for the British Bankers’ 
Association said: ‘Banks are committed to treating customers 
sympathetically and will help where they can.’
