Oregon's governor is facing some uncomfortable questions on Friday, once again over his fiancée, after it was revealed that she was paid $118,000 from an out-of-state company while acting as an adviser to him.

Governor John Kitzhaber, 67, is set to explain at a press conference why 47-year-old first lady, Cylvia Hayes, was paid thousands by the Clean Economy Development Center (CEDC) in D.C., for an unspecified role.

He was sworn in for an unprecedented fourth term as Oregon's governor on January 12. 

CEDC, which looks at U.S. policy on clean energy, paid Hayes $30,000 in 2011 and $88,000 in 2012 - a period when she was referring to herself as a clean energy adviser for the Democratic governor.

Hayes admitted in an email to the East Oregonian that she had been paid the money by CEDC. 

Daily Mail Online was awaiting a comment from CEDC on Friday.  

The paper also confirmed that she did not disclose $88,000 in tax filings for 2012 - claiming her income  was just over $27,000 from her own business venture, 3E Strategies.

The paper reported that since Kitzhaber was sworn in as governor in 2011, his fiancée has pulled in around $213,000 in consulting fees.    

According to her first lady biography on Oregon.gov, Hayes has 22 years of experience working in clean energy and has served as a member and co-chair of the Oregon Renewable Energy Working Group.

Her own consulting firm, 3E Strategies, had led to an ethics investigation, following complaints.

In November, the Oregon Government Ethics Commission opened a preliminary investigation into Hayes' consulting work.

The commission received three complaints about Hayes' work as a private consultant.  

The preliminary investigation was to determine whether the commission should proceed with a full-fledged inquiry that could lead to sanctions.

The commission also rejected Kitzhaber's request for an advisory opinion about whether ethics laws apply to Hayes, whom he first met in 2002.  

Officials said the questions asked by the governor's office will be addressed in the investigation.

Kitzhaber said Hayes carefully avoided conflicts of interest. Among those who filed ethics complaints were the Republican state party and a Republican state representative. 

A decision will be made on March 13 on whether a full investigation will take place.

This is not the first time that Hayes has brought unwelcome attention on the governor's office. 

In October, she admitted that she previously bought Washington farmland that was intended to be used to illegally grow marijuana.

She bought the $245,000 property at Colville Indian Reservation, Okanogan in 1997 with her then-boyfriend.

This came just months after she was paid $5,000 for a fake marriage to another man, an Ethiopian immigrant, in order to get him a green card.

Hayes admitted that she had been paid the money to marry immigrant Abraham Abraham. The couple filed for divorce in 2001.

Hayes admitted she never told the governor about the marriage. 

Kitzhaber confirmed he had known nothing about the marriage - or the farmland for marijuana.   

The marriage, her third, was uncovered when the Willamette Week newspaper began asking questions. She had previously claimed to have only been married twice.

Governor Kitzhaber met Hayes in 2002 and the couple became engaged last year. They live in the governor's opulent mansion
