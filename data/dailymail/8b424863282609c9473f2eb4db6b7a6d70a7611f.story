Concerns: Judge Alan Goldsack claimed the children of hardened criminals should be adopted at birth

Babies born to prostitutes, drug 
addicts and other criminals should be adopted at birth to prevent them 
 following their parents into jail, a  leading judge has said.

Alan Goldsack QC, the Recorder of 
Sheffield, said it was the state’s duty to intervene to stop the ‘next 
generation of criminals’.

He said it was ‘frightening’ how many 
of the criminals he was sentencing today were the grandchildren of those
 he had dealt with 40 years ago.

‘Crime runs in families the same way 
that being a doctor, teacher or lawyer does,’ he said in an interview to
 mark his retirement.

‘Some people become criminals because 
they enjoy crime and think it’s a good way of life and if they don’t get
 caught they think they can have a good lifestyle.

‘But a frightening thing is the number
 of people I see who are the grandchildren of the people I have 
prosecuted and defended 40 years ago.’

The state had to ‘remove young babies from the families that are going to produce the next generation of  criminals’, he said.

He added that a dysfunctional family 
would often have £250,000 spent on them, ‘but if we get in early and 
removed children we could save thousands’.

He said a ‘huge proportion’ of prisoners were a ‘product of the care system’.

He added: ‘The care system is not 
working as well as it should be by a long chalk. If you leave a child 
until they are nine or ten, you can’t do much for them at all.’

Children removed at 11 or 12 would ‘invariably end up in a children’s home’.

The 65 year-old judge made his remarks
 after 43 years in the legal profession. But children’s campaigners 
accused him of criminalising babies.

Critical: Camila Batmanghelidjh, founder of the charity Kids Company, said taking children from criminal families was not the right solution

Camila Batmanghelidjh, founder of Kids
 Company, said: ‘This protest is directed at the wrong corner of the 
problem.

'If you look at the baby in their cot, they are not a criminal. 
Taking babies from parents because they happen to be in criminal 
families is not the right solution.

'We need to address the way that we 
work with disturbed families and children.’

Alison Worsley of Barnardo’s said the Government needed to do more to support children of prisoners.
