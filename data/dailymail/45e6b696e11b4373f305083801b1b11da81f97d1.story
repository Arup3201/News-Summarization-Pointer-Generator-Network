Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho is keen on a reunion with Sami Khedira.

The Germany star was a key member of Mourinho’s squad during his reign as Real Madrid boss and now he wants Khedira to move to Stamford Bridge.

Khedira has turned down an offer of a new contract at Real and would want £150,000 a week to come to London.
