Neil Davey, 51, has lost his appeal against record £125,000 fine for felling a protected tree in his neighbour's garden in Parkstone, Dorset

A wealthy homeowner who felled a neighbour’s tree that was blocking sea views from his hot tub has lost an appeal against the record fine imposed on him.

Neil Davey arranged to have the protected 40ft maritime pine tree axed while he and his wife Sheena were on their honeymoon in Paris in 2010.

On their return, the 51-year-old surprised his bride with her wedding present - unobstructed views of Poole Harbour, Dorset, from their sun terrace.

The enhanced views increased the value of the Daveys' large detached home in Parkstone from £725,000 to £775,000.

At Bournemouth Crown Court last November, Davey was found guilty of arranging to have the 55-year-old tree felled and was ordered by a court to pay out £50,000 to make up the difference in his property's value.

He was also fined £75,000 fine, a record for the offence of destroying a protected tree, and ordered to pay court costs of £14,500.

Davey, who owns an auction house, launched an appeal but rather than quash his sentence, a Court of Appeal judge today upheld the earlier ruling, and ordered him to pay an extra £2,021 to cover costs.

Lord Justice Patrick Elias described Davey’s act as 'cynical', and said the substantial fine reflected the fact that the crime was one of the most serious of its kind.

Following the hearing Poole council’s planning enforcement officer, Andy Dearing, said: 'The council is pleased with the Court of Appeal’s decision upholding Davey’s conviction and fine.

'The fine, financial penalty and costs are a clear message to anyone contemplating such an act that the overall cost and reputational damage outweigh any gain, whether it is for a view or a planning advantage.'

Neighbour Steve Bransgrove said the noise of a revving chainsaw woke him up and he ran outside to see the felled tree

At his trial, Bournemouth Crown Court had heard Davey had 'paid or otherwise arranged' for friend Thomas McGuire, a tree surgeon, to take a chainsaw to the tree while he was away.

McGuire, 34, snuck into the garden under the cover of darkness and chopped down the 55-year-old tree.

Davey's neighbour Steve Bransgrove, on whose property the protected tree stood, was woken by the revving of a chainsaw in the early hours of June 20, 2010.

He raced outside to see that the perfectly healthy tree had crashed down close to a building, but McGuire had fled.

After the verdict in the court case last year, judge Peter Johnson told auction house owner Davey: 'This was a pre-meditated matter, not something that occurred on the spur of the moment.

'What you orchestrated demonstrated a remarkable arrogance.

'In order to improve your view you arranged for your co-accused to go around to the tree in the dead of night and cut it down, putting your neighbours’ lives at risk.'

McGuire was fined a total of £5,515 for his part in the scheme.

Davey had denied causing or permitting 
the destruction of a tree and McGuire, from Bournemouth, pleaded not 
guilty to the willful destruction of a tree.

Once the tree was felled, it offered a perfect view over Poole Harbour from Neil Davey's Parkstone home

Tree preservation orders (TPOs) exist to protect specific trees which bring a 'specific amenity benefit' to a local area.

They can be made to protect any type of tree, by the local planning authority, and they make it an offence to cut down, damage, top, lop or wilfully destroy the tree in question.

TPOs do not automatically cover any one species of tree, nor do they cover bushes, hedges or shrubs.

Owners of protected trees are still responsible for the tree, but the local authority's permission is usually needed if any work is to be done to the tree.

In recent years there have been spates of people damaging or cutting down protected trees to enhance the views from their properties.

Authorities in Poole, near Neil Davey's home in Parkstone, have reported several attacks on protected trees around the exclusive harbour area.

They investigated incidents including a 100-year-old protected oak having its top lopped off, and a resident pouring cleaning fluid onto another tree in an attempt to poison it.

But they said such incidents rarely ended in a prosecution because of a lack of hard evidence.
