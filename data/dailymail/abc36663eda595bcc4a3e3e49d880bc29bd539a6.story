They are well known for their shocking adverts with some of the world's most famous people posing naked to help boost their animal rights message.

But this time PETA may have gone too far with its latest campaign, which suggests those who swim or fish in waters containing sharks are attacked or killed as 'payback'.

The new poster shows a shark eating a severed human leg and the blood-stained slogan 'Payback is Hell', which aims to shock people into turning vegan.

Controversial: The PETA advertisement may upset many whose loved ones have been hurt or killed in shark attacks

PETA say that in particular they hope 
it will make people rethink fishing, suggesting if people inflict pain 
on sealife they deserve it themselves.

This could be considered particularly 
offensive as British man Michael Cohen was yesterday left fighting for 
his life after he was attacked by a great white shark while swimming in 
the sea near Cape Town, South Africa.

It could also be seen as an affront to
 the family of British honeymooner Ian Redmond who was attacked and 
killed as he went snorkelling yards off a Seychelles beach in August.

The newly married Mr Redmond, from 
Skelmersdale, Lancashire, had enjoyed a honeymoon lunch with his new 
wife Gemma before the couple headed to the Anse Lazio beach in the 
Seychelles.

But tragedy struck when Mr Redmond was attacked while swimming in relatively shallow waters around 20 yard from shore.

He lost an arm and suffered horrendous injuries to his left leg, as well as bite marks on his torso and hips.

Holidaymakers tried desperately to 
save him as he lay bleeding on the beach while others kept Mrs Redmond 
back to spare her the horror of his injuries.

Jeanne Vargiolu, 56, the owner of Le 
Chevalier restaurant on the beach, said Mrs Redmond was saying she 
‘still had hope’ for her husband as he lay on the beach.

‘I saw his wife talking to about five people, I think one was English, that she still had hope he was still alive,’ she said.

Speaking last month, 27-year-old 
primary school teacher Mrs Redmond, who during the drama refused to 
believe her husband was dead, paid tribute to Mr Redmond.

She spoke movingly of the man who had been her partner for nine years and husband for a mere ten days.

‘My husband and my best friend was 
tragically killed’ she said. ‘I loved him so much and he was a very 
special husband, a thoughtful son and a devoted brother.

‘He worked tirelessly to give us both a
 wonderful married life and home and I want to thank him for nine years 
of joy. We were having so much fun and we were so excited about our 
future together.

'Myself, our families and our friends 
are devastated and shocked by what has happened. The loss of Ian has 
left a gaping hole in our hearts that will never be filled.

‘He was always calm and collected, 
strong and brave, witty and intelligent, handsome and caring, a 
remarkable individual who will be deeply and sorely missed.'

In the South Africa attack on Tuesday 
43-year-old Mr Cohen was bitten 'numerous times' by a ten-foot-long 
shark, which ripped off the lower part of his right leg and part of his 
left foot.

Despite his injuries the man managed 
to drag himself onto the beach, from where he was rushed to hospital. He
 was yesterday in a critical condition.

The attack happened in the Cape Town 
suburb of Fish Hoek: an area that is notorious for sharks, especially at
 this time of year when they are known to be more numerous and more 
likely to attack.

Meanwhile last weekend, Charles 'CJ' 
Wickersham was spearfishing with friends in the Gulf of Mexico when a 
9ft bull shark bit him in the left leg.

It tore so hard that his thigh bone was exposed beneath a 15in gash.

PETA have wished the victim well, but say this is an example of the 'payback' the poster campaign highlights.

Mr Wickersham, 21, only survived because six of his friends dashed into the water and pulled him to safety.

Connor Bystrom, who was in the boat 
with Wickersham, told Good Morning America: 'All of a sudden he started 
screaming and we knew it wasn’t good.

'Within seconds there was just a pool of blood around him.'

PETA activist Ashely Byrne said: 'It 
may be an unusual way to get the message across, but I think it will 
cause people to be more sensitive towards fish.

'We are certainly glad the man is 
going to be alright, but we hope he and other fishermen will use this as
 an opportunity to rethink fishing.'

PETA wants the illustration placed on billboards and benches around Anna Maria.

But Mayor Michael Selby says that won't happen.

Mr Selby said: 'We have no billboards in the city, and we do not allow advertising on our trolley benches.'

One angler says this is PETA's 'typical propaganda.'

Shark angler Bill Goldschmitt said: 'If I see one of those billboards that they plan on putting up, I will burn it down.'

'This is a human we are talking 
about.  A lot of these animal rights activists look at the things being 
done to animals and don't seem to recognize what is being done to 
humans.'

PETA officials say this is not the first time they have tried to install signs after a shark attack on a human.

A group of surfers helped rescued what is believed to be a young great white 
shark over the weekend.

The baby shark washed ashore near the 
Venice Pier, a popular fishing spot, Saturday with a fish hook in its mouth.

Surfers in the area came to the shark's 
rescue, removing the hook from its mouth and dragging it back into the ocean. A 
bystander caught the rescue on tape.

It is unknown if the shark survived.

Scientists say the shores off the southern 
California coast are populated with young great white sharks who feed on area 
marine life.
