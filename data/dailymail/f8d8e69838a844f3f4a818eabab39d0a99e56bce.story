Black Friday gave Amazon its busiest day ever, with the online retailer saying it had 'surpassed all expectations'.

The website recorded orders for more than 5.5million goods, with around 64 items sold per second. It hopes to repeat its success tomorrow, Cyber Monday, with new offers every ten minutes.

Early indications show this weekend, which kicked off with chaotic scenes and flashes of violence in the early hours of Friday, is likely to be the biggest UK shopping weekend of all time.

Black Friday was Amazon's busiest day ever, taking orders for more than 5.5million items, an average of 64 every second

It was all hands at the pumps at an Amazon warehouse in Peterborough last week as workers prepared for what could be the busiest weekend in UK shopping history

Last year's Black Friday was also a record day for amazon.co.uk, when it sold more than four million items. 

It was surpassed on Cyber Monday 2013, when more than 4.1million items were ordered at a rate of 47 purchases a second.

Xavier Garambois, the vice-president of EU Retail at Amazon, said: 'This year really has surpassed all of our expectations. The public's appetite for Black Friday has been bigger than ever, kicking off the Christmas shopping period in earnest.

'Ever since we introduced Black Friday to the UK in 2010, sales have increased year on year but this year really has surpassed all of our expectations.' 

Jace TyrrelI, deputy chief executive of the New West End company - which represents hundreds of stores on Oxford, Bond and Regent Streets in central London - said he thought more than three million shoppers would visit shops in the area over the weekend.

He said: 'This is the busiest trading weekend of the year so far. Yesterday footfall on Oxford Street was up seven per cent on last year as the majority of promotions were high street brands. Today will be a big day as well because it's a full trading day - shops will be open until 10pm.

'Opening hours are restricted on Sunday, and Monday will be back to work for many.

More than three million shoppers are expected to visit shops around Oxford and Regent Streets in central London from Friday to Sunday

'We're set to make £220million across the West End for Friday, Saturday and Sunday - up between 5-10 per cent on last year.' 

Online retailers are braced for their busiest day of the year as consumers take part in the annual pre-Christmas shopping spree - Cyber Monday.

Recent years have seen online shopping figures consistently peaking on the first Monday in December, thought to be a combination of the last payday before Christmas falling on the previous Friday and a weekend spent browsing the shops before buying online.

Mr Tyrrell predicted that while shoppers would be returning to work on Monday, they would continue shopping online.

He said: 'John Lewis are having a very strong online trade. Smart retailers are maxing their online transactions.'
