A Sydney woman has managed to haul in a massive 143.7kg tuna worth roughly $4,000 - and it's big enough to feed an entire suburb.

Karen Wright, a mother of two, took the day off work  to go fishing south of Sydney on Wednesday when she reeled in the monster fish.

The tuna, which stands taller than Ms Wright, took 35 minutes to reel in and is now being assessed as a possible world record catch.

After posing for photos next to the giant tuna, Ms Wright cut it up and gave chunks to her friends.

Recreational anglers are not allowed to sell their catch so she missed out an a potential $4,000 she could have made by selling it.

'We knew the tuna were running so we took the day off work - they come down in certain currents and then they're gone in one, two, three days,' Ms Wright told the Daily Telegraph.

'Heaps of people came down, it was really exciting.'

Ms Wright, who is the president of the Sydney Game Fishing Club, said bluefin tuna had been running off Sydney all week, with several other anglers reeling in huge catches.

'The Sydney Game Fishing is pleased to announce that Karen Wright club president has just weighted the one of the largest Southern Bluefin tuna to ever be captured on rod and reel by a female angler on 15kg line,' the club said.
