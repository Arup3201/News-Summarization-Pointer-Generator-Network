A land, air and sea search was launched by police on Friday after a young surfer reported pulling up the body of a man while in the ocean.

The 16-year-old was surfing at Palm Beach at the Gold Coast in Queensland with friends at about 6.30am when he was thrown off his board and found himself tugging up a person's body as he surfaced.

'A 16-year-old boy was surfing with friends, he caught a wave and as he's come up and he's touched something which felt like hair,' A spokesperson for Queensland police told Daily Mail Australia.

The 16-year-old surfer told police he had fallen off his board and upon resurfacing, felt something in the water that felt like hair. Upon tugging up the object out of the water, he said he realised it was a man's body

'He then grabbed at the item and when he pulled up the item he saw the face of someone at which point he panicked, let go of the body and returned to shore.

'He later returned to the water with a friend to try and find the body but they couldn't locate it and contacted police around 8.30 this morning.'

Gold Coast Water Police Senior Sergeant Gavin Peachey told the Brisbane Times: 'That's what he [the surfer] believes - there's nothing to confirm that at the moment.'

Police immediately launched a search of the area using boats, jet skis and a helicopter; however they have received no reports of a missing person in the area.

Abandoned items of clothing were found on the beach, including a Maktec by Makita hat and a white Volcan t-shirt, however they have since been claimed by a member of the public and have been deemed unrelated to the incident.

Police responded by launching an land, air and sea search at Palm Beach (pictured) at the Gold Coast in Queensland on Friday, where investigations are still continuing

While the land and air search is continuing into Friday night, the water search has now been suspended.

'Police will reassess tomorrow morning if they will continue the search, they'll probably wait to see if they get reports of anyone missing. So far there are no reports to suggest someone is missing,' the spokesperson said.

A statement from Queensland police urged 'anyone who may know of any person who may not have returned home from a morning swim in the Palm Beach area to please make contact with police'.

The body was described as being a man in his 20's with dark hair.

Anyone with information which could assist with the matter should contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000 or visit crimestoppers.com.au.
