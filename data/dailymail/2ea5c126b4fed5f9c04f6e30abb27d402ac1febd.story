A Las Vegas billionaire is said to have given $5 million to an independent group backing Newt Gingrich, breathing new life into the former House Speaker's struggling presidential campaign.

Casino mogul Sheldon Adelson, who owns the famed Venetian Hotel and is the eighth richest man in America, is a long-timer backer of Mr Gingrich and his low-tax policies but his reported donation to the political action committee Winning Our Future has focused fresh attention on the independent groups.

Known as 'super PACs,' they can take in unlimited donation and unleash a barrage of negative advertising against opposing candidates. That was how frontrunner Mitt Romney's Restore Our Future PAC helped snuff out a late challenge by Mr Gingrich in Iowa.

A source told the Associated Press Mr 
Adelson is expected to contribute as much or more to groups backing the 
Republican nominee, be it Gingrich or one of his rivals.

Rick Tyler, a former top Gingrich strategist and spokesman for Winning Our Future, declined to comment on the donation, which was first reported by The Washington Post. Politico reported last month that Mr Adelson was allegedly prepared to spend $20 million to help Mr Gingrich.

Meanwhile, Mr Gingrich received a Palin endorsement Monday. Todd Palin told ABC News he respects the former House Speaker for his ability to mount a comeback last month after staffers quit his campaign en mass in the spring.

He said his wife Sarah, the former Republican vice presidential nominee, has not picked a candidate yet.

A 2010 Supreme Court decision easing restrictions on corporate and individual spending laid the groundwork for these political action committees, or super PACs, which can raise and spend unlimited amounts of money to influence elections as long as they do not coordinate directly with a candidate's campaign.

The identities of those who contributed to super PACs in the second half of 2011 won't be reported until the end of January.

Many donors' names will never be known. Some super PACs have established nonprofit arms that are permitted to shield contributors' identities as long as they spend no more than 50 percent of their money on electoral politics.

Crossroads, the giant conservative outfit tied to former George W. Bush political adviser Karl Rove, operates both a super PAC and a nonprofit.

Sheldon Adelson is a Las Vegas billionaire who has long been a supporter of Republican causes.

He founded and owns the Venetian Resort Hotel Casino and the Sands Expo and Convention Center.

Much of his wealth comes from the public offering of Las Vegas Sands Corp, the parent company that owns both businesses and other casinos in Macau and Singapore.

With an estimated net worth of $21.5 billion, Mr Adelson, 78, is the eighth richest man in America and the 16th richest in the world.

Mr Adelson was initially a Democrat but became a Republican later in life.

He was quoted in the New Yorker magazine as saying, 'Why is it fair that I should be paying a higher percentage of taxes than anyone else?'

In 2010, he gave $1 million to Newt Gingrich's super PAC, American Solutions for Winning the Future.Â 

A Jewish American, Mr Adelson has strong ties to Israel and owns Israel HaYom (Israel Today), the country's largest newspaper.

The Haaretz newspaper reports that he is a close ally of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

Crossroads and other Republican-leaning super PACs played a significant role in the 2010 midterm elections, helping deliver the House to the GOP and boost the number of Republicans in the Senate. The 2012 contest is the first to test the influence of such groups in presidential politics.

No candidate has seen his fortunes affected by the emergence of super PACs more than Mr Gingrich.

Riding high in polls just a month ago, he became the target of a $3 million advertising barrage sponsored by Restore Our Future, a super PAC supporting Mitt Romney run by several of the former Massachusetts governor's allies.

The ads, which pounded Mr Gingrich for his ties to federal housing giant Freddie Mac and his reversal on issues like climate change, sent his political fortunes plunging in Iowa. Mr Gingrich finished fourth in the state's caucuses last week.

Mr Gingrich has vowed to carry on and 
is hoping to resuscitate his campaign in South Carolina, which holds its
primary January 21. Since Romney is heavily favored to win the New 
Hampshire primary Tuesday, his rivals are looking to slow his momentum 
when the contest moves south.

Several
super PACs have already played a role in the Republican campaign. They 
include Make Us Great Again, a super PAC backing Texas Gov Rick Perry; 
Our Destiny, supporting former Utah Gov Jon Huntsman; and the Red White 
and Blue Fund, which helped revive Rick Santorum's campaign in Iowa and 
is running ads in South Carolina.

Priorities USA Action, a super PAC backing President Barack Obama's re-election campaign, has spent modestly during the Republican nominating contest and is expected to step up its role in the general election.

Newt Gingrich was once the front-runner in the race for the Republican presidential nomination. But, after a $3 million negative ad barrage in Iowa and media focus on his past and its baggage, he has fallen to third place.

In last week's caucuses, he captured just 13.3 percent of the vote and came in fourth.
