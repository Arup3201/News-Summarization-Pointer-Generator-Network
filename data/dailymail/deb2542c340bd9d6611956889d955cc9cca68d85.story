Streaking rapidly across the skies, it resembles a flying saucer from a sci-fi movie.

But this is no spacecraft piloted by aliens invading the Earth... it is the latest state-of-the-art drone being tested by the US Navy.

Sleek, silver and capable of travelling at subsonic speeds, the bat-winged X-47B is a £1billion test aircraft developed to help the US develop the next generation of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).

The X-47B taxies to its launch position on the flight deck aboard the nuclear powered aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt, off the coast of Virginia on Sunday

Instead of being piloted by remote control, the X-47B flies autonomously using state-of-the-art GPS navigation technology and flight control software.

Commanders will programme the drone’s on-board computer with a mission - for example, spying on or bombing a target - and it will follow these ‘orders’ to navigate to its destination unless a human ‘pilot’ on the ground steps in.

The X-47B drone is the first designed to operate an aircraft carrier. These extraordinary photographs were taken as it took off and touched down from the warship Theodore Roosevelt as it sailed in the ocean on Sunday.

Launching drones from carriers would mean the US did not need permission from other countries to use their bases.

A hook attached to the fuselage of the aircraft snags an arrestor cable on deck to bring it to a stop.

The jet fighter-sized machines, developed by defence company Northrop Grumman, weigh six tonnes and have a range of 2,100miles.

Senior US naval chiefs have described the ‘miraculous’ X-47B as a ‘glimpse of the future.’

The development could signal the end of Top Gun-style piloted air combat missions.

They will be able to provide round-the-clock surveillance, gather intelligence and carry out lethal missile attacks without putting personnel at risk.

The move to expand the UAV fleet comes amid growing criticism of America’s use Predator and Reaper drones against terrorists in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Yemen.

It is not yet clear whether the drone will be able to open fire without explicit authorisation from its controller. The Pentagon has vowed that no UAV would be able to decide when to attack humans.

But critics have warned the introduction of ‘artificial intelligence’ into military weapons systems is a step towards the development of autonomous ‘killer robots’.

The X-47B is expected to be in service by 2020.
