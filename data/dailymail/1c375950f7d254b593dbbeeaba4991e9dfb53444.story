The Cat B100 handset, pictured, has been designed to 'withstand the rigours of the real world'

Caterpillar is known for its rugged machinery - and now it has rolled out an equally rugged new phone said to be waterproof and drop proof.

The Cat B100 handset has been designed to ‘withstand the rigours of the real world'.

Its makers claim it can survive a 1.8metre drop as well as temperatures as low as -25°C.

It can also be submerged in up to one metre of water for up to 30 minutes, has a talk-time of up to 10 hours and can be on standby for up to 23 days using a single charge.

The handset has gone on show at the 2014 International Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas.

It was built to be used in noisy environments such as building sites because it has a noise cancelling microphone and a high-quality loudspeaker.

Unlike the latest generation of thin touchscreen smartphones, the Cat handset has large buttons so that people can use it while wearing gloves.

‘The Cat B100 is a practical and tough mobile phone, designed for people who demand ultimate reliability, said Dave Floyd, Co-CEO of Bullitt Mobile, which licenses CAT phones.

'Its rugged features, long battery life and talk time make the B100 an ideal choice for tough conditions.

‘This is a phone that won’t let you down,’ he added.

The Cat B100 can work in temperatures of between -25°C and 55°C as well as keep out dust.

The handset follows Cat’s B15 model, which is also built to stand knocks, scratches, water and dust, but does not have a physical keyboard.

While the B15 smartphone runs Android 4.1 Jelly Bean and has a 5MP camera, the newer B100 is a feature phone running a proprietary operating system and has a 3MP camera.

The new handset comes with a screen protector and belt clip, as well as a charger and will be available in Europe, yet pricing and availability has yet to be announced.
