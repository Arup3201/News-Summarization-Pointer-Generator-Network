Charged: Suicidal former business executive Robert Dellinger, pictured, slammed his pickup truck into an SUV on a North Hampshire highway Saturday, killing a pregnant woman and her fiance, a father-of-three

A suicidal former hotshot businessman slammed his pickup truck into an SUV on a North Hampshire highway on Saturday, killing a pregnant woman and her fiance, a father-of-three.

Robert Dellinger, 53, is charged with two counts of reckless manslaughter in connection with the horrific crash, which left 29-year-old Jason Timmons, 24-year-old Amanda Murphy and their unborn baby dead.

Prosecutors said Dellinger's truck crossed the median on Interstate 89, became airborne and sheared off the top of the couple's car, killing the pair, who met while working at an old person's home, instantly.

The medical examiner's report said the injuries they suffered were consistent with a plane crash.

Dellinger, of Sunapee, was arraigned by video Wednesday. He sat at a table and stared down for most of the proceeding.

His wife, sons and about a dozen other supporters left court without speaking to reporters.

Dellinger served as senior vice president and chief financial officer at Fortune 500 company PPG Industries Inc.

He took a severance package worth more than $1 million in cash plus stocks when he left in 2011 because of health reasons, according to documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Dellinger, who also held top-level posts at Sprint Corp., Delphi Corp. and General Electric Co., bought a home on Sunapee Lake in November 2012, according to property records.

Susan Morrell, senior assistant attorney general for New Hampshire, said Dellinger argued with his wife over his medications on the morning of the crash.

He left the house and began to drive around, growing increasingly despondent, she said. A trooper said Dellinger told him he intended to kill himself.

'He was driving around, depressed and loopy,' Morrell said. 'He saw the median and decided to turn into it.'

Morrell noted the portion of median Dellinger chose had no trees, rocks or other obstacles.

'He could have chosen many other ways to kill himself that would not put anyone else in danger,' she said.

Dellinger's lawyer, R. Peter Decato, called the state's comments 'over the top' and said Dellinger had led a 'productive and exemplary life.' He argued for low bail for Dellinger. A judge ordered Dellinger held on $250,000 cash bail, which his family were expected to post Wednesday.

Dellinger also will have to get a 
mental health evaluation, wear an electronic monitor, surrender his 
passport and driver's licenses and not drive a car.

Father: According to Valley News, Timmons, pictured, was a father of three children, including this cutie, already. This was Murphy's first child

Angry: Friends expressed their anger and devastation on Timmons' brother Ray Blanchard's page, claiming Dellinger should have been charged with three counts of manslaughter

He'll have to stay in New Hampshire despite a request by his lawyer to allow him to travel for mental health treatment in Kansas, where he has property.

Timmons and Murphy got engaged in March this year, according to Timmons' Facebook account.

They lived in Wilder, Vermont, and met while working at valley Terrace Assisted Living Facility.

Timmons has three children from another relationship, Faith, Aubrey and Gavin Timmons. He enjoyed the outdoors, especially fishing with his fiance, the Valley News reported.

Friends expressed their anger and devastation on Timmons' brother Ray Blanchard's page, claiming Dellinger should have been charged with three counts of manslaughter.

Blanchard's girlfriend wrote on his behalf on December 8: 'As some of you may already know we lost two amazing individuals that we were so blessed to be apart of their lives ..we also lost the chance to meet lil Raegan .. Jasons brother Ray is unable to respond but my kids and I will send him your thoughts if anyone would like to write to him please feel free I will give you his address.... RIP !!! Jason Timmons and Amanda Murphy .... We all love you so much !!'

Arraignment: Robert J. Dellinger, was is arraigned by video at Lebanon District Court in Lebanon, New Hampshire, on December 11, a few days after the crash

Amanda Murphy was very excited to be a mother for the first time, and the couple had already named their daughter Reagan Elizabeth.

Catherine Amarante, executive director at the care facility, where Murphy was lead caregiver said of the pair, 'He certainly was very, very loving, as was she. She really wanted to have this baby.'

She added to the New Hampshire Union Leader that the facility held a baby shower for Murphy last Wednesday and she was 'glowing.'

'So it's shocking. We're still in shock,' she said. 'We deal with death in elders, and that's hard in and of itself, but this is totally different.'

Amarante said Murphy was trustworthy, intuitive, and worked well with dementia patients. Timmons was 'a gentle giant.'

'Just a big tall guy and a really, really good caregiver and really loved by the patients and staff,' she said.
