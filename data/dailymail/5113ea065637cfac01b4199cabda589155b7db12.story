A Michigan mother charged with murdering and dismembering her son was captured on CCTV buying a circular saw.

The saw Donna Scrivo, 60, bought was found in one of the bags containing the remains of Ramsay Scrivo, 32, which were found strewn across rural parts of St Clair County.

Scrivo was charged Monday with the murder of her son after previously being charged with mutilating and illegally removing a body.

Serious charges: Following two previous charges, Donna Scrivo had now been charged with premeditated murder

According to the Detroit Free Press, Assistant 
Prosecutor William Cataldo said that Ramsay Scrivo was 'horrifically 
mutilated' with ligature marks on his neck and blunt-force trauma to his
 head and shoulders.

An autopsy showed he died of asphyxiation.

Gruesome purpose: Scrivo was captured on camera buying a circular saw that detectives believe she used to carve up her son

Cataldo said at a bond hearing earlier this month that Ramsay Scrivo's body had likely been placed in a bathtub and set on fire after it was mutilated.

Donna Scrivo was arraigned in the 40th District Court. No follow-up court date has been set.

She will undergo psychological evaluation to determine her competency to stand trial.

The remains of Ramsay Scrivo were discovered around 3pm on January 30 after a resident in China Township reported seeing bags on the side of the road.

Donna Scrivo had reported her son missing three days earlier on January 27. At the time, she told police that her son had left home the previous day and never came back.

Authorities eventually found bags containing Ramsay Scrivo's body dropped in four locations around China and St Clair Townships - about 50 miles northeast of Detroit.

Some of his remains were not in bags, and one bag contained clothes and charred paperwork.

Police are still searching for one more limb.

Surveillance footage shows that Donna Scrivo was in the area around the time the bags were reported.

Another witness reported seeing the woman carrying black plastic bags out of the condo in St Clair Shores she shared with her son.

Shocking: Neighbors were horrified to hear that Donna was charged for mutilating her son's body

Donna had been staying with her son ever since her home suffered fire damage in the fall and was being repaired.

A police search of the condo and Donna's SUV turned up blood stains belonging to Ramsay. There was also sign of bleach being used in the condo.

Police said they had contact with the mother and the son in the past over family trouble.

But news of Ramsay's death, and interest in Donna as the perpetrator, came as a shock to Doris Odren - Donna's next door neighbor of 18 years.

'I knew that she loved Ramsey a lot; she really did. She doted on him, you know, like all mothers do with their sons,' Mrs Odren told CBS Detroit. 'I just … can’t get my head around that. I can’t see her … I know her.'

Her husband Thomas Odren was just as surprised.

'It just seems so out of character,' Mr Odren told the Lansing State Journal.
 'That’s what makes this so hard to process. She had such a good 
relationship with Ramsay. I would never expect anyone to (dismember 
their child).'

'We’re anxious to figure out what happened.'

Donna
 was officially arrested on January 31. Ramsay's cause of death has not 
yet been released, as the medical examiner awaits a toxicology report.

Ramsay
 Scrivo graduated from De La Salle Collegiate High School in 1999 and 
went on to earn his accounting degree from Wayne State University.

He worked as an accountant for some time after graduation but quit when a surpervisor criticized his work.

Most recently, he was working as an All State Insurance agent in Roseville.

Guardian: Ramsay Scrivo (far right) had been under his mother's protection since last May, following his father's death

Since May, Donna Scrivo had been her son's guardian when he became despondent following his father Daniel's terminal illness.

On May 16, the day after his father died, Donna petitioned the court to hospitalize her son, and Ramsay consented.

Court documents obtained by the Detroit Free Press reveal that Ramsay's anger 'had escalated to unsafe levels' and that he 'threatened to commit suicide'.

He
 was also on probation for assault and his mother said he had been 
getting into a lot of fights lately because of 'poor judgement'.

She
 said he suffered from paranoia and depression and had been refusing to 
take his medications because he felt he didn't need it.

Ramsay had even threatened a family friend he believed poisoned him.

Looking: Donna Scrivo scanned the court room, but it didn't appear as though any family members turned up to support her

The court agreed that Ramsay was a danger to himself and placed him in his mother's care in May.

The
 following month, Ramsay told the court he planned to petition to end 
the guardianship in six months and would cooperate with treatment, take 
his medication and follow his mother's rules.

But that changed in September when he had a tooth crown removed because he thought someone had planted it there as a speaker.

Following that incident, Doctors diagnosed him with psychosis and said he was paranoid.

In
 court on Monday, Donna scanned the room as if she was looking for 
someone - though none of her family seemed to have attended.

She is currently being held on $100,000 bond and is due back in court on February 11.
