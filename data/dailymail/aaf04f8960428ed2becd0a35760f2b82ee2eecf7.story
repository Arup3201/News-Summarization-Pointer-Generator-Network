Tommy Wright pulled no punches last night as he admitted his sloppy Saints only had themselves to blame for this dispiriting home defeat.

Just seven days after rolling over the Swiss here in a dramatic penalty shoot-out, the Perth side’s Euro hopes was shattered by their Slovakian visitors in a disappointingly one-sided encounter.

The Scottish Cup winners now need a glory night of similar proportions to that victory over Luzern if they are to turn the tables in the return leg.

Skipper Dave Mackay gave them an outside chance courtesy of his injury-time strike, but Ivan Schranz was the two-goal hero for Spartak. His 34-minute opener was stunning but his second just after the hour mark was a gift after Scott Brown was punished for a wayward back pass.

A less-than-impressed Wright insisted the tie wasn’t over but said: ‘We’ve got to do a lot better to give ourselves a chance.

‘We can’t play for 15 minutes at the start of the second half and five to 10 minutes at the end and expect to beat teams who are technically very good.

‘We played into their hands because we didn’t perform in the first half. That was the most disappointing thing.

‘I can’t really blame Scott Brown because he attempts to play a pass at their second goal and it goes in a different direction.

‘We just gave away too much possession in bad areas and the decision making was poor. I wasn’t happy at half time because we didn’t even compete. That’s not like us. We didn’t win second balls and it was all too easy for them.

‘We were better at the start of the second half and Gary Miller has a great chance to make it 1-1. Then straight after that they get their second goal.’

Wright insisted Saints must show their real qualities next week to avoid spinning out of Europe.

‘We’ve still got a chance The tie is alive but we’ve got to play better. We’re not often out-worked our out-competed but that’s what happened and with the quality they have, they hurt us. The real St Johnstone have to turn up in the return leg.’

Without striker Stevie May, sidelined with a thigh injury, Saints struggled from the offset and, in truth, the damage could have been a lot worse had slick Spartak taken all of their chances.

It was hoped the return of Wright to the dug-out following the death of his mother would inspire the hosts.

But the visitors began more brightly and Saints had keeper Allan Mannus to thank for keeping them at bay.

With 12 minutes gone, skipper Marek Janecka’s pass released Schranz, and his driven shot was well saved by Mannus at his near post.

From the corner, Schranz rose tallest to meet Jan Vlasko’s dead-ball but his header was by tipped over this time.

Midway through the first-half, playmaker Vlasko went on another driving run which ended in his ambitious effort from 25 yards taking a deflection and going behind.

Saints suffered an unexpected blow when Chris Millar limped off to be replaced by substitute Gary McDonald. Things went from bad to worse when Spartak went ahead in some style just after half an hour.

Vlasko, who had been orchestrating play since kick-off, slid a perfect pass through to Schranz. He galloped free of a static Saints defence, before rifling an unstoppable left-foot finish from inside the penalty area beyond the reach of Mannus. It was no more than Spartak deserved for their enterprising efforts throughout the first-half.

Saints surely couldn’t be so poor after the break and, within minutes of the restart, they forced the visiting keeper into a save.

David Wotherspoon latched on to Michael O’Halloran’s through ball, only to see his effort held comfortably by Dobrivoj Rusov.

That gave the largely subdued home crowd a much-needed lift and their favourites ought to have equalised in 56 minutes.

Full-back Brian Easton sent over a tempting cross deep into the Slovakian penalty area which was met by the on-rushing Gary Miller. He failed to hold his nerve, however, and headed wide from 10 yards.

Saints’ brief resurgence came to an abrupt end in 63 minutes when Spartak went two in front.

Brown’s attempted pass-back was woefully short and Schranz seized upon a golden opportunity, rounding Mannus to roll the ball home.

Soon after, Spartak threatened to pile more misery on Wright’s men when Vlasko set up Erik Sabo, but he fired wide with just Mannus to beat.

The Perth side refused to give up and Mackay’s fine finish low into the corner from Wotherspoon’s cross gives them some hope.

Spartak boss Juraj Jarabek felt his players more than deserved their victory but refused to accept his team were home and dry

‘We scored two goals on the night and I believe there was a third goal just hanging there,’ he said. ‘But St Johnstone are a very good team and they will fight to the last minute so the tie is not over.’

Hard to take: The Saints will have to raise themselves again to have any chance in the second leg
