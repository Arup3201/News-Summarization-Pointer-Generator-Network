They introduced a fingerprint sensor for unlocking the iPhone 5s and now Apple has been granted the rights for an even more advanced means of security - the face.

The tech giant was yesterday awarded U.S. Patent No. 8,600,120, which is a 'personal computing device control using face detection and recognition'.

In addition to using face recognition for unlocking an iPhone, it could also be used for unlocking specific features on the phone,  according to AppleInsider.

For instance, an incoming call or text could only be unlocked by the person who is registered with the facial recognition security.

Interfacing: The future of Apple products looks to involve facial recognition in the security process of devices, such as unlocking phones, after the tech giant acquired a new patent on Tuesday

Apple on Tuesday was granted a patent - seen here - that uses facial recognition technology to control a computing device, like an iPhone, iPad or Mac, allowing for a more secure and productive operating environment

The patent's documents note that face detection and recognition are two different processes. Detection involves locating faces within an image, while recognition goes deeper by pairing those faces with a particular person or user

It joins another patent Apple landed two years ago for facial recognition technology, around the time some Android phones began letting users unlock their devices with their faces.

Samsung Galaxy devices already use facial recognition to unlock the phones.

While experts say the move is likely part of a plan for the iPhone 6, just like many other patents the company have acquired, the technology may never acutally be put into play.

Venture Beat reports the patent consists of three systems: A face detection application, which lets it distinguish faces from their surroundings; a face recognition application, which identifies individual faces; and an input/output application, which will let Appleâ€™s devices act on all the facial data.

The Xbox One and PlayStation 4 also utilize face recognition for easy logins.

Computers are expected to be the next device to actively use facial recognition.

If facial recognition systems were to be rolled out, all a device would need to operate it is a computer that faces the user

When it comes to computers, the patent says that so long as an image of the person using the device can be seen over a period of time, it could unlock features within the computer exclusive to that user

The technology just requires a camera facing the user, making it easy to implement.

Apple also recently completed its acquisition of 3D body sensing firm PrimeSense, an Israeli firm that helped create the original Microsoft Kinect's motion sensing capabilities

It has been rumored that Apple is working on a 4.8-inch edge-to-edge display with sapphire glass.

It has also been rumored that the next-generation iPhone will have 3D vision.

The next iPhone is expected to be released in spring 2014.
