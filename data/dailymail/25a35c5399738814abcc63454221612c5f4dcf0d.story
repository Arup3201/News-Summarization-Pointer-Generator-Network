A devoted couple celebrating their 70th wedding anniversary have revealed the secret to their long and happy marriage - regular arguments.

Robert and Betty Timms, 91 and 92 respectively, from Swindon, believe a good row helps clear the air and say they never 'run away' from their disagreements.

Clearly, the tactic has paid off as the couple have now reached their platinum wedding anniversary. 

Bob and Betty Timms married on October 14, 1944, at St Mark's Church in Swindon before a reception at the nearby Cross Keys Hotel

Bob's advice (pictured above with wife of 70 years, Betty): 'The most important thing is to talk to each other. If you talk to each other and listen to each other you can get through most things'

Robert  said: 'We sit across the table, and row about all our illnesses and ailments to each other, and when we get to the seventh one we start laughing and we forget all about what the row was over.'

He adds: 'The most important thing is to talk to each other. If you talk to each other and listen to each other you can get through most things.

'What you mustn't do is run away.'

Robert and Betty met before the outbreak of World War Two while working on the railways in their home town of Swindon, Wilts.

They married on October 14, 1944, at St Mark's Church in Swindon before a reception at the nearby Cross Keys Hotel.

Robert was called up to join the war effort in 1943 and enlisted with the Royal Engineers' bomb disposal unit in London.

After the war he returned to join the railways in Swindon and the couple went on to have three children.

Sadly, their two eldest two children, Jill and Robin, both lost their battles with cancer at the ages of 66 and 52 respectively.

The couple celebrated their anniversary with youngest son Andrew and their 20 grandchildren, great-grandchildren and great-great-grandchildren.
