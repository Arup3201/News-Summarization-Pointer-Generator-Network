Luis Suarez crouched on the Selhurst Park turf, shirt pulled taut over his head after a match which probably ended Liverpool’s title challenge and the chance of an ‘absolute dream come true’ for the Uruguayan.

Steven Gerrard coaxed his team-mate to his feet, waving away TV cameras honing in on his despair and Kolo Toure draped his arm around Suarez and ushered him off the pitch. These images may have prompted some mickey taking but they showed how much he is cared for by Liverpool.

This is a club that stuck by him when he was a pariah of football after being found guilty of racially abusing Patrice Evra and nibbling at Branislav Ivanovic’s arm. They have supported him completely and Brendan Rodgers has cajoled the best from the striker on the pitch.

But there is also the sense that Suarez has repaid the debt with his blistering form and goals this season and is now entitled to look for a new challenge, most likely at Real Madrid or Barcelona.

A 2-0 defeat by Chelsea at Anfield last week and the squandering of a 3-0 lead at Crystal Palace on Monday night will only fuel the speculation that one of the world’s best players could be heading for a club where he perhaps has more opportunity to establish himself as a great of the game.   

There were rumours that Suarez was heading to Spain even before Liverpool’s title challenge began to unravel.

Real Madrid president Florentino Perez is thought to have set his sights on luring Suarez from England to Spain just as he did with Gareth Bale last summer.

Suarez will have watched the Welshman excel at the Bernabeu and be rewarded with a Champions League final later this month and a battle against Barcelona and Atletico Madrid for the La Liga title.

Main man: Suarez has been in blistering form this season but could be a summer target for Real Madrid

Suarez signed a lucrative new deal in 
December to keep him at Liverpool until 2017 but if they were to sell 
this summer, the club could expect to triple the £22.8m it cost to bring
 him from Ajax in 2011.

Suarez,
 from Salto, in northwestern Uruguay, could be tempted by a return to a 
Spanish-speaking environment. Next month he will link up with his 
compatriots to prepare for the World Cup. Four members of the current 
Uruguay squad play in Spain - three for Atletico Madrid and one for 
Espanyol – and will no doubt extol the virtues of Spanish life and 
football.

Suarez claimed 
just last week that he was happy at Liverpool but the way the Premier 
League trophy has slipped from their grasp has clearly deeply affected 
the 27-year-old.

He 
recognises that this could be the best chance Liverpool have to win the 
title over the next few years against the financial might of Manchester 
City and Chelsea.

With his first half goal at Selhurst 
Park on Monday, Suarez equalled the 38-game league record of 31 goals 
held by Alan Shearer and Cristiano Ronaldo, despite missing the first 
five games of the season through suspension.

He
 is English football’s hottest property and his stock is the highest it 
ever has been. Suarez completed his remarkable turnaround by being named
 the Football Writers’ Association Player of the Year award this week.

The
 last three winners of the award have all left their clubs at the end of
 the season. Scott Parker exited West Ham to join London rivals Spurs in
 2011. Robin van Persie moved up to Manchester United after leaving 
Arsenal. Most recently Bale jetted off to Madrid from Tottenham.

The danger for Liverpool is that their star man’s head will be turned, just as soon as it reappears from under his shirt.
