Charged: Charnae Mosley, 27, pictured, allegedly left her children ¿ ages 6, 4, 2, and 1 ¿ inside the vehicle as she shopped for at least 16 minutes at a southwest Atlanta grocery store

An Atlanta mother-of-four has been charged with reckless conduct after she left all her children in a hot SUV while she went grocery shopping, police say.

Charnae Mosley, 27, allegedly left her children – ages 6, 4, 2, and 1 – inside the vehicle as she shopped for at least 16 minutes at a southwest Atlanta grocery store.

A passerby noticed the children in the car with the doors locked and the windows rolled up in the parking lot of a Kroger supermarket on Headland Drive about 3 p.m. Monday and called 911.

The mother returned from the store to find officers waiting for her by her vehicle.

The children were all safely removed from the vehicle and given water on the scene, authorities said.

None of them suffered any injuries.

'They were checked out by EMS and are OK, thankfully,' said Sgt. Gregory Lyons.

Video from the scene showed Mosley being driven away in the back of a police car, wiping sweat from her forehead.

She faces four counts of reckless conduct and was booked into the Fulton County Jail.

Officials with the Division of Family and Children Services were called to the scene, and the children were released to their grandmother.

Mosley's neighbor Lawanda Johns told WSBTV: 'I think there's no excuse. I do think there's different degrees and different situations, but when it's hot outside, I don't think it's appropriate.'
