A wealthy businessman arrested for murder after he stabbed a burglar to death during a knifepoint raid was spared the ordeal of reliving the tragedy in a courtroom today.

Homeowner Vincent Cooke, 39, had been detained after career criminal Raymond Jacob, 37, suffered multiple knife wounds as he broke in his luxury four bedroomed home in Bramhall, near Stockport, Greater Manchester.

During the raid, Jacob held a carving knife to the throat of a terrified Mr Cooke and frogmarched him upstairs in a search for jewellery.

But he was then overpowered by the victim and died following a struggle. Tests showed he suffered up to eight knife wounds.

Mr Cooke - who said he acted in lawful self defence - was questioned for 12 hours and later released without charge. But he was then kept on bail for almost a month until he was told he would not be charged.

Today Mr Cooke and his wife Karen were due to start giving a days of evidence against Jacob’s accomplice Michael Thorpe who was charged with aggravated burglary.

But Thorpe, 33 changed his plea to guilty meaning Mr Cooke will not need to give any evidence. Thorpe claimed Jacob was the prime mover in the attack.

The incident occurred when Mr Cooke, who had been at his £350,000 home watching TV, disturbed Jacob as he smashed his way into his house. He and Thorpe stole a ruck sack, three mobile phones, a sat nav and two computers.

Mr Cooke, who runs a same-day courier service, was taken upstairs at knifepoint to open the safe but a struggle broke out and Jacob was stabbed.

Mr Cooke dialled 999 himself but officers and paramedics were unable to revive Jacob and he was declared dead at the scene.

Thorpe escaped in a white Citroen van which was parked in a nearby street but was arrested later.

Mr Cooke’s wife Karen, 34, and 12-year-old son Anthony returned home during the incident but were unharmed.

Mr Cooke later told police that at the time of the raid he was in fear for his own safety and the safety of his wife and son. He later advised to leave the property after fears of reprisals from friends and associates of the dead man.

At Minshull Street Crown Court, Manchester, Thorpe of Outwood Road, Heald Green, Manchester was remanded in custody and told he would be sentenced at a later date.

Prosecutor Mark Kellet said: 'We accept the defendant was encouraged by Raymond Jacob. The defendant knew Ray Jacob had a knife but the knife was taken on the understanding to threaten not to injure.

'Michael Thorpe accepts his part in a joint enterprise to take a knife in to a home and threaten him in his own home and that Mr Cooke was targeted for a large amount of cash that he was told to be in Vincent Cooke’s possession.

'The defendant says that his role was secondary and the Crown says Jacob’s role was primary.

'The defendant was left upstairs and 
while there he heard a commotion between Jacob and Cooke and when he 
realised violence was involved, he didn’t want any part of it so ran 
from the premises.

'He was 
not part of the planning process. He was there to bolster the threats 
with a knife and stayed upstairs. He was the muscle not the planner or 
the instigator.'

Jacob had dozens of convictions for burglary, robbery and theft. He once served an 18-month prison sentence for beating a man unconscious and leaving him looking 'like a piece of meat'.

Police have since now installed CCTV cameras outside the Cooke house to watch out for thugs.

Prosecutors said he did what he 'honestly and instinctively believed was necessary on that day to protect himself, his home and his family from intruders'.

In a statement issued at the time he was vindicated Mr Cooke said: 'I hope to now be able to get on with my life but will never forget the day that I had to fight for my life.

'I just want to get my life back on track. I’m still very traumatised by what happened. I’m still having nightmares every night about this incident.'

Mr Cooke was the third man in Greater Manchester in as many months to be vindicated after stabbing an intruder to death in self defence.

Peter Flanagan, 59, who stabbed to death an intruder armed with a machete at his Salford home, was told the following month that he would not be charged with any offence.

Then Cecil Coley, 72, was told he would not face any charges after he stabbed an armed robber to death during a raid at his florists shop in Old Trafford, Manchester.
