Sarah Hunter, head of public policy at Google, has told MPs the company is not the 'bogeyman' of the internet in a bid to restore its damaged reputation

Google has told MPs it is not the 'bogeyman' of the internet in a bid to restore its damaged reputation.

The web search giant has come under fire recently after it was revealed it slashed more than £200million from its UK tax bill last year using an elaborate structure.

Despite making sales of £2.6billion, taxpayers were left to fund the shortfall after Google contributed just £6million to government coffers.

The American company also faces charges of unfairly skewing search results to boost its own services above those of rivals, and of failing to take tough enough action with websites that promote illegal content.

In addition Google
has been lambasted by child protection campaigners after its 
claims to have put effective safeguards on access to porn were called 
into question.

But Sarah 
Hunter, the company's UK policy chief, who was previously a senior 
policy adviser to Tony Blair, insisted yesterday that Google has been 
unfairly maligned.

She used a wide-ranging meeting with the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee to say: 'I  genuinely think we make a substantive contribution…We obey by all the laws in the country and other countries we operate in.

'It’s not the case that we’re the 
bogeyman [of the internet]. On the one hand we are seen as disruptive. 
On the other hand we are making [other companies] money.'

MPs were not pacified by her remarks, and described Google as 'public enemy number one'.

Jim Sheridan, Labour MP for Paisley and Renfrewshire, told The Daily Telegraph that Google’s stance on tax avoidance 
had angered 'honest, decent tax payers'.

He said: 'It reflects how NI was 
behaving on the phone hacking. It’s just arrogance. They [Google and NI]
are far too influential and powerful these days.'

It emerged recently that the internet giant avoided paying $2billion of tax worldwide.

The boss of Google sparked outrage last week as he said that he was ‘very proud’ of the elaborate structure that helped the search giant slash more than £200million from its UK tax bill last year.

MPs on the influential Public Accounts Committee last month slammed the group’s methods as ‘immoral’.

Google chairman Eric Schmidt said he was 'very proud' of the elaborate structure that helped the search giant slash more than £200million from its UK tax bill last year

But when asked about the arrangement which saw the group funnel billions of pounds to Bermuda, a renowned tax haven, the company’s chairman Eric Schmidt said: ‘It’s called capitalism.’

Mr Schmidt, who is estimated to be worth £4.6billion, said: ‘We pay lots of taxes; we pay them in the legally prescribed ways.

‘I am very proud of the structure that we set up. We did it based on the incentives that the governments offered us to operate.

‘It’s called capitalism.

‘We are proudly capitalistic. I’m not confused about this.’

Ms Hunter repeatedly told MPs it was 'way above my pay grade' to comment on Mr Schmidt's remarks.

She said that News International has been accused of illegal activity, unlike Google, which has been investing heavily in combating piracy, taking down illegal links and tweaking search results to ensure that pirate websites appear further down search rankings.

The news comes as the European Union set Google an ultimatum yesterday after it was accused of intentionally manipulating its search results to harm competitors.

The EU have given it a month to come up with detailed proposals to resolve a two-year investigation into complaints that it used its power to block rivals, including Microsoft.

The EU's antitrust chief, Joaquin Almunia, delivered the deadline in a meeting with Google Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt in Brussels.

If it fails to address the complaints, the world's most popular search engine could face a lengthy battle. If found guilty, it could mean a fine of up to 10 percent of its revenue, or $4 billion.

It emerged recently that the internet search giant avoided paying $2billion of tax worldwide

Almunia said in a statement: 'Since our preliminary talks with Google started in July, we have substantially reduced our differences regarding possible ways to address each of the four competition concerns expressed by the Commission.

'On the basis of the progress made, I now expect Google to come forward with a detailed commitment text in January 2013.'

Google has also come under fire recently for 'failing to stop easy access to porn' despite tweaking search results in the US to hide X-rated images.

The internet giant had changed its programming after earlier criticism so as to make X-rated pictures more difficult to find.

But a trial carried out in the US by the Daily Mail revealed that such images were still easily available.

Entering the word 'porn' in a search on Google brought up hundreds of X-rated pictures.

The result brought into question Google's claim that users in the US would have to be more specific if they wanted to view porn.

The changes had affected users in the US only. Those in the UK do not at present have the supposedly improved programming and there is no timetable to bring it in.
