A stag party in Las Vegas is usually the cue to go a little crazy. But the groom, my mate Justin Jacob, was adamant he didn't want 'crazy'. 

On this trip, we were determined to do things differently. After all, we are all older and wiser now…

Vegas wasn't the first choice among our party - we had originally planned to go to Thailand. There were going to be just five of us, so we thought we would head somewhere with some nightlife and a good spa so that we could relax too.

The famous Las Vegas casinos are definitely worth a punt if you're feeling flush

But then the number who wanted to travel grew to ten, so Justin suddenly announced: 'We're going to Vegas. I don't care if it's been done before – we're going to go and do our best out there.'

As Justin's best man, it was my job to organise the stag party - and I discovered what a nightmare that can be. First of all, it was impossible to get everyone to pay the money at the right time. 

And then those who had said they were coming suddenly decided that they couldn't make it, and people who had said 'no' then announced they were available.

We planned a three-night trip. Going on past experience, I knew it would be intense - nobody gets much sleep because there is always something going on. You plan to go to bed, for example, and then you get sucked into going to a pool party.

We stayed at The Cosmopolitan, one of the newer hotels in Vegas. It's vast - just walking from one end to the other takes about half an hour. 

It has great shops and 14 different restaurants, including STK, a steakhouse which also has branches in New York and LA.

Like most of the hotels in Vegas, The Cosmopolitan is very skilfully laid out so that it doesn't matter where you are going to or coming from, at some point on your journey through the hotel you will find yourself passing the slot machines and the gaming tables.

When you get to your room at the end of the day, you're unlikely to have any change in your pockets - it will all have been eaten by the 'slots'.

I'm not really a gambler, so I think I probably came home with a little bit more in my pocket than the others.

I had to be the sensible one, after all, because I saw it as my duty to look after the groom. You're there to make sure he's having a great time - within the limits, of course.

We didn't start off with a carefully drafted plan about how we spend our days in Vegas - instead, we decided that we would all meet up at certain points. We would all get together at dinner, for example, and then we would all head out to a club afterwards.

It wasn't that difficult to arrange. We had three rooms between us, so it was usually just a case of picking up the phone and saying: 'Right, we're meeting in 15 minutes.'

We looked at going on a Grand Canyon tour, but in the end we never really escaped the hotel scene – Vegas really sucked us in, chewed us up and spat us out!

Half the time you're not sure whether it's breakfast or whether you should be getting ready for a night out

While we had planned to take it easy, in the end we partied like we did when we were in our 20s.

The problem is that when you're down in the gaming rooms, there is no natural light, so you have no idea whether it's night or day. Half the time you're not sure whether it's breakfast or whether you should be getting ready for a night out.

But we all agreed the trip was a huge success. We didn't get much sleep but we had plenty of fun. And on a stag trip, that's all you can ask for.
