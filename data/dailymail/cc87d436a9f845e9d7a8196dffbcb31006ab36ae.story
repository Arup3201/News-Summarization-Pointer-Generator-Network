Newly released cellphone video shows the moment a 6-foot 250-pound man on a rampage was shot dead by police officers when Tasers failed to subdue him.

Delray Beach resident Robert Friskney was trying to get into his neighborhood Tuesday night when he saw the entrance blocked off by police who were trying to calm 28-year-old Anesson Joseph.

He says Joseph was acting like an animal, even growling, before he lunged at police officers and they shot him with a Taser.

Killed: New cellphone video shows police shooting dead Anesson Joseph who attack two men and a 10-year-old boy while stark naked and seemingly high on drugs

Bit and run: Authorities in South Florida say deputies shot a naked man after he attacked a retired police officer and bit another man on the face in Delray Beach

Sheriff's deputies said Joseph appeared to be in a 'state of psychosis' and he continued fight so they had no choice but to shoot him.

Identified: The assailant has been identified as 28-year-old Anesson Joseph of West Palm Beach

Paramedics tried to treat Joseph at the scene but he continued to resist.

He was eventually taken to Delway Medical Center where he was pronounced dead.

Prior to the shooting, Joseph had been terrorizing the suburban neighborhood, carrying out random street attacks on two men and a 10-year-old boy. 

Retired New York police officer Douglas Kozlik, 66, was out on his nightly walk when Joseph came out of nowhere and started chasing him.

Kozlik was left badly bruised to the face with scratches on his head but was out of the hospital the next day.

Joseph also injured a 10-year-old and 18-year-old Tony Grein.

Grein had a box cutter on him and tried to defend himself with the sharp object, but it was no use on the large man who seemed to have 'superhuman strength' according to Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw.

Joseph ended up trying to bite off Grein's face. Grein has several bruises and cuts to his face as well as stitches in his ears after the attack, which the victim showed to WPTV.

'He's obviously delirious on something,' Sheriff Bradshaw said.

When police got involved they tried to corner Joseph but he wouldn't calm down and they say he took a 'fighting stance'

That's when a sergeant fired three times, once to the torso and twice on the lower part of the body.

Authorities say it wasn't clear whether it was the gunshots or drugs that ultimately killed him.

Deputies believe Joseph was on some sort of narcotic.

According to Facebook, he is the CEO of Nightlife University Parites & Events.

At some point he started fighting an 18-year-old, who defended himself with a box cutter.

The man then bit the 18-year-old on the face.

'He's
 obviously delirious on something,' Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric 
Bradshaw said. 'He is a huge guy. He takes a fighting stance. They're 
trying to get him on the ground. He starts charging them. The Taser did 
not affect him.'

A deluge of police cars arrived, and deputies shot the assailant with a Taser but it didn't faze him.

'The
 man then charged our deputy, and he discharged his firearm,' the 
spokesperson tells New Times. 'But he was not incapacitated. He was then
 Tased, but that also had no effect.'
