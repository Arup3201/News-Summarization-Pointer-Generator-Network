Clooney once famously declared he could never run for public office because he’d ‘slept with too many women, done too many drugs and been to too many parties’.

He has often played politicians in his career - including the character of Governor Mike Morris in 2011 film The Ides of March.

'George is hugely popular with the Democrats and where better a place to put him than as the Governor of California the home of Hollywood,' a friend told the Sunday Mirror.

'It has always been a huge stronghold for the party and one that has a proven record for getting politicians in to the Oval office

'Now that Amal is by his side it has boosted his credentials even higher.

'She is as far removed as some of the girls he has previously dated and possesses incredible intelligence that bodes well if she ever does become First Lady.'

It was confirmed that the couple were engaged earlier this month following an eight-month romance and are said to be hoping to host their upcoming nuptials in the Italian city in September, exactly one year to the day after they met.

Ronald Reagan was voted in to the White House after becoming governor of the Golden State and if Clooney 
was successful in gaining victory in California it would put him on 
course to follow his lead.

Amal, a human rights lawyer who is also a special envoy for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, would become the only British First Lady in history if Clooney eventually won the 2020 race for the Presidency.

Clooney was the President’s guest for a screening of his latest movie, The Monuments Men, at the White House. where he was accompanied by his fiancee.

In April Clooneys confessed to calling Las Vegas gambling mogul Steve Wynn an 
'a**hole' and storming off at a dinner because the casino-owner 
insulted President Barack Obama.

The
 verbal assault occurred when the two-time Oscar winner 
was in Vegas promoting his Casamigos tequila, and was invited to dine 
with Wynn and his wife, Andrea Hissom, at the fancy Botero restaurant 
inside the 72-year-old's Encore hotel.

But when dinner was finished, the conversation turned to Obama's Affordable Care Act, of which Wynn is a vocal opponent.

Clooney immediately took exception to how the billionaire chairman and CEO spoke of his 'longtime friend.'

He allegedly declared that he didn't have to listen to 'this f***ing stuff' before exiting to another bar.

In May 2012 Clooney proved his loyalty to Obama by hosting a £15million fundraiser for the re-election cause - on his personal basketball court.

Guests (mostly movie stars) paid a whopping £25,000 ($40,000) each for a place at the 14 hallowed tables, and gave the president a rapturous welcome.

President Obama has previously said Clooney is a good friend who is sensitive about protecting that relationship.

Discussing their friendship in an interview with Entertainment Tonight, Obama said Clooney is low-maintenance and keeps his distance so that Obama won't be criticised for hanging out with Hollywood celebrities.

First Lady Michelle said of Clooney: 'He's cute, too' and joked that there was a 'conspiracy' to prevent her from spending too much time with Clooney.

She said that whenever the star meets her husband it is always when she is away.

Mr Obama said that whenever 'Gorgeous George' visits the White House his staff 'mysteriously' congregate around his office.

He added: 'I will say that the couple of times he's come to the White House, I notice that the staff suddenly is circling around my office. They've got memos they need to make sure I see right away.'

The President said the pair became friends after Clooney discussed with him his support of the oppressed people of Darfur and Sudan.

'And so when I was a senator -- this was well before I was president -- that was an issue that I was working together on a bipartisan basis, and George, who had traveled there, done documentaries there, and was very well-informed, came to testify in Congress,' Mr Obama added.

'And so we got to know each other, and he is a good man, and a good friend.

In May 2012 he was arrested and taken away in handcuffs at a protest outside the Sudanese Embassy in Washington.

Mr Clooney, his 78-year-old father Nick and a number of other protesters had been given three verbal warnings by police not to cross a police line outside the embassy before being taken into custody.

He was released after paying a $100 fine having just spent a few hours in custody.

The actor said at the time: 'It's actually a humiliating thing to be arrested no matter what you do, but I'm glad to be standing here with my father.'

The protestors were accusing Sudan's president, Omar al-Bashir, of provoking a humanitarian crisis and blocking food and aid from entering the Nuba Mountains in the county's border region with South Sudan.

Clooney, whose father was a political journalist, has described himself as a liberal.

He told CNN journalist Larry King: 'I'm a liberal. I'm confused when that became a bad word.

'I think what happened over a period of time probably in the late 1980s when it became sort of a political tool.

'The liberal movement morally, you know, has stood on the right side of an awful lot of issues.

'We
 thought that blacks should be allowed to sit at the front of the bus 
and women should be able to vote, McCarthy was wrong, Vietnam was a 
mistake.'
