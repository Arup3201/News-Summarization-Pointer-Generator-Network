Not giving in: House Speaker John Boehner said that he feels the Republicans have done enough to help try to avoid the cuts and it not willing to concede to all of President Obama's requests

America is just hours from crippling spending cuts as Washington heads into the dreaded sequester at the stroke of midnight on Friday.

The law simply says that 'on March 1, 2013, the president shall order a sequestration for fiscal year 2013.'

That means that at any point in the day on Friday, President Obama can issue the beginning of the sequestration where all facets of government will be forced to cut a collective $85billion between that point and October 1.

White House press secretary Jay Carney says that means midnight, Friday - or as close to midnight as possible- 11.59 p.m. and 59 seconds- because, Carney says, Obama is 'ever hopeful.'

After failed attempts at reaching a compromise in order to avoid the $85billion in budget cuts that will go into effect on Friday, President Barack Obama and Republicans blamed each other for the latest outbreak of gridlock.

The immediate impact of the reductions on the public was uncertain, and the administration pulled back on its earlier warnings of long lines developing quickly at airports and teacher layoffs affecting classrooms.

'(Republicans) voted to let the entire burden of deficit reduction fall squarely on the middle class,' President Obama wrote in a statement in response to the inaction

On the Senate floor, a Republican 
proposal requiring Obama to propose alternative cuts that would cause 
less disruption in essential government services fell to overwhelming 
Democratic opposition, 62-38.

Moments later, a Democratic 
alternative to spread the cuts over a decade and replace half with 
higher taxes on millionaires and corporations won a bare majority, 
51-49, but that was well shy of the 60 needed to advance. Republicans 
opposed it without exception.

In a written statement after the votes, Obama lambasted Republicans.

'They voted to let the entire burden of deficit reduction fall squarely on the middle class,' he said.

He
noted that he would meet with congressional leaders from both parties 
at the White House on Friday, but no one is expecting action before the 
cuts begin taking effect.

The full brunt of the automatic cuts will be borne over seven months and Congress can stop them at any time if the two parties agree on how to do so.

That makes it difficult to say how the belt tightening will hit ordinary Americans. President Barack Obama's administration is warning that Navy ships could lie idle and children would lose out on vaccinations if the cuts are not halted.

'Obama and Senate Democrats are demanding more tax hikes to fuel more "stimulus" spending,' House Speaker John Boehner said

Put into law in 2011 as part of a bipartisan solution to an earlier fiscal emergency, sequestration is unloved by both parties because of the economic pain it will cause.

Few believed two years ago that the cuts would come into force but, unable to agree on any other way to reduce the budget deficit, political leaders are pointing fingers at each other now that the spending reductions appear inevitable.

'It is the president's sequester. It was his team that insisted upon it,' Republican House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner said.

White House spokesman Jay Carney said Republicans' refusal to compromise by agreeing to close tax loopholes on the wealthy was one reason why the cuts might be unavoidable.

'Compromise represents willingness to accept policies that aren't 100 percent of what you want. The president has done that again and again. Unfortunately, Republicans seem to be unwilling to do that when it comes to the sequester, so the sequester may take place,' he told reporters.

Obama wants to end tax breaks for oil and gas companies and the lower 'carried interest' tax rate enjoyed by hedge funds.

Pink slips: Thousands are expected to be put on unpaid leave (furloughs) but Democrats are now painting the pink slips as coming from the desk of the Republicans

Carney said both sides had agreed to the 
spending cuts, half of which will come from the defense budget and half 
from non-defense domestic programs.

'It was designed as policy that would never come into effect. Because it was so onerous for both sides, it would compel Congress to reach a compromise,' Carney said.

The cuts total $85billion through the end of the current budget year - September 30 - half each from defense and non-defense programs. Large parts of the budget are off-limits, including programs for veterans, Social Security and Medicare benefits.

Though furloughs are a fear for some- especially certain federal workers- there is little sign of business worry, let alone panic in the nation. Stocks declined slightly for the day after trading near record highs.

Unlike the 'fiscal cliff' showdown of two months ago, there are no deadlines for action to prevent tax increases from hitting nearly every American.

Over the past two years, Obama and congressional Republicans have agreed to more than $3.6trillion in long-term deficit savings over a decade.

None of the savings to date has come from the big benefit programs that lawmakers in both parties say must be tackled if the country is to gain control over its finances.

Each party fears the political fallout of confronting them on their own, but Democrats, in particular, are reluctant to scale back programs that they count as their political birthright.

While the White House has issued a steady stream of severe warnings about the impact of across-the-board cuts, the president said Wednesday night, 'This is not a cliff, but it is a tumble downward. It's conceivable that in the first week, the first two weeks, the first three weeks, the first month ... a lot of people may not notice the full impact of the sequester.'
