Throughout their long married life together, Arthur Tear and his beloved wife Mary were inseparable.

When Mrs Tear began to suffer from the worsening effects of dementia, her devoted husband, a retired GP, continued to care for her at home into their late 80s.

But on Monday, just days short of their 66th wedding anniversary, the bodies of the elderly couple were discovered at their house in Millport, on the island of Great Cumbrae in the Firth of Clyde.

Loving couple: Dr Arthur Tear and his wife Mary's bodies were discovered at their home, just days before their 66th wedding anniversary. The couple were described as 'inseparable' by their children

Inquiries into the incident are ongoing but it is understood that police are not looking for anyone else in connection with the deaths.

Last night, the couple’s children paid tribute to their parents’ enduring love for each other. In a statement, they said: ‘We are very sad at the loss of our mother and father. They were a devoted couple, inseparable since they married over 60 years ago. We will miss them terribly.

‘We would like to thank everyone for their words of comfort. It is reassuring to know how well thought of our parents were – however, we would be grateful if we were left to grieve as a family.’

As detectives and police forensic scientists remained at the large stone property in the town’s West Bay area for most of the day, residents expressed their shock and sadness at the tragedy.

Neighbour Janice Campbell, 51, said Dr Tear, 89, always stopped to say hello and used to make her pots of jam.

She said: ‘The last time I saw Arthur was last week – he was outside doing the pointing on his wall in the front garden. He made me a pot of jam about a month ago because my husband had cut his grass.

‘I saw an ambulance arriving outside their house about 11.30 on Monday morning. At first I thought Mary had maybe taken a turn.

‘Almost every day you would see Arthur out with her, taking her a walk along the sea front. He kept it a regular thing, as a routine, which is obviously important for someone with an illness like hers.

‘I never heard them argue or losing their temper with each other. It must have been really hard for him. Their daughter would take Mary out to the shops in Largs.’

Dr Tear, born in Denbeath, Fife, married his wife in 1948 in Rutherglen, Lanarkshire, near her home town of Cambuslang. They went on to have four children – Mhairi, Marjorie and twin boys Alastair and Hamish.

It is understood Dr Tear first came to work as a locum for the Cumbrae Medical Practice before later settling on the island for good. He and his wife moved to Millport in the 1980s and stayed in the same house after Dr Tear retired around 1986. A few years ago, they had to deal with the heartbreak of losing their eldest daughter Mhairi and, in October 2012, Dr Tear arranged for a commemorative window plaque to be installed in her memory at Millport’s historic Garrison House.

None of the couple’s family lives on the island. Their son Alastair – a company director with a Glasgow-based shipping firm – lives in Newton Mearns, near Glasgow, and his twin brother, Hamish, works as a professional photographer in Wyoming in the US.

The couple’s surviving daughter, Marjorie, now lives in Jersey with her family. Residents in Millport said she often visited and would take her mother out for trips. It is believed Mrs Tear, 88, was suffering from a form of dementia that had worsened rapidly over the space of 18 months.

She would go to Marina’s Hairdressers every six weeks, often brought in by her daughter. The owner noticed a deterioration in Mrs Tear’s health.

She said: ‘I came into the shop just over a week ago and Mrs Tear was getting her hair cut. She didn’t want to engage in any conversation. And in her appointments before that she’d get quite mixed up.

‘Dr Tear always made sure she was wrapped up when they went out for a walk. I remember Dr Tear when he worked as a doctor when I was a wee girl. He worked as a GP on the island for at least 40 years.’
