Drivers are set to face a financial squeeze over the coming weeks, as the price of petrol will rise while the economy continues to struggle.

George Osborne attempted to ease the pain in last week's Budget by cancelling a proposed 3p increase in fuel duty, but the move appears to have had little effect.

The average petrol price has risen by 5.5 per cent in just two months, with a 4p rise in February, meaning that in some parts of Britain it costs £100 to fill up the family car.

Pain at the pumps: The cost of petrol has risen by 4p a litre over the past month alone

The price hike has been attributed to 
high global oil prices as well as the fall in the value of the pound, 
which makes imports more expensive.

But research from Santander Cards suggests that no respite is on the horizon, with the cost of fuel set to rise again in the short term.

The average price of a litre of petrol nationwide is currently 137.95p, with a litre of diesel costing 129.9p on average.

According to Santander, that means a motorist who drives 1,000 miles a month in a car going 35 miles per gallon must spend £180 per month on transport.

'With the cost of fuel expected to 
reach its highest level in the coming weeks, families and car commuters 
are likely to be the hardest hit once again,' said Alan Mathewson, chief
executive of Santander Cards.

'Aside
from mortgage costs, households in the UK already spend more on 
transport than any other living cost. Further hikes may well push many 
family budgets over the edge.

'There
are a number of small changes people can make to reduce these costs, 
such as car-pooling with colleagues, driving more economically or using 
public transport.'

The 
price of petrol usually rises as the weather gets warmer, suggesting 
that motorists will not be given a financial reprieve any time soon.

Breakdown: Sharp rises in fuel prices are caused by increases in tax and not price-fixing by oil companies

Mr Osborne has repeatedly tried to spare drivers from the Government's austerity programme by freezing fuel duty.

However, even though two thirds of the price of petrol is made up of tax, the Chancellor has been unable to do anything to combat the global economic factors which have been relentlessly pushing up motorists' costs.

Campaigners are calling for a cut in duty to help stimulate the economy.

A spokesman for FairFuelUK told the Daily Express: 'Despite the positive Budget news that the September rise in fuel duty is cancelled, petrol and diesel prices are still outrageously high.

'The UK economy needs a substantial cut in fuel duty in order to stimulate growth.'
