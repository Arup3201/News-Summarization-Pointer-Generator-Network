London could soon become a popular destination for large cruise ships if plans for a new passenger terminal in Greenwich move forward.

It is hoped that the mooring at Enderby Wharf would open in 2017 and become the capital’s first new terminal since the closure of the Royal Docks in 1981.

The hub would allow ships up to 820ft long to stop near popular tourist attractions such as the Old Royal Naval College and Cutty Sark, The Times reported.

New plans from Westcourt Real Estate are to be submitted to Greenwich council within weeks and show that the mooring would be used for the start and finish of cruises, the newspaper reported.

Westcourt has not revealed the cost of the new terminal, and lead architect Jonathan Manser said a previous design failed to meet the requirements.

He told The Times: ‘In particular we have increased the size of the terminal building to accommodate baggage handling for passengers embarking and disembarking and to improve the overall experience within the terminal.

‘We have altered the access for vessel servicing, as longer stays mean that the cruise ships will need to load and unload stores and provisions.’ A terminal that can accommodate large ships would provide a boost for tourism by bringing more cruise options closer to London and delivering thousands of visitors to the city every year.

According to The Times, vessels expected to use the terminal include Silversea’s 36,000-ton Silver Spirit, which is 682ft long and can accommodate 540 passengers and 376 crew.

But Londoners should not expect to see some of the world’s largest ships because the Thames is not deep enough to accommodate them.

Cruise ships of up to 682ft in length currently dock at Greenwich Ship Tier, a floating terminal where passengers have to board and disembark using a launch.

Ships up to 518ft can moor alongside HMS Belfast after sailing past Tower Bridge’s raised bascules.

Earlier this month, authorities in Venice, Italy overturned a ban on giant cruise ships passing through the centre of the canal city.

The ban imposed last November applied to cruise ships of more than 96,000 gross tons and limited the number of ships of 40,000 tons or more to five per day.
