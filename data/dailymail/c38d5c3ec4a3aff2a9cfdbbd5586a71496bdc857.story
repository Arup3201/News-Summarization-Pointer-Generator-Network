The vintage slogan 'Do you love anyone enough to give them your last Rolo?' has been voted the most romantic ad of all time.

Manufacturer Nestle axed the slogan in 2003 saying it was too sentimental, but its popularity has lingered long enough for ad buffs to vote it their favourite.

John Lewis just missed the top spot with its Christmas 2012 ad about a snowman on a mission to find the perfect present featuring the tagline 'Give a little more love this Christmas.'

My last rolo: The classic advert which featured a cartoon woman giving her last chocolate to a man she was in love with was voted the most romantic of all time

Google's 2009  ad took third place with its story told through search terms such as 'impress a French girl', 'long-distance relationship advice', 'churches in Paris' and 'how to assemble a crib'.

Marketing editor Rachel Barnes said: 'Rolo's slogan is so ingrained in the public psyche that you could ask someone on the street today and they would find it just as current as it was in the 1990s.

'It works so well as it rings true - it's hard to give away your last bit of chocolate, but you'll do anything for the special person in your life.

John Lewis's 2012 snowman campaign beaten into second, but expert says it does not have 'staying power' of some of the classic campaigns such as Milk Tray man

She added: 'John Lewis' ad tells a tale of classic romance, but I'm not convinced this one goes down in history among the most romantic ads of all time.

'The retailer's high share of the vote is no doubt because all their advertising is just so brilliant right now. In 10 years' time, I don't think people will recall the snowman in the same way they fondly remember "your last Rolo".'
