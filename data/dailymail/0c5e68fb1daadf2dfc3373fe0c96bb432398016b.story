Tony Blair has used secret talks to urge Michael Gove to face down opposition to his radical education reforms.

The former Labour Prime Minister has held at least two meetings in recent months with the Conservative Education Secretary urging him to press ahead in the face of criticism, including from the Labour party.

The private support from such a surprising quarter has emboldened the Tory minister to go further in his plans to overhaul the English education system. Mr Blair has also privately dismissed Ed Miliband's current education strategy as 'bunkum'.

The disclosure of an alliance between the two men is likely to provoke deep unease in today’s Labour party, which has sought to turn Mr Gove into public enemy number one.

While Mr Gove has previously confessed to being a Blairite, it will prove highly controversial for Mr Miliband that his predecessor is offering advice to the Tories.

To add to the division Mr Blair has previously dismissed Labour’s current education policy of ‘standards not structures’ as empty rhetoric which failed to deliver results when he was in power.

Mr Blair is known to be an ardent supporter of Mr Gove’s academies programme, freeing schools from local authority control.

Bunkum: Labour's shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt has said his policy is focused on 'standards not structures' - something Mr Blair has dismissed as pointless rhetoric

He has also hailed free schools as a 
‘great idea’ and accused the teaching unions of standing against 
‘necessary educational change’.

By contrast Tristram Hunt, the current shadow education secretary in Mr Miliband’s team, has condemned much of what Mr Gove is doing.

Last week in a Commons debate Mr Hunt insisted: ‘The first plank in Labour’s schools policy is to focus on standards and not structures.

‘We do not think that the job is done simply because a school has changed its name to that of an academy or a free school.

‘We think that the most important relationship is between a teacher and a pupil, and we would therefore ensure that all teachers in state-funded schools were qualified or working towards qualified teacher status.’

But Mr Blair has already rubbished the ‘standards not structures’ mantra as a good soundbite which ignores the need for better structures to improve standards.

Writing in his 2010 autobiography A Journey, Mr Blair wrote: ‘We had come to power in 1997 saying it was “standards not structures” that mattered.

‘This was fine as a piece of rhetoric; and positively beneficial as a piece of politics. Unfortunately, as I began to realise when experience started to shape our thinking, it was bunkum as a piece of policy. The whole point is that structures beget standards. How service is configured affects outcomes.’

In a major speech yesterday Mr Gove set out plans to raise standards in state schools so they become indistinguishable from private schools.

He suggested that a London state school Thomas Jones primary school in West London - where most children are brought up with English as a foreign language - offers a better education than the private Wetherby School attended by Princes William and Harry just around the corner.

Mr Gove vowed to ‘break down the Berlin wall’ between state and private schools to drive up standards.

He
 proposed state schools checking 13-year-olds’ progress by making them 
sit the Common Entrance exam, which is used by leading private schools 
to select pupils.

The school day could be lengthened to up to 10 hours to improve academic performance and offer more activities including cadets, choir and sport.

And he urged a return to old-fashioned discipline, including writing lines, sweeping up and removing graffiti.

But once again Mr Hunt’s response to the wide-ranging speech focussed on Labour’s policy that every teacher should be qualified and registered.

He said: ‘Improving school standards starts with a qualified teacher in every classroom. Until Michael Gove commits to this, he is ruling himself out of any serious debate about how we raise standards in our schools.’

A source close to Mr Gove: ‘Hunt is turning out to be a one-trick pony. He’s got nothing to say on the longer school day, discipline or rigour.

‘Instead he trots out the same hypocritical policy on teacher qualifications that would deny ordinary kids at state school the top class education he enjoyed.’

Mr Gove is not the only Conservative member of the Government linked to Mr Blair. George Osborne, the Chancellor, was reported to have referred to Mr Blair as 'the master' and used his memoir as a reference book for reform.
