So Ryan Giggs has taken his leave, in his 41st year, from the playing ranks of the only club he ever served. The hosannas ring loudly.

Rio Ferdinand, his comrade in many Manchester United glories, joked that Giggs collected so many gold medals he puts BA Baracus, of A-Team fame, to shame.

His c.v. includes two European Cups, 13 Premier League titles, four FA Cups and four League Cups, making him the most decorated player in the history of the English game.

A myth: Ryan Giggs can't be considered the greatest player in Premier League history, despite being the most decorated - his long career has been clouded by sentiment and wrapped in hyperbole

Mr Consistent: Giggs made a record 963 appearances in Red, scoring 168 goals

The best: Arsenal's former talisman Thierry Henry is the best ever player to grace the Premier League

Also to be 
applauded was his quiet yet fierce work ethic. He husbanded his physical
 gifts in a way redolent of the long careers of the old knights, Sir Tom
 Finney and Sir Stanley Matthews.

When he put on his suit for the first 
match of his short stint as interim manager last month, he was as svelte
 a figure as any seen on the touchline. The wiry, teenage Giggs had 
preserved himself as if in aspic to play nearly 1,000 games for United.

No
 wonder the sportswriter Kevin Garside observed that Giggs was the rare 
player ‘to evoke a sense of nostalgia while still on the pitch’.

That, however, points to the problem with any critical appreciation of the man. He has become a myth. The facts have been clouded by sentiment and wrapped in hyperbole.

Nothing demonstrated this more clearly than his being named 2009 BBC Sports Personality of the Year. He did not deserve the award on the evidence of those 12 months. It was bestowed on him in a fuzzy, sepia-tinged urge to recognise his longevity.

Myths are not always outright lies, though. They are often fact embellished by fiction. So, even though Giggs only retired from playing yesterday, we should perhaps start to try to disentangle fact from fiction. And one fiction, it seems to me, is the assertion that he is the greatest player in the Premier League’s 22-year history.

Winner: Giggs won 34 major honours in a glittering career at Old Trafford

Honours: They included 13 titles, four FA Cups and two Champions League titles

Invincibles: Arsenal players celebrate winning the league at White Hart Lane during their unbeaten season

Trademark: Henry scored 175 goals for Arsenal, the most by a player for a single club in the Premier League

I would contend that Thierry Henry, Arsenal’s most brillant light when they went uniquely unbeaten all season, is worthy of that accolade. His graceful speed, his incisive runs, his nerveless finishing have imprinted themselves most vividly on my mind. He scored 175 Premier League goals, more than anyone else at a single club.

There are other worthy contenders: the miserly Keane, the footloose Ronaldo, the balletic Bergkamp, the forceful Vieira, the lethal Shearer, the ingenious Zola, the imperious Cantona, the skilful Scholes, the cottage industry of Gerrard.

Giggs is worthy of comparison with them all, but we are left to ponder whether he entirely delivered on the promise that thrilled us when he was a 17-year-old winger with scampering feet.

Undeserved: Giggs won the 2009 BBC Sports Personality of the Year as a nod to his longevity

Long game: Giggs burst on to the scene as a wiry teenager at the end of the 1990-91 season - before the formation of the Premier League

Match-winners: Eric Cantona (left), Cristiano Ronaldo and Wayne Rooney (below) were always bigger stars when they played alongside Giggs - the Welshman was never the club's main man for any sustained period

He played on longer than any 
contemporary, helped by his move from the wing to deep midfield in his 
later years, yet he failed to become United’s star man for any sustained
 period in any single phase of his career.

There were always more 
dependable game-changers, the likes of Eric Cantona, Cristiano Ronaldo, 
Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie. Even David Beckham deployed his more 
limited attributes as a footballer to more clinical effect as a maker of
 goals, from the right-side of midfield.

Giggs
 was bizarrely ineffectual in the final third of the pitch, too often 
crossing in hope, as if happy to waft the responsibility on to others 
rather than to seize it himself.

The fact he did not often enough take 
command of a game is reflected by his failure to win, or come close to 
winning, the individual European or world honours that were handed to 
Ronaldo and the young Michael Owen. He failed to move into the class of 
the truly, global greats.

(In
 the spirit of fairness, I should acknowledge that my choice as the 
Premier League’s greatest, Henry, did not win the Ballon d’Or either.)

Lengthy: Sir Alex Ferguson converted Giggs from a flying winger to a crafty central midfielder

Better: Both Dennis Bergkamp (left) and Alan Shearer had a bigger impact on the Premier League than Giggs

Impact: Even David Beckham, with a more limited skill-set, was able to score and create more than Giggs did

Brilliant: Giggs scored a superb goal in the FA Cup semi-final against Arsenal but too often he was ineffectual

As for Giggs representing the best traditions of our national game, the verdict here is split. He was never sent off in a Manchester United shirt (though he was once for Wales).

He withstood the sirens of riches and celebrity. But there were black marks against his saintly image: most notably, his long affair with his brother’s wife, of all people.

He was a fine player, and even a dazzling one in his mop-haired youth. We are just saying, beware the myth.
