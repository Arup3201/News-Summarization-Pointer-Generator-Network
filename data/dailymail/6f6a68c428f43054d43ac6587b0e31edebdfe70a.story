A Queensland retiree has travelled across Australia knitting fake breasts for cancer survivors and documented her journey in a series of scenic photographs.

Retiree Dawn Toomey, 69, from Deception Bay, north of Brisbane, drove around the country with her husband Ray for three months last year sightseeing and making prostheses – called 'Knitted Knockers' – to be donated to women who have undergone mastectomies.

Ms Toomey's husband Ray took pictures of her knitting in all the spots they visited in New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia and the Northern Territory.

Ms Toomey got the idea from her daughter, who read an article about the charity Knitted Knockers Australia and suggested she get involved

Ms Toomey got the idea from her daughter, who read an article about the charity Knitted Knockers Australia and suggested she get involved.

In three months Ms Toomey knitted 128 breasts, and after returning home to Queensland she set up a local branch of the charity. There are 15 around Australia including the head office in Burwood Victoria. 

Knitted Knockers provides volunteers with 100 per cent cotton yarn, which they buy at a discounted price from Bendigo Woolen Mills with money fundraised by the organisation.

'Wool is no good, people get itchy with wool, but the cotton is very soft,' Ms Toomey said.

Ms Toomey said the Knitted Knockers are very popular with women who have had mastectomies and have decided not to undergo breast reconstructions.

'The very first person I gave a set of prostheses to was my friend Brenda, she had been wearing a heavy silicon prosthesis,' she said.

'If they sit against the body people get a heat rash, they are hot and heavy.

'When I actually gave her a set of knitted knockers she was just in tears.

'If you just wear weightless ones it still makes you look feminine without the weight of the silicon.'

Ms Toomey's trip took her all around Australia, and she took photos in places such as the Hunter Valley and Coffs Coast in New South Wales, Karajini National Park and Monkey Mia in Western Australia and Ceduna in South Australia
