Owen Labrie, 18, a recent graduate of St. Paul's School in Concord, New Hampshire, has been charged with sexually assaulting a 15-year-old freshman

A recent graduate of a prestigious New Hampshire boarding prep school has been charged with sexually assaulting a freshman as part of a student tradition in which seniors try to have sex with younger students.

A police affidavit obtained by the Concord Monitor alleges 18-year-old Owen Labrie, of Tunbridge, Vermont, sexually assaulted a 15-year-old on campus two days before he graduated from St. Paul’s School in Concord June 1.

Police say Labrie denied having sex with the girl. Results are still pending from a state lab, but the affidavit says a nurse reported observing a laceration consistent with forced intercourse.

Labrie, who is due to attend Harvard in the fall, is set for arraignment September 15 on three felony counts of sexual assault and one count of using a computer to lure the girl.

The police affidavit said St. Paul’s counselor Sandra Whelan contacted Concord police after hearing from the girl’s mother June 3.

‘Whalen informed me that there is a horrible tradition at the boarding school called the “senior salute” in which a senior emails a younger student regarding a “conquest” before they graduate,’ wrote Julie Curtin, a detective with the Concord police.

According to the document, when Labrie initially sent his ‘senior salute’ to the girl, she declined to meet with him. She later told police that she was aware there was a contest going on among upper classmen to see how many girls they could ‘hook up’ with.

Idyllic environment: The alleged rape took place in a secluded part of the 2,000-acre forested campus in June

Elite institution: Founded in 1856 as an Episcopal school, St Paul's tuition is currently at just over $50,000 a year

Labrie then went to a mutual male friend and asked him to ‘put in a good word’ for him with the freshman.

‘When she accepted Owen Labrie’s “senior salute,” her understanding was that it would be “just a hook up,” which to her meant kissing or making out and ‘that’s all,’ the affidavit said.

During their encounter in a secluded area of the bucolic 2,000-acre campus, Labrie tried to remove the freshman’s underwear and began to have sex with her, and when the girl realized what was happening, she said ‘no’ twice and at pulled back in pain, the affidavit said.

Founded in 1856 as an Episcopal school for boys, St Paul’s is only one of six fully residential high schools in the country with annual tuition of more than $50,000.

The illustrious school, which boasts 18 dormitories, a 95,000-square-foot fitness center, an 8-lane indoor pool, two hockey rinks, squash and tennis courts and a 2,000-meter rowing course with boathouse, sits atop 2,000 forested acres of land once owned by St Paul’s founder, Boston Brahmin and physician George Cheyne Shattuck.  

Graduates of the famed boarding school have included President James Garfield's son; New York City Mayor John Lindsay; half a dozen senators or congressman, including former Massachusetts Senator and current Secretary of State John Kerry, as well as a Nobel laureate and three Pulitzer Prize winners. 

There are currently 548 students from 36 states and 25 countries are attend the venerated institution.

‘She stated she did not know that was going to happen and did not want that to happen,’ the detective wrote. ‘I asked her if there was ever any conversation where she said yes and she said there was not.’

After the alleged encounter, Labrie reached out to the 15-year-old on Facebook, cautioning her: 'for so many reasons we need to make sure people don't think the wrong thing.

‘I have to trust you’ve got my back and you make sure the right people know what’s actually up,’ he said in another message, insisting that the two never had sex together.

However, in a conversation with a friend the 18-year-old allegedly admitted to having sex with the freshman and acknowledged that it was illegal because of her age.

Labrie reportedly comes from a humble family and attended St Paul's, where the annual tuition is upward of $50,000, on a scholarship.

While studying there, Labrie was a prefect in his dormitory and had signed an agreement to be a positive role model.

According to the affidavit, the teen had received training in statutory rape and consensual sex.

Mike Hirschfeld, rector of the 540-student St. Paul’s whose graduates included Secretary of State John Kerry and President James Garfield's son, wrote about Labrie’s arrest in a letter to parents this month.

‘When this matter was first brought to our attention by the young woman involved, we reported it to the authorities, as is our obligation, and we are cooperating fully with law enforcement,’ Hirschfeld wrote.

‘This situation has been alarming to me personally and to all adults here, in a community that values healthy relationships so highly.’

If convicted, Labrie could face prison time and be required to register as a sex offender. He is out on $15,000 bail.

Speaking to Boston Globe, his attorney said there are facts surrounding the case that will cast it in a different light.
