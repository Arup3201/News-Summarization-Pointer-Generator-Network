An outbreak of food poisoning is bad news for any restaurant. Especially when a group of council health inspectors are amongst the unlucky diners.

Almost half of the ten-strong group of inspectors fell ill after dining at the Kayal eaterie on a work night out earlier this month. 

As a result, the south Indian restaurant 
has been closed until further notice until tests confirm the source of 
an outbreak which has claimed 19 victims in total.

The restaurant, in Leicester, has received five-star ratings in its last three council inspections - the most recent of which was just last month. It has also won awards for its service and standards and has featured on Hairy Bikers’ Best Of British BBC2 show.

Earlier this year the Great British Bake Off’s Paul Hollywood also visited the restaurant to learn how to make spinach dosa. As part of the episode for his BBC2 series, Bread, Hollywood told viewers: ‘We have here a very good Indian restaurant called Kayal and they make some of the best tasting bread I have ever had.

‘Rice-based, lentil-based, flour-based, it doesn’t seem to matter to these guys, they produce pure magic.’

The restaurant was closed on November 6 
after 19 people reported feeling unwell over the previous fortnight. 
Samples of food have been taken away for analysis.

Owner Jaimon Thomas said the group of 10 Leicester City Council officers visited the restaurant for a social event on November 2, and four became ill.

He added: ‘It was unlucky that we had the council in, and that it included health inspectors, but we would obviously be concerned if anyone at all reported feeling ill.

‘We’ve been open since 2008 and this is the first time we’ve had any problems whatsoever with people getting sick.

‘We had a number of people come to us and say they had stomach aches. We refunded the money straight away and offered them a free meal, which they gladly accepted.

‘The fact the council health inspectors chose to eat there is testament to how highly they rate the restaurant.’

Mr Thomas said the restaurant has high standards and a ‘very good reputation’, and he was ‘determined’ to discover what had gone wrong.

Last month, a Leicester City Council health inspection team rated the business ‘very good’ and awarded it five stars. On-the-spot visits in May 2012 and October 2010, also resulted in five-star reports.

David Barclay Rhodes, food safety team manager at the council, said: ‘Kayal has always achieved a high level of compliance with food hygiene law. We asked it to close while we investigated a suspected food poisoning outbreak.

‘We do not know what’s made people ill and await the results of samples taken. We can’t comment further.’

Mr Thomas said the restaurant would be using the time it is closed to refit the kitchen.

The council said it did not comment on personal information relating to staff, but confirmed there was an outbreak of illness.

The restaurant, part of a small chain with branches in Nottingham, Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, and West Byfleet in Surrey, is rated 14th out of 664 city eateries on the TripAdvisor website, with a string of positive reviews.

However, the most recent review, posted on Friday, warned of the food poisoning outbreak.

The reviewer, called ‘Hannah C’, said she and her partner both fell ill for at least a fortnight after an anniversary meal at the restaurant on October 13.

In a post headed ‘food poisoning’, she wrote: ‘I had to miss work for a week and unfortunately has put me off eating Indian food and chicken. Incredibly disappointing.’
