Harry Kane was on cloud nine after his double earned Tottenham a 2-1 north London derby win over Arsenal at White Hart Lane.

The striker tapped home the equaliser before netting an 86th-minute winner with a superb header as Spurs fought back from conceding an early opener to Mesut Ozil.

Kane, who has now scored 22 goals in all competitions this season, said on BT Sport 1: 'That feeling is one I definitely won't forget for the rest of my career.

'My first north London derby, to win the way we did, it's incredible. I probably won't sleep tonight.'

Kane's rise this season has been meteoric, but the 21-year-old insists he is having no problem keeping his feet on the ground.

'I enjoy my football,' he said. 'Just play with a smile on your face, do the best you can, work as hard as you can for the team. It's been working well for us as a team, an incredible bunch of lads, the spirit's high.

'I just want to be out on that pitch, playing with my mates. We are playing very well, we just want the next game to come.'

Kane's team-mate Ryan Mason hailed the Tottenham fans, saying: 'I don't think there will be many better atmospheres around the world than what it was today.'

Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino described the win as a 'special moment' before backing Kane to get better and better.

'His quality and his potential is massive, he can improve more,' he said on BT Sport 1.

Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger had no complaints over the result, but was unhappy with the performance of referee Martin Atkinson.

He said: 'They created more chances and we cannot dispute too much that they win the game. The regret we have is that I believe we gave the goals away, the first and the second. But we didn't produce enough going forward.'

The Frenchman added: 'I think we were not very good and the referee was at our level.'
