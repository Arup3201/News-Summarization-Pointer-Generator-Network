Hull City have confirmed the signing of Mohamed Diame from West Ham on a three-and-a-half-year contract.

The 27-year-old midfielder made 79 appearances for the Hammers after joining from Wigan in 2012.

Tiger boss Steve Bruce said: ‘I’m delighted to welcome Mohamed to the Club.

‘His experience, both at international level and in the Premier League will be invaluable for us as we look to cement our place in the top-flight.’

Hull, meanwhile, completed the £9.5m club-record signing of Uruguay striker Abel Hernandez earlier on Monday.

Diame joined the Hammers in 2012 after three impressive seasons with Wigan, and in January last year Arsenal were rumoured to be interested in the Senegalese midfielder.
