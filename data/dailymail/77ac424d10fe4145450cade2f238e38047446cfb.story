The teenager whose insurance company refused to pay for dentures after he lost his teeth beating two different types of cancer now has the money to pay for them thanks to the kindness of strangers.

Alex Hunter, 16, raised the $11,000 he needs through his gofundme page in just 20 hours, so touched were the public by his story.

Alex, from Delano, California, made the tough decision to get his 19 remaining teeth removed two weeks ago after years of radiation left them fragile and impossible to use.

While his insurance - which is provided by the state because of his mother's job working for Bakersfield - covered part of the procedure to remove the teeth, it would not cover the dentures, his family said.

'They say it's not a medical issue but they know they took out the teeth because of a medical issue,' his grandmother, Roberta Hunter, told MailOnline earlier on Tuesday. 'It feels like the insurance is just bailing out on him.'

Fighter: Alex Hunter, 16, has had all of his teeth removed after battling cancer twice -and his insurance company declined to cover his dentures because it is not a medical issue

Now the teenager, who loves to sing and one day hopes to be a counselor, will be able to go ahead and get his dentures fitted.

Alex's family, who have never asked for anything throughout Alex's 11 years of treatments launched their gofundme page, Alex Hunter's Medical Fund, only yesterday in the hope of raising the money.

By Tuesday afternoon, when the MailOnline first published Alex's story, the fund stood at $1,000, but in a little less than six hours had smashed through its target.

The family is also applying for funds through various charitable foundations - anything that can help Alex get back his smile.

Goal reached: Alex Hunter's gofundme page has managed to raise the $11,000 he needs to have dentures fitted after his insurance company declined to pay for them

On the mend: Alex was first diganosed with cancer when he was four and overcame it, before being diagnosed again when he was 13. His family is now hopeful that he is cancer-free for the second time

'He doesn't smile because his teeth were never attractive,' his grandmother said earlier about the brave teen. 'He was anxious to get them out and get it over with but now we're waiting to see what's next.'

Inspiration: Despite his health struggles, Alex is a top student who dreams of becoming a counselor

Alex was just four when he was first diagnosed with a rare type of cancer, Embryonal Parameningeal Rhabdomyosarcoma, after a mass started growing in his cheek.

He underwent aggressive chemotherapy and stayed in hospital for months as he battled the side effects of the radiation. He lost vision in his left eye and feeling on the left side of his face.

He was also left with a thin frame, teeth problems and thyroid gland issues, but in July 2003, doctors said he was cancer-free.

Then in November 2011, when he was 13, he was back to hospital to undergo surgery on an enlarged thyroid gland - and doctors learned he had Hurthle Cell Carcinoma, a rare thyroid cancer.

On the gofundme page, his family explained that the cancer is believed to be an effect of treatment from his first battle with cancer.

But now, nearly three years on from his second diagnosis, and his family say he is free from cancer again. One final scan in October will confirm that he is again cancer-free.

In the meantime, Alex is impressing his family with his commitment as a student and a friend.

Relatives told KERO that he once put together a yearbook for a friend, including photos and signatures from staff and students, after the teen could not afford to buy one from the school.

Hopeful: His mother Liz, pictured right, launched a gofundme help and is appealing to foundations for funds

Alex is also taking advanced placement classes and has been singing with the choir for two years. He is already thinking about college, where he wants to major in psychology and sociology.

'He's just so positive,' his grandmother said. 'He sings, he's really active in school - but kids do stare at him. I can't wait for him to get his teeth but right now all we can do is take it one day at a time.'
