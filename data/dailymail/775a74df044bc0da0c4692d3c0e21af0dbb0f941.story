A  mother-of-two has detailed her transition away from the typical 'tiger mom' parenting she used to employ in favor of a more relaxed and nurturing approach.

Tanith Carey, 47, a journalist based in London, admits she academically over-stretched her daughter Lily, now 12, to the point where she became anxious, self-critical, and was actually under-performing.

'The stressed and anxious kids of today are the depressed adults of tomorrow,' she tells MailOnline. 'Tiger parenting wrecks family life and it ruins our enjoyment of parenting. It's heartbreaking.'

Reformed: Tanith Carey, 47, (pictured) admits she academically over-stretched her daughter Lily, now 12, to the point where she became anxious and self-critical, but has since changed her ways

Ms Carey's competitive streak first made itself known when Lily was just two years old, while the family was living in New York and Lily had just been denied a place at Manhattan’s elite International Preschool. 

At the time, according to a piece written by Jane Ridley for The New York Post, Ms Carey was 'devastated' over the rejection.

Now she 'shudders' when she remembers how much she let it get to her, and how inadequate she felt as a mother.

The next few years in New York were a flurry of prestigious schools, expensive private tutors and jam-packed after-school activities schedules.

Phew: 'Now there is no longer tension and expectation, Lily has got rid of those negative voices,' says Ms Carey, pictured with her daughter Clio, nine, (left), husband Anthony (center right) and Lily (right)

Ms Carey, a working mom, claims she once supplied her nanny with a 20-page instructions manual to keep Lily and her other daughter Clio, now nine, on track.

'I asked her to play Bach and Mozart in the background while [they were] eating breakfast,' she said. 'They went to every toddler music, ballet and art class I could find.'

It wasn't until Lily was seven years old and in second grade at a private school back in London that Ms Carey got her wake-up call.

Lily had won a science prize, but rather than be happy, she fled the ceremony 'in tears.'

Ironically, it was an educational psychologist Ms Carey had hired who advised her to relax the reins and to drop the intensive after-school learning centers Lily had been attending.

'Tiger parenting backfires ultimately because while we think we are "improving" our children, in fact, over-stretched, anxious kids don’t learn,' she tells us.

'One of the most worrying things is that kids internalize critical voices in their own heads because they are constantly told they "must do better" in this hot-house educational environment.'

Ms Carey, who claims her own parents weren't strict with her at all, points to a specific area of Lily's education as having caused the young girl anxiety in the past: math.

She had simply made her mind up that she was 'rubbish' at it and was having serious trouble overcoming her mental block; a time during which she had a private math tutor, and when Ms Carey was in the habit of standing over her at homework time.

'Now there is no longer that tension and expectation around the subject, and she has got rid of those negative voices, she is actually excelling in that subject,' Ms Carey reports.

'The other day she came home beaming because she scored 78per cent in her math test – something that was unheard of a few years ago - and that was completely down to her and nothing to do with me.'

Where once Ms Carey's first questions when her kids got home from school every day centered around tests or performance, she now focuses on different aspects. 

'Now I am more interested in hearing about what games they played and how they got along with their friends,' she says.

'And now when I am with my kids, it’s not about constantly looking for "teachable moments." It’s just about being together.'

Even when Ms Carey feels her perfectionist urges come on, she manages to turn her thinking round. 'It’s just not fair on kids to make them run a race they didn’t ask to compete in,' she remarks.

Ms Carey's book, Taming The Tiger Parent, is at definite odds with a well-known book released by infamous tiger mom Amy Chua in 2011, Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother.

Ms Chua, a 52-year-old Yale Law School professor and mom to two daughters, prompted a widespread backlash after the memoir was released, with critics blasting her extreme parenting approach.

'I was raised by very strict Chinese immigrant parents,' Ms Chua writes on her website.

'As parents, they demanded total respect and were very tough with my three younger sisters and me. 

'We got in trouble for A minuses, had to drill math and piano every day, no sleepovers, no boyfriends.

'But the strategy worked with me.... that’s why I tried to raise my own two daughters the same way my parents raised me.'

Ms Carey, who has read the book, isn't so sure.

'I really admired Amy's honesty,' she says. 'But it was one of the things that got the ball rolling for me.

'It showed how pushy parenting can alienate parents from their children, something that she experienced with her second daughter.'

Indeed, Ms Chua writes of Lulu: 'My younger daughter seemed to turn against everything I stood for and it felt like I was losing her and everything was falling apart. At 13, she rebelled.'

Ms Chua may have been very open about her tiger parenting, but many moms have a habit of keeping their methods behind closed doors, suggests Ms Carey.

'These parents - I call them 'swans' - aim to ensure their children do better than everyone else’s,' she says.

'But to make it look as if it’s all by magic – and done without any pushing or tutoring - because their offspring are genetically blessed.'

Now that Lily, who is thriving, is left more to her own devices, she has developed a love for playing the violin. Her sister Clio is doing well too. 

'I believe and hope that truly being themselves, rather than living up to my expectations, has made both my children happier and more resilient,' Ms Carey concludes.
