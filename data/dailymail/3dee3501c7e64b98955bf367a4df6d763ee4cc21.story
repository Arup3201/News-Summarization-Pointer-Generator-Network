With a bathtub like this, why leave home?

For a select few of the New York's moneyed Manhattanites, there is no need to visit a spa or check into a luxurious hotel to submerge themselves and sit back - because it's waiting for them at home.

The MailOnline has taken a look inside the most well-to-do tubs the Big Apple has to offer.

After all, in the city that never sleeps, who wouldn't want to spend the night soaking up an incredible view?

Winner: The $95 million penthouse at 432 Park Avenue, in midtown Manhattan, recently became the tallest residential site in the Western Hemisphere, eclipsing the Empire State Building, the Chrysler Building and One World Trade Center without its spire

Good morning: Facing south and looking over the West Village and all the way downtown, the view from Chelsea's Walker Tower is the best way to start the day

Lap of luxury: The marble bathrooms of the building are the definition of decadence 

An obvious choice to top the list is the penthouse of 432 Park Avenue, in midtown Manhattan, which recently became the tallest residential site in the Western Hemisphere, eclipsing the Empire State Building, the Chrysler Building and One World Trade Center without its spire. 

But at $95 million for the five bedroom apartment, you would expect a fairly decent lavatory.

Next up is the Walker Tower at 212 West 18th Street.

For some of the owners of the south-facing condos of this Chelsea building - designed by CetraRuddy, an architecture firm based in New York - their all-marble bathrooms look over the West Village all the way to the Financial District and the Statue of Liberty.

Substantially cheaper than the penthouse at 432 Park, a three-bedroom apartment in Walker Tower was recently listed for $25 million.

Further south from Chelsea, a little below Canal Street, you'll find the new 60-story Tribeca structure 56 Leonard Street. 

The building with open next year and is almost sold out.

Curbed recently reported there were but two of the 145 apartments left - the $34.5 million penthouse and another condo, listed for $17.5 million.

Modern favorite: Simplistic and chic, the new building at 56 Leonard Street in Tribeca has almost entirely sold out - and it doesn't open until next year

Midtown: 252 East 57th Street offers the most incredible look at the heart of New York City from the Upper East Side

Commanding the best views of Midtown is a new 65-story high-rise at 252 East 57th Street.

This is the exact bath who want to sit in and dusk and watch as millions of residents and pedestrians make their way through the city's center during early evening rush hour.

A five-bedroom apartment inside the building is worth around $21.25 million.
