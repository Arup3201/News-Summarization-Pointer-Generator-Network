Two cops in Los Angeles are being investigated by LAPD's internal affairs department after they pulled over singer Ray J when he appeared to text while driving — but let him go with a warning and a series of pictures of them together.

The officers pulled Ray J's Bentley over on Wednesday when they noticed the singer holding his cell phone, TMZ reported.

The cops were also suspicious because 
the singer's car doesn't have a license plate, but only a custom 'RJ' 
frame.

Singer Ray J told LAPD cops that he was just trying to connect his bluetooth headset when he was pulled over this week. He was released with a warning and even posed for pictures with the cops

Ray J, 33, who is infamous for starring in the sex tape that propelled Kim Kardashian to stardom, told the cops he was just having problems connecting his bluetooth headset.

The two LAPD officers warned him to not to text while driving — but then asked him to step out of the Bentley.

Ray J panicked, he told TMZ.

But it t turns out the cops just wanted to take pictures with the singer.

He agreed and later asked them to take a few with his phone.

The LAPD has since launched an internal affairs investigation over the incident on suspicion of impropriety, the gossip website reports.

Ray J was charged last month with a string of misdemeanour counts stemming from an alleged altercation at a Beverly Hills hotel

Wednesday's encounter is by far an improvement for Ray J.

The singer was charged in July with resisting arrest, battery and vandalism after allegedly causing a disturbance in a posh Beverly Hills hotel.

He allegedly got rowdy at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel bar and was ordered to leave when he brushed up against a woman's rear.

The singer also allegedly kicked out a window of a police car after he was handcuffed.

Ray J is infamous for being Kim Kardashian's partner in the sex tape that propelled her to reality television stardom
