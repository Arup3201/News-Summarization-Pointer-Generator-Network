Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero was spotted driving his new Lamborghini after it was customised by Yianni Charalambous.

Charalambous revealed on Twitter that he had hooked up with the Argentina centre forward before travelling back to his London base.

Aguero, pictured shaking hands with the car star, was standing in front of the black Lamborghini Aventador.

Charalambous, who states on his Twitter account that he supplies and customises cars for footballers and singers, has previously worked on vehicles belonging to Chelsea captain John Terry, Manchester City right back Bacary Sagna and music artist Lethal Bizzle.

Aguero, who has been on international duty with Argentina during the last two weeks, will be hoping to feature in Manchester City's next fixture against Tottenham.

The 26-year-old has scored six goals in nine games for Manuel Pellegrini's side so far this season. 

And he enjoyed playing against Spurs last season, scoring three times against them in two matches - City plundered 11 in those games. 

The former Atletico Madrid man was clearly eager to drive his car as he was the first player out of training
