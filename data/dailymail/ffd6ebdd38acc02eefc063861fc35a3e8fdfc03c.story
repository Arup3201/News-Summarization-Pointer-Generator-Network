Trim: 54-year-old Carole dropped a staggering 12 dress sizes after her doctor told her she could be dead in two years

A woman who lost almost 20st after being told by her doctor that she could be dead within two years has dropped 12 dress sizes to be named Slimming World's Woman of the Year.

Carole Wright, 54, weighed almost 30st and was virtually housebound, unable to perform simple tasks such as putting on her shoes or loading the washing machine.

She left her house just four times between January and September 2009.

In just over two years, Ms Wright, from Southport, Merseyside, has lost 19st 10lbs and 27 inches from her waist after attending her local Slimming World group.

She said: 'The last time I weighed 
10st I was 10 years old. My life is completely different from two years 
ago. I've got a job in a sandwich shop so I'm talking to customers and 
on my feet all day.

'I don't have pain in my knees 
anymore and I haven't used my inhaler for over a year.

'I can do all of 
the little things everyone else takes for granted like putting my own 
shoes on, painting my toe nails and walking up stairs - in fact, I run 
up them now.'

The award-winning slimmer, who has always been known as 'Big Carole', has 
not only suffered from weight-related ailments, but has faced bullying 
and criticism about her size since she was young.

Ms
Wright said: 'I was called names as a child and as an adult. Strangers 
in the street would make rude comments and the kids next door would 
shout abuse when I was hanging out the washing.

'I tried to lose weight on my own but within days I'd be back to eating unhealthily.'

Bullied: Nicknamed Big Carole, 30-stone Ms Wright suffered taunts about her size from a young age

It
was soon after her 50th birthday in 2007 that Ms Wright's weight 
started getting dangerously out of control, at a time when she was 
forced to quit working due to a crippling knee injury.

She
added: 'I couldn't do anything for myself anymore. I couldn't stand to 
peel potatoes or go upstairs without crawling on all fours.

'I
relied on my asthma inhaler constantly and my son Jonathan, who's now 
15, had to help around the house. All I ever did was watch television or
sit at the computer.

Shock: Carole was mortified at her slimming group's initial weigh-in, but with the support of her fellow slimmers she managed to gradually shed the pounds

'It
got to the stage where I wasn't only trapped inside the house, I was 
trapped in my own body too and I couldn't see a way out.'

It was during the nine-month period 
in 2009 when she left her house just four times that Ms Wright received a
shock warning from her GP.

'If you don't do something about your weight, you're going to be dead in two years,' he said.

Terrified
by this stark message, Ms Wright decided it was time to make changes 
and embark on a project which would potentially save her life.

Reminder: Carole with one of the large skirts she used to comfortably fill

She
attended her first slimming class in September and even though she was 
shocked at her initial weight, found the group hugely supportive and is 
now a trim size 10.

She said: 'Weighing almost 30st was a
huge shock and I burst into tears. That was hard, but the group was so 
instantly supportive - as soon as they saw my tears they all gave me 
hugs and words of encouragement.

'They gave me the confidence to give 
it a go. Since then they've become like family to me. They've supported 
me all the way through my journey.

'For the first time in my life I feel normal and it's a great feeling.

Slimming
World has not only given me my life back, it's saved my life because I 
know if I hadn't lost weight I'd have been dead by now.'
