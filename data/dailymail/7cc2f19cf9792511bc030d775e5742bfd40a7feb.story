More than 30 gay couples will reportedly wed on-air during Macklemore & Ryan Lewis' performance of Same Love at the Grammy Awards.

Queen Latifah will act as officiant during the televised ceremony as the duo perform the marriage-equality anthem with Madonna at the Staples Center in Los Angeles.

According to the New York Times, 34 gay, straight and interracial couples - including Lewis' sister and her boyfriend - will exchange vows.

Time to say I do: Dozens of couples will marry on air during Sunday night's live broadcast of the music industry's annual Grammy Awards as Macklemore & Ryan Lewis perform their nominated song Same Love

34 couples from different orientations and backgrounds --gay, straight, of different races and so on - will be married during the 'Same Love' performance .

In an interview, Lewis, whose own sister will be part of the ceremony in getting married to her boyfriend, said that the weddings 'will be in our minds the ultimate statement of equality, that all the couples are entitled to the same exact thing.'

The wedding's rehearsal took place on Saturday at the Staples Center, where the couples walked up and down aisles near the GRAMMY stage -- where they'll actually be married, as show producer Ken Ehrlich stated that putting the soon-to-be-wed pairs onstage 'could be viewed as more exploitative.'

"It seemed like less of a ‘show’ than if I put them onstage,' Ehrlich explained. 'I don’t want them to feel as though they’re on parade,' he told the New York Times.

Emotional ceremony: For Macklemore & Ryan Lewis, the event took on a personal note with the participation of Lewis's sister Laura, who married her boyfriend during the ceremony

The idea for the weddings originated last fall when Mr. Ehrlich sat down with Macklemore & Ryan Lewis over a fried-chicken lunch to brainstorm ideas for a possible performance. Knowing that their concerts have occasionally featured onstage marriage proposals, Mr. Ehrlich suggested taking it a step further with a full wedding.

The band was into it, so a casting agency was hired to find the couples, who at first were told only that the ceremony would take place on live television. The couples each signed confidentiality agreements — promising not to tell even their families.

Defending the multi-marriage stunt from critics who are already beginning to voice their opinions against the Grammy wedding ceremony, National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences president Neil Portnoy says, 'I expect that people with all kinds of opinions might voice them, and that's healthy, but we don't need to stoop to the level of trying to find gimmicks and sensationalistic approaches to what we do.'

Prior to the Grammys performance, Lewis said that the weddings 'will be in our minds the ultimate statement of equality, that all the couples are entitled to the same exact thing'

For Macklemore & Ryan Lewis, whose 'Same Love' is up for song of the year, the event took on a personal note with the participation of Lewis's sister Laura, who will marry her boyfriend during the ceremony.

'A night that is already tremendous for me, for the music,' the Times quoted him as saying, "but to have my sister get married and my family there watching it — that makes it a whole other level of amazing.'

The group is nominated for a total of seven Grammys.

The GRAMMYs will be broadcast tonight at 8 p.m. on CBS.
