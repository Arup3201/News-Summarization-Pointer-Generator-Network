American actor Steven Seagal has been pictured touring a Russian arms fair, days after playing a controversial concert in the Crimea.

The action star and musician was pictured holding sniper rifles, pistols and heavy arms at the Oboronexpo-2014 in Moscow, while hobnobbing with senior members of the Russian government.

During the event he spoke with Russian deputy prime minister Dmitry Rogozin and top military figures, in between looking down the sights of the lethal arms on display.

As well as the infantry equipment on display inside, outside the exhibition centre Russian tanks fired rounds into the air, gouts of flame pouring from their turrets.

According to the Kremlin-backed Russia Today news outlet, Rogozin said: 'I invited my friend here, a lot of people criticise him at home, it is not an easy time for him right now'.

Seagal was attacked just days ago for playing a concert for Russian separatists in the Crimea, which Russia annexed from Ukraine just months ago.

In the past he has been pictured with Russian president Vladimir Putin watching martial arts displays.

During the performance on Sunday he sang and strummed his guitar on a stage set up with the flag of pro-Russian rebels, who are currently fighting the Ukrainian government in the Donetsk and Lugansk regions which border Russia.

Some reports said the stage was also bedecked with Nazi symbols - a reference to the common rebel slur that the Kiev government are fascists - though Seagal vigorously denied the claims.

He instead claimed the concert had no political motive and was 'just a good old-fashioned blues concert.'

The statement said: 'There was no glorification of war or political motives during the concert which had been booked for many months beforehand.

'It was also reported that there were Radical [sic] flags placed on the stage whilst I was performing this is simply not true and we have photos and film proving this is inaccurate.

I was handed a T-shirt and I raised it up as a gesture of goodwill. I am an actor and a musician and we were there for the love of Blues music and nothing else.

I want to thank the organizers and all those decent kind peaceful people who attended and enjoyed both the music and the event...

'However I feel both my loyal worldwide fans and other free thinking people know this was just a good old fashioned blues concert.' 

When asked about his attendance at the arms fair, Seagal's agent revealed that the actor works for one of the arms dealing companies - and is also a personal friend of deputy prime minister Rogozin.

He told MailOnline: 'Steven was attending the Fair as he is a designer for one of the weapon manufacturing companies.

'Steven is passionate about his music and is very popular in all of Eastern Europe and believes that sharing his music helps to bring people together.

'Whilst he does not support all of Russia’s activities, he does not see this as a reason not to visit old friends such as Dmitry.'
