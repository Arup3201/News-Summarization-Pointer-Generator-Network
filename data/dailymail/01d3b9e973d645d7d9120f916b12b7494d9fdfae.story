Police have arrested an 18-year-old man on suspicion of shooting and killing an Army veteran on a sidewalk in the San Fernando Valley.

A witness claims that Vincent Estrada shouted 'are you ready for this' before opening fire. 

Estrada was arrested Tuesday in the Sylmar area and booked on suspicion of murder, Los Angeles police spokeswoman Officer Nuria Vanegas said.

Mourning: A friend of Mr Garcia cries next to flowers and candles placed on the sidewalk where he was shot

Vincent Estrada (not pictured) was arrested Tuesday in the Sylmar area and booked on suspicion of murder, Los Angeles police spokeswoman Officer Nuria Vanegas said

Vanegas says she had no information on the motive behind Sunday's attack on Francisco Garcia, but police suggested that a dispute between the pair that erupted earlier in the evening may be linked.

Police and witnesses said 21-year-old Mr Garcia had left a party at his girlfriend's house when two cars pulled up to him.

A man in one of the cars jumped out, smashed a beer bottle on the ground and yelled at Garcia.

Investigators said the killer then walked to the other car, grabbed a handgun and allegedly began shooting at Garcia.

Garcia had returned from Afghanistan over the summer.

Brian Enriquez, 21, who had been friends with Mr Garcia since they were in sixth grade, is overcome with grief at the scene of the shooting

Los Angeles police Lt. Paul Vernon told reporters that 'the ironies are obvious. To survive as a soldier in an overseas conflict, only to be killed in your neighborhood upon your return.'

Vernon said: 'Apparently a simmering dispute had boiled over during the night, and this suspect came looking for Francisco.'

Authorities talked to several witnesses and collected evidence, including several bullet casings.

Brian Enriquez, 21, told the Los Angeles Times that the suspect said: 'Are you ready for this?' before opening fire.

'He was a very loving, caring person,' Enriquez said. 'He would always have a smile on his face. An all-around amazing individual.'
