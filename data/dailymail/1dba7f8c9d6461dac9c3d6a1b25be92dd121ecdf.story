Stop: U.S. District Judge Catherine Perry in St. Louis ordered that the ' keep it moving' policy cease

A federal judge ordered Missouri law enforcement agencies to stop forcing protesters to 'keep moving' or face arrest deeming the practice unconstitutional.

U.S. District Judge Catherine Perry in St. Louis ordered that the practice cease following a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union of Missouri challenging the policy. 

In an effort to control angry crowds, authorities in Ferguson, Missouri have used the tactic on those demonstrating over the Aug. 9 murder of the unarmed African-American teen Michael Brown who was shot and killed by Darren Wilson, a Ferguson Police Department officer.

Since the murder, violent protests have taken place in the small Missouri town, many have been arrested, and many peaceful protesters have been threatened with arrest for failing to 'keep it moving.' 

But not anymore.

Perry issued an injunction Monday, the Guardian reports, stating that the police tactic unjustly restricts protester's First Amendment rights.

Keep it moving: U.S. District Judge Catherine Perry in St. Louis ordered that the ' keep it moving' policy cease following a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union of Missouri challenging the policy

Missouri State highway patrol and St. Louis County police are no longer permitted to 'arrest, threaten to arrest, or order to move' those standing on Ferguson public sidewalks not breaking the law, according to Perry. 

In the order, Perry described the tactic as a 'blanket rule' that is being used on those assembling peacefully.

Five-second rule: Ferguson police began using the tactic in mid-August calling it the 'five-second rule' telling protesters that they must be moving at all times and couldn't stand still for more than five seconds without facing arrest.

Perry wrote in the order that she issued the injunction 'because it is likely that these agencies will again apply this unconstitutional policy.'

Though this 'unconstitutional' policy has been halted, Perry reportedly warned that police may still enforce Missouri's failure-to-disperse law as well as other laws to control crowds and protect both people and property, USA Today reports. 

Protests and civil disorder began shortly after the 18-year-old was killed and the Washington Post reports that police began using the tactic in mid-August calling it the 'five-second rule' telling protesters that they must be moving at all times and couldn't stand still for more than five seconds without facing arrest.

The Guardian reports that St. Louis county police chief testified that the policy was only intended for use when crowds grew dangerous and unruly. 

However, Perry wrote in her order that officers were not given specific circumstances in which to use the tactic and that the policy was an 'ad hoc rule' used when ever the officers 'felt like it.'

The lawsuit was filed by ACLU Missouri member Mustafa Abdullah and ACLU officials say the injunction is a 'huge win for peaceful protesters and those who believe in the rule of law.'
