Brooke Mueller is said to have entered rehab due to addiction issues with prescription medication.

The ex-wife of Charlie Sheen is apparently hooked on Adderall - a powerful psycho-stimulant used to treat Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).

It makes it the 19th time the reality star and actress has checked into rehab, according to TMZ.

A spokesman for 35-year-old Mueller -
who was rushed to hospital on Friday after reportedly overdosing on the
drug - declined to comment to MailOnline about her rehabilitation.

TMZ reports Mueller was admitted to a facility on Monday night for an 'undetermined period of time'.

More trouble: Brooke, pictured on Thursday evening, is said to have entered rehab on Monday night following an apparent overdose on Adderall last week

Her lawyer, Yale Galanter, is quoted by the website as saying: 'Brooke was uncomfortable with the way Adderall was making her behave.'

He insisted she had no illegal drugs in her system when she overdosed last week.

The former wife of Charlie Sheen - who has twins Bob and Max, three, 
with the Anger Management star - was taken from her home in Tarzana, Los
Angeles to a nearby hospital on Friday morning after being found 
unconscious.

According to gossip website TMZ, a very low amount of alcohol was also present in her system when she was tested.

Mueller, who pleaded guilty to a 
felony drug possession back in May, is not allowed to drink alcohol 
under the terms of her one-year probation.

But her attorney added that the low level is very unlikely to constitute a probation violation.

He said: 'Brooke continues her lifelong battle with drug addiction
by taking these steps herself to prevent a further drug relapse.'

After being discharged from hospital last week, Brooke is said to have told
friends she took more than the prescribed dose of her attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder medication (Adderall).

Mueller's publicist spoke out at the 
time of the incident, insisting no drugs were involved, despite initial 
reports over an overdose.

Steve Honig said in a statement that Brooke was mistakenly believed to 
be unresponsive while sleeping, telling MailOnline: 'An assistant thought
Brooke was non-responsive while she was napping and hastily called an 
ambulance.

'As a precaution, Brooke was brought 
to a local hospital and discharged after an hour. She was diagnosed with
exhaustion and dehydration and is now fine and resting at home. That's 
it.'

In June, Charlie, 47, urged 35-year-old Brooke to check herself into 
rehab after he became concerned about her when she reportedly appeared 
'out of it' during a visit to his home.

A source close to Brooke said at the time, she 'partied for four days straight ... and ultimately fell off the wagon'.

The insider added: 'Brooke's family is hoping that she finally 
understands the consequences of her actions. That is, she risks losing 
all of her rights to the children if she doesn't get clean - once and 
for all.'
