Guilty: Michael Hood, who has been jailed for eight years for raiding an Edinburgh jewellers

An armed robber who stole £1.35 million in a raid on a central Edinburgh jewellers has been sentenced to eight years in prison.

Michael Hood, 32, from Royston Mains Edinburgh acted as getaway driver for a three man gang which made off with luxury watches and jewellery following the robbery on a Hamilton and Inches store in the Scottish capital.

The gang, armed with machetes and axes, terrorised shoppers in the day-light raid on the prosperous shopping area in George Street, the High Court in Livingston, West Lothian heard. 

The jury found Hood guilty of robbery for his involvement. He was given a shorter sentence for driving the white BMW in which the trio made their escape.

Sentencing Hood to eight years, backdated to July last year when he was first remanded, Judge Lord Glennie said the armed raid was 'a very serious offence'.

'You snatched a very valuable collection of watches and jewellery from one of the principal shopping streets in Edinburgh,' Lord Glennie said.

'The gang, of which its been found you formed a part, armed with machetes and axes clearly terrorised the people within the shop.

'Your role was clearly that of the getaway driver although, as part of the gang, you bear equal responsibility in law,' he added.

During the trial the jury was shown CCTV footage of the armed robbers smashing display cabinets and emptying the contents of displays into rucksacks in the professional-looking 90-second operation.

The trio ordered staff to lie on the floor before smashing their way through armoured glass display cabinets to grab fistfuls of valuables.

The robbers took rings, necklaces and a collection of gem-studded Patek Phillipe timepieces which alone were worth £580,000

The three men - wearing identical balaclavas and boiler suits - took rings, necklaces and a collection of gem-studded Patek Phillipe timepieces which alone were worth £580,000.

The trio, armed with machetes and axes, ordered staff to lie on the floor before smashing their way through armoured glass display cabinets to grab fistfuls of valuables.

Some criticism was raised over police conduct during the investigation into the robbery.

Defending QC Mark Stewart claimed the evidence against his client had been 'tainted' and 'polluted' by senior officers from Police Scotland's Serious Crime Squad and compared their tactics to the actions of corrupt cops in the fictional 70s TV series The Sweeney.

Hood was eventually linked to the crime through DNA evidence which was found in two getaway cars used.

Senior Investigating officer Detective Chief Inspector Stuart Houston said the convivtion had come about 'as a result of excellent police work across a number of police forces.'

'This robbery left several members of staff extremely shaken and caused extensive damage to the premises on top of the loss of the luxury items,' Houston said.

'His conviction today should serve as a reminder that offences of this nature will not be tolerated and those found to be responsible will be brought to task,' he added.
