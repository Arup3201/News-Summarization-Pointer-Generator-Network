The Roman Originals two-toned dress sparked one of the fiercest online debates in recent times, with users taking to social media to argue over what colours they saw.

But whilst it fascinated the globe - with A-listers and politicians having their say - would you actually ever purchase it?

The makers of the original dress are hoping someone will do just that, as they produce a gold and white version to satisfy those who were baffled by its colouring and auction it off on eBay for charity.

David Horwich, creative director of 100% Digital, who shot the new images, told MailOnline: 'London is the fashion capital of the world and we’re privileged to have shot the first ever genuinely 'White and Gold' dress here today in our studios.

'We’re delighted that Roman Originals trusted us to capture the world’s most famous dress, in its true colours.'

The picture of #TheDress - as it became known - was first posted on Tumblr by Caitlin McNeill, a 21-year-old aspiring singer from Scotland, after noticing her friends saw different colours in the photograph.   

This picture of the dress sparked debate, with viewers disagreeing over the colour

Even celebrities weighed in on the fashion debate, with Kim Kardashian asking her 29.4million Twitter followers to help settle a disagreement between herself and husband Kanye West.  

Actress Mindy Kaling also joined the discussion, writing on Twitter: 'IT'S A BLUE AND BLACK DRESS! ARE YOU F***ING KIDDING ME'.

Her friend and fellow actor BJ Novak replied: 'white and gold.' 

Then recent Oscar winner Julianne Moore jumped in, writing to Novak and Kaling; 'what's the matter with u guys, it's white and gold.' To that, Novak replied to Moore; 'Thank you!And congratulations on your Oscar, which Mindy thinks is purple and green.' 

And the hashtag #TheDress started trending worldwide on Twitter as the debate when global. There have been more than 1 million tweets mentioning the hashtag.

'Confused and scared': Taylor Swift told her Twitter followers that the dress is 'obviously blue and black'

Justin Bieber was one of the last celebrities to chime with his views on the dress on Twitter

Taylor Swift wrote: 'I don't understand this odd dress debate and I feel like it's a trick somehow.I'm confused and scared.PS it's OBVIOUSLY BLUE AND BLACK.'   

And Justin Bieber kept his fans happy by telling them that he sees 'blue and black'. 

Some celebrities avoided the issue completely, simply declaring that the dress was ugly. 

Model Chrissy Teigen told her 655,000 Twitter followers: 'F*** the dress it's heinous. While Oscar-winner Jared Leto branded it 'fugly'. 

McNeill said she never expected the picture to spark a star-studded debate, explaining that she just thought her followers on Tumblr would have a 'good reaction'. 

Despite the debate, the body-con dress is in fact royal blue with black lace detailing. 

It is made by British clothing company Roman Originals, which offers 'affordable women's clothing and designer ladies fashion.'

There are also white, pink and red options, all with black lace. Speaking on Friday, Ian Johnson, of Roman Originals, said: We were absolutely ecstatic about the reception of our fabulous blue and black dress. 

'We sold out within the first 30 minutes of sale and have since restocked all colours and sizes.'

The dress, in black and blue, is also for sale on Amazon, and Depop, and user comments have been just as amusing. 

'This dress made me lose all of my friends and now I am so lonely,' wrote one.

'Where's the white & gold option!? I KNOW IT EXISTS SOMEWHERE IT HAS TO,' said another. And now it does.
