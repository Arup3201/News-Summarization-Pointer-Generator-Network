An illegal immigrant who wants to serve in the military might seem an odd choice for a major national ad campaign.

But young Mexican-born Alejandro Morales seemed perfect to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg who picked him as the face of an ad pushing for immigration reform.

Zuckerberg now plans to run the video, entitled 'Serve', on cable outlets, the internet and in 13 major TV broadcast markets across the U.S.

Dreamer: Alejandro Morales, a young undocumented immigrant who was brought to the U.S. when he was seven months old, is to front Zuckerberg's ad campaign

The ad be backed up by a 'mid-six-figure ad buy,' a source close to the group told ABC News.

The pitch is part of the tech 
industry-backed FWD.us, a political action committee co-founded by the 29-year-old billionaire owner of the social network site that is devoted 
to immigration issues. 

It is the first to focus on the fight waged by 'Dreamers' for
immigration reform.

Its star, Morales, came to the United States illegally with his parents when he was seven months old and settled in Chicago.

He served in the Reserve Officers' Training Corps, or ROTC, in high school and earned the high ranking of Cadet Brigadier General during his senior year.

He cannot serve in the military, however, because of his immigration status.

'I do want to give back. I believe 100 percent in what this country stands for," Morales says in the ad. "Let me earn it. Let me serve.'

'We are running this ad to put a very human face on our broken immigration system,' said FWD.us President Joe Green, who co-founded FWD.us with Zuckerberg, in a statement.

'We hope that by showing Americans the cost of this broken system and the contributions people like Alejandro are already making, they will join with us in supporting real reform.'

Worthy: 'Serve', the advert highlighting Morales's story, is said to have cost a six-figure sum

Motivated: Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook CEO, co-founded the national campaign for immigration reform Fwd.us

Honour: The video describes how Morales became the highest ranking cadet in Chicago JROTC and wants to serve his county in the U.S. Marines

Justice: The campaign is seeking to change immigration laws in the U.S. to give long-term residents more rights

Noble: 'Serve' highlights how the Mexican-born soldier has already been decorated for services to the U.S. military

Opportunity: 'I just want a chance to show everyone out there that I am American', says Morales in the video

The ad strikes a notably different tone from
other ads backed by FWD.us.

The political advocacy group was embroiled 
in controversy earlier this year when it funded ads that touted the 
conservative bona fides of senators that support immigration reform, 
including Senators Lindsey Graham, Mark Begich and 
Marco Rubio.

The ad for Graham lauded his support of 
the Keystone XL pipeline, while the ad for Begich highlighted his 
support for drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Reserve.

The ad will run in TV broadcast markets in border states and large cities, such as Phoenix, Chicago and Washington, D.C.

The controversial ads prompted protests from environmentalists and progressive groups, who temporarily boycotted purchasing ads on Facebook.

Elon Musk, CEO of electric car maker Tesla, publicly quit FWD.us after the ads ran.

FWD.us, which has an A-list of tech donors, including Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer and Google Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt, has recently expanded its push for immigration reform beyond the tech industry's fight for more high-skilled visas and green cards for foreign graduates of American universities.

Earlier this week, it teamed up with journalist Jose Antonio Vargas's immigrant rights group Define American to cohost the premiere of 'Documented,' a film directed by Vargas that tells the stories of 'Dreamers' like himself who are fighting to gain U.S. citizenship.

Zuckerberg gave remarks at the film's premiere in San Francisco, which drew a crowd of tech executives, including Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg and Groupon founder Andrew Mason.

Wearing
his trademark hoodie and sneakers, he disputed the notion that 
he and other Silicon Valley leaders are just trying to secure more H1B 
visas for high-tech workers.

'This is something that we believe is really important for the future of our country - and for us to do what's right,'
Zuckerberg told several hundred attendees, including House Minority 
Leader Nancy Pelosi and San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee, at the Yerba Buena 
Center for the Arts.

Zuckerberg
and his former Harvard University roommate Joe Green recently founded 
the organization Fwd.us to advocate for a pathway to citizenship for 
nearly 11 million immigrants living in the U.S. illegally.

The screening was the first time Zuckerberg spoke about the issue in public.

The
Facebook Inc. founder said he first became aware of the need to change 
the immigration system while volunteering to teach a class on 
entrepreneurship at a Menlo Park school. Many of the students had been 
brought into the U.S. illegally.

'No
matter where they were born, (these students) are going to be 
tomorrow's entrepreneurs and people creating jobs in this country,' he told the audience.

'These are issues that don't just touch our part of the industry, but really touch a whole country.'

In April, Zuckerberg teamed up with other Silicon Valley leaders to launch Fwd.us, with the aim of revamping immigration policy, boosting education and encouraging investment in scientific research.

Website: Fwd.us, Zuckerberg said, was created 'to build 
the knowledge economy the United States needs to ensure more jobs, 
innovation and investment'.

'My great-grandparents came through Ellis Island.

'My grandfathers were a mailman and a police officer.

'My parents are doctors. I started a company.

'None of this could have happened without a welcoming immigration policy, a great education system and the world’s leading scientific community that created the internet.'

In an op-ed article in The Washington Post at
the time, Zuckerberg said the U.S. needs a new approach to these issues
if it is to get ahead economically. This, he wrote, includes offering 
talented, skilled immigrants a path to citizenship.

'We have a strange immigration policy for a nation of immigrants, Zuckerberg wrote. 'And it's a policy unfit for today's world.'

Of
Jewish extraction, Zuckerberg's interest in immigration stems from the 
fact that his own great-grandparents arrived as immigrants via Ellis 
Island, to America, coupled with his experience teaching 
entrepreneurship at an after-school program.

At the top of the Fwd.us website it explains in bite-sized facts just why immigration is important to the future of America and reminds users that: '40 per cent of Fortune 500 companies were founded by immigrants or their children' and that '57% of engineering grad students are immigrants. Many will have to leave if we don’t pass comprehensive immigration reform.'

Zuckerberg also called for higher standards and accountability in schools and increased focus on learning about science, technology, engineering and maths.

Today's knowledge and ideas-based economy, the 28-year-old Harvard dropout wrote, is very different from the economy of the 20th century that was based on natural resources, industrial machines and labor.

Fwd.us, he said, was created 'to build the knowledge economy the United States needs to ensure more jobs, innovation and investment.'

Also backing the group are tech leaders such as Bill Gates, LinkedIn CEO Reid Hoffman, serial entrepreneur Sean Parker, as well as Ruchi Sanghvi of Dropbox, who was Facebook's first female engineer.

Major contributors to the political group include Google Inc. chairman Eric Schmidt (left) and Yahoo Inc. CEO Marissa Mayer (right)
