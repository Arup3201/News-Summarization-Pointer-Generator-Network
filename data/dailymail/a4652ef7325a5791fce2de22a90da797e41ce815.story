Manchester United starlet James Wilson has not been included in the squad travelling down to play Southampton on Sunday.

The teenage striker scored a double on debut against Hull City on Tuesday at Old Trafford, but will be rested for an Under 21 fixture.

But Ryan Giggs has opted for alternatives for the St Mary's trip, with United aiming to finish a sorry season on a high.

Debut double: But James Wilson will not travel with the Manchester United squad to play Southampton on Sunday

Experience: Ryan Giggs has plenty of other striking options at his disposal for the trip on Sunday

Wilson also capped a successful week by winning the Jimmy Murphy Academy Player of the Year at the United club awards, but won't end it with another appearance.

Knowing there was little to play for apart from a Europa League place, Giggs played an inexperienced line-up against Hull on Tuesday.

Tom Lawrence also featured, but Wilson grabbed the attention with two striker's finishes.

And the the 18-year-old insisted there was more to come.

Speaking to the Daily Star, Wilson said: 'I feel like I can deal with the physicality and pace of the game. I just need to get as many games as possible under my belt for the experience.

'If you're getting on in the club, you have to be progressing so obviously scoring for every age group is a good sign. I've got to where I am now but I need to kick on.'
