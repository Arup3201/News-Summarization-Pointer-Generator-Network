It was one of the most popular TV series of its time and fans were devastated when it disappeared from their screens forever after just two seasons.

But two of Thunderbirds' most-loved characters made a welcome return to the capital earlier this week to celebrate the release of a new documentary film about the making of the cult 1960s series.

Aristocratic secret agent Lady Penelope Creighton-Ward and her loyal butler Aloysius Parker, two of the show's most popular puppets, were given a whistle-stop tour of some of London's top tourist sights, including Madame Tussauds, where Lady Penelope was granted a brief audience with 'Her Majesty the Queen' and given a chance to snuggle up to Hollywood heartthrob 'George Clooney'.

Filmed in Supermarionation gives Thunderbirds fans a chance to see how the popular series was filmed - and how the show's unique puppetry processes were first developed

The puppet pair, who also took the time to enjoy a trip on the London Eye, were helping to promote the newly-released Filmed in Supermarionation, a documentary  by British director Stephen La Riviere. It charts the TV successes of the late Thunderbirds creator Gerry Anderson, who died in 2012 aged 83 after being diagnosed with Alzheimer’s.

The film focuses on popular sci-fi series Thunderbirds and details the creation of Anderson's innovative supermarionation filming techniques, which were first made famous by the popular puppet series.

Supermarionation is a puppetry technique created in the 1960s. 

The technique relies on the use of lip-synched marionettes, controlled by supposedly invisible wire-pulling on 3D sets. 

It was first developed by Thunderbirds creator Gerry Anderson, his then-wife Sylvia and their film company AP Films. The technique was first made famous by the Thunderbirds series, which remains one of the most well-known supermarionation shows ever made.

The popular process has since been parodied in a variety of TV and film projects, including 2004 cult comedy film Team America.

Filmed in Supermarionation gives a unique behind-the-scenes insight into the development of the original thirty-two Thunderbirds episodes, which were first broadcast between 1965 and 1966. It features never-before-seen interviews with Gerry and his team of puppeteers, as well as a series of comical puppet 'blooopers'.

The two series of Thunderbirds, which has just celebrated its 50th anniversary, were filmed in Slough at a run-down warehouse studio Anderson soundproofed with 1,500 egg-boxes and it is here that much of the documentary footage is based.

The series told the story of the International Rescue team, a group of secret agents who flew mighty rockets from their secret Tracy Island refuge to save those in peril. 

Lady Penelope, who was frequently seen being driven around in a pink, six-wheeled Rolls-Royce by chauffeur Parker, served as the team's London field agent.

In the original series, the character was voiced by Anderson's then-wife Sylvia, who also was also credited with helping him to create and develop the show. Both creators feature heavily in the new documentary.

Filmed in Supermarionation also offers fans additional behind-the-scenes sneak peeks into some of Anderson's other more popular TV projects, including sci-fi series Joe 90 and Captain Scarlet.

But it is Thunderbirds that has remained Anderson's most popular supermarionation production. The sci-fi series has been adapted for the big screen three times - two puppet film sequels which were released in 1966 and 1968 and a live-action film adaptation which premiered in 2004 - and will soon return to our televisions in a new ITV series, Thunderbirds Are Go! 

The 26-part programme, which is due to air in Spring 2015, will feature the vocal talents of Gone Girl actress Rosamund Pike, 35, who will voice Lady Penelope, and Game of Thrones star Thomas Sangster, 24, who will play International Rescue team members Gordon and John Tracy.

Filmed in Supermarionation is out now on DVD, Blu-ray and Limited Edition Box Set #FiS
