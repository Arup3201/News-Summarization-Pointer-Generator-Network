Stars with a £133,000 Aston Martin have been told to return their vehicles over concerns that a fault in the heated seats could burn their bottoms.

The warning relates to thousands of the luxury supercars in the UK built over the last eight years, including the DB9 and DBS models often used by celebrities and footballers.

A safety alert warns drivers that a control mechanism for the front heated seats ‘may fail when the ignition is switched on’ and that this could lead to burns in ‘extreme circumstances’.

Celebrities believed to be fans of Aston Martins include footballer Frank Lampard, who has been pictured with a DB9 and Steven Gerrard’s wife Alex Curran.

The recall also affects the DBS model, used by Daniel Craig in the James Bond films Quantum of Solace and Casino Royale.

Footballers Gareth Barry, Glen Johnson, Peter Crouch and James Milner are also believed to be fans of the sports cars.

A recall notice on the European Commission website says: ‘The control module for the front heated seats may fail when the ignition is switched on.

‘This could allow a permanent feed to the seat heater element(s) and it may not be possible to switch off the heating.

‘This fault could cause the seat to overheat and in extreme circumstances the seat occupants may receive burns.’

According to the Sun, the warning relates to nearly 8,300 Aston Martins in Britain with the fault reported to be in cars built between June 15, 2006 and November 6, 2014. But this did not include the four-door Rapide, Rapide S and a newer version of the Vanquish.

The newspaper quotes a company spokesman as saying that the recall is ‘well underway’.

It is not the first time a recall has been issued for Aston Martin vehicles.

Last year, a notice was sent out recalling most of its sports cars built since late 2007 after it was revealed that a Chinese sub-supplier was using counterfeit plastic material in a part supplied to the luxury sports carmaker.

Aston Martin, which is owned by Kuwaiti and private equity investors, recalled 17,590 cars, including all of its left-hand-drive models built since November 2007 and all right-hand-drive models built since May 2012, affecting about 75 percent of all vehicles built in that period, a spokeswoman said at the time. The Vanquish was not affected.

MailOnline has contacted Aston Martin for further comment this morning.
