Heroic firefighters are usually pictured saving children or kittens, so this Chinese rescuer may have got the wrong end of the stick.

The man cradled a flaming propane tank in his arms to save it from destroying a restaurant.

In a surreal video, a second firefighter trailed behind with a limp hose but missed completely and doused his already distracted colleague with water.

Flaming mad: A Chinese firefighter carried this burning propane tank to save it from gutting a restaurant

Oops: A colleague trails behind with a hose - but misses completely at first and douses the man with water

The footage was reportedly shot in China and emerged on a Chinese TV station.

It was uploaded to YouTube and LiveLeak and has been viewed more than 25,000 times.

It shows the firefighter carrying the propane tank out of a restaurant, most likely to save it from setting the rest of the building on fire.

Crews linger inside among the tables as the flames light up the room before one firefighter - brave, stupid or both - takes the drastic action to bring it outside.

That is despite the fact the restaurant already appears to be severely damaged by fire.

Destroyed: From the video, the building already appeared to be damaged as the tank burned inside

All safe: The firefighters quickly regained control of the situation and two of them gripped the hose

The video provoked a storm of debate about firefighting tactics among online commenters.

One said: 'Bravery would be charging into a burning building to save orphans. Stupidity would be hand-carrying a flaming propane tank to save what appears to be a fire-gutted restaurant.'

But another pointed out the valves fitted to propane canisters would mean the firefighter was relatively safe.

The viewer wrote: 'The tank can't blow, as the gas keeps being pushed out by the pressure, meaning the fire can't get in the tank through the valve.'
