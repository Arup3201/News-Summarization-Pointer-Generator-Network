A-list celebrities from Robert De Niro to Russell Brand agreed to play a surreal game of hide and seek for these quirky portraits.

Photographer Chris Buck invited famous subjects used to being the centre of attention to conceal themselves for 30 seconds while he took their picture.

They each signed a statement swearing that they were genuinely in the frame - even if they are nearly impossible to spot.

Buck wanted to take the photos where the celebrities could not be seen as a subversive re-think on the public's love of viewing famous people.

His first photograph was of Star Trek actor William Shatner, whom he was photographing on location. It was Shatner's idea to head for a barn on set, where he hid in the hay bales and sawdust. 

Many of the celebrities he shot on location such as talk show host Jay Leno, who hid outside the studio where he tapes his programme, and star of The Office: An American Workplace Rainn Wilson.

Snoop Dogg is perhaps the most humorous portrait because it is posed near his 'man cave' with a fluffy white dog seeming to guard the entrance.

Where's the host?: TV star Jay Leno is not usually so shy and retiring

Knowing me, knowing you: Alan Partridge actor Steve Coogan is somewhere in this office block scene

Eerily empty: Horror director Wes Craven is lurking somewhere in this office

At the hairdressers: Lots of faces on the wall, but where is REM singer Michael Stipe?

Actor Russell Brand was particularly enthusiastic about the idea and spent a lot of time hiding in the lobby of The Plaza Hotel in New York City for his portrait.

Chris Buck collected them together for his book Presence.

The book features fifty sittings including an eclectic line-up of Chevy Chase, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Nick Cave and David Lynch.

Canadian-born Buck’s career spans more than two decades.

Recently he was honoured to take an official picture of President Barack Obama.

A ghost at the feast: There is no sign of comedian Sarah Silverman at the table - or is there?

'People told me they were looking forward to his (Obama’s) Presence photo,' Buck told slate.com.

'He worked hard to be president twice—he’s not hiding anytime soon.'

In keeping with his interest in 
unusual takes on famous people, Buck recently brought out a book called 
'Isn't' featuring celebrity lookalikes.

The pictures played mischeviously on the personas of icons like Madonna, Tom Cruise, Bill Gates and George W. Bush.

Next year he will release a series 
he has been working on for the past 12 years—documenting meeting other 
people called Christopher Buck.
