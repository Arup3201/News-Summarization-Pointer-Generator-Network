The man charged with the murder of Alexander Litvinenko is working as a consultant on a Russian TV show about the death of the former KGB agent. 

Alexander Litvinenko died in London in 2006, aged 44, after drinking tea laced with radioactive polonium-210.

Andrey Luguvoy, 50, was identified as one of the two Russian men who had met Litvinenko for tea, and was charged with his murder by the British CPS in 2007. 

Andrei Lugovoy, was charged with murder over the poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko in London in 2006, but Russia refused to extradite him, and he has now helped a TV team on a show about the killing

However, Moscow refused to extradite Lugovoy to Britain, and the businessman and former KGB bodyguard was instead elected to the lower chamber of the Russian parliament, the State Duma, where he still sits.

Now, eight years after Litvinenko's death, a Russian production company is making a TV series based on his murder, and Lugovoy has been hired as a consultant on the show. 

Lugovoy has been brought in to share his memories of the meeting with Litvinenko, where he was served the poisoned tea, the studio, Central Partnership, said in a statement.

Lugovoy will be consulting the actors and the director of the miniseries, and has helped the screenwriter with the script, the production company said.

Central Partnership quoted Lugovoy as saying he chose a Russian company after being approached by foreign studios he didn't trust. 

Murdered: Alexander Litvinenko, former Russian security agent, was poisoned using tea laced with radioactive polonium-210,  in London in November 2006, and died shortly afterwards, aged 44

He sure looks the part... Lugovoy is seen with a body guard in 2007, shortly after British CPS sent Moscow an extradition request over the Litvinenko murder charge

Effects: Litvinenko before he was poisoned, left, and after, photographed in his hospital bed at University College Hospital in central London shortly before he died

'I made a conscious decision to turn down all of them because I understood that none of them were able to tell this Russian story truthfully because of a different mentality,' Lugovoy said in the statement.

An inquest into Litvinenko's death stalled over authorities' reluctance to disclose secret intelligence evidence. But in July Britain announced a public inquiry into the death.

Lawyers for Litvinenko's family said he was working for MI6, Britain's foreign intelligence agency, at the time of his death.

The case soured British-Russian relations for years, leading both sides to expel diplomats.

Those lingering political tensions worsened recently as Britain and other Western powers accused Russia of fomenting unrest in Ukraine and being complicit in the downing of a Malaysia Airlines jet over eastern Ukraine.

Britain, along with France and Germany, has been pushing for harsher sanctions on Russia.
