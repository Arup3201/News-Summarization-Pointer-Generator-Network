In her latest rant, controversial wannabe glamour model Josie Cunningham, 24, launched a scathing attack on Christians, calling them 'gullible'

NHS boob-job scrounger Josie Cunningham has launched a scathing attack on Christianity by calling the Virgin Mary a 'slut' who 'blates had it off with one of the three kings behind the stable'.

In her latest rant, the 24-year-old, who shot to notoriety after boasting about having a £4,800 breast enlargement on the NHS, also called Christians 'gullible' for believing the Old Testament.

She then turned on one of the religion's most sacred figures, before suggesting the immaculate conception was better suited to the Jeremy Kyle show.

She tweeted: 'Christians are so gullible! Virgin Mary my arse, more like "Slut Mary". She Blates had it off with one of the three kings behind the stable.'

The mother-of-three then added: 'If I tried to claim I had an immaculate conception you would ship me straight off to the Jeremy Kyle show!'

As is par for the course with Miss Cunningham's outbursts, it was only a matter of minutes before angry Twitter users responded in a backlash, with one replying: 'Anyone who uses the word 'Blates' does not have the intelligence to have any kind of opinion on anything.' 

Another said: 'You clearly don't know how contraception works,' while others said she would 'never be welcome' on the Jeremy Kyle show.

But the ITV chat show soon caught wind of the discussion and appeared to suggest she would be welcome on the show, saying: 'well, well, well...'

The controversial wannabe glamour model, who recently appeared in a documentary entitled: 'The most hated woman in Britain?', has previously offended different groups with her outspoken comments.

During the two-minute silence on Armistice Day, she tweeted: 'I wanna scream, and shout, and let it all out!!!!! **waves hands in the air like a mad man**'.

She also slammed breastfeeding as 'borderline incest'. 

Miss Cunningham became infamous after having a boob enhancement operation, funded by taxpayers, to increase her breasts from a 32A to a 36DD. 

She has since continued to make headlines, even starring in her own real-life documentary earlier this month, which showed Miss Cunningham  revelling in attention from paparazzi and members of the public.

She had previously revealed how she had become engaged by sharing a photo of her pink heart-shaped engagement ring online, but Miss Cunningham is now said to be single.

The  boob-job scrounger recently appeared in a documentary called Josie: The Most Hated Woman in Britain?

Today's episode is the latest in a long line of controversial statements which the mother-of-three has shared with her 108,000 Twitter followers. 

Last November, Miss Cunningham revealed to her followers how she had wrongly told one man that he was the father of her baby daughter Grace by sending him the wrong DNA result.

She had asked three men to take a paternity test to determine who was Grace's father and wrote the outcome in cards to be delivered in time for Christmas Day.

But she allegedly mixed up the notes and sent the positive result to the wrong man. 

Miss Cunningham's latest outburst attacked Christians and one of the most sacred figures in its religion 

The former escort, from Leeds (pictured heavily pregnant last year), told Twitter followers that she would be 'shipped off to the Jeremy Kyle show' if she claimed to have had an immaculate conception

Miss Cunningham shared her blunder with her Twitter followers before comparing her life to an episode of EastEnders.

But her most controversial outburst came when she publicly considered aborting the child because the pregnancy prevented her from appearing on Channel 5's Big Brother.

However, she later claimed she 'changed her mind' after discovering her baby was to be a little girl. 

She later said she was receiving negative attention on public transport and asked the council to provide her with a £6,000-a-year taxi to take her children to school.

It wasn't long before dozens of people created a backlash on Twitter, questioning Miss Cunningham's views

The former escort made headlines again when she said she wanted a nose job - funded by the public.

She set up a website called fundmynose.co.uk to encourage people to donate towards the £3,000 cosmetic operation. 

Towards the end of last year, the controversial wannabe glamour model stepped out with a Girl Power painting sprawled over her heavily pregnant bump, before announcing she would be setting up a trust fund to pay for her daughter's boob job.

She decided to sell tickets to the live birth of her child. Four tickets to the home birth had sold out in just 14 minutes - netting her £30,000. But she later cancelled the event.
