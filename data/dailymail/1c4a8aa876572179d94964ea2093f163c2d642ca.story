A three year old was left alone in a pre-school for almost two hours after staff forgot to take her on a class trip to the woods. 

The girl's parents said they were extremely concerned when they learnt of the incident because the toddler has a pre-existing condition which affects the structure of her skull and makes her incredibly vulnerable if she falls or has an accident. 

Staff at Sydling Springs Pre-School, in Sydling St Nicholas, Dorset, did not notice the child, who is not being identified, was missing until they returned to the building from the trip to nearby woods. 

An Ofsted inspection following the incident found that registers were not being completed properly, meaning staff had no accurate record of the number of children being taken on trips. 

Sydling St Nicholas Village Hall, where the three year old was left to run around the pre-school 

 While her classmates were out the child had the run of the village hall school. 

Her mother said it was extremely lucky her daughter was not harmed during the incident that happened on September 22 this year.

The child's mother, who has two other children, said: 'There was a very small group of children there. How could they have missed her? 

'We are really grateful that she wasn't hurt, but who knows what could have happened.

'If she had fallen or hit her head it could have been catastrophic. I just don't want it to happen again.'

She added: 'I have received a letter from the pre-school committee which says they will be investigating the incident but that any disciplinary action taken will not be divulged to us because of confidentiality. 

Headquarters of Dorset County Council where councillors say they are helping the school address the issue

The woman made a complaint to Ofsted which carried out an unannounced inspection days later.

Inspectors found that there were no risk assessments in place ahead of such trips and that registers were not completed correctly to provide an accurate record of the number of children present.

No member of staff at the pre-school has lost their job over it.

Ofsted inspectors have served the pre-school with a welfare requirement notice, which demands they introduce a series measures to ensure there is no repeat of the incident. This is enforceable by law. 

One of those is to ensure that while children are on and off the premises they are accounted for at all times.

Hannah Tippett, chairman of Sydling Springs Pre-School, said the staff involved in the incident remained in their positions.

She said: 'Following Ofsted's recommendations and results of the pre-school committee's own internal investigation, the pre-school immediately implemented measures to ensure such an incident cannot re-occur.

'We take this opportunity to thank parents for their incredible ongoing support at this time.'

According the Ofsted's most recent routine inspection report, the pre-school caters for a maximum of 22 children.

A spokesman for Dorset County Council said: 'The pre-school leader of Sydling Springs contacted the council's early years team with a report of a safeguarding issue.

'So far, we have supported Sydling Springs by helping them address the actions set out in Ofsted's compliance notice. We have also put in place a number of actions for the pre-school to adopt to ensure this never happens again.'
