Ryam Schmidt's wife - who is not named in the video - was covered in pus

This is the stomach churning moment a loving wife goes above and beyond the call of duty - and gets hit with flying pus from her husband's 32-year-old cyst.

Ryan Schmidt's poor wife - who is not named in the video - is on hand to help out as he squeezes the pus-filled cyst.

But what neither of them were expecting was the force with which 32 years of pressure would release from Mr Schmidt's leg.

 After a few squeezes producing not much, Mr Schmidt encourages his wife, who is holding the camera, to 'get up close on it'.

Less than a second later, a stream of flying pus rockets from his leg - hitting his phone, and his screaming wife.

Worse, after the first stream of putrid liquid, Mr Schmidt continues to squeeze, so it can only be assumed his very patient wife continued to be covered in the yellow pus.

 But he doesn't seem to worried.

'Wow, oh my God,' he is heard saying. 'It sprayed everywhere. I don't even know what to say right now.'

Initially, his wife - dressed in an appropriate 'beginners luck' t-shirt - seems more worried about his phone, before taking a closer look at her arms. 

'God, this is horrible," Mr Schmidt finally concedes, before adding: 'It's not done either.

'What is this thing?'

But, despite his disgust, he isn't to be put off from filming the aftermath - asking his wife to go and get the camera.

The disgusting explosion was caught on camera - and then uploaded to YouTube

 'Get your phone and look at this,'he can be heard saying on the video, which has been viewed more than 110,000 times.

When his wife returns, he finally reveals the true carnage: a covering of lumpy pus on the phone the couple were filming with. 

And finally, he manages to apologise to his wife, who is seen mopping the floor with a tissue.

'Sorry babe,' Mr Schmidt says.

But remorse doesn't seem to last long.

'This is the greatest day of my life,' he says.

This is the latest in a line of 'spot' videos which have both disgusted and enthralled the internet in recent months.

Andy Peppers - a pseudonym - possibly produced the most revolting video of the year, when he filmed the squeezing of a spot on his neck

Like Mr Schmidt, he also roped his poor wife in to help.

Mr Peppers told MailOnline he decided to get squeezing after noticing whiteheads appearing, and the spot starting to hurt.

And despite it looking quite horrendous, it didn't hurt at all.  

‘'It just felt like pressure releasing,' he said.

‘Once a significant amount of stuff had come out, it felt way better, and soon stopped hurting altogether.’
