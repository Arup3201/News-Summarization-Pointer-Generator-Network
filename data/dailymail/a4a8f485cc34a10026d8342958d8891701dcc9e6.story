John Stones will be given a shock call-up to England’s World Cup squad if injury shatters Phil Jones’s dream of going to Brazil.

The Everton defender made his Barclays Premier League debut only last September and has not figured in any of the squads Roy Hodgson has named this season.

But he has starred for the Under 21s and Sportsmail understands that Hodgson will turn to the 19-year-old if Jones is ruled out. Only 18 months ago, Stones was playing for his hometown club Barnsley before moving to Everton for £2million.

Jones was forced off early during Manchester United’s 3-1 win over Hull on Tuesday with a serious shoulder problem. His club have yet to release an official bulletin on the damage but it was initially suspected to be a dislocation. United caretaker manager Ryan Giggs said after the game ‘it didn’t look good’.

Hodgson, who will unveil his  23-man party on Monday, watched Stones in action at Goodison Park last weekend when Everton were beaten 3-2 by Manchester City. Former England striker Gary Lineker has urged Hodgson to take the gamble on Stones. ‘I really like him,’ said Lineker.

‘He has got a lot about him. Sometimes central defenders need a bit more experience because of the extra discipline and nature of that role. But is he worth a gamble? Well, if Jones doesn’t make it — what else have we got?’

Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has admitted the next few days will determine if Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain will be fit for the World Cup.

That's torn it! Phil Jones (C) is waiting on results after appearing to dislocate his shoulder against Hull

Oxlade-Chamberlain returned to Arsenal 
training yesterday and came through unscathed, but he is still troubled 
by a groin problem.

Wenger is not counting on him for the FA Cup final on Saturday week and admits he will have to rule the 20-year-old midfielder out of Brazil if the problem flares up.

‘His time is getting short now but I am still convinced he can do it if he gets over the next hurdle,’ said Wenger. ‘It is inflamed. I don’t believe he will need surgery. We will stop him before that. If he gets over the next three or four days and he has no pain, he will be available for Brazil. If he doesn’t, it becomes more doubtful.

Will they, won't they? North London rivals Jack Wilshere (L) and Kyle Walker (R) are England's other doubts

‘He is desperate to go but we are in a job where your body responds or it doesn’t. He can only go to the World Cup if he is completely fit. It wouldn’t be helpful for England for him to go there and not be 100 per cent.’

It would be a huge blow for Hodgson, who has already lost wingers Theo Walcott, Andros Townsend and Jay Rodriguez to injuries.

Hodgson has other concerns. Jack Wilshere, out with an ankle injury since March, is expected to return to the Arsenal squad for Sunday’s game at Norwich, but is not certain to start. And Spurs right back Kyle Walker, who has been out for two months with a groin injury, is not likely to feature in their final game of the season.

Meanwhile, former England manager Glenn Hoddle has backed Sportsmail’s campaign calling for Hodgson to unleash the young Lions.

Hoddle, who was speaking at a World Cup event for Continental Tyres, said: ‘We have seen some electrifying prospects over the years. I was very fortunate to have a young Michael Owen, Rio Ferdinand, Paul Scholes and David Beckham. They were four fantastic players.

‘Did they know everything then? No. Were they as good then as they eventually became? No. They grew and gained experience.

‘Sterling, Lallana and Shaw will be so much better for the experience of going to the World Cup.’
