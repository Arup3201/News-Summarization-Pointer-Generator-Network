ENGLAND'S oaks could be the next trees to fall victim to diseases threatening our countryside, experts have warned.

They say that oaks are 'under 
assault' from at least two new infections, with up to half of the trees 
in some forests displaying signs of disease.

The warning comes after the 
Government's chief scientist said it could be too late to stop the 
spread of ash dieback, a fungal  disease threatening 80 million ash 
trees.

Under threat: Experts have already warned that the battle against the ash dieback could already be lost, with the killer fungus that causes it now discovered in 30 sites in the UK

The study, published yesterday by 
the Countryside Restoration Trust, reveals how Britain's woodlands are 
under threat from pests and diseases.

It warns horse chestnuts are at risk
from a disease called bleeding canker, and the London skyline could be 
changed by 'plane wilt', which threatens plane trees

These are found in many cities 
because of their resistance to pollution. In total, 25 new pests and 
diseases are either already established, recently arriving, on their way
or seen as likely threats to Britain's trees, woods and forests.

The report warns: 'Even English oaks 
are in trouble, declining under assault from two new, as yet 
incompletely understood conditions.'

The oak – our most common woodland 
tree which is often used as a symbol for England – is threatened by two 
of the top five diseases; 'acute and chronic oak decline', and the 'oak 
processionary moth'.

Peter Goodwin, of Woodland  Heritage,
said of acute oak decline: 'Its impact is going to be far greater than 
that of ash dieback.

There is not a forester in Britain 
who is not terrified of this one.

'The oak is the country's dominant 
tree because of its size, importance and history. We really could lose 
it because there is not a cure.'

The other danger is from the oak processionary moth, first reported in south-west London in 2006.

The report said: 'While the 
caterpillars of the moth can strip trees bare of their leaves, the key 
concern is the caterpillar's hairs, which can cause severe allergic, 
potentially fatal reactions in people and animals.'

Dr Keith Kirby, a woodland ecologist 
from Oxford University, said the future of our oaks was at a 
'crossroads' because of the threat from acute oak decline.

'What is particularly concerning is the disease has attacked old trees,' he added.

'If it takes out younger trees it 
does not matter too much, but if it takes out 300-year-old ones, they 
take longer to replace and support more insects.'

Tory MP Zac Goldsmith, who  co-wrote 
the study, said: 'We are seeing a torrent of new pests and diseases, the
majority imported accidentally, threatening our iconic and much-loved 
native trees.'
