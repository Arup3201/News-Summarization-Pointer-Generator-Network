Tony Abbott's government continues to languish behind the Labor Opposition, with the latest Newspoll showing the public would turf the government out in a landslide if an election was held today.

The Newspoll, published in today's  The Australian, shows that despite a tiny one per cent gain in the Coalition's primary vote in the last fortnight, Tony Abbott's government remains deeply unpopular with the electorate.

The government's fortunes took a turn for the worst with the release of the May 13 Budget, which included cuts to welfare spending, schools and hospitals.

When elected in September, the Coalition's primary vote was 45.6 per cent, but now it has fallen to just 36 per cent. Labor's primary vote in the September election was just 33.3 per cent, but has now risen under Opposition Leader Bill Shorten to 12.3 per cent.

Surveys conducted by The Australian have revealed that the Labor party continues to be favoured by Australians two months after the governments budget release

Newspoll figures show that until May 4, voters favoured the elected government by at least 4 per cent.

But surveys carried out from May 16 right up until Sunday, show a swing in the opposite direction.

In the two-party preferred poll, support for the Liberal party has dropped down to 46 per cent while Labor is favoured by 54 per cent of voters, as of July 13.

Newspoll also shows voters continue to prefer BIll Shorten over Tony Abbott as Prime Minister.

A survey asking readers to determine the better prime minister out of the two parties leaders, also shows that the majority choose Bill Shorten over Tony Abbott by 5 per cent

The Newspoll findings come as phone polling carried out across the country revealed the unpopularity of the government's higher education cuts, according to the Sydney Morning Herald.

The survey found 69 per cent of those surveyed opposed increases in university fees while 65 per cent disagreed with the Abbott Government's 20 per cent public funding cut to university courses.

Higher education cuts top the list of policies that voters are most unhappy about, according to the Sydney Morning Herald which found that 69 per cent of those surveyed oppose the increases in university fees

The survey also found 46 per cent were opposed to government funding for privately-owned universities, with only 28 per cent in support.

The voter's dislike at the proposed cuts can also be clearly seen in the drop in support for federal Education Minister Christopher Pyne, according to the Sydney Morning Herald.

Mr Pyne's support has fallen by 13 per cent since last September's election, putting him at risk of losing his seat of Sturt in Adelaide’s eastern suburbs.

Meanwhile, the Newspoll also found the majority of voters wanted the carbon tax scrapped.

The poll found 53 per cent of voters want the Palmer United Party (PUP) to support the repeal bills, while 35 per cent want the party to vote against them.

The latest survey was conducted after the proposal to axe the controversial carbon tax was blocked by PUP senators on Thursday.

The federal government has since been in talks with PUP staff to discuss further changes to the bills, ahead of it going back to the lower house on Monday.

Mr Abbott has said he is still committed to abolishing the tax.

The Newspoll of 1207 voters taken on Friday, Saturday and Sunday also shows 85 per cent of coalition supporters want the carbon tax scrapped immediately, while eight per cent want it to remain and seven per cent are undecided.

About 30 per cent of Labor supporters also want the tax's imminent removal, though the majority, 53 per cent, want Palmer United to block the bills.
