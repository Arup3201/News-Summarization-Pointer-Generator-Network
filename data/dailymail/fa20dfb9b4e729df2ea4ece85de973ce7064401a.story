How would you go about renovating Stonehenge? Ian Berg took on a task of almost that size in 2010 when he bought Lendal Tower in York, an Ancient Scheduled Monument.

The 700-year-old tower had been derelict for more than a decade when Mr Berg, a veteran of many conversions, decided to turn it into a modern home – and bravely entered into battle with a small army of bureaucrats intent on preserving as much of the tower as possible.

‘It looked in a sorry state when I first saw it,’ says the 47-year-old human resources consultant. ‘The roof was leaking and the windows were smashed. It had been left to rot, damp and pigeons. But I knew it was something special.’

High achiever: Ian Berg succeeded in the daunting task of restoring the 14th century Lendal Tower in York, and is now selling it for £1.35million

If location is everything, then it will be hard to find a better home in York. Built as part of the city’s medieval defences in 1299, on top of city foundations laid down by the Roman Emperor Severus, the tower sits on the eastern bank of the Ouse, alongside Lendal Bridge, and commands astonishing views of the river and city, including York Minster and the ruins of St Mary’s Abbey.

With more than 2,500 sq ft of living space on three floors, including three bedrooms, three bathrooms and a roof terrace – you even get your own flagpole – Lendal Tower is now on the market for £1.35 million through Carter Jonas estate agency.

Being a monument may have been its attraction for Ian Berg, but it also quickly proved to be its major drawback. Given its historic and cultural importance, there were as many restrictions on what could be renovated as there were things to repair – and several different agencies to deal with.

‘There was York City Council, English Heritage, planning officers, conservation officers, building regulations,’ he recalls. ‘The red tape was astonishing, but I’m lucky that negotiating with people is part of my job. The important thing is to have a vision, and to work towards that.’

After its time protecting the city from invaders and tax-evaders – a great chain was stretched across the Ouse from Lendal Tower to Barker Tower on the opposite shore, to keep the enemy out and make sure visitors paid a toll – in 1677 the tower was leased to what would become the York Waterworks Company, and used as a pumping station.

A donkey used to power the pump, tramping around the circular living room. If the animal was sick, prisoners would be drafted in to do the donkey work.

In 1836, a dedicated engine house was built, requiring Queen Victoria to sign an Act of Parliament decommissioning Lendal Tower.

After that it became the York Waterworks Company’s headquarters and, to make it worthy of its high-profile visitors, oak panelling, decoratively plastered ceilings and a Pickerings lift were added. An expert called in by Mr Berg to assess the lift found it to be in amazingly good working order – it had been used only twice a month to ferry executives to their meetings in the top-floor boardroom.

Mr Berg was obliged to run everything past the various agencies to ensure as sympathetic a renovation as possible. Everything from wood (oak for ceiling beams, Scandinavian pine for upper floors) and radiators (cast iron) to windows and the colour of lime-washed walls had to be given the green light. In York, there was no shortage of master craftsmen, stonemasons, glaziers and carpenters to help him do the job.

Clever use has been made of the building’s unusual shape. Oak columns in the high-ceilinged living room support a mezzanine office/bedroom, utilising the dead space above and creating the feeling of a cosy farmhouse below. Opposite the lift on the ground floor are what appear to be large oak cabinets, actually a modern bathroom worthy of a high-class hotel.

Having defended a city and watered its inhabitants, Lendal Tower’s current incarnation as a family home could be considered a form of retirement. If so, it’s certainly a comfortable one. The 4ft-thick walls lock in the warmth from underfloor heating and keep the noise out to such an extent that it’s difficult to believe you’re in the middle of a city.

And its security is second to none: in its 700 years it has withstood attack by rebel barons, Oliver Cromwell’s roundheads and the Luftwaffe. Workmen discovered shrapnel damage from German bombs while repairing the roof.

The renovations cost £200,000 alone, Mr Berg says, and took him 12 months – not bad considering the complexity of the project. Louise Hirst of Carter Jonas says location is as important when it comes to buying a medieval tower as it is with any other home. ‘You’d expect a piece of history like this to stand atop a grassy knoll. Instead, it’s in the heart of York,’ she says.

Mr Berg is selling up because his job means he is spending little time in York these days, but he takes great pleasure in having brought Lendal Tower back to life. ‘The tower has stood for more than 700 years. I feel I’ve brought it up to standard and there’s no reason it can’t survive for another 700 years. It’s an incredible place and I’m very proud to have been part of its long and illustrious history.’
