A vigilante gang kidnapped two alleged fraudsters and threatened them with a hammer, knife and hot iron to try to get them to return money. 

The victims were taken to a house in Cheetham Hill, Manchester, where members of the group beat them overnight in a 'terrifying' hold up. 

Seven men, led by 44-year-old Tariq Dhumial, were jailed after forcing the men into transferring thousands of pounds into their bank accounts.

Dhumial, the court heard, believed a previous failed business deal with the two victims had been fraudulent. 

With his fellow offenders, he duped the victims into meeting him at a property they thought was for sale when they attacked. 

Beating the men, they took a wallet, watch, bracelet, phone and keys from one man. Both hostages were told to phone their wives and arrange for bank transfers of £5,000 and £9,000.  

Dhamial, who was described by prosecutors as the 'leader' of the group was sentenced at Manchester Crown Court to four years in prison.

Fateh Kashief Ahmed, 47, Shakoor Ahmed Butt, 35, Shazwan Ashraf, 31, Ghulam Ali, 33, and Abdul Zubair Qadus, 33, were each sentenced to 32 months, while Mohammed Khateer Ali, 31, was sentenced to 27 months.

Senior investigating officer Duncan Thorpe, from GMP, said: 'The victims were severely beaten and threatened for money that the offenders believed was owed to them from a previous fraud.

'A separate investigation is being conducted in relation to the fraudulent activities of the two victims, but unfortunately the offenders in this case decided to take matters into their own hands and inflict violence upon the victims.

'They kept the two victims prisoner for a couple of days and this was clearly a terrifying experience for both men, but today justice has been done.'

Rob Hall, of the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), said: 'Tariq Dhamial was the leader in the false imprisonment of two men after a business deal went wrong.

'The two complainants were physically assaulted and threatened with demands for money being made directly to their families on mobile phones.

'The defendants initially denied all offences but eventually admitted falsely imprisoning the two men on the day of their trial. 

'The message is clear that this behaviour will not be tolerated. 

'Today, as these men begin prison sentences, they must face up to the consequences of their unacceptable actions.'
