With many feeling the pinch after Christmas, those looking to get a holiday booked can forget about having to save to visit far-flung idyllic islands for a dose indulgence.

On the shores of Torquay, Devon, a hotel tycoon has revealed £1.5m plans to build a series of luxury beach huts, complete with all the added extras.

Peter de Savary and his wife Lana have submitted the plans to build the six huts alongside their boutique hotel, The Cary Arms Hotel in Torquay.

The huts, which will overlook the picturesque Babbacombe Beach, are set to feature their own TV lounge, en suite bathroom and a separate bedroom.

Guests will also be able to enjoy the use of a gym, spa, plunge pool and three waterside relaxation rooms.

Mr de Savary said he believes the holiday cottages will offer 'unparalleled luxury' and 'breathtaking views' of the English Riviera.

The planning application was submitted to Torbay Council in December and the plans are now awaiting approval.

The idea was originally put on hold after the effects of the recession began to bite.

But managing director of De Savary Hotels, Ian Solkin, said they now have sufficient confidence in the economy to push ahead with their plans.

While traditional in style, the new beach huts will have a large lounge area with an outside deck under a canopy.

A mezzanine floor will provide a separate bedroom for two people and pull-down beds will be available for children.

Mr Solkin said: 'We think they will be a really fun, unique style of accommodation.'
