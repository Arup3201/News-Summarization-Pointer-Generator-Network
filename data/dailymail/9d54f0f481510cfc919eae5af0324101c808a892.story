It has never been easy to fathom the inner workings of Lewis Hamilton’s mind, yet it has rarely been harder, or more pertinent, to do so than here in the dry heat of the desert.

There was a growing consensus among us amateur paddock psychologists that almost the only man who can beat Hamilton in the title-deciding Abu Dhabi Grand Prix is Hamilton himself.

Of course, Nico Rosberg, his Mercedes team-mate, must play his part. He must finish fifth to stand any chance at all of closing the 17-point gap to Hamilton. Even if Rosberg were to win, second would be enough for Hamilton to take the title. If Rosberg were second, Hamilton would need to be fifth etc, etc.

The permutations are extensive, and that is at the root of the fear some of us feel for the British driver as he goes into the biggest weekend of his life — since the last one. That was in 2008, when he fought a tactical race and emerged victorious, a touch fortuitously by passing Timo Glock on the last lap to finish fifth and clinch the title.

Again, his task is less clear than that of his opponent — Felipe Massa six years ago and Rosberg here. Hamilton is facing Formula One’s equivalent of defending a 1-0 lead in football for 90 minutes, the approximate duration of Sunday’s race that starts at dusk and finishes in the dark.

Hamilton is a super-accomplished driver, of course, but part of his brilliance is binary: everything or nothing, win at all costs, high-risk overtaking without a care in the world.

The dynamics of Sunday mean the psychological advantage has shifted quite markedly. Rosberg, the impressive winner of the last race in Interlagos, realised this sooner than anyone and arrived in his press briefing, his shoulders back and his head up, talking about piling pressure on Hamilton.

That strain is all the greater for the Briton because of the extraordinary expectations he and the watching public bestowed upon him when he arrived in F1 as a rookie of dazzling gifts.

If he should flunk it on Sunday — or his Mercedes car betrays him — the script he wrote for himself would be ripped up.

If he wins he will become the first British double world champion since Jackie Stewart in 1971, and who is to say what more records may not fall to him. The dichotomy between success and failure is chilling.

It is said that this is Rosberg’s only chance of the title his father, Keke, won in 1982. That is not necessarily so, but, still, being so close to a lifetime’s dream carries a burden that must, however fleetingly, interrupt his customarily long hours of sleep.

The task of managing the two protagonists has fallen to Toto Wolff, the head of Mercedes. He will not issue his men with any team orders. They will be free to race.

Wolff was relaxed in the paddock of this £800million confection of Yas Marina, but his insight was illuminating.

‘Neither is an easy individual,’ he said, approvingly. ‘They are both complex characters.’

I suggested that Rosberg, despite the polished demeanour of a blue-chip company’s dream, has a bit of menace in him.

‘Ruthless, ruthless,’ said Wolff. ‘That boy, Nico, knows what he wants. Sometimes you say you need a difficult upbringing in order to be competitive. He had it all: son of a world champion, raised in Monaco, went to the international school. You can’t imagine a better family environment than that, and still, against the odds, he is an extremely competitive person.’

And Hamilton? ‘I have been almost blown away by Lewis’s development in the last year-and-a-half, as a personality. He came from this McLaren environment which had two sides to it.

‘On one side he had a very long relationship with a father figure in Ron Dennis, being raised in the team, and owing it all to them. And on the other side he felt he needed to emancipate himself.

‘He came to us and it was all new. Over the course of time, his trust in the team grew, relationships started to be established.

‘He has a solid private life. For a couple of months he has been almost invulnerable. Not unbeatable on track, but as a person. He has a bad session and, because he wears his heart on his sleeve, he’s down. But you see him half an hour later and he is back. He wasn’t like this before.’

There is a persuasive argument that Hamilton, who was so marginally quicker than Rosberg in practice on Friday that it was hardly material, deserves the title more than his rival because he has won the majority of races — 10 wins to five so far — and is the purer racer. 

But if Rosberg holds his nerve and Hamilton wobbles in the final character examination here on Sunday who could begrudge him the title?

Two final thoughts. First, let’s hope — putting sporting fairness ahead of patriotism — that the arbitrary double scoring that has been introduced for this race does not distort the championship.

Secondly, what chance a Jean-Louis Schlesser having an impact on the title? The Frenchman was a hopeless backmarker who took out Ayrton Senna at Monza in 1988, spoiling McLaren’s 100 per cent winning record. Dennis said Schlesser ruined his life.

So Lewis, our British hope, beware slow-moving vehicles, don’t be frozen by tactical cul-de sacs, be blessed with technical reliability, and the title will be yours.

If Hamilton wobbles and Rosberg holds his nerve, then the title could go to the latter instead of the Brit
