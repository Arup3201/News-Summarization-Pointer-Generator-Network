It's synonymous with rock chicks and is a fabric beloved of the style set - but you don't often see a royal stepping out in leather.

One who does is Spain's Queen Letizia who stepped out in a fitted burgundy dress crafted from the fabric in Madrid today.

But in true royal style, what could have been a risqué look was toned down with one of the 42-year-old's trademark tailored jackets.

Glamorous: Letizia opted for a burgundy leather dress for her meeting in Madrid today

The more serious approach to dressing was echoed in the theme of the day's events, with the royal on businesslike form for a meeting with the board of the Royal Council on Disability.

One of Letizia's favoured causes, the mother-of-two appeared deep in concentration as she listened to the points raised by her fellow board members.

The visit was the first outing of the week for Letizia, who spent much of last week championing another of her favoured causes - Spanish culture.

That saw her travel to the town of La Coruna where, with 47-year-old husband King Felipe, she toured the Museo de Belas Artes.

All business: She kept the dress businesslike by adding a tailored jacket and a pair of matching plum courts

Keeping busy: The meeting was Letizia's first of the week and follows a busy period of cultural pursuits

The previous week, again with King Felipe, she hosted the National Culture Awards and welcomed some of Spain's finest writers, directors and actors to the El Pardo Palace in Madrid.

Both Letizia, a former journalist, and Felipe are famous for championing Spanish culture, with Letizia even flying to Vienna last October to open an exhibition dedicated to Diego Velázquez.

Velázquez, who was born in 1599, is best known for his 1656 work, Las Meninas, which is usually housed in Madrid's Prado Museum.

The painting, which shows Infanta Margarita Teresa surrounded by her maids of honour and servants, was commissioned by Felipe IV - an ancestor of the current King Felipe. 

Interests: Along with Spanish culture, disability is a favoured cause of the Spanish queen
