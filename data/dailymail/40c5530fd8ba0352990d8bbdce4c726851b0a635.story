Pleasure in France is vice in England. The other week I made a documentary for French TV about Laurence Olivier and Vivien Leigh, for a series entitled Les Couples Mythiques du Cinéma.

We are also covering Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor. Had it been England, these programmes would have concerned adultery and immorality. This being a Continental audience, the subject was a great love affair, a grand passion.

Dirty Bertie: Edward VII went to France to indulge his 'pleasure-hungry nature'

Here, moral prejudices are aired, tongues wag and, as Stephen Clarke points out in this fine historical romp, in 19th-century dictionaries, ‘French’ was a synonym for ‘devil’ and ‘cad’. Sarah Bernhardt, for example, was a famous actress in France — in London she was branded ‘a woman of notorious, shameless character’.

Queen Victoria set the tone. She loathed the ‘luxuriousness, extravagance and frivolity’ of the French, so it is no wonder that Edward, Prince of Wales, was tempted by life on the other side of the Channel.

The regulations of his mother’s court, where the sole amusement was shooting at Balmoral and listening to bagpipes, bordered on lunacy. If you fancied a cigar, you had to surreptitiously lie in the fireplace and blow the smoke up the chimney.

And any idea of sex before (or outside of) marriage was an abomination. As Victoria put it, ‘the sacred mysteries of creation’ could only be countenanced if they remained ‘shrouded in holy awe’.

Edward fled to Paris for ‘boisterous fun’ at the earliest opportunity. Dressed in Highland costume — including a sporran, described in the French press as a ‘hairy bag’ — he attended trade exhibitions by day, examining telegraph machines, saxophones, electric clocks and modern gadgets that ‘sliced, crushed, harvested, heated, cooled or transported any industrial or agricultural products you could think of’.

By night he enjoyed assignations  with ladies of ‘natural poise and delicate beauty’ in the tree-lined alleys of the Bois de Boulogne or in hotel suites — legs-in-the-air parties in ‘sumptuous private rooms with plush red sofas and walls swathed in velvet’.

Where London life was puritanical and hypocritical, in Paris ‘there were flowers and plants everywhere, in vases along the walls and hanging from the ceilings like coloured chandeliers’.

Edward was to decorate his own homes, Marlborough House and Sandringham, in French style, with Gobelins tapestries and ‘plenty of gilding on the woodwork’.

Paris appealed ‘to Bertie’s pleasure-hungry nature’, but Victoria was predictably outraged

Paris appealed ‘to Bertie’s pleasure-hungry nature’, but Victoria was predictably outraged. In France, after all, men lolled on sofas with their hands in their pockets.

Her solution was to get the Prince married off — to Alexandra, daughter of the King of Denmark, who is described ungallantly. ‘Her nose was too long and her forehead too low.’  The poor woman also had ‘the smallest head ever seen’ and to cap it all was stone deaf.

In addition to these defects, she was obliged to turn a blind eye to her new husband’s myriad infidelities.

Fortunately, Alexandra ‘seemed to have what it took to survive the humiliation’ — and her stoicism was even needed during the wedding, which was gloomier than a funeral.

Exiled: Lillie Langtry - one of Edward's mistresses - was sent to a 'love nest' in Bournemouth

Victoria decreed that marriage was ‘a solemn holy act not to be classed with amusements’. In the official portraits, Edward wears a cloak, ‘the bulbously tasselled cord’ of which ‘hangs down over his crotch like an historic fertility symbol’.

Though no oil painting — he was ‘very bald and chubby-faced’— Edward carried on womanising until obesity and bronchitis took their toll.

We are told that the better to enjoy his ‘constant one-night stands and quickies,’ he invented an ingenious love-seat, a sort of saddle or bob-sleigh, with gynaecological stirrups attached. Less saucily — and ever fashion-conscious — he also introduced turn-ups on trousers to polite society, designed the first tuxedo and undid his lowest waistcoat button to accommodate a tummy that had swollen after many a 12-course dinner.

To this day, a way of spotting a gentleman is to see if he has left his lowest waistcoat button undone, in homage to Edward VII. Turn-ups remain commonplace.

My bet is that the love-seat has been inherited by his great-great-great-great-grandson Prince Harry. In France, Edward liked watching girls swirling on a carousel, with their ‘flying skirts and exposed calves’.

Not only that, but because prostitution was legal in the Republique, the tarts were ‘under medical surveillance,’ and regularly checked for venereal diseases.

Edward explored the bordellos of Montmartre and, having seen ‘the shadier world of street singers’, was inspired to chair a Royal Commission on the housing of the working class.

LILLIE LANGTRY: MANNERS, MASKS AND MORALS by Laura Beatty (Vintage, ebook £5.99)

A racy biography of Lillie Langtry, who rose form provincial origins to become Edward VII's mistress.

Includes her letters to Arthur Jones, her childhood friend and secret lover.

‘Parisian poverty made him acutely conscious of the similar conditions that existed back home.’

Environmental health aside, however, back home carefree sex was compromised by rubber condoms ‘as thick as kitchen gloves’. Edward seemed to do without precautions and didn’t quite get away with each and every dalliance in England.

When he gave his lover Harriet, Lady Mordaunt a pair of white carriage ponies as a token of his esteem, Sir Henry Mordaunt had the groom bring them to him and shot them dead on the front lawn.

Living for the good times: Bertie died in 1910, his health ravaged by high living

Another mistress, Susan Vane-Tempest, was packed off to Ramsgate. Lillie Langtry was exiled to ‘a love nest in Bournemouth’ — which wasn’t exactly Biarritz.

As he got older, Edward ventured forth to France for its health resorts rather than the brothels and salons. Biarritz was a favourite spot, as was the Cote d’Azur. ‘His less discreet mistresses complained that he stank of stale tobacco.’

He died in 1910, his health ravaged by high living. Alexandra sportingly allowed ‘big-busted’ Alice Keppel, one of his many beloveds (and Camilla Parker Bowles’s great-grandmother), to be present at the deathbed.

Stephen Clarke maintains that Kaiser Wilhelm, Edward’s nephew, was so incensed at having to enter Westminster Hall by a side-door for the lying-in-state that four years  later the World War broke out.
