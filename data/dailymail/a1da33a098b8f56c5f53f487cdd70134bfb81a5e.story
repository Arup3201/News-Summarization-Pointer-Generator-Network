Most ATMs serve the purpose of fattening our wallets but a new take on the facility looks set to fatten our waistlines instead.

Popular LA bakery Sprinkles, which launched a cupcake ATM Stateside, is bringing the device to the UK so that shoppers can get a sugary fix at all hours of the day.

The Beverly Hills company, which is said to be considering a number of different locations in London to install the machine, churned out up to 1,000 cupcakes a day when it opened the same facility in Los Angeles - and even reported that the machine crashed because of high demand.

Sugar fix: Popular LA bakery Sprinkles is launching a cupcake ATM in London so that fans can indulge 24 hours a day

Ready for launch: The pink ATM is already installed beside the Sprinkles outpost in Beverly Hills

The ATM would be continuously restocked throughout the day and night with a choice of 
eight cupcake flavours at any one time, priced at around £3.50 each.

Nicole Schwartz, head of marketing at Sprinkles, explained that the machines can hold up to 600 cupcakes, and any cake dispensed will have only been baked a couple of hours earlier.

She told The Atlantica t the time of the LA launch: 'The machine is attached to our bakery, 
which is essentially a 24-hour operation. By the time our closers leave 
at night, it’s 11pm and our bakers arrive in the wee hours of the 
morning (2 or 3am!).

Famous fans: Sprinkles is a favourite with the A-list including Heidi Klum (pictured at a store in 2008, left), Blake Lively (centre) and Khloe Kardashian (right)

'We’ll constantly be restocking the automat with 
freshly baked cupcakes so the cupcake you receive will only have been 
baked a couple hours earlier.

Whether the London machine will stock cakes for dogs too, like its LA counterpart is as yet unconfirmed.

Sprinkles in LA decided to stock the pet treats because health department regulations do not permit dogs in the bakery she explained, 'so you don’t have to tie up Fido while you head 
inside.'

Sprinkles is as famous in its American birthplace for its A-list fans as it is its buttercream-frosted treats.

Heidi Klum, Blake Lively and the 
Kardashian sisters have all been spotted in its stores (though quite how
 they eat cupcakes and maintain those bodies is anyone's guess).

And since The Great British Bakeoff hit screens, cupcakes are certainly in fashion on this side of the pond too.

Cakes, in flavours such as cinnamon 
sugar and chocolate coconut, sell for $3.50 each (£2.15) or $39 per dozen (£24) in the States, and prices are likely to be similar when the cakes launch in the UK.

So prepare those waistlines because it is only a matter of time before cupcake ATMs hit the UK.

Personal trainer and nutrition expert Jenny Dawes, who has worked with the likes of Ulrika Jonsson, right, gives her opinion….

'We should have treats occasionally. Making 'treats' so easy to access in 24 ATM machines may possibly end up 'eating' away at a persons willpower.

'In one breath we are hearing the message  to  cut down on fats, sugars and to eat a healthy diet.

'he visual message in launching a 'marketed' ATM machine that sells what I can only describe as devil food is not helping people maintain their healthy lifestyle.

'We all know that too much fat in our diet can lead to heart disease and some cancers.

'The danger with sugar is similar which, long term can contribute to diabetes, weight gain and also increased visits to the dentist with teeth cavities.

'It is difficult to put precise figures on the nutritional value of cup cakes without knowing the brand as they can vary quite dramatically.

'I would say the average cup cake has around 200 to 300 calories adding a further 100 -150 calories for frosting and fillings.

'A fat content of around 15 -20 grams with sugar levels around the same- not good news for our health or our weight.

'We all should have treats but I do believe the temptation with these 'marketed' 24 hour ATM machines will tempt and encourage an unhealthy approach to eating habits.
