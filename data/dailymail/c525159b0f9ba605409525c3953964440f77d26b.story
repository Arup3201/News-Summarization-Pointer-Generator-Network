Robin van Persie tweeted a picture of himself with Louis van Gaal's assistant manager Patrick Kluivert on Sunday night.

Holland captain van Persie, who scored a brilliant volley during Holland's friendly with Ecuador on Saturday, tweeted, 'Great bbq with my boys @PatrickKluivert landzaat & family'.

Kluivert, who was Holland's leading goalscorer before being overtaken by the Manchester United striker, is widely expected to join United this summer when Louis van Gaal replaces David Moyes after the World Cup.

It is understood that van Gaal will be announced as the new United boss on Monday, and looks likely to bring Holland assistant Kluivert in to work with him.

The picture of van Persie and Kluivert together will come as another blow to the 'class of 92', who seem set to be sidelined by the dutchman when he joins the club.

Interim manager Ryan Giggs will stay at the club alongside van Gaal and Kluivert, but the likes of Phil Neville, Nicky Butt and Paul Scholes are expected to leave when the current Holland manager joins.
