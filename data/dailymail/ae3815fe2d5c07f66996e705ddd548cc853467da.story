The number of people employed by the BBC has risen despite repeated promises to cut staffing levels.

Official figures have revealed that 22,039 people work at the corporation, an increase of 310 since last year.

It has also emerged that headhunters were paid more than £650,000 in 2013 to fill posts across the organisation.

Yesterday critics branded the staffing rise ‘astonishing’ and the use of headhunters ‘ludicrous’.

While the official employment figures – taken as a snapshot a month ago – include employees on permanent, fixed-term and flexible contracts, they do not include casual staff, so the true figure could be even higher.

In October 2011, then director-general Mark Thompson said 2,000 jobs would be cut by 2017 as part of a push to save £700million. However, the latest figures show the BBC is hiring people faster than it is cutting back.

A spokesman for the corporation claimed yesterday it is still on track to make savings of £850million by 2017 and that the rise in staff can be partly attributed to one-off projects.

He said: ‘Occasionally staff numbers will fluctuate depending on programme schedules and other special projects, such as the Commonwealth Games, covering the Scottish referendum, further development and personalisation of iPlayer.’

But the 2014 figure of 22,039 is higher than the 22,013 employed in 2012 when the BBC had the London Olympics and the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee to cover. There was a fall to 21,729 in 2013 before the recent rise. 

John O’Connell of the TaxPayers’ Alliance said: ‘At a time when all public sector organisations should be cutting back on staffing numbers, it’s astonishing the BBC’s has actually increased. ‘You’d have thought the headcount would peak during a big event like the Olympics so the continued growth is disappointing news for families feeling the pinch, hoping for cuts to the licence fee.’

The BBC has also been criticised over the amount it has spent on headhunters. 

Figures obtained under the Freedom of Information Act show that in the calendar year 2013 the BBC spent £657,522 on ‘recruitment consultants, executive search, and headhunting firms for the hiring of BBC staff at all grades, including senior staff and members of the executive board’.

In the financial year ending March 2013 it spent £700,813. It was during this period that £150,000 was paid to recruitment consultants to find a replacement for Mr Thompson.

But then the BBC made an internal promotion, giving George Entwistle the £450,000-a-year job. He lasted just two months before quitting after a series of scandals including the Sir Jimmy Savile revelations and Newsnight’s wrongful implication of Lord McAlpine in a child abuse case.

Tory MP Philip Davies, a member of the Commons culture committee, said it was ‘completely ludicrous’ for BBC to spend so much on headhunters.

He added: ‘Most businesses seem to do perfectly well drawing up their own shortlists and don’t have to resort to hiring expensive headhunters.

‘It’s another example of the BBC having too much money, which is why we should have a reduced licence fee.’

A spokesman for the BBC said its main recruitment channel is its website.

He added: ‘We do however sometimes use external recruitment consultants to help ensure we obtain applications from a wide range of high-quality candidates, often for very specialised roles.’
