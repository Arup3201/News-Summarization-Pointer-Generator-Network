Captivated jurors in a Cincinnati murder trial watched video Tuesday that prosecutors say shows a dying, paralyzed shooting victim who couldn't speak identifying a photo of his killer by blinking his eyes.

Over the unsuccessful and repeated objections of defense attorneys, prosecutors showed the jury a 17-minute video of shooting victim David Chandler, 35, in which he answers detectives' questions by blinking twice to say ‘no’ and three times for ‘yes.’

Ricardo Woods, 35, is charged with Chandler's October 2010 murder and has pleaded not guilty.

Eye contact: Shooting victim David Chandler blinked his eyes hard three times, opening them wide in between each blink, after he was shown a picture of Ricardo Woods and asked if he was his attacker

Prosecutors say that in the video, Chandler clearly identifies Woods as his attacker, while Woods' attorneys argue that his blinks were inconsistent and unreliable.

The video is considered the key piece of evidence in the trial. Jurors will have to determine whether Chandler appears alert and knew what he was doing when he said ‘yes’ to Woods' photo.

In the video, police have to repeat some questions when Chandler fails to respond or when the number of times he blinks is unclear.

But when police show Chandler a picture of Woods and ask him if he was the man who shot him, Chandler looks at it for a couple seconds before blinking his eyes hard three times, opening them wide in between each blink.

When police ask him whether he's sure that's the person who shot him, he again blinks three times.

All the jurors watched the video closely, some silently moving their lips as they appeared to count the blinks and some taking notes.

One woman appeared upset by the video, which shows a clearly struggling Chandler lying in a hospital bed, his face and body connected to tubes and machines, his vital signs on display in the background.

Woods, dressed in a brown suit, sat quietly watching the video.

Cincinnati police Detective Howard Grant testified earlier in the day that he had ‘no concern at all’ that Chandler understood what he was being asked and pointed out that he'd answered many questions by blinking before being asked to identify the shooter.

Also Tuesday, a jailhouse informant 
testified that Woods told him that he killed Chandler because he caught 
him buying drugs from someone else while still owing Woods money.

The informant, Jermaine Beard, is facing four counts of armed robbery that could carry a prison term of up to 56 years.

Defense
attorneys questioned Beard's motives, pointing out that he testified in
two other murder cases and getting him to acknowledge that he was 
trying to get a light sentence for himself by helping prosecutors.

In
opening statements last week, defense attorney Wendy Calaway told 
jurors that Woods did not shoot Chandler, calling him ‘an innocent man 
who found himself in a perfect storm of misinformation and 
misidentification.’

She said that Chandler had stolen drugs from dealers, was considered a police ‘snitch’ and had many enemies.

Paralyzed and hooked up to a 
ventilator, David Chandler was two weeks from death when police arrived 
at his hospital room to question him about the person who shot him. They
wanted to know if he could identify a suspect, and they had a photo to 
show him.

Chandler was unable to communicate 
except with his eyes as he lay in bed attached to myriad tubes and with a
brace around his neck. His eyes opened barely more than a slit at 
times; he was instructed to blink three times for yes and twice for no. 
One detective quizzed him, and another videotaped his responses.

Chandler
didn't respond with blinks to every question in the 17-minute video, 
and there were solo blinks. But triple blinks came in response to 
repeated questions asking if he knew the shooter and whether the person 
in the photo was the culprit.

Legal
experts say such cases - while not unheard of - are unusual, and dying 
identifications relying on gestures rather than words are often not used
in trials because of concern over reliability or differing 
interpretations. But some have been used in murder cases around the 
country that have ended in convictions.

Police
asked Chandler to blink three times for yes and twice for no to a 
series of questions in the interview, said Assistant Hamilton County 
Prosecutor David Prem.

Chandler also blinked yes to indicate
that he knew the gunman and that his name began with the letter O, Prem
said. O was a street name that Woods sometimes used, the prosecutor 
said.

Familiar: Woods reportedly knew the victim through drug deals

The motive for the shooting, the prosecutor said, was that Chandler owed Woods money for drugs.

Chandler was a drug user who had 
bought drugs many times from Woods but had gone to an area near Woods' 
home the night of the shooting with two friends to buy drugs from 
someone else.

Chandler was shot about 20 yards from Woods' home and in an area known for drug deals, he said.

Prem said that while neither of the 
men in the car with Chandler could clearly identify the man who shot 
him, one heard a voice yelling Chandler's name.

Defense attorney Wendy Calaway 
insisted that Woods did not shoot Chandler. She also focused on the blinking 
identification, saying that while doctors were able to establish a 'rudimentary' communication system with Chandler, 'his blinks were 
inconsistent and sporadic'.

Law: Judge Beth Myers of Hamilton County Common Pleas Court ruled at an earlier hearing that jurors could see the videotape, saying she found the blinks reliable

He only blinked in response to doctors' commands about 50 percent of the time, she said.

Both sides are expected to call 
medical experts to testify about the ability of someone in Woods' 
condition to understand and respond to questions.

Other witnesses expected to be called
include a priest who was a friend to Chandler and gave him money before
the shooting, Prem said.

The judge has said that the trial could take up to three weeks.
