In another, she adopts a sultry pose in an evening dress, with her blonde curls tumbling over her shoulder.

These family snapshots of Colonel Gaddafi’s daughter Aisha were among several unearthed by rebels at the dictator’s former headquarters in Tripoli.

Yesterday it was reported that she had given birth within hours of escaping to Algeria with other members of her family.

The 35-year-old lawyer, nicknamed the
 ‘Claudia Schiffer of North Africa’ because of her bleached blonde hair 
and European education, had a baby girl after evading rebel forces in 
her home country.

The revelation came as Algeria defended its decision to let members of the tyrant’s family into the country.

As well as his pregnant daughter, Gaddafi’s wife Safia and sons Hannibal and Muhammad are also in Algeria.

Algeria said it had no option but to 
give refuge to the family and said it was a ‘holy rule of hospitality’ 
to take in those in need of help.

But Algeria sought to head off any 
more criticism by closing its southern border with Libya and saying it 
would not allow Colonel Gaddafi and his other sons into their country.

If they did manage to get into 
Algeria, they would be handed to the International Criminal Court, the 
government in Algiers said. Gaddafi is wanted on several charges by the 
ICC for crimes against humanity.

Earlier, Libyan rebels had acted with fury at news the family had fled to Algeria.

The government-in-waiting, the 
National Transitional Council, described the harbouring of the Gaddafis 
as ‘an aggressive act against the Libyan people’s wish’.

The Gaddafis arrived with a posse of 
bodyguards in six armoured Mercedes on Monday. All of their respective 
partners and other children were also with them.

The convoy is said to have crossed 
the border at the south-western Libyan town of Ghadames, and then begun 
heading towards Algiers, the Algerian capital.

An Algerian government official said:
 ‘Aisha gave birth very early this morning without medical equipment. 
She had a little girl. Mother and daughter are both doing very well.’

Aisha is Gaddafi’s only biological 
daughter, and spoke out in support of her father throughout the civil 
war. ‘He is my remedy against pain and my fortress against grief,’ she 
said.

Aisha also spoke up for Saddam 
Hussein following the Iraq War. ‘When you have an occupying army coming 
from abroad, raping your women and killing your own people, it is only 
legitimate that you fight them,’ she said at the time.

In 2006 she married her cousin Ahmed 
al-Gaddafi al-Qahsi, an army colonel with whom she had three children. 
According to the Gaddafis, Qahsi was killed during the bombing of 
Gaddafi’s compound on July 26, which means that Aisha will be a single 
mother.

Algeria has not yet recognised the NTC, and none of its extradition treaties applies to Libya.

Algerian foreign minister Amar Belan 
said in a statement that his country had adhered to a policy of ‘strict 
neutrality’ throughout the Libya crisis and respects ‘the decision of 
every person under its sovereignty’.

He added that Algeria has no intention to ‘interfere in any manner whatsoever in the internal affairs’ of Libya.
