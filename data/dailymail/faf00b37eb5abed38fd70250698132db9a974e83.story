Federal Agents have seized thousands of artifacts including a piece of Adolf Hitler’s bunker from the suburban Indianapolis home of a 91-year-old World War II veteran.

About 100 FBI agents have taken truckloads of items from Australia, China, Haiti, New Guinea, Peru and even Native Americans that Don Miller insists he obtained legally.

Officials haven’t said whether charges will be filed against Miller since he obtained most of them legally or before laws aimed at curbing their import were even written, FBI Special Agent Robert Jones told WRTV.

‘The cultural value of these artifacts is immeasurable,’ said Jones.

Aerial footage from WISH showed several tents and trailers at man’s home, squad cars lining his street and even a command center that was set up by authorities.

The items were taken from Miller’s home, a second residence on the property and multiple other buildings, according to the Indianapolis Star.

Miller, who worked on the atomic bomb, according to the Rushville Republican, never attempted to hide his collection – which even includes a human skeleton.

‘It’s unreal, the full skeleton is what blew my mind,’ neighbor And Essex told WISH. ‘I had even asked him, ‘Can I bring my Grandpa? Can I?’ He was like ‘Oh, sure! Just call me. Yeah, we’d love to show him through here.’

‘Hitler’s bunker I think was my favorite. Yeah, the piece of the bunker,’ she added.

Miller told the station he willingly invited the agents into his home despite continuing to argue all the belongings are his.

‘He is being cooperative and so far everything is going well,’ FBI spokesperson Paul Bresson told WISH.

The former teacher has travelled to over 200 countries in the past eight decades, according to the station. It is not clear how he obtained the items, but he claims it was all through bartering and legal purchase.

Items are in violation of treaties and other agreements or laws will be returned to their rightful owners, Bresson told ABC 6.

‘We have outside experts on the scene to identify, preserve and collect the items in his collections.’

The rest will be returned to Miller upon verification nothing illegal contributed to their acquisition.

‘I have never seen a collection like this in my life except in some of the largest museums,’ one of the experts brought in by the feds to catalog the items told the Star.

Another person told the Star ‘it may be 30 years, or never,’ before the items are cataloged.

Don Miller told agents the items are all his and were acquired in the course of traveling to more than 200 countries over the course of eight decades

Authorities are not sure if he will be charged with any crimes since many of the artifacts weer obtained before laws were written to prevent their taking

Items in violation of laws and treaties will be returned to their rightful owners - but that might take 30 years or more
