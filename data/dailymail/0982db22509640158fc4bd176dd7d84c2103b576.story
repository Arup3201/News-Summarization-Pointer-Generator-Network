Communities Secretary Eric Pickles (pictured) indirectly but 'unlawfully discriminated' against gipsies, the High Court has ruled

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles 'unlawfully discriminated' against gipsies by using his ministerial powers to personally decide whether they should be allowed to settle on green belt land, the High Court has ruled.

In a ruling likely to affect many other travellers, a judge found both human rights and equality laws were breached by Mr Pickles and his department for 'calling in' cases which would normally be considered by his planning inspectors.

Mr Justice Gilbart, sitting in London, said Mr Pickles was operating a legally flawed policy of 'recovering' for his own consideration appeals by travellers who claim there are exceptional circumstances for allowing them Green Belt sites.

The judge said an inspectors' decision was normally received within eight weeks of the end of an inquiry - but it could take six months or more for a decision letter for a called-in case.

No attempt had been made by Mr Pickles and his ministers to follow steps required by the 2010 Equality Act to avoid indirect discrimination, and 'substantial delays' had occurred in dealing with the appeals in violation of Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights, said the judge.

His test-case ruling was a victory for two Romany gipsies- Charmaine Moore, a single mother with three children who is under threat of eviction from a site at North Cudham in the London borough of Bromley, and Sarah Coates, a disabled woman also with three children fighting to live temporarily on Green Belt land at Sutton-at-Hone near Dartford, Kent.

 Both women wanted to live with their children in caravans on their own green belt land but were refused planning permission by their local councils.

Their subsequent appeals were automatically referred to Mr Pickles under the 2013 'calling in' policy, which meant any appeals over planning decisions relating to traveller sites in the green belt were automatically referred to the Secretary of State. 

The judge found  Mr Pickles had breached the Equality Act 2010 by indirectly discriminating against gipsies and travellers through this policy.

The judge said Mr Pickles' department had 'coined and developed' a practice in 2013-2014 of calling in all, and then a majority, of Green Belt traveller cases - most involving Romany gypsies or Irish travellers - 'which discriminated unlawfully against a racial group'.

He was also found to have breached Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights by delaying the women's right to justice. 

He ruled that the Moore and Coates cases were two such 'unlawful recoveries' and quashed them.

Planning Minister Brandon Lewis said: 'This Government makes no apologies for seeking to safeguard Green Belt protection and trying to bring a sense of fair play to the planning system.

'The Government's planning policy is clear that both temporary and permanent traveller sites are inappropriate development in the Green Belt. Today's judgment does not question that principle.'

But the Equality and Human Rights Commission, which supported the gipsies challenge after becoming concerned that the 'call in' policy may be unfair, welcomed the judge's finding of indirect discrimination.

An EHRC spokesman said: 'We have a duty to protect everyone from discrimination and ensure that the law is applied fairly, consistently and equally for all.

'We understand the need to be sensitive about Green Belt development but this should not be used to single out individuals for unlawful discrimination.

'Planning decisions should be taken on the merits of an application, not the characteristics of the applicant.' 

Gipsy and traveller leaders have condemned Mr Pickles' policy which, they argue, has enabled him to predominantly overturn recommendations to allow site planning appeals.

They say local councils have consistently failed to earmark land for potential sites in local plans, and many gipsy travellers have bought land, including in the Green Belt, to develop sites for themselves.

The Community Law Partnership, which brought the case on behalf of the two women, told The Independent the implications of the judgement were 'enormous' and that around 100 gipsy and traveller planning appeals which were overseen personally by Mr Pickles since July 2013 could now be challenged in the courts.
