Rickie Lambert's dream week will continue on Wednesday when he leads England’s attack in their penultimate World Cup warm-up in Miami as a Liverpool player.

Lambert’s Anfield move will be confirmed on Sunday after he passed a two-part medical, which began at Spire Hospital in Mossley Hill at 9am on Saturday, then completed at the club’s Melwood training ground.

A £4million fee with Southampton and terms for a two-year contract had already been agreed.

Big chance: Rickie Lambert will start for England in their World Cup warm-up game against Ecuador

Waiting: Lambert was an unused substitute in England's 3-0 win against Peru on Friday

It was another whirlwind day for Lambert, 32, who travelled up to Merseyside after England’s 3-0 win over Peru on Friday night, then flew back to see his family on the south coast after the medical.

Released by Liverpool at 15, he forged his career in the lower leagues.

Lambert said: ‘The medical went well, but I can’t really say anything else. It has been a crazy couple of years.’

England step up their preparations for Brazil against Ecuador and boss Roy Hodgson is eager to give game time to those not heavily involved against Peru, which means Lambert will win his fifth cap.

Hodgson handed Lambert his England debut last August, when the striker scored a header in a 3-2 win over Scotland, and hopes the move to Anfield further invigorates a career that has taken off at Southampton.

Dream move: By that time Lambert will have completed a move to his boyhood club Liverpool

Dedication: Lambert is part of the 23-man England squad travelling to the World Cup in Brazil

Hodgson said: ‘I’m sure that when he plays against Ecuador you’ll see a fella’ running around with all the joy that his heart can muster. He’s very happy to be here with England and that the move has gone through to Liverpool. I congratulate him and I congratulate Liverpool on signing a good player.’

Liverpool already had five players in Hodgson’s 23-man squad but the deal for Lambert, and the pursuit of Adam Lallana, could take that figure to seven.

Lallana would be allowed to undergo a medical in Miami this week if the Saints relent and accept Liverpool’s £25m offer.

Lallana has his heart set on following Lambert to Anfield and wanted his switch to be completed before England’s World Cup campaign starts, but Southampton are digging their heels in.

They rejected Liverpool’s £20m offer, made at the end of the season, then received a take-it-or-leave-it £25m bid on Friday night.

Southampton will owe 25 per cent of whatever fee they receive to Lallana’s first club Bournemouth.

Bayern Munich’s Xherdan Shaqiri has been lined up by Liverpool if the move for Lallana falters.

Hodgson has sympathy for the Saints but added: ‘Good players are always going to gravitate to big clubs, that’s where the money is and that’s where the Champions League football is.’

Third in line: Lambert will be expected to provide competition for Daniel Sturridge and Luis Suarez at Liverpool

Highly-rated: Liverpool are also interested in Lambert's Southampton and Liverpool team-mate Adam Lallana
