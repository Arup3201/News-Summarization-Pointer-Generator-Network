Sir Alex Ferguson has revealed that Sergio Garcia kept thanking him for selling Cristiano Ronaldo to Real Madrid during the Ryder Cup.

The former Manchester United manager gave a 30-minute talk to Europe’s team at Gleneagles before answering questions from Garcia, Rory McIIroy and Co.

Ferguson is keeping what he said a secret but insists Real Madrid fan Garcia was delighted with United’s decisions to sell Ronaldo to the Spanish giants for £80million in 2009.

Speaking to the Big Issue, Ferguson said: ‘When Paul McGinley first approached me about going up to Gleneagles, we agreed that what was said in the dressing room stayed in the dressing room. That’s the way I’ve always operated. 

'But it’s OK for me to tell you that I talked mainly about how to cope with being a favourite, just like we usually were at United. I also spoke with the caddies and with the players’ wives about different things.

‘But the banter was great. I mean, Rory McIlroy and Graeme McDowell are season-ticket holders at Old Trafford but Ian Poulter supports Arsenal, Thomas Bjorn supports Liverpool, Lee Westwood supports Nottingham Forest and Sergio Garcia is a huge Real Madrid fan. He kept thanking me for transferring Cristiano Ronaldo!

‘But really my main contribution was to encourage everyone to be calm over the seven days. When United were involved in big games, I always tried to help the team think it was just another day until we got right down to business. Outside of football, the Ryder Cup at Gleneagles was the greatest sporting challenge in which I’ve been involved.’

Cristiano Ronaldo has starred at Real Madrid since he signed for the Spanish giants five years ago 

Since retiring from football at the end of the 2012-2013 campaign, Ferguson has also been lecturing at Harvard University and revealed his concerns over whether Paul Scholes would make it as a footballer due to his small stature.

He said: ‘We talked a bit about how you pick the stars of the future and nurture them, something I’ve done all my life in football. I was very aware that the first time I clapped eyes on Paul Scholes, I thought, ‘too small’. 

'But that’s when nurturing talent comes in. And you’re rewarded hugely. It’s a fantastic challenge but I’m speaking mostly about leadership and I’m comfortable doing that.’

Ferguson is still involved in football as chairman of the Elite Club Coaches Forum and as a member of the Champions League and European Championship technical study group – meaning he remains instrumental in the future direction of the game.

He added: ‘Right now we’re looking at the possibility of introducing sin-bins like they have in rugby; a ten-minute suspension during the match. But we want to be careful that somehow it isn’t exploited if it’s introduced. 

'We’re also looking at wiping out bookings when teams reach the latter stages of a cup competition. We lost Darren Fletcher from the 2009 Champions League Final against Barcelona and also missed Keane and Scholes for picking up cards in the 1999 Champions League Final against Bayern Munich. 

'Now, they’d all played in all the previous rounds so it wasn’t fair that they missed out. We’ll see on that one. We’re also looking at allowing eleven substitutes on the bench for big finals in Europe. That way you can recognise the contribution the squad’s made and allow a wider range of substitutions.'
