Tesco is to divide its customers into rich and poor by using Clubcard data to personalise its website to display items geared towards your wealth.

Upmarket shoppers who click onto the retailer’s new home page will be tempted by smoked salmon and an array of sumptuous fine food.

Hard-up shoppers will be presented with tins of baked beans and Tesco’s Value promotions.

Reversing its fortunes: Tesco is fighting to improve its sales

For years Britain’s biggest grocer has been able to chart the spending habits of regular shoppers using its loyalty card and now it is using some of that data to tailor its websites with items aimed at individual shoppers.

The supermarket giant is fighting a desperate battle to reverse its fortunes in the UK after a dire year in which it has lost out to rivals and posted its first profit warning for 20 years.

With its website it wants to recreate some of the personal service that shoppers used to enjoy on the High Street.

Tesco boss Phil Clarke said in a speech published yesterday: ‘We are turning Clubcard digital. We’re now making changes to our UK website to highlight promotions that are relevant to the customer who is browsing the site.

Speech: Phil Clarke unveiled the proposal yesterday, with the scheme part of the Clubcard going digital

‘Using Clubcard data, we would show, for example, offers of our everyday Value range to price sensitive customers, and offers of our Finest range to more upmarket customers.’

He said if you think back a generation to the 1980s many retailers would know their customers individually.

‘Some customers you would know by name,’ he said. ‘Others you’d know well enough to give a friendly smile and ask ‘how are you today?’

‘If you knew and understood each of your customers inside out, you could give them what they wanted.

‘By doing that, you could earn the most important thing of all: customers’ loyalty. Loyal customers are the most precious asset any company can have.’

Tesco has already carried out a trial on its website personalising certain items based on the wealth of shoppers. It carried out a test on mattresses.

Clarke said: ‘When a customer visited our website, we would use Clubcard data to tell us if the customer was more swayed by price or quality. We’d then display the type of mattress that best reflected that shopper’s characteristic. Sales grew by 10pc.’

The move to engineer its website socially is likely to be controversial for Tesco. It risks shoppers taking offence at being presented with baskets of low cost items when some might actually enjoy browsing through more expensive products.

Other grocers have also found upmarket shoppers like to mix and match the items in their trolleys - filling them with premium products such as meat, where it matters, and buying budget salt and potatoes where it matters less.

Most physical supermarkets already offer a two-tier shopping experience, filling the shelves of stores in more upmarket areas with caviar and fine wines while less prosperous regions get value ranges of pasta and canned food.

Clarke says personal service is the way forward and he wants customers to feel part of a ‘special group’ with staff feeling able to surprise the big spenders.

‘It means treating our best customers as we would our friends by giving our staff more freedom to surprise loyal customers with special offers,’ he said.

‘Trusted retailers will be those that do more than simply deliver value, choice, convenience.

‘They will be there in the global online, marketplace, just like those ancient traders in the markets you would have found here thousands of years ago, getting to know their customers, hearing what they have to say, delivering a personal service.’

Tesco is also introducing a raft of new initiatives aimed at boosting sales. It is putting free wi-fi in more of its stores which will give additional service to Clubcard holders using smartphones.

The phones will be able to tell the user where goods on their shopping list can be found in the store.

And, as they walk around the store, the smartphone will use its Clubcard data to make other suggestions about what they might want to buy, and point out offers.

The retailer has also transformed a series of interactive posters at a tube station in Korea into a virtual store.

The posters show images of shelves containing different items that simulate various aisles and passengers waiting for their trains can do their weekly shop by scanning the barcode on items they want from the posters and building an online shopping list which can be ordered to deliver at their home.
