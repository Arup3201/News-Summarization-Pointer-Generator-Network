Former Labour Foreign Secretary and party donor David Owen has been exposed as having invested in a tax avoidance scheme – in a major embarrassment for Ed Miliband.

Lord Owen has been ordered to repay around £50,000 after an investigation by the tax authorities. He is a supporter of Mr Miliband and last year he gave £7,500 to the Labour party.

HMRC investigators will this month insist the 76-year-old settles within 90 days or face legal action. 

Lord Owen has been ordered to repay £50,000 following an investigation by HMRC in an embarrassing development for the Labour party. Leader Ed Miliband has in the past taunted the Tories over having 'dodgy donors'

His tax avoidance arrangement appears to have undermined Mr Miliband’s ‘dodgy donors’ taunt hurled at the Conservatives in the wake of the HSBC tax scandal.

Lord Owen served in the Callaghan government as Foreign Secretary between 1977 and 1979. He left Labour in 1981 – one of the Gang of Four who formed the SDP. 

He now sits in the Lords as an independent Social Democrat.

In 2010, he ploughed almost £70,000 into a business partnership called the Cumberland House BPRA Property Fund.

Investment advisers Downing claimed it offered ‘attractive taxation incentives’ under the Business Premises Renovation Allowance.

One expert estimated that Lord Owen’s original sum would have ‘grossed up’ to around £130,000 – leaving him with an avoidance bill of ‘between £50k and £60k’.

Lord Owen said: ‘My accountants are instructed to be completely open with HMRC and to pay what is due.’ 

Last night, the Labour party did not respond to our requests for a comment.
