US goalkeepers Tim Howard and Brad Friedel have ended their feud over claims made in the former's book.

Veteran Tottenham shot-stopper Friedel was accused in his fellow American's book The Keeper of looking to prevent Howard's move to Manchester United going through in 2003, a claim he labelled 'ludicrous'.

Howard, now with Everton, accepts his fellow goalkeeper's version of events and future print runs of the book will be amended to reflect this.

The disagreement stemmed from a letter of recommendation Howard asked Friedel, then playing for Blackburn, to sign on his behalf as he attempted to secure a work permit for his move from the New York/New Jersey Metrostars.

Friedel felt the letter contained numerous inaccuracies that he was not prepared to put his name to - but disputed the assertion that he then wrote to the Professional Footballers' Association opposing Howard's move.

Howard posted a statement on his Twitter feed on Tuesday evening in an attempt to bury the hatchet.

Friedel says he didn't sign a letter of recommendation for Howard as it contained a number of inaccuracies 

It read: 'In telling the story of my move to Manchester United from MLS, I describe at length a number of obstacles that potentially stood in the way of a massive career-changing opportunity. One of many such obstacles that I discuss in this context is opposition to my work permit by the PFA and, as I understood at the time, Brad Friedel.

'Brad takes issue with my characterisation of his position and (the) events. At the time, I was surprised that Brad would not automatically sign my letter of recommendation, and I took this as an opposition to my application. Brad later explained that he had not in fact opposed my efforts to seek a work permit, either by writing to the PFA or otherwise.

'I have decided to take Brad at his word. Accordingly, I have directed my publisher to amend future copies of my book by striking reference to Brad's opposition.'

Friedel, now with Tottenham, then reposted the statement, adding: 'Glad it's over, happy to move on.'

In the original book, Howard wrote: 'The legal team at Manchester United ... told me that Brad hadn't merely refused to sign a statement on my behalf, he had actively tried to block my transfer. He'd written to the appeals committee suggesting that I shouldn't be given a work permit at all.'

Friedel responded to ESPN FC on December 4: 'I never sabotaged, and I never stood in the way of Tim Howard getting a work permit. This is ludicrous.

'(The letter) was sent to me, and the only thing that was true on it was my name. The letter was full of exaggerations that the people on the PFA and appeals committee would have seen through.

'It said that I had been in direct competition with Tim Howard for the starting job on the US national team for the last two years, when anyone who follows (US) soccer knew it was between Kasey (Keller) and I.

'Yes, I refused to sign that. We got the letter and said "We have to change this, because this isn't true." We made our changes and sent it back. They didn't like what I was going to sign, so they didn't use it. And that was the end of the matter.'
