Syrian President Bashar Assad saw in the New Year with a rare visit to a combat zone where he shared a meal with his troops - as sinister figures showed the death toll from the civil war  hit 76,000 in 2014 alone, including thousands of children.

The extraordinary total made 2014 the deadliest so far in the nearly four-year war,according to Syrian Observatory for Human Rights which recorded the deaths of 76,021 people. Of the total, 17,790 were civilians, including 3,501 children.

State TV footage showed Assad having dinner with soldiers and pro-government gunmen in the east Damascus district of Jobar last night.

Heavy fighting in the strategic neighbourhood killed at least 25 Syrian soldiers and pro-regime militia on Wednesday before the visit, the observatory said.

Assad was shown sharing a meal of baked beans, boiled potatoes and tomatoes with soldiers and pro-government gunmen known as National Defense Forces. 

'On New Year's Eve families gather but you decided to be here to protect your country,' Assad told the troops as sporadic shooting could be heard. 

'I like to be with you on this occasion.'

Assad described rebels who use underground tunnels as 'rats', adding 'we fight them above the ground'.

The footage, aired today, showed Assad shaking hands and kissing troops, walking into fortifications and climbing onto a tank.

Rare visit: The last time Assad (left in both photos) visited the frontline was in August 2013

Assad's visit came as rebels fired nearly two dozen mortar shells on Damascus, residents said. It was not clear if there were casualties. 

Assad has rarely made public appearances since the country's crisis began in 2011.

The last time he visited the frontline was in August 2013, when he went to the former opposition bastion of Daraya outside of Damascus.

The war began in March 2011 with peaceful protests against President Bashar Assad's government, but quickly escalated into a full-blown civil war after a brutal regime crackdown.

In addition to civilians, more than 15,000 rebel fighters were killed, as were nearly 17,000 militants from jihadist groups, including the Islamic State and Al-Nusra Front, Al-Qaeda's Syrian affiliate.

At least 22,627 government forces - both soldiers and members of pro-government militias - were killed, the Britain-based group said.

Last year's figure compared with 73,447 in 2013, another 49,294 in 2012 and 7,841 in 2011.

More than 200,000 people have been killed since the conflict began in March 2011 with anti-regime protests that spiralled into a war after a government crackdown.
