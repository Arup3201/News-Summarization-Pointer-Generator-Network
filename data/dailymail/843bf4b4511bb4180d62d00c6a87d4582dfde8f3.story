A ‘good Samaritan’ Home Guard veteran died after being burgled five times in nine weeks.

Following the fourth break-in, Leslie Ashton, 93, developed fatal pneumonia after a callous thug threatened him with a hammer and terrorised him for an hour.

During his final stay in hospital, the widower was burgled again by the same man, Mohammed Nawaz, whom a judge said had caused his ‘eventual deterioration and death’.

Mr Ashton’s terraced home in Sparkhill, Birmingham, where he had lived for most of his life, was targeted three other times by different offenders.

The victim’s devastated niece, Vivian Allen, said: ‘He would still be alive today had it not been for the burglaries.

‘He had been living for 67 years at the property and he had never had any problems.

‘He was determined to stay there because it was his home and he had his pets.’

Judge William Davis QC, sitting at Birmingham Crown Court, yesterday gave Nawaz, 42, an indeterminate sentence for public protection and ordered that he remain behind bars for a minimum of six years.

The judge told Nawaz: ‘These were wicked offences. It is not often I deal with wicked men but you are one of them. ‘You threatened him [Mr Ashton] with a hammer, manhandled him around his own home and stole his property as he watched.

‘Remarkably your victim was able to get outside and raise the alarm and for a few weeks carried on living at his home address.

‘I am quite satisfied what you did must have led to his eventual deterioration and death. Nawaz, of Albion Road, Sparkhill, had previously admitted two charges of robbery, two of burglary and two of theft.

Mrs Allen said: ‘I think it was a fair sentence. We feel we have got a little bit of justice for him.

‘He was a gentleman, a really good samaritan, he helped people in the neighbourhood even when he got old.

‘He would go shopping and clean windows.  He had a warm heart and helped those in need.

‘When he was young he cycled and loved clocks. He even built a grandfather clock.

‘He loved hymns and his favourite programme was Songs of Praise - he never missed it.

'We went out to celebrate his 93rd birthday in September. We all enjoyed the day.’

Paul Dhami, prosecuting, said Nawaz first broke into Mr Ashton's at 9.30pm on November 30 last year.

He was wearing gloves and a hooded top and demanded money, taking GBP10 from the victim's pocket.

He then ransacked Mr Ashton's home.

At one point the victim blocked a door after the defendant went into his kitchen, but Nawaz forced it open and threatened Mr Ashton with a hammer.

Mr Dhami said Nawaz manhandled the pensioner upstairs and took his mobile phone. He then ripped the landline to his phone from the wall to stop him calling for help.

His ordeal lasted for about an hour. Mr Dhami said Mr Ashton was the victim of other burglaries. He died of pneumonia after being admitted to hospital.

While he was in hospital Nawaz broke in again and stole a laptop which had been fitted with a tracking device by police. This led officers to him.

In between the two attacks on Mr Ashton's home, Nawaz also robbed an 84-year-old woman outside her home, also in Sparkhill, taking her gold watch.

He also broke into the home of a 66- year-old woman living in sheltered accommodation, but left empty- handed after her carer stopped him.

Charnjit Jutla, defending, said Nawaz, who had previous convictions for robbery and burglary had become desperate for money because of his drug addiction.
