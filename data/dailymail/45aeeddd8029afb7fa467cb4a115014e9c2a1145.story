The Duchess of Cornwall has hosted a tea party for seriously ill children as part of a week long annual visit to Wales with Prince Charles.

Camilla chatted with the youngsters - most of whom were battling life threatening illnesses -Â  as she met with them and their families at the home she shares with Prince Charles while in Wales.

The bash, held at a converted barn 
on the couple's Llwynywermod estate, was organised by Dreams and Wishes - a voluntary 
organisation that makes the dreams and wishes of terminally ill children
come true.

The party was held by Prince Charles and Camilla for 'Dreams and Wishes' charity at their home in Llwynywermod, Wales

Camilla chatted with the youngsters- most of whom were battling life threatening illnesses - and their families at the converted barn. Cardiff footballer Nicky Maynard was also invited

Jack Gow, of Cardigan, has a 
rare form of cancer called Parameningeal Rhabdomyosarcoma - which causes
tumours behind the eyes.

Thanks to Dreams and Wishes, the 
10-year-old had a special treehouse built in his back garden to try and 
lift his spirits during a stay in hospital.

Mother Sylvie said the generous gift touched her family - and gave Manchester United fan Jack a big boost.

'It meant a great deal especially because he had just a relapse at that point,' she said.

'The treehouse is on 7ft stilts and he loves the view out across the sea.

'And we will treasure days like today
- getting invited into a tea party with the Duchess - as we want to 
create as many happy memories for Jack as we can.'

Dreams and Wishes founder Tony Curtis said days like today where what his charity lived for.

Cardiff-based Mr Curtis, who has 
helped more than 120 families over the past two years, said: 'We're 
quite a small organisation, and really rely on the goodwill of people to
make youngsters' dreams come true.

'But being small can be to our 
advantage as we can get things done very quickly - there's no network of
managers I have to go through to get something done.'

As well as being treated to a 
performance of Disney songs from Carmarthen Youth Opera, those attending
the bash were also given a special gift - a Welsh Guard teddy bear - 
each from the Duchess.

And one youngster who definitely made an impression on the Duchess was seven-year-old Neave Ritchie, of Pontypridd.

The budding photographer, who has 
continually battled cancer from the age of three, got some of the best 
snaps of the tea party with her digital SLR.

She had the Duchess in fits of laughter, after the youngster walked up to her and asked for a close-up photo.

Mother Emma, 33, said her daughter has always had a keen interest in photography.

'We went to a trip to the House of 
Commons recently and Neave ended up telling the Speaker of the House to 
move further to one side so she could get a better shot,' she added.

'I'll often pick up my camera and 
notice there's lots of photos taken on there at knee height - which 
means Neave has got the camera.

And Ms Ritchie - who also brought 
along eldest daughter Leiah, 13 - said the photos from today will be 
taking pride of place back at home.

She added: 'Neave's an amazing little
girl who's been through so much - so I can't thank everyone enough for 
giving us a special day.'

And before the Duchess made her 
farewell, she was presented with a plaque bearing the name Llwynywermod 
as well as a young oak tree.

She said: 'Thank you. Every time I look at this tree in years to come I will think the great time we had today.'

It comes as Prince Charles began his week-long annual visit to Wales - with locals near his holiday home in Carmarthenshire expressing their pride at his return

The royals visit continues today with a series of engagements in north Wales.

And on Wednesday they will visit the 
BBC Wales drama studios at Roath Lock in Cardiff Bay to mark the 50th 
anniversary of Doctor Who, during which they will meet members of the 
cast including departing doctor Matt Smith.

Prince Charles began his week-long annual visit to Wales - with locals near his holiday home in Carmarthenshire expressing their pride at his return.

Since 2008, the Prince of Wales has called the small rural village of Myddfai home for seven days.

But rather than shut the doors and draw the curtains - on what is officially classed as his holiday - the Prince and The Duchess of Cornwall have gone on regular visits to communities and projects across the region.

Llandovery town councillor Nigel Burgess said locals now viewed the Prince as of one of their own.

He said: 'We're just a small town in the heart of rural Wales, so the fact that our future king chose this neck of the woods to be his home means a great deal to people.

'It's not only put us and local good causes on the map, but it's given us a tremendous sense of pride.'It means all the more because this is supposed to be the Prince's holiday - but he's never put his feet up and locked himself in his holiday home.

'He's always got involved.'
