He often talks about becoming a professional footballer for Manchester United, but Usain Bolt showed that his sporting talent also extends to cricket after taking part in an exhibition match in India.

The world's fastest man headed to Bangalore on his first visit to the country after his sponsor, Puma, organised a seven-a-side, four over match at the Chinnaswamy Stadium.

Bolt and his team faced off against India international Yuvraj Singh, also a Puma ambassador, and his own side as local fans flocked to watch the action after free tickets were handed out.

The Jamaican star showed that he's more than just a fast runner by displaying both his batting and bowling skills as his side came out on top in the short match.

After losing at his own game, Singh was then given a chance for revenge in a 100 metre race inside the stadium.

The 32-year-old didn't disappoint, somehow managing to leave Bolt in second place as he tasted victory for the first time on Tuesday.

After coming out on top in the cricket, Bolt tweeted an image of himself in the changing room with the message: 'India was great fun..of course bolt team won the cricket match #boltinIndia'
