The owner of a San Diego restaurant says he’s abolished tipping waiters for the last six years and service has only gotten better.

Concerned about income disparity between servers and kitchen staff, Jay Porter and his employees opted to tack on an extra 18 percent to each customer’s bill and distribute the money evenly among everyone who worked at his farm-to-table restaurant, The Linkery.

Instead of creating an unhappy, unmotivated waitstaff, something miraculous happened: service actually started to improve.

Gratuity included: Not a single tip was left at The Linkery in San Diego for six years

Porter wrote about the experience of running The Linkery, which specialized in farm-to-table cuisine with the tag line ‘Our friends grow food for you and we cook it,’ in a recent Slate article.

‘Within a couple of months,’ writes Porter, ‘our server team was making more money than it had under the tipped system. The quality of our service also improved.’

Over time, the servers evidently earned more overall with more consistent pay. And better service, logic would say, meant more customers with more of those built-in 18 percent gratuities.

But it wasn’t just the service that benefited from the change, which the restaurant made a few years after The Linkery opened.

The food also improved.

‘Our food improved,’ writes Porter. ‘Probably because our cooks were being paid more and didn't feel taken for granted. In turn, business improved.’

Porter insists it’s not just about the money.

‘In my observation, however, that wasn't mainly because the servers were making more money (although that helped, too). Instead, our service improved principally because eliminating tips makes it easier to provide good service.’

Porter says in the years his restaurant, which recently closed, enforced the rule his business and service got progressively better.

Less cutthroat? By giving servers to the same incentives as workers in other industries, Porter says his they strove toward professionalism and raises

‘Servers want to keep their jobs,’ he reasons. ‘Servers want to get a raise; servers want to be successful and see themselves as professionals and take pride in their work.’

Most workers, Porter writes, must only negotiate salary occasionally, but servers must take on the often belittling task many times per day.

Also unlike most workers, servers must negotiate with the customers who benefit from their work instead of with the employers who understand the difficulty of what they do.

Porter and his employees simply made the stakes the same for everyone else.

‘These two principles probably apply at your work, too, if you work somewhere other than a restaurant and with your clothes on,’ he writes.

Though his employees and most of his customers were more than satisfied with the arrangement, Porter says he came up against critics.

In fact, one detractor was literally a critic, for the local alt weekly of San Diego’s restaurant scene.

Even the city’s attorney threatened to shut The Linkery down over the issue, which he called deceptive.

In spite of them and the fact that his great experiment has come to an end, Porter maintains that tipless restaurants are the wave of the future.

‘It's a system that's successful in other industries, and in restaurants in other countries. It can work here, too—and it can work better, in almost every way, than the system we have now.’
