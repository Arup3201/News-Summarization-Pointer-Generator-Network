Stoke

Stoke boss Mark Hughes hopes a neck problem will not rule Peter Crouch out of the clash at Goodison Park.

Potters striker Crouch was forced off by the issue in the second half of Monday's 2-0 home loss to Chelsea.

It remains to be seen whether midfielder Stephen Ireland, who missed that game due to a knee injury, will be fit enough to be involved against the Toffees.

Provisional squad: Begovic, Butland, Shawcross, Wilson, Huth, Pieters, Cameron, Bardsley, Muniesa, Nzonzi, Adam, Ireland, Whelan, Walters, Arnautovic, Bojan, Assaidi, Diouf, Crouch.
