The garden entitled 'Stop The Spread' is the work of designer Jo Thompson

The taxpayer is to spend almost £100,000 designing and building a garden featuring an 'avenue of dead trees' at the Chelsea Flower Show, MailOnline can reveal.

Ministers claim the extraordinary use of government money will help educate the public on the dangers of pests and diseases which threaten Britain’s flora and fauna.

But critics condemned the 'frippery' of the ‘cock-eyed’ plan at a time when 60 experts in forest research have been sacked as part of government cost-cutting.

The embattled Department for 
Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, which signed off the idea, is 
already under fire for cuts to flood defences and animal disease 
controls, and its role in the system failure which saw horsemeat sold in
 beefburgers.

Now it has emerged ministers have agreed to a garden at the RHS Chelsea Flower Show in May, entitled ‘Stop the Spread’.

The
 £95,000 cost for the design and build is largely coming from the 
coffers of Defra, which suffered some of the deepest cuts of the 
coalition austerity programme.

Also chipping in are the Forestry Commission, the Welsh and Scottish governments and the Timber and Pallet Federation.

It is the work of award-winning designer Jo Thompson who has been hired by the Food and Environment Research Agency to highlight the issue of plant disease 'in a way never seen before'.

It comes after the government was heavily criticised for its handing of the outbreak of ash dieback disease which threatened Britain's 80million ash trees.

to come up with the concept for the display

Publicity material for the bizarre stunt explains how the garden will be split into two zones: beautiful and ugly. 

A
 sunken garden featuring 'quintessential native trees and lush 
shade-loving planting' will be 'starkly contrasted with sinister and 
shocking elements'.

Ministers have rejected a tax on plastic bags, fearing a backlash from hard-pressed shoppers.

England is set to be the only country 
in the UK which allows free bags, with a charge already in place in 
wales and both Northern Ireland and Scotland preapring to impose a levy.

But environment minister Richard Benyon has again ruled out the idea.

'We are currently assessing various measures to reduce the distribution of single use carrier bags,' he said.

'However, we recognise the pressures on household budgets at this time; levying even a small charge may not be the best option.'

These include 'an avenue of dead trees', an 'ominous' pool with an island holding a single sapling, and concrete-panelled walls.

Dr David Slawson, head of plant 
health public engagement at Fera, said: It’s really important that we 
all work together to help protect the British countryside for future 
generations to enjoy. This garden is a “call to arms” to the great 
British public to help stop the spread by changing our behaviour, even 
in small ways.'

The message of the garden is: 
'British trees and plants are under threat from pests, diseases and 
invasive species – help us stop the spread!'

Organisers
 hope it will persuade the public to wash their boots after walking in 
the countryside, buy plants locally and dispose of garden waste 
properly.

But former 
forestry minister Barry Gardiner, who unearthed the costs in 
parliamentary questions, condemned the extraordinary use of public 
money.

‘I love Chelsea Flow Show, I love all flower shows. I wish them to flourish,’ the Labour MP said.

‘But
 the idea that we are sacking 60 people in forest research and spending 
£95,000 on a show garden for two weeks at Chelsea trying to communicate 
to people the danger of forest disease strikes me as the most cock-eyed,
 inverted, upside-down, arse-over-tit, cart-before-horse proposal I have
 ever heard.'

More than 150,000 people attend the Chelsea Flower Show every year but the decision to use public money to design and build a garden at the event has been condemned

In the 2010 spending review Defra's budget by 30 per cent, well above the Whitehall average of 19 per cent.

Mr Gardiner went on: ‘Where are 
their priorities? It is absolutely typical. It is all about public 
perception. It is all about putting a brave face on things.

Environment minister Richard Benyon said the garden would 'deliver strong messages to the public'

‘How
 any civil servant had the guile to go to a minister and say “wouldn’t 
it be a really good idea that would show the public we are doing 
something about pathogens to have a garden at Chelsea?” I just do not 
know. And then the minister says “what a good idea”.’

Environment minister Richard Benyon 
claimed the garden will ‘deliver strong messages to the public on the 
scope for behaviour change to make a significant impact on the 
prevention and identification of pests and pathogens that could affect 
our trees, including the threat from non-native species’.

The
 show garden at the two-week event in central London is ‘just one 
element of a campaign of public and stakeholder communication regarding 
tree health and plant biosecurity’, he added.

‘All of these activities are aimed at addressing threats which have huge potential to change how our landscape looks, severely damage our biodiversity and wildlife, and can have significant impacts on the British economy.’

But Matthew Sinclair, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance campaign group, said:  'Taxpayers will be stupefied that ministers are shelling out nearly £100,000 on a show garden for a fortnight at the Chelsea Flower Show.

'Defra has got its priorities completely wrong if that is deemed to be the best use of the money as there are far cheaper ways of communicating messages about diseases in trees and plants. The Department needs to get its spending under control and cut out waste on this kind of frippery.'

In a statement Mr Benyon said: Tree health is an issue of great importance and it is vital that we use international events such as this to help address the problems we are facing. 

'Every leading organisation with which we need to engage will be at this event and the garden will highlight the importance of bio security and the impact tree diseases could have if we do not work together to tackle them.'
