Still a hero: Gunned down Army vet Francisco Garcia was initially said to have returned from Afghanistan just before his murder but Army officials now say that's not true

The U.S. Army revealed Wednesday that a vet murdered outside what Los Angeles police said was his 'return from Afghanistan party' was never deployed in the Central Asian country

IN fact, they say he never fought abroad at all.

Francisco Garcia's tragic November 9 murder was infuriating enough to military families and patriotic Americans alike, but became immeasurably more horrifying after witnesses and police on the scene in Sylmar reported the soldier had just returned from active duty in war-torn Afghanistan.

Only, he hadn't. And LAPD authorities have yet to explain the conflicting stories. 

The U.S. Army said Wednesday that Garcia enlisted in June 2012 and discharged this past July.

He was stationed at Ft. Drum in Watertown, New York, according to CBS News.

However, accounts from the start from friends of Garcia seemed unclear whether he'd served abroad or not.

Nonetheless, police did quickly identify a suspect in the case and made an arrest for 21-year-old Garcia's murder on Tuesday.

A witness claims that 18-year-old Vincent Estrada was one of the occupants of two cars that pulled up to Garcia after he'd left a party at his girlfriend's house Sunday.

Witness Brian Enriquez, 21, told the LA Times that, after leaping from one of the cars and smashing a beer bottle on the ground, Estrada grabbed a handgun and yelled: 'Are you ready for this?'

He then opened fire, police say. Garcia was dead on scene.

Estrada was arrested Tuesday in the Sylmar area and booked on suspicion of murder, Los Angeles police spokeswoman Officer Nuria Vanegas said.

Before Wednesday's revelation about Garcia's service, Los Angeles police Lt. Paul Vernon told reporters that 'the ironies are obvious. To survive as a soldier in an overseas conflict, only to be killed in your neighborhood upon your return.'

Vernon said: 'Apparently a simmering dispute had boiled over during the night, and this suspect came looking for Francisco.'

Authorities talked to several witnesses and collected evidence, including several bullet casings.

Enriquez told the LA Times: 'He was a very loving, caring person. He would always have a smile on his face. An all-around amazing individual.'

High hopes: Friends say Garcia had hoped to soon join the California Highway Patrol and had already been accepted into the academy

Hundreds mourned Garcia's death at the spot where he died in Sylmar, including his 25-year-old friend Fernando Mora. 

'He came back alive,' Mora told the Los Angeles Times. 'So to die like this, it's not right.'

However, some friends on scene disputed to NBCLA that Garcia had served abroad. And LAPD officials backpedaled on their original report within hours of a release that said the party was a 'homecoming.'

'There was a gathering, but it wasn't specifically for a homecoming,' Detective Juan Santa said.

 Garcia soon hoped to join the California High Patrol, and according to friends had already been accepted to the academy.

Estrada was booked on suspicion of murder.
