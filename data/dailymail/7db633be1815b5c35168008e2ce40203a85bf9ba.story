Compensation: Oliver Keynes with his passport and the stamps Royal Mail offered

A holidaymaker whose passport was lost in the post by Royal Mail has been offered six stamps in compensation - despite the ordeal costing him £500.

Oliver Keynes was forced to cut his three-week trip to India to nine days due to the loss of his ID, which was sent to Trailfinders as part of a visa application.

Mr Keynes, from Bristol, said he had used Royal Mail's special delivery service to send his passport in the post, but when the travel company opened the envelope, nothing was inside.

The delay 
forced Mr Keynes to reduce the length of his trip - and he also had to 
pay out for a replacement passport, and spend another £500 on a new 
flight to India.

However, when he approached Royal Mail for compensation, the organisation offered him six stamps by way of an apology.

Mr Keynes told the BBC: ‘I was asking for a refund of the costs that I've had to spend as a result of having my passport stolen.

‘I'd also 
like, if not an apology, then a little bit of feeling like I've been 
treated with respect for something that was nothing to do with me.’

The letter Mr Keynes received apologised for the missing item of mail.

However, it said the firm had taken the 'following action', which included enclosing a book of stamps 'as compensation for the loss'.

Royal Mail has now offered to reimburse Mr Keynes for the passport costs.

But the firm told the BBC that it could not cover 'unlimited liability for costs incurred' unless extra 'consequential loss cover is also purchased at time of posting'.

A spokesman added: ‘We process millions of items each day without incident and take seriously any customer reports of loss or undelivered items.

‘We will in this instance reimburse Mr Keynes for the cost of his passport and postage costs.

‘Royal Mail would like to apologise unreservedly to Mr Keynes for this incident and for the obvious inconvenience caused.’
