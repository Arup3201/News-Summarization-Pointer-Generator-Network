England flag-bearer Nick Matthew kissed his right knee after beating fierce rival and compatriot James Willstrop to retain his Commonwealth singles squash title.

Matthew, 34, only had knee surgery five weeks ago, yet came through a five-game thriller to become the first man since sprinter Darren Campbell in 2002 to carry the flag at the opening ceremony and go on to win Commonwealth gold.

The world No 1, who fell out with Willstrop after sledging him in the 2009 British Open final, was taken into a deciding game by the 30-year-old, but came through 11-5.

Matthew said: ‘James is so good that I can’t play good squash against him. He brings out the worst in me. All I can do is just whack it to the back because he’s so good. If it was a boxing match I think they would have thrown the towel in, but I managed to dig in.

‘I’m a Yorkshireman, an only child and a Leo. Put that together and you’ve got one hell of a stubborn so-and-so.’

England’s Laura Massaro, 30, suffered double pain as she was beaten 3-0 in the final of the women’s singles by world No 1 Nicol David and bashed in the face by her opponent’s racket. To make matters worse, Massaro then lost the point in question to the Malaysian after attempting to appeal to the video review system.

‘I was disappointed with that,’ said Massaro, who had a game point to go 1-0 up but then lost the next two games 11-2 and 11-5 in just 20 minutes. ‘But ultimately my squash wasn’t good enough today . . . a silver is probably about what I deserved.’
