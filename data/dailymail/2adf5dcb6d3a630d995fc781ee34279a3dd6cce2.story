Gift: The 40-year-old schizophrenic, who believes he is a prophet, fought his mother in a legal battle to let him donate a tenth of his inheritance to the Latter Day Saints

A delusional man who believed he was a prophet has been given free reign to donate nearly £7,000 to the Mormon Church by the Court of Protection - against the wishes of his family.

The mother of the schizophrenic had been fighting to block her 'vulnerable' 40-year-old son from making a 'tithe', an Old Testament concept ordering Christians to donate 10 per cent of their earnings to the Church.

But today, District Judge Anselm Eldergill ruled there was 'no reason' to stop the man doing as he pleased.

The unidentified donor told the court: 'I simply wish to abide by the Old Testament principle of giving a 10 per cent 
tithe. This is standard practice in my church; not me being exploited.

'Generally,
 I wish to enjoy the right of obeying my church's teachings on financial
 matters. With regards to my financial affairs, my decision to give a 
tithe to my church is both rational and Biblical.'

The man had said he had given a tithe of around £1,600 to the Latter 
Day Saints about a decade ago when he was 'well' adding: 'I had been 
tithing since early 2004 when I discovered the verse in which members of
 my church are commanded to start tithing in this way.'

According to Judge 
Eldergill, the man's mother told the court that she was 
'surprised and distressed' by the case.

'We have no idea how much pressure is put upon [him] by his church to donate or tithe his money,' she said.

'I am personally strongly opposed to [him] being permitted to make a donation of this size.'

Psychiatrists disagreed about the man's 'capacity' to make the gift, Judge Eldergill revealed.

One said the man had the capacity to 'make a gift on the tithes principle'.

Distress: His mother told the secret court her son was too vulnerable to decide for himself. He intends to make a 'tithe', an Old Testament idea where Christians donate 10 per cent of their wealth to the Church

Another said the man was making the request in the context of his 
'psychotic illness' and 'delusional ideas regarding religion' and the 
request should be 'disallowed'.

Judge Eldergill concluded that the man had an 'impairment' of the mind and a 'delusional belief' that he was a prophet.

Old Testament law required Christians to 'tithe', where they offer 10 per cent of everything they earn to the Church.

Advocating multiple tithes, it often ended up being around 25 per cent.

It is believed by many to have been invented as a tax to subsidise priests' income.

It was never advocated in the New Testament.

Today, Mormons are still required to tithe to achieve salvation.

Catholics in some countries are also required to tithe, although churches now recommend a donation of around three per cent.

But
 he said: 'Although, on the evidence, I have accepted that his belief 
that he is a prophet is a delusional belief, that does not mean that all
 of his religious beliefs are delusional or compromised by the presence 
of mental illness.

'The fact that a person has a grandiose belief 
with a religious content does not demonstrate that the whole of their 
religion is delusionally-based and caused by mental illness.'

He 
added: 'In what way, therefore, does his belief that it is necessary or 
appropriate to give a tithe stem directly from his delusion that he is a
 prophet or constitute an extension of it?'

Judge Eldergill said the 
fact that relatively few people tithe now was 'neither here nor there' 
and it was not enough that others thought the proposed tithe 'unwise', a
 'misinterpretation of a religious text' or 'misguided'.

But the judge said it was relevant that the man's belief was a 'matter of faith'.

'It cannot be demonstrated that [his] desire to give this money to the 
Mormon Church is part of his delusional belief system,' Judge Eldergill 
concluded.

Although psychiatrists disagreed about the man's 'capacity', Judge Eldergill ruled in the man's favour

'The issue is finely balanced. In my view, the presumption of capacity has not been displaced.'

The
 judge added: 'His belief that he is a prophet does not impinge on his 
capacity to argue and present his case with regard to the tithe and the 
other litigation issues. He has prepared and presented his case very 
ably and I cannot identify any point of substance in support of his 
position that he has not articulated.'

Judge Eldergill said he had noted the man's mother's 'strong opposition' and her 'sincere concern' for his welfare.

But the judge said her objections were of 'limited assistance' in determining the man's 'capacity and best interests'.

And he said there was no evidence that 'pressure had been applied' by the church.
