Primary schools are squeezing pupils into temporary classrooms and building rooftop playgrounds in a desperate bid to cope with surging numbers, it was revealed today.

The Local Government Association has warned that councils are going to 'extraordinary lengths' to ensure there are enough places for children across the country.

This includes introducing extra reception classes, as well as using former police stations, church halls and other disused buildings for lessons.

The primary school place crisis has been fuelled by a baby boom that began more than a decade ago, along with rising immigration and more parents opting out of the private sector.

Experts have previously claimed that Labour and the Coalition have ignored repeated warnings to act over impending shortages.

Births in England have been steadily rising since 2002, causing a surge in the number of primary aged pupils from 2010. A blackhole of at least £1billion in school place funding is compounding the problem, according to the LGA.

This has led to local authorities borrowing millions of pounds from developers, raiding school maintenance cash and other building programmes in order to plug the gap.

Last year, councils created an additional 90,000 primary places, but analysis by the LGA reveals a further 130,000 would still be needed by 2017/18 – and 80,716 new secondary places by 2019/2020.

Under-pressure schools are already turning IT and music suites into classrooms or using mobile teaching areas. Some are considering bussing pupils to different areas, building on split sites and even on the green belt.

The only way was up for Birkdale Primary School when it expanded to meet rising pupil numbers.

Architects put the playground on the extended roof of the 378-pupil school in Southport, Merseyide, due to a lack of space.

The facility was unveiled in February as part of a £1.5million scheme to create new classrooms, a kitchen and entrance to the school, and was funded through Sefton Council's New Starts programme.

Headteacher Nick Sheeran said: 'We're all thrilled with the development at the school.

'It was a joy to see the faces of our children when they first saw their new play space.

'It was an incredible feat of skill and engineering and all involved should feel very proud of their achievement.'

Inspectors said: 'Pupils can access an exciting range of exercise equipment, and the new roof-top 'playdeck' provides an ingenious solution to the school's previous lack of outdoor space.'

Brighton and Hove Council is converting a former police station into a junior school, while a former infant school is being leased back to officials by a further education college. Bournemouth is considering introducing village schools in former church halls or day centres.

LGA research published today shows that more than three-quarters of councils did not receive enough government money to create the extra school places needed in their area between 2011/12 and 2016/17.

A survey of chief finance officers in 150 English councils found that 38 per cent had borrowed money as a result.

Almost a quarter (22 per cent) took money from other building programmes and half raided funds from programmes such as school building maintenance, while 67 per cent used cash put aside by developers.

Councillor David Simmonds, chairman of the LGA's Children and Young People's Board, said: 'Mums and dads expect their child to be able to get a place at a good local school and this research shows councils are delivering, but at a cost.'

* Parents fear their children are being rammed into 'cattle classes' putting their safety at risk amid the growth of supersize primaries, according to a survey of 2,000 parents by the Netmums website.

One in four believe that areas around school gates have become 'dangerously overcrowded' due to an influx of primary pupils.

Over half – 53 per cent – want their children taught in smaller classes, while almost one in five think that schools are packing too many youngsters into classrooms.
