Owners of lawnmowers, mobility scooters and golf buggies may have to take out motor insurance under a new EU directive.

It follows a ruling from the European Court of Justice that an accident involving a tractor trailer on private land should have been covered by compulsory insurance.

Cover must now be obtained for ‘any motor vehicle intended for travel on land and propelled by mechanical power’.

UK ministers are worried the directive could even apply to ride-on lawnmowers because the definition of motor vehicles is so unclear. 

There is also concern that insurance costs could rise for all drivers. 

The ruling comes following a European legal case involving a Slovenian, Damijan Vnuk. He was hurt after falling from a ladder when it was hit by a reversing tractor trailer.

Because it involved a vehicle being used as an ‘agricultural machine’ and took place on private property, motor insurers refused to cover the claim.

In September, The European Court of Justice ruled the accident should have been covered by compulsory vehicle insurance.

As a result, motor insurance is now required to cover vehicles used in all situations — not just on roads.

The definition has also now been extended to ‘any motor vehicle intended for travel on land and propelled by mechanical power’.

Roads minister Robert Goodwill said that it would probably lead to a rise in insurance costs for all British motorists.

They are charged an average £30 levy to cover accidents involving untraced or uninsured drivers – which he said would have to go up as the scope of motor insurance was broadened.

Meanwhile, a Conservative party spokesman told The Times: ‘This is clearly a bonkers ruling. 

'Only with David Cameron as PM will British people get a referendum on our membership of the EU.’
