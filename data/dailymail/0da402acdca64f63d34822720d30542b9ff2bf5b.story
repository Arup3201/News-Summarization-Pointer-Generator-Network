Alan Hutton is battling to be fit for the friendly against England after Aston Villa ruled him out for another two weeks 'at least'.

The Scotland defender sprained his ankle during training in the run-up to Monday's 2-0 defeat at QPR.

Villa manager Paul Lambert confirmed: 'Alan will be touch and go for the Scotland games. It depends how quickly he heals. It's a shame because he has been excellent for us this season.'

Aston Villa manager Paul Lambert, on the bench at QPR on Monday, has praised Hutton's form this season 

Hutton's injury could not have come at a worse time with Philippe Senderos also out of action with a thigh strain.

Villa have lost five League matches on the bounce, without scoring a goal, and entertain Tottenham on Sunday.

'The Scotland game will be touch and go, I know we've got a fortnight roughly to go but it depends how quick a healer he is,' said Lambert, who also could be without Philippe Senderos (thigh) on Sunday.

'Alan sprained his ankle in training, on the Friday before the QPR game. There was no major tackle.

'Alan and Philippe were part of a back four who barely conceded a goal in the first four games.'

Hutton has returned to the Villa side after being left out by Lambert during most of his reign but he has impressed this season and signed a new three-year contract in September.

Lambert added: 'Even last year he was playing well for Scotland and I never had any trepidation in him playing. He has been excellent and Senderos too.'
