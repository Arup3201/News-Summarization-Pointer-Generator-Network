Thousands of Eastern Europeans are making little or no income tax contributions despite working full-time, a report claims today.

The UK’s generous tax credits system means thousands of migrants without partners or children, who earn the minimum wage, pay just £1-a-week net income tax, including National Insurance.

If they have a non-working partner and children, it costs the taxpayer money to support them, according to Migration Watch.

A singe earner couple with two children receives nearly £90 a week more in benefits than they pay in tax.

With two children, the cost rises to £295. For three children it is £400, four children £500 and five children £600 per week.

The think-tank’s analysis said a couple where both partners work on minimum wage would pay in a total £28 net. But if they have two children they could receive a net benefit of £380 a week.

The group added that the calculations do not include indirect taxes such as VAT nor do they include health, education and social services.

There are also major costs in later life, for pensions and health, to which the low-paid will make no significant contribution. These could amount to £120,000 for a single pensioner and £160,000 for a couple.

Sir Andrew Green said the taxpayer was 'subsidising' the wages of many low paid migrants from the ex-Eastern Bloc, who have had access to the UK jobs market since 2004. Pictured are Polish economic migrants leaving for Britain that year

According to official figures, around 25 per cent of Poles and other Eastern Europeans are earning the minimum wage or less.

Only 4.5 per cent pay the higher 40p rate of tax, compared to 15 per cent of the UK population as a whole.

The tax credit system, largely engineered by Gordon Brown, tops up the wages of the lower paid.

It benefits British workers in the exact same way as people from overseas.

But Migration Watch said that the figures blew a hole in claims that mass migration is good for the economy because of the taxes paid by foreign workers.

Chairman Sir Andrew Green said the taxpayer was ‘subsidising’ the wages of many low paid migrants from the ex-Eastern Bloc, who have had unrestricted access to the UK’s jobs market since 2004.

He added: ‘No wonder then that employers are in favour of them and that so many people find the UK such an attractive destination.

‘We constantly hear that immigrants work hard and pay their taxes.

‘There is no doubt that many of these people do work hard but it is a fact that those on the minimum wage pay virtually no direct taxes and, if in a couple, they can receive significant sums in tax credits and other benefits.

‘Recent claims that EU migrants make a “very sizeable” contribution to the Exchequer have simply not taken into account that the low incomes of so many mean that they receive much more in means-tested benefits than they pay in tax.’

Last month, Migration watch predicted immigration from the EU will add an annual 130,000 to the UK’s population - equivalent of a new city the size of Manchester to the UK’s population every four years.

The total include 50,000 Romanians and Bulgarians and 40,000 people from Poland and the seven other Eastern European nations which joined the EU in 2004. 

A single worker on the minimum wage in the UK would be able to earn four and a half times that which they could earn in Romania

The remainder are expected to come from the so-called ‘old’ EU - including large numbers from Greece, Spain and Italy fleeing the eurozone disaster.

The campaign group said one of the major pull-factors to the UK was the generous system of in-work benefits, such as tax credits.

Sir Andrew said ministers should consider denying migrants access to in-work benefits and tax credits for the first five years they are here.

Under the current regime, a single worker on the minimum wage in the UK would be able to earn four and a half times that which they could earn in Romania. For a family, this rises to nine times.

Any attempt to treat EU migrants differently to British citizens, who receive the same level of tax credits and other benefits, would spark a huge row with Brussels.

The European Commission is already dragging Westminster to court over the so-called ‘right to reside’ test.

Earlier this month, statisticians admitted a “substantial” number of Eastern European migrants arriving in Britain in the last decade were not counted.

Net migration in the UK between 2001 and 2011 was 346,000 higher than previously thought as a result of 'inadequate sampling' of arrivals into the country, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.

An earlier version of this article reported claims from Migration Watch that 150,000 Eastern European migrants with no partners or children who are earning the minimum wage paid just £1 a week in net tax, including National Insurance. In fact, other statistics in the report show that, of this number, childless couples will in fact pay more. All of the workers contribute to the Exchequer through VAT and other indirect taxes. We have now amended the article accordingly.
