Charlie Pallett, 93, last boarded a plane during the Second World War when he was evacuated from Germany on a stretcher. 

His wife of 71 years, Madge, 91, has never stepped foot in an aircraft and her sole overseas jaunt was a day trip by ferry to Le Touqet in France.

That's all about to change for the sprightly nonagenarian duo as they head off for a week in Benidorm to spend their  first overseas holiday together.

Time to pack: Madge, 91, and Charlie Pallett, 93,  prepare for their first ever overseas holiday to Benidorm

Charlie and Madge, from Shepway, Kent, have always taken their trips away to the British seaside but will soon be sunning themselves at Spain's Hotel Sol Pelicanos, a filming location for the hit TV series Benidorm.

Royal Army Service Corps veteran Charlie joked that the plane's legroom may not be up to the standard he's accustomed to after his medical evacuation on a stretcher.

'I flew in a Dakota from Germany to France when I broke my ankle during the war but that was a hospital plane,' he said. 

'It was lovely, I got to lie down on a stretcher but I'm not sure if I'll get the same legroom this time.

'I never wanted to go back to Europe after the war, but I have put that all behind me now.'

Madge, who made camouflage nets during World War Two, is putting her own anxieties behind her as the pair set off for the resort at which hit TV series Benidorm is filmed.

'Madge has never set foot on a plane and she gets very anxious on public transport, you can't even get her on a bus. I fell off my chair when she said yes [to the trip],' Charlie said.

She said: 'I'm very nervous but I'm also very excited about it. It's going into the unknown for me.'

Charlie will however have to buy a new pair of swimming trunks after finding a pair of old favourites while packing: 'I think [they] are from the 1960s. They were very fashionable back then, but I don't think I'll take them with me.

'I was asked what the pocket inside them was for and I said that's where I'm going to keep my false teeth.'   

The grandparents of five and great-grandparents of seven will make the trip with daughters Doreen England, 67, Yvonne Elliott, 65, and their granddaughter Leigh Plumbly, 46.

Beside the seaside: Mr and Mrs Pallett, who have been married 71 years, have always holidayed in Britain

'Our daughters had been talking about going away and we were enthusing over the brochures,' Charlie said.

Yvonne, a retired cook, said: 'We didn't really have many family holidays when I was little because we couldn't afford them.

'I remember going to Dymchurch, when my dad was a driver and we went in the back of his three-tonne lorry.

'When we got there everything stunk of diesel. I never thought in my life I would be going abroad with my mum and dad.'

Other favourite holiday haunts for the couple have included Great Yarmouth, Norfolk and Dorset.

Far from their age being any sort of disadvantage, the Palletts got a pleasant surprise when they went to update their long-overdue passports.

'You get them free when you are older than 90, but that's not the reason we've waited until now,' Charlie said. 'The next time we have to get them renewed is when we are 101 and 103.'

And if Madge thinks this breakaway adventure is a one-off, she's got another thing coming with Charlie already planning his next flight... on the outside of a plane.  

'I have wanted to do a wing-walk for a long time, and hopefully with this under my belt I will finally do one next year,' he said.
