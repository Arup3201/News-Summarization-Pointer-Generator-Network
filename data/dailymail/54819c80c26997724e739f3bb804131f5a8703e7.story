Turns out the tombstone of former New York City mayor Ed Koch isn't doin' so good.

Though Koch meticulously planned every detail of his burial before dying in February, his gravestone was marked with the wrong birth year, as first reported by NBC New York.

The 5-foot tall tombstone lists Koch's birth date as December 12, 1942 instead of 1924--shaving a full 18 years off the departed and beloved New Yorker's life.

Typo: The birth date on former NYC Mayor Ed Koch's tombstone, seen here without the date, was listed as 'December 12, 1942' instead of 1924. The dates were engraved a few weeks ago

Oops: His birth year is wrong, shaving 18 years off his age when he died earlier the year

The flub is particularly embarrassing considering his 'new' birth date would have made Koch a child in World War II, and the same headstone says he served in the armed forces during that time.

Koch, who served three terms as mayor from 1978 to 1989, died of congestive heart failure on Feb. 1 at age 88. Three days later, Koch was buried in Trinity Church cemetery in the Washington Heights neighborhood of Manhattan.

'I don't want to leave Manhattan, even when I'm gone,' Koch said when he revealed he bought the plot in 2008, according to NBC.

Koch's former chief of staff Diane Coffey said at his funeral he began preparing for his death before even finishing his time as mayor in the 1980s.

Koch pre-ordered his tombstone, which is 6-feet wide, but the birth date wasn't engraved until a few weeks ago.

A manager with Trinity church called Koch's friends and family when he noticed the mistake, according to the New York Post.

One of the former mayor's confidants, George Arzt, told the Post the mistake 'took [his] breath away'.

'Do you believe it?' Arzt imitated Koch to the Post. 'Correct the record!'

'We're correcting the record, Ed,' Arzt added.

Tommy Flynn of Flynn Funeral and Cremation Memorial Services, which hired the stone cutter, said he felt 'terrible' because the 'inadvertent error'.

'I have to make it right. I will correct it,' Flynn told NBC.

Coffery said she was 'appalled' by the mistake, but that Koch might have thought it was amusing.

'As Ed Koch used to say, "It's always important to correct the record,"' she said.

On the tombstone, Koch included the words of journalist Daniel Pearl, who was killed by Islamic terrorists: 'My father is Jewish; my mother is Jewish; I am Jewish.'

The tombstone also has an epithet that Koch wrote himself:

'He was fiercely proud of his Jewish faith. He fiercely defended the City of New York, and he fiercely loved its people. Above all, he loved his country, the United States of America, in whose armed forces he served in World War II.'Â
