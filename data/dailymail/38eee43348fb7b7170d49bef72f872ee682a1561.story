Outrageous: James Tracy claims that the government was behind the Boston Marathon bomber that left 3 dead and more than 180 injured

The Florida college professor who sparked controversy after saying that the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School may not have taken place is now infuriating even more people by saying that the Boston Marathon bombings were an inside job.

James Tracy, a media professor who writes extensively about conspiracy theories, said that last week's bombing appears as if it was planned by the government.

'The event closely resembles a mass-casualty drill, which for training purposes are designed to be as lifelike as possible,' he wrote in a blog post.

Other topics of rumination on his site include a number of the classic conspiracy theories: the September 11 attacks, the purview of the Department of Homeland Security, the PATRIOT Act, the death of Osama bin Laden and Fukishima have all been of interest.

Mr Tracy, a tenured professor at Florida Atlantic University, argues that the media and 'play actors' have made up the bombing that left three dead and more than 180 injured.

He takes particular issue with the endless stream of photos supporting the popular belief that the bombing did in fact happen.

He writes that the multitude of pictures 'suggests the possibility of play actors getting into position after the detonation of what may in fact have been a smoke bomb or similarly benign explosive.'

Still at work: James Tracy, 47, has been teaching at Florida Atlantic University for 10 years and refuses to lessen his stance against the official version of events regarding the Sandy Hook shooting

'Since it is mediated, however, and primarily experienced from afar through the careful assemblage of words, images and the official pronouncements and commentary of celebrity journalists, it has the semblance of being, for all practical purposes, "real."’

University officials had a similar reaction to his latest rant as they did for the Newtown shooting.

'As with all postings on his personal blog, Florida Atlantic University does not agree with Mr. Tracy’s views or opinions,' the University spokesman said in a statement to FoxNews.com.

'His editorialized postings do not reflect the positions of the University or its leaders.

'The University stands with the rest of the country in our support of the victims of the Boston Marathon tragedy. We, too, are Boston Strong.'

Placing blame: Tracy says that the national media has not done enough to unearth the 'truth'

One difference between his comments on the Sandy Hook massacre and the Boston bombing was the amount of time that he left in between.

Last time, he waited nearly a month after the 20 young students and six school administrators were killed at the elementary school before making his controversial comments. This time he waited just nine days.

The
47-year-old professor based his outrageous allegations largely on the 
flurry of conflicting media reports that were made as news of the 
shooting was released throughout the tragic day.

'I think that the entire country mourned
about Sandy Hook and yet, once again, the investigation that 
journalistic institutions should have actually carried out never took 
place as far as I'm concerned,' Tracy said at the time.
