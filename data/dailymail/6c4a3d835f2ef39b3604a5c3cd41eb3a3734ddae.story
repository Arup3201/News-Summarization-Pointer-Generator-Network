There's a new problem child at The View, and this time it's NOT Rosie O'Donnell. Well, not exactly.

Sources close the show tell MailOnline that Rosie Perez's diva antics have gone into overdrive.

Perez has become a terror behind the scenes, following the lead of (once) best bud Rosie O'Donnell in berating producers and having blow-ups over segments in the hot topics meeting.

Last week Perez had a major melt down after a hostile, gum-chewing Rosie O treated her with disdain during an on-air segment discussing the rape allegations against Bill Cosby.

Rosie redux:  Rosie Perez has become a terror behind the scenes, following the lead of best bud Rosie O'Donnell in berating producers and having blow-ups over segments in the hot topics meeting

Whoopi wanted to avoid  highly charged topics while Rosie O wanted to attack them with all guns blazing

Professor Cosby: The conversation was anything but educational when The View hosts got together to discuss the allegations of rape against Cosby, who was a keynote speaker at Spelman College last May

Perez had argued that Cosby has been pilloried by social media and that there is no way to prove that the allegations are true. Perez attempted to defend her opinion to O'Donnell but O'Donnell wasn't having it. At all. 

 'You think this is more about social media comments on the allegations, not about the allegations themselves..., said Rosie O, clearly disgusted with the turn of the conversation.a 

After the two debated whether the corporations had the correct response to the Cosby allegations, O'Donnell seemingly expressed her disapproval over Perez's social media commentary.

Whoopi tried to support the frustrated Perez and said, 'Until you know that it's true, it's an allegation.' But Rosie remained unconvinced and hostile.

After the show, Perez then went to the new ABC News executives and told them that Rosie O 'crossed the lines,' during the Cosby debate.  She told them 'I don't know how much longer I can work with her!' 

Rosie Perez 'was very likable at the beginning, but now she's rarely pleased with the topics, often complains and fusses at producers constantly,' a show insider explained.

In another recently reported incident, Rosie Perez was in tears as Whoopi Goldberg and Rosie O'Donnell duked it out over whether or not they should even discuss the onslaught of women coming forward to claim that Bill Cosby raped and drugged them as well as the racial tension in Ferguson, Mo.

Whoopi wanted to avoid the highly charged topics while Rosie O wanted to attack them with all guns blazing. In a pre-show meeting the squabbling stars aired their differences causing Perez to break down in tears.

Rosie wants her hair to look like J.Lo's.  Emmy winning makeup and hair people who have done J.Lo in the past just can't seem to please Rosie

The View insider also revealed the in-house glam team at the show is fed up with Perez, who is on her sixth makeup artist in two months and does her own hair most days.

'She's so insecure about her looks. She wants her look to emulate Jennifer Lopez's, but the Emmy winning makeup and hair people who have done J.Lo in the past just can't seem to please her,' one insider revealed. 

The View staffers will get a reprieve soon as Perez has to take a few weeks off from The View in January to rehearse for her starring role in the Broadway play Fish in the Dark opposite Larry David that opens in February.

'Everyone is counting down the days until she takes her mini hiatus. She'll be gone at least four weeks and her absence means there's one less diva the team will have to deal with,' the insider added.

ABC News has been looking at a few replacement hosts to fill in the entire time for Perez. Among the contenders are Glee's Naya Rivera, newscaster Jacque Reid, HGTV's Egypt Sherrod and journalist Laura Ling, sister of former View co-host Lisa Ling.
