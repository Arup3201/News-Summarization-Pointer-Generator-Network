Two BBC executives could face the sack over the botched Newsnight investigation that falsely linked Lord McAlpine to child abuse allegations.

The reputation of Newsnight hit a new low last night after a damning report accused the flagship BBC2 programme of failing to carry out ‘basic checks’ on its report.

Disciplinary proceedings began as soon
 the report was delivered to the new BBC management and the BBC Trust, which could result in a decision to sack those responsible.

Both Liz Gibbons, Newsnight's acting 
editor, and Adrian Van Klaveren, the supervising executive seconded from
 his job running Radio 5 Live, were involved with the broadcast and 
could be in the firing line.

BBC Scotland director, Ken 
MacQuarrie, was given the job of heading the investigation and ruled 
there had been an ‘unacceptable’ failure to properly establish the 
veracity of the allegations.

In addition, a ‘highly complex’ 
investigation had been commissioned and screened in a matter of five 
days but no one appeared to know who was in overall charge , the 
internal inquiry found.

The November 2 report had focused on 
historical allegations of abuse at a children’s home and featured two 
victims alleging a leading Conservative politician from the Thatcher era
 had been among the abusers.

Catalyst: The crisis for Lord McAlpine was all started by Newsnight's 'shabby' investigation into abuse at a Welsh children's home

The politician was not named in the 
programme but the coverage prompted a storm on Twitter, with many 
inaccurately naming Lord McAlpine as the perpetrator.

The peer was forced to issue a 
statement denying his involvement, and one of the victims later said the
 person who abused him was not the person he had identified as Lord 
McAlpine.

MacQuarrie’s report said editorial 
failings on that Newsnight included the fact that: ‘Identification of 
the alleged perpetrator was not confirmed by photograph with the first 
victim.

The second victim could not be traced in order to provide up to date corroboration.’

It added that no ‘right of reply’ was offered to the unnamed individual at the centre of the investigation.

MacQuarrie outlined a serious of issues that contributed to the broadcast of the inaccurate edition of Newsnight.

He stated a ‘highly complex’ story went to air very quickly, suggesting not enough time was set aside to properly research it.

It was commissioned on October 28 and was then aired on November 2.

The BBC worked with the Bureau of 
Investigative Journalism on the story, but took ultimate editorial 
responsibility once it was commissioned.

MacQuarrie said the programme’s 
management structure had been ‘seriously weakened’ because editor Peter 
Rippon had stood aside pending an investigation into the shelving of the
 Newsnight investigation into allegations of child abuse against Jimmy 
Savile.

Paying the price: Steve Messham's evidence formed part of the botched programme which resulted in George Entwistle's resignation

A deputy editor had also left the programme – and so the remainder of the team were under ‘very considerable pressure’.

He also found that because it was  
not clear if this programme was ‘regarded as Savile-related’, there was 
confusion over who took ultimate responsibility for the report.

This is because the BBC had been 
operating a two-tier system with one set of executives in charge of 
output relating to Savile, and another set in charge of day-to-day 
programming.

He said: ‘There was a different 
understanding by the key parties about where the responsibility lay for 
the final editorial sign-off for the story on the day.’

A BBC Trust spokesman said: ‘It is 
clear from the MacQuarrie report on the November 2 Newsnight that there 
were serious failures in the normal checks and balances that the Trust 
expects from BBC journalism.’

The corporation said it was now 
reverting to a ‘single chain of command’ on all output – Savile related 
or otherwise – and was installing Karen O’Connor as acting editor of 
Newsnight.
