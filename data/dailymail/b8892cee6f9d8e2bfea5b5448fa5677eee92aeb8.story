Liverpool forward Iago Aspas is set to join Sevilla on a season-long loan.

According to the Liverpool Echo, the 26-year-old is set to move to the Spanish club following a disappointing debut campaign at Anfield.

And there is also still a slim chance that the deal could be made permanent if Liverpool can secure a large chunk of the transfer fee they paid for him last summer.

On the move: Iago Aspas has joined La Liga outfit Sevilla on a season-long loan deal from Liverpool

Struggle: The Liverpool forward had a difficult debut season at the club, scoring just once in 15 games

Aspas' career at the club began well enough, starting their opening Premier League game and providing the assist for Daniel Sturridge in the 1-0 win over Stoke.

But things quickly went downhill from there, as he went on to make just 14 more appearances all season, scoring once against Oldham in the FA Cup.

Liverpool were originally keen to offer Aspas as part of a deal to secure their long-term target Alberto Moreno. But it now appears as though those two deals will be completed separately.
