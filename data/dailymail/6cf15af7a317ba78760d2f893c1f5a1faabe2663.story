Microsoft is still on track to launch its much-rumoured smartwatch this month, after reports suggested the device is imminent.

The Washington-based firm is expected to launch ‘within the next few weeks’ to make sure it’s available in time for Christmas, with rumours suggesting it will have a two-day battery life.

Previous reports stated the device will be cross-platform, meaning it will sync with iOS, Android and Windows-based phones - and it may even have its display on the inside of the wrist.

The Washington-based firm is expected to launch ‘within the next few weeks’ to make sure it’s available in time for Christmas, with rumours suggesting it will have a two-day battery life.

This would make the watch more 'natural' to use, and the screen would be visible by turning the wrist upwards.

The latest claims were reported by Forbes over the weekend, and Microsoft has not yet responded to MailOnline’s request for comment.

Rumours about the device began earlier this year, when a series of patent applications went public.

Both the patents were originally filed back in 2012.

The first, titled Discreetly Displaying Contextually Relevant Information on a display device, shows a smartwatch displaying notifications and GPS navigation.

Nothing has been officially confirmed by Microsoft yet, but previous rumours claim:

The watch will have a removable band that will come in a red, black, yellow and blue.

It will be made of oxynitride aluminium - a translucent form of the metal.

Microsoft's smartwatch is also said to run a version of Windows 8.

Prototypes of the device are being tested by the Surface team and the watch could have the connector featured on the tablet.

A source close to the plans has said the device will launch in October, and it could have its display on the inside of the wrist.

It is also expected to work across multiple platforms, including Android, iOS and Windows PC. 

The second, called Dynamic User Interfaces Adapted to Inferred User Contexts, shows how Microsoft plans to add sensors to track the level of activity the wearer is doing - from sitting down to running.

This second patent also explained that the interface would react to varying activity levels in different ways.

Both patents show wrist worn devices that connect with a phone or other smart device, and are fitted with built-in heart rate monitors, accelerometers and GPS units.

Although this technology is not new, Microsoft's patents pre-date current devices on the market – including Apple’s Watch.

The claims made about Microsoft’s smartwatch battery life, if true, may set it apart from Apple’s proprietary device.

Most existing smartwatches on the market, such as Pebble and MetaWatch, tend to last up to a week on a single charge.

The closest Apple boss Tim Cook came to talking about the battery life for the Watch at an event last month was saying users would ‘charge it at night.’

The company's chief executive added that the Apple Watch ‘can be worn all day, for any occasion,’ but hourly figures were notably absent.

Sources also claimed Microsoft's gadget wouldn't be as bulky as Samsung's range of smartwatches, or the Moto 360. Instead, it is expected to be sleeker, thinner, and more closely resemble a fitness band, such as the Nike Fuelband (pictured) and Fitbit’s Flex

Last month, a patent revealed Microsoft was additionally working on sports watch, with built-in heart rate monitor - but this technology may have been patented for use in its smartwatch

A source said Apple is unhappy with the watch's battery life, while another source confirmed that that the battery life ‘is about a day now.’

The initial rumours about an October launch for Microsoft’s device originated from website Tom’s Hardware, which stated that a ‘trusted source with knowledge of the development’ confirmed the release, and that the phone will work across multiple platforms.

At the moment, Samsung’s range of smartwatches and Apple’s first wearable only work with their own handsets.

Future versions of Microsoft's smartwatch may also feature the firm's Analog Keyboard Project that lets a user draw letters, numbers and even symbols in the middle of watch, which are then registered by the device.

The prototype, reported by Gizmodo, is currently compatible both with square Android watches and the circular Moto 360 so far.

The handwriting method allows the whole screen to be used for each character, rather than classic typing methods where part of the screen must be obscured.

This leaves room on the left for a large backspace button, and on the right for a space bar button.

But for now, only lowercase English letters, numbers and basic punctuation symbols can be used.

Fitness trackers that double up as smartwatches are a hot topic this week, after reports claimed Fitbit was working on a 'superwatch.' The rumoured Fitbit Surge is said to have built-in GPS and heart rate monitor, plus smart notifications, in addition to the pedometer and sleep tracker seen in current models (Fitbit Flex pictured)

According to the latest rumours, there will be 11 sensors inside the firm’s watch including accelerometer, GPS and microphone.

Sources also claimed the gadget wouldn't be as bulky as Samsung's range of smartwatches, or the Moto 360. 

Instead, it is expected to be sleeker, thinner, and more closely resemble a fitness band, such as the Nike Fuelband.
