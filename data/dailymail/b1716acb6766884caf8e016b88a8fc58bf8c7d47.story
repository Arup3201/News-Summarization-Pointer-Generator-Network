Salford owner Marwan Koukash will not walk away from the club and is to enlist the help of Australia's national coach Tim Sheens in an effort to turn around their fortunes.

The multi-millionaire racehorse owner sparked off fevered speculation over his future with the Red Devils in the wake of last Thursday's crushing 52-6 defeat by St Helens in their opening home Super League match of the season by tweeting: 'I have had enough'.

Koukash then went to ground but emerged on Monday to insist he remains fully committed to the club.

He told Press Association Sport that the position of head coach Iestyn Harris is not under threat. Indeed, he will be given 'additional resources' if necessary.

Koukash, who ploughed between £3million and £4million in his first two years in charge of the Salford club, also revealed his plans to bring Sheens over from Australia to provide him with advice and help put new structures in place.

Of his famous tweet, Koukash said: 'I don't want to discuss that publicly. I discussed it with my boys this morning. We had a great meeting and whatever was discussed in house is going to stay private.

'I'm not walking out on the club. We're going to come out fighting.

'I'm going to work harder and if Iestyn wants additional resources he will have them at his disposal.

'And also a friend of mine will be visiting me soon, to look around the club and give me his opinion. I'm not the most experienced person in rugby league - I've only been in the sport for three years - and sometimes I need extra help.

'That friend is Tim Sheens, who will visit me for three weeks and advise me on various bits and pieces and help put some systems and structures into the club.'

Koukash, a regular visitor to Australia, says he expects Sheens to arrive for a pre-arranged visit by the end of the month and insists his presence will not threaten the position of Harris.

'He's not coming for any other reason but to look at the club as a friend to help me out,' Koukash said.
