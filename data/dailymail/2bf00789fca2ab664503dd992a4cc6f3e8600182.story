Arsenal's  squad photo included a trophy for the first time since 2005 as the Gunners squad posed with the FA Cup and Community Shield.

The pictures included all five of the club's summer signings, as well as several youngsters hopeful of first-team football this season. 

Danny Welbeck, who arrived for £16million from Manchester United on transfer deadline day, stands between fellow new signing Calum Chambers and young full-back Hector Bellerin in the second row, while Alexis Sanchez is the only signing to feature on the front row.

Arsenal spent heavily over the summer in the hope of winning the Premie League for the first time since the Invincible season of 2004. 

They ended their nine-year trophy drought last May by beating Hull City at Wembley in extra-time to win the FA Cup.  

The 31-man first team squad also includes the likes of Gedion Zelalem, Chuba Akpom and Isaac Hayden, who will be hoping to make an impact on Arsene Wenger's thinking as the season progresses.

Zelalem, 17, was the first player born after Arsene Wenger took over the club to play for Arsenal, while Akpom, 18, set the club record for the 10m sprint last week. 

Both players featured for Arsenal Under-21s against Aston Villa on Thursday night, with Akpom scoring twice in a 2-0 win.
