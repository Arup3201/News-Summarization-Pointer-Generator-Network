What an absolute joke that was. It should never have reached the stage where they were involving lawyers, defendants and witnesses, like some serious court case. It was like Fred Karno’s circus!

A bloke’s been pushed, for goodness’ sake. And it didn’t even happen on the field of play.

That would have been different, but why they’ve made such a song and dance over this, God only knows.

In terms of sledging, I don’t see Jimmy Anderson as being any worse than most fast bowlers to have played the game. If a few words are a crime, then guys like Fred Trueman, Sarfraz Nawaz, Merv Hughes and Glenn McGrath would never have got a game.

Farce: Charges that James Anderson physically assaulted Ravindra Jadeja were thrown out

Spat: Anderson and Jadeja were embroiled in a row as they left the Trent Bridge pitch

It’s a Test match — not the dinner queue at primary school. Man up!

Shake hands and move on, which is what they’ve done after each Test so far. After all, it wasn’t as if Anderson flattened Jadeja in full view of the crowd.

People have asked me whether this is good for England, but I think it’s good for cricket.

Waste of time: Charges against India all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja were also dropped after the hearing

It’s 1-1, and things will be tasty at Old Trafford, which is how it should be. It absolutely beggars belief that it even got to this stage.

I think it was right that Ravindra Jadeja’s charge was overturned too.

But I can’t help thinking he should take his tattoos and ear-rings back home to his aunty and get on with the game! It’s all anyone cares about.
