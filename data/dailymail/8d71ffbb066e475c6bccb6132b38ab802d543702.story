Arsenal vice-captain Mikel Arteta has hit back at Jose Mourinho for the ‘specialist in failure’ jibe he aimed at Arsene Wenger.

Ahead of Saturday’s FA Cup final against Hull, Arteta strongly defended the Arsenal manager and insisted the Chelsea boss’s scathing comments in February were baseless.

‘If you analyse everything he has done for this club, if he is a failure — I have a different opinion.

Specialist in failure: Mourinho has criticised Wenger this season, but Arsenal could have the last laugh

‘I don’t like it when someone criticises any of my team-mates, the staff, the manager, the club.

‘When they are right, maybe you can accept that everybody makes mistakes. But when he (Mourinho) comes in a certain way, I don’t like it. We don’t need to answer to anybody.’

However, Arteta has questioned Arsenal’s policy of offering only 12-month contracts to players over 30.

The 32-year-old, who will discuss his future with Wenger after the final, has a year left on his contract but was not part of the renewal drive that led to Per Mertesacker, Santi Cazorla, Aaron Ramsey and Laurent Koscielny signing new deals.

Arteta said: ‘I don’t value players by age, whether it is Tomas Rosicky or Jack Wilshere.

‘I analyse many other things before age. For the club, age can be an asset. For me, a much bigger asset is someone who has played over 125 games in three years, compared to someone who has played 25 and is 20.

Age doesn't matter: Arteta says he judges the likes of Rosicky and Wilshere the same, despite age differences

‘I understand the club’s point of view: “Mikel is not a £25million player because he is not 22 any more”. But I know what I can give.’

Meanwhile, Samuel Eto’o has called time on his career at Chelsea after labelling Mourinho a ‘fool’ for a  jibe about his age.

In February, Mourinho was filmed by French TV saying: ‘Eto’o is 32 years old, maybe 35, who knows?’

Mocking: Eto'o reacted to his manager's suggestion that he is old by using the corner flag as a walking stick

But Eto’o, whose contract expires next month, hit back yesterday, saying: ‘I am 33 years old. And it is not because a fool called me an old man that you must believe it.

‘And you may have noticed that the old man was better than the youngsters.’
