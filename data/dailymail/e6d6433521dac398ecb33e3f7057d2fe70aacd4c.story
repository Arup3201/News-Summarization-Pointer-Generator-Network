Liverpool are on the brink of signing Rickie Lambert after they launched a shock £4million bid for the England striker.

Brendan Rodgers is determined to add depth to his squad but the move for boyhood Reds fan  Lambert has come from left field.

Brazil bound: Lambert is currently training with England ahead of the World Cup next month

The 32-year-old is 
with the England squad preparing for Friday's game with Peru, but he is
 expected to be allowed to travel to Liverpool on Saturday for a medical 
and the switch from Southampton could be completed early next week.

The 
initial £4m fee will rise according to the appearances he makes.

Lambert,
 who began his career at Liverpool’s academy, will be the first major 
arrival in what is expected to be a busy summer for the club.

He could 
even be followed by two of his  team-mates from Southampton, as 
Liverpool are still negotiating for £30m-rated Adam Lallana and have 
also targeted Dejan Lovren to bolster their defence.

Odds on: A flurry of bets had been placed on Rickie Lambert joining Liverpool on Thursday

                                                       Appearances/Goals

1998–2000 Blackpool                 3           0

2001–2002 Macclesfield Town    44           8

2002–2005 Stockport County  98           18

2005–2006 Rochdale                 64           28

2006–2009 Bristol Rovers      128          51

2009–         Southampton          207         106

They have also bid £16million for Sevilla left-back Alberto
Moreno and could send Spanish midfielder Suso in the opposite direction to
complete that deal, as Rodgers looks to bring in the numbers they will need to
cope with competing in the Barclays Premier League and the Champions League.

Moreno, who has been watched by both Manchester clubs, is
Liverpool's number one target to strength a position that has given Rodgers
problems in the last 12 months.

Lallana's move has been held up by the fact Bournemouth are
owed a 25 per cent sell-on fee and Liverpool have Bayern Munich's Xherdan
Shaqiri as alternative.

Emre Can, the Germany Under-21 international, is another
target and Liverpool remain in talks with him over a £12million move from Bayer
Leverkusen.

Ambition: Lambert will be the first major arrival in what is expected to be a busy period for Liverpool

On the move: Southampton striker Rickie Lambert is on the brink of a £4million move to Liverpool

Happy days: Rickie's sister Melanie revealed family joy although the tweet was no longer available later

Yet it is the deal for Lambert – who was released by
Liverpool when he was 15 famously worked in a beetroot factory – that has come
as such surprise but Rodgers has always been a fan.

'I think Rickie is a terrific player,' said Rodgers last
September before Liverpool faced Southampton at Anfield. 'I sent him a message,
a fax, when he made his England debut (against Scotland) as I know he is a big
Red. I sent it on behalf of the club and all Kopites.

'He is a Kirkby boy and I was just wishing him well, saying
we were all proud of him playing for England.'

Target: Liverpool are still in talks with Southampton for £30million-rated Adam Lallana

Rodgers added: 'People look back now and say it was a
mistake (to let Lambert go), but there may have been something at the time that
was a factor.

'He just might not have been ready for what Liverpool was at
that time, but there is absolutely no doubt within development it cannot just
be about what the player is now. With young talent you always have to look at
what they could be.

'You see so many young British players who are thrown to the
garbage because maybe they are not strong or they are not quick when they are
going through growth spurts. The emphasis at younger ages should be technique.
But I have been a big admirer of Rickie.'

Lambert worked for four months in a factory putting lids on beetroot jars when he was released by Blackpool in 2000 before going on to play for Macclesfield and Stockport.

His incredible rise to fame began when Rochdale boss Steve Parkin moved him from midfield. 

Parkin recalled: 'I took him from Stockport for not much and shoved him straight up front.

Career move: Lambert's incredible rise happened after he was shoved up front at Rochdale

'First and foremost he was a big lad. I noticed he had a terrific shot and he was good in the air, either playing off someone or being a target man.

'I didn't think he'd come good in midfield, but he had exceptional touch and ability. He can see a move two or three passes before it happens so he's always one step ahead. He always had the ability to play up front but his midfield mindset makes him good at dropping off.' 

Lambert, aged 23 at the time, forged a formidable partnership with Grant Holt and they scored 27 goals in 24 matches before Holt was poached by Nottingham  Forest.

But it got Lambert noticed, too, by Bristol Rovers director of football Lennie Lawrence. After one season he moved there for £200,000.

'It took four months to get him fit,' said Lawrence, now assistant manager at Bolton. 

'He had all sorts of different little ailments, minor things. After we got him fit - boom.

'We always knew he could score. He strikes the ball so powerfully and he knows how to use his body, he's a clever player. He's a great lad. Unassuming, terrific, never arrogant. Just a bloody good lad and very popular.' 

Southampton signed him for £1million in 2009 and he has been top scorer every season since.
