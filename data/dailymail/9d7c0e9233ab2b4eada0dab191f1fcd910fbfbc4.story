Disgraced: Lance Armstrong, pictured after his seventh Tour de France win, is facing criminal charges in Spain

Disgraced former cycling champion Lance Armstrong is facing criminal charges in Spain over his use of performance-enhancing drugs.

Armstrong, who was stripped of his Tour de France titles and banned from competing over doping, is now being investigated by Spanish authorities.

They are looking into whether Armstrong committed doping offences in Spain while cycling for the U.S. Postal Service cycling team. 

It is not a crime in Spain for an athlete to use performance enhancing drugs for personal use but it is an offence if investigators can prove 'trafficking, distribution and commercialisation of doping drugs', which carries up to two years in prison and fines of up to 400,000 euros.

Armstrong lived in Girona, Spain, for several years during the height of his career which saw him win the Tour de France a record-breaking seven times between 1999 and 2005.

Armstrong's former cycling teammate Floyd Landis told ABC News that he babysat Armstrong's 'blood fridge' while he was living in Spain in 2004 with the singer Sheryl Crow 'to make sure the temperature remained constant' when the former couple went away.

The investigation is ongoing in multiple regions of Spain, including Alicante, Valencia, Girona and Tenerife, sources told ABC News.

They added that the investigation is at a 'very active and sensitive' phase.

Spain has been seen as soft on sports
doping in the past but has been working to change that image as it bids
for the 2020 Olympics.

Drugs cheat: Lance Armstrong always denied allegations that he used performance enhancing drugs

The director of Spain's anti-doping 
authority, Ana Munoz, said in a German TV interview: 'What I can tell 
you so far is that we are following up on the Armstrong case.

'Not only because we were involved in the investigation back then but also because we are really interested that every person, Spanish or not, who has committed a crime in our country be prosecuted.'

This latest investigation comes after a U.S. Anti Doping Agency report on Armstrong's doping activities.

For years, Armstrong denied using performance-enhancing drugs.

Confession: But the cycling champion finally admitted he had doped prior to each of his Tour de France wins on the Oprah Winfrey show in January

But last year, USADA released a report 
that detailed extensive doping on his seven Tour de France-winning teams
and stripped him of those titles.

Armstrong then admitted last month in an interview with 'Queen of Talk' Oprah Winfrey that he doped and used performance-enhancing drugs to win those races.

Armstrong is now facing several legal challenges from his former sponsors and team mates.

The cyclist has also been sued by a Dallas-based SCA Promotions to recover more than $12million in bonuses.

Armstrong's legal representative did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
