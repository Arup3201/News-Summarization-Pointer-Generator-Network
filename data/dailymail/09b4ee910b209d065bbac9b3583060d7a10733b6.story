Arsenal are set to make an £8million bid for Ipswich defender Tyrone Mings in January if they lose out to Manchester United in the chase for   German international Mats Hummels.

Bundesliga side Borussia Dortmund are holding out for £32million for their World Cup-winning centre back. 

Gunners boss Arsene Wenger has long targeted Hummels but the fee could be excessive for Arsenal, more so than Louis van Gaal's side.

Mings, who started his career at Southampton, is regarded as one of the best young defenders outside the Premier League.

He can play at both left back and centre half and could well be the player Wenger opts for to bolster his defence in January.

The news that Charlie Austin is not being rushed into signing a new deal worth in excess of £60,000 a week at QPR has alerted both Liverpool and Tottenham.

Meanwhile, West Ham are saying publicly they want to keep Andy Carroll, but an offer of £20m for the enigmatic striker will see the Hammers sell. Carroll's £85,000-a-week wages remain a sticking point in any potential move away from Upton Park. 

West Ham midfielder Alex Song, who is on loan from Barcelona for the season, will be a target for both Manchester City and Liverpool next summer.

I AM HEARING: 

That one leading Premier League club is paying parents between £1,000 and £2,000 a month to lure their sons - some as young as eight years old - to join their academy rather than a rival one.

I AM ALSO HEARING: 

Dennis Bergkamp is under consideration to succeed Liam Brady as head of development and the academy at Arsenal.

I BET:

Chelsea are 1-6 on with Coral to win the Premier League. That's about as done and dusted as you get. But there is value in backing the Blues to achieve a league and Champions League double - Paddy Power offer 11-2

For Jose Mourinho's side to to the treble of Premier League, Champions League and FA Cup, William Hill offer 25-1.

BTW: 

The immediate pressure on David Moyes at Real Sociedad was lifted on Friday night when his new club beat Elche 3-0 with former Arsenal striker Carlos Vela scoring a hat-trick.

But there seems to be an anti-Moyes agenda judging by how a Spanish film shot a mini fly-on-the-wall 'pastiche' of Moyes the previous week.

The footage mocked Moyes for not knowing the names of his players, which seemed a bit unfair.

But Moyes appeared a fool when he pranced around the technical area and kept shouting to his players when they were on the ball, in Scot–English 'play, play'.

'Play, play?' - as opposed to what?

Besides, in any language the instructions sounded more like ranting than coaching. 

I SAY:

Jack Wilshere has suffered another injury. Is it a weakness in the player that he is susceptible to getting crocked so often? Or is there a deeper problem with Arsenal's 'fitness' regime given the slightest knock seems to sideline many of their players all too frequently?

I suspect an obsession with 'sport science' - body fat mass and all that - means that a combative player like Wilshere actually has less 'human sponge' to project his joints and muscles than say Ray Parlour, who was a trojan for Gunners.
