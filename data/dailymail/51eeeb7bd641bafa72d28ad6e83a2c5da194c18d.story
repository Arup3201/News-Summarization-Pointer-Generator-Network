Not so long ago the idea of tourist day trips to the edge of space and back was dismissed as hot air.

But tickets have just gone on sale for the ultimate balloon flight to see the wonders of our planet from 19 miles up.

An American firm yesterday announced plans to take eight passengers to within touching distance of space inside a gondola attached to a helium balloon in 2016.

Views: Passengers will be able to see the curvature of the Earth

Even though the balloon’s space-age basket will be pressurised those on board might want to hold their breath when paying for their prized seat.

The flight, lasting less than eight and a half hours, will cost £45,500.

They will however be able to see Earth’s curvature and experience a few moments of weightlessness – as well as sup a cocktail at the bar and beam back ‘selfies’ with the stars to their envious social media friends thanks to the on-board wi-fi.

‘We want to give people the experience of seeing the Earth from space for hours and contemplating the curvature of the planet and all that comes with that,’ said Jane Poynter, chief executive of the Arizona-based company World View Enterprises.

The 40 million cubic-foot (1.1 million cubic-meter) balloon will take off from Sir Richard Branson’s spaceport in the New Mexico desert.

The craft will take two hours to reach its maximum cruising height of about 100,000ft and where the sky turns dark.

It will then cruise across the stratosphere to allow the starry-eyed passengers to gape in wonder at the blue planet below, our galaxy and the wider universe.

The gondola will then disconnect from the balloon and return to earth under a para-wing.

Space proper starts at 62 miles but the passengers will experience a few seconds of weightlessness during the rapid 20-minute controlled descent, said Poynter.

The craft will stop a few miles short of the point reached last year by the Austrian Felix Baumgartner, 44, who set the world’s skydiving record by jumping from a helium balloon 24 miles above Earth.

‘Think of this as a super-first-class high-end luxury experience,’ said Poynter’s husband, Taber McCallum, the company’s chief technology officer, who used to design life support systems for Nasa.

The couple spent two years as ‘bionauts’ sealed inside a simulated space station in the Arizona desert in the 1990s, an experiment that shaped scientific thinking about man living on Mars.

There company is only one of several racing to offer regular tourist space trips, among them SpaceShipTwo, a suborbital six-passenger, two-pilot vehicle owned by Virgin Galactic, an offshoot of Richard Branson’s Virgin Group.

‘Ten years ago this was all science fiction,’ said  Burt Rutan, who designed SPACESHIPONE, the first private craft to fly into space in 2004 and the prototype for Branson’s new fleet currently under construction.

‘Now it’s an engineer’s everyday fact,’ he said.
