A lot has been made of Louis van Gaal's long ball tactics at Manchester United recently, but at one of his former clubs Bayern Munich that art has become an impressive skill.

Bayern duo Mario Gotze and Holger Badstuber showcased their impressive ability on the ball as they pinged some long-range passes into each other during a training session.

The pair's skills were all the more impressive as they controlled the fizzing passes instantaneously before indulging in some kick-ups too.

Badstuber is slowly making his comeback into the German giants first-team plans after injuring his thigh in a 2-0 win at home to Stuttgart in the Bundesliga in September last year.

While the 25-year-old isn't expected to feature for Bayern just yet, the same can't be applied to Gotze who has played an integral part in their season so far.

The Germany World Cup winner has scored seven goals in 19 league matches this season for the table-toppers.

Ahead of Saturday's match at home to Hamburg, boss Pep Guardiola was given a boost with the return of both winger Franck Ribery and defender Rafinha to his squad.

The pair had been out injured for the last few weeks as Bayern stuttered in the new year.

The German champions had been near flawless in the first half of the campaign, but have managed just one win in their opening three league games so far.

'Franck Ribery and Rafinha are back and they trained with the team,' Guardiola told a news conference. 'They are fit and they are an option.'

The Spaniard will not have suspended central defender Jerome Boateng at his disposal as they look to build on last week's 2-0 win at VfB Stuttgart.

In their last four visits to the Allianz Arena alone, Hamburg have conceded a staggering 23 goals, including a 9-2 demolition in 2013.
