Harry Kane stole the show as Tottenham beat Arsenal 2-1 at White Hart Lane but both teams' playmakers also left their mark on the game.

Arsene Wenger spoke before the north London derby about a desire for his team to play with lucidity. While most of his players struggled to achieve this, for one player on the White Hart Lane pitch the machinations of the game seemed clear.

Mesut Ozil has started three games since returning from injury, in all three he played on the left, in all three he scored.

While the in-form Santi Cazorla failed to have a significant impact on the game, his German team-mate wasted no time influencing the match.

With 11 minutes gone, Danny Welbeck crossed for Olivier Giroud, the Frenchman scuffed his shot but Ozil had lost Kyle Walker at the back post and calmly volleyed into the back of the net.

To suggest Ozil had anticipated his team-mate's mistake would be a hard sell but that shouldn't detract from his opener. One of his strengths is his ability to find space - whether he's playing in the centre or on the left - and it was that ability that earned him the goal.

But from there on Arsenal retreated and it was his opposite number that took control.

CHRISTIAN ERIKSEN                                                                                                 MESUT OZIL 

Christian Eriksen - who arrived just in north London just two days before Ozil in 2013 - has enjoyed, statistically, a more impressive season so far. 

And while the former Ajax man failed to add to his tally of 11 goals for the season, he played a crucial role as Tottenham dominated possession.  

He spent most of the first half on the left attempting to exploit weaknesses in full back Hector Bellerin's game. His presence caused problems for the La Masia graduate but Spurs ended the half trailing. 

The second half was a different story. Spurs dominated from the off, and Eriksen played a huge part in that. His passing may not have possessed its normal accuracy but Eriksen but he covered a huge amount of ground throughout the game, and only one offensive midfielder or forward won more duels than him during the match.

Eriksen (48) made almost double the amount of passes as Ozil (25) during the clash, won more duels, and made more recoveries.

The Arsenal man was, though, more clinical. He scored with his only shot of the game and had superior pass accuracy throughout.
