These implausible towers of irregularly shaped stones seem as if they should tumble as soon as you look at them. Rising in the picturesque wilderness they could almost be the work of fairies, mischievously placed to confuse passers-by who chance upon them.

Artist Miha Brinovec, 43, from Braslovce, Slovenia, does not use any adhesives to stick together the rocks. Instead, he carefully calculates how best to balance his stones in the most surprising ways. The amateur photographer insists the practice helps him to meditate and feel closer to nature.

'It is all about the connection between water, rocks and me,' he says. 'I just pick some random rocks and one unusual stone for the top of the installation and the process can begin. 

'Mathematically, I have to find three points on each stone so it can stand still. But this is much more than just mathematics - it is a way of meditating and connecting with nature. When the connection is right the magic happens, gravity surrenders and the whole place becomes balanced and peaceful.'

Precarious: These improbably balanced towers of stones, which appear to defy gravity, are the work of a Slovenian artist

Ethereal: Rising from unlikely spots in Slovenia's beautiful wilderness, it's as though they have been left by visitors from another world

Painstaking: Miha Brinovec carefully balances the rocks into these incredible and seemingly impossible compositions

Work: Mr Brinovec has travelled across the picturesque central European country to seek out beauty spots for his installations and photos

Double trouble: Mr Brinovec starting making his balancing artworks when he lost his job as a commercialist for a logistics firm three years ago

Finely balanced: Mr Brinovec does not use any glue to stick his sculptures together, instead he calculates how they can best balance

Beauty spot: Water rushes through rapids and past an intricately balanced sculpture by Mr Brinovec

'I like the challenge of trying different things and I always wonder whether it's going to work or not,' said Mr Brinovec

Gravity defying: Another of Mr Brinovec's sculptures which appears as though it should simply collapse rather than stand proudly

How does he do it? Many of Mr Brinovec's compositions, like this one, will leave observers scratching their heads as to how they are achieved

Top heavy: The amateur photographer insists that making his towers helps him to meditate and feel closer to nature
