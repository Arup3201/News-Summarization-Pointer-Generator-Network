A video of two unsuspecting fast food employees who were the victims of a practical joke pulled by an Australian YouTuber has gone viral.

So far the clip - which lasts for almost four minutes - of Tyson Williams performing the prank call has attracted more than 160,000 views.

It involves Williams putting two Domino's Pizza employees on the phone to each other using the 'merge calls' function on his mobile phone.

A video of a Brisbane man pranking two Domino's Pizza employees has gone viral

In the footage, the Brisbane man dials the number of Domino's Pizza in Forest Lake - south of the Queensland capital - on his iPhone.

A pizza chain employee named 'Ron' greets him and prepares to take his pick-up order.

Williams - whose friend is having trouble keeping his amused laughter at bay off-camera - orders two deep pan pepperoni pizzas, two thin 'n' crispy Hawaiian pizzas, two cheesy breads and a 1.25-litre bottle of coke under the name of 'Rogan'.

At one point, it looks like Williams is about to break his facade and lose his composure, but he keeps it together and tells Ron to hold on - saying he has to ask his friend what dessert he wants to order.

While Ron is on hold, Williams then dials the number of the Acacia Ridge branch - also in Brisbane's south - of Domino's Pizza.Â 

Tyson Williams posted the video on YouTube and so far it has had more than 160,000 views

Two employees - one from the Acacia Ridge store (pictured) and one from the Forest Lake store - were victims of the prank

A 'Rhiannon' answers the phone and asks him: 'Would you like pick-up or delivery?'

Williams tells her to hold and proceeds to take Ron off hold, and asks him to read the order back - but not before Williams merges the calls so Rhiannon thinks Ron is the one placing the order.

What ensues is a lot of confusion on the part of both employees who don't realise that neither is placing an order, but trying to take an order.

This is where Williams and his friend really start to get a kick out of the prank - trying to stifle their laughter.

In the footage, Williams and his friend cannot contain their delight at the prank

After the prank, Williams and his friend burst out laughing, and jump up and down with joy

After about two minutes, the employees finally figure out what is going on.

'So you haven't called me?' Rhiannon said.

Ron confirmed that he didn't and then added: 'Sounds like someone is stuffing us around.'

The video ends with the employees hanging up, and Williams and his friend finally being able to laugh out loud freely.
