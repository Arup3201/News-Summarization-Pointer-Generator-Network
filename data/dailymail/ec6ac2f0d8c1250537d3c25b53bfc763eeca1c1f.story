A woman who had a threesome with her two lovers to reward them after they murdered her husband has been sentenced to life in jail.

Joanna Grabowski arranged for her lover Jacek Pawlak, 42, and his friend Lukasz Kaminski, 31, to kill her husband, disabled Piotr Grabowski, 31, after he refused to allow her to bring a lover back to the house.

Piotr was a well-known and popular man in the city of Olsztyn in north-eastern Poland who did a lot for charity.

Jailed: Joanna Grabowski (pictured with her children) arranged for her lover Jacek Pawlak, 42, and his friend Lukasz Kaminski, 31, to kill her husband, disabled Piotr Grabowski, 31, after he refused to allow her to bring a lover back to the house

He was an active member of the Catholic aid charity Caritas and it was there that he met Joanna, 30, who was getting financial assistance from the charity to help her with her five children.

The couple had started dating and eventually married, and he had been an enthusiastic stepfather for her five children, but when she told him that she had found a lover and wanted to bring him back to the family home, he told her that he wouldn't allow it.

As a result she arranged for Pawlak and Kaminski to kill him when he went to get some fresh air in a local park.

Victim: Piotr Graboswki's body was found in a park by passersby

The court heard that she had called them on her mobile phone and told them he was coming, allowing them to hide in the bushes in advance. And as he passed by they dragged him from the wheelchair and strangled him with a trouser belt.

Joanna then rewarded them afterwards by inviting them back to the house for sex while her dead husband's body was left lying in the park. 

He was later found by other park visitors who noticed the abandoned wheelchair and then found the body.

Police who were suspicious when interviewing the woman about her husband's death managed to unravel the complicated love triangle by looking at telephone records, and after questioning all three eventually extracted a confession that resulted in the court case.

And now the woman has been jailed for 25 years for the murder of her husband. Sentencing of the lovers was delayed pending reports.

The woman's five children have all been taken into care.
