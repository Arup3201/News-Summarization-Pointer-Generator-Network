Police wrongly categorised reports of Andrew Kemp's violence towards his girlfriend, Leighann Wightmann, who he went to kill in a knife attack 

Police failed to act on reports that a convicted rapist had attacked his girlfriend, who he then went to kill, a damning report has found.

Andrew Kemp, 48, was jailed for life for murdering Leighann Wightman in 2012 after he stabbed her eight times in a vicious attack.

But a review of the case was ordered after it emerged at his trial that Kemp was a convicted rapist who had also been prosecuted over the murder of a woman in Scotland.

A report by South Nottinghamshire Community Safety Partnership has now found that Ms Wightman had reported Kemp's violence in 2008.

It criticised police and seven other agencies, including a local NHS Trust, for failing to share information that could have saved the 24-year-old's life.

Fuelled by drink and jealous rage, Kemp burst into Ms Wightman's home in Netherfield, near Nottingham in 2011, amid claims she had sent flirty texts to a friend.

CCTV revealed he was in the house for 14 minutes after which she was found with 27 knife injuries. Kemp had left her to die in a bedroom.

It later emerged that has also been accused of battering to death Scottish grandmother Nora Smith and setting fire to her home in 1993.

Under Scottish law, a not proven verdict was given in the case and police never reopened the inquiry.

But despite his record, when Ms Wightman reported Kemp's violence in 2008, police left her alone with her soon-to-be killer.

Making 44 recommendations for future treatment, the new report demanded that domestic abuse cases be given more attention in future.

The report read: 'The (initial) incident was incorrectly graded and not "tagged" as domestic abuse: urgent grading would have been appropriate in this case.

'Attempts should have been made to contact Victim A [Ms Wightman] directly to check on her welfare when the address was visited in the early hours of that morning and there is no reference as to whether Victim A may have required medical attention.'

Ms Wightman reported Kemp's violence to police in 2008 but authorities underestimated the risk he posed

It added: 'Officers [must be] reminded that when attending a domestic incident involving cross allegations they should fully investigate each allegation, examine whether justifiable force has been used in self-defence and evaluate each party's complaint separately.'

Nottinghamshire Health Care NHS Trust was offered seven points of advice, which include ensuring that domestic abuse training is mandatory for all staff. 

The review panel also said there is a need for better sharing of information between agencies and ensuring that interventions are made.

Following the report's publication, Anthony May, Nottinghamshire County Council's corporate director for children, families and cultural services, said: 'We fully accept the report's findings and have already implemented the recommendations.'

Superintendent Helen Chamberlain, head of public protection for the police, said of the recommendations: 'The force has already implemented and resolved all but one, and the final one [relating to a database review] is currently undergoing development.'
