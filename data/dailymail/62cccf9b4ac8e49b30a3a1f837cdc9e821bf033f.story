An 18-year-old girl suffering an ultra-rare and life-threatening condition requires treatment with the 'world's most expensive drug' to survive - at the staggering cost of $24,000 per fortnight, none of which is subsidised by Medicare or the Australian Government.

Gold Coast teen Bianca Scott is one of just 70 Australians who suffer from the rare genetic disease atypical haemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS). Caused by a problem in the immune system, it can result in blood clots that can destroy internal organs.

The illness is both debilitating and deadly, and Miss Scott requires frequent hospital visits where she receives the drug Soliris, which effectively stalls the disease and can even repair chronic kidney damage. The treatment costs Ms Scott's mother Tammy Hamawi $24,000 per fortnightly dose.

Bianca Scott was diagnosed with a rare condition called aHUS when she was seven months old, it reappeared late last year

Since her diagnosis, Bianca has spent most of her time in hospital in Brisbane, where she undergoes dialysis and plasma transfusions

Ms Hamawi has given up her job running her own mentoring and business consultancy company to care for her daughter, and all of her money, as well as money from her family, friends, even Bianca's school has gone into providing the life-saving treatment, a drug named Soliris.

'Without a doubt Soliris is the most expensive drug in the world,' said Ms Hamawi. 'It is the only treatment in the whole world for aHUS.'

Bianca was diagnosed with aHUS, which can strike at any age, when she was seven months old. She then found out then that her uncle had died of the disease as a child.

Unusually, the illness lay dormant in Bianca before resurfacing late last year, just a few weeks after she finished high school.

So far Ms Hamawi has been able to pay for five courses of the treatment, with help from her family and from donations

Soliris is currently available at a subsidised rate for people suffering with another ultra-rare disease, called paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH) through the Life Saving Drugs Program (LSDP).

It was being considered by the LSDP as a treatment for aHUS when the LSDP was put under review by the federal government earlier this year.

The drug was then moved for consideration to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC).

The PBAC recommended that Soliris be subsidised under the Pharmaceutical Benefit Scheme for sufferers of aHUS, though there are still several bureaucratic steps to go through before any subsidy will come into effect.

Kirsten Bruce, a representative of the aHUS Patient Support Group Australia said that the PBAC recommendation leaves many questions unanswered.

Of particular concern, she says, is that under the proposed conditions, patients will only be eligible for the drug is they are currently experiencing a flare-up of the condition, and will only be allowed to take the drug for six months after they have recovered from the attack, even though it is recommended that sufferers remain on the drug for the duration of their lives.

'Sufferers want to know who will qualify for Soliris, whether they'll be able to stay on it long-term, there are so many question marks,' she said.

'The tragedy is there's a drug that's available, that works, and it sits on pharmacy shelves, the doctors want to be able to prescribe it but they can't.'

A spokesperson for the Federal Department of Health confirmed that it was currently in negotiations with Alexion, who hold the patent for the drug.

Alexion were contacted for comment.

'Mum noticed symptoms and she took me to hospital and they told me the aHUS had come back. Since then I was faced with this terrible battle,' she said.

'I couldn't keep any food down, I was always vomiting, I couldn't stand up, I'd feel very dizzy, I had fevers… sadly I have chronic kidney failure now.'

She required an endless run of hospital visits – with Bianca requiring eight-hour stretches of dialysis three to four days a week, as well as plasma infusions – before Ms Hamawi heard of Soliris.

'Thank God for Google!' she said.

Ms Hamawi was able to fund five doses of the drug, with the help of her family and friends, and two further doses were bought using donations, including a $19,000 donation from Bianca's school and an anonymous $10,000 donation.

'I am so grateful for that,' said Bianca. 'I thank everyone for that.'

Since starting on Soliris on Valentine's Day, Bianca has turned a corner.

She still requires dialysis, but the plasma infusions, which she describes as 'weird' and 'scary' have stopped, her hours in hospital have significantly decreased and she is feeling much better.

Her blood tests are also showing vastly improved results, with the nephrologist telling Bianca on Monday that if her results continue in the direction they're going she might be able to come off dialysis.

But with the cost of Soliris currently so high, it was cost $680,000 a year to keep her on the drug, Bianca and her mother do not have the money to buy their next dose, which Bianca is due to take on Thursday June 19.

Without Soliris, Bianca will likely deteriorate, and if left too long, the damage to her kidney will be so severe that she will have to remain on dialysis for the rest of her life.

'She's 17, can you imagine a lifetime of chronic kidney failure? And when I say a lifetime, it's not going to be a long life,' said Ms Hamawi.

Ms Hamawi is frustrated at Alexion, the U.S. company that produce Soliris and own the patent for the drug.

'On the one hand $680,000 a year to save your child's life is a big price, it's too high,' she said.

However, most of her anger is directed at the Australian government, which she says is 'a system that we thought was there to protect and look after us [and] has in a way let us down'.

'It baffles me how could you justify fuelling aeroplanes to go and look for an aeroplane that’s who knows where. But when someone needs mediciine, and it is the only medicine that is available, you sit there and negotiate and it might take six months,' she said.
