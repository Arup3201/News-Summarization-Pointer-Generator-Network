President Barack Obama welcomed his newly-elected counterpart Francois Hollande to the White House today – while his wife Michelle hosts the French president’s twice-divorced girlfriend.

When the leaders of the G8 nations gather at Camp David tomorrow, Mrs Obama will treat their spouses to a tour of the White House and a meal made from produce grown in her White House vegetable garden.

Then leaders and spouses will de-camp to Chicago for the largest Nato summit in the organisation's history – some 60 countries will be represented. The spouses will get a tour of the Gary Comer Youth Center on the South Side, where Mrs Obama grew up, and a dinner at the Art Institute of Chicago.

Touchdown: Valerie Trierweiler arrives at Dulles International Airport in Chantilly, Virginia with French President Francois Hollande

During last year’s G8 summit in Deauville, France, it was a pregnant Carla Bruni-Sarkozy who received the wives, and one husband, of the heads of states and governments. This time in Washington and Chicago all eyes will be on Valerie Trierweiler.

A journalist and a twice-divorced mother of three teenage boys, Trierweiler, 47, was hosting a weekly interview show on a minor French TV network until just a few months ago. She is best known as a political writer at the magazine Paris Match, where she has worked for two decades.

When she appeared for her boyfriend’s swearing in at the Elysee Palace, clad in a black chiffon dress, nude tights, high heels and white coat, she drew comment for outshining the relatively dowdy Bruni.

When the wind caught her split skirt to reveal an eye-catching glimpse of thigh, it was clear that the Bruni era was over every bit as much as the Sarkozy one following Francois Sarkozy’s defeat by the socialist Hollande.

Although Michelle Obama was a high-powered lawyer and hospital executive in Chicago and understands the pressure of juggling work and family life, her background is very different from that of Trierweiler.

Hollande broke up with Segolene Royal, his political ally lover for 30 years and the mother of his four children, after she discovered his affair with Trierweiler.

Married just once, with two daughters rather than four sons, Mrs Obama’s life has been a model of stability compared to Trierweiler’s.

It remains to be seen whether Mrs Obama will miss Bruni, whom she bonded with so strongly that she apparently felt comfortable enough to confide that she found life in the White House ‘hell’ – though aides on both sides of the Atlantic denied she ever said this.

Mrs Obama and Trierweiler share humble beginnings. The fifth of six children, Trierweiler was raised in a council house. Her father, a clerk, had lost a leg after standing on a landmine in 1944 when he was 12.

The father of the future First Lady of the United States was a city water plant employee who suffered from multiple sclerosis. Her mother, who now lives in the White House and looks after her grand-daughters, was a catalogue store secretary.

Both women have been passionate defenders of their other halves. Mrs Obama once confronted black talk show host Tavis Smiley after he had moderated a debate to demand: ‘Why are you messing with Barack?'

‘You were unfairly tough on Barack. You should know as a black man what he’s up against and what he’s trying to do.’

During the French election, Trierweiler was dubbed ‘the Tweetweiler’ because of her use of Twitter to deliver frequent barbs. 

She has also hit back at the way she has been portrayed. When her own magazine put her on the cover with the headline ‘Hollande's Charming Asset’, she tweeted: ‘Bravo Paris Match for its sexism, my thoughts go out to all angry women’.

After a New York Times reporter’s book recounted disputes inside the White House involving a feisty and impatient First lady, Mrs Obama gave a television interview protesting about being characterised as an ‘angry black woman’.

The two husbands may have got off to a rocky start, as Mr Hollande confirmed that France would withdraw from the U.S.-led war in Afghanistan by the end of the year.

The announcement was apparently no surprise to Mr Obama, who nodded along but did not otherwise respond to the news.

Mr Hollande insisted: 'We will continue to support Afghanistan in a different way. Our support will take a different format.

'I'm pretty sure I will find the right means so that our allies can continue with their mission and at the same time I can comply to the promise I made to the French people.'

The declaration means that means France, one of the top contributors of troops to the war, will be removing the combat forces a full two years before the timeline agreed to by allies in the coalition.

That could shift more of the burden to those allies and give them reason to hasten their own exit.

Hollande later told reporters that some 'residual' number of France's current 3,300 troops will remain in Afghanistan after this year to provide training and to bring home equipment.
