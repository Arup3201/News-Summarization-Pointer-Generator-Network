Shot by police: Officers opened fire on Gordon Samel after he allegedly drove at an officer approaching his vehicle on foot

An Alaskan moose hunter, who discovered 
the body of a wanderer immortalized in the book and film Into the 
Wild, has been shot and killed by police following a chase through the 
city of Wasilla, Alaska State Troopers said.

Police said Gordon E. Samel, 52, who played a small but important role in author Jon Krakauer's book about wanderer Chris McCandless, which was made into a movie by Sean Penn, on Sunday fled police who had approached his vehicle in response to a report about possible drunken driving.

'As the state trooper knocked on the side of the pickup to contact the occupants, it drove off and circled around several small businesses in the area,' an Alaska State Trooper report said.

It said Samel then led law-enforcement 
officers on a high-speed chase along the city's main thoroughfare, 
briefly against traffic, and at times into lightly populated residential
 areas before he was ultimately blocked at an intersection.When
 a state trooper and a Wasilla police officer approached the truck on 
foot, Samel backed up the truck toward the officer, prompting both the 
officer and trooper to fire their handguns, the report said. Samel was 
declared dead at the scene.

Samel's
 mother Roberta Lincoln told the Anchorage Daily News that she couldn't 
understand why the officers didn't use a Tazer or shoot out the car's 
tires instead of shooting him dead.

'I'm sure he was probably trying to get away but not run over somebody,' she said. 'He would never do that.'

Immortalized: The story of Christopher McCandless (right) whose body was discovered by Gordon Samel, was made into a film starring Emile Hirsch

A passenger received a non-life threatening injury to one of his arms, and was released without being charged.

Samel
 was among a party of moose hunters who discovered McCandless's corpse 
in an abandoned bus in a remote part of the Alaska wilderness north of 
Mount McKinley two decades ago.

Krakauer,
 in writing about McCandless's death, looked to Samel for insights into 
the young man's behavior, including his agonizing over killing what he 
thought was a moose.

It was not a moose but a caribou, Krakauer learned from Samel, according to his book Into the Wild.

'There's
 a big difference between a moose and a caribou,' Samel was quoted as 
saying in the book. 'A real big difference. You'd have to be pretty 
stupid not to be able to tell them apart.'

Samel's family told the Anchorage Daily News that he was a gifted mechanic and auto body repairman, and a 'big-hearted outdoorsman who struggled with bipolar disorder.'

He had two adult children, a son and a daughter, and, when he was taking his bipolar medication, said his brother Steve Samel, 'he was a real asset to the family.'

Samel's criminal history dates back to 1983, and at the time of his death he was under court-ordered restrictions from a September DUI arrest.

According to the Anchorage Daily News, a report forwarded from the Alaska Bureau of Investigation to the state's Office of Special Prosecutions will be used to determine whether the use of deadly force on Samel was justified.Â
