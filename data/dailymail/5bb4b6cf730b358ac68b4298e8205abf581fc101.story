A teen in California who managed to survive two deadly plane crashes that took the lives of his entire family spoke publicly Wednesday for the first time since his impossibly tragic tale became national news in 2011.

Former high school basketball star Austin Hatch spent the past two years re-learning how to breathe, eat, walk and live after surviving a plane crash that killed his father and stepmother in Charlevoix, Michigan that year. A 2003 crash had already killed Austin’s mother, brother, and sister.

Despite the emotional torture that has marked most of his childhood, Hatch maintained a remarkably upbeat attitude and announced two years after he was originally offered a spot on the team that he would indeed be fulfilling his dream of joining the University of Michigan’s basketball team.

Speaking out: For the first time since he experience his short life's second deadly plane crash, Austin Hatch spoke publicly about losing his entire family one tragedy at a time

Although Hatch knows he'll never be the same person or the same basketball player after living through the second crash of his young life, he's pursuing his recovery with a scholarship to the university.

‘It has been a goal of mine since I can remember,’ Hatch said at a Los Angeles media event Wednesday. 'It was kind of surreal to actually sign.'

Hatch is now living with an uncle in California and attending a Pasadena high school after deciding to leave his home town of Fort Wayne, Indiana as part of his recovery.

Bitter fate: Just 10 days before the 2011 plane crash that killed Hatch's last remaining parent and left his with a serious brain injury, the standout high school basketball star had been offered a spot on the University of Michigan basketball team

'On scholarship no matter what': Hatch spoke at a Wednesday news conference in part to announce that after years of arduous recovery, he would finally be joining the Michigan basketball team, though it what capacity remained unclear

Backup: Hatch, who now lives with his uncle Michael (left) hasn't played a competitive game since his crash and will likely play a backup role as a Wolverine when he joins the team next year. At right is his Pasadena high school coach Jamal Adams

'Basketball has always given me something to shoot for': Throughout his 10 month recovery from serious brain trauma and other injuries, Hatch remained intent on playing college basketball

‘I was dealing with the loss of my best friend, my coach, my teacher, my mentor and my No. 1 fan -- that same man was also my father, Dr. Stephen Hatch,’ he told reporters.

Austin’s father had remarried and was adamant that he stick with his passion for flying despite the earlier trauma of losing most of his family.

June 24, 2011, Austin, his father, his stepmother, and the family dog Brady smashed into a garage of the Charlevoix, Michigan airport. Only Austin and Brady made it out alive.

Just 10 days before the crash, Austin—then the standout star of Canterbury High School’s team—had made agreed to play for the University of Michigan upon his graduation.

During his arduous 10 month recovery from a brain trauma and other injuries, Austin kept his focus on his dream of playing college basketball.

‘Basketball has always given me something to shoot for,’ he said Wednesday.

Despite all odds, Austin’s dream will come true. Michigan coach John Beilein named Austin last week as part of the 2014 recruiting class and he will attend on a scholarship.

It is unclear in what capacity Austin—who hasn’t played basketball even once outside of practices since the crash—will play on the team. But he’s still determined to play a role.

‘[Beilein] told me that he wouldn't offer me a scholarship if he didn't think I had a role on the team that would help them win,’ Austin said. ‘He said, 'Austin, whatever you are able to do, whether it be a manager or a practice player or whatever, you're on scholarship no matter what.’

In addition to his sports-related announcement, Austin touched on his life’s tragedies at the news conference.

‘Aside from the physical trauma that I suffered in the accident,’ he said. ‘The emotional pain will never fully subside.’

Lighting strikes again: Austin's physician father Michael was at the helm of this single engine plane when it crashed into a garage, killing him and his wife and sparing only 17-year-old Austin

Unthinkable: The wreckage of Dr Hatch's plane after it crashed into a garage in Charlevoix, Michigan on June 24, 2011. Just a few years before, a similar crash left Austin's mother, brother, and sister dead

Terrible twist: Dr Stephen Hatch died in a plane crash in 2011 - eight years after he survived a deadly smash that killed his wife and two children

Earlier crash: Austin and his father survived 
another crash in 2003 that killed the boy’s mother, Julie, left, and his
two siblings, Lindsay, 11, centre and Ian, 5, right

Austin, who was eight years old at the time, only survived the 2003 crash when his father flung him out of the burning plane.

Austin was given a small measure of 
comfort after the crash when his dog, a labradoodle named Brady, was found 
wandering near the crash site in the days following the accident.

Dead in the crash were Austin’s 38-year-old mother Julie, his 11-year-old sister Lindsay and 5-year-old brother Ian.

Best friends: Austin Patch and his labradoodle Brady were the only survivors of the horrific plane crash in 2011 that killed his doctor father and stepmother

Clinging to what's left: Here Austin poses with his uncle Michael Hatch, one of his few remaining living relatives. Austin moved to Pasadena from Indiana following the 2011 crash in order to facilitate his healing

In a terrible twist of fate, the family was returning from their summer home on Walloon Lake when they crashed in 2003.

This
was the same place they were flying when their single-engine plane flew
into a garage near the Charlevoix Municipal Airport.

Pilot error was named as the cause of the 2011 crash.

As he awaits the fall semester at Michigan, Austin hopes to play for Loyola High School at some point this winter.

‘I feel like God has his hand on me,’ he said. ‘I feel like there's a plan for my life.’

'The Way I Cope With My Loss Is Going To Change': In addition to his basketball news, Austin discussed what he's been through emotionally since the crash that took away what was left of his family

Hopeful: Here, Austin greets his basketball trainer Rasheed Hazzard, a specialist in getting players back on the court following injury, who he hopes will facilitate his return to the sport
