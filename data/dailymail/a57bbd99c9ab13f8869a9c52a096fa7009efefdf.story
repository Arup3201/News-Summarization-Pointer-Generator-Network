Business success: Nicky Blair, the football agent son of Tony Blair, is understood to have secured a record fee for a Mexican star this summer

He has some way to go before  he matches his father’s multi- million-pound fortune. But Nicky Blair certainly seems to be heading in the right direction.

After setting himself up as a football agent, Tony Blair’s middle son has reportedly struck his first big deal – collecting 10 per cent from a £6.7million transfer.

Nicky, 27, apparently helped negotiate the big-money move of Mexican Hector Herrera to top European side FC Porto in June.

But that record transfer for a Mexican player may be dwarfed if his compatriot Marco Fabian, who is also represented by Nicky, is snapped up by Premier League or European clubs next year for a reputed £10million.

Nicky was once thought to want to follow his father into politics.

But unlike older brother Euan, 29, who is tipped to stand for Parliament, Nicky left Oxford, where he studied modern history, and taught at an inner-city school in the West Midlands for two years.

He and his university friend Gabriel Moraes then launched themselves into the lucrative field of football agencies.

Last year he was sharing a desk in his mother Cherie’s London law practice but his Magnitude agency has reportedly become so successful that it now has offices in Rio de Janeiro and Mexico City.

His success makes him a chip off the old block. Tony Blair makes millions of pounds a year advising governments and international firms, and is said to be worth £60million to £80million.

He is notoriously secretive about his wealth, with most of his earnings since he left office in 2007 hidden in a network of private firms.

However he is believed to have paid for the a four-storey, £1.35million Georgian townhouse in central London where Nicky lives.

Nicky's mother was a director of  Magnitude Limited until May, owning 20 per cent, and allows her son to use a desk at her business in central London.

EUAN BLAIR: Euan is the eldest Blair child and is the only one with obvious political ambitions.

The Labour seat of Coventry North West could become vacant as current MP Geoffrey Robinson may retire in 2015, and the 29-year-old is thought to be keen.

He is currently chief commercial officer for recruitment agency Sarina Russo Job Access.

Last month he married his long-term girlfriend Suzanne Ashman, 25, in Wotton Underwood, Buckinghamshire.

KATHRYN BLAIR: 25-year-old Kathryn was called to the Bar last year by Lincoln’s Inn – the same inn of court her parents Tony and Cherie joined in the 1970s.

The young barrister has a boyfriend and lives in £975,000 home her father bought her in 2010, near his own central London property.

LEO BLAIR: 13-year-old Leo is the youngest child, and known to be musically-gifted, currently appearing in the English National Opera's production of The Magic Flute

The schoolboy is playing 'Spirit', and made his West End debut in the chorus of Bizet’s Carmen last year.

In 2000 he was the first child born to a serving Prime Minister for 150 years, and was named after Tony Blair's late father.

Mrs Blair had even taken major steps to help Nicky secure top players in the Americas.

In 2011 she took time out of her busy international schedule to meet an unknown Mexican footballer.

A car collected then 17-year-old soccer prodigy Raul Mendiola from his family’s rundown trailer-park home in a Spanish-speaking suburb of Los Angeles and took him to the plush hotel where the wife of the ex-Prime Minister was staying.

She spent time chatting to the footballer before posing for a photograph with him.

Just days later, in an apparent attempt to cement confidence in her son’s business, Raul’s mother Claudia Velador received a picture of a smartly dressed Mr and Mrs Blair, personally signed with the words ‘Thank you’.

But it emerged that Raul had no idea he had entrusted his future to a man whose parents are on first-name terms with the world’s most powerful people.

Speaking from her home in San Bernardino, California, Claudia said: ‘Raul didn’t have a clue he was dealing with a former Prime Minister’s son'. He now plays for David Beckham's former side LA Galaxy.

Nicky gave up being a school teacher to set up the company with Oxford University friend Gabriel Moraes.

However, it emerged earlier this year that the business was loss-making and was to be dissolved and restructured.

But the Herrera transfer may have made
 all the difference to the company and Nicky is now said to be looking 
to expand into the Middle East.
