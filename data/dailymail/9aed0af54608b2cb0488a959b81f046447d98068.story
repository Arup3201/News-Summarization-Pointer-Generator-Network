More than half of Premier League clubs have hiked season-ticket prices — despite cashing in on the latest TV deal worth £5.5billion over three years.

The Football Supporters’ Federation (FSF) are planning a march in protest and their chairman Malcolm Clarke said: ‘Nine out of 10 fans already think they are paying too much for tickets and these figures only back that point of view.

‘Clubs are swimming in cash and the last media deal was worth £5bn. The huge increase would have been enough for clubs to let every fan in for free and they would have been no worse off.

Hike: Premier League fans are set to face price rises yet again

‘Top-flight clubs need to think long-term and cut prices. Never mind all the clever PR strategies clubs come out with, nothing would earn goodwill like dropping prices.

‘The FSF will lead a march on Premier League and Football League HQ on August 14. We would encourage all fans to join us.’

With clubs out to maximise revenues to be able to compete in the Premier League within the constraints of Financial Fair Play, fans are once again paying increased prices and 13 sides have raised season-ticket prices this season.

The biggest price hikes have been made by Burnley and QPR, both promoted last season — Burnley have raised the price of their cheapest season ticket prices by a whopping 47 per cent. Substantial rises have also been announced at Stoke and Hull.

Burnley chief executive Lee Hoos has defended the increases by pointing out that fans able to watch Premier League football this season and because £100 from this year’s season-ticket price will go towards the 2015/16 season tickets when fans renew.

Victors: Despite winning the Premier League, Manchester City have frozen some ticket prices

With the Premier League acknowledged as the most lucrative in the world, only two clubs have lowered prices this season.

Football for some fans in the North East has come down in price after Mike Ashley announced marginal price cuts at Newcastle and Sunderland kept their prices down, too.

Arsenal have instigated three per cent price rises in line with inflation, taking their most expensive season-ticket prices above the £2,000 mark, the highest in the league.

Arsenal also have the most expensive low-cost season ticket, priced at £1,014, which, with the exception of Tottenham and Chelsea, is more costly than every other clubs’ most expensive ticket.

Despite winning the league last term, Manchester City have frozen the cost of their cheapest season tickets at £299 — the cheapest in the Premier League — although the club have announced a 10 per cent rise on the most expensive season tickets at the Etihad to £860.
