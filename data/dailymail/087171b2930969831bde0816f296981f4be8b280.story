Penelopi sleeps in her own sparkly pink bedroom, has a wardrobe full of clothes and is proudly pushed around the shops in her buggy every day.

It sounds like the typical life of a little girl - except Penelopi isn't a toddler, she's a pig.

Her owner Mindi Reinbolt, 37, from Uniontown, Ohio, lavishes her with outfits and luxury gifts. And the 14-month-old porker will accompanying Mindi wherever she goes.

Little princess: Mindi loves to spoil her pet pig Penelopi

Extensive wardrobe: The pig has a different outfit for every day

Not a pigsty: Penelopi even has her own bedroom, decorated in pink and filled with toys and clothes

While out shopping Mindi pushes Penelopi around in a child buggy - and when they stop for a drink only Starbucks will satisfy the pig's expensive taste.

Despite having four trotters, Mindi believes her pig deserves to be treated like a human and loves the attention she gets.

Mindi, a manager of a medical oncology physicians practice, said: 'I treat her like luxury because she acts just like a little girl.

'She is very human like and has the intelligence of a three-to-four-year old little girl. She loves to go out and about and just loves all the attention from everyone.

Unusual family: Mindi and her husband, Brett, also have a pet dog - but he walks instead of using the buggy like Penelopi the pig

Company: Mindi takes her pet everywhere with her in her stroller

Sweet tooth: The pig loves to be treated to ice lollies and is partial to a frappuccino from Starbucks

'She is my little princess and I love her.'

Mindi adopted Penelopi, a mix between a Juliana and a Mini Pig, when she was 10 months old from Ledge Life Farms. The pig instantly settled in and became best friends with her new brother Bailey, a schnoodle dog.

With the help of her husband Brett, Mindi adapted their home so Penelopi could have her own luxurious space. They transformed an upstairs room into Penelopi's very own pink bedroom complete with a fireplace, a full sized wardrobe, a play pen and lots of piggy accessories.

Mindi said: 'Her bedroom is gorgeous and very pink - it is fit for a princess! She has her own dresser for all of her clothes.

Indulged: Penelopi poses with just some of her clothes in her bedroom

Pampering: Penelopi enjoys a good bubble bath and has an outfit for every occasion

'She deserves it': Mindi says her pig acts just like a little girl

'Every morning she gets a new outfit on and she has hundreds of matching bows and hats that she wears with each of them.'

Mindi likes to show off her adorable pig as much as possible, and once dressed, takes her out on the town.

She said: 'She is used to getting all glammed up and going out and meeting people. She just loves all the attention from everyone. She loves being in the spotlight and everyone loves her.

'Whenever we go out I push her in her very own stroller. She is trained to walk on a leash but its not really ideal because people swarm around her, she's safest in her buggy and she loves it.'

Glammed up: The pig has her trotters painted with glittery nail varnish after getting clean in the bath

Centre of attention: Mindi said Penelopi always draws a crowd when she takes her out for walks in the stroller

Star: The pig even has her own Facebook and Instagram accounts

Mindi added: 'She loves to go shopping with me. She is mummy's little shopping buddy and even goes in the dressing room with me.

'She loves Starbucks and often drinks some of my frappuccino when we're out. She also loves to go get ice cream and she even knows how to eat off of a fork and spoon.'

With a new outfit every day, it's not a surprise that Mindi has forked out thousands on the miniature pig. 

'She is a little diva fashionista and she deserves it all,' her proud owner said

The pig even has her own Facebook page 'Penelopi the Pig Reinbolt' with 700 dedicated followers and over 600 followers on her 'Penelopipig' Instagram keeping up to date with her adventures.
