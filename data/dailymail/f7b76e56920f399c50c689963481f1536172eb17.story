Concern: Coronation Street character Hayley Cropper (played by Julie Hesmondhalgh, pictured) will commit suicide in Monday's episode

Campaigners have criticised plans to show a Coronation Street character killing herself before the watershed, warning it could lead to copycat suicides among young viewers.

The ITV soap sparked debate with the revelation that its much-loved character Hayley Cropper will commit suicide in Monday’s episode rather than continue her losing battle with pancreatic cancer.

She is played by Julie Hesmondhalgh, a member of the British Humanist Association who has ‘strong views’ in favour of assisted dying.

But the 43-year-old – who has played the transsexual wife of café owner Roy for 15 years – has now been branded insensitive for discussing the plot in a series of recent interviews to highlight her belief that euthanasia should be legalised.

Miss Hesmondhalgh’s final scenes in the soap – which air at 7.30pm – will show her drinking a cocktail of drugs before dying in bed in the arms of her husband.

She mixes the lethal drink herself and tells him not to touch the glass, to avoid implicating him in her death. Mr Cropper disagrees with her decision and is left filled with feelings of guilt and anger.

Last night, anti-euthanasia group Care Not Killing said it was ‘irresponsible’ to schedule the storyline before the 9pm watershed when it would be seen by ‘young and impressionable viewers’.

And Mediawatch UK director Vivienne Pattison said she feared the episode could lead to ‘copycat’ suicides. ‘Putting it before a 9pm watershed, we can assume fairly safely that there are going to be children watching it,’ she added.

‘They do not consume media in the same critical way adults do and are far more likely to take on as gospel truth what they’ve seen.’

The storyline has also reopened the national debate on euthanasia ahead of a House of Lords hearing on the issue in May.

Labour peer Lord Falconer, who has tabled an Assisted Dying Bill,  called for Parliament to ‘resolve the mess’ of current legislation that makes it a crime to help the terminally ill to kill themselves.

Assisted suicide is legal in Switzerland, the Netherlands and some US states.

Since the Dignitas assisted dying centre opened in Switzerland in 1998, more than 180 terminally ill British people have travelled there to end their suffering on their own terms.

Ex-soldier Reg Crew, who had motor neurone disease, became the first Briton to publicly go to Dignitas and commit suicide in 2003.

His wife, Win, was threatened with legal action when she got home but was not charged.

Yesterday, Mediawatch UK’s Miss Pattison also attacked Miss Hesmondhalgh for using her role in the storyline to generate publicity for views that she endorses.

She said: ‘She’s perfectly entitled to her opinion as a public citizen. But to [campaign] on the back of this I think is not a good thing. I think it’s very insensitive to do it on the back of this storyline. It’s a very emotive issue and linking it to something like Corrie which is much loved is not appropriate.’

Anthony Ozimic, from anti-euthanasia group SPUC Pro-Life, said: ‘We fear that Monday’s storyline will fail to give a medically-accurate depiction of the reality of palliative care in Britain today.’

But the plot was backed by the chief executive of pro-euthanasia group Dignity in Dying, Sarah Wootton, who said it had been approached in a ‘sensitive way’.

She added: ‘TV dramas, although fictional, often reflect very real issues. We know a small, but significant, number of terminally ill people want control over the manner and timing of their death.’

A ITV spokesman defended its decision to screen Monday’s episode before the watershed, saying: ‘This storyline has been well signposted and viewers will be fully aware of the drama as it unfolds.’

He added: ‘The Coronation Street writing team independently arrived at the decision to conclude Hayley’s story in this way. This was in no way influenced by Julie or her personal beliefs.’
