With their rich and vibrant colours and bold landscapes, these dramatic artworks would not look out of place on sale in any top gallery.

But what makes them even more extraordinary is that the artist began painting as a toddler, had his first exhibition at five and has now earned his first paid commission at 11.

Prodigy Matthew Johnson is the fourth generation of painter in his family and learned to hold a brush before he could use a pen.

The schoolboy, from Spennymoor, County Durham, is now being paid by a collector to create a new unique piece for their home.

Star in the making: 11-year-old Matthew Johnson has picked up his first paid commission after his work was seen by collectors

'It feels amazing. In one sense it's just like doing another painting but I realise it's a commission because someone really likes my work and trust me to magic up another,' he said.

The youngster concentrates on creating abstract landscapes, which he textures using a layering technique.

He takes his inspiration from a rich artistic background, but also through his love for video games.

'I love to capture the rich skies and landscapes you see in video games,' he said. 'You can really make paintings come to life using deep colours to sense the mood and tone of each setting.'

Magical: Matthew enjoys painting landscapes, especially in his native north-east, shown here in his piece 'Great day for sailing'

Moody: This abstract painting, called 'Elemental', is a good example of his work as it shows his love of colour and texture

Talented:  Matthew's work, like 'Twilight Highlands', left, and 'Sun Dance', right, has led to interest from collectors

Matthew is the same age as Kieron Williamson, known as the ‘Mini Monet’, who has gained international renown and earned £1.5million since he began painting landscapes on a family holiday five years ago.

Matthew's mother Lynn Rocks, his grandfather Colin Richardson and his older twin brothers, Chris and Steve Rocks, are all professional artists.

Proud:  Matthew's mother Lynn Rocks says he and all the family are 'chuffed' about his early success

Ms Rocks, 52, said: 'Matthew and his brothers were always painting. We are an arty family so all of the materials were at hand for him to use.

'He would always take his top off while painting, which became a bit of a routine whether he was in our studio or outside. We were worried he would go to school and do the same!

'He's a very talented individual and he amazes me at how vast his imagination is. He gets worried that he's not good at Maths, but he is so creative, and I have no doubt that's what his future holds for him.'

Matthew was hired to take on his latest challenge by a couple who want him to create a painting for the living room of their newly renovated family home.

The piece will form the focal piece of the room, and will no doubt attract great interest from those who see it.

The 11-year-old said: 'For them to put such confidence in me for something that will be such a big part of their home feels really special.

'My family have been such role models, and I'm really pleased to be learning fro them.

'When I was about seven, I saw my mam counting out loads of money after selling a painting and I thought, that job sounds good to me.

'I don't know yet if I will do this as a career, but it would be great to do something I enjoy.'

A millionaire: 'Mini Monet' Kieron Williamson, 11, has seen his lifetime earnings approach £1.5million

Advanced: Kieron is considered to be well beyond his years in his level of talent and has stunned art lovers the world over

Multi-talented Matthew doesn't just stop at painting - he also plays the ukulele, break dances, performs card tricks and acts.

His mother added: 'We are all immensely proud of him and he's so chuffed to be given this opportunity.'
