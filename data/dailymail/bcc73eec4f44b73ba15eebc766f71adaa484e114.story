Pictures of Caitlin Kearney line the walls of her mother's Pitman, New Jersey, home, but Denise Urevick says she hasn't seen her daughter for years. 

The photographs are the only image of mom that Caitlin's own three-year-old daughter, Lily, who lives with Urevick, has since Kearney left her as a newborn in 2012.

Kearney and Lily had been living with Kearney's grandmother until June of that year, when she walked into the home and heard her grandmother on the phone - upset - and speaking about her.

Missing: Caitlin Kearney, recently would have turned 23, hasn't been seen by her family since she walked out of her grandmother's home where she was living in 2012

'Caitlin just turned around and walked out,' Urevick, 57, told the South Jersey Times. 'No one had heard from her that day.'

Her disappearance, coming after what her mother characterized as a losing struggle with drugs, derailed both her family life and Kearney's plans to study nursing.

'When she first left, I had heard there were sightings of her,' Urevick said. 'I knew she was OK. I reported her missing when the information stopped coming in.'

Urevick says she started searching for her daughter in Camden, where her daughter had gotten into trouble with the law and occasionally Urevick heard troubling rumors.

'What is really frightening, was at one point we were told that she could have been held against her will,' Urevick said. 'But we never were able to find out if that was true or not.'

Both Pitman Police Department and the Gloucester County Prosecutor's Office have investigated Kearney's case but all leads pointed to dead ends.

Unreachable: Urevick says Kearney recently had begun having issues with substance abuse that was souring their 'normal' relationship

Detective Bryn Wilden of the Gloucester County Prosecutor's Office said his departmetn was 'unable to substantiate any claim that Caitlin had been held against her will.'

Last week, Pitman police re-released the case, hoping to turn up new information that could lead to Kearney after two and a half years of fruitless searching.

'I'm still holding on to hope that we'll find Caitlin,' Urevick said. 'Of course I constantly think of her and worry about her. But I have to be OK for my granddaughter.'

'If Caitlin should read this, she should know her entire family wants her back home,' she added.
