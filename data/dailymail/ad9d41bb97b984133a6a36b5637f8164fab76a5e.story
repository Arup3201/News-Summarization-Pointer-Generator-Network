With its own private beach and sublimely tranquil surroundings, this Norwegian house is up for sale - for just 5p.

There is a condition however for any prospective buyer - they must focus their efforts into restoring the ramshackle property to its former glory.

The house is located on the  island of Buoya on the fringes of the Arctic circle, and it has been uninhabited since the last tenant moved out in the 1970s.

This Norwegian house is up for sale for just 5p, although admittedly there is a lot of work for the new owner to do

Despite the house needing extensive repairs, the landscape views from the property are unrivalled

It is in the hands of Norwegian Kent Karlsen who said: 'I had hoped to patch it up but it just never happened, and it seems a real shame that such a beautiful property is now falling apart and nobody is getting any benefit from it. 

'I didn't want it to simply be sold to someone else who also neglected it, and as a result put it up for sale for a bargain price provided the new owner convinced me they really intend to put it back in order.

'It will really need somebody with passion and of course the resources because pretty much everything needs doing.'

His advert was placed on Finn.no, Norway's version of eBay, recently and although he has had some interest is waiting until he gets the right offer from the right person.

The current owner describes the house as 'an exciting project, and a 'unique opportunity

He added: 'I don't really think it's worth taking more money anyway, because the house is currently a catastrophe to say the least. But for the right person it is an exciting project and a unique opportunity.'

One of those so far who has expressed interest is an architect who offered to draw up plans agreed a completion date if he is given the property.

'I will make up my mind once I've seen all the candidates and see who gives me the best gut feeling, and will sell it to them,' said Karlsen.
