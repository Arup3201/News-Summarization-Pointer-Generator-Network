Twitter has finally laid itself bare in an 800-page filing released late Thursday as it prepares for an eagerly anticipated IPO.

The documents reveal that Twitter is planning to raise $1 billion for its upcoming IPO. With its initial valuation expected to be more than $10 billion, those with a large stake in the company are expected to get a huge payday when it goes public.

But the major stakeholders identified in the documents exclude one key player - Twitter co-founder Biz Stone. Stone, who founded the company with CEO Jack Dorsey and Evan Williams, isn't listed in the documents, meaning he doesn't own enough stock to trigger legal disclosures.

That suggests he likely unloaded at least a portion of his stake when he left the company in 2011.

Jack Dorsey founded Twitter in 2006 when he was 29 years old. He now serves as chairman

As for Dorsey and Williams, the IPO will make them billionaires.

Williams, Twitter's former CEO, owns a 12 percent stake in the company. 
If Twitter turns out to be worth at least $17.60 per share in the IPO, 
Williams will be a billionaire at 41 years old. He remains on Twitter's 
board of directors.

Another board member, Peter Fenton, and his venture capital firm, Benchmark Capital, own a 6.7 percent stake.

Next
in line with a 4.9 percent stake is Jack Dorsey, who came up for the 
idea for Twitter with Stone and Noah Glass. Glass's shares aren't listed
in the documents.

Many
of Twitter's 2,000 employees could become rich, too, if the company's 
stock fares well. They won't be allowed to sell their stock until Feb. 
15, at the earliest.

Through the first half of this year, Twitter's revenue totaled $254 million, more than doubling from last year. If Twitter maintains that growth pace through the second half, the company's revenue will surpass $656 million this year. All told, Twitter generated $317 million in revenue in 2012.

Twitter gets 87 percent of its revenue from advertising. The rest comes from licensing agreements that give other companies better access to the flow of tweeting activity on its service.

Meanwhile, Twitter ended June with 218 million users, up from 30 million in early 2010. More than three-quarters of those users, or 169 million people, are located outside the U.S. Twitter's fastest growing markets are in Argentina, France, Japan, Russia, Saudi Arabia and South Africa.

Bust the company isn't profitable.

It takes more than cultural heft to build a business of substance, as Twitter is learning. The company has suffered uninterrupted losses of $419 million since its inception. That's something Twitter has been able to afford because it has raised $759 million from investors. The company still had $375 million in the bank at the end of June and hopes to raise at least $1 billion more in its IPO.

But shareholders of publicly held companies don't tolerate losses for very long, and it could still be a while before Twitter turns a profit.

Twitter's losses widened during the first half of this year to $69 million, up from $49 million in the same period last year. In contrast, both social networking leader Facebook Inc. and professional networking leader LinkedIn Corp. were profitable when they went public.

To make money, Twitter will likely get more aggressive about showing ads.

In the three months ending in June, Twitter generated revenue of $139 million, or an average of just 64 cents per user. In contrast, Facebook generated second-quarter revenue of nearly $1.2 billion, or an average of $1.58 per user, while LinkedIn posted revenue of $364 million, or an average of $1.53 per user.

Growth by numbers: The company has only been in existence for seven years but has clearly made a dent

As Twitter cranks up its marketing 
machine, it runs the risk of alienating an audience accustomed to seeing
relatively few ads in their news feeds. Beyond the U.S., Twitter is 
gearing to expand its advertising efforts in Australia, Brazil, Canada, 
Japan and the United Kingdom.

The first tangible sign of Twitter's 
desire to go public came in the middle of last month when they tweeted 
that they submitted their flotation application to the SEC.

Twitter did not say which stock exchange it plans to list its shares on.

The influx of cash into the company will mean the beginning of serious expansion, as Bloomberg
reports that they are planning to lease a 320,000-square-foot office 
space directly next to their current headquarters in San Francisco.

The move to go public is one of the most highly 
anticipated IPOs in tech history with Twitter the last of the major 
social networking sites to go public.

It comes after Facebook floated on 
the US stock market in May 2012 for $104 billion (Â£66.2 billion) and, 
despite seeing an initial slump in shares, has since had a resurgence.

It
is thought that like Facebook, Twitter bosses' hands were forced by the
Jobs Act which requires a U.S firm to file an IPO once it has reached 
2,000 investors.

The company has been ramping up its advertising products and working to boost ad revenue in preparation for the IPO.

But it is still small in comparison to Facebook, which saw its highly anticipated IPO implode last year amid worries about its ability to grow mobile ad revenue.

Twitter site was founded in March 2006 and has become one of the world's most popular social networking sites over the past seven years.

Jack Dorsey's interest in programming 
began at the ripe age of eight, according to a 2011 Vanity Fair article. He 
came up with the idea for Twitter in his 20s and shared it with Biz 
Stone and Evan Williams, two of his bosses at San Francisco software 
start-up Odeo.

Williams embraced the idea and made Dorsey, who was 29 at the time, the founding CEO of the new company.

Stone, 39, and Williams, 41, have also helped create Blogger, Medium, and a host of other Internet ventures.

Dorsey is currently thought to be worth around $1.1billion.
Stone's wealth is estimated to be worth $200million while Evan 
Williams, thought to be the richest of the three, is worth about $2billion.

Faring better: Twitter will surely try to learn from the mistakes of Facebook, as the social media giant's stock price took a massive and prolonged hit after a much-hyped IPO in 2012 though just recently it bounced back

Twitter was created back in March 2006 but its popularity soon went through the roof with more than 500 million users registered worldwide as of last year and more than 500 million tweets sent a day. Here is a list of interesting facts about what makes Twitter a global phenomenon:
