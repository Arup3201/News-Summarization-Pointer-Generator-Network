A woman stripped of her Miss Delaware title last month for being too old is suing state pageant officials and the Miss America organization.

In a lawsuit filed Tuesday, Amanda Longacre is seeking to be reinstated as Miss Delaware and to be allowed to compete in the Miss America pageant. 

She also is seeking $500,000 in damages for herself and $2.5 million for other contestants who she claims were recruited to compete in pageants before being told they were too old.

Lawsuit: Amanda Longacre is seeking to be reinstated as Miss Delaware and to be allowed to compete in the Miss America pageant

Longacre is also seeking $500,000 in damages for herself and $2.5million for other contestants who she claims were recruited to compete in pageants before being told they were too old

Officials say Miss America pageant rules require contestants to be between 17 and 24. Longacre turns 25 on October 22, after this year's national pageant.

The lawsuit alleges that one or more other contestants in the 2014 Miss Delaware pageant also were too old to compete under those rules.

'It is a lawsuit without merit and we will defend it vigorously,' said Sharon Pearce, president of the Miss America organization.

State pageant representatives did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment Wednesday.

The Miss Delaware crown was given to runner-up Brittany Lewis.

In June, Ms Longacre told Today: 'I won the title of Miss Delaware, I am Miss Delaware. I have been nothing but honest from the beginning. I did not know that rule. I asked from the beginning if I was eligible and they said yes, they signed off on my contract, they had my birth certificate, I gave them everything.'

Miss Longacre sobbed on camera saying she was devastated at losing the chance to represent the people of Delaware

The 24-year-old wept on camera last week as she described the heartache of losing her coveted title. However she is allowed to keep a $9,000 scholarship award which was part of her winnings.

The Penn State graduate said on Monday: 'I've gotten a lot of support and I'm so appreciative of it. I feel so much love from my state, and even from outside of my state people have been supporting me.

'I've been nothing but honest since the beginning and they don't think it's right either.'

She added: 'This is about the title of Miss Delaware that I rightfully won. I want to represent the people of Delaware. I want to be a social worker. This was a great start to a fabulous career for me and it's still going to be a fabulous career for me.'

She said that although the age rule is in her contract, she assumed she was eligible because the Miss Delaware organization signed off.

'I didn't know the rule, I also competed at the local level and it's been several months. You put your trust in an organization to know their own rules. So when you come forward and you're honest and you put the time and money in, this is not fair.'

In a statement to MailOnline, the Miss Delaware Scholarship Organization said: 'Following the Miss Delaware Pageant, it was determined that Amanda Longacre exceeded the age requirement in order to be eligible to compete therefore, the Miss Delaware 2014 title is awarded to Brittany Lewis.

'The Miss Delaware Pageant is proud to congratulate Brittany and wishes Amanda the very best on her future endeavors.'
