Next year’s World Cup may mark the end of Dylan Hartley’s England career after unconfirmed reports in France suggested that the hooker is poised to join Montpellier next season.

The 28-year-old is the most-capped player in the national squad at present, having made 58 Test appearances since his debut against the Pacific Islanders at Twickenham six years ago. 

He has been Northampton captain since 2009 and during that period the Saints have won the Aviva Premiership title, finished as runners-up, reached a Heineken Cup Final and won both the Amlin Challenge Cup and LV Cup.

Hartley’s career has been punctuated by disciplinary issues, but his club have supported him, not least when he incurred an 11-week ban which ruled him out of last year’s Lions tour after being sent off and found guilty of swearing at referee Wayne Barnes in the 2013 Premiership Final. 

In return, he has been an inspirational talisman for Northampton and a cult hero at Franklin’s Gardens.

However, his contract is up at the end of this season and reports across the Channel claim Hartley has visited Montpellier to view the facilities and will join the club on a three-year deal after the World Cup. There has been no official confirmation from Montpellier or Hartley’s advisers, but if he does make that overseas move, it will bring an end to his Test career.

The RFU and England management are continuing to enforce a policy of not selecting players based abroad and just last week, national coach Stuart Lancaster reiterated his commitment to that stance – aimed at stopping an exodus of English talent to wealthy French clubs. 

Hartley would be 33 by the time of the 2019 World Cup, so he may have concluded that next year’s home tournament would be a fitting finale at international level.

For Northampton, the loss of their skipper would be a major blow as they seek to consolidate their status as English champions and European challengers. Hartley may not be the only Saint on his way out at the end of the season. 

Further French reports claim that American No 8 Samu Manoa has agreed to join Toulon, while Samoan centre George Pisi has been linked with a move to Castres.

For England, it would be a significant setback to no longer have the services of a pack stalwart, especially as the stocks of Test-class options at hooker are not vast. Tom Youngs of Leicester has been stalked by injuries since making his breakthrough into the national ranks, as has Bath’s Rob Webber.

London Irish No 2 David Paice is the next man in line at present, while Harlequins’ Joe Gray was in the squad for the summer tour of New Zealand. 

But looking ahead to the post-World Cup period, Luke Cowan-Dickie of Exeter is seen as the rising force in that position. If Lancaster is to lose Hartley soon, he will hope to see the rookie Chief making strong strides towards international honours.
