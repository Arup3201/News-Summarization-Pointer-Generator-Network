If you're looking for a bargain break, you should head to Bulgaria, but avoid Italy, according to the latest research.

A basket of 10 typical holiday spending items, including evening meals and drinks, cost just £43 in Sunny Beach in Bulgaria, according to a Post Office travel money survey. But buy the same items in Tuscany or Sorrento and you'll end up spending more than £100.

However, the picture across Europe is positive overall, with price drops of up to 21 per cent in two-thirds of resorts on the Continent.

Balmy Bulgaria: Sunny Beach offers the best value for money for British travellers

Italian idyll: Sorrento is a favourite destination among the rich and famous, but it is pricey

If Bulgaria isn't your cup of tea, then Marmaris, in Turkey, was found to be the second most inexpensive destination, with the items setting holidaymakers back just £54.

Spain's Costa del Sol and Costa Blanca areas were also good value for money, as was the Portuguese Algarve and Paphos in Cyprus where prices have plunged 21 per cent in the last 12 months.

While Italy came out as the most expensive destination, the Balearic party island of Ibiza wasn't far behind, where the basket of items was £97, with travellers to Nice in France also having to splash out, parting with £96.

The basket of items included small items such as a bottle of water, a cup of coffee and suncream, along with lunch for two and a three-course evening meal.

Bargain breaks: The five cheapest destinations to visit, according to the Post Office Travel Money survey

Budget busting: The five priciest destinations included Italy, France, Ibiza and Turkey

While the 
top 10 cheapest places for holidaymakers was dominated by European 
destinations, Orlando, Florida, also made it into ninth place, proving 
the family favourite offers good value for money.

Strangely,
 while Marmaris was the second cheapest destination, the Turkish city of
 Bodrum was listed in the five priciest holiday hotspots, proving that 
there can be a huge difference in costs within the same country.

Andrew Brown, of Post Office Travel Money, said: 'The strength of sterling is great news for people planning holidays abroad and they can make sure their holiday cash stretches even further by doing their homework before booking to pick a destination where prices have fallen furthest.

'Resort prices can make or break the holiday budget so choose a destination where healthy competition between restaurants and bars has resulted in cheaper meals and drinks.'

The holiday costs survey was released as new research found that Britons are planning to travel more this year thanks to growing confidence in the economy.

The latest Holiday Confidence Index, produced by First Rate Exchange Services, YouGov, Institute of Travel & Tourism and the University of Wolverhampton,  found that 57 per cent of adults intend to holiday abroad in the next year – up from 54 per cent six months ago.

And just over half (51 per cent) have already booked their first trip. 

Nearly a third of them (30 per cent) have also booked their second holiday, most commonly for travel in September.

Almost two-thirds of those planning trips rate overseas holidays as important in their lives  – and nearly half say that poor UK weather is a key factor in their decision-making.
