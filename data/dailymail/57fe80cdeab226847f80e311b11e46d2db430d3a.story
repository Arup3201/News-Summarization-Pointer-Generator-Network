LAST month, under the glare of multiple flashbulbs, the world was told: 'Girl Power is back.'

With forced smiles and uncomfortable hugs, five women were shuffled into position by their pushy PR teams and ordered to ooze the youthful happiness and energy that once made them the biggest girl band in the world.

Become the legend: The game follows Lara Croft as she transforms into a hunter

But the eyes never lie, and it was clear for most to see that the once iconic faces didn’t Wannabe there. They just didn’t want to zig-a-zig-a anymore.

(One in particular made that abundantly clear with a trademark pout.)

It seemed that Girl Power had run out and was in desperate need of the Duracell Bunny.

Sixteen years ago, when Mel C, Mel B, Ginger, Sporty, Scary and whatsherface, had pretty much taken over the planet - another icon was born.

Softly spoken, athletic and smart, she was touring the globe herself - unearthing ancient treasures in Cairo, killing crocodiles in the Tomb of Tihocan and squeezing off rounds from her Desert Eagle handgun like Sarah Palin hooked up to a Red Bull drip.

She took Girl Power up a few notches. In fact, she made it a force to be reckoned with.

Her name? Lara Croft.

Not LC, not Crofty Spice...and any suggestions of Spicing Up Her Life would be met with a firm uppercut followed by a devastating roundhouse.

And just like The Spice Girls, Lara is due to make a highly-anticipated comeback.

So, is her makeover a canny, well-crafted upgrade or a tired attempt to re-tie frayed puppet strings and dust off old dance routines?

Smoking hot: Lara's had a makeover and looks great

Well, unlike the characters in Spice World, the heroine of Tomb Raider has grown in strength, agility and beauty.

I was invited to a hands-on with the new game, which isn’t out until next year, yet it was still a tantalising look at what fans can expect from the return of Lara Croft.

Set as a prequel to the original games, the star of the show is a young 21-year-old who is out to prove herself to the world after graduating from university.

But all chaos breaks loose when the ship she is travelling on breaks up and Lara is washed-up on a mysterious island.

All alone, she desperately searches for her mentor Captain Conrad Roth and any other survivors of the shipwreck.

The early plot sets the tone for what is bound to be a dark tale. Lara has to sneak past some gun-toting gang on the island who are not afraid to kill anyone in their path.

It’s a gritty angle which tells the story of how Lara goes from a frightened young woman to a hardened survivor.

I played through one of the opening levels of the game, which acts a tutorial for Crystal Dynamic’s new masterpiece.

Visually the game is inspired, with jungle greenery shining through and high-res raindrops dampening lost Lara’s spirits.

Her facial interpretation is also meticulous, with life-like qualities adding to her vulnerable yet plucky character.

Every hair, scratch and tear is beautifully rendered and results in a more human Lara, like you’ve never seen before.

Plus, she's voiced by actress Camilla Luddington - best known for playing Kate Middleton in American TV movie, William and Kate. 

Bow selecta: Never mind guns, Lara has to learn to use a bow and arrow first

The action-adventure sees a lot of physical running, jumping and climbing - just like the original games. However, there seems to be less of the acrobatics which Lara was famed for years ago.

After finding a bow & arrow, Lara goes hunting. The shooting mechanics work well as you draw an aim on a poor deer oblivious to the little hunter.

Lara also fends off three or four nasty wolves which leap out of the trees at her after she gets stuck in an animal trap.

Your main objective is highlighted when you jump into Survival Instinct vision. It’s similar to Detective Mode in Arkham games but only highlights clues and tips for a moment instead of being on constantly.

Campsites can be found jotted around the open world environment and here you can save your progress and upgrade weapons.

These Base Camps also allow you to customise Lara’s skill tree.

Sadly, there was a distinct lack of puzzles which were such a vital part of the original games but fingers crossed these will become more apparent as the title goes on.

I had a brief look at some later levels too which involved a lot of shooting, ducking and diving.

As well as stealthy takedowns, Lara later learns how explosive barrels can be just as effective and a headshot.

Hanging around: Set pieces break up the gameplay nicely - and look superb, too

From the looks of things, Tomb Raider is bang on track to make Lara’s return a successful one which stays true to the roots of this gaming icon.

Too often we have seen original ideas, concepts and characters tampered with years down the line in a desperate bid to make money.

Most of the time these cobbled together comebacks wilt and fade after being reintroduced to the spotlight.

But not Lara Croft...under this intense glare she shines even brighter than before.
