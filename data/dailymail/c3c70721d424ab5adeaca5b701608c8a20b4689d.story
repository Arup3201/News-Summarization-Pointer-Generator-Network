Martin Kaymer would love to compete against Tiger Woods in this week's US PGA Championship, but hinted that the 14-time major winner would be better off taking a lengthy break from the game.

Woods withdrew from the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational during Sunday's final round, the former world number one looking in severe pain from his back after hitting his tee shot on the ninth hole.

The 38-year-old was playing only his third tournament since undergoing back surgery on March 31 and has yet to announce if he will able to play at Valhalla, the venue where he won the US PGA in 2000 in a play-off with Bob May.

Woods' scheduled press conference on Tuesday was postponed, but US Open champion Kaymer, who played with Woods for the first two rounds in Akron, did speak to the media. 

'Obviously everybody wants him to be back at golf tournaments,' said Kaymer, whose eight-shot win at Pinehurst in June came without Woods in the field. 'If you win a big tournament without Tiger in the field you still feel very happy about it, but you want to play against him and it's nice if he's part of every tournament.

'He brings a lot of people into it. It has a different flair. When Tiger's playing in a golf tournament there's more entertainment and more people.

'It's such a shame that he had to pull out last week and I hope, and everybody hopes, that he will come back and play this week. On the other hand, I don't know how bad his injury is.

'It's tough to say. If I had injuries like this, I would probably make really, really sure that I'm healthy, because he's 38 years old, so hopefully he will have another 10, 15 years of competing against the guys on the PGA Tour and that he reaches his goal of 18 majors or maybe 19.'

Woods has up until just before his tee time of 8:35am local time on Thursday to decide whether to play or miss three of the year's four majors for the first time in his career.

Knee surgery in 2008 to replace his anterior cruciate ligament - just after his last major victory in the US Open at Torrey Pines - forced him to miss the Open and US PGA Championship. In 2011 he failed to tee it up at the US Open and the Open because of an Achilles complaint.

American Shawn Stefani is the first reserve at Valhalla and would play alongside Phil Mickelson and Padraig Harrington if Woods withdraws.
