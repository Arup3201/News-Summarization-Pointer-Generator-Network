Didier Drogba has made a habit of scoring against Arsenal throughout his career, with 13 goals in 14 appearances against them for Chelsea.

And it looks like the striker was trying to thwart the Gunners once again as he caught up with some old friends on their visit to London.

Drogba went to see his former Galatasaray team-mates at their hotel as they prepare to take on Arsenal in Wednesday night's Champions League clash at the Emirates.

And as someone who has plenty of experience of inflicting misery on the north London club, perhaps he had some useful tips to pass on. 

The Ivorian met coach Cesare Prandelli and chatted to Wesley Sneijder and Olcan Adin as the Galatasaray squad tucked in to their dinner.

Drogba spent two seasons with the Turkish club, scoring 20 goals in 53 matches, before returning for a second spell at Chelsea in the summer.

He helped Gala to the league title in 2013 and the Turkish Cup earlier this year.

Drogba has featured in six of Chelsea's matches so far this season, coming off the bench on each occasion.

He was not named in the squad that travelled to Lisbon for Tuesday's 1-0 win over Sporting in the Champions League.
