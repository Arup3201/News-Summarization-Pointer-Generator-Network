Paul McGrath always felt Roy Keane was in danger of becoming over-stretched by working for both the FAI, and for Aston Villa.

‘With the two jobs, there was no rest for him,’ said the former Villa and Irish defender yesterday.

‘He was trying to make sure Ireland get to the Euros and then going back to Villa and doing his best for them.

Paul McGrath said Roy Keane was always going to find it difficult balancing two different jobs

‘Ireland is a big job because you have to go around looking at players and seeing who is available, even under the grandparent rule. He has to go and watch players.

‘To add on the Villa job was a big ask. It seems now that it was too much for Roy.

He’s realised he can’t do both. I’m glad he’s stuck with Ireland,’ he added.

Asked if Keane might come to regret his decision, McGrath said, ‘Yeah, I think he might. But Roy will feel he’s done the right thing.

‘He can concentrate on Ireland. That was the job he had first.’

McGrath, who played in the ’94 World Cup finals with Keane, was astonished by the timing of the resignation, and believes Villa boss Paul Lambert was caught unawares too.

‘I was shocked when I heard that news this morning because Villa are in a tough spot at the moment so to get another shock like that will surprise Villa fans.

The former Manchester United captain was assistant manager for both Ireland and Aston Villa

‘I think it will have caught out the Villa staff, especially Paul Lambert, as it’s another big hurdle to be gotten over.

‘While I’m disappointed Roy has left, I’m still hopeful that we can dig our way out of trouble.’

Villa play at Burnley on Saturday, aware that a loss could drop the club into the relegation zone.

‘It’s a massive game for us because we’ve stopped the rot by drawing the last two games.

‘Now we’ve got to beat Burnley to move away from the bottom,’ said McGrath.

Former midfielder Ian Taylor, who played with McGrath in the Villa team which won the 1996 League Cup, feels there’s more to the story than meets the eye.

‘It is a bit strange. You just wonder about the reasons why,’ said the Villa club ambassador.

‘I think he’s said that because of the two roles, that he can’t do both. But I tend to think it might be a little bit more than that, although you have to go with what he (Keane) says.

‘Why not wait until after tomorrow and Tuesday as well, because they’re two big games for us. So it’s really bad timing.’

McGrath said he felt Villa boss Paul Lambert will have been shocked by Keane's sudden departure 

Taylor feels the Villa fans will miss Keane more than anyone.

‘They were always chanting his name, they loved his attitude; he was always up in the fourth official’s face. They had taken to him, probably a little bit more than the manager, to be honest,’ he said.

‘The fourth officials must have been fearful of Villa games because he (Keane) was always combative.’

‘I bumped into him a few weeks ago at the team hotel and had a good conversation with him about things.

‘He was saying “what is the fuss about, we’ve got good players at the football club and it’s only a matter of time before we turn things around.”’

Striker Darren Bent (below), who left Villa yesterday to go on loan at Brighton, paid tribute to the former Villa assistant manager.

‘Roy was fantastic for me. He would tell it as it is.

‘If you want to get better as a player you need people like him to tell you the truth.

‘I got on well with him and it’s a sorry loss for the club.’
