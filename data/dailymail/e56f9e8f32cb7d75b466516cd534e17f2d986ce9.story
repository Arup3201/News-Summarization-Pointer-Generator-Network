Death: Joan Parkes, pictured, was found dead in her hospital bed by her own daughter on a routine visit

A pensioner's daughter found her mother dead in a hospital bed as she arrived for a routine visit - and medics had not yet noticed.

Joan Parkes was admitted to Good Hope Hospital with a chest infection following a fall last March at her home nearby in Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands.

But her daughter Eleanor Johnson said that when she paid a visit six days later, she discovered her mother's body 'still warm' in the hospital bed.

Mrs Johnson raised the alarm only to discover a 'Do Not Resuscitate' notice had been put on her mother's notes without her consent, despite Mrs Parkes having a history of depression.

According to Mrs Johnson, nurses said they had checked on her mother half an hour before she arrived for the routine visit at 2.30pm on April 3, and the 88-year-old was alive.

But she hit out at the hospital over its care of her mother, who died of pneumonia and frailty.

'She deserved better care,' the school dinner lady told the Birmingham Mail. 'I am angry.

'The hospitals are bursting at the seams, so I have tried to make allowances for that. But she was failed, in some aspects, at the most basic levels.

'I arrived on the ward and had to tell them that she was dead. She just looked asleep. She was still warm.

'They felt her pulse, and they said "no I'm sorry, she's gone". I said, "can nothing be done?" - and they said "no, because she's agreed to this DNAR".

'I was shocked. It was the first I heard of it. If she had been so poorly to discuss a DNAR with her, why on earth hadn't they called a member of the family?

'Pneumonia hadn't even been mentioned to me. We had seen her the previous day and not one of us thought that this could have happened within 24 hours. Instead of being seen by the critical team, the nursing staff washed her hair. It's unbelievable.' 

The hospital has apologised to Mrs Johnson after she lodged a catalogue of claims, including that nurses miscalculated the pensioner's 'early warning score' showing how ill she was.

Had they calculated it correctly, claimed Mrs Johnson, it would have led to an immediate call to the critical outreach team and a junior doctor.

And she said nurses failed to check on aspects of the grandmother's care for more than seven hours, instead of every 30 minutes, and failed to give Mrs Parkes her anti-anxiety medication Sertraline for three days.

Good Hope Hospital apologised to Mrs Johnson in a letter, which admits her mother was 'let down', and have mounted an investigation into the full circumstances of the incident.

She added: 'If they had observed my mum like they should, and alerted the critical team like they should, it's possible she wouldn't have died that day.

'Observations were missed, medication was missed, documentation was missed and communication was awful.

'On the surface her care appeared OK, but when I looked at the medical notes they told a different story.

'They let Mum down, they let me down, they let the family down. So I think they looked at her and thought "well, she's 88". I think that does go on a lot in hospitals today.' 

Tales: Good Hope Hospital made headlines just days ago for not realising a pensioner was virtually blind

Mrs Parkes was admitted to the hospital by paramedics on March 28 following a fall at her home.

She had visited her GP the day before with a small chest infection and was prescribed antibiotics.

She died on April 3 from pneumonia and frailty.

Mrs Johnson added: 'My mum had a long history of depression and anxiety.

Mrs Parkes' daughter said: 'I don't want another family to go through this'

'Without my knowledge her medication hadn't been given to her for three days. We had been warned by her GP that this could lead to serious side-effects.

'Alone, feeling ill and depressed, I doubt she had the mental capacity to make such a weighty decision regarding a "Do Not Resuscitate" notice herself.

'I don't want another family to go through this. I could have looked after her better at home.'

Richard Parker, the hospital's managing director, said: 'We take the safety and care of all of our patients very seriously and have undertaken a detailed investigation into the care Mrs Parkes received.

'I would like to apologise to Mrs Johnson and would welcome an opportunity to meet with her to discuss any aspect of her mother's care during her time here.'

The case was revealed days after it emerged a pensioner was found dehydrated and groping for food at the same hospital because nurses failed to realise she was virtually blind.

Good Hope also apologised for its care of 82-year-old Margaret Jones, who was admitted following a fall in June.

Staff were told the pensioner's eyes could only pick out light and dark, said her daughter Rosalind Waite-Jones, but put food and medicine out of her reach.

Mrs Jones later suffered a serious infection which has impeded her brain function and left her in a care home for the rest of her life.
