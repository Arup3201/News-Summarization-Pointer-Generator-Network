The Rabbi behind the Los Angeles Kabbalah Center, who attracted followers including Madonna, Britney Spears and Demi Moore, died today, aged 86.

Rabbi Philip Berg, known as Rav by his devotees, had been in declining health since a stroke in 2004.

The 86-year-old Rabbi was best known for bring Jewish mysticism to the masses through the center he set up in 1965.

At the height of its popularity, celebrities including Paris Hilton, Rosie O'Donnell and Lindsay Lohan could all be seen wearing the red thread bracelet associated with Kabbalah - an ancient practice usually reserved for Jewish scholars.

Demi Moore and Ashtun Kutcher held their 2005 wedding at the Los Angeles center and Madonna has donated millions to the center and says Kabbalah inspired her 1998 album Ray of Light.

Rav 'left us with incredible knowledge through
thousands of hours of teaching, examples of courage that we will never 
forget, and the comfort of a Kabbalah Centre that we can all call home,' a statement from the center said today.

The Los Angeles center, which was founded in 1965, has attracted criticism for the lucrative and celebrity-friendly way it presents ancient Jewish mysticism, according to the Los Angeles Times.

But the center said Berg had 'created a path for millions to learn and live Kabbalah'.

The New York rabbi gave up his career in business to learn from Rav Yehuda Brandwein, one of the greatest kabbalists of the last century.

He followed him to Israel to learn more and, when he returned to the U.S, started looking for ways to make the religion more accessible.

Celebrity followers were easily recognized by the $26 red thread bracelet, said to ward off evil, that they would wear.

Roseanne Barr credits its spiritual teachings with changing her life. '[Kabbalah] helped me to totally reconfigure my entire being, the way I thought, the way I did everything,' she told USA Today in 2004.

In an interview with MTV's Kurt Loader, Madonna explained a friend had introduced her to the teachings of 'this charismatic Rabbi'.

'The thing about it is there's similarities to Buddhism ... you have to take responsibility for the chaos in your life,' she said.

Madonna remained close to Rav and his family, helping to fund and set up a Kabbalah Center in London's Mayfair, and donating at least $18 million, according to the Times of Israel.

And Madonna's ex-husband Guy Ritchie 
is said to have defended it by saying: 'The difference between Kabbalah 
and Catholicism is the amount of people ... You don't call Catholicism a
cult.'

The organization, which also sells blessed water, has assets worth hundreds of millions of dollars, according to The Hollywood Reporter.

Mystical: Rabbi Berg was credited with bringing the ancient branch of Judaism to the masses

The first branch was opened in 1922, and Kabbalah now has centers in more than 40 cities around the world.

The website for the Los Angeles branch describes the religion as 'the world's oldest body of spiritual wisdom' containing 'the long-hidden keys to the secrets of the universe as well as to the mysteries of the human heart and soul'.

Rav's wife will and two sons will continue to run the center. The Rabbi, who was ordained in 1951, is to be buried next week in the Israel city of Safed, said to be a center of Jewish mysticism, the Jewish Daily Forward reported.
