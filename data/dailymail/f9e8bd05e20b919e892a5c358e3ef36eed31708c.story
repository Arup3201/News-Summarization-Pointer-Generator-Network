All of a sudden Leicester find themselves in a spot of bother and luck hasn’t been given a squad number.

That much was obvious two minutes into the second half when, having dominated the first 45 minutes, it all went calamitously wrong.

An innocuous cross from Saido Berahino was cleared by Wes Morgan’s head but from there it clattered against Esteban Cambiasso. Back it went and in it bounced.

City’s demolition of Manchester United seems a long time ago now, with their subsequent five games yielding four defeats and a draw.

The drama is not quite a crisis but the poor run is enough to worry manager Nigel Pearson.

‘You could argue we were slightly unlucky,’ he said. ‘We are in a difficult run at the moment. I have belief in the group we have but we need consistent performances that allow us to compete in games.’

That is proving easier said than done, though for inspiration Pearson might have stolen a glance at West Brom’s bench. Alan Irvine was subjected to quite absurd abuse from elements of the club’s support when he was appointed in the summer, but a run of one defeat in six Premier League games serves as a vindication.

‘I am absolutely delighted with the result,’ said Irvine, whose much-changed side were dumped out of the Capital One Cup by Bournemouth on Tuesday. ‘I will take goals like that. It was fortunate the way it went in.’

He added: ‘I am not satisfied with what happened on Tuesday — I am still hurting about that. But the fact is that had we played the same team on Tuesday as last weekend, we would have risked problems at the end of this game.

‘We needed players who were physically and mentally ready to cope and they did really well.’

For Pearson, at the very least it was a vast improvement on their offering, or more specifically their application, in last weekend’s defeat at Swansea.

At the Liberty Stadium, they lacked intensity and any kind of sharp edge. Here, with four changes to the side that lost 2-0 in Wales, including the injury-demotion of Leonardo Ulloa to the bench, only one of those factors was an issue.

Matt James                     90         12.6      7.8

Craig Gardner                90          11.6      7.2

Chris Brunt                     90          11.5      7.1

But how many games will you win when only five of 14 shots hit the target — and too few of those troubling the keeper?

Within three minutes, Andy King had a free header inside the six-yard box. It travelled weakly into Ben Foster’s arms. Danny Drinkwater then ballooned over the bar.

West Brom almost capitalised moments later but Berahino followed a moment of quick thinking with slow feet. Having beaten Marcin Wasilewski’s offside trap, he dallied and let the defender get a block in.

Leicester’s Jamie Vardy was then brought down by Joleon Lescott but Stuart Attwell, refereeing his first Premier League fixture since 2012, refused to point to the spot. More blatant was Sebastien Pocognoli’s hold on Vardy at a corner soon after, which also went unpunished, as did Wasilewski’s second-half elbow on Berahino.

That latter incident looked bad, even if Irvine said he had no problems with it, having not seen a replay.

The real sucker punch came in the 47th minute when Chris Brunt threaded a pass to Berahino. The 21-year-old hit a low cross from the left and Morgan headed against Cambiasso, who nudged the ball past Kasper Schmeichel.

Ulloa, who had been struggling with a groin problem, came on with 22 minutes remaining and nearly saved his side with a cross from the right that King headed straight at Foster.

Such small margins and bad luck could have big consequences for Leicester.
