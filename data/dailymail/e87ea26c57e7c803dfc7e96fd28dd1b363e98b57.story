A judge says Marion 'Suge' Knight will stay behind bars until his next court hearing at the end of March in the case of a deadly hit-and-run.

The co-founder of Death Row Records sat at the back of the court room looking relaxed and sipping water days after his shock hospitalization for a panic attack. 

Addressing the rap mogul's bail-review, a prosecutor and Knight's attorney asked for a delay until March 20.

Staying behind bars: Marion 'Suge' Knight, 49, appeared in court on Monday (pictured) to hear he will remain in jail until his postponed bail-review hearing on March 20. He denies murder, attempted murder and hit-and-run

Knight, 49, has been charged with murder, attempted murder and hit-and-run after authorities say he ran down and killed one man and seriously injured another in a parking lot. 

He was hospitalized last Tuesday when he fell into a panic attack moments after pleading not guilty to all charges.

Armed guards reportedly watched over Knight in hospital.

TMZ reported that doctors discovered he had a blood clot and he was treated with blood thinners.

Knight's blood clots have been an ongoing health problem for him since he was shot six times last summer.

He nearly died from a clot several weeks back when he was in a Las Vegas jail. 

Back behind bars:  Knight was arrested for murder on January 30, 2015 in connection with a hit-and-run accident that killed one person near Los Angeles

Knight's attorneys have said he was trying to flee a vicious attack January 29 when he hit the men with his pickup truck. 

Authorities allege Knight killed one man, 55, and injured another, Cle 'Bone' Sloan, 51, with his pickup truck on Thursday near a film set in Compton. Police say he fled the scene.

Knight was out on bail in a separate robbery case at the time.

Marion 'Suge' Knight had a long-standing 'beef' with the man he is charged with attempting to murder by mowing him down in his truck, Daily Mail Online revealed last week.

Cle 'Bone' Sloan, 51, was knocked unconscious and has a 'mangled' foot after the collision last week, an incident which saw music producer Terry Carter, 55, killed.

And the actor and filmmaker - who has been employed as a consultant on hit movies such as Training Day - fears his injuries could bring his career to an abrupt end.

Sloan is furious that Knight allegedly 'went ballistic' after a row erupted on the set of the film 'Straight Outta Compton, a production about the rise of the rap group N.W.A.

Sloan had worked hard to convince rap legend and music producer Dr Dre to come to Compton to be involved in the film.

But a source close to Sloan said Knight ruined the 'beautiful' moment by sparking a heated row.

He is due back in court on March 20 as both sides said they needed more time to prepare for a bail-review.
