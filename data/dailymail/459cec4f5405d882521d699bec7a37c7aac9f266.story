The ICC have banned Moeen Ali from wearing wristbands saying ‘Save Gaza’ and ‘Free Palestine’.

The investigation by international cricket's governing body came after Moeen was pictured on MailOnline wearing the wristbands while batting during on the second day of England's third Test against India.

The match referee David Boon banned the batsman from wearing the wristband and an ICC statement said: 'The ICC Equipment and Clothing Regulations do not permit the display of messages that relate to political, religious or racial activities or causes during an international match.

'Moeen Ali was told by the Match Referee that whilst he is free to express his views on such causes away from the cricket field, he is not permitted to wear the wristbands on the field of play and warned not to wear the bands again during an international match.'

Moeen could be fined up 
50 per cent of his match fee for a level one contravention if the ICC deem he has breached regulations.

The ICC code reads: ‘Players and team 
officials shall not be permitted to wear, display or otherwise convey 
messages through arm bands or other items affixed to clothing or 
equipment unless approved in advance by the player or team official’s 
Board.

'Approval shall not be granted for messages which relate to political, religious or racial activities or causes.’

The
 ECB confirmed on Monday night that Ali had not asked their permission, 
although a spokesman said: ‘We do not believe Moeen has committed an 
offence.’ 

England’s
 players will on Tuesday wear ‘Help for Heroes’ charity logos on their shirt 
collars in support of the wounded service charity, while there will be a
 minute’s silence observed at 10.56am in memory of the 100 year 
anniversary of the start of World War I.
