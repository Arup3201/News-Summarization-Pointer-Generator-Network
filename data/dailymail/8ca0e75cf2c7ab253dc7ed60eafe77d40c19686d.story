It's a heart stopping moment that Rex Wallman, 51, has carried with him since he was nine years old.

Rex and his brother David, 11, had set out from their family sugar cane farm at Eimeo, then a village and now a suburb of the Queensland coastal city of Mackay, on the morning of March 21, 1972.

They were only ten minutes behind their sister, 14-year-old Marilyn Joy Wallman  who had ridden on her bicycle at 7.42am  a short distance down a country lane to the Rural Youth Hall at the junction of Wallmans and Eimeo Road, Mackay to catch the 8am school bus.

Spinning wheels: Ten minutes after 14-year-old Marilyn Wallman (pictured) took off on her bicycle for the school bus in Mackay, Queensland, her brothers came across her bicycle with its wheel still spinning on a track between  cane fields from which her brother Rex heard her muffled screams

Kidnapped: Marilyn Wallman's bicycle (pictured) on the track between cane fields where her brothers found it, her school hat and her bag with its contents strewn across the grass. They never saw their sister again

The two brothers followed the same route as their sister. Around one kilometre from home and just 300m before the youth hall, they and found Marilyn's bicycle.

Her school bag was on the ground, its contents scattered in the grass. Her school hat lay a few metres away, in the six foot (183cm) high sugar cane which lined both sides of the track.

The bicycle was on its side, its front wheel still spinning. David ran home to alert their mother, Daphne, while Rex  waited by the bicycle.

Scouring the bush: In March 1972 local volunteers (pictured) searched fields and bush in a 160km radius of the Mackay suburb of Eimeo  for Marilyn Wallman, 14,  who was kidnapped on the way to school and murdered

Never gave up: John Wallman (left, with searchers in a cane field) never gave up looking for his only daughter after she was abducted, he and wife Daphne travelling as far as Western Australia when they received news of alleged sightings of  missing 14-year-old Marilyn

Body dumped: Police believe 14-year-old Marilyn Wallman was kidnapped in March 1972 at Eimeo in Mackay, murdered and her body dumped 40km inland at McGregors Creek where part of her skull was found in 1974

Later, Rex would tell his parents he thought he heard Marilyn's voice from within the sugar cane, saying that her legs hurt, and muffled screams. He would never see or hear his sister again.

When Mrs Wallman turned up with David, the three of them searched the area, Rex Wallman seeing a small creek bed clearly with marks 'where two people had walked through very recently', but the footprints soon became trampled over by searchers.

In the ensuing days and weeks, hundreds of police and local volunteers walked shoulder to shoulder through the canefields and bush searching for Marilyn.

The missing girl's father, John Wallman, accompanied his neighbours and police as they scoured more than 160 kilometres of roads, creeks and gullies in the district.

Lost innocence: As hundreds of locals gathered  (pictured) to search, the news of Marilyn Wallman's probable abduction and murder changed attitudes and fearful parents began driving their children to school

Dams and properties were searched and hundreds of people interviewed. Police followed up a sighting of three cars seen on the same morning at the spot where Marilyn went missing, and interviewed two of the cars' owners.

They failed to identify the third vehicle, which may have been a grey or blue Vauxhall which matched the car owned by Arthur Stanley Brown, whose name has been associated with several child murders.

Police concluded she had been abducted and murdered and questioned several suspects, including convicted sex offenders, but no charges were laid.

Abducted and murdered: Since his sister Marilyn (pictured) was murdered in 1972, Rex Wallman said he won't give up finding her killer 'till I die'

The case sent shock waves around Australia and it changed the laid back attitude of Mackay's population, with many parents thereafter driving their children to school.

As David Wallman said later, 'When we were kids we could go anywhere on our farm and the neighbours. We’d go off on our pushbikes, drive a tractor, go to the neighbours, mucked around with kids on our bikes. 

'We’d have a time to be home by, and off we’d go, bare feet, we roamed the countryside and everyone felt safe. I don’t even think Mum and Dad had a lock on the door.

'Nobody would lock a door and I don’t think anyone had anything stolen. You’d walk straight into someone’s house and the doors’d open and there’d be no-one home.'

Mrs Wallman later noted that both her sons were deeply affected afterwards, particularly Rex who was grilled by police about what he heard in the cane, asking him, 'Are you sure you’re not telling lies?'.

Daphne and John Wallman continued to search for their daughter, going as far as Western Australia after people contacted them with possible sightings of Marilyn.

Two years after Marilyn Wallman vanished, a railway worker found a partial skull in grass near McGregor Creek, about 40km from where her brother had found her bicycle.

Queensland police conducted forensic tests on the skull with the help of the FBI and the New Zealand Institute of Environmental Science, but they proved inconclusive. 

Last year, they put the skull into a laboratory for DNA testing and made a breakthrough, matching it to DNA Taken from Marilyn Wallman's relatives.

Queensland Police Assistant Commissioner Mike Condon, who will announce the breakthrough today said the remains had been returned to Marilyn’s family 'who are obviously quite relieved and have never given up their drive to find out who is responsible for the murder'.

Rex Wallman will speak about his sister at the media conference and has stated that he won't give up on finding his sister's killer 'until I die'. 

The Queensland Government is offering a $250,000 reward for information leading to Marilyn's killer.

Anyone with information should call Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000
