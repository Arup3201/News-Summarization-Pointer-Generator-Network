Galen Hawk, 26, has pleaded not guilty to a negligent-homicide charge after shooting a three-year-old boy

A man who shot dead a three-year-old with a gun he pointed at the little boy but  did not think was loaded has pleaded not guilty to negligent homicide.

Prosecutors allege Galen Hawk, 26, from Montana, had been drinking when he shot Lonato Moran-Allen in the back, after he saw the child holding his gun and took it away.

Hawk told authorities he was playing with the boy at the child's home in home in Ninepipes. He said the boy ran away from him and then looked back while pretending to shoot a toy gun.

In response, Hawk pointed his gun at the child and pulled the trigger, believing the weapon was not loaded because the magazine was in his pocket.

Following the shooting, Hawk attempted to perform CPR on the boy before driving him to a hospital in Ronan where he later died, just weeks before his fourth birthday.

Hawk told investigators he had been drinking whiskey and alcoholic lemonade during the evening prior to the shooting. 

He entered the not guilty plea to a negligent homicide charge and District Judge James Manley set a March 2 trial date. 

If convicted, Hawk faces up to 20 years in prison. He remains jailed on $100,000 bail.

According to KBZK, Hawk's defense attorney Matt Pavelich previously attempted to reduce his  bail, arguing that he is not a threat to the community.

He said: 'I don't see Mr Hawk as a threat to run, with respect to any danger that he represents to the community. 

'I believe that could be curtailed by the imposition of 24-7 alcohol monitoring.'

Deputy Lake County Attorney James Lapotka disagreed. 

He showed a weapon in court similar to the one used by Hawk. 

'He chose to take a handgun, similar to this one, a 380 handgun, loaded, while he was intoxicated and pointed it at a child, and discharged that firearm, ' Mr Lapotka said.

KBZK also reported that Lonato was in the custody of a woman who was at the home at the time of the shooting, but she told investigators that she was unaware of any guns being in the house.
