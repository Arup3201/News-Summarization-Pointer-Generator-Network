Spring flowers are blooming early as a result of the mild, less wet winter. 

The National Trust's annual Valentine's flower count found a 11 per cent increase on last year.

Gardeners and volunteers recorded blooms at National Trust properties across the South West, where spring tends to arrive earliest.

Blooming: Spring flowers, such as snowdrops, are in bloom earlier this year as a result of the mild winter. The National Trust's annual flower count found an increase of 11 per cent on last year 

They counted 1,345 flowers at 18 gardens in Devon and Cornwall, compared with 1,205 in 2014 – but still far below the record of 3,335 in 2008.

Camellias have been in bloom in Cornwall since November and the warm weather last week has boosted snowdrops and aconites, the Trust said. 

But a cold snap appears to have slowed the earliest spring some gardeners had seen. 

The gardens of Lanhydrock near Bodmin, Cornwall, have the most flowers in bloom. Head gardener Tommy Teagle said: 'It promises to be a colourful spring providing the weather is good.'

Ian Wright, National Trust gardens adviser in the South West, said: 'Comparing the number of plants across our gardens on a set day each year gives us a real insight into how our gardens respond to weather patterns, and is a useful barometer for the season ahead.

'You can almost map the progress of spring as it travels from west to east, south to north by way of the flowers in our gardens.

'I would thoroughly recommend getting out there and reaffirming your senses with "all things nature". 

'I always marvel at how uplifted you can feel after spotting your first swathe of daffodils or magnolias in flower against a crisp, blue sky.' 

The National Trust asked supporters to vote for their favourite spring flower. Snowdrops came first, ahead of daffodils and primroses.

Tommy Teagle, head gardener at Lanhydrock, said: 'We've had 146 plants in flowers this year, over 100 of the plants are camellias and the daphne is smelling superb.

'Overall there is a plethora of buds on the plants and it promises to be a colourful spring providing the weather is good.'

Across the whole of the South West, 1,622 plants were recorded in this year's count, compared with 1,454 in 2014. The gardens of Lanhydrock near Bodmin, Cornwall, have the most flowers in bloom. 

But the cold snap appears to have slowed down the earliest spring the head gardener at Glendurgan, near Falmouth, had ever seen, leading to the biggest drop in the number of blooms of any of the gardens compared with last year, from 98 down to 73.
