It's no exaggeration to say that these incredible motorbikes really do run like clockwork.

But its not because of their superior engines or incredible handling - its because they are actually made from discarded parts from watches.

The motorbikes measure on average six to eight inches long and three to five high and can sell for as much £700.

Stunning: The model bikes have been created by talented artist Dan Tanenbaum, 41, from Toronto in Canada

Parts for the models consist of faces, bezels, hands and mechanisms destined for the rubbish bin from as many as 50 different watches per motorcycle.

They have been created by talented artist Dan Tanenbaum, 41, from Toronto in Canada.

He started making the models as a way to release creativity energy and admits he is a watch fan first and actually didn't know too much about motorbikes when he began.

But now with a Facebook page and orders flooding in from around the world, Mr Tanenbaum is being kept busy.

Dad-of-three  Mr Tanenbaum said the UK and Europe were actually his biggest market for the bikes.

He said: 'If you look at a motorcycle a lot of them are custom made and once you have two wheels, handle bars and a petrol tank you can pretty much express yourself with the rest.

'All of the watch parts I use, some of which are from vintage watches, are destined for the trash so using them is my way of recycling the craftsmanship that is so detailed.

'It can take 40 to 50 hours to build one piece and my favourite is probably a Triumph Bonneville.

Amazing: Each bike is made from parts from up to 50 watches

'When I was first starting motorcycle fans would guide me through each build and now if I get an order, depending on the quality of the pictures I am sent, I can build it.

'I often ask people what they particularly remember about the bike and I concentrate on that section.

'I haven't had too much trouble from watch enthusiasts because they know that these parts were going into the bin.

'I do have people asking if they can turn their grandmother's watch into a bike but each piece is made from parts from up to 50 watches.'
