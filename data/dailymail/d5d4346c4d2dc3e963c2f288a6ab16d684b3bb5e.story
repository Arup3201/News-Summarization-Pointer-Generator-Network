Manchester United are discussing the possibility of a contract until 2016 for goalkeeper Victor Valdes.

The 32-year-old has been rehabilitating at United from his knee cruciate ligament injury and has been very popular around the training ground.

Despite all his success with Barcelona, Valdes cuts a shy and humble figure with a good attitude and that has impressed staff and teammates alike.

United are looking to let Anders Lindegaard return to Scandinavia while they will not stand in the way of Ben Amos should a club come in for him.

United have told the former England Under 21 international that they will not stand in his way if he receives other offers. Lindegaard, meanwhile, has been linked with Molde.

The 30-year-old Dane almost left Old Trafford last summer when Van Gaal made an unsuccessful attempt to hijack Kenneth Vermeer’s move from Ajax to Feyenoord with a player-plus-cash bid.

Lindegaard has since drifted out of contention as a serious rival to De Gea and has not played at all this season. It was thought he might have been called up for Sunday’s FA Cup tie at Yeovil but Van Gaal left him on the bench again.

United have high hopes that 19-year-old Joel Perreira could provide reliable back-up as the season develops.

Meanwhile, midfield prospect Ben Pearson is in talks to join Barnsley on loan.

The England U19 international is highly thought of at United as one of their best prospects and has been eager to get out on loan to gain more experience.

Preston have been keen to take him also and he said: ‘Hopefully I can go out on loan. I’m not sure if I’m ready yet. You’ve just got to throw yourself into it and see what happens. The manager has played a few youngsters already. Tyler [Blackett] has been playing regularly and Reece James has played. The manager has done it previously at Ajax and Barcelona and I hope he can do it here.’
