In an age where more people live on their own and it’s normal to meet total strangers in a bar for a date, it can be reassuring to be checked up on.

Instead of relying on friends or protective parents to check up on your whereabouts, a new service can send you with a text message to check you are safe instead.

Kitestring sends a user's emergency contacts a text message if they do not reply to a 'check in' message on their phone.

The free service uses text messages so it can be used by people without a smartphone and in areas without an internet connection.

It was invented by Stephan Boyer, in San Francisco to keep his girlfriend safe.

The 23-year old MIT computer science graduate told Elle.com: 'My girlfriend, who lives in a dangerous neighbourhood in San Francisco, called to ask me to check up on her as she was walking home from work one day.

'I wondered if there might be an app or service that could offer a little extra safety for her when she goes out at night.'

Anyone wanting to use the service can set up an account on Kitestring’s website, where they enter their phone number plus an emergency contact, as well as writing an alert message which will be sent to their chosen contact when needed.

To use the service, people schedule a time and date for when they plan to be out and estimate how long they will be.

Kitestring is a personal safety service, self-described as an 'overprotective mom'.

How does it work? Users can ask Kitestring to check up on them at a specified time in the future and it will text them to make sure they’re safe.

A user must reply to the message - or check in on the website - and all is well. If they don’t check in, Kitestring alerts their emergency contacts.

It is possible to extend a trip or start a new trip if a user will be much later than they planned.

Extra security: People can set up a password to stop savvy attackers pretending to be them.

A ‘secret duress code’ can also be used to send an alert message to emergency contacts in a moment of peril.Cost: The basic version is free for 8 trips a month and there is no app to download.

For £2 a month, people can make unlimited trips and have multiple emergency contacts. They can also customise their check-in period.

Compatibility: The service uses text messages so it works on any mobile phone in 217 countries.

They can text Kitestring a duration like ‘45m’ to start a trip, for example, or click on options on the company's website.

When that time has passed, Kitestring sends a text message asking for confirmation that the person is safe.

Users can 
extend a trip by testing ‘ETA 15m’ for example, to receive another
 text 15 minutes later, or can start another new trip if they expect to later than an hour after they originally said.

Their
 emergency contact or contacts are alerted with a distress message if the service 
doesn’t hear back from a user within five minutes of checking up on them
 with a text message.

This time frame can be altered by premium users who pay £2 a month for multiple emergency contacts and other extras. But if someone’s phone battery runs flat, contacts will still be notified, which could cause unnecessary panic.

This is because the ‘notifications system runs on our servers and does not depend on your phone being available,’ the company says.

Because the service works using text messages, it makes itself useable by more people than previous ‘safecall’ apps for smartphones, which often rely on an internet connection and GPS.

Kitestring works in 217 countries, which could also make it handy for backpackers and other holidaymakers exploring a new area on their own.

The service could be sued by backpackers in far flung places, or simply by people walking home in the dark (illustrated), meeting someone for the first time or when travelling through dubious neighborhoods where they feel unsafe. Unlike other services, Kitestring only needs basic mobile reception to send and receive a text
