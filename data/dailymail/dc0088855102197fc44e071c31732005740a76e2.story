An Australian DJ who travelled thousands of miles to meet a British schoolgirl after persuading her to film pornographic clips of herself and post them on the internet has been jailed.

Lucius Lockyer, 41, flew from Sydney to meet the vulnerable youngster in Glasgow.

He was jailed for ten months on Wednesday, but last night it emerged that he has already walked free from jail under Scotland's early release rules for offenders with shorter sentences.

 'A sexual predator': Australian DJ Lucius Lockyer, who travelled 10,000 miles to meet a 14-year-old British girl after getting her to pose naked online

Lockyer had been chatting online to the 14-year-old – who cannot be named for legal reasons – for months before gradually talking her into making the images and uploading the pictures to adult websites where millions of people could view them.

He was arrested by police acting on a tip-off before appearing at a Glasgow court in October last year.

As well as his jail sentence a sheriff at Airdrie Sheriff Court also ordered to be placed on the sex offenders register for ten years after he admitted inciting a person under 18 to upload indecent images of herself on to pornographic websites.

Last night, his victim told how Lockyer drew her into the dark world of internet pornography.

She said: ‘lt started off innocently. The first few times he tried to talk to me I ignored him.

‘He told me he was 33 and I didn’t see the harm in talking to him as he didn’t even live in the same country as me.

‘He would tell me I was beautiful and clever and funny and we spoke every day.

‘Then we started sending pictures and videos to each other. But over time he would ask me to do this or do that. He started encouraging me to upload pictures and videos of myself on to adult sites.’

She added: ‘He told me he was coming to see me.

‘He called me and said he was in London and he would come and see me the next day in Glasgow.

‘It later came out what age he was and he was arrested.’

Depute fiscal Anne Hilley told Airdrie Sheriff Court: ‘They began conversations on Skype, which were private.

‘There
 were several discussions and the accused sent several videos of himself
 engaging in sexual acts and the complainer sent pictures of herself.

‘On analysis of Skype logs between January 2013 and April 2013, there are records of the accused occasionally encouraging the complainer to upload naked videos of herself on to a site and  he gave advice of how to do it anonymously.’

Defence lawyer Gary McAteer said: ‘The
 court now has before it a full narrative into the case and a background
 report on my client.

‘Key to that report and my submission is the risk assessment part. It states that he poses a low risk to the public.

‘He
 has already spent five months in prison in custody and given that, and 
what the reports say about a low risk, I would ask that the sentence 
reflects that.’

Lockyer spent months chatting with the youngster every day on 
Skype, during which told her she was 'funny and clever' before 
persuading to pose naked in self-shot pornographic clips and post them 
online

Sheriff Morag Galbraith sentenced Lockyer to ten months in prison, backdated five months to October last year.

A
 Crown Office spokesman said: ‘Lucius Loren Lockyer appeared on petition
 at the Sheriff Court at Glasgow on October 9, 2013, charged with a 
number of sexual offences.

'Following
 full and careful consideration of all of the facts and circumstances in
 this case, including the available evidence, Crown Counsel instructed 
that the case should be heard at summary level.

‘This decision and the reasoning behind it was explained to the complainer.’

An outraged relative of the schoolgirl said: ‘He is a sexual predator.

‘I’m older and wiser and I know a 41-year-old man has nothing in common with a young girl. He took advantage of her.’

Out: Sheriff Morag Galbraith, sitting at Airdrie Sheriff Court, sentenced Lockyer to ten months in prison, backdated five months to October last year. The lenient sentence means he has already been released from jail

Last night, it emerged Lockyer has already been released from jail.

Prisoners who receive a sentence of less than four years can be freed halfway through their term under early release rules.

Sex offenders who are jailed for between six months and four years are also released but are kept on licence.

They are liable to be recalled to custody for the remainder of their sentence if they breach their conditions.

Last year, First Minister Alex Salmond said automatic early release was to be ended for prisoners who present the most serious potential risks to the public.
