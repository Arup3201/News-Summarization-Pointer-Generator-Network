An Ohio woman's run in with the law likely would've stayed in Ohio if only she'd resisted the urge to make the ridiculous face displayed in her mug shot which is now going viral.

According to a post on the Wickliffe Police Department Facebook page, Angela Green, 34, was arrested after refusing to leave her hotel room at the Quality Inn Saturday. 

Shortly after noon, the hotel's management called police requesting help in getting Green and male companion Brian Baker, of Cleveland to leave room 253. 

Cleveland woman Angela Green took an outrageous mugshot Saturday when she was arrested after refusing to leave her hotel room room

'The officer explained that they needed to leave or 
rent the room for another day and the female became loud and 
uncooperative.' the post noted. 

'As the 
couple was being escorted from the building it was discovered that she 
had provided fictitious information,' the post continued. 'Once outside, the female continued
 to become loud and uncooperative and refused to identify herself.  
After a brief struggle the female was arrested and transported to the 
WPD.'

Green, of Cleveland, was then charged with obstructing official business.

For reasons known only to her, Green decided to puff up her lips and present a mugshot it appears she was arrested for imitating a blowfish.

The post has since received 199 likes and 150 comments as of the time of this writing, as well as appearing on several blogs and news sites.

'Is that what they used to call a come-hither look?' joked Facebook user Tom Klaber.

'Duck Face x10,' joked poster Amanda Sojka. 

She was finally released on $354 cash bond and her new online celebrity.
