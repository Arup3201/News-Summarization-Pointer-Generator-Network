Half a million people will be left 20 miles from their nearest A&E under ‘deeply worrying’ plans to cut two neighbouring casualty units.

The imminent threats are to the A&Es in Milton Keynes and Bedford, which between them serve at least 500,000 people in an area with a fast-growing population.

GPs have drawn up the cost-cutting plans as they face a £30 million black hole in their NHS finances.

The A&E in Milton Keynes is facing closure in 'crazy' plans to help plug a £30 million hole in NHS finances

If both units close, emergency patients will have to go to Northampton, Kettering or Luton for life-saving treatment. All are at least 20 miles away from both towns.

For the past two years The Mail on Sunday has been fighting to save A&Es from closure. The latest threats mean there are now 16 units across England facing the axe.

Both A&Es could close next year, despite warnings from Simon Stevens, new chief executive of the NHS, that England’s emergency services are already ‘quite concentrated’ and they should not be cut from ‘viable local hospitals’ without very careful thought.

Last night, politicians and health campaigners condemned the plans. Andrew Pakes, Labour’s prospective parliamentary candidate for Milton Keynes South, said: ‘I’ve never seen the NHS under so much pressure here. Right now we are in the middle of a summer A&E crisis in Milton Keynes, with record numbers turning up. Any plan to downgrade A&E services here or in Bedford is absolutely crazy.

‘Milton Keynes is one of the fastest growing areas in the country, and within ten years it will be the biggest urban area in the South East outside London. They should be expanding, not downgrading.’

He believed forcing sick patients to travel so far for emergency treatment would be ‘deeply worrying’.

Jayne Beard, of the Bedford Hospitals Charity, said she was ‘absolutely devastated’ to hear the town could lose its A&E, adding: ‘It can easily take 45 minutes to get to Northampton or Luton in the rush hour. That’s not funny if you’re in immediate need of medical attention.’ But she vowed: ‘People won’t give up easily. We will fight.’

The proposals are outlined in a new public document drawn up by Bedfordshire and Milton Keynes’s clinical commissioning groups (CCGs), the local NHS authorities that pay a large chunk of the hospitals’ bills.

The GPs who run the groups have outlined 14 scenarios for the two hospitals. Only three involve both hospitals retaining full A&Es.

Eight involve one hospital retaining its A&E and the other’s being downgraded to either an ‘integrated care hub’ or an ‘urgent care centre’. The latter would have no beds for emergency patients. Elsewhere, some urgent care centres deal with only minor injuries at night.

The remaining three options would see both A&Es closed.

The GPs have pitched their plans as letting ‘the public have their say on ideas for health services’. But even before consultation begins this autumn, they have effectively ruled out retaining both A&Es, stating that ‘sustaining emergency surgery on both sites is not sustainable’.

Experts say there is no point having an A&E without being able to do emergency surgery, so both almost always get stripped out at the same time. At the moment both hospitals are classed as ‘major emergency centres’. A spokesman for the review said there were simply too few people in the area to justify keeping such a service at both hospitals – since guidelines suggest each of them alone requires a catchment area of about 500,000 people to be ‘clinically viable’.

According to the Milton Keynes and Bedfordshire CCGs, the NHS in the area has a ‘spending gap’  of £30 million and growing. The group wants to spend more on GP and community services to keep people out of hospital longer – but to pay for that they need to cut hospital services.

Downgrading Bedford’s A&E and stripping it of most emergency services is thought to be the most likely option.
