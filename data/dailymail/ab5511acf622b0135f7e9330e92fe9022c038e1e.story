Labour's shadow business secretary said British workers needed to be as productive as the French

Britain's economy needs to become more like France because its workers are 'more productive', shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna said.

The rising Labour star said British workers took five days to what the French did in four.

Mr Umunna's remarks come just days after a leading investment bank warned that the British economy under Labour would 'look increasingly like France', where growth is almost non-existent

But, Mr Umunna told the Today programme on BBC Radio 4: 'The issue isn't just that we have more employment but the nature of the work.

'Too much of our work is low paid, it isn't secure, we don't have high skilled jobs. We have got to deal with the productivity problem in this country.

'It takes on average a British worker to Friday to do what equivalent workers in Germany and France will complete by the end of Thursday afternoon.

'The way we deal with that is ensuring people have more skills. They are actually more productive than us.

'People can say what they want about France but ultimately coming back to the UK we have got to be more productive.'

Mr Umunna was speaking this morning ahead of a major speech on Labour's plans for the economy by Ed Miliband.

A spokesman for the Labour shadow minister insisted he was not suggesting Britain should copy the French economic model.

He said: 'Chuka was simply making the observation that despite our many strengths, compared with other major European economies Britain lags behind our competitors on productivity. 

'That’s why today Labour is launching its better plan for prosperity to boost the number of better-paid, high skilled jobs.'

But Mr Umunna's remarks come just days after the Bank of America  suggested that Labour's economic plans could lead to lower growth and seriously damage investor confidence in the UK.

In a devastating assessment, it said: 'A Left-wing coalition around Labour, would, in our view, continue to deliver on fiscal austerity, albeit a milder version than the Tories, with the accompanying cyclical headwind that this entails, while embarking on structural changes which could in the medium run reduce the appeal of the UK as a business location and trigger, ultimately, a deterioration in potential GDP growth.'

It added: 'In a nutshell, the UK would look increasingly like France.'

The warning is acutely embarrassing for Mr Miliband, who cosied up to France's socialist President Francois Hollande after his 2012 victory.

At the time, Mr Miliband said the two men were 'in agreement' on the economy, and suggested he was looking to replicate the French anti-austerity programme.

Mr Hollande's policies, including a 75 per cent top tax rate, have proved a disaster.

French president Francois Hollande has seen his popularity plummet as the economy has stalled

Economic growth in the final quarter was 0.1 per cent in France, compared with 0.5 per cent in the UK. Unemployment is 9.9 per cent – way above the 5.8 per cent in the UK.

The BAML report warned that Mr Miliband is likely to 'seriously interfere with the private sector', adding that, with the public finances still in a mess, Labour may revert to bashing business in order to fund its pledges.

'If a centre-Left government cannot tackle inequality through social transfers, it will be tempted to focus on fighting 'primary inequality', for instance by imposing a massive increase in the minimum wage,' said the report. 'In our estimates, Labour's pledge to bring this to £8 per hour would put the UK at the level where France is, in terms of distance from the median wage.

'Re-regulation of working contracts and working time would also be likely. The 'energy price freeze' – mooted by Labour last year – and the proposals to introduce a market share cap in the banking sector are other examples of interference with the private sector.'

Conservative Party Chairman Grant Shapps said the report underlined the threat posed by Labour.

'Labour have no plan for the economy, other than more spending, more borrowing and more taxes,' he said. 'The choice is clear – between a competent Conservative government working through its long-term economic plan and the chaos of Labour with Ed Miliband and Ed Balls.'
