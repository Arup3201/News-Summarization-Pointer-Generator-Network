Unable to comment: Barclays chief Antony Jenkins

Barclays is being investigated for rigging the ‘Wild West’ foreign currency market, in yet another blow to its reputation.

Regulators are looking into allegations that traders at banks across the world conspired to manipulate the £3trillion-a-day market by rigging benchmark rates used when buying and selling currencies.

Barclays confirmed it is reviewing its trading going back several years as part of the international inquiry.

Chief executive Antony Jenkins, who took the helm 14 months ago after the bank was fined £290million for rigging Libor interest rates – used for inter-bank loans – said he was unable to comment on the ‘ongoing discussions’.

‘From time to time these legacy issues will arise and will have to be dealt with,’ he said.

‘We are in the process of changing the culture of Barclays. I’ve said it will take five to ten years to deeply embed that cultural change, and we are on track.’

The news comes as Barclays revealed a slump at its ‘casino’ bank – the investment arm – helped drag down profits by 26 per cent to £1.4billion in the three months to the end of September.

Chris Leslie, Labour’s shadow Treasury minister, said yesterday it would be a ‘devastating blow’ if more wrongdoing is discovered at the High Street giant.

‘Massive damage was done to the reputation of the UK financial services sector with Libor manipulation,’ he said. ‘It would be a devastating blow if Barclays is found to have been engaged in more scurrilous behaviour.’

Barclays becomes just the latest lender to be dragged into the deepening investigation, which began in the summer. Whistleblowers likened the unregulated foreign exchange rate market to the ‘Wild West’.

Banks buy and sell foreign currency on behalf of clients but traders can also bet on whether a currency will move up or down in value.

Accusations: Barclays traders are being accused of conspiring to manipulate the foreign currency market by rigging benchmark rates used when buying and selling

Regulators in the United States, Asia and Europe suspect that traders have manipulated benchmark currency rates so they can rig their own bets.

The investigation centres on claims that bank staff are making foreign currency trades before processing customers’ orders.

This week it emerged that a senior currency trader at emerging markets specialist Standard Chartered, formerly employed at Barclays and then Swiss bank UBS, had been suspended.

It is not thought the suspension is linked to the trader’s work at Standard Chartered.

Royal Bank of Scotland, UBS and Deutsche Bank have all confirmed they are being investigated.

But the news that regulators have turned their attention to Barclays comes as another setback for the bank. Efforts by Mr Jenkins to overhaul its tarnished image have been hampered by a series of scandals.

The bank is currently fighting a £270million fine in the US for manipulating energy prices and is being investigated by regulators on both sides of the Atlantic for rigging a number of benchmark rates.

The lender confirmed yesterday that it is appealing against a £50million fine imposed by City watchdog the Financial Conduct Authority over fees paid to Qatar investors during two emergency fund-raisings in 2008.

Barclays was forced to go cap in hand to shareholders earlier this month to bolster its capital this month, raising £5.8billion.

It had fallen foul of safety standards set by the Bank of England’s watchdog, the Prudential Regulation Authority, governing the amount of capital it has to hold.

And earlier this year an independent report headed by veteran lawyer Anthony Salz, commissioned in the wake of the fine imposed in the Libor scandal, criticised its practices.

Barclays’ investments bankers were branded arrogant for fostering a ‘win at all costs’ culture and deserting its values in the relentless pursuit of growth.

Earlier this month Barclays announced that Hector Sants, the former boss of defunct City watchdog the Financial Services Authority, was taking time off from his new role at the bank.

Mr Sants, who was said to be suffering from ‘stress and exhaustion’ was brought in as compliance chief to improve the bank’s reputation.

There was some good news for Barclays yesterday. It said it did not need to set aside more money to compensate customers missold payment protection insurance.

It has racked up a £4billion bill for the scandal so far.
