Shane Watson sent a scare through the Australian camp when he was hit on the helmet in the MCG nets while preparing for the Boxing Day Test.

All-rounder Watson was struck by a short-pitched delivery from bowler James Pattinson on Tuesday morning and left the nets to receive treatment.

A Cricket Australia spokesperson said the dazed Watson was shaken but otherwise okay.

Watson was pictured shaken up and holding his head after removing his helmet and was attended to by team doctors.

The ball sent a scare through training after the death of former teammate Phillip Hughes last month from a bouncer during a match

Former Australian teammate Phillip Hughes died last month after being hit on the back of a head from a bouncer during a first-class match in Sydney.

In a lively session, bowler Mitchell Starc also required treatment after being hit on the knee while batting and limping away from the session.

Opener David Warner was a notable absentee from the nets, watching on with his injured thumb, but he is still expected to play when the third Test against India gets under way on Friday.

Australia leads 2-0 in what has been an emotional series, marked by several tributes to the late Hughes from players on both sides - particularly from close friends Michael Clarke and Dave Warner.
