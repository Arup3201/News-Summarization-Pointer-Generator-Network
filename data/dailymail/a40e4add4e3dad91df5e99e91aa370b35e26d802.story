The leader of Romania's top SWAT team has embarrassed his bosses after nude photographs of him during a training exercise leaked to the press.

The elite team's commissioner-in-chief Emanoil Moraru is seen wearing nothing but a black wig, and a toy gun to cover his modesty, as officers in full protective gear surround him.

The photos have caused enormous embarrassment to senior management, but FBI trained Commissioner Moraru is unrepentant.

Mucking about: Naked cop Emanoil Moraru, commander-in-chief of the Romanian Special Operations Forces said it was all just a big joke among his 'gladiators'

Refusing to apologise, Commissioner Moraru said: ‘In my squad we are gladiators and we're a bit more crazy.’

‘The pictures were taken after a training session. We're not ashamed. We work hard and we train hard and sometimes we let off steam.

‘That gun is just a toy and the wig 
was from one of the training dummies. I'm actually wearing some pants 
but you can't see them in the picture,' he added.

But this is not the first time Commissioner Moraru, who was trained by the FBI in hostage and terrorist negotiations, has played tricks on his colleagues in Constanta, eastern Romania.

The cheeky commissioner-in-chief once went to work dressed as a 
binman and on another occasion he dressed up as a plant - and sat quietly in a corner until someone discovered him. A lesson in disguise.

A colleague said: ‘He is a good professional who likes to have fun. You don’t get to be the head of special operations for nothing.

‘But I must admit, sometimes his antics do raise eyebrows.

‘When he came to work dressed up as a 
plant it was pretty bizarre - especially as he just sat in a corner of 
the squad room waiting to see if anyone noticed him.’

Despite his antics Moraru has a fearsome 
reputation among criminals and colleagues say he is ruthless in his pursuit of justice.

‘When he gets on the trail of a criminal, he won’t stop until he has them behind bars,’ said one officer.

‘He likes to work hard and play hard. That’s the way he is,’ the colleague added.

Commissioner Moraru is also 
president of the National Policemen Body and holds the title of Honorary
Citizen of Constanta for his work with the community.
