He was arguably the most recognisable face of the cult classic Star Trek film series.

So when Leonard Nimoy died at his Bel Air, Los Angeles home on Friday, aged 83, following a long battle with lung disease on Friday, the outpouring of grief was constant.

And so it is only right we take a look at some of his best moments as Mr Spock in Star Trek. 

William Shatner (pictured left as Captain Kirk in the original series) paid an emotional tribute to former Star Trek co-star and friend Nimoy (right), saying he 'loved him like a brother'

Although Leonard Nimoy followed his 1966-69 Star Trek run with a notable career as both an actor and director, in the public's mind he would always be Spock.

He earned three Emmy Awards for the role, meaning he could land almost any television or movie role he wanted.

But Nimoy's ambivalence to the role was reflected in the titles of his two autobiographies, 'I Am Not Spock' (1975) and 'I Am Spock' (1995).

His half-human, half-Vulcan character was the calm counterpoint to William Shatner's often-emotional Captain Kirk on one of television and film's most revered cult series.

Nimoy, a Boston native, had been in and out of hospitals multiple times over recent months, following his announcement that he suffered from the potentially fatal lung disease.

He took to Twitter in 2014 to share his diagnosis, and gave his followers some advice, saying: 'I quit smoking 30 years ago. Not soon enough. I have COPD. Grandpa says, quit now!! LLAP [Live Long and Prosper]'.

On January 28, his declining health became increasingly evident when he was pictured being whisked through a New York airport in a wheelchair following a trip to the Caribbean.

He was first cast in the role in 1966 and starred in the series until 1969. He then appeared in eight subsequent feature films and a number of spin-offs

The former science fiction star was an avid user of social media and used it frequently until just days before his death.

His last message to fans on Twitter posted on Monday read: 'A life is like a garden. Perfect moments can be had, but not preserved, except in memory. LLAP'
