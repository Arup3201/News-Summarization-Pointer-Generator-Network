An extremely rare £1 coin dating back to the start of English Civil War is expected to fetch £50,000 at auction.

The solid silver 1643 Declaration Pound was struck in Oxford, which was Charles I's seat of power after he withdrew from London.

Charles was beheaded just six years after the coin was created, but an inscription on the back declares the King's belief that he could not be toppled.

The coin was made as the a new mint was set up in the city and was created to launch an official currency for parts of the country under the King's command.

The legend on the back of the coin translates as 'Let God arise and let His enemies be scattered', symbolising the King's belief in the 'absolute monarch'.

The words were a declaration of the King's power, but this belief in an almighty monarchy caused some of the tensions which led to the Civil War between the Royalist Cavaliers and the Parliamentarian Roundheads.

The  large coin, which is more two inches across and remains in good condition, was passed down through one family for generations but the current owner did not realise its value. 

Timothy Medhurst, a coin specialist and auctioneer at Duke's Auctioneers in Dorchester, Dorset, where the coin will be sold, said it was the type of item he dreams of finding.

'This coin marked Charles I's attempts to regain his failing power and it represents a pivotal moment in the history of the British Isles,' he said.

'It is a coin which is rare to find and it will cause a stir in the coin collecting world.

'The value of coins from this period are at an all-time high, and it will be highly sought after.

'The coin has been handed down through several generations to the current owner, who had no idea of its value and is as excited about the auction as I am.

'It is fair to say that 1643 was a crucial year in the history of the Civil War and it is fascinating to think that this coin was produced by hand, in silver, at such a tumultuous time.

'It was only six years after this coin was struck that Charles I was beheaded and labelled as "tyrant, traitor, murderer and public enemy" by the 59 judges who found him guilty of high treason.'

The English Civil War (1642-1651) was a series of armed conflicts and political machinations between the Roundheads and Cavaliers in the Kingdom of England.

It led to Charles I being beheaded and his son being exiled in 1649 as the monarchy was replaced by a protectorate, led by Oliver Cromwell.

After Cromwell's death, his son Richard was unable to maintain the confidence of the New Model Army, causing the protectorate to fall and the monarchy to be restored with Charles II on the throne in 1660. 

The sale takes place on March 12.
