Steve Bruce is hoping to complete the signing of left-back Andrew Robertson by tonight, so that he can be included in Hull's Europa League squad.

Hull and Dundee agreed a fee for the player, thought to be £3m, last night but Robertson and the club are yet to agree on personal terms.

Steve Bruce has to name his squad for the Thursday's Europa League match against Slovakian side Trencin by midnight tonight.

The match, which will be Steve Bruce's 100th in charge of the club, is the first time Hull City have ever played in Europe.

The Tigers earned their place in the Europa League after losing in the final of the FA Cup to Arsenal.

The FA Cup winners are awarded a place in the competition but as Arsenal had already ensured their participation in the Champions League that honour passed to Steve Bruce's men.
