A former state trooper has returned to court today to plead not guilty for the third time in the murders of his wife and two young children.

David Camm, an ex-law enforcement officer from Indiana, is charged with shooting dead his wife, seven-year-old son and daughter, five, in 2000 in a car at their Georgetown home.

The 49-year-old has always insisted that he is innocent of the brutal slayings. He was found guilty in 2002 and 2006 but both convictions were overturned on appeal.

Third round: David Camm, pictured in August, appeared in court today for the beginning of his third trial over the murders of his wife and children in 2000

The convictions were overturned after it was decided that the court had allowed inadmissible evidence regarding the former officer's alleged affairs and accusations he abused his daughter.

In 2005, DNA on a sweatshirt from the scene was tied to Charles Boney who had done time for burglary. He was convicted on three counts of murder and sentenced to 225 years.

The former state trooper has spent a majority of the past 13 years behind bars.

The Camm slayings are one of Indiana’s 
longest-running murder cases, following a tangled legal path riddled 
with missing murder weapons, allegations of affairs and child abuse, the
emergence of a second suspect and a prosecutor’s removal over a book 
deal.

Jury selection began in August with 
prosecution and defense weeding out people with prejudice over either 
Camm's guilt or innocence.

The trial was moved to Boone County in 
hopes that an impartial jury could be found. The slayings occurred more 
than 100 miles away at the family's Georgetown home.

Camm insists he was wrongly convicted, and this trial is another chance to clear his name. For Frank and Janice Renn, Kimberly Camm's parents, this is another shot at closure.

'It’s like that movie Groundhog Day, where he keeps waking up to the same thing every day,’ Mr Renn said.

For years, a debate has raged over 
whether Camm is a villain or a victim, with both sides taking to 
websites, books and national television to argue their points.

A petition on change.org seeking to have him freed has collected hundreds of signatures.

Another challenge for prosecutors is making a legal argument that resonates with jurors after the two previous failures.

Camm,
who had left the state police four months before his family was killed,
was arrested a few days after telling investigators he had discovered 
his wife and their two children shot to death in the garage of their 
Georgetown home September 8, 2000. The weapon was never found.

Defense
attorneys argued at Camm’s first trial in 2002 that prosecutors ignored
evidence that another man had been in the garage where killings 
occurred.

After DNA 
linked a violent ex-convict to the scene, they thought Camm would be 
freed. Instead, prosecutors said Camm had conspired with the second man 
to kill his family, and he was convicted again in 2006.

The second man, Boney, is serving a 225-year prison sentence for murder and conspiracy to commit murder.

Boney’s palm print was found on Kimberly Camm’s SUV, and a sweatshirt found in the garage had been issued to Boney in prison while he was serving time for armed robbery and criminal confinement.

Both times, appellate courts ruled that prosecutors had deliberately inflamed the jury, in the first trial by calling a dozen women who testified they had extramarital affairs with Camm, and in the second by suggesting he had molested his daughter without any evidence to back up those statements.

The third trial is expected to last at least six weeks amid heightened security at the Boone County Courthouse, about 25 miles northwest of Indianapolis. 

Floyd County Prosecutor Keith Henderson, who won the second murder conviction against Camm, won’t be there. He was removed after signing a book deal regarding Camm’s case, though he said the deal later was dropped.

The Renns plan to be in court, hoping for closure and a chance to heal.

‘Hopefully one day we'll wake up and this will never have happened. But common sense tells you it won’t be that way,’ Mr Renn said.

Resting place: The grave site of Kimberly Camm and her two young children, Brad and Jill

Both David Camm and Kimberly Renn were born and raised in New Albany, Indiana. The two met in 1988 and got married a year later - three years after Camm had divorced his first wife.

Also in 1989, David Camm was accepted into the Indiana State Police as a trooper recruit. The young couple had their first child, Bradley, in 1993, followed by Jill in 1995.

According to some accounts, the Camms' relationship took a turn for the worse shortly after the birth of their son, with the husband allegedly starting an affair with another woman, which culminated with him briefly moving out of the house.

By the time their daughter was born, however, the Camms’ life appeared to be back on track. The family finished construction on their new house on Lockhart Road in Georgetown, and things were seemingly going well, with David Camm serving as a state trooper with the Indiana State Police Sellesburg District, and his wife advancing her career as a well-paid financial analyst.

In March 2000, about four months before the killings, Dave resigned from his post with the state police and went to work for his uncle, who owned a basement waterproofing business.

September 28, 2000, began like most 
days in the Camm household, with Kimberly waking up at 6am, followed by 
David and their kids a short time later. 

The
husband kissed his family goodbye and left for work. About an hour 
later, Mrs Camm headed out with the children, dropping off Bradley at 
his elementary school and Jill at her pre-school.

After
making arrangements with her parents to stop by later in the day, 
Kimberly Camm drove to her work at Capital Holding Insurance Company. At
around 4pm, she left to pick up her daughter from school and take her 
to dance practice.

After
6pm, Kimberly took her son to his swimming practice at New Albany High 
School. Shortly after 7pm, the Camms set out for home, located about 11 
miles away.

Meanwhile, 
David Camm left work just before 7pm and drove to a nearby church, where
he arranged to play a pickup game of basketball with a group of 
friends. 

Costly case: It is estimated that by the time Camm's third trial reaches its conclusion, the state will have spent $4million in taxpayers' money on the case

Just before 9.30pm, Dave Camm placed a frantic call with the ISP Sellersburg, where he had worked for 10 years, reporting that he found his wife and children shot dead in the garage of their home.

The prosecution, however, rejected David Camm’s version of events, accusing him of murdering his family in order to pursue affairs with other women. 

During his first trial, the 11 people who took part in the basketball pickup game on the night of September 28 testified in Camm's defense, telling jurors that he was at the gym at the time of the murders.

But the prosecutors claimed that Camm could have sneaked out to meet up with ex-convict Charles Boney and kill his family.

Camm was convicted the first time in 2002, but the verdict was thrown out two years later, the Indianapolis Star reported.

He was found guilty a second time in 2006 - a conviction that was also overturned on appeal in 2009, when the Indiana Supreme Court ruled that prosecutors inflamed the jury by making baseless accusations that Camm had molested his daughter.

It is estimated that by the time Camm's third trial reaches its conclusion, the state will have spent $4million in taxpayers' money on the case.
