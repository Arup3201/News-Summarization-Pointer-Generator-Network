David Luiz has admitted that the arrivals of Diego Costa and Cesc Fabregas have made his former team Chelsea 'better' since his departure to Paris Saint Germain.

The Brazil defender became a cult hero during his three-and-a-half year spell at Stamford Bridge before leaving for Ligue 1 in a £50million deal last summer.

Luiz is set to face his ex-team-mates when both sides meet in the Champions League last 16 later this month, with the 27-year-old conceding the Blues are in fine fettle. Speaking to French radio station RMC, Luiz said: 'Yes, Chelsea are better this season.

'Above all, they are better balanced following the arrival of Fabregas. He's perhaps the player they were missing: he balances the midfield, makes the team play well and knows how to hold on to the ball from time-to-time.

'With the arrival of Diego Costa -- a warrior forward who always wants to score and challenge defenders -- and the continuity provided by Mourinho in the dugout, it's logical Chelsea are stronger this season.'

Chelsea defeated the big spending French side at the quarter-final stage of the competition last season - despite Luiz scoring an own goal in the first leg - and will be favourites to progress again this term.

'PSG's elimination last year was tough, because it came down to away goals. We'll have to play to our strengths: going forward, playing to win. I have faith in my team. 

'We know Chelsea are an experienced team that has already won the Champions League. They are used to this, and they knocked out PSG last year.

'But we mustn't think about that too much. We have to show and up our level, and play to all our strengths on the pitch.'

The big-haired Brazilian also dismissed claims that he has a fractured relationship with Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho who suggested Luiz would not be overly missed in west London.

'I still have a good relationship with him. Mourinho is someone who works in the same way with all his players, without making any difference between them. 

'People have tried to find a problem between Jose and me, but that problem has never existed,' said Luiz.

'I think I took the right decision. I had come to the end of the road with Chelsea, and I chose to come here, to Paris. I found a team that gives me a lot of satisfaction. And I hope to continue playing well to take Paris as far as possible.'
