The father whose fateful decision to allow his 9-year-old daughter try out a powerful Uzi sub-machine gun led to her killing her instructor  is an investment fund manager, MailOnline can reveal.

Alex Gen MacLachlan is an Ivy League-educated banker who manages a fund worth $1.5bn. He and his wife Alison have made no public comment on the tragedy beyond to say through their lawyer that they are 'devastated' by the accident at the Arizona firing range which killed instructor Charles Vacca.

A female relative of MacLachlan living in New Jersey confirmed to MailOnline that Alex's daughter had been involved in the shooting. 'But I can't say anything about it,' she added. 'It's just terrible.'

'All right, full auto': MacLachlan's wife, Alison, filmed the moment their daughter shot dead instructor Charles Vacca and handed it over to police. The family said in a statement that they were praying for Vacca's family

He has not returned to work at Dixon's Global Resource Masters Fund since the August 25 accident. The family hasn't yet returned to their home in Weehawken, New Jersey just across the Hudson River from New York City either.

A neighbor on the busy street where the MacLachlans live described the family as 'quiet and very nice,' adding 'it's all so terrible. That girl's just a baby.' 

MacLachlan, 43, is a high-flyer in the financial world. After graduating from Cornell University and getting a masters at Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania, he spent most of his career in Australia where he also worked for UBS.

It is believed his wife is Australian and that his daughter was born there before the family returned to the United States last year. 

Neighbours at the upscale Sydney suburb where they lived described them as a 'gorgeous, happy family', adding the couple had two other children, an older boy and a girl of high school age.

MacLachlan has hired lawyer Kevin Walsh - who has been named as one of the 'Best Lawyers in America' since 2012 - to represent him.

Walsh, a former federal prosecutor, did not return MailOnline's repeated calls.

He earlier issued a statement saying the MacLachlan family was 'devastated', by the death of Vacca, 39, saying family members 'prayed day and night' that he would 'survive his injury'. 

Walsh said the MacLachlans 'continue to pray' for Vacca's family 'during this terribly difficult time'.

Alex and Alison MacLachlan and their three children were vacationing in Las Vegas and took a 60-mile shuttle across the Arizona border to the Last Stop resort in White Hills for some weapon practice on August 25. 

They went for an early morning monster truck ride before going to Last Stop's Burgers and Bullets shooting range. 

According to Mohave County Sheriff's Department, Alex was first to fire the Mini Uzi 9mm before allowing his little girl to have a go. 

Video shows Vacca telling the pony-tailed girl, who was wearing a gray t-shirt, pink shorts and sneakers, how to shoot the gun.

The cellphone video, taken by the girl's mother and released by the sheriff's department, shows the instructor, wearing sunglasses, a black t-shirt, camouflage pants and dark gloves, tapping the back of the girl's left knee to put her into a correct shooting stance. He then let her fire one shot as he braced her right elbow with his gloved right hand and placed his left hand in the small of her back. 

Vacca then turned the weapon on to automatic fire and that is when things went tragically wrong. He then says 'all right, full auto' and the video shows the slightly-built pre-teen lose control of the weapon which curls upward and to her left where her instructor is standing. 

The video cuts out before the shot to the head that kills Vacca.

The girl's parents did not initially realize what had happened as they rushed to their daughter, who had dropped the gun complaining that the recoil had hurt her shoulder.

Range workers went to the aid of Vacca, but nothing could be done to save him. A 911 call timed at 10.02 am recorded a fellow worker urging him: 'Breathe, breathe, breathe, Charlie. Breathe.' While another says 'I don't think he's gonna make it.'

A 911 dispatcher asks a caller: 'Is he breathing?' The desperate man replies: 'Yes he is, he's having convulsions. You need to send EMS right away.' In a second 911 call a few minutes later, a man at the range asks the dispatcher: 'Where the f..k is the helicopter?'

Vacca was eventually stabilized at the scene and airlifted by helicopter to University Medical Center in Las Vegas where he was pronounced dead soon after arrival.

Authorities are not pressing charges in the death. According to police reports, Alex and Alison MacLachlan refused to allow investigators to interview their children because they were 'going through a lot'.

Police at the scene were instructed to collect the waivers signed by the parents allowing the girl to shoot the Uzi but were told by range staff that they had 'blown away' after the shooting.

The MacLachlans have not said whether they are considering a civil suit against the shooting range owners.

Alex MacLachlan works for the US arm of Dixon Advisory, based in Sydney, Australia. His 10th floor office in Jersey City, New Jersey, has sweeping views of Manhattan and the Statue of Liberty across the Hudson River.

'Alex conceived the idea of establishing a business to acquire and manage homes in urban areas experiencing strong growth and gentrification in 2008,' according to the website of his employers, Dixon USA.

'Between 2008 and 2010, Alex researched and developed the investment thesis and business model for what would become Dixon USA, and in late 2010, Dixon USA was launched. Today, Dixon USA manages a portfolio of over $300 million and is the only real estate investment trust focused on New York metropolitan area single-family homes.'

A woman who answered the phone on Wednesday said MacLachlan had not been at work all week but referred other questions to MacLachlan's assistant, who refused to comment.

According to the company's website, 'from funds under management of under $100 million at the time of his start, Alex has grown the Funds Management division to over $1.5 billion of funds under management today.'

The Dixon website adds: 'In addition to his role as CEO of Funds Management, he now also leads the strategy and growth of Dixon USA, a leading provider of urban single-family home rentals in the New York metropolitan area.

'During his tenure in investment banking, Alex worked on more than $100 billion in mergers and acquisitions and capital markets transactions, advising some of the world’s leading companies,' the Dixon website says.
