David Moyes was in Spain on Friday night to hold talks with Real Sociedad about becoming the La Liga club’s next manager.

The former United boss was given a tour of the Basque side but is yet to decide whether to re-establish his career there.

Moyes, 51, has been out of work since April when his dream job to follow Sir Alex Ferguson at Manchester United was cut short after just 10 difficult months.

Now the man who was three times voted manager of the year by the LMA during more than a decade in charge at Goodison Park has to decide if he has found the right place to rebuild that reputation.

Real Sociedad, where Wales manager Chris Coleman was once in charge, have turned to him after a disastrous start to their La Liga campaign which has left them 19th in the table with just six points from 10 games.

But the potential at a club which gets regular gates of 24,000-plus and was in the Champions League a year ago could be enough to persuade Moyes he has found the right opportunity to start again.

He told Sportsmail recently: ‘I’d like to find a job, if I can, that gives me a chance of being successful.

‘I have always felt it could enhance me as a manager to go abroad, so that is a possibility.’
