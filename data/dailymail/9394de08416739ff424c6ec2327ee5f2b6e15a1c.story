Casey Kasem has been taken off life support and his doctors have begun focusing on making him comfortable instead of prolonging his life.

The announcement, from the 82-year-old American Top 40 host's daughter Kerri Kasem, comes after a lengthy legal battle over his care between his children from his first marriage and Jean, his current wife. Kasem is said to be suffering from dementia, Parkinson's disease and sepsis.

A judge ruled Wednesday that Kasem's doctors should stop force-feeding the dying broadcast legend and allow him to slip away - despite the legal and emotional objections of Jean, who declared 'You have blood on your hands!'

But Kasem's life will not end without even more legal drama. TMZ.com reports that Santa Monica police are investigating Jean for criminal elder abuse.

Health concerns: Hospital staff caring for Casey Kasem claim they warned his wife of the dangers of moving him

Kerri Kasem, Casey's daughter from his first marriage, filed a police report alleging that Jean's decision to remove Casey from a Santa Monica, California, nursing home last month were criminal - and that they could ultimately contribute to his death.

Kerri claims her step-mother took ailing Casey to Nevada, Arizona and then to Washington in an attempt to find a secret location to care for him and keep him away from his children.

Jean ultimately housed her ill husband in secret at a friend's home in Washington State outside Seattle - until Kerri tracked the couple down and won a court order allowing him to be taken to a hospital.

Kerri is claiming that in her step-mother's haste to spirit Casey away from the rest of his family and friends, he developed a bed sore that became infected.

Update: In a Facebook post Kerri Kasem announced that her father had been removed from life support

TMZ reports that Kerri says she has medical documents that show the bed sore will likely contribute to Kasem's death.

Kerri posted on her Facebook page that her father is now dying in a Washington state hospital.

'Transitioning our father’s treatment to comfort-oriented care was one of the hardest decisions we’ve ever had to make,' she wrote.

'For the last 11 days, our father has been surrounded day and night by love and care by his daughters Kerri and Julie, his son Mike, his brother Mouner and sister-in-law Mary, and his dear friend Gonzalo Venecia,' she added.
