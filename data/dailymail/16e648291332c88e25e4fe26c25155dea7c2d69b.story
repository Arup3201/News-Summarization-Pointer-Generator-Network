A toddler escaped uninjured after falling 10ft down a drain when a rusty manhole cover broke under his weight.

AJ Hayward, who is just 18 months old, hit his head on the side of the concrete culvert and narrowly missed being crushed by the iron cover which landed just inches away from him.

He was taken to hospital after the accident on Saturday night and was treated for suspected concussion before being released the next day.

Fortunately there was no water in the bottom of the drain because of the hot weather and the manhole cover narrowly missed him after it fell

The drama unfolded in front of his father, Arthur, 36, and mother Leanne Webb, 28, during a relative's birthday barbecue in Worcester.

Mr Hayward climbed down the drain, which did not have water in because of the hot weather, and lifted his son to safety.

He said: 'My son could have died, if that cast-iron cover had followed him down the hole it would have killed him. It fell to the side fortunately.

'I’ve been up all night at the hospital. The doctors can’t believe he went down the manhole. He was on one manhole cover and then he stepped on to the other one and the cover lid just went.

'As he stepped on it he just went straight through. I had to climb all the way down there and climb back up to the ladder with him on my arm.

'He hit his head on the steps as he went down. I’m still in shock. Every time I close my eyes I can see him falling.'

Mrs Hayward added: 'We were just talking here, we were watching him he was singing and walking around there humming to himself.

The drain cover was repaired by workers from Worcestershire County Council

'He trod on the first one and then he walked across on that one and he just disappeared. He was gone. I haven’t slept all night since it happened, we’re just traumatised.'

Worcestershire County Council, which is responsible for the drains, said they had repaired the manhole cover which belonged to Severn Trent Water.

Highways manager Jon Fraser said: 'As soon as we were made aware of the incident we promptly attended the location to make the area safe by fitting a utility plate to cover the manhole and put barriers around the area.

'It’s a Severn Trent Water manhole cover and this will be referred to them.'

A spokesman for Severn Trent Water said: 'We are aware of an incident that took place at Troutbeck Drive that was reported to use this morning [Monday].

'We take safety very seriously and we would like to apologise to those affected. We sent an inspector out to investigate this morning and the site has now been made safe.'
