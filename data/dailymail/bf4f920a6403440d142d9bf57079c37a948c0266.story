Nineteen children were among 46 people killed in a devastating landslide that swept through a mountain village in China.

Mud and rocks smothered 16 homes in the village of Zhaojiagou area of Gaopo Village, in the south of the country, which has a population of just 468 and 73 households.

Rescuers dressed in orange jumpsuits faced the grim task of pulling the dead from underneath debris and had to use heavy machinery to sift through mud and soil.

Grim: Dead bodies lie covered with sheets at the scene of a devastating landslide in Gaopo, Zhenxiong County, Yunnan, China, which killed 46 people.

Tragic: Rescuers carry the body of a victim after the landslide in a mountainous region in southwest China's Yunnan Province

Vigil: The devastating natural disaster killed 19 children. Tents were put up to house residents whose homes were swept away

On Saturday, the state-run China Central Television said the bodies of all victims had been recovered after a 700-strong emergency team used joined the rescue effort.

The Zhenxiong government said in a statement the mudslide was caused by soil that had become heavily saturated from continuous rain and snow over the past month.

There were other factors, including the slope's steepness, its poor soil composition and the impact from an earthquake, the government said.

A 700-strong team joined efforts to try and find survivors but all those missing have now been confirmed dead

The village, in the south of the country, has seen almost constant rain for a month. It is believed this was the main factor in the disaster

Rescuers had to use an escavator to sift through the mud and soil in order to find the dead

The statement denied any direct relation between the disaster and mining activities in the area and concluded that the mudslide was a natural disaster

Mudslides occur periodically in the 
region, which is prone to earthquakes and heavy rains. In a nearby 
county, 81 people died in an earthquake in September. A month later, a 
landslide buried a primary school, killing 18 students and one other 
person.
