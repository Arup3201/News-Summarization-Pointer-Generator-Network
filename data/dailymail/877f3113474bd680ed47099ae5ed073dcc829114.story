He’s famed for being one of the greatest living singer songwriters and now Sir Paul McCartney has turned his hand to rapping.

The former Beatle – a passionate vegetarian – recorded the rap video in an attempt to persuade people to stop eating meat one day a week in an effort to reduce their carbon footprint and help fight climate change.

The 51-second video begins with a simple message directing people to pledge their support to the Meat-Free Monday petition.

The former Beatle - a passionate vegetarian - recorded the rap video in an attempt to persuade people to stop eating meat one day a week

The 51-second video begins with a simple message directing people to pledge their support to the Meat-Free Monday petition

But it quickly descends into a cringeworthy performance as the Beatles singer starts to wave his hands and click his fingers

But it quickly descends into ‘Dad-rap’ territory as he begins to put on an accent along with animated hand gestures, finger-clicks and hand claps.

Sir Paul, 72, made the plea for people to go vegetarian once a week before the UN climate summit, which takes place today in New York.

In the video – which runs under the hashtag ‘#MFMclimatepledge’ - he says: ‘I need your help, all I want you to do is just log in on pledge.meatfreemondays.com and pledge your support to the idea of meat-free Monday.

‘I need your help - please do it. We’ll send all these pledges to the politicians, and then they’ll do something about it.’

He then ends by repeatedly rapping the web address for the organisation in an accent, saying: ‘Pledge.meatfreemondays.com, pledge.meatfreemondays.com. You can do it right now please.’

Sir Paul has spoken out against the meat industry in the past which he says is a major contributor to climate change.

More than 843,000 people – including the likes as Gwyneth Paltrow, Mark Ruffalo, Kevin Spacey and Ricky Gervais – have signed up to the Meat-Free Monday pledge

The Meat-Free Monday movement stems from the idea that cutting out animal products from the human diet can reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

More than 843,000 people – including the likes of Gwyneth Paltrow, Mark Ruffalo, Kevin Spacey and Ricky Gervais – have signed up to the pledge.

UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon is gathering together global leaders at the UN climate change summit today- the first time Heads of State will have come together to discuss climate change since Copenhagen in 2009.

The summit is being held to jump-start the climate negotiations that are due to conclude with an ambitious global treaty in December 2015.
