It's the real life sister act! Meet the Harp Twins, the identical twin sisters who are causing a storm online by covering legendary rock songs using nothing but harps.

The sisters started making videos because they wanted to show their friends and family their incredible talent.

They spent weeks practicing and arranging their covers of rock legends including The Rolling Stones, AC/DC, Pink Floyd, Coldplay and Led Zeppelin.

When the songs went online they attracted a rock star-sized following, racking up millions of view.Â 

Their version of Led Zeppelin's Stairway to Heaven and their cover of the Game of Thrones theme on YouTube have had nearly two million hits each.

Camille said: 'We began playing harp in Middle School, after we had already been playing piano for years.

'Harp has always seemed like a magical instrument to us.

Many people assume we have been playing harp a lot longer.'

Passionate about music: The twins do all their own arrangements as they make popular songs into harp tunes

'We started arranging rock music as a fun alternative to our classical harp studies.

Later, we posted a couple of our covers on YouTube for family and friends and it went from there.'

When the renaissance rockers first started to learn the harp, they had to share a second hand one between them.

Our friends think our videos are fun - especially if they are fans of the original band.'
