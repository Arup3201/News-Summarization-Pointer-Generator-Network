Footage has emerged which shows the moment a police officer violently shoves a girl over a bench during riots in Arizona.

The video footage was captured during a riot by students from the University of Arizona after they lost to Wisconsin in Anaheim, California during the NCAA basketball tournament on Saturday.

Fans back home at the college's Tucson campus took to the streets in a disorderly display of disappointment.

The officer in riot gear appears from nowhere throwing the girl over the metal frame.

After tackling the girl to the ground the officer walks away but fails to arrest or restrain her for any offence.

The clip has appeared on YouTube and been watched nearly 50,000 times.

However, the online community has reacted angrily to the force used by the officer.

One commentator wrote: 'If you slow the YouTube down frame by frame you will see she does nothing. The blonde consoling her says they were trying to find a way around the crowd to get to their cars.'

Another added: 'She was just standing there, not attacking anyone. The little cop decided to pick on someone smaller than himself to show how big and bad he was, when in reality he looked like some Power Ranger figure.'

However, one person said: 'Perhaps... Just perhaps, she should not have walked TOWARDS the riot police.

'Honestly, if you're an officer and see someone coming up behind you and your fellow officers while a riot is taking place, you would be concerned too.

'Now, the officers force may have been much, but what if the girl had not been innocent? He would then be deemed a hero. Don't be too quick to judge.'

Meanwhile, another clip filmed on someone's phone during the riot shows a student standing up to police and taking pepper balls to the chest and abdomen when they tried to tackle him to the ground.

Police action: The rioters threw beer bottles and firecrackers at the responding officers

Photographer Andrew Brown, 32, witnessed the riots while going to check-in on his girlfriend who works at a local shop.

He said the mood was so light that several students were taking selfies on the street amid the riot, so he documented a few of the photos in action.

'Those pictures sum up the night,' Mr Brown told the New York Daily News. '(The rioting) wasn't anything nefarious. It was just college kids doing what they do.'

'They were excited they were getting that much attention,' he added.

Loss: Students clashed against Tucson Police officers on University Avenue Saturday

Tucson police Sgt Pete Dugan said crowds leaving bars and 
restaurants near campus after the game filled University Boulevard and 
wouldn't leave despite urging through a PA system and social media 
declaring it an unlawful assembly.

Police
 brought in cruisers and a unit of officers with batons, helmets and 
face masks to block the street when people started tossing beer bottles,
 cans and firecrackers, hitting police vehicles and endangering 
officers.Â 

Officers fired 
pepper spray, pepper canisters and pepper balls, which disperse into the
 air when they hit, Dugan said. No tear gas was used despite some 
reports.

Rounded up: 15 people were arrested in Saturday's riots, but only one person was taken to county jail

Not happy: The university issued a statement following the riots calling them 'disappointing'

A witness, David

with people taking photos, but then 'people got in cops' faces.'

He said
 fans were throwing drink cans at officers, whom he saw marching down 
University Boulevard.

In total, 15 people were arrested but only one person was booked at county jail.

The university issued a statement calling the riots 'disappointing'.
