Basic care: Patients are paying for private nurses as NHS staff are failing them

Private nurses are being hired to feed and wash elderly patients in NHS hospitals.

The patients, or their relatives, are spending up to £200 a day to ensure they receive basic nursing care that health service staff fail to provide.

This includes help to eat their meals, being washed, and being turned in bed to prevent painful sores.

The drafting in of private nurses has been described as a ‘terrible indictment of the NHS’.

And campaigners have pointed out that only a minority of patients will be able to afford such a service, meaning others on the same wards have no option but to put up with a sub-standard service.

The revelation comes just a month after a damning report revealed that the care of the elderly in many hospitals is so bad that it is breaking the law.

In one in five hospitals investigated by the Care Quality Commission, the care was so poor that patients were denied help with ‘the basics in life’ – eating, drinking and going to the lavatory.

In another probe highlighted by the Daily Mail’s Dignity for the Elderly campaign, nearly half of hospitals visited by undercover inspectors were failing to meet basic nutrition standards.

Elderly patients were routinely left without anything to drink for hours, with some so dehydrated they were put on drips. Now, some feel they have no option but to bring in their own nurse.

One private nurse, who has helped feed, wash and turn a patient in an NHS hospital in London, said ward nurses can seem so busy that patients feel guilty about asking them for help.

Angela Hamlin, founder of Draycott Nursing and Care Agency in central London, and a former deputy matron, said relatives were paying for private help because they were afraid of meals being whisked away before they were eaten.

Miss Hamlin, who has supplied around eight nurses to NHS patients in the past two years, said the private staff from her agency would typically already be helping the patient at home, then continue to assist them if they were admitted to hospital.

She said the nurses on the wards seemed more interested in filling  in paperwork than comforting patients: ‘You don’t see nurses just being with someone, which is often what the patient wants, they have always got something else to do.’

Some hospitals have refused to allow patients to engage private nurses, while others have agreed as long as they do not give any medical care, such as injections.

Extra support: One agency has seen about eight cases where patients have sought carers while they were in NHS hospitals

The Patients Association says it has been told of eight cases in the past six months alone, describing it as a new phenomenon fuelled by worries about poor nursing care.

Katherine Murphy, the charity’s chief executive and a former nurse, said it was through carrying out basic tasks such as feeding and washing that nurses became aware of changes in a patient’s medical condition.

She said: ‘If patients have to go to the extreme of taking their own carers into what is meant to be a caring environment, it shows a total lack of trust in the NHS.

‘It is a terrible indictment of the NHS if people even need to consider that they have to have someone there to provide the level of care which is their right.’

Joyce Robins of campaign group Patient Concern described the situation as ‘pretty horrendous’.

She added: ‘It is the way people are going to be forced to go if they want to come out fed and watered.’

Andy Burnham, the shadow health secretary, called on ministers to ‘get a grip’ on ensuring adequate staffing and making the basics of nursing care a top priority for hospital staff.

The Department of Health said: ‘We expect all hospitals to make sure that they are providing safe, high-quality nursing care because this must be at the heart of the NHS.’
