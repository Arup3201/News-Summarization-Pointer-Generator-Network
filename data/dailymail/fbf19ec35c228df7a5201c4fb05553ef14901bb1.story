A rural sports event which is 300 years older than the modern Olympic Games took place in Gloucestershire, with the highlight of the festival shin kicking.

The Cotswold Olimpicks, which were first held in 1612 near Chipping Campden, took place for the 402nd time yesterday featuring a range of medieval sports.

The top attraction of shin kicking has been taking place at the Games since they began and sees the competitors use straw as shin guards as they try to bring their opponents to the ground.

Other sports at the event include tug of war, throwing the hammer and a five mile race as well as a Champion of the Hill tournament, a four event sport which includes a static jump, a hammer throw, throwing a shot put and spurning the barre, an English version of tossing the caber.

The Games have been held every year since 1966 after they were revived in 1951, and attract thousands of visitors.

They are always held on the Friday following the Spring Bank Holiday and after dusk, a bonfire is light in Chipping Campden and a torchlight procession takes place.

The event sees the competitors hold on to each others shoulders as they kick shins, trying to make their opponent fall over

The competitor on the left almost makes his opponent fall to the floor as they battle it out in the hugely popular event

People taking part are not allowed to wear steel toe cap boots and must wear a traditional white smock

The only protection competitors are allowed is straw, and many stuff it up their trouser legs to guard their shins

It is thought that the modern Olympic movement has its roots in the small rural event, which takes place in Gloucestershire

A sack race, left, and a wheelbarrow race, right, which is part of the Champion of the Hill event are contested at the Games. The Champion of the Hill consists of disciplines such as a static jump, a hammer throw and throwing a shot put

As night falls, the tug of war begins. The event is one of the medieval sports that still make up the Cotswold Olimpicks

The Games are always held on the Friday following the Spring Bank Holiday in May
