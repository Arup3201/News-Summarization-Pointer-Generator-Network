A girl born with one ear is being denied a hearing aid for her first day of school because of where she lives.

Ellie Sanders, four, was born with a rare condition called hemifacial microsomia which affects the development of the lower half of the face.

It left her with just one functioning ear, meaning she desperately needs a special device to allow her to hear her teachers clearly on her first day of school in September.

Ellie Sanders, (pictured with mother, Kelly) 4, was born without a right ear and has hearing loss meaning she will struggle to hear her teachers when she starts school in September

Her mother Kelly, 31, applied for the bone anchored hearing aid implant (Baha) which transmits sound directly through the skull and reaches the inner ear.

But she says Ellie is the victim of a ‘postcode lottery’ with two NHS trusts arguing about who should pay the £3,000 bill.

While other children elsewhere in Britain get the aid Ellie, from Truro, Cornwall, faces starting school without one.

Ms Sanders said: ‘Other families in the same situation elsewhere in the UK have been offered a Baha. They don't have to go crawling around to other trusts.

Ms Saunders asked NHS Kernow to provide the £3,000 bone anchored hearing aid that Ellie needs but the Trust referred her to NHS England which has also failed to help

‘I don't know how long this process is going to take. It's just so unclear where we stand, whereas other people seem to have great support.

‘Ellie struggles now in a nursery setting. We have become more concerned with her affected side and how she will cope with starting school in September, but they seem to be passing the buck.’

Ms Sanders first tried unsuccessfully to get a Baha from the former Cornwall and Isles of Scilly Primary Care Trust which later became NHS Kernow.

When she asked NHS Kernow for the device she was told she couldn't have one and was instead directed to NHS England, which has also failed to deliver.

After endless consultations and letters Ms Sanders now fears the vital aid will not reach her daughter before she starts school.

A spokesman for NHS Kernow said: ‘This particular type of equipment is funded by NHS England. We have written to the consultant caring for Ellie to advise him of this.’

NHS England refused to comment on individual cases but a spokesman said: ‘From April 1, 2013 there was a new national commissioning policy in place providing guidance on bone anchored hearing aids for hearing loss.

‘This now ensures patients have the same access to treatment irrespective of where they live in the country.’

Hemifacial microsomia is a condition which causes the tissue on one side of the face to be underdeveloped.

It is a congenital disorder and it affects one in 3,500 to 4,500 children and is the second most common facial birth defect after clefts.

It is believed to result from a developmental problem in the early stages of pregnancy and the level of deformity varies significantly, as does the area of the face affected.

It is most common for the ear, side of the skull, cheek tissue, jaw, teeth or facial nerves to be affected. The main form of treatment is reconstructive surgery.
