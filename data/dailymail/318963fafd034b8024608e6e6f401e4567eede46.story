Two sisters, who worked alongside each other as Roman Catholic nuns until they were in their nineties, died a day apart in their Menands home last week.

Sister Jean Marie Wheeler and Sister Elaine Wheeler both Daughters of Charity nuns died aged 98 and 96 on Thursday and Friday last week respectively.

The pair were two of seven sisters raised in the Bronx - five of them, including Sister Jean and Sister Elaine, became nuns.

Sisters to the end: Jean, left, died at the age of 98 on Thursday, a day before her sister and fellow nun Elaine, right. The nuns kept up their sibling bond meeting up for a bedtime chat every night

They will be remembered in a single funeral mass tomorrow.

Fellow sisters at Saint Louise House today recalled how their differences as much as their close relationship defined them.

'They were remarkable women, very different in their own ways, but also very close,' Sister Joanne Donovan, the head of Saint Louise House told the Times Union of Albany.

The sisters were both born in Chicago but were raised in New York as their family moved.

All five siblings who entered religious life stayed close - vacationing together in a small cottage beside the Daughters of Charity property.

Religious: The Wheeler family were devout Roman Catholics living in the Bronx. Five of the seven sisters became nuns - all working in the New York area

'They did everything together and if you met one Wheeler sister, you knew all the Wheeler sisters,' Donovan added.

The sisters weren't roommates at Saint Louise House but were inseparable beyond that.

They used to collect sweet treats to share before bedtime at 8pm, precious moments when they shared their sisterly bond.

Jean liked milk chocolate and Elaine preferred dark chocolate.

Sister Irene Brassard, who is Donovan's assistant, told the newspaper: 'They were big talkers, real chatterers,'

They were the last two of the Wheeler girls still alive and were both proud of the teaching work they carried out across New York.

Sister Elaine taught biology at Cardinal McCloskey High School in Albany from 1957 to 1978.

Former pupils remembered her for her kindness, according to the Times Union report.

She would secretly buy new clothing and shoes for poorer students.

Sister Jean taught at St John's Alternative Elementary School and St. John's in Brooklyn.

In recent years Sister Jean grew frailer, losing an eye in a car accident and becoming increasing deaf. 

Her younger sister continued to support her - sneaking cookies into her room at night.

After Sister Jean's death, the latest stash was discovered hidden in her room meant for her sister who had died the day before.
