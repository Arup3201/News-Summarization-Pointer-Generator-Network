Russian President Vladimir Putin has been accused of wanting to restore the Soviet Union after he sent 2,000 tonnes of humanitarian aid across the border into Ukraine. 

A convoy of 250 Russian army trucks, painted white, are heading towards the eastern Ukrainian city of Luhansk. 

The development prompted Ukrainian prime minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk that Putin's 'goal is to take the entire of Ukraine'.

The trucks left Russia overnight and arrived approached the disputed frontier shortly before dawn 

The convoy passes through the Ukrainian border at Izvarino without being inspected by customs officers

He added: 'He [Putin] cannot cope with the idea that Ukraine would be a part of a big EU family. He wants to restore the Soviet Union,' Yatsenyuk said.

The Russian emergency ministry, which coordinated previous humanitarian aid deliveries to Ukraine, could not be reached for comment about the convoy.

Colonel Andriy Lysenko, a spokesman for the Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council, told journalists Saturday that the convoy had crossed 'illegally' onto Ukrainian territory.

'Ukraine border guards and customs were not allowed to examine the cargo and vehicles. 

'Representatives of the Red Cross don't accompany the cargo, nobody knows what's inside.'

Colonel Lysenko's relatively mild comments on the second convoy and the silence of more senior Ukrainian officials shows how dramatically the mood has shifted in the Kiev government since August. 

President Petro Poroshenko has been at pains to prove that last week's cease-fire deal has yielded improvements on the ground in east Ukraine. 

On Friday, he lauded the deal, which has been riddled by violations since it was imposed last week, as a 'fragile but efficient peace process.'

In August, Ukrainian officials said that a first convoy of humanitarian aid from Russia would be seen as an invasion of the country, and loudly protested any attempts by Russia to unilaterally bring in the aid. 

Ukrainian officials fear that the convoy would have been carrying military equipment instead of food 

Russian officials claimed the aid was needed because of severe shortages in the eastern city of Lugansk

Workers unloaded an estimated 2,000 tonnes of 'humanitarian aid' according to Russian officials 

Eventually Russia sent its trucks across the border and into rebel-held territory without the oversight of the International Red Cross, contrary to an agreement signed between Ukraine and Russia.

A representative of the ICRC's Moscow office said they had not been informed about the current convoy, either.

Galina Balzamova of the ICRC said: 'We were not officially notified of an agreement between Moscow and Kiev to ship the cargo.'

Colonel Lysenko said that six Ukrainian servicemen had died since the truce. He also confirmed that 12 rebel fighters had been killed by Ukrainian forces near Sea of Azov city of Mariupol, where he said they were doing reconnaissance work - the first such admission that they have inflicted casualties on the rebel side since the cease-fire began.

In a statement posted online early Saturday, the Donetsk city council said that there had been fighting near the airport throughout the night. Two shells had hit residential buildings in the area but no casualties were reported.

Continuous rocket fire could be heard overnight in downtown Donetsk, and a column of three GRAD rocket launchers - all its rockets still in place - was seen moving freely through the rebel-held city on Saturday morning.

Yury Stepanov, a Russian official overseeing the convoy said the convoy consisted mainly of foodstuffs - rice, sugar, and canned fish and beef - but also included medicine, technical equipment and clothes. The deliveries were in closed boxes, small enough to be easily carried by one person, but rice was seen spilling from a broken bag. 

Stepanov said his team was responsible only for delivery, and distribution will be handled by local authorities - which for now means the separatist leaders of the self-proclaimed Luhansk People's Republic.

Gennady Tsepkalo, a senior separatist official, said the aid would first and foremost be given to retirees, hospital patients and schoolchildren. He said the food would not be used to feed rebel fighters.

He said: 'The militia will feed itself separately. This is for the residents of the Luhansk People's Republic.'

The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe's observer mission to the Russian-Ukrainian border said Saturday that they had seen 220 trucks cross into Ukraine, none of which were inspected by the Ukrainian side or accompanied by the ICRC.
