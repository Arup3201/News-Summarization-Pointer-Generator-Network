A young father who was told he could lose both his wife and newborn baby is celebrating after his family was allowed home together for the first time.

Kyle Moynan, 26, was told that his wife Lauren’s life hung in the balance after she went into labour at 27 weeks suffering from severe pre-eclampsia.

Medics told him they would have to perform an emergency Caesarean to stand any chance of saving his wife’s life - but that the couple’s daughter would probably not survive such an early birth.

Kyle Moynan was warned that he might lose his wife, Lauren, and daughter, Evie, when Mrs Moynan developed pre-eclampsia and went into premature labour 27 weeks into her pregnancy

Mr Moynan was forced to give the go-ahead for emergency surgery – aware that both his wife and daughter may not survive.

Although surgeons managed to stabilise Mrs Moynan, tiny baby Evie was kept in intensive care for months while doctors tried to save her.

But now, they are celebrating after Evie, now seven months old, has been allowed to go home for the first time - a day Mr Moynan feared he’d never see.

Mr Moynan, from Carlisle, Cumbria, said: ‘There was a time when I feared I’d never have either my wife or my baby at home again - to have them both here is amazing.

‘It was the worst experience of my life. It was so traumatic and I could do nothing but just stand there and watch while the doctors tried to save Lauren and baby Evie.

‘I was worried I was going to lose them both.

Mrs Moynan's organs were starting to fail as a result of the pre-eclampsia so Evie had to be delivered by emergency C-section

‘I am just so relieved to have them both home and safe now. I am grateful to all the doctors who saved their lives.’

Mrs Moynan was rushed to the Cumberland Infirmary after going into labour in the middle of the night when she was just under six months pregnant.

Doctors carried out tests and although she had not realised she was ill, Mrs Moynan was quickly diagnosed with severe pre-eclampsia.

The condition was so advanced that it was causing her organs to fail.

Evie only weighed 1lb 3oz when she was born and her parents were warned that she might not survive

Evie (pictured with her mother) spent the first seven months of her life in hospital - she spent two months in intensive care and she still requires oxygen to help her breathe

HGV engineer Mr Moynan said: ‘Lauren was wired up in the hospital bed. It was horrendous. All I could do is just stand there and watch while the doctors rushed around.

‘There wasn’t time for them to explain what was going on, so I had to just stand there and wait. I knew it had to be serious because of the way they were rushing around but I didn’t have a clue what was happening.

‘After what felt like forever a nurse pulled me to one side and told me that Lauren’s life was in danger and in order to save her life they would have to deliver Evie.’

Distraught Mr Moynan then had to give to go-ahead for an emergency Caesarean, even though doctors warned Evie’s chance of survival were slim, and it was a massive risk.

He said: ‘It was all a blur and I knew it was risky but I couldn’t face losing Lauren and Evie, so I agreed for her to be delivered.

Mrs Moynan said: 'I was so ill and they were pumping me full of drugs. I had cannulas in both arms and doctors all around me. I was just terrified that I would lose my baby'

‘We have two other daughters, Faye, eight, and Sophie, five, and I had to stay strong for them.’

Mrs Moynan said: ‘I was so ill and they were pumping me full of drugs. I had cannulas in both arms and doctors all around me. I was just terrified that I would lose my baby.’

Luckily Evie was safely delivered but weighed only a tiny 1lb 3oz and Mr Moynan only had five minutes to see his newborn before she was rushed to Newcastle’s Royal Infirmary by ambulance, where medics fought to regulate her breathing.

Mrs Moynan said: ‘We didn’t know if baby Evie would survive but because I was so poorly myself I didn’t really know that much about it.’

Mrs Moynan stayed in hospital for a further two weeks and Evie was kept in an incubator in intensive care, where her life hung in the balance for two months.

The dedicated parents travelled to the hospital every day to visit baby Evie, who spent two months in intensive care and one in high dependency before being transferred to the Special Care Baby Unit at the Cumberland Infirmary, from where she has just been released.

Mrs Moynan said: ‘I would never have expected something this drastic would have happened. I just woke up and I was in labour all of sudden. Kyle was at work and I was so scared- luckily he made it to the hospital just in time.’

Mrs Moynan, who works as a nursery practitioner was still working until the day Evie was born.

Evie's parents visited her in the hospital every day but now, at seven months old, she has been allowed home

She said: ‘I had only just started to think about getting things for Evie- we didn’t have her room ready or any clothes for her.’

Baby Evie still has to use an oxygen canister to help her breathe but now weighs a more healthy 12lbs.

Mrs Moynan said: ‘I can’t believe I was so close to losing my own life, and my baby’s. It was such a whirlwind but I am just glad we are home and safe and Evie is doing so well.’

Mr Moynan said: ‘I am thankful for all the doctors did to save Lauren’s life and miracle baby Evie is doing well at home and getting stronger every day.’

Pre-eclampsia is a condition that affects some pregnant women during the second half of their pregnancy.

Early signs of the condition include high blood pressure and protein in the urine.

As the condition becomes more advanced, further symptoms can develop.

These include swelling of the feet, face and hands, a severe headache, vision problems and pain below the ribs.

Pre-eclampsia affects up to five per cent of pregnancies and is severe in about one to two per cent.

It is more likely during a first pregnancy, if the woman has had it in a previous pregnancy, if the woman has a family history of the condition, if the woman is over 40, or if she is carrying more than one baby.

The condition is often mild but can lead to severe complications if it is not monitored and treated.

The only way to cure pre-eclampsia is to deliver the baby, until this happens, some sufferers are given medication to lower their blood pressure.

Although most cases of pre-eclampsia do not lead to problems, there is a risk that the mother will develop fits - these can be life threatening for the mother and baby but are rare.

Occasionally, the condition can also cause the mother to suffer a stroke or organ failure.

About six or seven women die from complications of pre-eclampsia in the UK every year and about 1,000 babies die as a result of the condition - usually because of complications of early delivery.
