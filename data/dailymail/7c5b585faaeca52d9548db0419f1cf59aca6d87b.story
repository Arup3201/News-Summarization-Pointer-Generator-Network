Should FIFA ban Luis Suarez after latest bite storm?

Luis Suarez should not be allowed to kick another ball in this World Cup tournament.

Referee Marco Rodriguez clearly missed the coming together of Suarez and Italian Giorgio Chiellini and replays are clear enough to me for the Uruguayan to be charged by FIFA's disciplinary panel.

FIFA do not consult referees with regard to charging players retrospectively as they accept that if no action is taken the officials have missed the incident.

'We are awaiting the official match report and will gather all the necessary elements before making a decision.’

The score at the time of the incident was 0-0, a result good enough for the Italians to qualify.

However there is no prospect of a rematch or a change to Uruguay qualifying.

FIFA has ordered a game to be replayed after a refereeing error (Uzbekistan v Bahrain in qualifying for Germany 2006) but this is not in the same category.
