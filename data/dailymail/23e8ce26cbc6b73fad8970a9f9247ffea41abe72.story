An Adelaide cigarette shop has come under fire from angry parents after it advertised a free in store face painting event for children.

The face painting was on offer at the Smokemart & GiftBox store at West Lakes, north-west of Adelaide, on Saturday.

Cancer Council SA say they fielded a number of complaints from 'shocked' parents before and after the event.

'We received calls from concerned members of the public who were understandably shocked that children were being encouraged to visit a cigarette retailer through an in-store face painting promotion,' Dr Marion Eckert, Cancer Council SA's general manager of cancer control, told MailOnline.

'To entice children into a tobacconist on the basis of a fun activity like face painting, simply adds to the miscomprehension of the dangers of smoking.'

The face painting event was organised as a fundraiser in conjunction with Westfield West Lakes to raise money for the Cora Barclay centre – a charity for deaf children.

A spokesman from the Smokemart store said he didn't agree that it was 'inappropriate' to hold an event for children at the cigarette shop, according to the Advertiser.

Tony De Maria, from Peregrine Corporation which owns the Smokemart chain, told the newspaper they had been invited to take part and donated a few hundred dollars, which Westfield then matched.

'We sell many other products - all the cigarettes are against one wall and most of them are hidden by legislation (and) most of our shop is a gift shop,' Mr De Maria said.

He said the face painting was held outside the store, despite it being advertised online as an 'in store' event.

The Cancer Council said around 90 percent of smokers start when they are teenagers and don't 'fully comprehend the consequences of taking up the habit'. 

'Tobacco kills around 20 South Australians every week and it is entirely inappropriate to have children's promotions associated in any way with these deadly product,' Dr Eckert said.
