Danny Welbeck's status as 'Dat Guy' has penetrated the Arsenal dressing-room, as Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain used the phrase to mock his new club and international teammate.

The Arsenal players seemed to be having a good time as they prepared for the clubs official team photo.

Chamberlain enjoyed some banter with Spanish-speaking players including young full back Hector Bellerin, and complained that he is always shunted to the outside of the photo.

However he seemed to take solace in the fact that Santi Cazorla was placed even wider, while the Spaniard appeared to be spiking up his hair to appear taller.

Jack Wilshere led the complaints that Lukas Podolski, who many expected to leave the club this summer, was given a spot in the middle of the photo.

Arsenal's younger players  showed they were not intimidated by their more experienced club-mates, with Germany youth international Serge Gnabry slapping Mesut Ozil and then Francis Coquelin hitting Jack Wilshere on the head, while goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny almost got in trouble as he aimed a shot at the Arsenal TV cameraman.

The Gunners eventually managed to get the photo taken before being joined by their Arsenal Ladies counterparts.
