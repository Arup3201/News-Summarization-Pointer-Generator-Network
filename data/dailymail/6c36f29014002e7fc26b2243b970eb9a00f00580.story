Lance Armstrong won't interview under oath with the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency to reveal all he knows about doping in cycling, his attorney has said.

USADA officials had told Armstrong he must speak with them if he wanted to reduce his lifetime ban from cycling and compete again - and today was the deadline.

After more than two months of negotiations, Armstrong attorney Tim Herman said today that the cyclist won't participate in a process designed 'only to demonize selected individuals.'

Armstrong had previously said he was willing to participate in an international effort to clean up a sport that is based mostly in Europe.

For years, Armstrong denied using performance-enhancing drugs.

But last year, USADA released a report that detailed extensive doping on his seven Tour de France-winning teams and stripped him of those titles.

Armstrong then admitted last month in an
interview with 'Queen of Talk' Oprah Winfrey that he doped and used 
performance-enhancing drugs to win those races.

'We remain hopeful that an international
effort will be mounted and we will do everything we can to facilitate 
that result,' Mr Herman said in a statement.

Confession: Armstrong admitted to Oprah Winfrey that his seven Tour de France titles were won with the help of performance-enhancing drugs, but he denied that he used them for his 2009 comeback

'Lance will not participate in USADA's efforts to selectively conduct American prosecutions that only demonize selected individuals while failing to address the 95 per cent of the sport over which USADA has no jurisdiction.'

Armstrong is facing several legal challenges, and testifying under oath to USADA could have exposed him to further troubles.

Armstrong was the subject of a two-year federal criminal investigation that was dropped in February with no charges filed, but the Department of Justice is still considering whether to join a federal whistle-blower lawsuit filed by former Armstrong teammate Floyd Landis.

Armstrong also has been sued by a Dallas-based SCA Promotions to recover more than $12million in bonuses.

He also has been sued to by The Sunday Times in London to recover a libel judgment that Armstrong won against the paper.
