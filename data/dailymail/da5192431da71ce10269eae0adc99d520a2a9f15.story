Instinct took over for James Rodriguez at Anfield.

The Colombian superstar was left in a daze early on but it had nothing to do with his new multi-coloured boots.

Instead, Real Madrid's Rodriguez suffered a nasty cut above his eye and was forced to change his shirt barely 15 minutes into the 3-0 win over Liverpool.

As he returned to the field, dressed with a bandage to protect his wound, the 23-year-old showed exactly why Real were so quick to snap him from Monaco last summer.

On 23 minutes, Rodriguez peeled away from his marker Alberto Moreno to find space in front of Liverpool's back four.

The £60million man then played a sublime exchange with Cristiano Ronaldo. He expertly trapped the ball sumptuous one-touch control on his right, before splitting the defence with a deft flick with his left to return it into the path of his prolific team-mate, who duly buried it beyond a helpless Simon Mignolet.

But Rodriguez was always going to stand out at Anfield from the moment he stepped on the Merseyside turf.

He was wearing the new adidas Crazylight F50 boots. Weighing just 215g, the electric green, blue and orange design equally caught the eye as Rodriguez put in a peerless shift.

It's not the first time he's worn a whacky pair of boots either. Earlier this month against Ludogorets, he wore the unique Yohji Yamamoto signature studs.

And after his World Cup heroics in Brazil last summer, don't forget is he is the proud owner of the Golden Boot!
