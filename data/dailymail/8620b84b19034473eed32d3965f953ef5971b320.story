PICTURE OF THE DAY

Aren't you a tad under-dressed, Arsene? The Arsenal manager looked relaxed in his training kit as he had dinner with some football pals in Brazil, including Fabio Cannavaro.

Not sure Arsenal’s new sponsor Puma will be happy to see him in Nike gear...

Brazil-Colombia rivalry was not confined to the pitch on Friday night night.

Before the game fans from both nations - including two Colombian TV stars - were involved in anexchange in a restaurant.

Plates were thrown and glasses were smashed.

ABSENT FRIENDS

UEFA president Michel Platini was not watching France’s quarter-final defeat in Rio. Instead he had flown to Glasgow to attend the funeral of former SFA chief executive David Taylor who worked with Platini at UEFA.

ICE-COOL GERMANS

Germany certainly didn’t feel the heat ahead of last night’s game in Rio - each player had their own bowl of freezing cold water in the dressing room.

Icy: The Germans will be well prepared for their big clash with France

BEST OF THE BETS

Our top tipsters Brian Lee and Chris Cutmore go head-to-head with the best bets. Here are theirs for Saturday’s games.

Best-bet Brian

13/2 - Marouane Fellaini has been off form but he’s a good bet to score at any time against Argentina.

Cut-price Chris

6/1 - Holland to win 2-0 looks a decent price with Costa Rica’s remarkable run surely at an end.

Good bet: Manchester United midfielder Marouane Fellaini is 13/2 to score for Belgium against Argentina
