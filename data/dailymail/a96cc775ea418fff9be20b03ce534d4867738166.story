A White House official said Tuesday that while it would welcome 'an encounter' between President Barack Obama and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani in 
New York, Iranian officials have turned them down.

Obama told the United Nations General 
Assembly on Tuesday that the United States is primarily focusing its diplomatic efforts 
on Iran's nuclear program and the Israel-Palestinian conflict.

The
U.S., he said, will support Iran's use of nuclear energy, and will 
attempt to negotiate directly with Rouhani.

'Americans see an Iranian government that has declared the United States an enemy,' he said, 'and directly – or through proxies – taken Americans hostage, killed U.S. troops and civilians, and threatened our ally Israel with destruction.'

'I don’t believe this difficult history can be overcome overnight – the suspicion runs too deep. But I do believe that if we can resolve the issue of Iran’s nuclear program, that can serve as a major step down a long road towards a different relationship – one based on mutual interests and mutual respect.

That phrase – mutual respect – is one that Iran has used lately to demonstrate its eagerness for acceptance in the West.

Obama told the UN that 'the world is more stable than it was 5 years ago,' but then spoke of the shopping mall massacre in Kenya and suicide bombings in Pakistan

Bashar al-Assad has been pleading his case on television in country after country -- in this case, Monday on Chinese state CCTV. He cautioned that rebels might block inspectors from reaching some of the locations where chemical weapons are stored

'The Iranians have an internal dynamic that they have to manage and the relationship with the United States is clearly quite different than the relationship that Iran has with other Western nations," a senior administration official told Politico.

Obama said he had instructed Secretary of State John Kerry to talk directly with Iran.

He
also demanded a UN Security Council resolution on Tuesday that would 
hold Syrian President Bashar al-Assad responsible for an August 21 
chemical weapons attack that killed more than 1,400, saying 'the evidence is overwhelming' that the Syrian dictator was behind the action.

'It's an insult to human reason ... to suggest that anyone other than the regime carried out this attack,' Obama said.

And in a defense of the United States, Obama claimed American exceptionalism is alive and well.

'Some may disagree, but I believe America is exceptional,' he told the General Assembly, standing up 'for the interests of all.'

In
a New York Times op-ed earlier this month, Russian President Vladimir 
Putin wrote that it is 'extremely dangerous to encourage people to see 
themselves as exceptional, whatever the motivation.'

Noting that Assad has 'given an 
accounting' of its chemical weapons stockpiles and promised to have them
dismantled, Obama told diplomats that 'there must be a strong Security 
Council resolution to verify that the Assad regime is keeping its 
commitments.'

'There must 
be consequences if they fail to do so,' the president added. 'If we 
cannot agree even on this, then it will show that the United Nations is 
incapable of enforcing the most basic of international laws.'

Obama said Tuesday that he had written a letter to Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei, emphasizing that he wants a diplomatic solution to Iran's growing nuclear program

'Our
response has not matched the scale of the challenge' in Syria, Obama 
said, where 'peaceful protests against an authoritarian regime were met 
with oppression and slaughter.'

While
Obama demanded a Security Council resolution that provides a penalty if
Syria renegs on its commitment, he reiterated that his preference 'has 
always been a diplomatic resolution to this issue'

And, he said, he has no desire to determine who leads Syria, whether it's Assad or a replacement.

'That's
for the Syrian people to decide,' he said, noting that U.S.-led regime 
change in other parts of the world have been fraught with unintended 
consequences.

'The United States has a hard-earned 
humility when it comes to our ability to determine events inside other 
people's countries,' Obama conceded.

But, he insisted, the U.S. must remain engaged in Syria for its own national security reasons.

The White House said after Obama's 
speech that the United States will provide $339 million in new Syrian 
humanitarian aid, bringing the U.S. funding total to nearly $1.4 
billion.

That humanitarian 
assistance, the administration said, includes food, clean water, 
shelter, medical care, and relief supplies to over 4.2 million people 
inside Syria and more than two million refugees.

At a luncheon event Tuesday, Obama thanked the UN for providing the weapons inspectors who determined the scale of the Aug. 21 chemical weapons attack in a Damascus suburb and collected evidence of who was to blame.

'The dedicated U.N. inspectors in Damascus,' he said, 'set out into battlefield conditions.  They braved sniper fire. They worked diligently with great professionalism. They uncovered the truth, and they have the thanks of the world.'

Rep. Ed Royce said the U.S. should 'double down' on sanctions against Iran in order to avoid repeating the mistakes made with North Korea

Iranian President Hassan Rouhani continues to pursue his country's nuclear program, while Obama cautions against the development of atomic weapons

John Bolton, the former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, was critical of both the Security Council and the General Assembly, writing on Tuesday that its usefulness is limited.

'There is no such thing as the United Nations,' Bolton wrote in The Washington Times. 'It is simply a collection of nations pursuing their respective interests, from time to time led by the United States.'

Rep. Ed Royce, the California Republican who chairs the House Foreign Affairs Committee, told Fox News that in dealing with Iran, the U.S. should look at 'the mistake we made in 2005 or 2006' in lifting sanctions against North Korea, allowing then-president Kim Jong-Il to drag out negotiations while he built a nuclear weapons program.

'Instead,' he said, 'we should double down' on Iranian sanctions and force President Rouhani's hand.

Speaking of Iran, the president said that he had written both Rouhani and Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Hosseini Khamenei to say 'that America prefers to resolve our concerns over Iran’s nuclear program peacefully, but that we are determined to prevent them from developing a nuclear weapon.'

'We are not seeking regime change, and we respect the right of the Iranian people to access peaceful nuclear energy,' he insisted.
