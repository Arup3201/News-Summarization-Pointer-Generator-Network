These photos show how a traffic warden in a £4.40-an-hour zone was allegedly caught threatening to hand out a parking ticket - but then backed down after being handed a £20 bribe by a driver.

A journalist was parked without a ticket on a street in London’s Mayfair when a civil enforcement officer (CEO) wearing a Westminster City Council jacket approached and threatened to fine him.

But the traffic warden, employed by the UK’s biggest parking contractor NSL, allegedly said he could ‘sort something out’ if he was paid - and would stop any local wardens putting a ticket on the car.

Taking the cash: Drivers normally have to pay £4.40 per 60 minutes for a maximum of four hours on the street

The Daily Star Sunday reporter came back later and asked if the deal will still on if he came back the next day and parked on the same road. The traffic warden was captured on video saying ‘yes’.

The reporter gave the warden £20 the next day and was not issued with a fine, as promised. Other cars in the street without valid tickets or permits were allegedly also not given penalty notices.

Drivers normally have to pay £4.40 per 60 minutes for a maximum of four hours on a street in the exclusive London area, and can be given an £80 fine if they do not have a ticket or resident’s permit.

A spokesman for Westminster City Council said it was a contractor's fault. He added: 'We expect the highest standards from all of our contractors, especially when it comes to employing suitable staff.

'We have been assured that NSL are investigating the allegations fully, and as a matter of urgency.'

NSL, formerly known as NCP, runs parking enforcement on the streets of more than 60 councils.

Its spokesman Dr Belinda Webb told MailOnline: 'On Friday we were made aware that the (Daily Star Sunday) had filmed a civil enforcement officer, employed by NSL, allegedly accepting a bribe.

'Our initial investigations show that the accused CEO had recorded on his handheld computer the fact that someone had offered him a £20 note at the time the Star alleges it occurred'

'As the biggest employer of CEOs we 
treat all such allegations very seriously. It is because of this that 
our CEOs undergo robust screening and periodic checks.

'We can confirm that our initial 
investigations show that the accused CEO had recorded on his handheld 
computer the fact that someone had offered him a £20 note at the time 
the Star alleges it occurred.

'We have taken the routine measure of
changing the CEO's duties until the Star allows us to see the video 
footage it claims to possess, which shall then inform our investigation.'
