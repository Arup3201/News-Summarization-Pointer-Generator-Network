'Vivacious and beautiful': Anni Dewani always put the needs of others above her own

Honeymoon murder victim Anni Dewani decided to call off her wedding hours before it was due to happen but was convinced by her cousin to reconsider.

Speaking for the first time, Sneha Hindocha said she deeply regrets talking Anni into staying and will always live with the burden that she might have been able to save her life.

Days before her lavish £200,000 wedding in India the 28-year-old murder victim frantically called Sneha and announced the ceremony was off.

She had thrown her engagement ring at Shrien Dewani and told him she wanted to return to London.

But,
 trying to be level-headed, Sneha told Anni it would be best to talk 
things through with the millionaire Bristol businessman before making such a big
 decision.

Soon after the call, Anni was putting on her sari and getting ready to make a life-long commitment to her future husband.

'I wish I had just told her to come home, then she would still be here today.' Sneha told the Sunday Mirror.

'That's my regret and I'm going to have to carry it with me for the rest of my life.'

Two
 weeks later, Anni was dead. She was killed when the car she was 
travelling in with her new husband was hijacked in a township in Cape 
Town, South Africa, while the couple were on honeymoon.

Dewani
 is accused of organising the murder and is due to appear in court next 
month where he will appeal a judge's decision to return to the African 
country, to face further questioning.

Sneha
 said Anni was a popular young woman because of her vivacious 
personality and striking beauty and would always put the needs of others
 above her own.

Devastated: Sneha Hindocha has deep regrets over her cousin's death

After university the qualified Engineer put her career plans on hold so she could be there for her mother Nilam Hindocha, who was diagnosed with cancer.

Later
 she landed a position with mobile phone giant Ericsson and in May 2009,
 during a trip to London with Sneha, she was introduced to Mr Dewani.

According
 to her cousin, it was not love at first sight but he is said to have 
won Anni over with his charms and respectful behaviour.

Less than a year later, in March, Anni and Sneha decided to move to the UK where they shared a flat in Luton.

Things moved quickly between Anni and her new boyfriend and soon the Hindocha family were introduced to the Dewanis.

Months later Dewani proposed to Anni and presented her with a £25,000 engagement ring,  while the couple were having dinner at the Ritz in Paris.

But Sneha said the doubts soon started to surface and Anni complained that Dewani was controlling and pedantic.

He
 would fold his dirty laundry before putting it in the washing basket 
and according to Sneha, complained that Anni's sari was not sitting 
right when he first saw her on their wedding day.

The last time Sneha saw Anni was before the couple left for their honeymoon. Anni was later shot on November 13 and Dewani escaped, without injury.

Dewani, 32, said he and the driver Zola Tonga, were forced out of the taxi before Anni was driven away.

Unsure: Anni started to have regrets about her relationship with Shrien who she claimed was controlling

Tonga has since been jailed for 18 years and has claimed that Dewani paid him to £1,200 to arrange the killing.

A
 year after her death, thousands of people will be paying tribute to 
Anni in a candlelight vigil which will take place in Bristol, London, 
Cape Town and her home town of Mariestad, Sweden later today.

Anni's father Vinod Hindocha said it was a ceremony so that people could remember his beautiful daughter.
