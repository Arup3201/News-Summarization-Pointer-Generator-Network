Emily Horne, who dressed up as a man to pose as her seventh husband in order to obtain prescription medicine walks free from court

A serial bigamist who dressed up as a man and  posed as her seventh 'husband' in order to get prescription drugs, was spared a jail sentence today.

Former glamour model Emily Horne, 33, cropped her hair and donned a baggy football shirt and trousers to con a doctor into giving her sleeping pills she was addicted to.

She told medics she was her husband, Craig Hadwin, serving in the Navy at RNAS Yeovilton, Somerset.

Horne, of Wells, Somerset, had 'married' him earlier in 2011 in a bogus ceremony in Scotland before using his name to dupe doctors into giving her sleeping pills.

The 33-year-old has been jailed before for bigamy after she failed to divorce her first husband Paul Rigby - and went on to ‘marry’ six more husbands between 1999 and 2011.

Horne admitted fraud after fooling her unsuspecting doctor and was sentenced for duping her GP into giving her prescription drugs in court in Taunton, Somerset.

Judge Jonathan Barnes told her: 'You have come terribly, terribly close to being sent to prison. This will be the last chance.

'Fundamentally I think you are a sad figure with serious problems rather than a wicked person. I feel the interests of justice do not require that I send you to prison today.'

He said she had breached a two-year 
suspended sentence for bigamy from 2009 but said: 'You have not again 
gone through a ceremony of marriage and you have disclosed the fact that
you are apparently even now still married.' 

He sentenced her to a community order 
with a 12-hour nighttime curfew, seven days a week for 28 days, and 12 
months supervision.

Prosecutor Nigel Askham said: 'She has a history of deception. She has used a number of aliases.'

Emily Horne, who has worked as a glamour model in the past, admitted to dressing up as her seventh 'husband' in order to feed her addiction to prescription drugs

In January 2009 she was in court for 11 similar offences of obtaining prescription painkillers.

Defence barrister Rebecca Bradbury said Horne was overcoming her addiction with the help of her GP and a loving partner and she is now living in an abandoned pub in Wells.

Miss Bradbury said: 'She has really been incapable of being honest in these relationships. She has not had the courage or foresight to admit she is still married.

'She has not committed any further offences of bigamy.'

She added Horne’s previous 
supervision related to her relationships with men and how to conduct 
these relationships and keep herself safe.

'This
is a woman who due to injury and her psychiatric history had been given
swathes of prescription medicine which she is now addicted to and has 
come to use as a crutch.'

Horne wore a black trouser suit to court and a black bandana with white anchors to cover her cropped hair.

Horne admitted two fraud allegations in Castle Cary in July and Yeovil in May after using fraudulent details to obtain prescription drugs. She has also asked for three other similar offences to be taken into consideration.

At an earlier hearing the prosecution said Horne has an extensive medical history including her addiction to prescribed painkillers and sedatives and has used a string of aliases to trick health service professionals into handing over various drugs.

In May she telephoned the NHS out of hours service claiming to be the sister of Accastes Hadwin ringing on her behalf to say she needed painkillers after she had been assaulted.

She gave a false address but was prescribed diazepam and the same day, rang again claiming to be her sister in law, saying she was experiencing more pain and was prescribed codeine phosphate.

After a failed attempt to get drugs from a GP’s surgery in Ilchester, she made an appointment for her husband to see a GP in Castle Cary.

Further painkillers were given to her when she went to the A&E department at a Taunton hospital in July saying she was Cassie Hadwin.

She said she had hurt her wrist in a fall, asked for her arm to be put in plaster and was prescribed co-codamol tablets for the pain.

Horne is no stranger to courts because of her tangled marital status and was still subject to a suspended jail term imposed by a Manchester court in 2009.

Horne's web of lies started soon after she married her first husband, Paul Rigby, in 1996 when she was 18.

They split up after three months, however, and three years later she wed Sean Cunningham.

Their relationship ended after a couple of months and she left him for his friend, Simon Thorpe - the man who had given her away at her wedding to Mr Cunningham.

While Horne and Thorpe were engaged 
she married another two men, Chris Barrett, who she met on a bus, and 
James Matthews, who she met on a train where he worked as a conductor.

It was at this time that Horne started working as a glamour model, appearing in X-rated films.

When Horne refused to return to Matthews after walking out on him to live with one of his friends, he contacted police.

Husbands four and five: James Matthews, left, and Ashley Baker, right, both fell under Horne's spell and both found out she was still married soon after their own weddings to her

She was jailed for bigamy in 2004 but three years after her release Ashley Baker fell under her spell.

He stood by her for another 10 months despite her honeymoon confession that he was husband number five after she lied, telling him she had cancer.

In 2010 she met IT worker Stuart Allen from Burnley and he soon became 'smitten' with the brunette who introduced herself as Max.

She agreed to marry him, but when she went away for a few days to visit her father, he learned she had actually gone to the U.S. to marry policeman Fred Miller who she had met online.

After just a few days into her honeymoon with husband number six, their marriage fell apart and Horne returned to England to live on benefits in Wareham, Dorset.

In early 2011 she married her seventh husband, Mr Hadwin, at a ceremony in Scotland after meeting him on a dating website.

Horne, who changed her name to Max Accastes Quiberon by deed poll in 2010, did not comment as she left the court.
