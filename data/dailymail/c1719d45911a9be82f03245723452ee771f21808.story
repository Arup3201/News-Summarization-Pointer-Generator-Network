David Cameron has succeeded in fulfilling his pledge to increase spending on the health service every year, new figures show.

The Prime Minister has come under pressure for his refusal to lift the ringfence protection from cuts given to the NHS while Labour has accused the coalition of failing to increase spending as promised.

But new Treasury data published today show real terms increases in NHS spending in each year since the coalition was formed.

Spending: New data released today shows how health spending has risen in real terms since 2010-11, after the coalition was formed in May 2010

The figures, which cover actual spending from 2008-09 to 2012-13, lay bare that the only cut in spending came in the 2010-11 financial year which began in the last weeks of the Labour government.

The Public Spending Statistics show that Health (NHS) spending increased from £104.405billioln in 2011-12 to £105.254billion in 2012-13. It amounts to a 0.8 per cent rise in real terms year-on-year.

In 2011-12, health spending was 0.3 per cent higher than a year earlier.

Ministers are confident that over their Spending Review period, the Government has continued to meet its promise to provide a real terms increase in the health budget.

A Treasury source said: ‘Because of tough decisions this Government has taken on welfare we are able to increase NHS spending.

‘Labour claim protecting the NHS is irresponsible and would cut the NHS, like they have in Wales, where they are in charge.’

The figures will provide a major boost to Mr Cameron, who staked his personal reputation on a pledge not to cut health funding.

Promise: Prime Minister David Cameron has been under pressure to stick to his pledge on health spending

During the 2010 election campaign the Tory leader appeared on a poster proclaiming: ‘Ill cut the deficit not the NHS.’

Ahead of the Budget and spending review this year there were renewed calls to remove the ringfence from health spending.

But Mr Cameron suggested he would 
never allow the NHS budget to be cut while he was Prime Minister. He 
said: ‘When you look particularly at the NHS, you know that we have got 
an ageing population.

‘There
is massive pressure on the NHS, more expensive treatments and drugs are
coming through, and I just don’t believe it is practical or right to 
cut the NHS,’ Mr Cameron said in March.

Row: Labour shadow health minister Jamie Reed repeated the claim that the coalition cut the NHS in its first year

‘As prime minister I am never short of 
advice. But there’s one piece of advice I won’t take and that’s the 
piece of advice that says you ought to cut the National Health Service 
budget.’

Last year the coalition became embroiled in a public spat with Andrew Dilnot, the head of the UK Statistics Authority, over the claim to have increased NHS spending each year.

He argued that ‘expenditure on the NHS in real terms was lower in 2011-12 than it was in 2009-10’.

But the coalition argued that the cut in 2010-11 was put in place by the last Labour government.

In each year since Mr Cameron’s spending plans have been in place, health spending has risen.

However, shadow health minister Jamie Reed insisted that the complaint from Mr Dilnot as still valid.

He said: ‘David Cameron famously promised he would cut the deficit, not the NHS.

‘But we have it in black and white from the statistics chief: he cut the NHS in his first year in Government.

‘There could be no clearer evidence of the failure of this Prime Minister and his Government.

‘This mismatch between David Cameron's promises and the reality on the ground cannot be allowed to continue. These real-terms cuts explain why hospitals in England do not have adequate staffing levels and why over 4,000 nursing jobs have been lost on David Cameron’s watch.’
