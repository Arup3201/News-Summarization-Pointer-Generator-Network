The widow of a man who Jennifer Aniston recently called 'the one' in an interview is slamming the actress over her comments.

Mujah Maraini-Melehi, who was married Daniel McDonald and had two children with the actor before he tragically passed away, is calling out the 'media savvy' actress saying 'she was not present during his difficult illness'.

McDonald, who dated Aniston for five years in the '90s, died in 2007 of brain cancer.

Too soon: Jen was talking about McDonald when she recently described a former boyfriend who was 'the one' but who died an early death due to brain cancer, according to a source close to the actress. Before his death in 2007, McDonald married Italian actress and film maker Mujah Maraini-Melehi. Their family pictured above

'He would not approve of all this uninvited attention,' said Maraini-Melehi of McDonald

In an interview with the New York Times as part of her aggressive push to grab an Oscar nomination for her role in the film Cake, Aniston said of McDonald, who she dated in her early twenties: 'He would have been "the one". But I was 25 and I was stupid.'

She went on to say; 'He must have sent me Justin to make up for it all.'

This in reference to the actress' current fiancé, Justin Theroux.

Maraini-Melehi took to Facebook after seeing Aniston's interview and said; 'I am very upset that the media is exploiting Daniel’s memory in connection to Jennifer Aniston. 

'What is precious shines in our hearts and should not be splayed for everyone’s consumption in the media this way.'

She then goes after Aniston, saying; 'Why now? I wonder. After decades of stardom, she is media savvy enough to know that any casual comment she makes becomes front page tabloid news. Jennifer Aniston is Jennifer Aniston, and that means that anything that she says about her love life to any journalist, even someone as reputable as New York Times’ Frank Bruni, will be later dissected and exploited.'

Aniston has yet to respond to these comments.

Maraini-Melehi then adds: 'It pains me to read the headlines that allude to her losing him tragically when she was not present during his long and difficult illness.'

She also reveals that she reached out to Aniston after McDonald died to see if the actress wanted any photos he had of the two back, but she never responded. 

Maraini-Melehi and McDonald were married until his death in 2007

As for McDonald, Mariana-Melehi, who married Luca Aureggi in September 2014, says, 'He would not approve of all this uninvited attention.' 

‘Jennifer never stopped loving Daniel, but things were happening very fast with her career by that time – it was just a year before she landed Friends,' a source previously revealed to DailyMail.com.

'She’d moved to Los Angeles, and Daniel stayed on in New York and was doing Broadway.

‘After Dan and Jen split, she went on to date and become engaged to actor Tate Donavan, but I don’t think she ever got over letting Dan slip through her fingers.’ 

Added the source; ‘Daniel was a lovely guy. He was open, honest and funny, and I know Jennifer really loved him. The timing was just off for them I guess.'

In light of what’s been happening around the world, this may seem like a very trivial and superficial post.

This past 24 hours have been very difficult for me….. I am very upset that the media is exploiting Daniel’s memory in connection to Jennifer Aniston. What is precious shines in our hearts and should not be splayed for everyone’s consumption in the media this way. 

Why now? I wonder. After decades of stardom, she is media savvy enough to know that any casual comment she makes becomes front page tabloid news. Jennifer Aniston is Jennifer Aniston, and that means that anything that she says about her love life to any journalist, even someone as reputable as New York Times’ Frank Bruni, will be later dissected and exploited. 

My heart aches to see our tragedy of losing Daniel to serve the media’s hunger for sensationalism. I remember how journalists often called our home to ask Daniel for information about Jennifer, and being the gentleman that he was, he would always decline to comment on anything at all. I imagine he would be appalled to be caught up in this media circus, especially after he had found Love and built a family of his own.

His love is part of our fabric -- part of me , part of Fosco, part of Ondina. Please respect our love and especially our Loss. The children lost their father. I lost my partner. I am sorry that Jennifer did not realize the treasure that was Daniel when she had the chance, long before he and I met and long before he died. It pains me to read the headlines that allude to her losing him tragically when she was not present during his long and difficult illness. 

That said perhaps Daniel’s gift was to teach her how to love and appreciate Justin Theroux. I know how much Daniel cared about her, and how protective he was of her. That was part of what I loved about him. I find it very hard to believe that she may not have married Brad Pitt had Daniel and I not married months before as some unnamed “sources” declared to the Daily mail on line. After Daniel died, I reached out to her to give her back all the photographs from the time they were together. I never got an answer back from her.

Please ignore the gossip and remember what is essential; the music in Daniel’s heart lingers on in us, in his dear friends, his mother Pat, his siblings who miss him every day, his cousins, his nieces and nephews, his colleagues, his fans, his children, and me.
