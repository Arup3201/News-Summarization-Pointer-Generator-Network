A former Centrelink telephone operator claims he became so distressed taking calls from desperate welfare claimants that he now suffers from ‘telephone phobia’ and is unable to earn a living.

Mark Grant has lost his legal bid for workers’ compensation, after claiming he developed his intense fear due to the ‘despair’ he faced, taking 60 calls a day 'that pulled at his heartstrings'.

Mr Grant, now a taxi driver, worked in the role for the Department of Human Services for six months in 2008 and says the illness arises from ‘the taking of telephone calls, fear or what/who the next call might be.’ 

Mark Grant (not pictured) has lost his legal bid for workers’ compensation, after claiming he developed his intense fear due to the ‘despair’ he faced, taking 60 calls a day 'that pulled at his heartstrings'.

He believes the phobia was triggered by ‘so many people living in despair; so many people ripping off the system, the system being unfair/rigid’.

The taxi driver told the tribunal that stressful aspects of the role included:

'Young people who were unable to get jobs pulled at my heart strings, people would say they are unable to pay the rent, let alone pay to travel to a job interview,'

'People who were relying on the generosity of friends.’

Mr Grant insists that the telephone phobia occurred as a result of his role as a telephone operator.

‘If I had had a telephone phobia prior to commencing at Centrelink, it would have made no sense for me to have taken a job as a call centre operator,’ Mr Grant said, according to court documents. 

Mr Grant, now a taxi driver, worked in the role for the Department of Human Services for six months in 2008 and says the illness arises from ‘the taking of telephone calls, fear or what/who the next call might be.’

Mr Grant also claims that he suffered when he was subjected to aggressive phone calls – yet tribunal member Naida Isenberg confirms there is no evidence Mr Grant made any complaints about specific incidents of threat or abuse. 

However, three medical experts ruled Mr Grant's condition was directly related to the failure of his mortgage broking business, which Mr Grant was running whilst working at Centrelink.

Mr Grant's mortgage broking business, which employed up to ten people, went into liquidation in July 2009. 

He was working at Centrelink in 2008 from May to November.  

Mr Grant took the matter to a tribunal after unsuccessfully lodging a Disability Support Pension claim with Centrelink and a workers' compensation claim with Comcare.

Mr Grant lodged an unsuccessful workers' compensation claim with federal workplace insurer Comcare in May 2013, more than four years after ceasing employment at Centrelink.

When his business went into liquidation, Mr Grant was forced to live off his income protection insurance. When the funds ran out he made an unsuccessful Disability Support Pension claim with his former employer, Centrelink. 

Following a trail of unsuccessful claims, Mr Grant pursued his tribunal hearing.  

Tribunal member Naida Isenberg ruled that Mr Grant's condition was not a result of his employment at Centrelink 'at all', therefore he is not eligible for benefits from Comcare.

Tribunal member Ms Isenberg ruled that Mr Grant's condition was not a result of his employment at Centrelink 'at all', therefore he is not eligible for benefits from Comcare. 

'The medical evidence... does not attribute the applicant’s psychological condition to his Centrelink workplace at all, let alone to a 'significant degree'', said Ms Isenberg.

Mr Grant is now working as a taxi driver and is not required to take phone calls, relying on the network computer.

Daily Mail Australia tried to contact Mr Grant for comment but phone calls were unsuccessful.
