Pulling out: Derbyshire Police Authority's vice-chairman, Alan Charles, withdrew from the police commissioner elections because of a minor offence he committed 47 years ago

A senior councillor has pulled out of the race to become a police commissioner because of an offence he committed 47 years ago as a 14-year-old - the second candidate in a week to withdraw from the elections.

Alan Charles, the vice-chairman of Derbyshire Police Authority, had intended to stand as a Labour candidate but withdrew after revealing he was given a conditional discharge for a minor non-violent crime in 1965.

His case echoes that of Bob Ashford, who quit as the Labour candidate in Avon and Somerset on Tuesday over a £5 fine he was given for two minor offences committed 46 years ago when he was just 13.

Mr Ashford has described as 'absolutely ridiculous' rules which bar candidates from standing if they have been convicted as a juvenile of something that would carry a prison sentence if committed by an adult.

Mr Charles did not disclose the nature of his previous offence, which had not been revealed by a criminal records check.

He said: 'I have taken the difficult decision to stand down as the Labour Party candidate for police and crime commissioner for Derbyshire.

'The Labour Party has only now received clarification from the Home Office and the Electoral Commission that juvenile convictions for imprisonable offences will bar people from becoming a police and crime commissioner.'

Mr Charles added: 'Despite serving as vice-chair of Derbyshire Police Authority, I have received confirmation that a minor criminal offence I committed around 47 years ago, for which I was given a year's conditional discharge, has barred me from standing.

Mr Charles's withdrawal is a further 
policy setback for Home Secretary Theresa May, who said earlier this 
year that it had not been ministers' intention to bar people who were 
guilty of minor offences as teenagers.

Police commissioners, due to be elected in November, will have the power to hire and fire chief constables.

Among the other candidates is the former Deputy Prime Minister, Lord Prescott, who is seeking office in the Humberside Police area.

Mr Ashford, who has Whitehall security clearance, stepped down from his £90,000-a-year job as director of strategy for the Youth Justice Board partly to run for the role.

But he was forced to withdraw from the race because he was convicted in 1966 of trespass on the railway and possession of an offensive weapon.

The father of four, of Frome, Somerset, has received hundreds of emails of support and is to seek legal advice on whether there are grounds for him to challenge the legislation.

He said: ‘This was a flawed policy idea from the beginning and it’s now proving to be absolutely and fatally flawed.’

The rules had already led war veteran Simon Weston to pull out because he feared that his £30 fine at the age of 14 for being a passenger in a stolen car would have disqualified him.

The former Welsh Guardsman suffered horrific burns to 46 per cent of his body during the Falklands conflict in 1982.

As a teenager he was arrested when he was in a stolen car with two or three other males aged between 18 and 27.

Mr Weston always said he was not aware the care was stolen, but on advice, pleased guilty at the subsequent trial.

He was fined £30 and put on probation for three months.
