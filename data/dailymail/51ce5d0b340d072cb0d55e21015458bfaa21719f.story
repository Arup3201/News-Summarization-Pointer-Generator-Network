Experts fear the deadly disease threatening to devastate 80 million ash trees may have now spread to privately-owned gardens for the first time.

At least two likely cases of the killer fungus have been discovered in back gardens and they have now been referred to plant inspectors for confirmation.

Until now, ash dieback has been confined to Forestry Commission land, commercial plantings and nursery stock. In total, it has been confirmed at 200 sites, including 116 in mature woodlands.

The microscopic fungus - chalara fraxinea - is rife across mainland Europe. Experts now fear the disease will be more catastrophic than Dutch Elm Disease which killed 25 million trees here in the 1970s and 80s.

Scientists believe the disease has been present in British woodland for at least two years, arriving through wind-blown spores from northern France and Belgium.

As the tiny spores are transported on the breeze, it is virtually impossible to eradicate, and potential outbreaks in domestic trees will be grim news for gardeners.

Homeowners worried that an ash tree on their land is infected should visit the Forestry Commission website, which has pictures and videos advising how to spot the disease.

There is no known cure, but older trees will take years to die. The current advice is not to cut down an infected mature tree, but it is important to manage the leaf litter, as it is how the fungus spreads.

Gardeners should attempt to dispose of the leaves within their own property, preferably on a bonfire, rather than transporting them elsewhere which may help spread the disease.

Toby Hammond, from the University of East Anglia, is behind the ashtag.org project, which allows the public to report suspected cases of the disease.

These are then analysed by experts, with the most likely cases reported to Defra.

After looking at thousands of images, the teams has identified 45 suspected sites, including one in west London.

‘We have received hundreds of reports over the past couple of weeks and we have had experts examining them to identity those that are likely to be Chalara,’ said Mr Hammond.

'We have so far identified 45 sites that are likely to have the disease.'

‘Two of these seem like they have been found in back gardens, but they all must now need to be confirmed by the plant health inspectors from Defra.

‘I suspect trees have been infected for some time and it could have arrived here up to five years ago which would explain why it is now so widespread.

‘I would urge the public to look at the guidance and take pictures of any suspicious leaves or trees and send them into us.’

More than 100,000 ash saplings have been destroyed in recent weeks, while the import and movement of trees has also been banned.

Among those facing the unhappy task of destroying young plantings is broadcaster Selena Scott, who planted a wood at her Yorkshire farm as part of the Jubilee celebrations earlier this year.

She is set to lose 5,000 ash amid concerns they are infected with the deadly fungus.

‘I have been in touch with the Woodland Trust and they are very concerned and will be advising me next week but from what they know of my situation they say the picture looks grim.’ The 61-year-old told the Sunday Telegraph.

A common ash tree: The first confirmed case in the UK was in March 2012, and since then, dieback has been confirmed at a further 200 sites, with woodlands in Norfolk, Suffolk, Kent and Essex among the worst affected

‘It’s devastating. The nursery where I bought the saplings seem unable to tell me whether they came from Holland or not but I fear anyway that I will have to cut them all down and dig up the roots.

‘That’s the message the conservationists are giving out. Can you imagine what a heartache that will be?’

A spokesman for Defra tonight said that none of the 200 confirmed cases were in private gardens.

She said: ‘Our efforts are best placed concentrating on tackling the disease. If any cases are confirmed their place of origin will also be confirmed.’
