Brits drink too much, have bad eating habits, are ignorant, intolerant and too nationalistic, a survey of foreigners has found.

People overseas are none too keen on UK weather or food either, however it is a relief that they think people from the United Kingdom are still very polite.

The poll carried out for the British Council found politeness and good manners are the best characteristics of British people, who are also seen as educated and skilled.

Boozy: Foreigners see Brits as hard-drinking, ignorant and intolerant, a British Council survey has found

Its report, As Others See Us, was based on responses by more than 5,000 people aged 18 to 34 in Brazil, China, Germany, India and the U.S.

Asked for their views on people in the UK, those surveyed put drinking too much as the worst characteristic, followed by bad eating habits, ignorance of other cultures, too nationalistic and intolerance toward people from other countries.

On the plus side, 46 per cent put politeness and good manners as the best characteristic, while 37 per cent reckoned Britons are educated and skilled, 31 per cent saw them as friendly, 27 per cent said they respected the rule of law and 25 per cent said they had a good sense of humour.

When asked to name a person they were interested in and associate with UK arts and culture, young people overseas most commonly came up William Shakespeare, followed by the Queen and David Beckham. 

Former England international David Beckham is one of Britain's most recognisable figures to foreigners

Head of state: Along with Beckham, the Queen is seen as the face of Britain, according to foreigners surveyed by the British Council

The name that came up most commonly when young foreigners were asked to name a person they were interested in and associate with UK arts and culture was William Shakespeare

Here are the negative characteristics foreigners associate with Brits:

Drink too much alcohol (27% thought so)

Bad eating habits (23%)

Too nationalistic (22%)

Ignorant of other cultures (22%)

Intolerant towards people from other countries (20%)

Rude (17%)

Unfriendly (13%)

Complain too much (13%)

Too pessimistic (11%)

Lazy (10%)

Other names familiar to foreigners were Adele, the Beatles, Paul McCartney and Elton John, while JK Rowling, Banksy, Tracy Emin and Winston Churchill.

Culture and history were seen as the UK's most attractive features, with weather and food its least.

A wider survey that included young adults in Britain as well as the other five countries showed that, in terms of overall 'attractiveness', the UK was ranked second only to the USA, sharing joint second place with Australia.

With respondents not permitted to rate their own country, France was in fourth place and Italy fifth.

British Council strategy director John Worne said: 'This research confirms culture and education are among the UK's biggest assets in attracting people from important countries to the UK's future.

'But, while there's a lot to be proud of, some stereotypes still colour the way that we're viewed overseas.' 

In the report's foreword, chairman Vikki Heywood said: 'As a nation, our influence today and in the future can be well served by aspiring to be one of the most attractive countries globally - sharing the best of our culture and values with people around the world and learning from the values and cultures of others.

'I am delighted to introduce this new research that gives us an indication of how we are viewed in the world and provides many lessons to support our aspirations for increased global influence.'
