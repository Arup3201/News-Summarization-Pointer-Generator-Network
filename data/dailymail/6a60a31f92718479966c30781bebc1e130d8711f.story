Two players who look set to remain at Liverpool beyond January are misfiring forwards Rickie Lambert and Mario Balotelli.

There had been suggestion of Lambert leaving on loan given his failure to break into the side but the Reds are not looking to offload the Scouser.

Balotelli, though, could be on his way were any definite interest to materialise.

The club are yet to receive any approach for the Italian, despite reports in his homeland that Greek side Olympiacos had offered to take him on loan.

Liverpool are also still in the market for an experienced goalkeeper but their pursuit of a new No1 to replace Simon Mignolet will wait until the summer.

Manchester City’s James Milner remains their top outfield target and they are confident that the lure of guaranteed first-team football will see him move to Merseyside.

Meanwhile, Fabio Borini’s £14million price-tag makes him too expensive for any potential suitors, while talks are ongoing with Lille over releasing loanee Divock Origi this month, although that would cost Liverpool £5m.

Everton failed with a late bid for Bayern Munich’s Xherdan Shaqiri.

Sportsmail can reveal that the Toffees attempted to bring the Switzerland winger to Goodison Park before he agreed to join Inter Milan.

The 23-year-old instead heads to the San Siro on loan before completing a £12m move at the end of the season.

Everton boss Roberto Martinez will now redouble his efforts to bring in reinforcements in a bid to save his side’s season.

Blackpool pair Dom Telford and Mark Waddington have rejected the club’s offer of £200-per-week deals.

As a result, chairman Karl Oyston has told them they will be sent to play with the youth team unless they accept.

This has alerted a host of Championship clubs and their scouts will be in attendance should the highly rated pair turn out for the youth side against Oldham on Saturday.

West Brom will listen to offers for record signing Brown Ideye, as well as striker Victor Anichebe.

Ideye arrived for £10m from Dynamo Kiev in the summer but has failed to impact – scoring just once in the Premier League - and could now be headed out of The Hawthorns.

Anichebe, meanwhile, has found first-team opportunities limited this season and, after just four goals in 18 months since his £6m arrival from Everton, his days at the club look to be numbered.

Wolfsburg sporting director Klaus Allofs has distanced his club from a £23m move for Chelsea’s Andre Schurrle, although there is interest.

World Cup winner Schurrle has fallen out of favour under Jose Mourinho at Stamford Bridge and they would be keen to cash in on the player who cost them £18m when he signed from Leverkusen in 2013.

Wolfsburg could be holding out for a lower price.

Tottenham are keen on a loan deal for PSG midfielder Adrien Rabiot.

The 19-year-old is considered one of the brightest prospects in France and could act as cover for Nabil Bentaleb, who is away at the Africa Cup of Nations with Algeria.
