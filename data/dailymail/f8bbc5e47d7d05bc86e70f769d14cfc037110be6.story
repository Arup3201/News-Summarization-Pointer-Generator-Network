A major traffic route into a city centre was closed today following warnings of high winds, two years after a man died in the area during similar conditions.

Leeds City Council took the decision to shut the road past the Bridgewater Place tower - the tallest building in Yorkshire - after predictions that wind speeds in the area could reach 75mph.

But with pedestrians still allowed access, at around 11am today two
people were injured in the area by the gusts - including a woman in her 30s who was knocked unconscious.

The move follows a recommendation made yesterday by a coroner at the inquest into the death of Edward Slaney, 35, who was hit by a lorry that flew through the air in windy conditions in March 2011.

Danger: Pedestrians are battered by high winds in the notorious Bridgewater Place in Leeds, West Yorkshire

Following a lengthy inquest which examined the 367ft tower's influence on wind conditions in the area, Leeds Deputy Coroner Melanie Williamson said she was recommending the junction at its base should be shut to all road users when wind speeds reach 45mph.

Leeds City Council said it was closing the junction - which is said to become a 'man-made wind tunnel' in storms - at 6am until the winds subside.

The road is the main route into Leeds from the south and links the city centre and railways stations to the M1, M621 and M62 motorways.

It is used by thousands of vehicles every morning and its closure is expected to cause widespread traffic chaos in the area.

In a statement, the council said: ‘People are being warned to plan ahead to avoid possible major disruption around Bridgewater Place tomorrow morning as roads will be closed due to expected exceptionally-high winds.

‘Leeds City Council will shut the 
junction where Yorkshire's tallest building stands due to the forecasts 
of high winds of up to 75mph.

‘No vehicles or cycles will be allowed along Victoria Road, Water Lane or Neville Street from around 6am until wind speeds drop to lower levels. A high-sided vehicle diversion at the junction will also be in place from midnight tonight.’

The council's director of development, Martin Farrington, said: ‘Given the high winds forecast and the known risk caused by Bridgewater Place we will close the roads around the building tomorrow.

‘We appreciate the traffic disruption that this will cause, but these are exceptionally strong winds and we have to consider the safety of all road users.’

‘While we need to take time to examine the coroner's recommendations we would have had to close the junction tomorrow anyway due to the weather forecast.

‘We apologise for the inconvenience and ask people who will be travelling in this area of the city to plan ahead.’

A
 Yorkshire Ambulance Service spokesman said of the injuries: ‘We 
received two calls within minutes of each other this morning at 
Bridgewater Place. The first call came in at 10.57am.

‘A female in her 30s had been blown over and knocked unconscious. We sent a rapid response team and an ambulance to the scene.

‘Just minutes later we received another call about another person who had suffered injuries at the same place. We sent another ambulance and both people have been taken to Leeds General Infirmary.’

Nicola Furbisher, who witnessed the winds on her way to work, said on Twitter: ‘People barely able to stay upright, being flung into the road, mum battling as pushchair is almost blown over. Very scary.’

And Richard Edwards added: ‘I've never seen wind like this before. Two men in high-viz jackets have just saved a woman from being blown into the road.’

Dr Slaney died when the truck was lifted off the road by a gust of wind. The driver said the vehicle flew like a hot air balloon.

The inquest into his death heard how a series of wind-related incidents had been reported at the north end of the tower in the years before the incident.

The company that owns the building, which was opened in 2007 and dominates the south Leeds skyline, is planning a range of measures to try to alleviate the problem including large gantries over the road.

But Dr Slaney's family and the coroner have expressed their frustration at the pace at which this measures are being implemented.
