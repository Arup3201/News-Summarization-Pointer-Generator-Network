With her honey-streaked blonde locks, unlined skin and sweet smile, Sheri Winkelmann, an actress and playwright, looks years younger than her real age of 51.

But it's possible that her preternaturally youthful looks are the result not of good skincare but the famous maxim: 'you're only as old as the man you feel'.

And for Sheri, that means very young indeed. Her boyfriend of just over a year, up-and-coming actor Desmond Huey, is just 26 years old.

Happy couple: 'Cougar' Sheri Winkelmann, 51, with Desmond Huey, 26, her boyfriend of just over a year

Now the couple are to appear on TLC documentary, Extreme Cougar Wives, which explores what life is like when your other half is young enough to be your son.

And for Sheri, life with Desmond is so good, she wouldn't change a single thing. 'It's been about 15 months and it's going good,' she says of her relationship.

'He's a very unusual young man and he's very mature for his age. I feel I have a trusted equal partner and he's never ever done anything to drive me up the wall!'

Wonderful though her other half is, she admits there have been moments where others haven't been quite so understanding.

'I do wonder whether people are reacting to the age difference or the fact that we're black and white,' she muses.

Perfect match: Sheri says shared values and Desmond's maturity are the secret of their relationship

Open-minded: Sheri says women should be more accepting of love that comes in an unconventional package

'But there has been no real opposition. Perhaps it would be an issue if we were living in an all-white town in the countryside but here in Chicago, people are more open minded.'

The couple, who first met more than two years ago at a conference in Palm Springs, were friends for 12 months before Desmond finally made his move.

'I think it [the relationship] works because of our shared value system,' she explains. 'Obviously having children is a big issue but he's not ready so not an issue yet.

'What's different is that we really love each other in the purest sense, so we will do what's best for each other even if that means not being together.'

Despite acknowledging the potential pitfalls, Sheri thinks its time women stopped fixating on age and opened themselves up to relationships with men they might not have considered.

Confidence: According to Sheri, in order to catch your own dream man, feeling happy with yourself is key

'I never like to be limited by a label,' she explains. 'Cougar doesn't necessarily have the most positive connotations but people should open up to love, 
and if comes in form of someone younger, then don't dismiss it.

'Before meeting Desmond, I had
 rejected the idea of dating someone younger but he just wore me down.

'I would tell other women to 
trust their insticts and go with the flow - love comes in all kinds of odd packages.'

Sheri and Desmond appear in Extreme Cougar Wives on TLC, Tuesdays at 10pm

'These are the only things that work,' explains Sheri. 'I got my heart smashed lots of times in the past but I learned!'

LOVE YOURSELF

'It's kind of like when you go to bank and they turn you down for loans. When you have money, you get the loan, and when you don't, you don't. Love yourself and other people will too.'

BE YOURSELF

'Be proud of who you are and don't be afraid to own your age, weight, experience in life... I feel much more secure now. I was such an insecure mess when younger and it's not attractive.

RELAX

'Let the guy show you who he is. Sometimes women so want to be partnered, that it all becomes too much so give him time to come to you and show you who he really is.'

DON'T LOSE SIGHT OF YOUR OWN VALUE

'Don't give away more than willing to lose. Remember that you are valuable and let him work to please you. He
 will be happiest when he's able to make you happy so don't give it all 
away and make him work for it.

REMEMBER YOU'RE A GODDESS

'Let him serve you and don't go running after him. 
He gets to be a hero if you let him do for you. Also, men don't want to be with 
women who don't need them, so let him know he's wanted and needed, even if it's just in small ways.
