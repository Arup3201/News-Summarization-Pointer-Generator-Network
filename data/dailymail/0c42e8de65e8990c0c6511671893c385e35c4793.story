Former Labour Chancellor Alistair Darling said the party had to 'set out the parameters' of spending plans this year

Ed Miliband must spell out his economic plans this year if he wants voters to trust Labour with the nation’s finances, Alistair Darling said yesterday.

The former Chancellor warned Britain risks a decade of ‘bumping along the bottom’, and Labour needs to set out a credible ‘direction of travel’.

Mr Darling said the party must come clean about what it would spend in 2015/16 once the Government’s spending review is completed on June 26.

Mr Darling said: ‘We won’t know the baseline of the Government’s spending limits until the June spending review. But we will during the course of this year have to set out the parameters.’

The Labour grandee added the party was already spelling out detailed spending plans two years before the 1997 election to ‘establish in the  public’s mind what our priorities were . . . So  people can see your direction of travel.’

He warned voters need to see plans for growth. ‘My fear is we could be bumping along the bottom for an entire decade if not longer,’ he said.

Mr Darling spoke out as Labour MP Frank Field called for a ‘U-turn’ on welfare to please Labour voters dissatisfied with welfare handouts.

He said: ‘I think what we need to do is set out the sort of welfare state and the level of benefits we would be willing to pay for.

‘It would be the biggest U-turn we’ve done on the strategy that we employed over the period of the last Labour government.’

But challenged over why he thought Mr Miliband was not doing better – with the Labour lead down to single digits in some polls – Mr Darling offered only faint praise.

‘I think that Ed has been a lot more successful than people gave him credit for when he was first appointed,’ he told journalists at a lunch in Westminster.

Spending: With less than two years before the general election, Ed Miliband and Ed Balls are under pressure to say what they would do with the nation's finances

Mr Darling, who had running battles 
with Gordon Brown during the dying days of the Labour government, also 
refused to be drawn on the tense relationship with his former friend.

Asked
how many times they had spoken since Mr Brown was forced out of Downing
Street three years ago, Mr Darling suggested it was few, if any. He 
said: 'I have never provided a running commentary on any conversations I
may or may not have had.'

This week there has been renewed speculation that Mr Balls could be moved from the Treasury brief ahead of the election.

Mr Darking is fronting the Better Together campaign against Scottish independence, which will be wound up after the referendum in autumn next year.

Asked if he would like a return to the Labour frontbench, Mr Darling suggested the backbenches were not for him, adding: ‘At the moment I am totally focussed on the referendum between now and October 2014 and after that I will see where I stand.’ He promised to ‘maintain an interest in wider affairs’ .

During a wide ranging speech, Mr Darling set out an alternative economic plan, backing a third runway at Heathrow, calling for more housebuilding and rejecting the idea of privatising the nationalised banks too soon

He warned that five years after the financial crisis which began on his watch, there was little sign of improvement with the Tories forced to take comfort from not falling into a triple dip recession.

‘My fear is we could be bumping along the
bottom for an entire decade if not longer - look at what happened in 
Japan,’ Mr Darling said. He blamed a ‘lack of confidence’ among 
businesses.

Tense relations: Asked how many times he had spoken to Gordon Brown since leaving power in 2010, Mr Darling said only that he would not provide a 'running commentary

In the Budget this year the government announced a £130billion mortgage guarantee scheme to kickstart the housing market.

But Mr Darling warned it risked creating a new housing bubble because it will force up prices without increasing supply of homes.

‘The risk is if you put in measures which make it easier to buy… but you don’t do anything about the supply of housing you simply put the prices up. We have enough experience in this country of what bubbles can do.

‘I would have preferred if George Osborne had done something more to speed up the supply of housing rather than doing something which will undoubtedly make some people feel better.

‘I think the result is if you look at London where people struggle to rent and to buy, simply putting more money into the system after an existing stock seems to me to be asking for trouble.’

He added that the South East of England we need extra runway capacity, and defied Mr Miliband;s policy to back the idea of Heathrow expansion.

He said Boris Johnson’s plan for a new airport in the Thames Estuary is a ‘complete nonsense’.
