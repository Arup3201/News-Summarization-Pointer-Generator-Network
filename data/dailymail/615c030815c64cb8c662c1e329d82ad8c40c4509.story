Roberto Martinez has declared that he knew Ross Barkley was a 'superstar' from just an hour into the first game of the season.

The Everton boss told The Sun that he knew the 20-year-old was a special player from the moment he capped a superb display in their opening day draw against Norwich with a stunning 25-yard finish.

Barkley went on to make a further 34 Premier League appearances this season, scoring six goals, and his performances have earned him a place in Roy Hodgson's squad for this summer's World Cup in Brazil.

‘Ross is a superstar in our eyes already so for us nothing will change the perception of him,' said Martinez.

‘When he scored the goal at Norwich away from home, that’s when we saw he was a star.

‘For someone to play the amount of games he did and produce the performances he had against the top teams - if you analyse Ross’s season it’s been against the best when he’s excelled.’

And he added: ‘Remember he could be in a position to impress millions never mind just the people in England. That’s the type of tournament we are talking about.’
