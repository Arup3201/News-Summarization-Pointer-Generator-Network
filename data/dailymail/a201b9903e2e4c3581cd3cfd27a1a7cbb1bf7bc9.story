Iran claims to have successfully copied a U.S. drone it captured in December 2011, with state television broadcasting - and even the country's supreme leader tweeting - images of the replicated aircraft.

Tehran captured the US RQ-170 Sentinel in 2011 while it was in its airspace, reportedly on a mission to spy on the country's nuclear sites.

At the time, U.S. military officials 
tried to play down the incident, saying Iran did not have the technology
 to decipher its secrets, and President Barack Obama asked the Islamic 
republic to return the Sentinel to no avail.

But a military officer said in footage, released Sunday, that they had cracked the code.

Tweet: Iran said on Sunday it has succeeded in copying a U.S. drone it captured in December 2011, with state television broadcasting - and even the country's supreme leader tweeting - images apparently showing the replicated aircraft

'Our 
engineers succeeded in breaking the drone's secrets and copying them. It
 will soon take a test flight,' the officer said in a move that will 
likely appear threatening to Washington. 

The
 broadcast showed supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's visit to an 
exhibition organized by the powerful Revolutionary Guards air wing about
 Iran's military advances, particularly regarding ballistic missiles and
 drones. The leader later tweeted a photo of the drone.

Footage showed two nearly identical drones.

'This drone is very important for reconnaissance missions,' Khamenei said, standing in front of the Iranian copy of the American unmanned aircraft.

Iran said it had taken control of the ultra hi-tech drone and forced it down in the desert where it was recovered nearly intact. Washington said it had lost control of the aircraft.

Iran has been working to develop a significant drone programme of its own, and some of its unmanned aircraft have a range of hundreds of miles and are armed with missiles.

The state broadcaster also showed images that the commentary said had been recorded by an Iranian drone above a U.S. aircraft carrier in the Gulf.

In the pictures, which were relatively clear, it was possible to see American personnel working on planes and helicopters aboard the vessel.

Meanwhile, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Sunday that Western expectations for the Islamic Republic to limit its missile program were 'stupid and idiotic.'

The Supreme Leader also called on the country's Revolutionary Guards to mass-produce missiles.

The United States and its allies have said they are worried about Iran's missile program as they fear the weapons could carry nuclear warheads. Iran has long denied having any plans to develop atomic weapons.

'They expect us to limit our missile program while they constantly threaten Iran with military action. So this is a stupid, idiotic expectation,' Khamenei was quoted as telling the IRNA news agency while on a visit to an aeronautics fair by the Revolutionary Guards.

'The revolutionary guards should definitely carry out their program and not be satisfied with the present level. They should mass produce. This is a main duty of all military officials,' Khamenei said.
