A history enthusiast has had a tattoo depicting D-Day inked across his entire back.

Jason Purnell, from Bristol, chose the huge work - featuring tanks, soldiers and a large Spitfire plane - to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the landings.

The 27-year-old spent £1,600 on the tattoo, which took almost an entire year to complete.

He told the Sun: 'My family are all very excited about my tattoo - we have a real interest in Second World War history.'

D-Day, or the day of the Normandy Landings on June 6, 1944, marked the start of the European invasion during the Second World War.

Thousands of allied troops landed on the beaches in Northern France initiating the effort to liberate mainland Europe from Nazi occupation.

In total 75,215 British and Canadian troops and 57,500 US troops were landed by sea on D-Day.

Another 23,400 were landed by air – it was the largest seaborne invasion in history.

Mr Purnell's tattoo also features the date of the Normandy landings - codenamed Operation Overlord  - inkings portraying German defences, a Higgins boat, and a bright red poppy.

The 70th anniversary of the amphibious assault on June 6 1944 will be marked with events on several of the Normandy beaches, but commemorations will also pay tribute to the British paratroopers who lost their lives.

Many of the airborne troops who died in the historic operation are buried at Ranville, the first French village to be liberated after the D-Day landings.

Many of the men buried at Ranville died in Operation Tonga - the codename for the airborne operation undertaken by the British 6th Airborne Division between June 5 and 7 1944.

During the assault, paratroopers and glider-borne troops landed on the eastern flank of the invasion area, near to the French city of Caen.

In total 75,215 British and Canadian troops and 57,500 US troops were landed by sea on D-Day. Another 23,400 were landed by air ¿ it was the largest seaborne invasion in history

Their aim was to capture two strategically-vital bridges over the Caen canal and Orne River - one the now-famous Pegasus Bridge, as well as to destroy some other bridges and secure several important villages.

The troops were plagued by a combination of bad weather and poor navigation which caused many of them to be dropped inaccurately.

But despite the problems, they successfully assaulted the Merville gun battery; secured the two bridges; destroyed others; and liberated a number of towns and villages, including Ranville.
