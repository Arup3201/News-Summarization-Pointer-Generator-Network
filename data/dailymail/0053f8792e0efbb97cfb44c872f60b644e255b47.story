A stand-in male stripper lost his temper when he was heckled by his female audience, lashing out and pulling one woman's hair out in clumps - while his trousers were around his ankles.

First-timer Leon Zbudowskyj, 30, was a last minute replacement for a regular stripper called Fabio at the £10-a-head, ladies-only night at the Baltic Inn, near Llanelli.

But he failed to excite the crowd, and when more than 200 disappointed women started booing the 'scrawny' striptease artist, pelting him with paper napkins, he flew into a rage.

Swansea Crown Court heard how Zbudowskyj, of Caerleon, Newport, had a few drinks to calm his nerves before changing into his fireman’s outfit in the men's lavatory at the pub.

Prosecutor Brian Simpson said: 
'Zbudowskyj was booked to work as a stripper for a ladies night but he 
turned up after he’d been drinking.

'He used the gents toilet as a changing room and the compere, Deborah Jones, saw him pull his trousers down.

'On stage he started spitting cream at the members of the audience - the audience began to boo and throw serviettes at him.'

The court heard Mrs Jones described the novice stripper, who was taken offstage by manager David Morgan and told he was no longer welcome, as like 'a rabbit caught in a car's headlights'.

The prosecutor said: 'He appeared agitated and aggressive - he still had his trousers down when he lunged at Mr Morgan, punching him to the side of the head.

'There was a struggle, and Zbudowskyj threw a beer glass at him, grabbed him by the face, and tried to gouge his eyes.

'He bit Mr Morgan on the chest, and he was only released when he managed to twist his body away.'

The court heard he then went on to attack the compere and a member of the audience.

Five police cars were sent to break up the scuffle, and Zbudowskyj was arrested and driven away still wearing his fireman’s outfit.

Zbudowskyj denied assault and claimed he himself had been attacked at the bar in Pontyates near Llanelli, West Wales.

Zbudowskyj smiled in court today as the events of the night in January last year were related.

Mr Simpson said: 'Mrs Jones described Zbudowskyj as being liked a caged animal, and he lunged at her, causing her £154 glasses to break.

'A woman in the audience, Bethan Lewis, went to the gents toilet after seeing the fuss but Zbudowskyj grabbed her by the hair, pulling clumps of it out.'

Zbudowskyj had admitted three charges of common assault and one of damaging the glasses at an earlier hearing.

Today the court heard he had 11 previous offences of violence and had once smashed up a flat before running naked through a town centre.

Psychiatrist Dr Stephen Attwood told the court that Zbudowskyj was suffering from a mental disorder which 'can be treated'.

Judge Keith Thomas, who made Zbudowskyj the subject of a mental health order committing him to a hospital without time limit, said: 'When he loses control of himself he behaves in an uncontrollable fashion.

'It’s only a matter of luck he has not caused serious injury to members of the public through his uncontrollable outbursts.'

Fabio later appeared at the club for free to make up for the women’s disappointment.
