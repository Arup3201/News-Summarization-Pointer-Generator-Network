If the adornments to Moeen Ali’s left wrist have been causing flutters at the ICC, it was the stuff propelled by his right one that briefly did for the Indians in Southampton on Tuesday.

While the world of cricket was having its say on the rights and wrongs of the ‘Save Gaza’ and ‘Free Palestine’ wristbands worn by Moeen on Monday, the man himself was busy profiting from the tourists’ apparent urge to self-destruct on the third afternoon of this south coast slow-burner.

Moeen is very much England’s fifth bowler, an off-spinner so tantalisingly poised between frontline and part-time that Alastair Cook doesn’t seem sure how to handle him. To judge by events either side of tea, the confusion had spread to India’s middle order.

In the penultimate over before the break, the supremely gifted Rohit Sharma took leave of his senses — as he has been known to in the past — and drove Moeen straight to Stuart Broad at mid-off.

Then, in the third over after tea, Ajinkya Rahane spoiled the effect of a gutsy half-century by top- edging an inviting long hop straight to midwicket. From 210 for four, India — a nation that traditionally produces some of the world’s best players of spin — were 217 for six, still 359 behind.

Moeen’s brief England career has already raised the possibility of an identity crisis. Is he the master of self-denial who almost saved a Test by himself against Sri Lanka, or the flighty No 6 with an issue against the short ball? And are his  off-breaks designed to hold up an end — or take wickets?

Some of the names among his 12 Test victims so far suggest the part-time tag is too hastily applied. He has removed Sri Lanka’s Kumar Sangakkara twice, plus five of India’s top eight on show in this Test. As for chips to mid-off and miscued half-trackers, didn’t Shane Warne take the occasional wicket with a bad ball?

‘He picked up a couple of freakish wickets,’ said Stuart Broad. ‘But that was off the pressure he developed. And he was unlucky not to have Ajinkya Rahane caught down the leg side. Hopefully the wicket will deteriorate in the second innings, and Moeen could be a bit of a handful.

‘We’ve been so fortunate having Graeme Swann play over 60 Tests for us. When you’re playing with him, perhaps you don’t realise what role he played. But Moeen’s developing every game as a spin bowler.’

England will miss Swann for a while yet, and Moeen’s misfortune has been to invite unfair comparisons with his country’s greatest modern off-spinner. But Swann would have settled for Moeen’s spell either side of tea of  12-0-33-2.

The jury may be out on Moeen’s batting, if only because he keeps getting in a tangle against the bouncer. But his off-breaks are getting into a groove. And if that means the odd lucky break, Swann would definitely approve.
