Marine biologist Forrest Galante has swam with some of the most fearsome creatures in the sea, including the terrifying hammerhead.

But now he has hitched a ride on the whale shark, which can grow to more than 44ft long. However, despite its massive size, the whale shark is a filter feeder, devouring tonnes of plankton as it swims though warm parts of the ocean.

Despite the mammoth size of the whale shark, Galante said he had no fears about diving with the creatures, which can live to between 70 and 100 years old in the wild. 

Forrest Galante was helping marine biologists study the giant whale shark off the coast of

He said: 'Not at all, they are gentle giants. I was helping out a team of marine biologists conduct a survey on whale shark population estimates, to identify returning sharks year on year and to see growth rates of individuals.

'We were out for three days on the whole and it was on the first evening that I was able to have such an amazing interaction with the largest shark.'

The project is taking place at a secret location off the coast of Mexico.  

Galante has appeared on several reality TV survival-style shows in the United States. 

He added: 'I have previously been in the water with the hammerhead along with various other sharks.

'As my passion and job revolves around amazing wildlife, I continue to seek encounters (both in the water and out) with all the most fantastic creatures I can.'

Unlike species such as the great white and tiger shark, the whale shark is very docile in the water and filters its food. 

Biologists do not know why the whale shark has any teeth as it does not use them for feeding, although they are thought to have evolved more than 90 million years ago.

Whale sharks can live for between 70 and 100 years in the wild and reach sexual maturity after 30 years
