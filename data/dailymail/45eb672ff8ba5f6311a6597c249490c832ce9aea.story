A Milwaukee woman has been charged with drink driving after being caught riding a motorcycle ‘with no hands’ on Friday afternoon.

Police witnessed the woman drive right past them, her jacket was unzipped she had nothing on underneath and she was screaming at passing cars.

Footage filmed on the police car’s dash 
camera shows the women adopting a Christ-like pose on the back of the 
bike as she weaved in and out of the traffic.

A deputy can be heard saying, 'She's screaming at every car on the freeway and kind of assaulting people with her motorcycle.' 

The cops then pursued her for several miles northbound along Interstate 43 while she drove at 57 miles per hour. 

Bayside Police Department had to request additional assistance from other squads to help stop traffic as the woman drove ‘all over the road’ with little concern for the safety of herself or others.

At one point she slowed down until she was doing 10 miles per hour in a 65 speed zone, but once she had adjusted the bike she accelerated off again.

The pursuit eventually ended when the women lost control of the vehicle in middle of the highway and police rushed to her assistance

As well as being over the legal alcohol limit, police believe the woman was high on prescription drugs

The pursuit eventually ended in Mequon, when the women lost control of the vehicle in middle of the highway.

Police rushed to her assistance, she was described as ‘clearly out of it’ and 'stammering about religion.'

Miraculously her only injury following her crash was a cut on her chin.

As well as being over the legal alcohol limit, police believe the woman was high on prescription drugs. This is the second time she has been arrested on a drink driving offense.
