A couple who placed a dead baby in a bucket filled with concrete claim they were preserving the body for a memorial.

Matthew and Krystal Scroggs, from Pleasant Hill, Missouri, say the baby was stillborn at five months and that they were waiting for her to recover from the birth to hold a burial.

Mr Scroggs, 28, has now been arrested and charged with abandonment of a corpse.

Father: Matthew Scroggs, has been charged with abandonment of corpse after police found the body of a baby boy encased in concrete in his home

Cass County police responded to a report claiming that the Scroggs was in possession of a stolen car and used drugs.

They
had also been tipped off that Mrs Scroggs had given birth in early October
and that the child had died and evidence would be found in a plastic 
tote.

Police found 
the stolen vehicle and after taking Mr Scroggs in for questioning they 
received permission from him to search their home.

Upon their search, they found a blue plastic bucket containing the remains of a male infant encased in concrete.

After initially denying that his wife 
had been pregnant, Mr Scroggs admitted that Krystal had delivered a 
stillborn boy at five months which he then put in the blue bucket and 
filled with concrete.

Crime scene: Police were called to the home in Pleasant Hill, Missouri after a report of a stolen vehicle, drug use and a tip about the baby boy in the bucket

Tragedy: The Scroggs, who already have four children, claim the baby was stillborn at five months

Defense: Mrs Scroggs claim her husband put the baby's body in the concrete to preserve it until she was strong enough to build a memorial for the stillborn child

Mrs Scroggs, who has four children with her husband, says she saw no reason to call 911 after her alleged miscarriage and that she had been mentally preparing to build a memorial with her husband.

‘The only reason my baby was not in the ground and my husband is being accused of abandonment of a corpse is because I begged my husband to wait until I was healthy enough and strong enough to finish it (the memorial) hand-in-hand with him together,’ Mrs Scroggs told FOX 4.

Mr Scroggs has been charged and will appear in court in December as they await autopsy results to determine if the child was stillborn or died outside the womb.

‘I don’t care what anybody’s opinion is, I don’t care what you guys think,’ Mrs Scroggs added.

‘I never abandoned and I never have and I never will.’
