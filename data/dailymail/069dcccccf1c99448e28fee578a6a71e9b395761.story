Before any one could alert the driver, the pensioner was hit to the ground and dragged under the rear wheels

Before any one had the chance to intervene, the pensioner was knocked to the ground and dragged under the rear wheels of the vehicle.

But instead of stopping, Ms Ilyina started to accelerate backwards - as she thought she had got wedged on a speed bump.

She only stopped when startled passers-by shouted at her to stop.

Pensioner Milena Blinova was taken to hospital and is recovering from leg fractures and bruising

Ms Ilyina, 37, explained: 'I didn't see her at all but as I was going back I felt the car bump onto something.

'I thought it was a speed hump or a pothole so I accelerated to try to get over it.'

Police spokesman Dmitry Evseyev said: 'It was not any one person's fault. We have had words with the driver about her need to take more care, but there are no charges.'
