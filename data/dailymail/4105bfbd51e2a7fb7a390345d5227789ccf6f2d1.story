It was one of the most audacious plans of the Second World War.

A crack SAS team was ordered on a death-or-glory mission to kill or capture one of the Nazis’ finest commanders at a French chateau in 1944.

Snatching Field Marshal Erwin Rommel would be an ‘immense’ propaganda coup, the elite British soldiers preparing for the operation were told.

However, the raid was abandoned hours before the four-man unit parachuted in. Rommel was forced to return to Germany after being badly injured when his car was hit by the RAF.

The SAS War Diary 1941-45 includes first-hand reports from the special forces unit's disastrous first operation in November 1941, from which only 22 of the 65 soldiers who took part returned. Pictured, SAS founder Sir David Stirling poses with some of his soldiers in their desert jeeps

Details of the daring plot have been 
disclosed for the first time in an extraordinary diary recording the 
remarkable early exploits of the Special Air Service. The secret tome, 
kept under lock and key since being compiled in 1946, has been published
in an effort to raise tens of thousands of pounds for UK special forces
troops – including dozens maimed in Afghanistan – bereaved families and
veterans.

The 600-page limited edition volume, 
weighing 25lb and bound in leather ‘liberated’ from the Nazis, has been 
authorised to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the regiment. Only 
1,000 copies have been printed, with prices starting at £975.

‘The SAS War Diary 1941-45’ collects 
rare and previously undisclosed photographs, top secret orders, 
first-hand accounts and reports – many written by SAS founder David 
Stirling – documenting the ‘Who Dares Wins’ regiment’s missions during 
the Second World War.

Newly released secret SAS records feature the succinct orders for an ambitious but unsuccessful mission to 'kill, or kidnap and remove to England' German commander Field Marshal Erwin Rommel (seen here in the African desert) in France in 1944

Among the officers mentioned in the 
journal is Paddy Mayne who led a number of audacious night raids and 
became one of Britain’s most decorated soldiers.

One of the most daring plots was the 
strike against Rommel shortly after D-Day. A July 1944 order marked 
‘Secret’ states: ‘The following points should be borne in mind: If it 
should prove possible to kidnap Rommel and bring him to this country the
propaganda value would be immense and the inevitable retaliation 
against the local inhabitants might be mitigated or avoided. Such a plan
could involve finding and being prepared to hold for a short time if 
necessary a suitable landing ground.

‘To kill Rommel would obviously be 
easier than to kidnap him and it is preferable to ensure the former 
rather than to attempt and fail in the latter.’ The order added: 
‘Kidnapping would require successful two-way W/T [walkie-talkie] 
communication and therefore a larger party, while killing could be 
reported by pigeon.’

Rommel may have escaped the SAS’s 
clutches but he committed suicide three months later after being 
implicated in a failed attempt to assassinate Hitler.

Document: The original order for Operation Squatter, the regiment's first major mission

Sir David Stirling was captured by the Germans but escaped only to be re-captured by the Italians before being sent to Colditz Castle

The SAS was conceived as a commando 
force to operate in secrecy behind enemy lines. Stirling, a brave young 
officer, dreamed up the revolutionary tactic of using small, elite, 
highly-skilled units to tip the balance of the war in North Africa in 
Britain’s favour.

The first mission – known as 
‘Operation Number One’ – took place on 16 November 1941. The aim was to 
destroy squadrons of German and Italian aircraft based at two airstrips 
in Libya. The operational order noted: ‘It is most important that the 
enemy should be unaware of your having landed or of your presence.’

One SAS soldier, Parachutist Bennett, 
wrote that before setting off the commandos were given a meal ‘fit for a
king... just like having whatever you wished before going to the 
gallows’. But horrendous weather conditions meant the operation ended in
disaster.

One plane was shot down, killing all 
aboard, and those who landed uninjured couldn’t locate drops of vital 
weapons and explosives. Only 22 of the 65 soldiers who took part 
returned alive.

Subsequent successes – including 
forays into the desert to disable Luftwaffe planes – meant the SAS was 
expanded. Commandos played a leading role ahead of the invasion of Italy
and the Normandy landings in June 1944, which led the way to the 
liberation of Western Europe.

Operating behind Nazi lines, the 
troops helped the French Resistance disrupt German forces and provided 
vital intelligence for D-Day.

Despite its expertise, the SAS was 
disbanded in 1945. But one unnamed soldier was determined the regiment’s
history would not be lost over time. He compiled an extensive scrapbook
of every document and photograph he could lay his hands on.

He placed the diary under lock and key
and it was only discovered when he handed it to the SAS Regimental 
Association shortly before his death in the late 1990s. Placed in the 
regiment’s highly-confidential archives, only a few were aware of its 
existence until it was discovered by a documentary maker.

Colonel John Crosland, executive 
vice-president of the SAS Regimental Association, said: ‘The diary is a 
unique document and going through it is a very humbling experience. It 
shows how extraordinary these men were. Their deeds were astonishing but
they are so matter of fact in their reports.’

The SAS was reprieved in 1947 as 
military chiefs sought its expertise. Since then, the commandos have 
fought all over the world, including the conflicts in Iraq, Afghanistan 
and Libya. More than 20 SAS soldiers have been killed or suffered 
life-changing injuries, including amputations, on sensitive missions to 
disrupt the Taliban alone.
