Frail and disorientated as he stares blankly into the camera, this is the last photograph of Nelson Mandela - taken six months before he died.

The picture shows the former freedom fighter sitting mute in an armchair, his head propped up by a pillow and the tell-tale marks of an oxygen mask on his cheeks, as South African president Jacob Zuma grins proudly into the lens and squeezes his hand.

Behind them stand fellow anti-apartheid hero Cyril Ramaphosa and his wife in the photo opportunity taken at Mandela's home in Johannesburg, three weeks after Mandela's release from hospital on April 29.

Publicity stunt? The picture shows the former freedom fighter sitting mute in an armchair, his head propped up by a pillow and the tell-tale marks of an oxygen mask on his cheeks, as South African president Jacob Zuma grins into the lens and squeezes his hand

But the picture has been criticised by some as a shameless publicity stunt on the part of the South African president who has been blamed for exploiting his predecessor's ill health for political kudos.

Extraordinarily, he even claimed the former statesman was in 'good spirits and good shape' during the televised visit despite the fact that Mandela could neither move nor speak.

Since the picture was taken, Mandela disappeared entirely from public view, sparking speculation over the exact date of his death.

President Zuma announced his death yesterday following a long battle with complications relating to a lung infection.

His withering fragility is in stark contrast to the energetic orator who won the hearts and minds of the South African public following his release from prison in February 1990 after 27 years behind bars for fighting South Africa's apartheid regime.

But in the last years of his life, Nelson Mandela's own family has been at war, bickering between themselves over his £10million fortune.

And in the wake of the anti-apartheid leader's death at 95 yesterday, it is feared his surviving family will be plunged in to deep rifts over who stands to gain his fortune.

Mandela was married three times and fathered six children - only three of whom, his daughters Makaziwe, Zenani 'Zeni' and Zindziswa, are still alive.

Bitter dispute: Makaziwe Mandela, left, and her

with two of their father's oldest friends over a £1million trust fund

His daughter Makaziwe, from his first marriage, and Zenani, from his second marriage, have reportedly already become embroiled in a legal battle earlier this year over the control of a £1million trust fund.

Mr Mandela's third daughter, Zindzi, is not involved in the court action, the Star of South Africa reported.

The money was placed in the fund by Mr Mandela in 2005 to be distributed to his daughters only in the event of hardship as he wanted them to forge a career of their own rather than live off his money.

He is said to have set up around 27 such funds over the years after 'losing trust' in his children with the money intended to last generations for 'specific circumstances' and not general use.

But Makaziwe and Zanani are demanding access to the fund and have begun legal action against the trust's two directors; 84-year-old lawyer George Bizos, who defended Mandela in the 1963 Rivonia Trial, and 60-year-old Tokyo Sexwale who was a prisoner alongside Mandela on Robben Island.
