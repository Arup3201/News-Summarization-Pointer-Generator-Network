Kate Moss's model sister has been forced to apologise after sending an 'ill thought-out' tweet using the N-word.

Lottie Moss, 17, took to her account at 4am last night to tweet a lyric from Chris Brown's song Loyal which includes the offensive word. 

She went on to tell her 7,000 followers how it had been a 'successful night' because she had thrown a drink over her ex-boyfriend.

Lottie Moss, the 17-year-old model sister of Kate Moss, has apologised after sending an 'ill thought-out' tweet using the N-word

The tweet, sent at 4am, featured a lyric from a Chris Brown song which included the offensive word 

She tweeted: 'I just want a monkey,' adding afterwards: 'When a rich n***a want ya and ur girl can't do nothing for ya'.

Later that evening, Lottie wrote: 'You know it's a successful night when you throw your drink in your ex boyfriends face.'

A spokesman for the model told MailOnline that Lottie was 'hugely apologetic'.

She said: 'Lottie unfortunately made an ill-thought out use of a song lyric, and she is hugely apologetic if any offence has been caused.' 

The model has now deleted the tweet and sent another one this morning saying: 'truly sorry if any offence has been caused by my ill-thought out use of a song lyric, huge apologies to everyone.'

Lottie, a prolific tweeter, raised eyebrows last year when she announced on Twitter that she ‘hates chavs’. 

Lottie (pictured left at a Calvin Klein party and right at the Victoria's Secret fashion show) is the daughter of Kate's father Peter and his second wife Inger. She is signed with Storm, the agency which spotted Kate

She later deleted the tweet and apologised for quoting the song lyric, saying it was 'ill-thought'

She said: 'I hate chavs, I hate everything about them, I hate their loud voices and the words 'init', 'phat', 'fam', etc.'

Months later, referring to 'chavs' again, she declared: 'I honestly don’t understand half of what they’ve put. The grammar and spelling is shocking.’

Lottie, who is 5ft 5inches tall, is signed with Storm Models, the agency that discovered Kate, 41, at New York's JFK airport when she was a 14-year-old.

She has already fronted campaigns for Calvin Klein Jeans and Valentino Red.

Lottie - the daughter of Kate's father Peter and his second wife Inger - was one of the 15 bridesmaids when Kate and Jamie Hince married in 2011.
