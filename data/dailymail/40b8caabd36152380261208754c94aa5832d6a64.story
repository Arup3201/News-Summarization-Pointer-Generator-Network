A former player for the all female Legends Football League is suing the company on claims they mistreat their players and stiff them on entire seasons of pay.

Melissa Margulies of Redondo Beach, California filed a class action Friday in which she names Legends League, formerly known as Lingerie League, as defendants along with it's founder Mitchell Mortaza.

Margulies claims the league intentionally misclassifies players as independent contractors in order to avoid paying them wages and overtime.

'The designation...was and is clearly improper because the players lack the requisite control and discretion over their job responsibilities and duties to deserve treatment as independent contractors,' states the complaint obtained by Courthouse News.

Legends Football League operates 10 teams out of cities across the United States. There are also leagues in Australia and Canada.

The women used to hit the gridiron in skimpy uniforms of bras and panties. Last year Mortaza dropped the underwear and lingerie moniker in exchange for the Legends brand and slightly less revealing outfits that include protective padding.

While he was padding his players' bodies, Margulies' suit says Mortaza was neglecting to pad their wallets.

'There were entire seasons where plaintiff and members of the plaintiff class received no income despite playing in the football league,' the class action suit reads
