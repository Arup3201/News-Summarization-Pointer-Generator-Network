You wouldn't expect Karl Lagerfeld to have any difficulty selling a luxury apartment in one of the most sought-after residential areas in New York City.

But it took the fashion icon two years to get the 2,200-square-foot property in Gramercy Park off his hands.

The legendary Chanel designer also had to drop his asking price by $2 million to complete the sale. Reports suggest that Lagerfeld never actually moved in. 

Sleek: The apartment in Gramercy Park boasts 2,200-square foot of space and incredible views

Making a loss: Fashion icon Karl Lagerfeld sold the apartment for $2 million less than the original asking price

Convenient: The bathroom includes a large soaking tub, double vanity sink and separate shower

Fit for the most demanding chef: The kitchen includes cherry-wood fittings and top of the line appliances

Luxury: The master bedroom suite includes a full ensuite

Lagerfeld first attempted to sell the exclusive pad in 2011 for $6.575 million, but eventually sealed a $4.5 million deal with investment banker Sebastian Barrack just a few weeks ago.

Chanel's creative director purchased the sleek, sixth-floor flat at 50 Gramercy Park North for $6.69 million in 2006.

According to the listing at Douglas Elliman Real Estate, the three-bedroom property includes a entry foyer and large chef’s kitchen with top of the line appliances.

Other amenities include a bedroom suite with a walk-in closet and a bathroom with a double vanity sink, separate shower and large soaking tub.

Exclusive access: The apartment block looks over and has private entry to Gramercy Park

Downside? The apartment reportedly suffers from bad natural light

Spacious: The second bedroom also reveals clean, white lines. Plus a mannequin

The apartment also boasts incredible views and exclusive access to Gramercy Park, one of the last remaining keyed private parks in New York City.

New owner Barrack can also take advantage of the pampering services offered by the nearby luxury Gramercy Park Hotel.

This includes a valet, butler service, housekeeping, catering, room service, event planning, personal shopping, priority reservations, fitness center, spa, and a private rooftop club.

But nothing is ever perfect. Apparently the apartment suffers from poor natural light and the maintenance fee is high - around $7,439 a month.
