A toddler has been cured of a rare condition after having his skull broken apart and pieced back together like a jigsaw.

Ethan Mair, two, from Gosport, Hampshire, was born with craniosynostosis - a condition which caused the skull to fuse before birth.

While most babies are born with gaps in the skull which allow the brain to grow, Ethan’s had already fused by the time he was born.

Ethan Mair (pictured with his mother, Ashlea), two, was born with craniosynostosis - a condition which causes the skull to fuse early. Without treatment, he could have developed learning difficulties and sight problems

The toddler underwent five hours of surgery - during which he lost all the blood in his body - to reshape his skull and piece it back together.

Luckily, the gruelling operation was a success, and his parents have now been told that Ethan will need no further surgery.

His mother, Ashlea, 24, said: ‘When I realised that Ethan’s skull would be broken apart and then pieced back together, I was shocked.

‘It was described to me as though his skull was like a jigsaw puzzle.

‘Then when he had the surgery and we were told that he’d lost so much blood from his head that he’d had a full body blood transfusion, I was horrified.

‘It was heart breaking to think what he’d been through.

Ethan had a five hour operation at Oxford's John Radcliffe Hospital during which surgeons broke his skull and then pieced it back together like a jigsaw

Ethan (pictured after surgery) lost all of the blood in his body during his operation and had to have numerous transfusions. However, the surgery was a success and he is now recovering at home

‘But with his skull fused together, his brain wouldn’t have been able to grow and he could have ended up with eye sight, speech or mobility problems.

‘He’s been left with a big zigzag scar across his scalp, but that’s slowly being hidden with a full head of blonde hair. He’s doing really well.’

Whilst Ms Mair, a support worker for adults with learning disabilities, never noticed a problem with her youngest child, a doctor pointed out his odd shaped head when Ethan was just four-weeks-old.

Ms Mair said: ‘When the doctor mentioned his head shape I was a bit surprised.

Ethan (pictured before surgery) had such a minor deformation of the skull when he was diagnosed that his mother did not notice it - it was picked up by a doctor

‘I supposed I had noticed it but I never thought anything of it.

‘Then about two weeks later he started having eye sight problems - I couldn’t get him to focus at all, it was as though he was looking right through me.

‘The doctor arranged for us to have an emergency referral and that’s when I really started to worry.’

At three-months-old Ethan was officially diagnosed with craniosynostosis.

His mother said: ‘I didn’t know what it was and I’d never heard of it before.

Ms Mair (pictured with Ethan and his sister, Teigan) said: 'He's been left with a big zigzag scar across his scalp, but that's slowly being hidden with a full head of blonde hair. He's doing really well'

Ethan (pictured in hospital after his surgery) is not expected to need any further surgery

‘Naturally I went online and I just scared myself.

‘I read all these horror stories, and from then on I was just a mess.

‘The thought of losing my little boy was just too awful to even think about.’

Ethan underwent his five hour surgery at John Radcliffe Hospital, in Oxford, at just over a year old.

Ms Mair said: ‘His Dad had to go with him when he was put under because I just couldn’t bear it.

Ms Mair said: 'I'm so proud of Ethan for being so brave and getting through everything. He's a strong little boy and I feel so lucky that he's happy and healthy now'

‘He was my precious little boy and I knew I wouldn’t be able to face seeing him slip away.

‘The five hours of waiting were a nightmare, and when he finally did come around we were told how poorly he’d been during the op.

‘I rushed to see him in the high dependency unit and just burst into tears.

‘Seeing his scar was quite a shock, it really brought home what he’d been through.

Craniosynostosis is a rare problem with the skull that causes a baby to be born with, or to develop, an abnormally shaped head.

This can cause headaches, learning difficulties and eye problems.

These symptoms usually result from increased pressure within the skull.

The problem occurs as a result of the premature fusion of the different sections of the skull.

This means the skull is unable to grow in certain areas and when one area is prevented from growing, other areas may 'overgrow' to compensate.

Craniosynostosis affects about one in every 1,800 to 3,000 children.

Three quarters of cases are in boys.

The main treatment for the condition is surgery - most children recover well after the surgery and have no further problems but some develop other problems with their skull's development as they get older. This can require further surgery to correct.

‘It was a few hours before I could give him a cuddle but when I did it was amazing.’

Now Ethan is back home with his mother and sister, Teigan, four.

Ms Mair said: ‘I’m so proud of Ethan for being so brave and getting through everything.

‘He’s a strong little boy and I feel so lucky that he’s happy and healthy now.

‘Seeing him play with his sister with a big smile on his face is just incredible.’

Gill Ruff, the group administrator for Headlines, the craniofacial support group said:

‘Craniosynostosis is the premature fusion of the skull before birth, either in one place or in multiple places.

‘Normally when a child is born the brain is made of individual plates. If the plates have prematurely fused, the brain cannot grow.

‘The child could have brain damage, and pressure on the brain if left untreated.

‘In the UK there are four specialist units at Alder Hay Hospital in Liverpool, Birmingham Children’s Hospital, John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford, and Great Ormond Street Hospital, who specialise in the treatment of craniosynostosis.

‘For children with single suture craniosynostosis, the child is usually given surgery at around a year old.

‘If this surgery is successful the child will normally face no further problems.’
