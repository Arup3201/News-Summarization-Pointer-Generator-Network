A man who once worked closely with beleaguered comedian Bill Cosby has come forward to detail how he once helped the star funnel thousands of dollars to a virtual harem of young women he kept during The Cosby Show's 8-season run.

Frank Scotti, 90, told the Daily News on Sunday that he spent years as NBC's 'fixer' for Cosby--as a conduit through whom the actor sent lady pals funds and as a guard at Cosby's dressing room door when those women visited.

'He had everybody fooled,' said Scotti, who says he eventually walked away from the star because of how he treated women.

NBC employee speaks: A former NBC employee has come forward claiming he helped Bill Cosby funnel women to many women in the 1980s and 1900s. Despite rumors of protests, Bill Cosby's Florida show went off without a hint of trouble on Friday evening (pictured)

The NBC veteran told the New York Daily News, in a story published Sunday, that Cosby had a rotating lineup of young women brought to his Brooklyn dressing room by a complicit modeling agency.

Scotti said the Manhattan agency's owner would lead the girls there and leave once Cosby picked his chosen lady.

'She knew exactly what was going to go on,' Scotti told the News. 'Then he'd tell me, 'Stand outside the door and don't let anyone in.' Now you put that together and figure (out) why.'

According to Scotti, some of the girls were as young as 16.

Scotti claims Cosby would put women he especially liked up in apartments and give them up to $2,000 per month.

After decades, Scotti's even saved receipts from money orders he says he gave those women for Cosby.

One of those women, Shawn Thompson, had a daughter named Autumn Jackson who would claim Cosby was her father.

Halcyon days: Frank Scotti worked with Cosby during the star's time at NBC in the 1980s and 90s, when he starred on The Cosby Show (pictured). After decades, Scotti's even saved receipts from money orders he says he gave women for Cosby, though the money was moved in Scotti's name, he says

The money orders, though, are in Scotti's name and not Cosby's. 

'I did a lot of crazy things for him,' Scotti told the Daily News. 'He was covering himself by having my name on it. It was a coverup. I realized it later.'

And when he did, Scotti said he had to walk away.

'You've got all of these kids, every time,' he told the Daily News. 'I used to like him, but that's the reason I quit him after so many years — because of the girls.'

In recent weeks, at least seven women have publicly accused the 77-year-old Cosby of sexual assault years ago. Cosby has not been charged in connection with any of the allegations. Only one woman has filed suit - Andrea Constand, who sued in 2005 and settled for an undisclosed amount before the case went to trial.

Cosby's attorney, Martin Singer, has criticized previous 'decades-old discredited allegations' and denied some others. He suggested in a Friday statement that Cosby's accusers may have another agenda.

'There has never been a shortage of lawyers willing to represent people with claims against rich, powerful men, so it makes no sense that not one of these new women who just came forward for the first time now ever asserted a legal claim back at the time they allege they had been sexually assaulted.'

A statement issued Friday by Bill Cosby's lawyer, Martin Singer, in response to allegations of sexual assault against the comic:

'The new, never-before-heard claims from women who have come forward in the past two weeks with unsubstantiated, fantastical stories about things they say occurred 30, 40, or even 50 years ago have escalated far past the point of absurdity.

These brand new claims about alleged decades-old events are becoming increasingly ridiculous, and it is completely illogical that so many people would have said nothing, done nothing, and made no reports to law enforcement or asserted civil claims if they thought they had been assaulted over a span of so many years.

Lawsuits are filed against people in the public eye every day. There has never been a shortage of lawyers willing to represent people with claims against rich, powerful men, so it makes no sense that not one of these new women who just came forward for the first time now ever asserted a legal claim back at the time they allege they had been sexually assaulted.

This situation is an unprecedented example of the media's breakneck rush to run stories without any corroboration or adherence to traditional journalistic standards. Over and over again, we have refuted these new unsubstantiated stories with documentary evidence, only to have a new uncorroborated story crop up out of the woodwork. When will it end?

It is long past time for this media vilification of Mr. Cosby to stop.'
