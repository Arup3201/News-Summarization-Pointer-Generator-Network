It isn't every day that The Queen drives past your front door and the grins on the faces of this excited family were only rivalled by that of the monarch as she cruised through Brixton in her Bentley.

Smiling and waving as she rolled through South London, the Queen was spotted by the woman and two children as she rolled past the steps of their home on her way to an  inner city riding centre.

Joined by daughter-in-law the Duchess of Cornwall, the monarch, still a keen rider herself at 87, was visiting the Ebony Horse Club and Community Riding Centre in gang-ridden Brixton.

Once she arrived at the centre, she watched local youngsters give a demonstration of their skills on horseback - and even play a little polo in a sawdust ring overlooked by tower blocks.

Her daughter-in-law, Camilla, is president of the organisation which gives disadvantaged children from the London suburb, blighted by crime and rioting, a pastime away from the streets.

Chatting to volunteers the monarch joked: 'It’s difficult to get them to do anything – children and horses.'

She
added: 'It’s all about temperament'. On this it was not entirely clear 
which she was referring to, although one suspects she meant both.

Cheers: The Queen and the Duchess of Cornwall arrived together and were greeted by a welcoming crowd

All smiles: The Queen, who looked cheerful in coral pink, smiled broadly as she was shown around the stables

The
two senior royals had made their way from Buckingham Palace through 
several gritty housing estates in a chauffeur driven a Burgundy Bentley 
before they arrived at the centre, which is situated in the heart of 
bustling Brixton. 

Dressed in a geranium wool crepe coat trimmed with 
gilt buttons over a contrasting salmon-coloured dress, the Queen was 
clearly impressed by what she saw.

After being introduced to its 
founder, Ros Spearing, their host for the morning, she went straight to 
meet some of the children the club has helped and their favourite 
mounts.

First was Kamina Edmundson-Brown, 18, whose love of horses 
inspired by Ebony has now developed into a full-time career. She is 
currently studying at the Royal Veterinary College.

She was holding 
the reins of one of the children’s favourite ponies, an 11-year-old 
black and white Irish Cobb called Buddy, who had been picked for his 
gentle temperament.

'I really don’t think he will do anything to embarrass us,' she said. The
Queen asked her where she lived and how long she had been riding and 
sounded particularly impressed at Kamina’s choice of career.

Double act: The Queen and the Duchess of Cornwall arrived to the sound of applause from onlookers

'He’s wonderful, very smart' said the Queen gesturing to Buddy. 'My heart was in my mouth,' Kamina said afterwards.

Camilla,
wearing tartan Edina Ronay, was meanwhile making friends with the help 
of a large bag of mints she had taken from her pocket.

'I think he’s my now favourite, he’s terrific,' she said of Buddy, who began to nudge her for more sweets.

The
Queen also talked intently to 13-year-old Cameron Chapman and was 
fascinated to learn that he lived in Kemble House, one of the run-down 
tower blocks overlooking the centre.

'What you mean he lives up there?' she said gesticulating to the building. Cameron told the Queen that he had been riding for two years and that it had changed his life.

He
said afterwards: 'I saw them building the centre and came down every 
day to stand at the gates and bug them. I had never seen a horse before 
but offered to do the sweeping up, all their odd jobs, anything to be 
involved.

'Now I am here every spare minute I can. It’s really 
changed my life. There’s not a lot to do round here, all my friends hang
around on the streets. People get into a lot of trouble. I am just 
here, though.'

He added: 'I’m really surprised she [the Queen] is coming to Brixton. It is full of trouble.'

Impressed: The Queen and the Duchess of Cornwall appeared to enjoy the performance

Camilla,
meanwhile, was plying some of the other ponies with mints, prompting 
the stable’s oldest resident, Marmalade, a 15-year-old Welsh Cob, to 
bare her teeth in delight.

'The Duchess remarked she must be an old 
lady but I told her there was still a lot of life in her,' said Safia 
Fajemissin-Kham, 11.

Among the other riders the Queen chatted with was Oulwakarede Asunloye, eight. He
said afterwards: 'She asked me whether my picture was up on the wall 
[with the other success stories] and I told her that I had only had four
lessons. She said: "I think it will be one day".'

The royal visitors
were then introduced to the families of two local boys, both of whom 
were involved in the club but lost their lives in random acts of 
appalling violence – Nathan Foster, who was shot in 2006, and Junior 
Nkewelle, who was just 15 when he was stabbed last  September.

The 
Queen told Nathan Foster’s sister, Shanelle: 'It is a very unusual place
[referring to the location of the club] but what a good idea.'

'I can’t believe she is here, let along spoke to me. It has been totally surreal,' she said. 'The
wonderful thing about riding is that is doesn’t matter who you are or 
what you have done.

'The horse doesn’t know anything about you and 
doesn’t care. You aren’t being judged. And if you don’t concentrate on 
that horse then it will throw you or run off.'

After touring the 
stables the Queen and Camilla took their seats on a dais to watch a some
of the club's  riders go through their paces, including taking a few 
jumps and even demonstrating a little basic polo.

Afterwards the Queen chatted to the youngsters and volunteers including Jody Thorsby, 34, who works in PR.

Miss Thorsby said: 'The Queen said: "They aren’t your typical polo ponies, are they, but they have a lot of spirit."'

Ebony
started 17 years ago when a lone volunteer, Ros Spearing, took five 
children across London on public transport to go riding.

Her aim was 
to help them improve their life skills, education and aspirations by 
providing access to horse riding, outdoor activities and mentoring.

By
2006 more than 80 youngsters were involved and two years ago the club 
opened permanent stables for 135 in Coldharbour Ward, Brixton, one of 
the most deprived neighbourhoods in Britain and in the top 15 wards in 
London for crime.

Many of the club members have never seen, let alone
sat, on a horse and are often children with special educational needs, 
those at threat of expulsion and exclusion from school or in general 
need of support.

They are taught skills including punctuality, 
regular attendance, commitment to improvement and team work in addition 
to developing a love of riding.
