A Philadelphia judge 
upheld murder charges Wednesday against a fundamentalist Christian 
couple in their 8-month-old son’s faith-healing death, saying things 
might be different if their toddler hadn't died four years ago ‘under 
strikingly similar circumstances.’

Herbert
and Catherine Schaible were still on probation after the 2009 death of 
their 2-year-old son Kent, for which they were convicted of involuntary 
manslaughter.

In April, 
Brandon Schable died of pneumonia after the couple decided to pray over 
the infant rather than take him in for medical care, according to their 
police statements. Their probation required them to seek immediate 
medical help if another child was sick or injured.

Prayed to death? A Philadelphia judge upheld murder charges Wednesday against Herbert and Catherine Schaible in the faith-healing death of their 8-month-old son

‘They learned in the worst possible 
way...exactly what these symptoms could lead to in a child, especially a
young child, if not medically cared for,’ Common Pleas Judge Benjamin 
Lerner said, referring to the 2009 death of 2-year-old Kent Schaible. 
‘We've been here before...under strikingly similar circumstances.’

Defense
lawyer Bobby Hoof argued that Brandon died just three days after he 
came down with cold and flu symptoms and said there was no evidence of 
malice, as required for third-degree murder.

‘A reasonable parent probably would wait three days to take their child to a doctor,’ said Hoof.

Again? The Schaibles had previously been convicted of manslaughter in the 2009 death of their 2-year-old son under circumstances prosecutors called 'eerily similar'

‘We
tried to fight the devil, but in the end the devil won,' the couple 
told homicide detectives investigating Brandon’s death, which could have
been prevented with basic medical care.

Lerner seemed especially troubled that Brandon had increasingly labored breathing but still got no medical care.

He
compared the current case to that of a parent who repeatedly gave a 
child peanut butter despite knowing of a potentially deadly allergy to 
it.

‘How many times do you 
have to do that again before a child dies, and a jury can infer legal 
malice?’ Lerner asked. ‘Is it a second time, or is that not enough? Is 
it a third time?’

About a 
dozen U.S. children die each year when parents turn to faith healing 
instead of medicine, typically from highly treatable problems, according
to experts.

Faith-healing: First Century Gospel Church, where the parents are members, says using medicine is a sin

Murderers? Philadelphia District Attorney Seth Williams, announces Herbert and Catherine Schaible would be charged with murder. The judge upheld the charge Wednesday, despite strong objection from the defense

The 
Schaibles are third-generation members and former teachers at the First 
Century Gospel Church, a small, insular congregation in northeast 
Philadelphia.

‘We believe in
divine healing, that Jesus...died on the cross to break the devil's 
power,’ Herbert Schaible told homicide detectives after Brandon died.

Philadelphia
District Attorney Seth Williams said the care was never given and 
decided to bring murder charges against the couple.

Their remaining seven children have been placed in foster care.

‘He
is incarcerated because of his faith,’ said lawyer Bobby Hoof in May 
when the couple was ordered held without bail. He described client 
Herbert Schaible's mindset as resolute.

‘We
believe in divine healing, that Jesus shed blood for our healing and 
that he died on the cross to break the devil's power,’ Herbert Schaible 
told Philadelphia homicide detectives in April. Medicine, he said, ‘is 
against our religious beliefs.’

‘These
are people who have been brought up in these communities; their beliefs
are reinforced every day,’ said Shawn Francis Peters, a University of 
Wisconsin lecturer who has studied faith-healing deaths.

‘They're not trained intellectually to question these doctrines, where 
the rest of us might engage in critical inquiry, weighing the benefits 
of medicine versus the benefits of prayer,’ he said.

Peters
isn't sure that courts have the means to prevent the problem, since 
such people don't fear legal punishment, only Judgment Day. Some believe
death ‘is a good outcome,’ given their belief in the afterlife, he 
said.

‘They don't want 
to harm their children. They're just in this particularly narrow - and 
very, very dangerous - way misguided about the potential of medical 
science,’ he said.

He 
believes that ‘empathetic’ intervention, through dialogue between church
and public health educators, could help some ‘get to a point where they
allow their beliefs and practices to evolve.’

But there's also a risk that could backfire, and drive these communities further underground, he said.

It is estimated that around a dozen U.S. children die in faith-healing cases each year, a handful of which spawn criminal charges, according to experts.

The First Century Gospel Church of Philadelphia’s teachings has clashed with authorities in the past.

In 1991, eight children died in a measles outbreak. All the parents were members of either First Century Gospel Church or the nearby Faith Tabernacle of Nicetown which also preaches faith-healing.

Dale and Shannon Hickman were part of a string of faith-based healing related deaths in Oregon in recent years. They were sentenced to 6 years in prison in the death of their home-born son in 2011

In 2011, Dale and Shannon Hickman of Oregon were sentenced to 75 months in prison after turning to faith healing to say their premature newborn, which was born in a family home, died from complications that could have easily been averted with medical care.

Also in Oregon, Jeff and Marci Beagley, were sentenced to 16 months in 2010 for the death of their 16-year-old son. The couple refused to use medicine for their son Neil, who was suffering from a preventable urinary tract blockage. Instead, they prayed and used anointing oils in the hope of divine intervention.

'Too many children have died unnecessarily - a graveyard full,' Judge Steven Maurer said at their sentencing. 'This has to stop.'

Oregon has since banned faith healing as a defense against murder charges.
