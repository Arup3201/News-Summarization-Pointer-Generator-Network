BBC chairman Lord Patten yesterday admitted the corporation was ‘over-managed’ by a vast number of highly paid, jargon-spouting bureaucrats.

And despite overseeing a shambolic period encompassing the Lord McAlpine scandal and subsequent departure of director general George Entwistle, Lord Patten hinted he would consider another term in his £110,000-a-year part-time role – which he described as ‘exciting’.

‘I am 68. I hadn’t thought the job would be as exciting as it turned out to be. I would like to help the BBC face up to a digital future,’ he told the annual Voice of the Listener and Viewer conference.

He also batted away suggestions that 
he did not give the BBC enough attention because he has ten other jobs, 
claiming he worked more than the three to four days a week his contract 
stipulates.

But Lord Patten, who was appointed last year on a four-year contract, conceded the BBC is ‘both over-managed and under-managed’.

He said: ‘The tendency towards over-management comes from the sheer 
weight and numbers of senior people, their pay, their titles, their 
jargon.

‘I worry that this means those at the top of the organisation can become
 distracted – diverted from the job in hand and the central question of 
whether the programmes are good enough.

‘This will be a fairly familiar concern to BBC-watchers and is often 
frustrating for our friends. We’re on the case, progress is being made, 
but we need to do more.

The lack of a clear line of responsibility and 
co-operation between senior executives were problems of 
‘under-management’ and there needed to be more ‘self-criticism’, he 
added.

Lord Patten also defended Mr Entwistle, who was forced to resign after 
just 54 days in the job when Newsnight wrongly linked former Tory 
treasurer Lord McAlpine to a child abuse inquiry in North Wales.

Friends have expressed concern for the 50-year-old, who was photographed
 looking bearded, drawn and a little dishevelled yesterday as he gave 
evidence to the independent inquiry investigating Newsnight’s decision 
to axe a programme about the Jimmy Savile child abuse scandal last year.

Lord Patten said: ‘Given everything that went wrong, it was the right 
thing for him to go when he did. But that should in no way justify the 
way his reputation is now being traduced. I don’t agree with character 
assassinations.’

He added that Mr Entwistle had been wrongly depicted as a ‘hapless and 
inadequate figure’ and his reputation, built up over ‘23 years of 
outstanding service’ to the BBC had been ‘trashed’.

It is expected that former head of Sky News Nick Pollard, who is running the inquiry, will reach his conclusions in December.  

The corporation is ‘assisting’ with the legal fees of BBC staff involved
 in the inquiry, including Newsnight editor Peter Rippon, head of news 
Helen Boaden, and her deputy Stephen Mitchell.

Alan Maclean QC, the barrister who represented Tony Blair and Alastair 
Campbell during the Hutton Inquiry, is advising Mr Pollard and is 
estimated to be able to charge around a £1,000 a day for his services.

Lord Patten commented: ‘The Pollard Inquiry has been thorough and as a 
consequence it has been expensive.

‘Like the Leveson Inquiry, it will only be worth the expense if we can 
act decisively to make clear improvements on the back of it.’

‘Once we get the Pollard report, it will I hope be much clearer to the Trust what went wrong and how.

‘There may well be consequences for some of the individuals involved. We
 will then need to roll our sleeves up and work alongside the new 
director general to put things right.’

Royal Opera House chief executive Tony Hall will take over the role in March.

Tim Davie will continue as acting director general until then.

A BBC Trust spokesman said: 'Lord Patten was answering a question about 
whether he would agree to stay on for a second term to argue the case 
for Charter renewal. 

'All he replied was that he was committed to trying to restore the reputation and standing of the BBC.'
