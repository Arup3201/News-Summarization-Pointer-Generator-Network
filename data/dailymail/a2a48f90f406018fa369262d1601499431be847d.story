A 9-year-old boy who disappeared from Seattle with his father in early September was found safe Wednesday on a remote island in the South Pacific nearly 5,500 miles away from home.

Billy Ginger Hanson was supposed to return to his mother in Pennsylvania September 4 after spending the summer with his father, but he never boarded the plane to go home.

The child was last seen at Shilshole Bay Marine in Ballard, where he presumably boarded his father's sailboat, Draco.

Long way from home: The father and son sailed 5,450 miles from Seattle to Niue

Following an intense two-month search, on Wednesday police and FBI investigators located Billy and his father, 46-year-old Jeffrey Hanson, on the island of Niue, reported SeattlePI.com. 

The tiny island nation with a population of 1,611 is located in the Pacific some 1,490 miles northeast of New Zealand - and a whopping 5,450 miles southwest of Seattle, Washington.

Mr Hanson has been charged with international parental kidnapping and will remain in Niue pending extradition to the U.S.

Billy's mother, Joanna Hanson, has been given the good news and federal officials are now working on reuniting her with her son. 

It took the efforts of the FBI; the US Attorney’s Office; the Seattle Police Department’s Major Crimes Task Force; the Port of Seattle Police Department; the US Coast Guard, and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children to track down the missing boy.

It's not known exactly when Hanson set sail from Seattle with Billy. They were last seen by authorities August 28. 

Billy was supposed to fly back to his mother in Pennsylvania on September 4 - though the FBI says he never boarded the flight.

Hanson is accused of abducting Billy from Shilshole Bay Marina.

Billy was last seen wearing black knee-length surf shorts, with no shirt or shoes.

Boat: FBI agents have asked Hawaii's sailing community to look out for Hanson's 1976 White Cooper sailboat named 'Draco,' pictured 

FBI agents in Honolulu made an appeal to Hawaii's sailing community earlier this month to look out for Hanson's 1976 White Cooper sailboat named 'Draco.'

A federal arrest warrant was issued for Hanson September 12. 

'When I talked to Jeff he told me they were going to Blake Island,' Billy's mother Joanna Hanson told KIRO in September. 'I love my son, and I want him back.'

The Star Advertiser described Hanson as 'a known drug abuser with a volatile personality.'

'Our focus is on helping the agents at the Seattle FBI recover Billy safely, so he can go back to his mom where he belongs,' said Tom Simon, a FBI spokesman in Honolulu. 'Hawaii and the islands of the Pacific have a vibrant sailing and nautical community, and we are appealing to that community to be on the lookout for this sailboat and contact authorities with leads.'
