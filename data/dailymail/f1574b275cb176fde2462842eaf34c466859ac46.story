The photographer who took the ‘Break the Internet’ full frontal nude pictures of Kim Kardashian insisted on Thursday that 'they are art’ and he is 'very proud of them'.

Jean-Paul Goude, a legendary French photographer, told a friend that they ‘were by no means a caricature of Kim, but art.’

The comments follow a flood of parodies being posted on the internet mocking the 34-year-old.

Holding nothing back: Kim Kardashian went fully nude in a newly released shot from her shoot for Paper magazine with Jean-Paul Goude (censored by MailOnline)

What a treat: Kim Kardashian reveals her glistening naked form in yet another shot from Paper magazine's much-talked about Jean-Paul Goude shoot

He told a close colleague in Paris: ‘I am very proud of what they represent – yes there is meant to be humour in the pictures, but above all they are very artistic’.

Mr Goude, 74, has not granted any formal interviews since the publication of the pictures because he ‘wants to remain humble', said Virginie Laguenes, who works with the photographer.

‘He is busy with a new project, and wants to carry on with that,’ said Mme Laguenes. She said he ‘worked very well’ with Kim, after the pair hit it off straight away when doing the shoot for Paper Magazine in Paris in September.

The American reality TV star beauty smeared herself in baby oil for the shots and then slowly unpeeled a black cocktail dress for Jean-Paul.

Soon Kim and Jean-Paul were recreating his iconic 1976 ‘Champagne Incident’ image of model Carolina Beaumont opening a bottle of bubbly onto a glass balanced on her bottom.

Photoshop and other technical methods were clearly used to create the image of champagne flying through the air, but Mr Goude has insisted that very little of Kim's body was altered.

Kim was married in Paris earlier this year, and owns a flat in the city along with her husband, the rapper Kanye West.

Artist: Photographer Jean-Paul Goode and former lover Grace Jones. They had a son together

Another source told MailOnline: ‘She feels very comfortable with French people, and pretty much did anything that Jean-Paul asked. She absolutely loved the snaps.

‘Kim is particularly happy about the way the pictures are already becoming as iconic as the 1976 champagne incident ones.’

Jean-Paul is famous around the world for his stunning images, having worked with top models including Grace Jones, a former lover with whom he has a son, Paulo.

He has also taken pictures of singer and actress Vanessa Paradis, and is the artist behind numerous memorable advertising campaigns.

One, for car firm Citroen in 1984, showed a vehicle speeding into the mouth of a giant robotic head looking like Grace Jones.

Earlier on Wednesday, Kim shared the two cover shots with her 21 million Instagram followers, captioning the bottom shot with the magazine cover line: 'Break the Internet'. 

Trending: Kim certainly lit up the internet with comical discussion of her new magazine cover, available online at Paper.com

And late on Thursday more pictures from the shoot emerged with the reality star posing full frontal nude in two extremely risqué new shots.  

The images, which MailOnline has chosen to censor, make no attempt at discretion as the naked Kim faces the camera front on, grinning happily.

In an interview published on Yahoo Style, Paper's editorial director Mickey Boardman explained that it was all Kim's idea.

'Kim’s attitude was "if we’re gonna do it, let’s really go there,"' he said. 

'And it was her idea to take off her clothes and show more than her butt. But we [Paper] didn’t say "let’s do a cover with your butt hanging out."

'She said she was willing to take her clothes off and one thing lead to another.'

And Kim certainly shows no sign of nerves in the shoot, as she holds her dress down around her knees.

In a second new photo from the inside spread Kim can be seen slipping out of her sparkling cocktail dress, her shining behind turned towards the camera to reveal her bare breast.

Smeared in baby oil, Kim looks delighted with herself as she smiles at the camera.

And as for who had the task of oiling up that much talked about bottom?

'It was the make-up artist,' revealed Boardman. 'It was someone who she works with a lot so she felt comfortable.' 

'Which one's real?' Referencing what is most certainly a Photoshop-enhanced image of Kim Kardashian's bottom, Chelsea Handler posted a side-by-side comparison of her bare bum  on Instagram

Mythical beast: One user turned Kim into a beautiful centaur

And as for the talk that the booty had been digitally enhanced, Boardman had this to say: '[There was] much less [retouching] than people think. 

'That’s really what she looks like. That’s her. I would say it’s the normal amount of retouching that’s on a normal cover.'

He also revealed: 'It is not padded. It is not augmented. That is all really her.' 

But already, the cyber world was overrun with memes parodying the covers. One was shot with her looking coquettishly over her shoulder with her bare bottom on full display. A second was the Champagne Incident remake.

But it was the booty shot which captured everyone's imagination, with Chelsea Handler being one of the first celebs to take a stab at mocking it.

Referencing what is most certainly a Photoshop-enhanced bottom, Handler posted a side-by-side comparison of her bare bum with Kim's on Instagram.

The comedienne, 39, captioned her image: 'Can you believe more than 2 a** can fit on the same screen? Guess which one's real. Your move, instagram.'   

Glistening: A lot of users compared the reality star to a glazed donut

In the image Chelsea wears nothing but her bra as her underwear is pulled down while she snaps a mirror selfie in a bathroom.

Glee actress Naya Rivera - whose looks (and style choices) have been compared to Kim's - also had something to say. 

'I normally don't. But... you're someone's mother...' the 27-year-old actress commented on Instagram, referring to Kim and husband Kanye West's toddler daughter North. 

Kim got some support though too, including from MailOnline's US Editor At Large Piers Morgan who described the image as one that will be 'forever etched in the memory'.

Pouring cold water on the internet trolls who had come out to mock Kim, Piers continued: 'It’s time for me to make a shocking admission: I like and admire Kim Kardashian-West.

Meanwhile, the internet continued to go to town creating their own versions of the image, from centaurs to docking stations.

Twitter user @KelKulus was reminded of a mythical creature when he saw the Paper magazine image, tweeting his own version with the caption: 'Kim Kardashian looks so much like a centaur in Paper Magazine, I figured I'd take it one step further.'

Kim's rear becomes the rump of a horse, turning the reality star into a centaur.

Lashing out: Kim's style stalker Naya Rivera criticised Kim's mag cover, writing on Instagram 'you are someone's mother'

@GeneralBoles killed two celebrity birds with one stone by photoshopping Russell Brand's face onto Kim's derriere with a speech bubble exclaiming 'PARKLIFE!'

Food items has also been another way to describe Kim's glistening rear; from peaches and potatoes to glazed donuts the internet went to the market on comparisons. 

'Krispy Kim' proved to be an apt nickname for the reality star, and her rear was even replaced with two pieces of Aero chocolate. 

Pippa Middleton wearing that bridesmaid dress at her sister's Royal Wedding was also used as a comparision, though really the Brits behind didn't really 'do it better' than Kim. 

Another tweeter highlighted the mother-of-one's gravitational pull by surrounding her derriere with asteroids. 

The user also gave Kim a surrealist makeover by Photoshopping her bottom onto her face for quadruple the cheeky impact. 

One user even compared the image of Kim to that of a Barbie doll, as @SarahKhalegh pointed out: 'Kim Kardashian literally looks like a plastic &unrealistic Barbie doll. Look at her waist in comparison to her body.'

It does seem the magazine have done their best to Photoshop the reality star's waist to oblivion and make a behind look bigger than James's Giant Peach. 

Loved up: Earlier on Wednesday, Kim shared a cut picture of herself getting a kiss from husband Kanye West

Support: And of course Kanye had nothing but good things to hashtag about his wife's racy cover shoot

Just under a fortnight ago, Kim stepped out looking far curvier as she joined her husband Kanye at the 2014 LACMA Art + Film Gala honouring Quentin Tarantino and Barbara Kruger.

Of course the rapper, who only follows Kim on Twitter, tweeted his approval of the cover with the simple hashtag '#ALLDAY'. 

While all this was going on, it was business as usual for Kim, who was spotted out at a Beverly Hills hotel with her family for her pregnant sister Kourtney's baby shower. 

However Kim didn't get exactly what she wanted... the internet seems to be working perfectly fine.
