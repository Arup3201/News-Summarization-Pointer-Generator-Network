After a catwalk invasion by a pair of bare-breasted feminist protesters, Paris Fashion Week got back on track on day four with strong showings from Christian Dior, Issey Miyake, Roland Mouret and Barbara Bui.

While FEMEN activists were busy entertaining baffled tourists on a bateau mouche with a protest in support of Greenpeace, the long awaited new collection from Raf Simons at Dior was proving worth the wait as the designer sent an assured collection dominated by 50s style dresses down the runway, watched by Eva Herzigova and Olivia Palermo.

If Simons has his way, the prom dress will stage a comeback next summer, offering up a succession of strapless silk frocks in delicate shimmering grey overlaid with a lace patterned print in navy and ink.

But it wasn't all full-skirted gowns. Simons also showed sleek shifts with belled silk skirts in a surprisingly effective combination of blush pink and bright pumpkin as well as in African-inspired multicoloured stripes.

Striped success: Raf Simons offered up tight-waisted dresses in an array of hues at Christian Dior

Pumpkin and blush: Pink and orange made a surprisingly good team at Christian Dior

Luxe: A demure dress is given a naughty twist thanks to a tiny cut out that revealed a flash of toned tummy

Blue is the colour: But at Barbara Bui, fashion was the game and she demonstrated just how good she is at it with her denim-heavy vision for next summer

Double denim: Bui appeared to be intent on proving just how versatile the world's favourite off duty fabric can be and used it repeatedly in her latest collection

Royal approval: Princess St√©phanie of Monaco's daughter Pauline Ducruet was accompanied by her adorable pet dog for her front row appearance at Barbara Bui

While Simons' offering was crammed 
with colour, Barbara Bui kicked off proceedings with a low key collection 
of sporty separates that came in a minimalist palette of navy, black and
stark white enlivened with the odd jolt of bright orange.

Denim,
a favourite fabric of the Franco-Vietnamese designer, cropped up repeatedly on
neatly tailored trousers, slouchy bomber jackets and even found its way
onto a bustier.

Indeed,
the designer appeared intent on showing just how versatile the world's 
favourite off duty textile can be, such was the number of times it 
appeared on the catwalk.

Print was kept to a minimum and where it did appear, it came in pale grey superimposed over sky blue. Punchy it wasn't, wearable it was.

But although Barbara Bui chose to keep pattern in the background, the same couldn't be said for Roland Mouret who used a bold bright pink and cobalt blue petal print to liven up his sporty white shift dresses.

Think pink: Bright pink has been a popular choice this month and Rouland Mouret also embraced it

Figure hugging: Rouland Mouret included several variations on his trademark form fitting dress

Embellished: A fuchsia silk gown was given bold sequinned sleeves at Rouland Mouret

Waterproof: Hussein Chalayan appeared to have British buyers in mind as he showed his collection accessoried with rain repelling clear plastic hats

Challenging: Chalayan had plenty of desirable silk pieces in fluid cream silk as well as more directional pieces such as this dress made from multicoloured ribbons

Graphic block print was also used, 
showing up on peg leg trousers, a cross-strap crop top and a slouchy 
1980s style leather jacket.

Dresses,
Mouret's trademark were in relatively short supply but just when it 
seemed that the man who brought us the iconic Galaxy dress was 
going to end the show with more trousers, the first of a set of suitably
va va voom frocks appeared at the end of the runway.

In classic Mouret fashion, the 
cinched waists and knee-length hemlines were present and correct, but 
this time around, they came in fuschia silk, jazzed up with dramatic 
sequinned sleeves, and in skin tight grey and white stripes complete 
with a slightly incongruous emerald leather bust patch.

Although
separates have been the dominant force in Paris so far, Hussein 
Chalayan made like Mouret and presented a collection that was festooned 
with frocks.

True to form, 
Chalayan included a string of pieces best described as challenging before 
switching tack and presenting the watching fashion pack with beautifully tailored fluid silk gowns.

Lovely though Chalayan's pieces were, the title of best in show on day four was taken by Japanese veteran Issey Miyake, whose expert touch with tailoring left the front row staring lustfully after the clothes as they sashayed out of sight.

Highlights included an silk shirt-dress in striking blue, green and pink block print and a delicate round-shouldered coat dress in multi-tonal striped blue and crimson organza.

But with more than five decades of design experience, you wouldn't expect anything less from Miyake. Lucky too, that unlike poor beleaguered Nina Ricci, no uninvited Ukrainian protesters turned up to spoil the show.

Best in show: Japanese veteran Issey Miyake offered an assured collection that proved to be one of the highlights of day four at Paris Fashion Week

Highlight: Miyake showed that he hasn't lost his talent for tailoring (above) and unveiled a stunning block colour shirt dress that had the FROW readying their credit cards

Meanwhile... FEMEN activist were back up to their old tricks as they took over a bateau mouche on the Seine where they lit green flares in support of Greenpeace

Baffled: Tourists enjoying the Parisian sunshine looked bemused as the Ukrainian activists ran topless around the boat daubed in slogans that read 'Hang Captain Putin'
