The skillful Santi Cazorla has proven to be a formidable fixture in the Arsenal team for opposition defenders  this season, and now he's even turned his talents on his own teammates.

The Spanish playmaker showed off his incredible talent in a keepy-ups battle with fellow countryman and Gunners left-back Nacho Monreal.

The 28-year-old full-back posted a video of the duo to his Twitter account of them playing a one-touch passing competition.

The two Spaniards played the match in the Arsenal gym and Monreal said it was 'impossible' to beat Cazorla

The footage shows the two Spaniards in Arsenal's gym playing the ball across to each other in the air with just one touch of control allowed. 

Cazorla ends up victorious as Monreal's last pass comes up short, leading the loser to write: 'Playing with @19SCazorla. Impossible to beat him.'

The Gunners midfielder will hope his skills will help Arsenal to beat a rejuvenated Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park on Saturday. 

Alan Pardew's side come off the back of a 2-1 defeat to Liverpool, but prior to that Palace had won five in seven. 

Cazorla played a pivotal part in Arsenal's 2-0 victory over Middlesbrough in the fifth round of the FA Cup
