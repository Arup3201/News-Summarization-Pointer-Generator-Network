As conflict rages around Syria, rebel groups have been using a range outlandish devices as fighting continues in besieged cities.

The Free Syrian Army have little access to big weapons apart from small arms such as machine guns and often have to make their own ammunition.

Today fighters on the Syrian coast were pictured firing Grad long distance shells towards forces loyal to president Bashar Al-Assad.

Rebel fighters have little access to big weapons and sophisticated ammunition and often make their own

The shells were being fired towards the government forces in the city of Jableh from the Jabal al-Akrad area in north western Latakia province.

Grad shells were first developed in Russia and can travel over large distances.

Members of the Free Syrian Army were seen preparing the shells before loading them into a rocket launcher.

They then retreat to safety while one man has the task of using a remote detonator to fire off the explosive.

Yesterday, rebels were pictured firing a homemade weapon known as a 'hell cannon' in the city of Aleppo

The Grad shells that were being fired today are more powerful and sophisticated compared to the improvised explosives other rebels are relying on.

In the besieged city of Aleppo yesterday, a homemade weapon dubbed the 'hell cannon' was being used to fire out highly modified propane gas cylinders.

The rebel groups are said to take great pride in the cannon, which they developed themselves, which has a range of about a mile.

Fighters using the cannon are also made to watch online videos detailing how it is assembled and given a fact sheet on how to fire it.

Meanwhile ISIS terrorists who are battling with Kurdish fighters for control of the Syrian town of Kobane on the Turkish border have also been pictured using unconventional guns.

One jihadist has been pictured aiming a 10-foot long sniper rifle out of a flat window, which was so big it had to be supported on two tripods.

The gun fires 23mm calibre bullets, that are three times the size of standard rifle ammo, with huge casings from the bullets, lying on the floor next to the gunman.

What sort of effect this gun would have remains open to debate, however, according to firearms expert David Dyson.

He told MailOnline: 'The problem with identifying the effect of this gun is firstly that we don't know for sure what the calibre is, although there wouldn't be a lot of point in building something like this if it wasn't of a significant calibre. 

'Secondly, and probably of more importance, we don't know how well it is made: is the barrel accurately machined and rifled?

'The effect will also depend on the type of ammunition used. These rounds exist [23mm] fitted with high explosive incendiary or armour piercing incendiary projectiles.They will be effective against personnel and vehicles including lightly armoured ones.'
