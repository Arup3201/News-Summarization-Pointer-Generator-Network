RIP: Colonel Meow, dubbed the 'World's Angriest Cat,' but an internet sensation nonetheless, died on Wednesday

'Colonel Meow passed away yesterday evening,' Meow's owner wrote on the cat's official Facebook account.

'I will post more about the details when I've had a few days to grieve. Thank you so much for your understanding, Minions. Your love and support has meant the world to us both. -Slave Beast'

Followers of Colonel Meow, whose Facebook page had gained some 350,000 likes, were jokingly referred to as his 'minions.' His owner Anne Marie Avey called herself 'slave-beast.'

Avey had only just reached out to Meow's minions in November, when the cat suddenly fell ill and required expensive treatment.

Somber: Colonel Meow's owner made the somber announcement Wednesday, but asked for some time to grieve before going into detail as to the cause

Esteemed: In addition to being the 'World's Angriest Cat,' Meow held the distinction of being the world's longest haired cat, according to the Guinness Book of World Records

Popular: Colonel Meow's social media accounts were liked, viewed and followed by millions and ranked him among the internet's favorite cat alongside Lil' Bub and Grumpy Cat

'Colonel needs YOU,' Avey wrote. 'He has been in the hospital and the doctors don't really understand what's wrong with him,

'He has already survived a 50/50 chance surgery, a blood transfusion that they THOUGHT would send him into heart failure and now we need YOU to get him out of the woods. Spread that frown and send your recovery and healing vibes ASAP. He told me it was an order.'

Apparently good vibes and the astonishing $20,000 that was raised to cover medical care weren't enough.

Colonel Meow was adopted as a rescue cat after Avey found him on the side of the road in Seattle.
