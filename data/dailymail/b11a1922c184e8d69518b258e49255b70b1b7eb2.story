Renovation of a landmark Los Angeles restaurant has revealed a neon lamp that has been left on for around 77 years.

The light, forgotten for decades, was discovered burning brightly behind a dusty wall in the woman’s restroom in Clifton’s Cafeteria.

The surprising discovery was made as the building’s owner, Andrew Meieran, as he undertakes a multimillion renovation of the historic building.

Mr Meieran told the Los Angeles Times that the light was likely installed in 1935, after the building was bought and converted into a forest-themed dining establishment.

Much of the restaurant featured translucent, hand-painted forest murals that were backlit by neon panels such as the one found.

He told KTLA that it was nothing short of ‘staggering’ that the light has survived from the end of the Great Depression until now.

‘The fact it’s been tucked away and it’s so simple in its construction has kept it going all these years – it’s just neon gas and glass.’

He also hypothesised that the bulb generated more than $17,000 in electrical bills.

The nook where the neon light was found was covered over in plastic and plywood when part of the restroom was partitioned off as a storage area.

But for some reason, no one disconnected the electricity.

California is also home to the world’s longest burning light bulb. Known as the Centennial Light, the bulb has been burning for 110 years strong.

The hand-blown bulb was first installed at the fire department on L Street, and survived several renovations. It hangs in the fire house in Livermore to this day.

Neon experts agree that it is rare for a neon bulb to burn for more than 40 years and that this one – which has been burning nearly twice as long – could be the oldest working neon light in the world.

Mr Meieran is currently renovating the 47,000-foot space, keeping a careful eye toward the building’s historic details. In fact, he’ll be using Clifford Clinton’s diary to make sure every aspect is correct.

Clifton’s Cafeteria was an important building in the landscape of Los Angeles, offering hungry families the option to ‘pay what you can’ for dinner during the throes of the Depression.

According to Blogs Downtown, Mr Meieran plans to keep the massive cafeteria open 24/7 once renovations are complete.

The long-hidden neon will be on proud display, with a replica transparency over part of it.
