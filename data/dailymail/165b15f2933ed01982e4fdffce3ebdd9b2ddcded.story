A female employee with the U.S. Department of State who was vacationing in Brazil was found strangled in a hotel room in Rio de Janeiro last week, police revealed Thursday.

Victoria Tcaciuc, 38, had been travelling through the South American country and was discovered by staff of the hotel, which is located in the Copacabana neighborhood.

The Rio police homicide division have named Brazilian ex-firefighter Alessandro Rufino Oliveira Carvalho, 42, as the main suspect in the murder. Police say he was captured on security camera video entering her hotel.

Carvalho, who served eight years in prison for an assault charge, denies the murder charge and said that he left the American traveller alone and alive in her room on February 20.

‘In the hotel, all she wanted to do was smoke a cigarette and watch television,’ he said, according to Brazilian newspaper The O Globo. ‘There was no sex and when I left, she was very much alive.’

The two had apparently met at a crafts fair, had lunch, and went to the Casa Blanca hotel.

Security footage shows the blonde Tacaciuc walking behind Carvalho into the hotel lobby.

It appears that Carvalho did most of the talking with the hotel's attendant, at one point reaching for his wallet and handing the man several bills.

Rivaldo Barbosa, the head of the city’s homicide division, told reporters: ‘We suspect that he killed her because she refused to have sex with him.’

Barbosa said Carvalho left the hotel less than an hour after entering and traveled to Sao Paulo.

Carvalho was arrested Thursday when as he was returning to Rio.

It is unclear when Tcaciuc arrived in Brazil, but Barbosa said the woman was planning to visit at least four other cities before returning to the U.S. on March 4. 

She was divorced and had no children.

The press office of the U.S. Consulate in Rio said Tcaciuc was a contract employee of the State Department.

Citing privacy act considerations, the consulate did not provide her hometown or other information, though Brazilian reports state that she lived and worked in Washington, D.C.

A State Department official told MailOnline in a statement: ‘We were deeply saddened to learn of the death of Department of State contractor Victoria Tcaciuc.  

‘We express our deepest condolences to her friends and loved ones. Officials from the U.S. Consulate in Rio de Janeiro are providing all appropriate consular assistance,’ adding that local authorities were handling details of Ms Tcaciuc’s murder.
