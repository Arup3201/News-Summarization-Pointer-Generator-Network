A Bangladeshi student has been found guilty of raping a 14-year-old schoolgirl within weeks of moving to the UK.

Ferdoush Hasan, 22, raped the vulnerable girl at his house in Beaufront Terrace, South Shields, in February last year.

He led the girl, who had drunk half a litre of vodka, to a room in another part of the house from her friends, where he forced himself on her and raped her.

Hasan, Abu Sufian, 21, and Raabsan Khan, 19, were all found not guilty of a second joint charge of rape, during which Sufian and Khan were alleged to have held down another girl while Hasan raped her.

After hearing the guilty verdict, Hasan sobbed with his head in his hands, before being led away into custody.

It took the jury just over three hours to reach the unanimous verdicts this afternoon.

Tom Moran, defending Hasan, asked that his client, who has no previous convictions, be sentenced immediately.

However, Judge Simon Hickey said that Hasan would be sentenced after the preparation of a probation report.

Hasan came to the UK on January 18 or 19 last year to study an HND in nautical science at South Tyneside College.

The following month he raped the schoolgirl at the house that he shared with 13 other Bangladeshi students.

Throughout his police interviews, Hasan lied about knowing the victim and denied having sex with her.

During the trial, however, he claimed to have had consensual sex with the teenager, although he said he thought she was 17.

He said that he had previously lied to police because he was 'afraid' and 'no-one was looking after him'.

During the five-day trial at Newcastle Crown Court, Hasan's victim told how she feared she was pregnant with his baby.

The girl's mother told how her daughter 'went off the rails' after the rape and had begun to self harm and even talked about taking her grandfather's tablets.

The troubled teenager was taken to a doctor by a school counsellor but the pregnancy test was negative.

Hasan, of Ocean Road, South Shields, will be sentenced at a later hearing.

Khan and Sufian, also of Ocean Road, South Shields, were escorted from court by police, due to a large English Defence League (EDL) presence outside the building.
