Jailed: Alexander Oades, 20, his girlfriend and friend lured their victim to a flat in Hull, East Yorkshire

A gang who subjected a man to two hours of humiliation and threats has been jailed for more than seven years.

The trio ordered Christopher Hipkiss, 24, to take all his clothes off and eat potpourri in a row about a missing £90.

Alexander Oades, 20, his girlfriend Holly Norman, 22, and friend Jamie Mullenger, 20, lured Mr Hipkiss to a flat in Hull, East Yorkshire, and subjected him to almost two hours of humiliation and threats.

Oades held a knife to Mr Hipkiss’s face ordered him to strip, before forcing him to eat the potpourri and cutting up his clothes because he thought Mr Hipkiss had stolen £90 from one of the gang,  Hull Crown Court was told.

Recorder Nick Barker has now jailed the three culprits for a total of seven and a half years.

In a statement read in court, Mr Hipkiss said: ‘I was humiliated, tortured and held against my will. I want them to know this is not acceptable.

‘I never want them to do this to anyone else. I have never been so scared in my life.’

Oades cut Mr Hipkiss’s clothes during his ordeal last April and told him: ‘Look how easy the knife cuts through your clothes, think what it will do to you.’

Mr Hipkiss, 24, said: ‘Alex pulled out a knife, it looked like a shaving razor. He looked angry and was very intense and glaring at me.

‘He held the knife towards my head and told me to get undressed. I was so scared, I didn’t question him. Alex said if I didn’t get the money, he would stab me.

‘I didn’t scream for help, as I was so frightened about what was happening. At one point, Alex held the knife to me and told me to eat potpourri or he would stab me.

‘I ate some of it, it tasted awful. I didn’t feel I had a choice. They were playing with me, trying to humiliate me. I was shaking with fear. I have never been so frightened.

'I honestly thought they were going to kill me. I didn’t take their money but I was so frightened I thought if I give them their money they might leave me alone.’

Involved: Norman and Mullenger (pictured left and right at earlier court appearances last year), also took part and both pleaded guilty to false imprisonment

Recorder Barker sentenced Oades and Mullenger to two years and nine months of imprisonment and Norman to two years in jail.

He told them: ‘It is clear your intention was to detain him and make threats to him with weapons. You made threats and carried out degrading conduct towards him.

'A knife was produced and held towards him, threats were made and he was told to strip down to his boxer shorts and he was made to eat potpourri.

‘When the police arrived, he was in a terrifying state and it is hardly surprising given what had occurred.’
