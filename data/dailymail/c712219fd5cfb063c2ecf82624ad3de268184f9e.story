Humans fear people, animals and objects approaching them (illustrated), even if the person is not threatening, experts claim

In our struggle to survive, humans have learned that something approaching us, such as a dangerous animal or a person, is more of a threat than one that is moving away from us.

And while we don’t have to worry too much about attacks by ferocious animals - in cities at least - this type of fear still plays a large part in our day-to-day lives.

Experts have found that humans still have negative feelings about people, animals and objects approaching them, even if the person is not threatening.

‘In order to survive, humans have developed a tendency to guard against animals, people and objects that come near them,’ said Christopher Hsee of the University of Chicago Booth School of Business.

‘This is true for things that are physically coming closer, but also for events that are approaching in time or increasing in likelihood.’

In a study published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, Professor Hsee and students from Chicago Booth and the University of Wisconsin, suggested that this fear, which they have called ‘approach avoidance,’ is an innate tendency.

The scientists conducted eight tests to investigate their thesis and found that even nonthreatening objects and people evoked negative feelings as they moved closer.

Even seemingly docile entities, such as deer, had a fear factor attached to them since participants could still attach some uncertainty to a wild animal's behaviour.

‘Approach avoidance is a general tendency, humans don't seem to adequately distinguish between times they should use it and when they should not,’ Professor Hsee said.

‘They tend to fear approaching things and looming events even if objectively they need not fear.’

The scientists think their research has interesting implications and uses in a number of areas.

Marketing experts could use the information to determine if they should gradually move a product closer to viewers in a television commercial, or whether that could harm the image of the product, the scientists explained.

Similarly, speakers who tend to move closer and closer toward their audiences during their speeches should think twice, as doing so may cast an unfavourable impression on listeners, they said.
