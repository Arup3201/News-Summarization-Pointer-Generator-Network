You won't leave Columbia. Not for a long time, anyway.

As from the moment you're launched into the sky-high dystopia, Bioshock Infinite's vice-like grip takes hold, and won't let you go.

You play Booker DeWitt, a former agent with the Pinkerton Detective agency. He's sent to the floating city in search of a young woman called Elizabeth, who's been held captive there for 12 years. To make matters worse, she's guarded by an enormous robo-bird called the Songbird, and the city's in the middle of a civil war - not helped by main antagonist, Zachary Comstock.

What a view: There's no denying that Infinite looks great but to get the most out of it you have to play on PC

Cue typical Bioshock gameplay - where combat revolves around a combination of weapons and powers, as Booker and Elizabeth try to escape from Columbia.

Not that you'd want to, given just how beautiful the game looks. Whether it's admiring the quaint, Venetian splendor of the architecture, or just watching Columbia's dwellers get on with their lives, Infinite's art direction alone stands head and shoulders above most other stuff out there. It must be said, though, that the game's visuals fall victim of aging console hardware.

Whereas 'Ultra' settings on PC captures every intricate detail, maintains a smooth framerate and just feels 'alive', consoles look flat in comparison - with bland textures, some minor framerate hiccups and uninspiring character models.

What has evolved, though, is the combat. Although you start the game on your own, you'll soon have Elizabeth as a companion. You can ask her to teleport certain features - be that a turret or a stash of medical supplies.

Run low on ammo, and she'll even toss you some clips. Infinite lets you play how you want to, and given how reliant you are on Elizabeth, you soon feel compelled to protect her. In fact, Infinite is the first game in a while where the player isn't the star. This is Elizabeth's show - and Irrational Games have made sure her AI always takes the lead and dictates the pace between gunfights.

Sadly, it's not perfect. You'll see her launch ammo through solid walls, her movement can be extremely unnatural and stiff and she'll sometimes get in the way.

Perhaps most annoying is when you run out of health and she rescues you - locking you into the same, boring revival sequence that gets tiresome very quickly.

Blown away: Along with a variety of man-made weapons, Booker can use Vigor to devastating effect

A new feature in Infinite is the skyline system - a rollercoaster-like rail network that allows you to hook on and traverse areas quickly. It's fast enough to give a real sensation of speed, but you always feel in control.

This gives battles a multi-layered aspect. Either go in all guns blazing at ground level, or zip to a high structure and snipe - the choice is yours, and it all feels much more refined than, say, Dishonored.

Bioshock Infinite looks its best on PC. Our testing unit runs on an Nvidia 680GTX graphics card - which allows the game to run at the highest settings with a smooth framerate. The cheaper 670GTX model is a powerful alternative. The AMD Radeon XFX card may be worth a look, too, for those chasing top-quality graphics.

The impressive array of powers - called vigors - more than make up for the slightly unoriginal armoury of pistols and shotguns.

Gone are Adam and Eve, replaced by Salt. These allow you to cast fireballs, launch a flock of hungry birds and shoot electricity from your fingertips. All are a joy to use, each one resulting in their own gruesome fatalities.

Enemy AI generally works well - preferring the 'charge on sight' approach. Sometimes, though, they'll casually walk past their dead comrades or get jammed in the scenery.

No matter, as Infinite is at its best away from the frantic, and slightly repetitive, combat. The opening 20-or-so minutes when you're walking around Columbia like a lost tourist is one of the most memorable sections of recent years.

Bioshock Infinite may not be perfect, but it more than deserves its place nestled in the gaming stratosphere.

Bioshock Infinite is out now.
