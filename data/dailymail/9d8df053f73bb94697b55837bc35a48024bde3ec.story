A Virginia college sophomore used the simple disguise of a suit and orange tie from Walmart to sneak onto the court with University of Virginia basketball staff just before their historic win against Duke in Greensboro, North Carolina on Sunday.

Just before the Cavaliers clenched the ACC title for the first time in 40 years, the teen named Danny marched past an usher and proceeded to enjoy the thrilling championship game alongside coaches and players alike.

He even joined a team huddle.

Danny Foley, who attends James Madison University, shared his story, along with the hilarious photos that prove it, to sports blog Barstool.

He said he noticed that all the UVA assistant coaches wore the same suit with orange tie getup while watching the team play Pittsburgh the day before.

He and friends immediately went searching for some cheap knockoffs.

'Goodwill was closed but we bought everything at walmart,' he told Barstool.

He purchased everything there: 'Everything Includes: suit jacket, suit pants, dress shoes, dress socks (3 Pack), white dress shirt, orange tie,' Danny said.

Brazen: 'Buzzer sounds and i walked onto the middle and confetti was falling,' he said. 'I just hop in the back of the handshake line, first one is coach K, followed by Jeff coaches and all the players. After that I went and ran into UVA manager passing out hats and shirts.'

The next morning, he bought $30 nosebleed tickets just to get him in the door and headed to the game.

During a TV timeout, Danny made a move.

'I walked right behind the cheerleaders and onto the court and joined the UVA huddle on the court,' he said.

With the help of his 6ft 2in stature, not to mention brazenness, Danny managed to do something basketball fans everywhere could only dream.

For the rest of the game, he went back and forth between sitting courtside and enjoying the game with his family.

Following the teams big win, he went in for an even bigger thrill.

'Buzzer sounds and i walked onto the middle and confetti was falling,' said the UVA fan. 'I just hop in the back of the handshake line, first one is coach K, followed by Jeff coaches and all the players.

'After that I went and ran into UVA manager passing out hats and shirts.'

Photos from the end of the game show Danny wearing a championship t-shirt over his suit and smiling in the middle of the confetti-covered arena.

After celebrating with coaches and players, Danny was caught by a member of the UVA staff, but before he could get into any trouble he climbed some railings into the stands.

'Found my family a minute later and within 10 minutes we were in the car and on the way home,' he said.

As astounding as Danny's feat was, he told WWBT that he did it once before when his brother played basketball for Princeton.

Years earlier, he donned his brother's practice jersey and watched a game that was coincidentally also against Duke.

He said no one said a thing, but admits last week's game crash was a much bigger deal.
