A mother listened to an answerphone message recording the final moments of her daughter – who was sent home by a GP who ‘wouldn’t give her the time of day’.

The walk-in-centre doctor carried out a ‘substandard’ examination on 20-year-old Evelyn Purchase, failing to notice that she had pneumonia, a coroner ruled.

Barely 36 hours later, and as the arts student lay dying in bed, she tried to call her mother Tara but was forced to leave a message on her mobile.

Tragic: Evelyn Purchase (left) was found dead just hours after a doctor failed to diagnose her pneumonia. Her mother Tara (right) says she found a voicemail message of her daughter's final moments after she died

Speaking yesterday, Miss Purchase 
said: ‘Evelyn was still poorly the day after her trip to the doctor, 
which was my birthday, and she decided to stay at home while I went out 
with her sister, Dana.

‘We came home and I went to check on Evelyn, and found her  lifeless in her bedroom, clutching the phone.

‘My heart broke in two and I will never get over it.

‘I
 later realised I had a voicemail message and when I listened to it, I 
realised that Evelyn had tried to call me and I could hear her dying in 
the message.

‘She has left a huge hole in all of our lives, and we will never get over her death.’

Coroner
 Robin Balmain said a number of assumptions were made by the doctor 
about the talented illustrator’s condition and that the assessment had 
been ‘less than optimal’.

Treatment: Evelyn Purchase was given antibiotics despite failing to respond to the medication on two previous occasions, and anti-depressants despite not being given a proper mental health examination

Less than optimal: Dr Mahmud Ahmed of Holly Hill clinic in Dudley (pictured) was criticised for level of care he provided. Evelyn Purchase died after her pneumonia was misdiagnosed as a chest infection

Recording a narrative verdict, he stopped short of saying Evelyn’s death could have been prevented.

But he added: ‘This is a tragedy. This is the death of a young girl at the start of her adult life.

‘It
 seems to me that what went  on during the course of that examination 
was probably incomplete.’ Evelyn, a second year student at Hereford 
College of Arts, visited a doctor at Holly Hall walk-in centre in 
Dudley, West Midlands, on April 5 last year, with her mother,  
complaining that she felt unwell.

Mahmud Ahmed, who had previously treated Evelyn, diagnosed her with a chest infection and  prescribed antibiotics.

He failed to realise he had already given her two courses of antibiotics which had failed to work.

Believing
 depression to be the cause of her loss of appetite, he also prescribed 
anti-depressants – without carrying out a mental health examination.

Dr
 Ahmed told the inquest: ‘I did not check her oxygen levels as she was 
not unduly short of breath. I thought that the infection was not so 
serious for her to be admitted to hospital.’

Miss
 Purchase, whose daughter Dana is 16, said: ‘I will never be able to 
forgive myself for not being there for her when she needed me. I wish 
someone had told us how ill she was.

Talented: Evelyn Purchase was a second year illustration student at Hereford College of Arts. She hoped her work (pictured) would one day get her a job at video games manufacturer Sega

‘We
 begged the doctor to send her for a chest X-ray, but he wouldn’t. 
Evelyn was such a bright, clever young girl and she had her head screwed
 on.

‘She was a shy 
character who  concentrated on her studies, rarely partied, and she 
never lost focus of her achieving her ambitions.

‘We
 were incredibly close and she had never been kissed, didn’t have a 
boyfriend because she knew where she wanted to go in life and knew that 
she required focus to do so.’

The
 maths and English teacher from Halesowen, who has divorced Evelyn’s 
father David, plans to bring the case before the General Medical 
Council.

‘I’m not saying 
that she wasn’t treated but she was not treated appropriately for her 
condition and, as a consequence, she died on my bed, in my bedroom, in 
unbelievably bad circumstances,’ she said.

‘If she had been placed into  hospital she would have had the opportunity to fight for her life.

‘I’d
 taken Evelyn to a few doctors’ appointments in the days before her 
death and we went to the walk-in centre as her condition severely 
worsened – but I just feel he didn’t have the time of day for us.’

Cause
 of death at the inquest in Smethwick on Monday was given as extensive 
bilateral pneumonia with pulmonary abscesses as a  contributing factor.
