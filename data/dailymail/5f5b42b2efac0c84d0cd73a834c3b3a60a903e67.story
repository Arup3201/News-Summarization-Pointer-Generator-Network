Sometimes all you need in life, as suggested by legendary Disney slacker Baloo the Bear, is the bare necessities. 

This brown bear appears to follow the lead of her idol, as she scratches her back against a tree, mimicking the much-loved cartoon bear.

Although in this case, the bear with an itch is far from Kipling's India, enjoying a self-made grooming session in a forest in northern Finland.

After using the tree-trunk, the female bear uses a giant branch to scratch, and she looks the spitting image of Baloo from the famous scene in the Rudyard Kipling inspired Disney movie. 

Jamen Percy, from London, spotted the bear during a trip to northern Finland, while watching the bears activity discreetly from an armoured hide.

He said: 'It was like a scene straight out of Jungle Book with Baloo scratching himself on the tree.

'Although this was a different species of bear, they all seem to love a good tree scratch.'

Mr Percy spent hours covertly covering the trees in honey in a bid to attract the bears.

He then retreated to the camouflaged hide around 30ft away where he patiently waited, finally capturing the bears in action three hours later.

Mr Percy added: 'I was at the mercy of the bears. I was alone in this hide, which the bears could very easily dismantle if they wanted to.

'There were several precautions I had to undertake to make sure there were no traces of honey left on my hands which could attract the bears.

'They absolutely love honey and nothing will get in their way when they smell it, so it was very important not to have a single trace of the stuff on me.

'But I was still on edge. Bears have an incredible bite force and strength well capable of crushing most man made objects.'

Mr Percy says he honed the techniques he used to capture these intimate images during repeated trips to the remote Finnish forest.

He said: 'I have visited this area for three years in a row and had many great encounters.

'Basically the area is run by a wilderness centre in the north of Finland. You trek into the forest away from any civilisation, they then lock you in a hide and leave you.

'You live among the bears for a night. The guides come and collect you in the morning at 7am when the bears are sleeping.'
