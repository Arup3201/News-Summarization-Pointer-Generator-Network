Whole Foods markets are re-evaluating their English language-only policy after two employees who questioned it were suspended at an Albuquerque, New Mexico store.

It all started at a recent employee meeting at the Whole Foods store located on Wyoming Boulevard when a manager brought up the store's policy. The manager said that Spanish was not to be spoken during work hours.

Two employees, Bryan Baldizan and Lupe Gonzales, wrote a letter to the manager questioning the policy.

Don't speak: Whole Foods is facing heavy criticism after two employees were suspended at an Albuquerque, New Mexico, market for complaining about the company's English language-only policy

'I could not understand how for Cinco de Mayo, we dressed employees up in sarapes and sombreros with fake mustaches but the language that is connected with that was suddenly forbidden,' Baldizan wrote in the letter.

Soon after both Baldizan and Gonzales were put on suspension.

'I couldn't believe it,' Baldizan told the AP. 'All we did was say we didn't believe the policy was fair. We only talk Spanish to each other about personal stuff, not work.'

Libba Letton, spokesman for Whole Foods, refutes that Baldizan and Gonzales were suspended for complaining about the policy. Instead, Letton says, they were suspended due to their behavior when meeting with the manager where they were 'rude and disrespectful' in an office.

'Their suspension was due to their behavior alone,' Letton said in a statement.

Suspended: Bryan Baldizan was one two Whole Foods employees suspended for speaking out against the language policy

Ben Friedland, the Rocky Mountain region executive marketing director for Whole Foods, explained that the policy only states that employees speak English with other customers and workers when on the clock, unless the customer speaks another language.

'Team members are free to speak any language they would like during their breaks, meal periods and before and after work,' Friedland said.

Friedland went on to say that the policy doesn't prevent Spanish-speaking if all 'parties present agree that a different language is their preferred form of communication.'

The policy, Letton says, was put in place for safety reasons and so customers and other employees don't feel uncomfortable.

The actual policy: A copy of the store's language policy shows that there is some flexibility as to when languages other than English can be spoken

Still, the Austin, Texas-based company is investigating the incident, and is in the process of evaluating the policy 'as we speak,' according to Letton. The policy, she says, will be a topic of conversation at the company's leadership conference next week.

'I'm glad they are willing to re-evaluate that policy because I think every state is different,' said New Mexico Governor Susana Martinez.

The Spanish language, Gov. Martinez says, 'is part of the fabric of what makes New Mexico great.'

The company still faces heavy-criticism from the New Mexico League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC). The director of the organization, Ralph Arellanes said Thursday he will give the company seven days to implement a new policy 'or we will hold them accountable.'

Letton said the company will speak to civil rights groups when reviewing the policy.

'We are also in the process of reaching out to groups like LULAC to discuss the issue and hear their perspective,' Letton said.
