Media mogul Oprah Winfrey has opened up about her take on the protests born out of the recent Eric Garner and Michael Brown grand jury decisions.

While discussing her new Golden Globe nominated film that details major events that unfolded during the civil rights era, Winfrey said the recent marches are a 'wake-up call.'

'I think everything is a wake-up call if you're paying attention,' she told USA Today. 'Everything is happening all the time to get our attention. And when you don't listen the first time, it becomes more and more forceful.

Wake up call:While discussing her new Golden Globe nominated film that details major events that unfolded during the civil rights era, Winfrey said the recent marches are a 'wake-up call'

'So if you didn't listen to Ferguson, then along comes Eric Garner.'

The 60-year-old trailblazer said the recent demonstrations are a sign that the teachings of Martin Luther King, who is portrayed in Selma by actor David Oyelowo, still ring true through to today. 

She said the protesters 'understand that adage of Dr. King is really true: That injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. And that's why people are marching in the streets.'

She stars in and produced the new film Selma about the fight for voting rights spearheaded by Martin Luther King Jr.

And Oprah Winfrey pulled out all the stops fashion wise as she attended the premiere in New York on Sunday.

In Selma, Oprah plays activist Annie Lee Cooper, a 54-year-old woman who punched a county sheriff, Jim Clark, for not allowing her to register to vote.

Oprah produced the film alongside executive producer Brad Pitt.

Selma is named after the town of Selma, Alabama, which denied black citizens the right to vote.

In the 1960s, it was the setting for a series of marches led by Martin Luther King Jr., of which one reached the state’s capitol, Montgomery. The peaceful uprising was met by violence and brutality.

Such efforts eventually culminated in President Lyndon B. Johnson (played by Tom Wilkinson) signing the 1965 Voting Rights Act, which outlawed racial discrimination in voting.

Oprah has discussed what got her involved in the project.

‘I was already putting my two cents in all the time and they said why don’t you just join us as a producer?’ she said at the movie’s debut at the AFI Fest in November.

Oprah was also close friends with Oyelowo, having bonded while working on 2013 film Lee Daniels' The Butler.

‘He showed me a tape that he had done and I said, “Yeah. I could see King in you. It’s not quite there. But I can see it’s on its way there.” That’s what got me to say yes.’

Oyelowo described the roots and culture of his people as he discovered it when living in Nigeria.

‘The thing I learned living in Nigeria is exactly what is said in the film — that we are born of kings. We are a people of deep pride, incredible culture and indescribable power,’ he said.

‘And unfortunately, on the continents of both Europe and America, that has been denigrated over time. I don’t think it’s any accident that somehow this great man’s name was King.’

Selma will enjoy a limited release on Christmas day before hitting theatres nationwide on January 9, 2015.
