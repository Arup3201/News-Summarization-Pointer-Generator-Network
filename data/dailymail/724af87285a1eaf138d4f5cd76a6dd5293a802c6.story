Australia has officially welcomed its largest ever warship to the Naval fleet in a ceremony at Sydney's Garden Island. 

Before a cheering crowd of more than 1500 on Friday, NUSHIP Canberra became the HMAS Canberra, entitled to fly the historical white ensign in the name of the nation.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott, Governor-General Sir Peter Cosgrove and Navy Chief Vice-Admiral Tim Barrett attended the ceremony, together with family members of the ship's 400-strong crew. 

PM Tony Abbott said it marked a proud day for the Navy and for Australia. 

'We are a nation girt by sea. So it is the Royal Australian Navy that guarantees the security of this continent, the free passage of our trade and the safety of our citizens,' he said.

The 27,000 tonne HMAS Canberra is  the largest ship ever built for the Australian Navy. On Friday, HMAS Canberra was commissioned at a ceremony on Sydney Harbour as the country's newest warship

Governor-General Sir Peter Cosgrove said commissioning is one of the most important ceremonies in the life of a warship. 

'From the date of commissioning, a warship is recognised under domestic and international law as a sovereign representative of its nation,' he told the crowd.

'From today, wherever she may travel in the world, Canberra is all-Australian. The ship and her crew are a part of our nation.'

'This is now your opportunity to proudly write a new chapter consistent with the finest traditions of the Royal Australian Navy and the wider Australian Defence Force,' he said.

 The 27,000 tonne HMAS Canberra is by far the largest and most expensive ship ever to be built for the Australian Navy. The amphibious vessel towers eight stories above sea level, its deck bigger than four Olympic sized swimming pools.

Built at a cost of $1.5 billion, the ship is the first of two  landing helicopter dock (LHD) ships for the Australian Navy. It's capable of transporting 18 helicopters and 2,000 fully armed personnel along with armoured vehicles and supplies.

HMAS Canberra dwarfs the navy's last aircraft carrier, the 20,000 tonne HMAS Melbourne.

The ship, built in Spain and fitted-out in Melbourne, was designed to support air, land and sea missions - but Captain John Sadleir says it will also be   deployed to respond to large-scale humanitarian   emergencies.

In the coming weeks, HMAS Canberra will depart Sydney to begin training in exercise areas on Australia's east coast.

'Initially we'll put the ship through its paces and the crew through its paces,' Captain Sadleirsaid, adding that he was 'humbled' to be put at the helm of the super vessel.

'What a superb opportunity and what an Australian outcome to have a part to play in, that is humbling,' he said

Canberra is the third vessel to bear this name. The first Canberra was lost at the World War II Battle of Savo Island in 1942. The second Canberra was retired in 2005 and then sunk as a dive wreck off Victoria.

The Australian Navy's second Landing Helicopter Deck, to be named HMAS Adelaide, is due to be commissioned in 2016.
