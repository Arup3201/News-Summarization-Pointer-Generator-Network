'Terrified': Anne Bass has testified against her former butler who allegedly held her hostage at her estate in Connecticut in 2007

Multimillionaire socialite Anne Bass has revealed she thought she was going to die when three armed men broke into her Connecticut home, howling 'war cries', brandishing knives and demanding cash.

Testifying in court against her former butler - allegedly one of the three men who attempted to steal millions of dollars from her - the 70-year-old wept as she remembered thinking how her murder would affect her two daughters.

She also recounted her fear on hearing the men enter the home, before she and her boyfriend Julian Lethbridge were bound and given an injection the intruders claimed was a deadly virus.

'I spent a lot of time thinking about my children and how horrible it 
was going to be for them because I was sure I was going to die,' she said.

'I just 
didn't see how anyone could survive something like that.'

Bass, the former wife of Texas billionaire Sid
Bass, also revealed her guilt that her three-year-old grandson was asleep in her home during the home invasion in 2007.

'I just felt like I had failed as a mother, that I would be in that kind of a position,' she told the court, the Hartford Courant reported.

She also revealed she stopped the men from kidnapping her grandson Jasper, by asking: 'Do any of you have children?' She added: 'I thought they would scream at me.'

But one of the intruders admitted he did have children. She told them her grandson would be forever frightened if he saw the three men dressed in black, and they did not take the boy.

Bass was in court to testify against Emanuel
Nicolescu, whom she had employed at her South Kent home for two months 
in 2008, and whom is accused of holding the pair hostage for 12 hours.

Authorities say Nicolescu and at least
two other men broke into the house around 11 p.m. on 
the estate that spans several hundred acres.

Bass 
had just taken a bath and Lethbridge was falling asleep when he heard 'a
loud crashing noise and a sound like boots running up steps', prosecutors said.

Bass failed to bar the invaders from getting in through the kitchen door. They
then blindfolded the victims, bound their hands and took 
them to a bathroom where they administered the 'poison'.

The masked assailants demanded the philanthropist pay $8.5 million for an antidote within 20 hours.

Testifying
on Tuesday, Bass added that she heard the men howling terrifying 'war 
cries' when they entered the home, the Harford Courant reported.

She had climbed out of the bath, dressed in a terry cloth robe and shuffled to the kitchen. Once there, she 'heard these war cries, very terrifying sounds' and saw hooded men storming the house.

Bass said: 'In my memory I see them in some kind of military formation like little 
children acting like Indians, beating their chests, trying to frighten 
you.'

She screamed for Lethbridge and attempted to run, but the men grabbed her and bound her wrists.

Bass's testimony comes days after her boyfriend
told the court he thought he would die when three men ‘dressed like 
ninjas’ broke into the philanthropist's mansion and 'poisoned' them.

‘It felt like a flu shot,’ he said. 
‘They injected me by sterilizing my shoulder, exactly like an 
inoculation…I thought it was poisonous or they were putting me to sleep.'

Wielding
a knife, one of the assailants announced that they had been injected 
with a ‘very virulent virus’ with symptoms taking 20-24 hours to appear.

‘When the symptoms appear, it’s almost certain to be fatal,’ Lethbridge recalled the thugs saying.

He told the 
men Bass did not keep that sum of money in the house and that she would 
have to contact associates out of state to get the money.

Prosecutors said that Nicolescu, his 
former roomate Nicolae Helerea, aka Michael Kennedy, and Stefan Barabas 
talked on either cellphones or two-way radios.

After
about five hours in the house, the men became concerned with the 
presence of the child, the health of the victims and their apparent 
inability to immediately obtain the money, the affidavit says.

Before 
fleeing, the men gave the victims a beverage that they claimed was the 
antidote and the victims fell asleep.

Nicolescu, who was fired by Bass after 
he wrecked one of her cars he was using without permission, faces 50 
years in prison if convicted of the home invasion.

Nicolescu's lawyer Audrey Felsen previously told jurors that the butler 'did not do the crimes. He did not participate in them, He didn't plan them. He didn't help anybody plan them. He didn't knowingly help anybody after the fact.'
