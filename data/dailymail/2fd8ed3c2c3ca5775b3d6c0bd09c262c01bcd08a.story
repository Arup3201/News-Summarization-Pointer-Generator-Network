Gay Blogger Micheal Rogers has made it his mission to out
closeted gay politicians who publicly vote against gay rights.

Wyoming Senator John Barrasso was Rogers' next target. On
Sept,29 Micheal Rogers tweeted a response to Barasso's negative opinion about single-payer healthcare which the senator expressed on Fox news on Sunday.

He said:

This tweet was aimed at Barrasso after the Senator bashed Obama's economic plan on Fox on Sunday

Senate Budget Committee ranking minority member Sen. Jeff Sessions and Republican Policy Committee Chairman John Barrasso read a copy of Obama's budget plan

The Daily Dot reports that Senator Barrasso is a 61-year-old Presbyterian and a
remarried father of three. He openly speaks against gay right's and women's
rights. He's been divorced once. Barrasso is on Facebook and on Twitter.

The Washington Post reports that in 2004 Barrasso said, 'I
believe in limited government, lower taxes, less spending, traditional family
values, local control and a strong national defense...'

He continued, 'In the state Senate, in addition to receiving
an 'A' rating from the NRA, I have voted for prayer in schools, against gay
marriage and have sponsored legislation to protect the sanctity of life.'

Rogers was once named
by The Washington Post as, 'the most feared man on [Capitol] Hill' for his
perfect track record of outing ultra-conservative gay politicians.

Over the past ten years he's outed Larry, Craig, Mark Foley,
David Dreier, Ken Mehlman, Edward Schrock, Ed Koch, and Charlie Crist.

Rep. David Dreier was reported gay by Micheal Rogers

Florida Governor Charlie Crist is also a gay politician who Rogers exposed

U.S. Senator Larry Craig was also one of Rogers unlucky political targets

Rogers runs a tip-line called BlogActive, a site aimed
at shedding light on hypocritical lawmakers.

Rogers was also the main attraction in Kirby Dick's 2009
documentary entitled, 'Outrage.' The film followed Rogers as he outed gay politicians.

Rogers is known to out politicians way before media outlets
share information with the public.

According to Rogers, he is not trying to expose politicians
for personal satisfaction, he outs them to point out how their political
decisions don't mirror their behavior.

He started investigating and outing politicians in February
of 2004 out of anger for Karl Rove and Ken Mehlman. He claimed they were
running marriage amendments to get Bush back into office.

Rogers acknowledges how social media has changed the way
politicians and ordinary people communicate. Rogers uses his twitter account as
a tool to poke fun at those who seek to poke out rights of others.

'The explosion of social media as a primary form of
communication has been a double-edged sword,' said Rogers.

'On one hand, it's a wonderful tool for people to reach out,
make connections, share news, and conduct research. On the other hand, we have
seen the damage that misinformation on the Web can cause. Stock market plummets
and unfairly ruined reputations are just two of the consequences of this
shift,' he continued.

Rogers takes responsibility for showing corruption in
government only when politicians act irresponsibly by using their political viewpoints to hide their identity.

He states, 'People are entitled to privacy and the exposure
of someone's sexual orientation without their permission is unacceptable to me.
Reporting on the hypocrisy of those who represent us in government? That's an
entirely different matter.'

Mark Rogers said that over the years his feelings of anger
have turned into pity. He recognizes that some people are trying to lead
truthful lives.

He makes an example, of
former New Jersey Senator Jim McGreevy who he says, ‘taught us a very important
lesson.’

Rogers mentions how years ago, politicians would say they were corrupt to
hide that fact that they were gay, and now they come out as gay to mask their
corruption.

Who is Mark Rogers' next target?

Tea Party Congressman Adrian Smith is under fire.  He voted against reauthorizing the Violence
Against Women Act and against repealing Don’t Ask Don’t Tell, as did Barrasso.
Rogers tweeted at him on Sept. 30:
