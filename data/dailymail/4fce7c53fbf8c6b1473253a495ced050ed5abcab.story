A pastor at a mega-church has signed a plea agreement for his role in a relationship with a then-16-year-old church member after he was was charged with taking a minor across state lines.

Dr Jack Schaap, 54, had been pastor of the First Baptist Church of Hammond in Indiana for 11 years, but was let go in July after a deacon saw a text on his phone from the teenager, allegedly with a picture of the two of them kissing.

He was charged in criminal court yesterday after he admitted to adultery and 'improper behavior' with the teenager, who is now 17, leading a
board of deacons to fire him last month.

Dismissed: Dr Jack Schaap, who was the pastor of First Baptist Church in Hammond for more than a decade, was let go in August

Caught: A deacon of First Baptist Church saw a picture on Schaap's phone from a teenage girl; the picture allegedly showed the two kissing

In the plea agreement, he admitted he 
had sex with the girl, that she was under his care or supervision and 
that he used a computer to persuade the girl to have sex with him 
illegally.

The court heard that Schaap had a 
relationship between June 1 and July 30 with a girl who had not yet 
turned 18, and took her from Indiana to Illinois to Michigan, according 
to the criminal information.

Schaap took the girl 'with the intent 
that she engage in sexual activity for which (Schaap could) be charged 
with a criminal offense', according to the Chicago Tribune.

Prosecutors are seeking to forfeit a 
number of items they believe he used when committing the crime, 
including his iPad, iPhone, digital camera, voice recorder and two 
computer flash drives.

Schaap had been counseling the teenage girl, one former member of First Baptist Trisha Kee told CBS Chicago.

The church did not confirm Ms Kee's statement, but issued a statement in August explaining why they fired him: ‘Our church grieves the need to take this action and the impact it will have on our people,' the statement read.

'We ask that everyone pray for the families involved, and pray that the situation will be handled in a Christ-honoring manner.’

The legal age of consent in the state of Indiana is 16, the lowest age allowed in any state.

Eddie Wilson, the director of public relations for the church, told the Chicago Sun-Times that the church is in the process of finding a new pastor to lead the congregation.

He added that Schaap and his wife Cindy are currently in seclusion to work out their marital difficulties. Cindy Schaap is the daughter of the late founder of the church, Rev Jack Hyles.

Schapp's published books include Marriage: The Divine Intimacy and Dating 
with a Purpose: Common Sense Dating Principles for Couples, Parents, and
Youth Workers.

The pastor has received his fair share of criticism over the years due to some of his more controversial teachings.

Last year, he was chastized for his views on women, believing them to be an inferior species and saying husbands should take charge of their wives and blasted Eve as being the sinner.

He also said it would be a 'cold day in hell before I get my theology from a woman', adding: 'Your soul is going to hell because of what Eve did.'

Long-running: Schaap, pictured preaching from the church's pulpit, had been pastor there since 2001, but was dismissed after a vote from the deacons

Place of worship: The First Baptist Church is located in Hammond, Indiana, and is partially housed in the old federal court building; its auditorium sits 7,500

Typically, mega-churches have more than 2,000 members or regular attendees, with several areas to listen to sermons, often with one or more pastors speaking during a Sunday service.

Mega-churches are houses of worship with 2,000 or more members and weekly attendees. They have grown in popularity in recent years, and are mostly a phenomenon of modern times.

According to the Hartford Institute for Religion Research, most current mega-churches were founded after 1955 after larger churches started to become more appealing to many church-goers. Many focus on ‘seeker services,’ which often offer little deep theology and instead appeal to sceptics and non-believers.

They are also aimed at targeting younger audiences, often with the prospects of contemporary music and more casual settings than traditional churches.

The denominations involved include Baptists, Methodists, and Nondenominational, as well as some Pentecostal churches.

Many of them feature contemporary worship styles, with live music complete with worship band, and sometimes even an orchestra pit.

Mega-churches have also received a fair amount of criticism, as some say they focus more on entertainment than on worship, and that large numbers detract the amount of time pastors can spend with the congregation.

First Baptist itself is housed in the old federal courthouse building in Hammond, Indiana, and contains an auditorium that seats 7,500.

Mr Wilson said that more than 15,000 people attend services at the weekend.

Members of the mega-church have already expressed their shock at the pastor’s alleged actions.

‘The pastor been good to us,’ said Ronald Winston to WGN-TV. Mr Winston lives at the church’s mission. ‘He take care of the shelter. I don’t have no better opinion of him.’

Another member, Aranda White, said: ‘To me, he was teaching to word from the Bible. I have nothing bad to say about him.’

An informational meeting was held at the church at 7pm tonight to address the dismissal of Schaap, who has led the congregation since 2001.

In the meeting of the congregation Wednesday night, church leaders said that Schaap admitted to having sex with one of the members of First Baptist Church when she was 16.

The Times of Northwest Indiana reported that near the end of the meeting, Pastor Eddie Lapina said that he would serve as interim pastor as the church continues their search for a suitable replacement.

Those filing out of the meeting bore grim faces, and few offered to comment for the paper.

Those who did said that they would continue to pray for the family and for Schaap. More than 1,000 people attended the meeting.

One member, Joseph Flores, said that he was feeling conflicted over the firing. ‘I’m glad to see they’re doing something,’ he told the Times, ‘but I hope they show the good he’s done for us, too. He straightened up this part of the city, and he’s done a lot for this community.’
