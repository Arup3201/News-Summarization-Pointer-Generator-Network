Mercedes motorsport boss Toto Wolff concedes he is under pressure to prevent the feud between Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg from boiling over, but is confident he can keep a lid on the situation.

The duelling drivers head into this weekend's Canadian Grand Prix in Montreal with Hamilton claiming he and Rosberg are 'still friends' in the wake of their recent fall-out in Monaco.

Discussions have taken place between them, with more planned prior to the events at the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve to ensure there is no repeat of the scenes witnessed at Monte-Carlo.

Hamilton was left fuming with Rosberg for what he suggested was a deliberate attempt to thwart his final qualifying lap, and so deny him pole position.

It proved crucial as Rosberg won from pole, with Hamilton runner-up, resulting in a frosty podium ceremony as neither man acknowledged the other.

Whilst non-executive chairman Niki Lauda claims the matter has been resolved, the three-times champion also suggested given the fight for the title between the two 'alpha' drivers, the situation would remain 'tricky' for the rest of the season.

As team boss, Wolff knows he is in the spotlight and concedes that 'clearly' he can feel the pressure mounting on his shoulders as the season progresses and incidents occur.

'It is a matter of managing the situation,'said Wolff, 'In our case we adopted the philosophy of letting them race, which as a consequence means management is a bit more difficult.

'But I try to be as transparent and as neutral as possible, to give guidance to a situation in a way that it is not detrimental to the team.

'That is because our team, Mercedes, comes first and we will never accept an individual putting themselves above the team.

'Both of them know that, accept it and have adopted that philosophy.'It is why, when asked whether he could keep a lid on the situation, Wolff replied: 'Yes. Absolutely.

'We are managing the team, they are part of the team, part of a very large organisation and I have 110 per cent confidence it will not be to the detriment of the team.

'Monaco was obviously a difficult one, but our sixth win in a row, so let's continue to let them race and hopefully we'll end the season without any incident.

'At the moment we have quite a bit of a margin we can allow ourselves and provide a little bit of entertainment to everybody.'

Resolved: Mercedes non-executive chairman Niki Lauda says there are no outstanding issues between Rosberg and Hamilton but that their rivalry would remain a tricky one throughout the season

What occurred in Monaco was heightened by the fact Lauda had revealed to an incident in the race beforehand in Spain that had been kept in-house.

That was with regard to Hamilton turning up the wick on his engine to qualifying mode to keep Rosberg at bay in the closing stages, going directly against the grain as to what had previously been discussed.

Despite Lauda letting the cat out of the bag, Wolff sees no reason to keep Lauda in check also.

'Niki has a very important role in the team,' insisted Wolff. 'He is a three-time world champion, somebody who has great access to Lewis because Lewis accepts Niki's history and Niki's achievements in F1.

'I think Niki probably felt a little bit let down by the emotions (of Hamilton in Spain), and this is why I don't think it was an unguided missile. It was to set the record straight.'
