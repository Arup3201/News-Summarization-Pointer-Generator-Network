The unnamed man, in his 30s, will have a tooth broken in his mouth in accordance with the Quran which states 'an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth'

A Saudi man who admitted knocking a tooth out of his mother's mouth after punching her has been told he will have the same tooth broken as punishment.

The unnamed man was also sentenced to five years in jail and 2,400 lashes to be given out at a rate of 40 every 10 days in a local marketplace.

The man, in his 30s, was arrested after his mother contacted the police asking them to rescue her after the attack.

While his mother was taken to hospital, police took the son before the courts, according to the Saudi paper Okaz.

The judge, Turki Al Qarni, issued the ruling after a medical report showed the son was mentally stable, and had not taken drugs or drunk alcohol.

The ruling is based on a verse from the Koran which reads: 'And We ordained therein for them: A life for a life, an eye for an eye, a nose for a nose, an ear for an ear, a tooth for a tooth'.

In Arabic countries it is typical for harsher sentences to be handed out for attacks against parents, as the Koran holds them in high regard.

According to Gulf News, last year, a judge in the Red Sea city of Jeddah sentenced a man who had beaten his mother and broken her arm to remain in jail until she agreed to let him out.

The man, who admitted during the investigation that he had physically abused his elderly mother, was also sentenced to 200 lashes for his assault.

Even when parents are not involved, courts in the Middle east are known to hand out brutal punishments in accordance with the Koran.

THe man was also sentenced to five years in prison and 2,400 lashes, which is a common punishment handed out in Saudi Arabia (file picture)

In December last year a Yemeni man was sentenced to 20 lashes after claiming his new wife was not a virgin in front of her father.

Rather than be dishonored the girl submitted to an examination to prove her virginity, and then took her husband to court.

Saudi Arabia has faced strong international condemnation over its use of corporal and capital punishment.

Public beatings and executions are common place in the autocratic Kingdom.

In December a political activist was sentenced to 300 lashes and four years in prison for calling for a constitutional monarchy in the country.
