Most of us remember My Little Pony as a candy-colored horse with a comb to brush its mane, but the modern incarnation is closer to a Barbie than a pony.

With each new generation, the plastic toys seem to have longer and skinnier legs, bigger eyes and more human-like traits.

In the latest version, as seen in an upcoming straight-to-DVD movie, the ponies morph fully into Equestria Girls - teenage girl versions of the animals in high school.

The Equestria Girls sport the ponies' signature rainbow-colored manes, and they even have matching tails.

But in their human form, they also all have tiny waists and Barbie-like proportions, with somewhat risque outfits that feature miniskirts, tight tops and knee-high boots.

Some have criticized Hasbro, the 
company that produces My Little Pony, for taking the toys' 
transformation to this extreme, morphing them into characters that 
resemble Bratz.

One commenter wrote on Twitter: 'My Little Pony is becoming human! Beyond creepy.'

Another concerned fan of the classic 
toys wrote: 'In the My Little Pony movie they turn into people - what 
are you doing? I don't want my little human, I might as well watch 16 
and pregnant.'

And Karen Lau, a mom from New York City, told the New York Daily News that the modern takes on My Little Pony are too hot to trot.

'They look like the Spice Girls,' she said. 'They're a little too sexy. It's an image I don't want my daughters to grow up with.'

But John A Frascotti, the chief marketing 
officer at Hasbro, has defended the make-over, explaining that humanizing the animals 
was a necessary move from a business perspective.

'They look like Spice Girls, a little too sexy - not an image I want my daughters to grow up with'

'We
 are responding to the desire by our fans to experience the brand in 
more ways,' he told the New York Times.

'They imagined themselves as which pony they would 
be or which pony they identified with the most.'

The new movie will follow Twilight Sparkle, a princess pony, who travels to the human world through a magical mirror.

At a human-inhabited high school, Twilight Sparkle runs for Fall Formal Princess - essentially a form of Prom Queen - so she can win back the magical crown that rightfully belongs to her.

This isn't the first time the ponies have undergone a dramatic transformation.

The first generation of My Little Pony was the most similar to a real horse, with haunches, hooves and a mane - albeit a baby pink one.

In 1989, the ponies were given more human-like smiles, as well as longer legs and hair.

TV series Friendship Is Magic debuted in 2010. This saw the animals with longer legs, skinnier builds and big, anime-style eyes.

Equestria Girls will be released on DVD on August 24, and will be broadcast on the Hub Network on September 1.
