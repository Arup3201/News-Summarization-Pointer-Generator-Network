Police forces are stuck in a time warp, using out-of-date methods to deal with modern offences in substandard investigations, a report claimed yesterday.

Inspectors found that only one in four crimes are being solved by police.

A watchdog also said victims are routinely let down, as nearly half of the country’s police aren’t good enough at investigating crime.

Yesterday Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) published a 243-page audit giving forces an Ofsted-style rating for the very first time.

They were ranked as outstanding, good, requires improvement or inadequate in key performance areas including preventing and investigating crime, providing value for money and operating fairly.

Detectives are failing to carry out house-to-house inquiries, take photos of injuries in domestic abuse cases and collect CCTV evidence on violent attacks, today's report revealed

The assessment revealed that police are failing to get to grips with cyber crime, child sexual exploitation and crimes against the vulnerable and elderly.

Inspectors were also concerned about the ‘erosion’ of officers’ basic investigative skills in relation to crimes such as burglary and assault.

A total of 18 out of 43 forces in England and Wales serving 28million people – nearly half of the UK’s population – need to improve their investigations, the report claimed. These include some of our biggest forces, with officers in London, Manchester, Leeds and Sheffield said to lack vital skills and experience.

In the 18 underperforming forces, detectives sometimes failed to properly gather evidence from CCTV footage, take fingerprints, identify suspects and support victims.

There were also problems exposed in the way forces deal with domestic abuse and violent crimes, with detectives not carrying out basic house-to-house inquiries or taking photographs of injuries. In other cases, investigation plans had been ‘cut and pasted’ from previous jobs.

The shocking findings come just a week after the HMIC criticised forces for ‘indefensible’ failures in crime recording which see almost a million offences a year disappearing from official figures.

Tom Winsor, the chief inspector, said ‘sluggish’ police had fallen ‘behind the curve of rapidly changing criminality’ because they were not recruiting the right people.

He added: ‘The police in too many respects are policing many crimes of today with the methods of yesterday.

‘In the past the police recruited 18-year-old men to deal with burglaries and with street violence.

‘The kind of police officer needed today is much more tech-savvy and more sympathetic, with a wider range of skills – and yet today we are seeing the police predominantly policing yesterday’s crimes with yesterday’s methods and kit.’

Mr Winsor said top officers should take the blame for their forces being ‘insufficiently prepared for the crimes of the future’.

And the report went on to warn that as a result of cuts, officer numbers will fall to their lowest for a decade, predicting: ‘The already thin blue line in our communities is narrowing still further.’

Steve White, chairman of the Police Federation of England and Wales, said: ‘We have been warning there are issues around what the service can provide against cuts to funding and police numbers.

‘Although we are pleased that the majority of forces are performing well, we know that officers are struggling to provide the service they believe the public deserve.’
