The bodies of a young couple who went missing just before New Year’s Eve have been found in the garage of the woman’s New Jersey home.

Jorge Rodriguez, 24, and his girlfriend Melissa Pereira, 25, were last seen leaving her home in Wayne on Dec. 27, supposedly headed for a Pennsylvania bed and breakfast - but they never showed up.

Their bodies were found on Sunday morning inside Rodriguez’s car some three weeks after they had been reported missing.

Investigators are awaiting the results of an autopsy to determine the cause and manner of death, said Passaic County Assistant Prosecutor Michael DeMarco.

It was not immediately known how long the bodies were in the garage and no notes were found, a source told the Cliffview Pilot.

The couple had New Years’ Eve reservations at the Cherry Valley Manor, a bed-and-breakfast in the Poconos, but Pereira didn’t take her wallet and Rodriguez didn’t call work when he didn’t show on Dec 28.

Since their disappearance, Pereira's cell phone had been in use, but would quickly get turned off.

The couple had been dating for about two years and were said to be very happy and excited for the future

The couple were registered in the national missing person's database on Jan. 13.

Earlier this month, Garfield Police 
Captain Darren Sucorowski said there was no reason to believe Rodriguez 
and Pereira were victims of a crime.

An uncle of Pereira told the Star-Ledger that the family was ‘just in shock’ at the news.

‘At this point we're just still in shock and we're just trying to wait for what the medical examiners are going to say,’ he said.

Angie Escobar, Rodriguez’s cousin, told North Jersey.com that she ‘found it kind of bizarre’ that the couple was found in Rodriguez’s car in Pereira’s garage.

So in love: Family and friends say there is no reason the couple may have wanted to take their own lives. They were looking forward to their anniversary and had a bright future together

‘It’s just so sad,’ Escobar said. ‘He was so young. He had so much to give.’

The couple had been dating for about two years, Escobar said, and they were very happy and excited for the future.

Twitter profiles show a couple in love. On Dec. 27, Pereira tweeted 'weekend with my everything :) #lovehim.'

On Oct. 14, Rodriguez sent out a note saying “I love my princess” with Pereira’s handle and a smiley face. On Dec. 4, he re-tweeted Pereira’s message that said 'adore you.'

Perriera’s last job was as a production assistant for FOX News, while Rodriguez had worked as a manager in a photography studio.
