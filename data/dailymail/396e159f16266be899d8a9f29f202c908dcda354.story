Most of us would never be able to summon up the courage to walk on the outside of a plane 1,000ft in the air - but for one graduate, all it took was an advert in the local paper.

Nikita Salmon recently became the latest member of the Breitling Wingwalkers team, and now travels the country performing daredevil feats.

Although her chosen career would be considered utterly terrifying by most people, the 21-year-old is adamant that it is the most excited job imaginable.

Terrifying: But the graduate insists hers is the most exciting job in the world

Miss Salmon took up wingwalking soon after she graduated from Cardiff University.

She first heard about the Breitling squad when she saw they were advertising for new members in her local newspaper.

Her first performance came in front of thousands of spectators at the Royal International Air Tattoo at Fairford, Gloucestershire.

She was strapped to the wings of a bi-plane dating back to the 1940s, and performed a co-ordinated routine with her colleagues while flying through the air at 100mph.

Miss Salmon, who is from Northleach in Gloucestershire and studied psychology and sociology at university, has nothing but praise for her calling.

'The thrill of wingwalking provides a sensation which very few are lucky enough to have experienced,' she said.

Choreography: The team's amazing stunts involve tricky co-ordination between all its members

'There really is nothing that compares with the speed and exhilaration of diving in the sky and pulling into a loop.

'I feel so lucky to be able to experience it.'

Breitling Wingwalkers, based at Rendcomb Airfield near Cirencester, is the world's only formation wingwalking display team.
