Swedish photographer Clara Hallencreutz likes to have fun with her food and her latest project is pretty sweet.

Fusing food with fashion the still life lenswoman has created a collection of colourful images featuring the Chanel logo in various unusual guises as part of her Taste Chanel set.

She describes herself as an artist creating contemporary photography art with a mix between pop and surrealism.

And there's definitely something surreal about seeing the luxury Chanel brand printed on fast food cartons and calorie-laden ice creams.

Her new Taste Chanel exhibition features pictures depicting the famous double 'C' logo created out of piles of rainbow candy and cup cakes

Also in the Taste Chanel exhibit are 
pictures depicting the famous double 'C' logo created out of piles of 
rainbow candy and cup cakes.

There is also a branded champagne glass, which might be more to Chanel head honcho Karl Lagerfeld's particular tastes.

The 70-year-old designer, who slimmed down following an extreme diet in 2001, now follows a very strict food plan and is famous for his acerbic put-downs and dislike of anybody that doesn't adhere to his body ideals.

Last year the controversial German fashionista slammed British singer Adele, saying: 'The thing at the moment is Adele," he told Metro. 'She is a little too fat, but she has a beautiful face and a divine voice.'

Previous collections by the 20something artist include Smell Chanel, limited edition prints of the fashion house's logo created out of flowers

Hallencreutz is currently exhibiting in London and she has also shown in Australia, Peking, Jinan and her hometown of Stockholm after completing a Photography degree in Brisbane, Australia

Hallencreutz is currently
exhibiting in London and she has also shown in Australia, 
Peking, Jinan and her hometown of Stockholm after completing a 
Photography degree in Brisbane, Australia.

Initially
Hallencreutz specialised in commercial photography. Today the tone of 
her artwork is, she says: 'amusing and carefree, featuring 
bold dynamic colours isolated in a clean surrounding'.

The stunning blonde, in her mid-twenties, spends a lot of time in front of the lens as well as behind it and her glamorous Instagram account has over 30,000 followers.

Hallencreutz's pieces come in three sizes and are encased in 1.5cm plexi-glass. Prices start at around £4,000 with every piece by the photographer being limited edition or a one-off.

Currently one piece at a time is on show at the Opera Gallery in London's Bond Street, being changed once sold.

The Taste Chanel collection also features a branded champagne glass and a swirl of frosted cupcakes that would definitely be OFF the menu in Paris HQ
