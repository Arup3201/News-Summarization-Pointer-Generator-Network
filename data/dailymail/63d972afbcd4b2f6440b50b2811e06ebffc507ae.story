Having a name starting with the letters A to M is just as important as the picture you choose for an online dating profile, a study has shown 

Forget your chat-up lines and ditch the expensive aftershave, because scientists say the secret to dating is far simpler.

The key to finding love is all in a name, it seems.

A team of researchers has discovered that people with names earlier in the alphabet are more likely to be romantically successful.

After carrying out an extensive search of studies in the fields of psychology and sociology, as well as computer, behavioural, and neurocognitive sciences, the scientists from Queen Mary University of London found that names are vital for first impressions.

Their study, published in the Evidence Based Medicine journal, suggests that having a name starting with the letters A to M is just as important as the picture you choose for an online dating profile.

Professor Khalid Khan, who led the research, said: 'Alphabetically ordering things has been around for centuries.

'Research has shown that this accident of initial letters has important influence on outcomes.

'A always comes first. Peoples are drawn to those at the top of any listing.

'Applied to online dating this means that those at the top of the listing get first bite of the attention from potential love-interests and so have a higher chance of being matched.'

'There is something in human nature that draws us to those at the top of any listing and this phenomenon, though not fully explained, has an impact on online dating. Perhaps we subconsciously give higher value to things that appear to be at the top of the pile.'

He added: 'Research shows that people with names in top half alphabet paper to do better in education compared to those in lower half, on average. Amazon and Apple, successful companies begin with A.

'This does not mean that things lower down in the alphabet don't have a chance - Zara is a successful company too - it is just that on average their chances are lower.'

The researchers said that the 'screen names' that people choose for an online dating profile are vital.

Names with negative associations like 'Little' or 'Bug' should be avoided.

They also said that group photos showing other people having a good time in their company, preferably with them right in the middle and touching someone else - but only on the upper arm - will help to convey friendliness, importance and status.

A flattering photograph remains important in securing a date – particularly one that features a genuine smile that crinkles up the eyes and possibly a tilt of the head.

Women seeking men should wear red as this is likely to boost the level of interest, the study suggests.

Females also find a man more attractive when they see other women smiling at him, they concluded.
