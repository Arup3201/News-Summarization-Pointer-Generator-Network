Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has accused Tehran of carrying out the bomb attack which killed six Israeli tourists at a Bulgarian airport earlier today and promised in a statement today that there would be an Israeli response.

The bomb exploded outside the airport at the Black Sea resort of Burgas  on a double-decker 
bus which was filled with tourists who had just 
arrived on a charter flight from Israel.

Witnesses told Israeli media that the blast, which injured at least 30 people, occurred soon after someone boarded the vehicle.

‘All the signs lead to Iran. Only in 
the past few months we have seen Iranian attempts to attack Israelis in 
Thailand, India, Georgia, Kenya, Cyprus and other places,’ Netanyahu 
said in a statement.

The explosion coincided with the 18th anniversary of an Iranian suicide bomb which killed 85 people at a Jewish organisation in Argentina.

‘We heard a very strong blast. The bus
was full with people and children. Flesh and blood everywhere,' a 
Bulgarian witness told local television.

‘I saw another bus catching fire
from the one that exploded. It was complete chaos.’

According to 
witnesses the bus was destroyed in the blast and body parts were strewn 
on the tarmac outside the airport as clouds of dense black smoke 
billowed above it.

Aviva Malka who was on board the bus 
when the bomb exploded said: ‘We sat down and within a few seconds we 
heard a huge boom and we ran away.

'We managed to escape through a hole 
on the bus.’

The Interior Ministry declined to 
comment on whether it might have been a suicide attack, as some 
witnesses had speculated, and said it was questioning people who had 
been close to the blast to get a clearer idea of what happened.

The blast comes on the 18th 
anniversary of a 1994 bomb attack on the headquarters of Argentina's 
main Jewish organisation by an Iranian-backed Hezbollah suicide bomber, 
which killed 85 people.

In his statement Benjamin Netanyahu 
said: ‘Eighteen years exactly after the blast at the Jewish community 
centre in Argentina, murderous Iranian terror continues to hit innocent 
people.

'This is an Iranian terror attack that is spreading throughout 
the entire world. Israel will react powerfully against Iranian terror.’

Aftermath: Destroyed buses are seen at the airport. Police have not confirmed the identity of the victims

Israeli officials had previously said 
that Bulgaria, a popular holiday destination for Israeli tourists, was 
vulnerable to attack by Islamist militants who could infiltrate via 
nearby Turkey.

The incident was not reported by Iranian media and there was no immediate Iranian reaction to the Israeli accusation.

Israeli diplomats have been targeted in several countries in recent months by bombers who Israel said struck on behalf of Iran.

Although Tehran has denied 
involvement, some analysts believe it is trying to avenge the 
assassinations of several scientists from its controversial nuclear 
programme, which the Iranians have blamed on Israel and its Western 
allies.

The mayor of Burgas on Bulgaria's Black Sea coast, said the bus was carrying Israeli tourists, but the police could not immediately confirm the nationality of the dead

Israel has threatened air strikes 
against Iran's nuclear facilities if diplomatic efforts fail to rein in 
its programme.

Israel and Western powers accuse Iran of working towards a
nuclear bomb, but Tehran says its research is strictly for peaceful 
ends.

Bulgaria's interior ministry 
spokeswoman Vanya Vulkova told Sky News there was an explosion on a 
passenger bus at Burgas Airport on Wednesday.

'I can only confirm that there was an explosion at Burgas Airport,' she was quoted as saying.

Burgas Airport was closed following the explosion and flights were being redirected to Varna Airport.

Several other buses at the airport were damaged in the explosion.

British Foreign Minister William Hague said: 'I condemn today's terrorist attack.

'The full tragedy of the attacks is 
not yet clear, but I would like to express my condolences to the friends
and family of those injured and killed.'
