Sheffield Wednesday boss Stuart Gray insists there is no fear in the camp as the Owls prepare to return to the scene of their worst defeat of the season in the FA Cup third round.

Manchester City were Wednesday's opponents at the same stage of the Capital One Cup in September and romped to a 7-0 win despite failing to break the deadlock in a tight first half.

'It was an even game for 45 minutes and I thought we performed very well,' Gray told the club's website, www.swfc.co.uk.

The Owls have won four of their last six games to give them confidence ahead of the trip to Manchester

'But Manchester City showed their qualities as one of the best teams in the world after the break and we all know what happened.'

Gray's men were sixth in the Sky Bet Championship at the time having lost only one of their first eight games, but saw their season come off the rails in the wake of the humbling loss.

Wednesday have recovered from a run of 10 league games without victory to win four of their last six to kick-start their season ahead of another trip to the Etihad Stadium on Sunday.

Gray added: 'We know what they are capable of; we know what they can do to teams. What we have to do is go there with no fear and remember how we did well in the first half.

'There is no fear of the unknown this time; we know the stadium, the pitch, and we want to give our supporters something to cheer.

'I am excited about this game and so are the players. If you can't get excited about a game like this, you can't get excited about anything.'

Wednesday can take confidence from the way Championship rivals Watford and Wigan performed against City at the Etihad last season. Unlike Wigan, Watford were unable to hang on to their lead and exited the competition.

Few Hornets fans will be expecting a cup run this term after the draw handed the club a trip to Premier League leaders Chelsea, but defender Tommie Hoban is confident of causing an upset.

'Look at the game against Man City, I think we were the first team to score at the Etihad in a good while,' he told Hornets Player.

'Some of the players we've got going forward, particularly the likes of (Fernando) Forestieri, (Matej) Vydra and (Odion) Ighalo, with their tricks and skills, on their day they can score against anyone or create something out of nothing.

'We've got to go there and believe, and with that belief anything can happen.'

In three other ties which pit Football League clubs against sides from the top flight on Sunday, last year's semi-finalists Sheffield United go to QPR, Ipswich visit Southampton and Blackpool travel to Aston Villa.
