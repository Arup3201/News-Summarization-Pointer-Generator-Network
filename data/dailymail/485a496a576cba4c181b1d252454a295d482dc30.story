A woman was so badly beaten while out hiking that her husband couldn't recognise her.

Tina Waddell, 42, was walking the Silver Comet Trail in Paulding, Georgia, on Tuesday when she subjected to a brutal and unprovoked attack.

She was ambushed on a bridge over Academy Drive near the Chamber of Commerce Trail Head, having covered nearly 20 miles of the walk.

Mrs Waddell moved from Arkansas to Georgia and used the Silver Comet Trail every day. 

Yesterday the local police still had no leads on either a suspect or motive for the senseless attack, reported Fox Carolina.

Mrs Waddell is due to undergo the first of several reconstructive surgeries today as her husband, Jim, said: 'When I first saw her … the emotions came out because that's not my wife.

'They warned me before I saw her that there was a lot of swelling, and when I went in there, I just broke down. I've cried the last two days. I don't think I have any tears left inside of me.

'She has a lot of broken bones in her face. Her nose is broke. They're going to have to wire her jaw shut, and that's going to be six to eight weeks.'

Mrs Waddell was alone at the 19½ mile marker when her attacker jumped out.

'She just said she was running and she said that he came at her from the front and that was all she remembered,' said Mr Waddell.

According to police reports, during the attack Mrs Waddell slipped in and out of consciousness.

After the assault the attacker dragged Mrs Waddell into the woods where he left her. As Mrs Waddell regained consciousness she managed to drag herself on to the trail where she was seen by Peter Skott who immediately rang 911.

Of seeing Mrs Waddell, he said: 'I'm not going to forget that image for a long time.'

'Thank God for a great man who happened to call 911 when he found her,' said Mr Waddell.

Shortly after being taken to hospital, Mrs Waddell gave the police a vague description of her assailant but since has blocked it all from her mind, according to her husband, and now remembers nothing of the attack.

'I don't know. Could he'd been on drugs? Was [sex] that he wanted and just didn't get it?' asked Mr Waddell. The police do not believe that Mrs Waddell was sexually assaulted.

'Tina fought for her life. This guy's got injuries, somebody out there has to know something,' said Joe Waddell, the victim's brother-in-law. 'I'm a fireman and I've seen a lot of things, but I was not prepared to see when I walked in that hospital room.'

The family says that Tina Waddell has been moved from an intensive care unit to a regular room in Kennestone Hospital (above)

They have set up an appeal to pay for Mrs Waddell's medical bills and as a reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the attacker.
