A massive security operation involving 1,000 police officers has been launched in Indianapolis as the city's first Super Bowl rolls into town this week.

Super Bowl fever has already hit the city and 150,000 NFL fans are expected to descend on downtown Indianapolis in one of the most high-security events in the U.S.

The city has invested millions of dollars to keep spectators safe, including most bizarrely the installation of 150 new manhole covers after a series of underground explosions.

Officers at the event have been equipped with smartphones and other electronic hand-held devices to allow them to feed photos and videos to a new state-of-the-art operations centre on the city's east side.

Police cruisers will be driven around a 44-block area in the heart of the city as backup, and officers from the FBI will also be scanning the crowd for signs of pickpocketing, prostitution or other trouble.

The Super Bowl venue, Lucas Oil Stadium, will even be swept for nuclear threats as authorities leave nothing to chance.

Public Safety Director Frank Straub said: 'This is clearly bigger in terms of the amount of people who will be downtown over an extended period of time.'

Indianapolis is used to hosting large sporting events - the Indianapolis 500 attracts more than 200,000 fans every year and the NCAA's men's Final Four basketball tournament has been held there six times since 1980.

But its first Super Bowl poses some unique challenges.

Under a security risk rating system used by the federal government, the Super Bowl ranks second just below national security events involving the president and the Secret Service, according to Indianapolis Chief of Homeland Security Gary Coons.

The ratings are based on factors including international attention, media coverage, number of people the event attracts and visits by celebrities and foreign dignitaries.

In comparison, the Indianapolis 500 ranks two levels below the Super Bowl.

A series of explosions in Indianapolis Power & Light's (IPL) underground network of utility cables has caused concern over the safety of fans - with a dozen blasts since 2005 sending manhole covers hurtling through the air.

The IPL has spent $180,000 installing new locking manhole covers in the Super Bowl village. The covers lift a couple of inches off the ground if an explosion takes place - enough to vent gas without feeding oxygen to magnify the blast.

Special teams from the Department of Energy will sweep the stadium - normally home to the Indianapolis Colts - for nuclear terror threats and the new $18million communications centre has been opened in time for the lead-up to the big game.

Mr Straub added: 'We're using more technology, and state-of-the-art technology, than has been used in any Super Bowl before this one.'

Super Bowl XLVI pitches the New England Patriots against the New York Giants, in a replay of the 2008 game in Glendale, Arizona.

Both teams have won the Vince Lombardi trophy three times, but the Giants beat the Patriots in XLII 17-14.

Patriots' quarterback Tom Brady was 
given a raucous sendoff in Foxborough yesterday as he gave a confident 
interview to 25,000 fans.

He
said: 'We're going down there for one reason. We're going to give it 
our best and hopefully we'll have a lot more people at our party next 
weekend.'

It is the Patriots' fifth Super Bowl in the last 11 years and their first since the Giants scored their shock win.

But team were more subdued after arriving in Indianapolis.

Wide
receiver Wes Welker told the New York Daily News: 'We're just planning 
on this game. Putting a game plan together and getting ourselves ready 
to play is object No. 1'

Last
year, the Super Bowl became the most watched American television 
programme in history, with an average audience of 111million viewers.
