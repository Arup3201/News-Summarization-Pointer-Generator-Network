Campaigners protesting about six blocks of student flats which are a 'horrible eyesore' on a city skyline are urging authorities to slice off the top floors of the buildings at an estimated cost of £30million.

Protesters, including author Mark Haddon, have described the Castle Mill development near Port Meadow, Oxford, as a 'terrible mistake' and claim it blocks the view of the city's famous spires.

The flats, which are used as graduate housing by the University of Oxford, have been marred by controversy since development began in 2012.

After being built by Frankham Consultancy Group on behalf of the University, at a cost of £24million, the Save Port Meadow group was set up to protest against their existence.

Over the last two years, it has campaigned against the development, claiming there were 'exceptionally low levels' of public awareness of the initial planning application and criticising it for 'hampering' the city's skyline from the ancient meadow.

The Castle Mill development has not only received criticism for its location, but also for its design.

Former Planning Minister Nick Boles MP previously described the buildings as 'some of the worst he had seen'.

Speaking in January last year, he said: 'I think that this design is possibly one of the worst designs I've seen of any set of new buildings to go up in the last 10 years.

'Frankly, the only thing it reminds me of is the Maze Prison.'

The development was also nominated for the Carbuncle Cup in 2013 , which is an annual award by Building Design for 'the ugliest building in the United Kingdom completed in the last 12 months.'

In its nomination, the development was described as 'a deeply unimaginative and impoverished design which would lower the spirits whatever its setting, but on the edge of one of central England's most important and ancient landscapes, it is an outrage.'

The saga surrounding the Castle Mill development began in late 2011 when the University of Oxford submitted the planning application to Oxford City Council.

As part of a consultation document for the development - which was built on a brownfield site near Oxford railway station - planning consultants stated that it would 'not be visible from the majority of Port Meadow'.

Over the last two years, the Save Port Meadow campaign group has protested against the development, criticising the University for building on the ancient meadow. Pictured: The meadow before the development

At the time, city council planning officers stated that the development was not in an environmentally-sensitive location and therefore no Environmental Impact Statement (EIA) was required.

Development began in summer 2012, and building work soon drew attention from residents and local business owners who were surprised at the height of the flat blocks. An online petition was drawn up to protest the height of the buildings and quickly gathered thousands of signatures.

In March the following year, the Council for the Protection of England (CPRE) issued a High Court challenge, challenging the council's decision not to request an Environmental Impact Statement as part of the planning process.

It prompted the University to announce it would commission independent planning consultants to carry out a retrospective Environmental Impact Statement.

The assessment was published towards the end of last year with three options: To change the appearance of the building externally, carry out height reduction on a couple of the buildings or reduce the height of all the buildings to the treeline of Port Meadow.

The University has now confirmed that the institution's 'Congregation' - its sovereign body, which consists of academic staff - will now vote on a formal motion to reduce the height of the blocks.

The motion will be discussed on February 10, and could be followed by a postal vote.

Protesters against the development include author and Oxford graduate Mark Haddon, who wrote The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time

He told MailOnline: 'Normally in planning cases, you have up to three months after a planning application to lodge an appeal but in this case nobody really knew the application had been planted.

'Nobody was aware of the buildings until they started going up in September 2012, by which time the three-month period for a legal challenge to the planning permission had long passed.

'This was one of the many unusual things about the case so we started looking into it and what we uncovered was an extremely unsatisfactory planning process.

'The costs of rectifying the building are very high. The University should have acted much earlier, when it realised a terrible mistake had been made and when it became obvious that almost everyone complained about the buildings - not just because of the impact but that they had no idea planning permission had been applied for.'

Mr Porter admitted that it would cause upheaval to students living in the building if work was carried out to reduce the height, but said this should have been thought about at the beginning of the planning process.

He said: 'I don't think the University is facing any easy options but what price do you put on its accountability to get things sorted.

'I recognise that there are no easy choices now. The idea of spending the money on buildings that have already gone up is crazy and I can fully understand the view that there are other things the University could spend the money on.

'But the trouble is that it all comes down to the fact that thousands of people have had their experiences of a natural heritage site ruined for the 40-year lifetime of these buildings without them ever having had a say in it.

'Through their own incompetence the University managed to achieve this extraordinary outcome, this messy development that has had a huge impact.

'I don't think it was deliberate, I think it was incompetence.

'The people making this decision on February 10 now have a proper moral decision.

'They messed up royally and managed to have this extraordinary situation, and if they vote not to do it, then the public are the ones who suffer. '

Mr Haddon, the author of The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time and a graduate of Oxford University's Merton College, agreed that a top floor of each of the buildings should be removed.

He told The Sunday Times: 'The Castle Mill development is a horrible eyesore. We all understand the need for more housing, but the development was an abuse of the planning process.

'I support the campaign to remove a floor.'

The decision on whether the buildings will be reduced in height will be discussed on February 10

The University said in a statement that its focus throughout the development has been the best interests of its students and the city.

A spokesman told MailOnline: 'We followed due planning process and built much-needed accommodation on a brownfield site on a former railway siding. 

'Castle Mill has now been occupied for nearly a-year-and-a-half, home to more than 300 graduate students, some with young families. 

'At the same time we have relieved pressure on Britain's most un-affordable housing market. 

'Independent experts have reported that Castle Mill, with the mitigation measures we propose, delivers clear benefits to the city.

'The resolution before Congregation would undo these benefits. All 300 students would have to leave for at least a year and 38 flats, including family units, would be lost permanently. 

'There would be knock-on damage to the city's hard-pressed property market. 

'The total cost of going down this route, according to independent experts, is £30million - more than the flats cost to build (£24million). 

'The proposal is strongly opposed by the Student Union precisely because of the harm it would do.' 

Oxford City Council confirmed it had commissioned and published an independent report by planning expert, Vincent Goodstadt, on the planning and environmental issues surrounding the development. 

A council spokesman told MailOnline: 'The Goodstadt Review concluded that the planning permission was valid and that the necessary information was provided to the planning committee in taking its decision. 

'The report included a recommended action plan which has been accepted and implemented in full by the council.'

The council spokesman also confirmed that the authority met the statutory requirements for consultation and said the University did undertake public consultation.

However, he added: 'The council has accepted that there could have been greater consultation and has changed some of its procedural arrangements in line with the Goodstadt Review recommendations on best practice.'

He concluded that the council 'has not yet taken a view on the adequacy of the latest proposals.'

The University's Congregation will now meet to formally discuss the height reduction motion on February 10.
