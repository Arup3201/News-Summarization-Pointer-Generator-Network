A Brisbane teenager with Down's syndrome has woken up to 15,000 cards from strangers on her 18th birthday.

Hannah Sullivan found her living room covered in birthday cards and presents on Friday morning after her dad Bruce put a call out on Facebook asking people to wish her a happy 18th birthday.

Family and friends gathered at the Sandgate home, north of Brisbane, to celebrate with the overwhelmed 18-year-old who joked she would need a year to get through all the cards.

Hannah Sullivan received 15,000 birthday cards when she turned 18 on Friday after her dad Bruce asked people on Facebook to send their wishes 

Mr Sullivan initially thought Hannah would receive about 100 birthday cards when he posted the message on Facebook last month.

But the message quickly went viral and the letters started arriving by the truck load.  

The family were forced to hide the buckets of cards in the garage to avoid Hannah finding them before her birthday on September 19.

Hannah was blind folded when she woke up on Friday and led downstairs by her dad where Today show television cameras were waiting to capture her reaction.

'We’re so proud of Hannah. You’re such a courageous, beautiful young lady who has had a go at everything and now you can have a go at opening 13,000 letters,' Mr Sullivan told his daughter.

'It's very sweet dad,' Hannah said as she hugged her father.

She was presented with a gift from favourite band One Direction and was delighted to find the Wiggles recorded her a personalised birthday message. 

Her family and friends cheered as Hannah blew out the candles on her on her three-tiered One Direction themed cake.

'It has just been an outpouring of generosity,' Mr Sullivan said. 

'It’s still a little crazy and amazing.'

Mr Sullivan told Nine News Hannah was completely in the dark when it came to the surprise. 

'That’s the beautiful thing about Hannah – she’s so present and in the moment,' he said. 

'She’s busy at school dancing, she’s got movies to watch... She’s a busy kid.'

The humble Hannah quietly told her father the whole ordeal was 'very sweet'

Hannah's family hoped that the widespread support for their daughter would encourage people to include those with a disability. 

'Hannah personally has not been invited to a birthday party other than immediate family since she was in Grade 4,' Mr Sullivan said. 

'She’s not intentionally excluded she’s just rarely included.

'(People with a disability) are less likely to initiate a relationship with someone.

'All it takes is a phone call or a letter.'
