A man who was trapped inside his body for years following a mystery childhood illness has revealed how he overcame unimaginable hurdles to become independent again - and find love.

Martin Pistorius, who grew up in South Africa and now lives in England, was just 12 when he slipped into an inexplicable comatose state and spent the next dozen years trapped inside his body.

Speaking to the Today show in his first U.S. television interview, he showed how far he has come since doctors realized he was aware of his surroundings  - including completing a degree, learning how to drive and getting married.

'I thought, "I have so much love inside of me and nobody to give it to",' the 39-year-old recalled, using a computer to speak.

Miraculous: Martin Pistorius, pictured during an interview with the Today show, slipped into an inexplicable coma when he was 12 and remained trapped inside his body for years before people realized he was aware

Happy together: In 2008, he met his sister's friend Joanna, left, and said it was love at first sight

But on New Year's Day 2008, he met his sister's friend Joanna and knew she was The One.

'It is hard to explain but you just know,' he said. 'I had heard people say that and always thought "yeah right" until it happened to me.'

Joanna, who sat beside him during the interview, said she felt it too. 

'[He] had such a nice smile and I just thought he's really attractive,' she said. 'He seemed like such a kind person.'

The couple, who married in 2009, are now hoping to start a family. Pistorius is able to have biological children, his wife said.

It is a life that, 20 years ago, his family never could have imagined he would have.

One day in January 1988, when he was 12, he was sent home early from school with a sore throat and his condition quickly deteriorated.

His mobility was the first to go, followed by his memory, and he was left completely unresponsive. His muscles wasted away and his hands and feet curled in on themselves.

Bizarre: Doctors were unable to explain why he had fallen ill. He was left unable to communicate or move

Doctors were never able to conclusively pinpoint the exact cause, but cryptococcal meningitis was the most likely culprit.

'We were told to take him home and take care of him until he died,' his father told the Today show.

But a couple of years later, Pistorius started becoming aware of his surroundings again even though he could not tell his family. He said he would attempt to move but it would go unnoticed.

'For so many years, I was like a ghost,' he told the Today show from his Essex home. 'I could hear and see everything, but it was like I wasn't there. I was invisible.'

Every day, his father would take him to a care center for eight hours, return at the end of the day and then take him home to be bathed and put to bed. He said the powerlessness was terrifying.

'Every single aspect of your life is controlled and determined by someone else,' he said. 'They decided where you are, what you eat, whether you sit or lie down, in what position you lie in, everything.'

For days on end when he was  17 and 18, he would be put in front of the children's television show 'Barney & Friends', and he says the thought of the purple dinosaur is still painful for him. 

Overwhelmed: Pistorius' parents, Rodney and Joan, were unaware that their son started to understand them when he was about 16. At one point, Joan told him that she hoped he would die

Struggle: When he was 26, a nurse realized that he seemed to understand her and told his parents to get him tested. It emerged that he did understand and slowly he re-learned how to read and communicate again

'Barney played, I guess you could say, a tormenting role in my life,' he said. 'For years, I would get flashbacks and have nightmares.' 

Instead, he tried to pass the time by looking at how the seasons changed, how the light moved across his room or how plants grew. His inner life kept him busy, he said.

'I used to live in my mind,' he said. 'I've had conversations with myself and other people all in my head. I'd imagine I was doing all sorts of things.'

His condition also caused pain for his family.

One night, his mother told him that she hoped he died. She did not know that he could hear it.

Pistorius said he isn't angry at his mother for what she said.

'I felt only love and compassion for my mother,' he said. 'My mother often felt that she wasn't a good mom and couldn't take care of me. One of the hardest things for me was I couldn't tell her that, 'No, you are doing great'.'

Eventually, in 2001, a new worker at his care center started sitting with him every day, and noticed that he was giving her small signals that suggested he was aware of his surroundings.

At age 26, Martin passed a test by identifying pictures of various items with his eyes. 

Love of his life: In 2008, he met Joanna, pictured, and she said she was immediately drawn to his smile

By his side: The couple married in 2009 and live in England, where they hope to start a family soon

Fighter: The couple chat with NBC reporter Kate Snow at their Essex home. Pistorius uses a computer, pictured, to help him speak. He said it came with an American accent but he changed it to South African

Joan, his mother, quit her job as a radiographer and spent the next two years helping Martin master a computer program that enabled him to communicate. 

'I don't think I will ever forget that feeling when my mom asked me what I'd like for supper and I said, "Spaghetti Bolognese," and then she actually made that. I know that must seem insignificant, but for me, that was amazing,' he said. 

He had to learn everything again, including reading and how to have a conversation.

He was also soon able to use a wheelchair and drive in a car that operates with his hands, and enrolled in a university to study computer science. He now works as a web designer and in 2011, he released his autobiography, Ghost Boy.

But for him, the greatest joy was meeting Joanna.

'I probably have a somewhat unique perspective on life, I appreciate it a lot,' he told the Today show, with a smile across his face. 'The simple things... To have someone to share your life with, simply to cherish life.'
