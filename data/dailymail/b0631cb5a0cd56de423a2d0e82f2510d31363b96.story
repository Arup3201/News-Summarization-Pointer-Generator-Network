From Poundland  to Poundstretcher, Poundworld and 99p Stores, they seem to be mushrooming.

Poundland - the trailblazer - now has 460 stores in the UK. And where Poundland leads, it seems others follow. Each of the variously named discount stores offers its own unique combination of household goods, supermarket fare, beauty products, homeware, and car accessories.

So, do they all sell the same products? And just how do they keep their prices so low?

Bags of bargains: Tessa with her shopping from Poundland

The chain was founded in 1990 by Steve Smith and his father, Keith, in Burton-on-Trent. After changing hands numerous times, it's now the biggest bargain basement chain in Europe.

A typical shop contains more than 3,000 different products with a wealth of brand names including Heinz, Pepsi, Nivea, Thorntons and Simple.

Of its 4.5 million savvy shoppers, one in five is a middle-class professional.

Poundland says it keeps its prices low by trading directly with major brands.

It either shrinks the size of products or strikes a deal with suppliers to get knock-down prices because of the volume of stock it sells.

TAT OR TREASURE? Huge aisles and clear signs make shopping easy, despite the fact that the Poundland I visit in upmarket Winchester really does sell everything from Horrid Henry children's books to Kellogg's Corn Flakes.

It's bristling with helpful staff - you could almost be in John Lewis.

There are students ogling the hairdye and nail varnishes, pensioners comparing the price of tinned soups and - over in the party section - I'm stunned to see the vicar's wife grabbing armloads of treats for her five-year-old's forthcoming party.

A steal: Tessa picked up armloads of vitamins at bargain prices

BEST FOR: Health and beauty. Poundland is Britain's largest seller of batteries - no surprise when you think that an average four-pack of AAAs costs £2.35.

Other top sellers include umbrellas (2.5 million were sold last year), and Toblerone (5.5 million bars in 2013). It's branching out into chilled food - you can buy a box of ten eggs or a 160g pack of Danish salami.

But it's in the healthcare section that you'll find extraordinary bargains. I picked up armloads of vitamins at a steal.

For example, 90 vitamin D tablets cost £5.10 at Boots. I bought 60 here for £1. They are exactly the same strength, with each tablet containing 200 per cent of my RDA (recommended daily amount.).

 Holland & Barrett charges £6.99 for 60 Evening Primrose Oil capsules - I bought 30 at the same strength (500mg per tablet) for just £1.

I was also delighted with the spectacles. You'd be hard pushed to find a better selection of standard prescription glasses in an optician, although you'll pay a lot more.

The same size bottle of Simple shampoo would cost £2.33 at Sainsbury's. Other brands available include Timotei, Wella, Pantene and Aussie.

Verdict: I'd never been in a Poundland before, but I'll definitely be back!                      4/5

The family-owned Poundworld was launched in Salford, Greater Manchester, in 2004 after rebranding from 'Everything's a £1'. It now has more than 180 stores in the UK, with plans to open a further 200 in the next five years.

You will find cleaning products, toiletries, groceries, toys and party goods, and big names such as Cadbury, Coca-Cola and Johnson's.

Canny boss Chris Edwards buys in bulk at discounted rates from household names, and commissions own-brand products from China.

Cleaning products: Poundworld stocks incredibly cheap cleaners, but there wasn't much else Tessa wanted to buy there

TAT OR TREASURE? Full to bursting with everything from sparkly hair clips and shower curtains to Shredded Wheat and dog chews, this store was also heaving with customers.

There were lots of pensioners with pull-along trolleys full of cat food, and young mums with piercings. I also spotted two Yummy Mummies loading up their Orla Kiely shopping bags with stationery and cleaning products.

BEST FOR: Cleaning products. The same one-litre bottle of Cif floor cleaner is £1.50 at Sainsbury's, while the equivalent bottle of Domestos is £1.25 at Tesco. Zoflora disinfectant costs £1.33 at Tesco and Mr Muscle cleaners are £2 at most supermarkets.

I counted 14 different shampoo brands including Sunsilk, Timotei, Pantene, L'Oreal and Herbal Essences (£1.94 at Boots)

Verdict: My fellow shoppers seemed to disagree, but - cleaning products aside - there wasn't much here I'd want to buy.      3/5

The UK's second largest chain of bargain basement stores, the first 99p Store was opened by shopkeeper Nadir Lalani in Holloway, North London, in 2001. Still a family-run business, there are now more than 200 stores. The company has a turnover of £269 million and attracts more than 1.5 million customers.

You'll find a big range of branded products including Cadbury and Fairy Liquid.

But as the Lalanis specialise in snapping up stock from small businesses that have gone bankrupt (20 per cent of their stock is bought this way) or surplus stock bought direct from large manufacturers, you could end up walking away with anything from a pair of slippers to a family-sized bag of Tyrrells crisps.

Parallel universe: The 99p Store's interior looks like a conventional supermarket but the prices are mind-bogglingly low

TAT OR TREASURE? Walking through the doors of the 99p Store in Eastleigh, Hampshire, I felt I was stepping into a parallel universe.

The aisles are wide and well signed like in a conventional supermarket but the prices are mind-bogglingly low. I spotted several customers in Barbour jackets - all looking as shocked as me at the bargains.

BEST FOR: Stocking up the store cupboard. You couldn't do your weekly shop here - unless you're happy to risk scurvy - as everything comes in tins, jars or packets, but it's a fantastic starting point.

I snapped up armfuls of posh Tyrrells crisps (normally £2.19 at Tesco). Although I suspect they were produced for the summer market - the flavour is Beach Barbecue - I have until February 7 to eat them.

With my baby niece about to visit, I bought two packs of Organix Baby Meals, each containing two meals, for 99p. Admittedly, they only had a three-day shelf life, but the same packs cost £1.50 at Asda. That's three times as much.

Why pay more? Tessa absolutely loved the 99p Store

Admittedly, some of the labels are new to me. I've never heard of Mowbray mayonnaise and it's so watery you wouldn't want a large dollop with your prawns, but it was perfectly serviceable in a ham sandwich. And at 99p for 750g it's a bargain.

I wonder how a 250ml bottle of Morrisons white balsamic vinegar has ended up on the shelf. With a best-before-date of 2017, it's hardly reaching the end of its life.

Verdict: I absolutely loved this place - why pay more for kitchen essentials?                                4.5/5

Eclectic selection: Poundstretcher is like a cross between a jumble sale and an Arabian souk

The first Poundstretcher opened in 1981. Now there are more than 400 branches and the company is the UK's leading discount retailer of products for the home. You won't find many big names but you will find everything from baked beans to conditioner and cushions to bird tables.

If you come here expecting everything for a pound though, you'll be disappointed.

While there is plenty of stock on offer for under a quid, there's also a variety of bigger ticket items with incredible discounts - and free delivery on anything over £10.

Much of the homeware is specially made for Poundstretcher in Asia, and other items are surplus stock from big-name companies.

TAT OR TREASURE? A cross between a jumble sale and an Arabian souk, the shelves heave with a mish-mash of special buys and dreg ends.

I found lamp shades in the bathroom section, stationery among the bedding, and shower gel where the dog food should be. My fellow shoppers seemed unfazed, though.

BEST FOR: Half-price homeware.  A diamante embellished toilet brush for £6.99 may not be your thing, but how about bathroom scales for £3.99 or a double duvet with matching pillows for £9.99?

Admittedly there are few brands, though a lot of the stock is from South Korean company Hyundai. But there's a good selection.

The store I visited in Newbury had a selection of 14 different pillows starting at just £1.99. That's almost as many as you'd find in John Lewis.

I snapped up a Silent Night Airflow pillow for just £6.99. With an RRP of £15.99, the cheapest I could find it elsewhere is £12.97 on Amazon. The pillow is a genuine Silent Night - complete with famous Sleeping Hippo logo.

The catch? The label is misspelt: 'Breath Easy' instead of 'Breathe Easy', something most major retailers would be reluctant to accept. An expensive mistake for someone - but a bargain for me.

Verdict: I'm thrilled with my bargain pillow, but wouldn't give house-room to much else.     3.5/5
