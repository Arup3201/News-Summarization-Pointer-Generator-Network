Scott Kelly went on the run after being released on licence from his jail sentence for attempted murder

A violent criminal who went on the run was caught after police tracked him down using a picture of a sunset which he posted on Facebook.

Scott Kelly spent seven years in prison for attempted murder, but fled last October after he was released on probation.

He travelled to Spain, where he posted photos of himself relaxing in restaurants and drinking with friends.

Police studied the photographs but could find no clues to identify the fugitive’s location – until he posted one picture of a sunset over the sea.

After studying the palm tree-lined promenade they identified the coastline as Alicante and informed authorities in Spain.

Spanish police then spotted Kelly driving around the Costa Blanca resort last month and arrested him.

The runaway was held on a European Arrest Warrant, extradited back to the UK this week and has now been returned to prison.

Kelly, 33, was jailed in March 2005 for attempted murder after he stabbed Stephen Rank in the back during a row in a bar in Exeter.

He served seven years but was released on a five-year licence in April last year and ordered to stay in a bail hostel. 

However in October last year, he defied the terms of his probation by fleeing the hostel and vanishing overseas to enjoy a skiing trip before moving on to Spain.

The picture was one of a number Kelly posted on Facebook showing his trip around Europe while  on the run

His whereabouts remained a mystery until a joint operation between police, Interpol and the National Crime Agency located the crucial photo ‘intelligence’.

Detective Inspector Paul Fell, from organised crime unit Zephyr, said: ‘It quickly became clear that he had breached his licence. 

'We were able to point the Spanish police in the right direction. 

'They don’t like having British criminals living on the Spanish coast believing they are immune from the authorities so they were more than helpful and were very keen to detain him.’

He added: ‘I am sure Scott Kelly went to Spain and was living the high life thinking he was untouchable. Many more may feel the same – but they are not.’ 

A Devon and Cornwall Police spokesman said: ‘It became clear during the investigation that Kelly had an utter disregard for the judicial system and the conditions imposed by the probation service, and felt he was untouchable in Spain.

‘The extradition demonstrates that the force will work with law enforcement agencies to ensure that people who feel that they are above the law will be returned to the UK to serve their sentence.’

Police said he showed an 'utter disregard' for the legal system by posting photos of his life as a fugitive

The photos even included a picture of Kelly's skiing trip before he headed to Spain's Costa Blanca
