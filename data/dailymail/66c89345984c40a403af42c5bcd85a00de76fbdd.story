Arsenal dynamo Alexis Sanchez can already consider himself a legend in the game, according to former Real Madrid and Chile star Ivan Zamora.

The Chilean was highly admired before leaving Barcelona for the Gunners in a £35million deal. Sanchez's stock has risen in the Premier League where he has scored 19 goals in all competitions and could finish his debut season with a Champions League finish and the FA Cup.

The Arsenal forward, who starred during Chile's 1-0 friendly defeat to Brazil at the Emirates on Sunday, is also in the top five most capped players and leading goal scorers for his country - leading Zamorano to insist the 26-year-old has already earned a place in Chilean football folklore.

Former Chile great Zamorano scored 34 goals in 69 appearances for his country

Sanchez's scoring for club and country over last few seasons:

                                                  App    Goals

2011 - 14          Barcelona        88       39

2014 -               Arsenal            27       13

2006 -               Chile                77       26

Speaking to the Daily Star, Zamorano said: 'Alexis Sanchez has already earned a place in the history of Chilean football, I've no doubt about that.

'He's playing at the highest level, he has shown he can be a 'leading actor' in the biggest teams of the world such as Barcelona and Arsenal.

 'He's not just one of the best attackers, but one of the best Chilean players of all time.

The former Real Madrid and Inter Milan attacker, who scored 34 goals in 69 appearances for Chile, only regrets never sharing the same pitch as the flying forward.

'I'm very proud to have played with some of the best forward in the world but I'd have loved to play with Alexis.'

Sanchez has had a sensational debut season in the Premier League following his £35m arrival

Meanwhile, having made a lightning-quick start to his Premier League career, Sanchez feels he is now well adapted to the ways of the English top flight.

'I'm well adapted to the country and the league now. I must keep on learning, though,' he said.

'I want to expand my knowledge of English football in general, and Arsenal and my team-mates in particular.

'But overall I love this league. At the end of the day, football was invented in this country, right? I live where football was invented. That makes me really happy.'
