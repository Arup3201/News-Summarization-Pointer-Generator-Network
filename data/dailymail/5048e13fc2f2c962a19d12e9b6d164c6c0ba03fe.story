Robin Roberts and Josh Elliott had a chance to shake Pope Francis' hand as the two Good Morning America anchors traveled to Vatican City to attend todayâ€™s year-end public mass.

Today's mass held in St Peter's Square was the final papal audience of 2013, capping off a year of renewed public popularity due to the new Pope. 

The anchors were two of thousands that gathered in the square for mass and were lucky to have the Pope shake their hands while he greeted some of the awaiting masses.

Robin, who previously visited the Vatican before her bone marrow transplant two years ago, said that she was very emotional during the meeting as she saw it as a reflection of how her life has changed.

She told the Pope, whose popularity has surged since he was elected earlier this year, that she has been praying for him every day.

Josh tried to connect with the Pontiff on a more personal level, attempting to speak Italian to the 77-year-old.

When that failed, he switched over to English and drew on his schoolboy roots from Loyola High School, saying: 'I'm a Jesuit boy.'

Pope Francis has won over Catholics and atheists alike since being elected in March to replace Pope Benedict and was selected as the Time Magazine Person of the Year.

Robin called it 'a profoundly moving experience to say the very, very least.'

During their stay, the anchors toured the Vatican, met with the famed Swiss guards who are tasked with protecting the Pope, and interviewed a newlywed American couple.

They were in town taking advantage of a program that stipulates that the Pope will meet with any couple who have gotten married in the past three months if they travel to the Vatican, wearing the clothes they got married in and bring their marriage license with them.

'It was amazing to have Pope Francis come up to us personally,' the husband said to GMA.

The cohosts and newlyweds were not the only ones to win some special attention from the head of the church, as he showed his personal biases with a special ceremony on today for his beloved San Lorenzo soccer team after they won the Argentine championship.

Today's service was Francis' last general audience for 2013, during which the pope received birthday wishes (it was his birthday yesterday) and someone even offered him a sip of mate, the traditional Argentine tea.

The Vatican also released year-end statistics on Francis' papacy, saying at least 1,548,500 tickets had been distributed over the course of Francis' 30 audiences in his first nine months in office.

For comparison's sake, 810,000 tickets were distributed in Benedict XVI's first year in 2005, during which he held 32 audiences after his April 19 election.

In 2005, the Vatican said 2.85 million people had participated in Benedict's public events that first year, which included all his Masses, Sunday blessings and World Youth Day events in Cologne, Germany.

Francis drew 3.7 million people alone to his concluding World Youth Day Mass in Rio de Janeiro in July, though statisticians put the actual figure at less than half that.
