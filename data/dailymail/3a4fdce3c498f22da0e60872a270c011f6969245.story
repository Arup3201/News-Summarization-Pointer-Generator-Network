Actress and former Miss America Vanessa Williams has spoken out about being molested by an 18-year-old girl when she was only ten-years-old and how it's had a negative impact on her psychologically.

Vanessa Williams opened up on Oprah's Master Class and spoke about a traumatic summer before she entered the fifth grade when a much older 'cool girl' performed oral sex on her when she was staying with her friend's family's friends in California.

Even though Williams thought that her friend's family friend's daughter was 'cool' at first she knew that what happened between them 'wasn't supposed to be happening.'

Vanessa Williams spoke of her traumatic experience of being molested by an 18-year-old girl when she was only 10-years-old

'She was one of the cool girls,' said Williams.

'She made you want to feel like you were a grown-up.'

One night when Williams and her friend were sleeping, the older girl sneaked into their room and woke Williams with a strange request.

'She told me to lie down on the floor. She took my bottoms off and she said, 'Be quiet,' Williams says. 'She went down on me.'

Williams couldn't really understand what was happening and was conflicted about the encounter.

'I had no idea what it was, but I knew it felt good,' she says. 

'I knew it felt good, but  was also something that was not supposed to be happening.'

Williams
 never told her parents about what happened because the moment she 
stepped off the plane she learned of a family tragedy and didn't have 
the courage to bring up the incident with her family.

'I saw my dad's face and his face was gray. And I just found out that his brother had died,' said Williams.

Williams spoke about how the incident made her sexually promiscuous at an inappropriate age

Vanessa Williams says she wished she could had the innocent experience of having her first kiss at 16 but that being molested made her act out sexually at a young age

'That was a family drama. I never really talked to my dad about it. I kind of suppressed it.'

Williams says that the incident sexualized her at an innapproproately early age and that in a way it took away some of her innocence.

'It awakens your sexuality at an age where it shouldn't be awakened,' said Williams.

'Had that not happened in my life and had I had an opportunity to have a normal courtship with a boyfriend at 16 or whatever... there wouldn't have been that shame that was always haunting me. It made me more sexually promiscuous and more sexually curious at a younger age than I should have been.'
