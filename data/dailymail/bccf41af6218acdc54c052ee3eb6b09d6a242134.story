It was hailed as the future of cinema. But it seems Britain’s 3D boom may be over before it really began.

Film fans fed up with inflated  prices are choosing to stick with the traditional 2D format instead.

The British Film Institute said 3D films accounted for a fifth of box office revenues last year compared to almost a quarter two years ago.

Legacy: Film fans fed up with inflated prices and disillusioned by the lack of added value from watching many movies in the format, opted to stick with traditional 2D showings instead

While 47 3D films were released in 2011 – an increase of almost 20 on 2010 – takings were down.

According to research compiled by the British Film Institute 3D films accounted for a fifth of box office revenues last year compared to almost a quarter two years ago.

It found the average cinema in the UK made £32,000 from 3D films in 2010 but this had slumped by half to £16,000 in 2011.

The BFI report said: ‘This year saw signs that UK cinema goers are becoming more selective in their choice of 3D films, choosing the format for films where it makes a real contribution to their experience but sticking to 2D where they don’t perceive any added value.’

It had been expected the 3D trend would soar after the success of James Cameron’s epic Avatar, which made £615 million worldwide, with 90 per cent of the audience watching in 3D, and the huge popularity of Toy Story 3.

Hit: TT3D: Closer to the Edge was hugely popular in the format- grossing more than £1.2 million

But after an initial burst of interest it appears British cinema-goers don’t feel it represents value for money for every film.

The major cinema groups charge customers of 3D films up to 41 per cent more than those seeing standard films and many charge an additional £1 for the special glasses.

A spokesman for the BFI explained: ‘Perhaps audiences are becoming more discerning in terms of how they choose 3D and whether to pay the premium prices.

‘They will choose [to watch the format] when it enhances the experience. Audiences can see where the 3D conversion may not be worth the extra few pounds on the ticket. ‘

He added that instead consumers were opting to watch in 3D when they felt it really made a difference.

For example, motor-racing documentary TT3D: Closer to the Edge was hugely popular in the format – grossing more than £1.2 million, which made it one of the most popular documentaries of the year.

Similarly the re-release of the Lion King in 3D was an “event” which meant many wanted to watch a classic in a new format, grossing more than £15 million.

Avatar and Toy Story 3 were huge hits in the format in the UK in 2009 and 2010, grossing £67million and £73.8 million respectively in the UK.

By contrast the only standout 3D hit last year was the final film in the Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2, which was the final film in the franchise and grossed £73 million.

The rest of the 3D top five for 2011, which included Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides, grossed under £30 million.

A recent YouGov poll found that almost half of Britons thought the format was “over-hyped and just a phase”.

Another reason for the slump in interest, is that 2011 saw a rise in the popularity of character-led films in Britain such as The Kings Speech, which made £45.7 million, and Bridesmaids, which made £23 million, and these do not need the special technology.

Daily Mail film critic Chris Tookey said that consumers have also wised up to the fact that sum of the “3D films” are simply a rip off.

He has said: ‘Hollywood has jumped on the 3D bandwagon and is driving it hell-for-leather.

‘The irony is that many of the 3D movies that cinema-goers are paying over the odds for aren’t really in 3D at all.’

He pointed to Justin Bieber’s Never Say Never Again, which actually on featured just 30 minutes of his concert in that format.

An additional problem is that some people feel unwell when watching in this format.

Around 10 per cent of the UK population has poor binocular vision, which means it is difficult for them to see 3D effects in movies and video games.

Instead, they see a blurry image, and will suffer headaches, eye strain and even nausea as a result.

Experts do not recommend allowing children under eight to regularly use 3D glasses because their eye muscles are still developing.

There are also question marks over whether 3D television will really take off, with some industry figures insisting that until a “glasses-free, affordable” option is available it is unlikey to.

Some electronics manufacturers have issued disclaimers to protect themselves from legal claims warning that viewing 3D TV may cause ‘motion sickness’, ‘disorientation’ and ‘eye strain’.

Last year, Sir David Attenborough warned 3D television would not take off in Britain.

The veteran, whose documentary for Sky - Flying Monsters - was made in the format, insisted it would not become the norm for viewers because it was ‘too isolating’.

Instead Sir David said consumers would opt to watch ‘big events’ in 3D such as World Cup football matches, Olympic sports, ground-breaking new nature or history shows.
