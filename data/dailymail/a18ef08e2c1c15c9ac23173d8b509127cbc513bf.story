Police who raided the home of convicted sex offender Neil Waters, 50, found a DVD containing forty excerpts from films which had been screened on television

A man accused of possessing child pornography has been cleared after a judge heard his videos were taken from terrestrial TV.

Police who raided the home of convicted sex offender Neil Waters, 50, found a DVD containing 40 excerpts from films which had been screened on television.

None of the films was pornographic, and they could be legitimately and legally viewed by the public, Gloucester Crown Court was told.

Judge Jamie Tabor ruled that whatever 
motive Waters had for gathering the film clips together, they could not 
be regarded as indecent within the meaning of the law.

On hearing his ruling, prosecutor 
Virgina Cornwall said the Crown would not continue with the nine charges
against Waters of making indecent images of children between 2008 and 
2011.

Waters has been on the sex offender register since 2006 when he was jailed for child porn offences.

The court heard that following the raid on his home on February 28 this year Waters, who was on parole, was recalled to prison to continue serving his sentence and he has remained behind bars since then.

Ms Cornwall told Judge Tabor: 'We invite
the court to rule on the admissibility of these images. They were found
in somewhat unusual circumstances.

'The defendant was at the time a 
registered sex offender who had been released from prison and was living
in the community. As a result of information received, officers 
attended his home and during a search found a disc in his shed.

'That
disc contained 40 clips of principally young girls that had been taken 
from films broadcast on terrestrial TV. VHS tapes were also found and it
is clear that the excerpts on the disc came from them. They were 
perfectly legitimate terrestrial TV films.'

Judge Tabor said, 'I understand there was no question of them coming from pay-per-view TV, but from films any member of the public could have seen.'

Ms Cornwall replied, 'Yes, they were films shown at any time without restrictions on them which are not pornographic in nature at all. They are innocuous, generally speaking.'

Waters' lawyer said: 'The defendant has not purchased these images. He has just taped what has been on TV. Anyone could have recorded them.'

Giving his ruling, Judge Tabor said he had viewed a selection of the clips and they were undoubtedly of children but they would not be considered by the public to be indecent nowadays - and probably would not have been seen as indecent even 30 years ago.

If the case went to trial, he said, the jury would not be allowed to consider the motivation for Waters making the recordings and the disc.

The children shown in the clips were 'predominately of children in semi-undressed state,' he said.

'He may well have derived some form of gratification, sexual or otherwise, by looking at scantily clad young children - for example in an aboriginal cave talking to their mother.

'But if one removes the motivation for making these clips one is left with the images themselves and one asks oneself objectively are they indecent? They are not.'

Ms Cornwall offered no evidence on the nine charges in the light of the judge's ruling and Waters was formally found not guilty.
