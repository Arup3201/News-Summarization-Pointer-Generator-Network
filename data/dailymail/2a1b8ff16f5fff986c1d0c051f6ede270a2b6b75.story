The mother of a 19-year-old model who died of cervical cancer after doctors failed to allow her a smear test has questioned why her daughter was refused the simple examination.

The NHS scrapped routine smears for under-25s in 2003 over concerns they could do more harm than good.

But Sophie Jones' mother, Peri Cawley, 47, has launched a campaign – called Sophie’s Choice – to get the minimum age for automatic smear tests cut to 16.

Sophie Jones, of Eastham, 
Merseyside, had suffered crippling stomach pains for over a year before 
she was initially diagnosed with Crohn's disease, it was claimed

Speaking to The Sun, Mrs Cawley, of Eastham, Wirral, said: ‘It took her nearly a year and ten GP appointments to get diagnosed, which just isn’t good enough.

‘Who knows what could have been had she been given a smear test. Girls are getting boob jobs on the NHS to make themselves feel better. What’s the cost of a smear test compared to that?’

Aspiring model Sophie, who had just walked in her first catwalk show, was told she was too young to have a smear test when she complained of crippling stomach pains last February.

She was only diagnosed correctly with cervical cancer in November, by which time the disease had spread all over her body. She died on March 15.

Miss Jones was described by her sister, Stephanie, as 'a very calming influence on everyone around her'

Mrs Cawley was at her daughter's bedside when she passed away but said it was too difficult to watch as her daughter took her last breath.

She said: ‘I held her hand. I could never say goodbye to Sophie because she will always be with me.

‘If we can do something to make sure this doesn’t happen to someone else, then Sophie’s death won’t have been in vain.’

The petition launched by Sophie’s family, including her mother Peri, father Jason, 41, twin sister Ashleigh, 19, sisters Chelsea 24, Stephanie, 28, and Natasha, 23, and brothers Kris, 26, and Andy, 26, has now received more than 300,000 signatures.

Mrs Cawley said they put the word ‘choice’ in the name of the campaign on purpose.

She
 said: ‘The word “choice” in the campaign means that people should have 
just that – a choice. If a girl presents at a doctor’s with symptoms she
 should be given the pros and cons of being tested.’

Labour health spokesman Luciana Berger said: ‘Women can have a cervical smear test at any age if their doctor thinks it’s necessary to help in diagnosis, so we must understand what went wrong in this case to ensure such a tragedy does not happen again.’

The programme was introduced for girls in school in 2008 with the aim of eventually cutting the incidence of cervical cancer by up to 70 per cent.

A spokesman for the Department of Health said: ‘This is a tragic case.

The issue was last debated in Parliament in 2009, but the best independent evidence still shows that routine screening of women under 25 does more harm than good.

‘Cervical cancer in women under 25s is extremely rare. In 2011, there were 47 cases of cervical cancer in women under 25 and no deaths.’

Miss Jones' family and friends are now calling for younger women to be offered cervical cancer screening

Screening: The test is currently offered to women aged 25 or over

The NHS offers a free cervical screening test to all women aged 25-64 every three to five years.

It is not a test for cervical cancer, but it identifies early abnormalities which, if left untreated, could develop into cancer of the cervix (neck of the womb).

A sample of cells is taken from the cervix for analysis and sent to a laboratory for analysis.  Those whose cells show abnormalities are called back for further investigation and, if necessary, treatment.

Currently the test is not offered routinely to women aged younger than 25 because cervical cancer is so rare in women that young.  According to Cancer Research UK statistics, not a single woman under the age of 20 died from cervical cancer between 2009-2011.

The lower age of 25 was raised from 20 after the Advisory Committee on Cervical Cancer Screening (ACCS) advised the NHS in 2003 that cervical screening in younger women did more harm than good.

The committee advised that cell abnormalities in younger women normally went away of their own accord, and said that sending young women for further tests and treatment increased the likelihood of the woman having pre-term delivery if she went on to have children, and could cause significant anxiety.

Many other countries offer cervical screening from the age of 25, including Italy, France, Belgium and Ireland.  In Scotland, women are invited to be checked from the age of 20, though it is due to go up to 25 next year.  In Australia women are invited from 18, Greece from 20, and in the US two years after women become sexually active.

Meanwhile, other countries start cervical screening later. Both the Netherlands and Finland offer screening to women only once they are 30, and these two countries boast some of the lowest mortality rates for cervical cancer in Europe, and in Bulgaria it is for women over 31.
