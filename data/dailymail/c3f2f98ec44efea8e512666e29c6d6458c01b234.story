President Obama opened up to an audience of students at the University of Malaya on Sunday and confessed that his greatest regret in life has been not spending more time with his mom before her untimely death in 1995.

For more than an hour during the town hall-style meeting, young Malaysians questioned the President about a range of issues that tended more towards personal topics rather than a quizzing on the finer points of U.S.-Asian policy.

When one student asked Obama about his biggest regrets, the President reflected on his mother Ann Dunham, who died from ovarian cancer in 1995 aged just 52.

The President answered questions from students at Malaya University during the 80-minute Young Southeast Asian Leaders Initiative in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia

‘I regret not having spent more time with my mother,’ said Obama. ‘Because she died early - she got cancer right around when she was my age, actually, she was just a year older than I am now - she died.  It happened very fast, in about six months.’

‘There was a stretch of time from when I was, let’s say, 20 until I was 30, where I was so busy with my own life that I didn’t always reach out and communicate with her and ask her how she was doing and tell her about things,’ Obama said.

'What you remember in the end, I think, is the people you love,' Obama said near the conclusion of the 80-minute Young Southeast Asian Leaders Initiative in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

‘I realized that I didn’t - every single day, or at least more often - just spend time with her and find out what she was thinking and what she was doing, because she had been such an important part of my life.'

Another participant wanted to know about Obama's aspirations as a youngster and whether he had achieved his goals.

The President said he hadn't taken his studies as seriously as he should have during his high school years, reports ABC News.

He described a rebellious youth stemming from his 'complicated' family life, growing up without a father at home, and 'sometimes I was enjoying life too much.'

'You have to focus more on what kind of influence and impact are you going to have on other people’s lives,' he said.

Family is the most significant source of
 happiness, Obama told the audience, but also 'feeling as if I’ve been 
true to my beliefs and that I’ve lived with some integrity.'

When the president was asked what he hopes his legacy will be, he gave a rambling nine-minute answer in which he cited a range of factors including being a good father and a 'great husband.'

In terms of his presidential legacy, he cited his response to the financial crisis after taking office in 2009; promotion of greater economic opportunity for all people; curbing Syria’s chemical weapons; confronting Iran; encouraging peace between Israelis and Palestinians; and, being the first American president to visit Burma. The Affordable Care Act didn't receive a mention.
