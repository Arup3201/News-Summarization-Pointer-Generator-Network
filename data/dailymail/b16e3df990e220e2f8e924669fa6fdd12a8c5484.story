Usain Bolt will run the 200metres at the Athletissima Golden League meeting in Lausanne on 9 July.

It will be Bolt's second big race of the summer, with the six-time Olympic champion from Jamaica also set to line-up in the 100m at the Areva meeting in Paris five days earlier. 

Bolt has yet to finalize the remainder of his summer program before the world championships in Beijing from 22-30 August.

Bolt ran his first race of the season during the Gibson Relays in Kingston, Jamaica on February 28.
