Morgan Schneiderlin says Southampton can 'shock the world' and qualify for the Champions League this season, but refused to commit his future to the club.

The Saints are currently third in the Premier League and look on course to secure a top-four finish after beating Manchester United.

And Schneiderlin, quoted by the BBC, said: 'We want to put Southampton in the spotlight. That will be a shock for the country and the world.

Schneiderlin has been linked with a move away from the club, with United and Arsenal reported to be interested parties. 

And on the prospect of him leaving St Mary's, the 25-year-old France international added: 'That's up to everyone's personal choices and the club choice.

'We are going to see where we are going to finish and what everyone's going to do but right now I can't predict anything.'
