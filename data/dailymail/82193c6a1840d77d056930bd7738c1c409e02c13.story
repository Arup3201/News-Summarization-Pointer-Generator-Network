Scientists have issued the first weather forecast for an alien ‘super-Earth’ orbiting a star 40 light years from Earth.

Using the Hubble Space Telescope to study
 light filtering through the planet's atmosphere, U.S. astronomers 
determined that the planet GJ 1214b is shrouded by high-altitude clouds.

The world orbits very close to its ‘red dwarf’ parent star, too, raising temperatures to 232°C and the scientists predict it's going to remain cloudy and hot for the forseeable future.

Its parent star also raises temperatures to 232°C and these weather conditions are expected to last 'for the foreseeable future'

GJ 1214b was discovered in 2009 by the
 MEarth Project.

It is roughly 2.7 times larger than the Earth and its star lies in the constellation Ophiuchus.

Using the Hubble Space Telescope to study

determined that the planet GJ 1214b is shrouded by high-altitude clouds.

Earlier studies of the planet were not 
able to tell whether it had clear or cloudy skies but now scientists are 
confident it is both hot and permanently overcast - a little like Venus 
in our own Solar System.

As was the case with Venus until the era 
of space probes, the cloud cover makes it impossible to know exactly what the 
planet's surface is like.

GJ 1214b, whose star lies in the constellation Ophiuchus, is roughly 2.7 times larger than the Earth.

Earlier studies of the planet were not 
able to tell whether it had clear or cloudy skies but now scientists are 
confident it is both hot and permanently overcast - a little like Venus 
in our own Solar System.

What these clouds are made of is still unknown, but computer simulations suggest they could be composed of potassium chloride or zinc sulphide dust.

Super-Earths, planets having a mass between that of the Earth and Neptune, are believed to be among the most common in our galaxy.

Dr Jacob Bean, leader of the University of Chicago astronomers, said: 'I think it’s very exciting that we can use a telescope like Hubble that was never designed with this in mind, do these kinds of observations with such exquisite precision, and really nail down some property of a small planet orbiting a distant star.'

The observations took around 96 hours 
spread over 11 months - the longest period ever devoted to studying a 
single exoplanet with the space telescope.

Dr
 Bean's team analysed near-infrared light from the planet each time it 
passed in front of, or 'transited', its star, an event that occurs every
 38 hours.

GJ 1214b was discovered in 2009 by the MEarth Project. It is roughly 2.7 times larger than the Earth and its star lies in the constellation Ophiuchus. It is called a super-Earth because it has a mass between that of the Earth and Neptune, pictured. Exoplanet GJ 436b is shown here to demonstrate scale

Writing in Nature, the scientists described the findings as an important milestone on the way to identifying potentially habitable Earth-like planets among the stars.

Follow-up observations suggested that the planet’s atmosphere was either mostly composed of water vapour or dominated by hydrogen with high-altitude clouds.

The new study ruled out a cloud-free atmosphere of water, methane, nitrogen, carbon monoxide or carbon dioxide.

A 'flat' signal from the Hubble data, lacking chemical fingerprints, indicated the presence of high altitude clouds of uncertain composition shielding what lay beneath.

The U.S. space agency Nasa's 6.5 metre James Webb Space Telescope, due to be placed in orbit later this decade, is expected to reveal more information about exoplanet atmospheres.

'Looking forward, JWST will be transformative,' said graduate student Laura Keidberg, another member of the University of Chicago team.

'The new capabilities of this telescope will allow us to peer through the clouds on planets like GJ 1214b. But more than that, it may open the door to studies of Earth-like planets around nearby stars.'
