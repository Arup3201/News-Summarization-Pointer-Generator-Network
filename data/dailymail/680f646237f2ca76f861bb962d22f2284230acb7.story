It nearly didn’t make it on to our screens because TV bosses feared a drama about the grim realities of midwifery in the 1950s would be, well, too grim.

So it’s all the more remarkable that BBC1’s Call The Midwife has not only enjoyed record-breaking viewing figures, but also inspired a new generation of midwives.

Despite the show’s realistic birth scenes – made all the more gritty thanks to the advice of an on-set midwife – applications for midwifery courses have soared since the show first aired last year. 

Surge: The popularity of Call the Midwife, the show which has made actress Miranda Hart a household name, has seen applications for midwifery courses soar

Ucas, the official university and college applications body, said there was a 16.5 per cent rise in midwifery applications last year, with universities around the UK reporting a similar trend.

Cardiff University saw a 24 per cent increase in applications for its courses for 2012/13, while Anglia Ruskin University in Cambridgeshire has seen an 11.6 per cent rise for students wishing to enrol in September 2013, compared with last year.

Senior lecturer in midwifery at Anglia Ruskin, Frances Galloway, said the programme, which stars Miranda Hart and Jenny Agutter, was often mentioned on application forms for her course.

She added: ‘Call the Midwife has helped to highlight the profession of midwifery and bring it to the fore in a way that it hadn’t been previously.

‘It has made people more open to considering it as a career in its own entity not just as a part of nursing. And it is its own career so that is very important.’

Gail Johnson, professional adviser for education at the Royal College of Midwives, said the programme gave people the chance to consider entering the career, adding: ‘The programme portrays the midwives working in the community, right at the heart of families.’ 

Gritty: The show follows the lives of midwives in 1950s East London and features realistic birth scenes

Writer of the series, Heidi Thomas also noticed the programme’s effect on the profession after she met the head of midwifery at  Glamorgan University.

Miss Thomas said: ‘She came over and said: “I run a nursing hospital at a university in Wales and you have made my life extremely difficult”.

'Very proud': The show has helped to inspire a new generation of trainee midwives

‘She said she used to struggle to fill her midwifery course which has 16 places each year and this year she had almost 1,000 applications for those places.’

She said she was ‘very proud’ to have ‘shone a light on midwifery’.

The show, which returns for a second series this year, attracted an average of 8.7million viewers last year, making it the biggest new drama series on BBC1 since records began in 2001.

It follows the day-to-day lives of young midwives in 1950s East London and deals with the hardships they faced.

Now in its second series, Call the Midwife, which has turned comic actress Hart into a household name, is based on a trilogy of books by late author Jennifer Worth, and has been adapted to script by Heidi Thomas, who also worked on Cranford.

Professional midwife Terri Coates is consulted on every scene and is on set to advise.

Real babies are used throughout, the youngest just four days old, and the birth scenes are so realistic that producers feared a backlash from viewers. 

‘Everybody said no one will watch this show. Everyone said men won’t watch it, women won’t watch it, pregnant women will be frightened by it, so it didn’t really leave a very big audience,’ Miss Thomas said. 

The show’s success saw the first series end on a high with 9.2million viewers tuning in to watch the final episode, resulting in a series average overnight of 8.7million which made it the biggest new drama series on the channel since records began (in 2001).

And the link to midwifery applications has made the production team ‘very proud,’ Miss Thomas said. ‘We’ve shone a light on midwifery.’
