Egypt’s top court said it was suspending its work indefinitely to protest against the ‘psychological assassination’ of its judges.

The declaration came after supporters of the country’s Islamist president prevented the judges from entering the courthouse yesterday.

The strike is the latest turn in a crisis pitting President Mohammed Morsi and his Islamist allies against the mostly secular opposition.

The standoff began when Morsi issued a
package of decrees on Nov. 22 that gave him sweeping powers and 
extended immunity from the courts to a panel tasked with drafting a new 
constitution.

The 
Islamist-dominated panel then raced in a marathon session last week to 
vote on the new charter’s 230 clauses without the participation of 
liberal and Christian members.

The
fast-track hearing preempted a decision expected from the court on 
Sunday on whether to dissolve the committee - a ruling the judges 
postponed on Sunday.

Morsi
announced at the weekend that he would hold a referendum on the draft 
charter on December 15, despite opposition protests and questions about 
the document’s legitimacy.

'It is the Egyptian judiciary’s blackest 
day on record,' the court said in a statement carried by the official 
MENA news agency, describing the scene outside the court complex, with 
Islamists carrying banners denouncing the tribunal and some of its 
judges.

Supporters of Morsi, who hails from the fundamentalist Muslim Brotherhood, claim that the court’s judges are loyalists of ousted president Hosni Mubarak.

Mubarak appointed them to their positions, and Morsi supporters say they are trying to derail the country’s transition to democratic rule.

The court statement said the judges approached the court but decided against entering the building because they feared for their safety.

'The judges of the Supreme Constitutional Court were left with no choice but to announce to the glorious people of Egypt that they cannot carry out their sacred mission in this charged atmosphere,' the statement said.

The judges also were expected to rule to on the legitimacy of the Islamist-dominated upper house of parliament, known as the Shura Council.

By suspending its work, the court joined the country’s highest appeals court and its sister lower court in their indefinite strike to protest what they see as Morsi’s infringement on the judiciary.

Most judges and prosecutors in the country have been on strike for a week.
