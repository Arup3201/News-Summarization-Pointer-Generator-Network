He is already one of the most famous babies in the world.

So how did Prince George manage to go unnoticed during an  outing with his Spanish nanny in New Zealand recently?

While the Duchess and Duke of Cambridge where thrust under the spotlight of the New Zealand media in Christchurch, it appears baby George flew right under the radar while with his minder, Maria Borallo.

Witnesses say they saw the world's most in-demand nine-month-old in a park during a day out in the New Zealand capital.

Wellington ice cream business owner Barry Ludlow told Fairfax Media Prince George was accompanied by Ms Barallo, who is trained at the prestigious Norland College which has been producing childminders for the rich and famous since 1892.

He said he served her up a 99c cone, which Ms Barallo took to nearby Frank Kitts Park along with Prince George.

'There were plenty of people walking around the waterfront, there were children everywhere, but I don't think anyone saw them. They didn't look out of place at all.'

It is an incredible feat considering the amount of attention baby George drew while with mum and dad during the royal tour Down Under.

Mr Ludlow said he thought he was the only one who recognised George, who was largely obscured from view inside his pram.

Well trained: Ms Borallo is a Norland nanny who has worked with other prominent high-society families in the past.

He said he'd served icecream to plenty of famous people in the past and didn't treat his sighting of baby George has any different.

Mr Ludlow's sighting was corroborated by two other sources close to the royal tour, according to Fairfax NZ.

One said: 'I can say that it definitely happened.'

'I certainly don't think it was meant to be hidden that the little prince was playing in the park.'

Even the city's mayor didn't deny the rumours, when contacted by Fairfax.

She said she hoped they enjoyed a chance to have some peace and quiet without being recognised.

Ludlow said he could not remember the date, but details of the weather that afternoon suggest it was April 14, when William and Kate left George at Government House in Wellington while they visited Christchurch.

A spokesman for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge declined to make a comment.
