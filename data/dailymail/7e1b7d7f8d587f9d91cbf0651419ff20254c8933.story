Spain has been cleared by European officials for increasing security along the Gibraltan border and causing up to six hours of delays.

The European Commisssion ruled that Spain hasn't broken any EU laws by imposing the stringent checks.

Instead it recommended that Britain works with its European neighbour to bring down tobacco smuggling and other border crime, reasons given by Spain for upping security.

Border queues have been causing diplomatic tensions as Gibraltar citizens claim they are in retaliation for trying to build an artificial reef in disputed waters

However, it did say that the crossing point is 'challenging,
in view of the heavy traffic volumes in a relatively confined space and
the increase in tobacco smuggling into Spain'.

A Foreign Office spokesman said: 'We welcome the commission's recommendations that the Spanish government should take measures to ensure that the Gibraltar-Spain border functions efficiently, and the commission's commitment to review progress against their recommendations in six months.'

Gibraltar has long believed that the checks were put in place after it decided to build an artificial reef in contested waters off the island.

The ensuing diplomatic row saw the Rock's chief minister Fabian Picardo 
brand the Spanish government 'neanderthal' after likening its actions to North Korea.

However Spanish officials says they are necessary to stop smuggling and have nothing to do with disputes over Gibraltar's sovereignty

The allegations were made after Spain's foreign minister Jose Manuel 
Garcia-Margallo threatened to charge motorists Â£43 a time to cross.

Gibraltar also 
accused Spain of flying military jets across the island, sailing boats 
into British waters, and even claimed the military shot at a jet-skier as he rode waves near the coast.

Up to 10,000 vehicles a day were individually checked in 30 degree heat at the peak of the crisis in July, leading to six hour queues to leave the territory.

In August Britain sent ten warships, including aircraft carrier Illustrious, to take part in military exercises in British waters, with three ships, including HMS Westminster, stopping at a base on the island.

Despite the move following just days after Gibraltar's chief minister asked for more ships, British officials said the exercise was routine.
