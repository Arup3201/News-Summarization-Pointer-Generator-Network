First, he submerged people and a Volkswagen Beetle deep below the ocean's surface.

Now, he has built underwater homes for them to live in.

Beautiful sculptures made by British artist Jason deCaires Taylor are transforming the seabed into a real-life city of Atlantis.

His elegant new buildings in the Isla Mujeres National Marine Park, Mexico, will not only house his earlier works, but are designed to be homes for marine life.

The houses took six months in total to 
build and were transported from Cancun to Isla Mujeres by car ferry before a 40-ton crane was used to place them on the seabed.

Two years ago, he sank 400 individually cast human moulds of the Mexican public into the water in the area to create the basis of his artificial reef.

In June 2011, he lowered a concrete VW classic into the water, complete with a female figure curled up on the bonnet and with holes in the windows to let the fish in.

The iconic car even features compartments inside so lobsters can make the vehicle their home.

DeCaires Taylor said: 'In a gallery, you get one perspective. Underwater, you can fly over the sculptures, go between them.

Room at the inn? The magnificent reefs in the area are visited by 750,000 people every year - and now there are some new additions

'The light is very different and is affected by the surface of the sea. It has a lost feel to it, which I really like.'

There is also a practical, ecological 
aspect to his art. 'When I became a diving instructor, I saw the 
decimation of the coral reefs, so I got into the idea of making art as 
artificial reefs,' he said.

'I wanted to create an image of humans living in balance with nature instead of in opposition to it.'

DeCaires Taylor,
who has made similar creations around the world, uses a porous 
pH-neutral concrete, painted with a special substance that encourages 
coral growth, providing the perfect habitat for sea creatures.

It
is hoped that the man-made reef will also reduce the pressure on 
natural reefs in the area, which 750,000 people visit every year.

The ambitious work does come at a price, however.

His latest project at the park on the Yucatan Peninsula cost an eye-watering $200,000.

'I've been diving for about 18 years now and have clocked up over 4,000 hours underwater,' he added.

'All
my family and friends have been very supportive but aren't keen on me 
exposing myself to the dangers of working underwater for such lengths of
time.'

DeCaires Taylor created the 
world's first underwater sculpture park off the coast of 
Grenada in 2006, and the West Indies attraction is now listed as one of National Geographic's Top 25 Wonders
of the World.
