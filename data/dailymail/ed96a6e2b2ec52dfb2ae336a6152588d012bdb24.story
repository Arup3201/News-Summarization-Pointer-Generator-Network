Prince Harry and his girlfriend Cressida Bonas enjoyed a rare public outing together today when they headed to Twickenham to watch England defeat Wales at rugby.

The sports-mad royal is a regular at England games, but this is believed to be the first time that 24-year-old Cressida has joined him for a match.

Although they are believed to have been in a relationship for almost two years, the couple are rarely seen in public together so this latest appearance will prompt speculation that their relationship is getting serious.

Outing: Prince Harry and his girlfriend Cressida Bonas enjoyed a day out at Twickenham to watch England take on Wales

The look of love: Cressida gazes adoringly at her royal boyfriend, who sported a pair of sunglasses as the couple watched the match together

Smiling: The couple chat as they watch the action on the pitch

While Harry could be seen roaring his team on from the sidelines, Cressida seemed more reserved as the couple watched England's penultimate Six Nations match, which England won 29-18.

The couple seemed at ease in each others' company, smiling in the spring sunshine, as on several occasions Cressida gazed adoringly at the 29-year-old prince.

Although the couple's relationship has largely been conducted in private, with just a few snatched pictures emerging of the pair, this is one of the first times they have appeared publicly together.

However, in recent weeks the pair were seen dining at upmarket London restaurant The Ivy, and on Friday she was in attendance as he made a speech at a We Day charity event at Wembley Arena in London.

Proud: the couple joined thousands of fans to sing the national anthem prior to the start of the match

Singalong: Harry is a regular at England matches, although this is believed to be the first time that Cressida has joined him

The event was the first time Cressida has attended an official function with Harry, who was the star speaker at 
the 'global youth empowerment' day, with other star billings including 
singer Ellie Goulding, rap star Dizzee Rascal, and actress Jennifer 
Hudson.

Cressida is now 
thought to be living at Kensington Palace with Harry and on Valentine's 
Day, was spotted picking up an M&S meal for two for the pair to 
enjoy.

And it's not the first time that she - and her royal beau - have opted to keep things low key.

Other
recent dates have included trips to high street burger chain Byron and 
to see the Cirque du Soleil production of Quidam at the Royal Albert 
Hall.

Prior to the match, 
both Harry and Cressida joined in the national anthem, singing along 
with the rest of the 82,000-strong crowd.

Gripping: The couple watch the crunch match, which could go some way to deciding who wins the sought-after trophy

Concentration: Harry and Cressida watch the game among other England fans

During the game the couple chatted to
 one another, with Harry leaning in close to hear his girlfriend against
 the roar of the fans.

The 
prince wore a pair of aviator-style sunglasses to shield his eyes from 
the glare of the March sunshine, while dance graduate Cressida sported 
her own shades atop her head.

Harry also proudly showed his allegiance with an England polo shirt and Cressida wore a co-ordinating white top, which she paired with a large pair of gold hooped earrings.

Last week the prince was named as patron of the RFU's All Schools campaign, which is aiming to bring rugby to 750 more schools by the Rugby World Cup in 2019.

He is also Vice Patron of the RFU and Patron of the RFU Injured Players Foundation.

Quick tipple: Cressida could be seen holding what appeared to be a beer in a plastic cup as she left the stadium with Harry
