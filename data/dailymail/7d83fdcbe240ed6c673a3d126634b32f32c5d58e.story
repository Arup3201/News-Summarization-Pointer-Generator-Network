A mentally disable man accidentally shot his sister to death with a gun he though was a toy.

Marcus Anderson, 20, of St. Louis, Missouri, is alleged to have shot sister Alicia Anderson, 15, with a spray painted shotgun Thursday. He was arraigned Friday on a charge of second-degree involuntary manslaughter and is currently in police custody.

Marcus Anderson allegedly told investigators he didn’t know the gun was real, according to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.

Authorities say Marcus Anderson shot his younger sister with a gold spray-painted 20-gauge shotgun he found hidden behind a dresser, the paper reported.

The gun was owned by a family friend who moved in with the Andersons a few days earlier, police said.

After his sisters told him ‘to stop playing around with the gun,’ Marcus Anderson allegedly pointed it at his sister and shot her in the head, according to the paper.

In being charged with second-degree involuntary manslaughter, officials are trying to prove criminal negligence is involved and might take into account Marcus Anderson’s mental condition, officials told the paper.

‘It’s a heartbreaking case, no question about it,’ St. Louis Circuit Attorney’s Office spokesperson Susan Ryan told the paper. “These kinds of cases are the hardest when it comes to how prosecutors make charging decisions, but their job is to follow the evidence and the law.’

Marcus Anderson is currently being held on $20,000 bail.
