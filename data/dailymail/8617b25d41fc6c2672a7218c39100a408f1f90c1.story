South African prison bosses have hit back at 'inaccurate, serious allegations' in the Oscar Pistorius trial that the country's jails are violent and disease-ridden. 

Despite saying they didn't want to interfere in the decision about whether Pistorius is sent to jail, the Department of Correctional Services today issued a statement defending their facilities.

It said: 'The image of our correctional centres, our department and our government in general is at stake. We therefore deem it appropriate that we register our concern.'

Oscar Pistorius is comforted by his brother Carl Pistorius as his defense lawyer, Barry Roux looks on; the court has been told that Pistorius could be vulnerable to physical and sexual violence in imprisoned 

The court was also told that South African prisons were poorly-equipped for disabled people and Pistorius could catch a variety of diseases including Aids and tuberculosis

The court was told that prison would 'break' Pistorius and rob him of a future

As the judge heard mitigating factors in the athlete's sentencing, Annette Vergeer, a probation officer called by Mr Pistorius's defence team, described the dangers of drugs, gangs and sodomy in the country's prisons.

She also said they were poorly-equipped for disabled people and warned of the risks of transmission of Aids, tuberculosis and other diseases, The Telegraph reported.

The court was told prison would 'break' Pistorius and rob him of a future. She also suggested there was a chance he could be raped. 

Her claims were backed-up by Amnesty International and Justice Project reports which last year exposed alleged torture and other abuse at a state prison in Bloemfontein. 

Pistorius, 27, was convicted last month of the manslaughter of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp

The department rejected the accusations which they said were 'inaccurate' and sought to 'cast doubt on the state of our correctional centres'.

The department's statement read: 'The reports seek to create an impression that our centres are fraught with, among other things, unhygienic conditions, gang violence and sodomy or rape. 

'Such allegations about the conditions in our centres are inaccurate.'
