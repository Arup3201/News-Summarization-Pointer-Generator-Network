Glenn Cooper was asked to apply for a special license to allow his guests to stand up and drink free alcohol at his own brewery for his retirement party.

Mr Cooper, who is an executive chairman at Coopers Brewery in Regency Park of South Australia, said following the bureaucratic madness, it has made it difficult for businesses.

His company had already received approval but he was required to apply for another license to be able to host people in ‘a fenced off area where people can stand up’ and drink alcohol outside.

It's reported that in South Australia, people are 'not allowed to stand up and drink alcohol in outdoor areas'

'This is because in South Australia you are not allowed to stand up and drink alcohol in outdoor areas,' Mr Cooper told Adelaide Now.

‘In Melbourne and Sydney, they have sectioned off areas where you can have a drink.

‘We’re the only state in Australia where that happens. It causes a lot of frustration for people.'

Mr Cooper also added that his children had travelled interstate and when they returned home, they said 'boy we’re a bit of a nanny state because of these rules'.

The regulation follows after treasurer Joe Hockey addressed his frustration in parliament on Wednesday over a red tape experience he encountered at a pizza restaurant with his family.

'I went to put the two tables together and the owner of the pizza shop came out and said 'I'm sorry Mr Hockey, you're not allowed to do that, the council regulation prevents you putting the two tables together', he told an audience in Canberra.

'There were eight of us, so I went inside to get another chair and they said, 'Sorry Mr Hockey, they've said you can only have seven chairs [outside], not eight'.'

'That’s when I exploded. I actually tracked down the local mayor and I think the whole suburb heard the conversation.

'When excessive red tape lowers productivity it ultimately lowers growth and the standard of living for all Australians.'

The federal government held its' second 'red tape repeal day' on Wednesday.

The government has a plan to cut $1 billion in red tape every year, with two parliamentary repeal days each year to cut unnecessary and costly legislation and regulation.

'The 2014 Spring Repeal Day will repeal nearly 1,000 pieces and more than 7,200 pages of legislation and regulation,' the Government website said.

'This is in addition to the 2014 Autumn Repeal Day, which repealed over 10,000 pieces and 50,000 pages of legislation and regulation. This brings the total net deregulatory savings to date to over $2.1 billion.'

This year, Australia ranked 124 out of 148 countries for ‘burden of government regulation’, according to the World Economic Forum Global Competitiveness Index.
