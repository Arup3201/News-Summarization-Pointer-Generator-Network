France is offering to pay local fisherman to cull sharks in the waters of its Indian Ocean isle Reunion.

The nation's government is controversially pressing ahead with the plans despite a wave of protest from conservation groups.

It is in response to a spike in deadly bull shark attacks on surfers and swimmers off the coast of the paradise island, the most recent being just last week.

Fears: There are 40 different species of shark which frequent waters off Réunion Island, 10 of them are potentially dangerous and two - the bull shark (pictured) and great white - deadly

Animal rights groups are criticizing the culling plans, calling it 'extermination'.

The local government has called the payments as unprecedented for the French-administered island and necessary to encourage shark killings. 

Fearsome: Both male and female bull sharks have the most testosterone of any animal on the planet

Paradise isle: Tens of thousands of tourists travel to Reunion Island every year in search of tropical sun, white sands and glistening seas

The amount being offered is still being decided upon, but the money would likely be paid out per kilo of shark meat.

From 2000-2010 there were no shark attacks in the area and no need for culling.

Bull sharks, or Carcharhinus leucas, are the Reunion’s top predator and, like other species, females tend to be larger than males.

Both male and female bull sharks have the most testosterone of any animal on the planet.

Like great white sharks and tiger 
sharks they have serrated teeth which allow them to tear apart their 
meals and go after bigger prey.

Bull sharks also like to swim in shallow, coastal waters and are unusual in their ability to survive in freshwater.

They are typically solitary hunters, but occasionally hunt in pairs.

They can accelerate rapidly and can be highly aggressive, particularly towards animals animals that enter their territory.

A bull shark's diet consists mainly of bony fish and sharks, including other bull sharks, but can also include turtles, birds, dolphins, land mammals.

Last week's tragedy, in which 22-year-old Alexandre Rassica died after a shark bit off his leg, was the seventh attack -
and the third fatality - since the start of 2011.

In November last year, an experienced French surfer was killed by a shark in an horrific attack off the coast of Reunion.

Friends
of Matthieu Schiller, the 32-year-old manager of a surf school and a 
former bodyboard champion, say the beast circled him before moving in 
with 'terrifying' speed.

In August 2011, British man Ian Redmond, 30, was attacked and killed by a shark in the nearby Seychelles.

According to experts there are 40 
different species of shark which frequent waters off Réunion Island, 10 
of them are potentially dangerous and two - the bull shark and great 
white - deadly.
