Adnan el Shukrijumah, chief of global operations for Al-Qaeda, was killed in a raid by Pakistani military

The Pakistani military says they've killed a senior an Al-Qaeda leader who grew up in the United States and was on the FBI's most wanted list. 

Adnan el Shukrijumah, 39, was the chief of global operations for the terrorist group. He was killed along with two other suspected militants in Shinwarsak, South Waziristan,on Saturday. 

Shukrijumah, who lived in New York and Florida for 15 years, was accused of plotting to blow up the New York City subway. He also planned attacks on the London Underground and trains in Norway.

Federal prosecutors say he recruited three men in 2008 to receive training in the lawless tribal region of Pakistan for carrying out attacks.

He eventually took over a position once held by Khalid Sheikh Mohammed —  the mastermind of the Sept. 11 World Trade Center attacks — who was captured in 2003.

Shukrijumah was found hiding in a compound after fleeing from a  North Waziristan tribal district where the army launched a major operation against militant bases in June.

'The al-Qaida leader, who was killed by the Pakistan army in a successful operation, is the same person who had been indicted in the United Stated,' said a senior Pakistani army officer.

Pakistan military spokesman Major General Asim Bajwa said in a tweet that five terrorists were also arrested during the raid. 

Shukrijumah was born in Saudi Arabia and moved to the US as young child.

He settled with his family in Brooklyn, New York, where his father preached in a mosque.

The family moved to Florida, where he took classes at a community college and worked odd jobs. 

But when the FBI showed up to arrest him as a material witness to a terrorism case in 2003, he already had left the country. 

He lived in the US for 15 years but rose to a prominent position in Al-Qaeda and took over a position once held by the mastermind of the September 11 World Trade Center attacks

Prosecutors believe he visited Trinidad and London on his way to al-Qaeda camps in Afghanistan where he started with lowly camp duties.

He was moved up the FBI's most wanted list — including a $5 million bounty on his head — when three men accused of plotting suicide bomb attacks on New York's subway system named him as their key liaison in Pakistan.
