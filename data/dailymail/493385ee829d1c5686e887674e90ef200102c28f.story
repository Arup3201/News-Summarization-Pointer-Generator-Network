Ukip leader Nigel Farage defended himself against allegations of sexism

Nigel Farage today insisted that ‘no one has done more’ than him
to promote women as he tried to shake off claims his party was sexist.

The Ukip leader said women were ‘slowly but surely taking
over’ his party – and that after the European elections there will be as many
high-profile Ukip women as men.

He said this had been achieved despite the party not
engaging in positive discrimination; a policy which he described as
‘demeaning’.

Mr Farage also said the country needed an ‘honest debate’
about our maternity laws which he said were placing a huge burden on small
businesses.

He was interviewed on BBC Radio 4’s Woman’s Hour a day after
Ukip came second in the Wythenshawe and Sale East by election – pushing the
Conservatives into third place.

Critics say the party has an image problem with women
because of comments by senior figures such as Godfrey Bloom, who described
women as ‘sluts’ last autumn.

In addition, most of the party’s top team are male, but Mr
Farage insisted that was changing.

‘Ukip in the early days was very male dominated, and also
amongst the voters far more men voted for us than women,’ he said.

‘We saw a change in that begin to happen last year. I think
the reason for that was the three big by-election advances that we made –
Corby, Rotherham, Eastleigh – all female candidates. 

‘We’ve just completed our selections for the European
elections and the women have done amazingly well. In fact there are some saying
that women are about to take Ukip over.

‘From May 22 this year, post the European elections, there
are going to be, among our top line people, as many women as men – and that’s
not happened with positive discrimination, it’s happened because our members
have judged they are the right people.’

He praised Thatcherism its belief in meritocracy on gender
and class; contrasting it with Labour and the Tories’ belief in positive
discrimination.

‘There’s a huge debate in politics,’ he said. ‘Is positive
discrimination the way forward? Or do we just say: We don’t care whether people
are black or white, male or female – we let them get on according to their
ability. That’s the view that we’ve taken in UKIP.

‘That is going to be at forefront of the national debate for
years to come, because we have European rules on the percentage of women that
have to be in the boardroom.

‘So we’re moving down the road of positive discrimination to
create a fairer society and I’m not sure it works.’

Mrl Farage, pictured meeting locals on the flooded Somerset Levels, warned that positive discrimination towards women is 'demeaning'

Pointing out that Ukip women often appear on Question Time,
he added:  ‘The women are slowly but surely taking over Ukip, they’re
going to dominate the election coverage. We believe in a meritocracy, we think
that positive discrimination is demeaning.’

Mr Farage was asked about comments by former Ukip member
Marta Andreasen that: ‘Nigel does not like women… He thinks women should be in
the kitchen or in the bedroom.’

He replied: ‘Nobody but nobody has taken that seriously
because they all know it’s not true. Nobody has done more to promote women in
UKIP than I’ve done, not through positive discrimination.

‘When people get kicked out of political parties they tend
to be very bitter and very upset and say all sorts of things. But she got it
wrong and that’s why it’s never stuck.’

The MEP said: ‘When you get the results from the European
elections, you’ll be astonished to see as many women as men in the top slots in
UKIP – things have changed.’

UKIP has been campaigning this week for Britain’s foreign
aid budget to be diverted towards flood relief in southern England.

Mr Farage told Woman’s Hour that the policy is playing
better with women than men, ‘because I think that women actually do tend to be
people that think very much about the family, and about budgets – men tend to
be rather more irresponsible on these issues in many households.’

He defended his comments that women who have children are
‘worth less’ to their City employers, saying he was only talking about the
financial sector.

‘If a woman is a doctor, a dentist, a lawyer, then having
time off to have children makes absolutely no difference to her career
advancement at all,’ he said.

Ukip has been dogged by allegations of sexism since former Godfrey Bloom, who later quit, described a roomful of female supporters as 'sluts'

But he said maternity laws put too much burden on small
businesses.

‘That is something we’ve got to talk about and debate
honestly,’ he said. ‘On the one hand we want women to have every opportunity to
go into the workplace, but on the other we have to allow our small businesses
to survive.’

Mr Farage also defended former UKIP member Godfrey Bloom,
who said an employer would have to have their ‘head examined’ if they wanted to
employ a woman of childbearing age.

He said that the likes of Alan Sugar and India Knight agreed
with the comments, which were worded badly.

‘What he was saying was legislation that was put in place to
protect women in the workplace is now in a sense discriminating against them
getting a job in the first place,’ he said.

‘A lot of people now agree that the essence of what he said
was right, but the way he expressed it perhaps upset people.’
