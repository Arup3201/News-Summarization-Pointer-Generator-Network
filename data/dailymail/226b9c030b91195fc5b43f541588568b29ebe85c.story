British business tycoon Peter Jones's attempts to launch a TV career in the U.S. are already being ridiculed after a trailer for his forthcoming show sees him driving around in a car with the license plate 'SOB'.

Jones, who shot to fame in the UK as a judge on Dragons' Den - similar to the U.S. programme Shark Tank -Â  is currently being splashed across American TV screens to promote his show Save Our Business.

However producers have given the entrepreneur a car to drive into shot featuring the registration plate 'SOB' - an abbreviation for 'Son Of A B***h'.

It has prompted many fans to laugh at the teaser trailers on the TNT Network. One viewer Sheree Johnson, from Los Angeles, admitted: 'The trailer is hilarious.

'He is presented as a tough talking 
businessman who takes no nonsense and yet he drives around with a car 
which a license plate of SOB - it's hysterical.

'I am not sure if he is trying to care himself out as a hated figure, but I don't think that is what producers want. - this is just stupid.'

Another viewer Kris Deutsch, also from LA, said: 'The trailer presents him as a SOB. What a ridiculous way to introduce him to people.

'He is meant to be a respected businessman. This is a real blooper.

'Surely someone at the network must have realized that.'

The show begins on TNT later this month.

A spokesman said: 'Peter Jones is a titan of entrepreneurship who has created a worldwide empire with more than a hundred businesses, both large and small.

'In TNT's Save Our Business, Jones travels across America on a mission -- investing his time and expertise and putting his reputation on the line to save small businesses in trouble.

'Each week, Jones will assess the major problems facing a struggling company and design a plan to help save it from collapsing.

'During the first season of Save Our Business, Jones will lend his expertise and tough-love guidance to an online retailer of 'vintage inspired' woman's clothing, an indoor kids theme park, a karate school, a combination florist/wine store and a New York City bagel deli'.
