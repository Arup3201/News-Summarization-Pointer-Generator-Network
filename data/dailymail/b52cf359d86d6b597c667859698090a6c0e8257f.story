Britain faces being dragged further into the crisis in Iraq after Nato revealed it would consider intervening if the country asked.

Anders Fogh Rasmussen, the Nato Secretary General, said Iraq was an ally and any request for military assistance would be looked at ‘constructively’.

He said: ‘Nato has a partnership with Iraq and if there is a request for further enhancement of that partnership, I think Nato allies would consider such a request constructively.’

Mr Rasmussen added: ‘The international community has a responsibility to stop the advance of the so-called Islamic state.’

Mr Ramussen’s remarks, which came after he praised US bombing raids on ISIS fighters and the reconnaissance effort of British forces – raises the prospect of Britain being dragged into the crisis through the commitment to Nato.

Nato decisions on whether to launch military action require consent from all member states, meaning Britain would not be committed against its will.

Mr Rasmussen also hinted that France should scrap its shipment of arms to the Russian government over the Kremlin’s continued interference in eastern Ukraine.

He said the French government should listen to Nato allies that have criticised the sale of £1 billion Mistral-class warships to Russia.

David Cameron has said the deal would be ‘unthinkable’ in the wake of Russian aggression in eastern Ukraine.

But Mr Rasmussen said: ‘I'm not going to interfere with a national French decision.’

‘That's not for Nato - it's a bilateral arrangement between France and Russia but I have full confidence the French government will take its decisions taking into account concerns raised by other allies and taking into account the overall security situation in Europe.’
