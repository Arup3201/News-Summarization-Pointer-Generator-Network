Ronan Farrow has been awarded a journalism award, even though he has anchored just three broadcasts

Ronan Farrow, the news anchor with a grand total of three hours of daytime television, has received a prestigious journalism award.

Yesterday the 26-year-old was handed The Cronkite Award for Excellence in Exploration and Journalism at a ceremony in New York.

The honour is named for renowned American journalist Walter Cronkite, who presented the first award in 1984.

Giving such a prestigious accolade to Mr Farrow has raised eyebrows, not least with the man himself.

He tweeted: 'Maybe I can earn a Cronkite award by investigating how long it'll take me to actually live up to a Cronkite award.'

Before the event, organisers Reach The World banned reporters from asking 'off-topic' questions - to ensure that Farrow will not have to comment on the controversy surrounding whether his father was Woody Allen or Frank Sinatra.

The organisation even threatened to throw out anyone who broke the rule.

'The theme of the evening is global education and service,' a memo to the press read, reports Politico.

'All press are required to stay strictly on message. Any press who ask guests or Mr. Farrow about off-message topics will be immediately escorted out of the event.'

MSNBC denied that the diktat came from Farrow's team. A statement to the New York Post read: 'Ronan and his team did not request any restrictions on reporters' questions.'

Farrow later tweeted: 'I’d never demand anyone not ask me anything, obviously. (Doesn’t mean I have to answer though.)'

Farrow tweeted a tongue in cheek response to receiving the accolade

Things looked more positive in February for Farrow when he won a coveted journalism award

Despite little prior experience, MSNBC had high hopes that Farrow will help them attract millennial viewers, something which hasn't happened so far

Earlier this month Woody Allen wrote that Ronan, his son, could have been fathered by Frank Sinatra and claimed that mother Mia Farrow may have been lying about it for decades.

The Annie Hall director said Ronan, his only biological child with Farrow, ‘looks a lot like Frank’ thanks to his blue eyes and similar facial features.

Allen said that if it were true then Farrow would have kept a dark secret during their bitter custody battle 21 years ago to make him pay child support.

Allen’s claims were in response to an article in Vanity Fair magazine in which Farrow said that Sinatra was ‘possibly’ Ronan’s father.

Writing in the New York Times, he also for the first time publicly addressed allegations he abused his adopted daughter Dylan and called them ‘ludicrous’.

Woody Allen has questioned whether Ronan Farrow is his biological son. There is speculation that Frank Sinatra is his real father
