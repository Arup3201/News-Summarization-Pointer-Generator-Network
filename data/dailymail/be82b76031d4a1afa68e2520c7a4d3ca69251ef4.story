West Ham are hoping for a breakthrough in talks with Nice over left-back Timothee Kolodziejczak.

The 22-year-old has been trailed by Southampton and QPR but is keen on West Ham and they hope to conclude a deal for around £3m.

Kolodziejczak has represented France at every youth level up to U-20s, and has played over 70 games for Nice in the past two seasons.

West Ham are also considering Colombia defender Eder Balanta, 21, who plays for Argentinian side River Plate.
