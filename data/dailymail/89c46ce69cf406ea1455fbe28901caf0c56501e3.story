Judge said they saw elderly as 'easy meat' and left victims traumatised

This is the moment rogue traders ransacked a pensioner's roof before charging him ten times what they first quoted for damage following last year's winter storms.

The 68-year-old was originally told he would have to pay £25 after a few tiles slipped off his roof in high winds in February 2013.

But conmen John and Michael O'Brien, who were jailed this week for targeting the elderly in a series of building scams, later told him it would cost £248 after they removed even more of his roof.

The gang took advantage of storm damage to get on to the man's roof, then demanded ten times the amount of money after removing more tiles themselves

Luckily, the quick-thinking pensioner took photographs of the men and alerted police to their activities.

The shocking case was just one of a number of scams carried out by the pair, Cardiff Crown Court heard this week.

The first victim targeted was a 70-year-old man living alone in Bridgend, south Wales, who was told a £410 garage door he had ordered was being delivered.

Prosecutor Matthew Cobbe told the court: 'He hadn't ordered anything and told him to go away but his door was knocked for the next hour.'

Despite the victim turning out his lights in the hope the men would leave, they eventually persuaded him to pay £446, the court heard.

Mr Cobbe said: 'Over the next week there were repeated requests for money and several visits to his HSBC bank.

'Two men phoned him, keeping up the pressure. On Monday he withdrew £200 then £300 on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday.

'By now he had handed over £1,550 but bank staff called police, concerned about the withdrawals and the male (Michael O'Brien) who was with the pensioner.

'The old door of his garage had been removed by the defendant, work an expert later valued at £50.'

The victim was left angry, upset and embarrassed by what happened, the court heard.

CCTV footage showed how the conmen even went to their victims' banks in a bid to get more money from them

In the following weeks, a 58-year-old woman was told she needed new uPVC on the front of her house, which could be done for £350.

Despite telling John O'Brien she couldn't afford it, he began dismantling the exterior of her home, 'stripping it to the asbestos', the court heard.

She was later convinced to hand over another £700 before she was told there was a problem in her loft which would cost £1,800.

After she alerted her ex-husband to what was going on, the workmen disappeared, the court heard.

The rogue traders left their victims' homes in disarray, but also left their fingerprints on a paint tin

Mr Cobbe said: 'They never came back but she had to 
call in builders to put right the guttering and fascia. She was left 
feeling so vulnerable that she took the overdose.'

Days later, a 67-year-old who walks with a stick was followed to her Cardiff home by two men who offered to paint it for £40.

She agreed, but was later asked for a further £1,200.

Mr Cobbe told the judge: 'It is clear she did not know what she was paying for and having taken £1,200 from her, they then turned their attention to the house itself.

'She described John O'Brien as being determined to take down her kitchen ceiling, telling her she had a water leak, then saying there would be a lot of rubbish to take away and charging her another £2,400.

'When she said she didn't have it, on his suggestion she took out a loan from her bank but having then paid £3,600 he said he needed £3,000 more, which the bank refused to give her because her only income was a small pension.'

The woman's home was left with no ceiling and debris all over her kitchen, the court heard.

Michael O'Brien, 21, who had no previous convictions, admitted defrauding four victims and John O'Brien, 34, who had a list of 46 previous offences, accepted he had cheated three.

John O'Brien, of Whitaker Road, Splott, Cardiff, was jailed for 38 months and Michael O'Brien, of Seagar Drive, Cardiff Bay, was given 30 months.

Judge Philip Richards told them: 'In your language they were easy meat but serious psychological harm was done.'

Peter Harding-Roberts, for father-of-four John O'Brien, said he disputed being part of a big organised gang but accepted he had taken up the offer to make some money.

Mr Harding-Roberts told the court that O'Brien's guilty pleas showed he was remorseful.

But the judge said: 'You would think that the first time he saw the distress on a victim's face, that would have produced remorse... but he just went on and on.'
