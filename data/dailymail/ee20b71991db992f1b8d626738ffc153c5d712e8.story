It can be a tricky and quite daunting moment for any dignitary or celebrity visiting New Zealand for the first time - the traditional Maori welcome known as 'hongi' - and German Chancellor Angela Merkel seemed decidedly uneasy when told what she was about to do.

On Friday morning at Government House in Auckland, the German leader was treated to the 'haka' war cry by Maori warriors, she then engaged in the 'hongi' and was honoured with a 19-gun salute.

At first she was challenged to a 'wero' by the warriors but it's her reaction when it appears she's being told by Maori elder Lewis Moeau about undertaking the nose-to-nose greeting, which is priceless.

You want me to do what? German Chancellor Angela Merkel listens intently to advice from Maori elder Lewis Moeau at Government House as the moment to hongi with a Maori warrior fast approaches

Here goes. Despite looking daunted by the prospect of touching noses, the German Chancellor seemed to make a good fist of the hongi tradition

The hongi is an ancient tradition which is believed to be based on the breathing of life (into the nostrils) of the first woman by a God, considered the creator of life by the Maori culture.

In a full ceremonial morning at Government House, Chancellor Merkel was privy to the haka and the challenge known as wero.

There was also a navy guard of honour and 19-gun salute.

The German leader is among several heading into Brisbane on Friday.

The high-profile landings include dignitaries from South Korea, India, Indonesia, Canada and Japan.

A special high-security area at the Brisbane international terminal will also host Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott and British PM David Cameron, who have held a joint news conference in Canberra ahead of the summit.

The arrivals and ensuing motorcades are likely to disrupt traffic for motorists in the Brisbane area as leaders are taken to their hotels amid a heavy police presence.

In the evening, Angela Merkel is expected to be followed in by Spanish President Mariano Rajoy Brey and Chinese leader Xi Jinping.

One of the last arrivals will be Russian President Vladimir Putin.

US President Barack Obama is expected to arrive on Saturday.
