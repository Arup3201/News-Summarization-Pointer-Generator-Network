The widow of a man James 'Whitey' Bulger is accused of luring to his death told the court today of the moment she bravely confronted the gangster about her husband's disappearance 38 years ago.

Margaret King, 68, said she courageously marched up to Bulger as he was getting into his car outside Triple O's bar in South Boston demanding to know where her husband Tommy King was.

'I wanted more information,' King said of the day in November 1975 she stormed the Winter Hill 
hangout.

'I'm sure he was agitated that I would 
bother him,'

She said remembered a snarling Bulger saying to her: 'He's probably in Canada robbing banks, because that's what he originally wanted to do.'

Boston police had knocked on her door on November 6 looking for her husband of eight years, according to the Boston Herald. 

They told her the body of Francis 'Buddy' Leonard, his friend, had been found in his car and they wanted to search the house.

King, a post partum nurse, testified her husband and Leonard had 'grown up together' and she knew of no reason for Tommy King to kill him.

Tommy King's bones were unearthed near the Neponset River in Dorchester in 2000.

His widow said he was identified through his brother’s DNA and that she has always believed Bulger murdered her husband, an associate of the mobster.

Prosecutors today said that Bulger had killed King by luring him into a car where he was shot by hitman John Martorano.

Martorano testified last week that he had shot and killed King because Bulger had ordered it.

'Him and Tommy couldn't get along. They were always butting heads together,' Martorano told the court.

'He wanted to get rid of Tommy.'

To
get rid of Tommy King, the Winter Hill Gang asked him to accompany them on a drive-by hit, 
Martorano testified, according to ABC News.

Mobsters in the car handed King, who they convinced to get into the passenger seat of the car, an unloaded gun before Martorano shot him in the head.

Bulger, 83, is on trial for a string of crimes, including 19 murders, extortion, money laundering and gun stockpiling. He was arrested two years ago after 16 years on the run.

He has pleaded not guilty.

The trial so far has featured former mobsters, retired law enforcement members and family members of alleged Bulger victims, including Francis 'Buddy' Leonard's brother Joseph.

Sandra Castucci, the widow of murdered Revere nightclub owner Richard Castucci who was in debt to the mafia, also testified today.

A crying Castucci described for the court a photo of her late husband with Frank Sinatra taken when they attended the wedding of Sammy Davis Jr.

Castucci received about $2 million after suing the federal government, blaming the FBI’s mishandling of Bulger as an informant for her husband's death, according to the Boston Herald.

In other developments today, Boston Globe reports Bulger fed the FBI information for 15 year about everyone from New York Mafia don John Gotti to some of his closest South Boston associates.
