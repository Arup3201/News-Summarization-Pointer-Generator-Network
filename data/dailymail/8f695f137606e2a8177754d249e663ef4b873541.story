For most managers, losing your captain for three vital games - two against direct rivals - would be a disaster.

But such is the embarrassment of attacking riches at Louis van Gaal's disposal, he must now choose between a £37million World Cup winner and arguably one of the best young players in Europe to replace the suspended Wayne Rooney. 

Van Gaal no doubt would prefer to have Rooney available for Sunday's clash with Everton but as far as replacements go Juan Mata and Adnan Januzaj aren't too bad.

Most managers would love to have such options, but who will the Dutchman choose? And what will it tell us about his long-term plans for Manchester United?

The Dutchman has already proven during his short tenure at Old Trafford that he is not to be second guessed when it comes to team selection. He has, after all, used more players this year than any other manager and given debuts to several young players barely known outside the walls of United's Carrington training ground.

But Mata, having scored twice this season already, may consider himself a slight favourite over his younger rival, who is yet to start a game in any competition this season. 

Van Gaal hinted as much during his Friday press conference, saying: 'In [Rooney's] position Juan Mata has played very well. I have to choose. I will miss Wayne because he is the captain of the team but Mata can also play very well.'

That being said, however, the 26-year-old has been on the bench for United's last two games - and didn't even come on during the 2-1 win over West Ham last week.

With Robin van Persie and Radamel Falcao - neither of whom are blessed with much pace - to start up front, Van Gaal may decide that he wants more speed and dynamism in his front three - meaning Mata may be sacrificed. 

For all his talent on the ball and ability to open up defences, there is no doubt that Mata often slows United's play down. Januzaj, however, is one of those players who has the ability to get fans out of their seats with his direct style of play. 

Under former manager David Moyes, the 19-year-old was predominately seen terrorising opposition full-backs but many at Old Trafford believe that he will eventually develop in to the No 10 role. 

Van Gaal has used Januzaj sparingly this season but after he shone for United's U21s last week - scoring one and setting the other up - the Dutchman may feel he can no longer keep his No 11 on the bench. 

In recent years, United have lost many of their promising young stars - Paul Pogba, Ravel Morrison and Gerard Pique in particular - and that may too play a part in Van Gaal's thinking.

He must surely know that the longer he keeps Januzaj on the fringes of the first-team, the greater the chance he will leave. 

The Belgian was one of the few players to emerge with any credit last season during Moyes' disastrous reign and it was expected that this would be the year he really broke through and showed his full potential. 

However, a change in formation and the arrival of a flurry of expensive stars at Old Trafford have raised doubts about the future of Januzaj. Is he prepared to bide his time or will he look to move elsewhere in search of the game time a young player of his calibre no doubt deserves? 

Equally, should Mata find himself on the bench on Sunday, then it would surely signal the start of the end for him at United. If Mata isn't trusted in a home game against Everton, then when will he be trusted? 

It is a straight shoot-out between two talented - but different - players and whoever gets the nod will be under pressure to deliver. But who will Van Gaal choose, we will find out soon enough...
