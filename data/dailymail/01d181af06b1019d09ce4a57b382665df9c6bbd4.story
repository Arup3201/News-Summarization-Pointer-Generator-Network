Sebastian Vettel has knocked back an invitation from Nico Rosberg to visit the Mercedes garage this weekend, fearing a PR stunt.

Ferrari star Vettel and Mercedes ace Nico Rosberg became involved in a spat during the post-Australian Grand Prix press conference.

It resulted in Vettel suggesting Mercedes should open up their garage at the Sepang International Circuit for an inspection of their cars in the wake of a dominant display at Melbourne's Albert Park.

Vettel branded Rosberg's invitation to visit the Mercedes garage in Malaysia as 'staged' and a 'PR stunt' 

Rosberg then invited Vettel, with the latter suggesting the debrief in the engineers' room for his visit.

Now, however, such a plan has been knocked down as Vettel said: 'When I was joking with Nico in the press conference the deal was the invite was for all the paddock. Now it seems the invite has shrunk to just me.

'Initially I think it was called off by Niki (Lauda, Mercedes non-executive director) and Toto (Wolff, Mercedes motorsport boss).

Rosberg finished second behind race-winner Lewis Hamilton at the season-opening Australian Grand Prix 

'Now they've told (Rosberg) yes, so I think they are using it as a bit more of a PR thing rather than a proper invite, so the answer is no I won't be going.'

Asked as to whether it was his decision or that of Ferrari, he said: 'It wasn't really discussed to be honest.

'Initially it was called off and then I think they tried to use it as "Ah yeah, we are so friendly and open to everyone".

'Even if I went there, do you think they would really open up? That means I won't go, because even if I go it's all staged.'
