A rescue home cat has finally found loving owners after people were put off by his Dracula-like fangs.

Timmy, a nine-year-old black cat, has an enormous pair of front teeth which stick out of his mouth like a vampire.

The nine-year-old moggy was taken into the Blue Cross rehoming centre in Lewknor, Oxfordshire, around three months ago. 

Vampire cat: Timmy's Dracula-like fangs put off prospective owners for months but he has finally found a home

There were fears he might never find a home because of his bloodthirsty look, with most cats finding owners within a month. 

But 'affectionate' and 'loving' Timmy has finally been taken in by cat-lover Ann Drummond.

She said: 'We saw him on the Blue Cross website and thought he looked and sounded great.

'His fangs didn’t put us off at all - he’s the sweetest, friendliest cat.

'Our previous cat had one fang so he reminded us of her. Timmy’s such a character and we love him to bits.' 

Black cats are notoriously difficult to rehome thanks to myths and superstition that they bring bad luck.

Timmy was facing the prospect of a lonely existence, having been returned to Blue Cross at no fault of his own on four separate occasions.

Nicola Rixson, from the Blue Cross rehoming centre, said: 'It is very unusual for cats to have such prominent front teeth - in Timmy’s case it looks like he has fangs.

'Timmy got lots of attention while he was with us because of his unusual appearance, and we were worried it would put people off giving him a home.

'Luckily his wait paid off and he’s found a great family who adore him.'

Lisa Kent, animal welfare assistant at Blue Cross, added: 'The only supernatural powers Timmy possesses are ones of unconditional love and affection, just like any other cat.

'Despite the similarity to the vampire villain, Timmy is a friendly chap and we’re delighted that he has become part of a family again.”
