For 88 minutes on Sunday evening, there may have been something uncomfortably familiar about this Holland performance for the watching Manchester United supporters.

Shorn of ideas and deprived of pace, Louis van Gaal’s team increasingly resorted to high and speculative balls forward. Whisper it quietly, but this rather felt as though we were watching the Manchester United of the David Moyes incarnation all over again.

The similarities even extended to Robin van Persie, Van Gaal’s most trusted on-field lieutenant, failing to show. On this occasion, though, one imagines that the Dutchman did not have a statement prepared for the post-match mixed zone alleging that his team-mates are ‘often playing in my zones’, as he did after Manchester United’s dreadful 2-0 defeat by Olympiacos. Under Van Gaal, he simply would not dare.

Nonetheless, in the searing heart, Holland seemed rudderless and leaderless. The midfield bulldog Nigel De Jong had succumbed to injury. Captain Van Persie had been hooked with fifteen minutes to go.

For all intents and purposes, this Holland team looked finished. Over 4,000 miles away at Carington, they may have been dusting down the black leather chair in the manager’s office to prepare for Van Gaal’s arrival.

And then it happened, inexplicably and unpredictably. Maybe we should have known better. After all, Holland have won three of their four games in this World Cup having trailed at some point in the game. Spain, Australia and now Mexico have all fallen under an illusion of comfort, only to be brutally struck down.

In Manchester, a wry smile may have curled on to the faces of those who make the weekly pilgrimage to Old Trafford. They have seen teams with this kind of spirit before. Holland’s mettle was impressive, their refusal to go quietly from this magnificent World Cup admirable. Fergie-time may have competition.

Throw in an injury-time penalty strewn with controversy and there’s a peculiar sense of deja-vu.

Louis van Gaal’s similarities with Sir Alex Ferguson would appear to go beyond an authoritative discipline and an aversion to speaking openly with the Press.

The best managers inspire incomparable loyalty, the kind that sees substitutes such as Klass-Jan Huntelaar, who had not played a single minute so far at this World Cup, emerge from the bench to win the football match almost single-handedly, creating one for Wesley Sneijder and then scoring the winning strike from the penalty spot.

In Salford parlance, they  know it as doing a ‘Teddy Sheringham’, remembering the forward’s contribution on that evening in the Nou Camp in 1999.

Bold move: Van Gaal took off Van Persie and the move worked as Holland came back to win

They will recognise, also, the courage to make the unpopular decision. How would Van Persie have reacted to his manager if Holland failed to win following his substitution?

What would be the repercussions as Van Gaal begins his Manchester United career? Frankly, Van Gaal showed little regard. His mind was made up. Egos will not be indulged when the success of the team is at stake. If only Moyes had displayed such courage in his convictions.

One gloomy Saturday afternoon in December immediately sprang to mind on Sunday evening, when Manchester United were defeated 1-0 by Newcastle. Van Persie was evidently off-the-pace, his performance justifying a change. Moyes feared the consequences, stating: ‘I think if I’d brought him off some people would say ‘What are you doing? You are 1-0 down and you’re taking off your top goalscorer.’

The Glaswegian never could discover the key to that magic box of comebacks at Old Trafford, his players disaffected and uncommitted as the clock ticked down on his traumatic reign. The Champions he inherited became timid lambs, trading in domestic domination for a startling neurosis.

After Sir Alex Ferguson’s 27 years in the managerial chair, we assumed that United players were on auto-pilot, that those qualities of utter determination, self-sacrifice and loyalty to the shirt were self-perpetuating. For nine months, it all dissipated.

Alls well that ends well: Van Persie applauds the fans at the end after Holland progressed

Under Moyes, United recovered to win after falling behind on just four occasions out of twenty. The season before, United had reversed deficits to win eleven times before Boxing Day alone.

Manchester United supporters may have felt those breathless moments were now confined to the DVD’s of the glorious yesteryears.

Van Gaal’s stirring crescendo on the grandest stage will assure the rank-and-file that there will be many more of those epic times to come.
