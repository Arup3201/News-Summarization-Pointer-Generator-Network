He may never have been destined for the dinner table, but that doesn’t make Bernard’s story of survival any less remarkable.

For this pet turkey, it was a greedy fox rather than a hungry human that sparked a chain of events that would put his life in jeopardy.

Bernard went missing for ten days after being snatched by the fox, leaving owner Ellie Waite, 32, fearing the worst.

Reunited: Bernard and his owner Ellie Waite, 32, after the turkey went through his death-defying journey

Mrs Waite, 32, and her son Ben, ten, found a trail of blood and feathers in their garden at East Ruston near North Walsham, Norfolk.

Her husband Russell, 39, searched nearby fields and hedgerows in vain for Bernard, a Norfolk black turkey weighing 15lbs, before giving him up for dead.

But unknown to them, Bernard had escaped from the fox and turned up battered on the doorstep of a woman who lives half a mile away.

She fed him corn and table scraps and let him sleep in her garage at night until she returned from work four days later to find he had wandered off from her garden.

Bernard was strutting around on his own when he was attacked again by a border terrier which was out for a walk.

The male owner of the dog managed to prise Bernard free from his dog's jaws and took his pet home.

He then returned to pick up Bernard and took him to a friend who lives five miles away in Happisburgh, so she could look after him as she already had ducks and chickens.

Meanwhile Mrs Waite heard from other her next door neighbour how Bernard was being looked after by the woman who lives half a mile away from her.

But when she tracked her down, she found out that he had gone.

Mrs Waite said 'The lovely lady had been caring for him, putting him in her garage at night and letting him in her garden during the day.

'But when she returned from work one evening Bernard had gone without a trace. My heart sank, I was too late.'

Mrs Waite then launched a Facebook campaign to try and find Bernard her pet led her to the family in Happisburgh just two hours later.

She said: 'To my utter amazement I got a message from someone who had seen my cry for help. She said: "I think I have got your turkey here."

'After nearly falling through the floor I made contact with the lady who was actually in Happisburgh, about five miles away.

'He is now back safely with us after his amazing adventure. He must be the luckiest turkey in the world.

'He is fortunate enough to be a much-loved pet at a time when millions of other turkeys end up being eaten for Christmas.

'But then he also survived being snatched by a fox and attacked by a dog. He is just indestructible.'

Mrs Waite who runs Springfield dog kennels with her husband in East Ruston said that Bernard had been roosting seven feet up a tree in her garden when he was grabbed by the fox.

She said: 'I thought he was safe in his tree, but somehow this fox nabbed him. It looked liked a fox was claiming his Christmas lunch early.

'We knew it had to be a fox because of all the feathers and the blood that we found in the garden the next morning.

'We looked around but found no sign of him so we thought it was certain that he had been taken away and eaten.

'We also heard that a fox had taken one of our neighbour's chickens. It was horrendous - we were in mourning.

'Apparently when he turned up on this woman's doorstep, he had a bad cut on his breast and his wing was bleeding, so somehow he must have fought back against the fox and got away.

'When we got him back, he had also lost a lot of flight feathers and had a scar under his wing. We do not know how much damage was done by the fox and how much by the dog.

'His wounds are healing up nicely now, but he cannot fly at the moment because his feathers are missing which I suppose is quite a good thing.

'It means he cannot get back into his tree to roost so we are locking him up at night with our ducks in our children's wendy house so he is safe.'

Mrs Waite added: 'When he was missing, my father was telling me that there was no way we would get him back as anyone who found him would keep him for a free Christmas dinner.

'He is such a character and it is great to have him back. He is part of the family and loves playing with our four dogs.

'He watches us eat through the conservatory window so there's no way I could eat turkey with him watching.

'We'll have ham this year. I think turkey is definitely off the menu for the foreseeable future.'
