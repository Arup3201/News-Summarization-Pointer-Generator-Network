A gardener who lied to his girlfriend about being mugged to avoid getting into trouble for buying his friends drinks has been jailed for wasting police time.

Christopher Kimberley, 24, blew £150 on drinks on a group of friends including his boss, landscape gardener Jamie Cox, during a night out in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire.

When asked by his girlfriend where the money had gone, he panicked and told her Mr Cox had taken his card and pin number and stolen money from his bank account.

Christopher Kimberley, 24, was jailed for six months yesterday after admitting lying to police over money he spent on beer

Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court heard that Kimberley’s girlfriend and father contacted police, and he kept up the story when he was questioned by officers.

As a result of Kimberley's lies, Mr Cox was eventually arrested and held in a police cell for 12 hours while questioned before he told police Kimberley must have made up the story to avoid getting in trouble with his partner.

Further checks with the bank revealed £100 had been withdrawn on the ‘stolen’ card before it was alleged to have been taken, and Kimberley was arrested.

He was jailed for six months yesterday after admitting intending to pervert the course of public justice and fraud.

Sentencing, Judge Paul Glenn criticised ‘time-wasting’ Kimberley for persistently lying to the emergency services.

He said: 'The man you named was arrested, interviewed and held in custody for almost 12 hours, and he was on bail for a couple of months before your lies came to light.

'You wasted a significant amount of police time and the time of an ambulance team who came out to see you when you complained of your injuries.

'What motivated this was covering up money you spent that day socialising.'

Prosecutor Paul Farrow said Kimberley spent 25 April working for Mr Cox but later went drinking in Hanley, Stoke-on-Trent, and spent cash buying Mr Cox and others drinks.

The following day Kimberley told 
police £150 had been withdrawn from his account.  In a second statement 
he said £140 was taken in two withdrawals of £100 and £40.

'The lie snowballed.  It just escalated.'

Mr Farrow added that as a result of the allegations, the bank refunded him with £112.82.

Paul Cliff, defending, said Kimberley, who has learning difficulties, had been out with Mr Cox and two other men.

He said: 'He had with him a wad of cash.  He bought most of the drinks.

'Eventually his girlfriend contacted him and he had to explain where the money had gone.  He gave her an account of the money and the card being taken as to why he could not afford to get a taxi...

'The lie snowballed. It just escalated.'

The court heard Kimberley has since apologised to Mr Cox.

A spokesman for Staffordshire Police said: 'We will not tolerate individuals who abuse public services and this result sends a clear message out to anyone who thinks they can get away with making false reports - you face arrest, conviction and ultimately prison - which will impact on the rest of your life.'
