It was his first return visit to the organisation he once ran since sexual assault charges were dropped.

Dominique Strauss-Kahn took the chance to apologise to staff of the International Monetary Fund for any troubled caused after sexual assault charges against him were dismissed last week.

Mr Strauss-Kahn, 62, drove himself and his wife Anne Sinclair to the IMF headquarters in Washington D.C. and met briefly with his successor and fellow French national Christine Lagarde.

Happy: Dominique Strauss-Kahn and Anne Sinclair are seen outside their home on Monday in Washington D.C.

He later addressed a packed auditorium out of reach of the cameras of televisions crews and photographers who had camped outside the IMF all day waiting for the former director.

‘He received a very warm welcome,’ said Paulo Nogueira Batista, who represents Brazil and eight Latin American countries. ‘It reflects the fact that he is very much appreciated in the institution.’

Mr Strauss-Kahn told staff he wanted to ‘apologise to those who have been hurt’ by the scandal and was sorry that the case had a negative impact on the IMF, one employee told AFP.

Staff broke into spontaneous applause before Mr Strauss-Kahn began speaking - but he did not talk about his court case. However he did note the U.S. justice system had been fair, one witness said.

An IMF spokesman said the visit by Mr Strauss-Kahn was personal and arranged at his request.

His visit had been greeted ahead of time with dismay by some IMF staff, while others said they felt sorry for Mr Strauss-Kahn and wanted to pay tribute to his time at the helm of the global lender.

Mr Strauss-Kahn led the IMF, the world's economic firefighter, as managing director for four years.

But he resigned in May after his shock 
arrest in New York on criminal charges of sexual assault and attempted 
rape involving a hotel maid.

In a dramatic development last week, prosecutors asked that the charges against him be dismissed after they lost faith in the credibility of his accuser, an immigrant from Guinea.

Mr Strauss-Kahn had been expected to be voted France's next president in the 2012 election before his arrest - but he could still relaunch his political career now the charges have been dropped.

Movers have packed up belongings from Mr Strauss-Kahn's residence in Washington D.C. and speculation is rife over whether he plans to leave his adopted American home after losing his job.

Meanwhile, his lawyers have hinted they could take legal action against the woman who accused him of rape in the sensational case, if her lawyers use 'despicable' methods to defend their client.

Following the news his rape charge was dropped, Mr Strauss-Kahn is now free to travel the world again after getting his passport back from prosecutors.

It remains unclear when he might put the document to use, as he said he ‘can't wait to go back’ to his native France but has other things to do first.

As a team of family friends appeared to pack his belongings into a U-Haul van at his Georgetown home, questions hand over his future plans.

Just last week, Mr Strauss-Kahn was pictured in New York looking much happier with life.

Strolling through the sunny streets of New York foot-loose and fancy-free with Ms Sinclair, he sported a more laid-back look.

It was a far cry from the blue suicide smock he was photographed wearing days after being sent to Rikers Island prison when he was accused of raping a Sofitel hotel chamber maid in May.

Mr Strauss-Kahn earlier paid a moving 
tribute to Ms Sinclair, who stood beside him throughout the entire 
ordeal, even paying for his expensive townhouse when he was placed under
house arrest.

'I am most deeply grateful to my wife 
and family who have gone through this ordeal with me. We look
forward to returning to our home and resuming something of a more 
normal life'

'I am most deeply grateful to my wife 
and family who have gone through this ordeal with me,’ he said. ‘We look
forward to returning to our home and resuming something of a more 
normal life.'

But he did not appear to be in any 
hurry to return to his native France when he was photographed wandering 
around the streets of Manhattan in the sunshine with Ms Sinclair.

It seems the French are not ready to welcome him back with open arms either.

A poll revealed that most French 
people do not want disgraced former IMF chief to return to politics, 
despite the fact he was being touted as the next president before the 
rape scandal.

The survey found 53 per cent of the 
French want Mr Strauss-Kahn to play no part in build-up to the 
presidential elections next year. Only 23 per cent were in favour of him
contesting the election.
