From food to medical instruments, it seems that 3D printing can be used to create almost anything.

And now a team of ambitious architects are using the additive manufacturing technique to build an entire house.

They are using an industrial scale 3D printer called a room builder to engineer the plastic parts that will be fused together to create everything from walls to the furniture.

A team of ambitious architects are using 3D printing to build an entire house, shown in this artist's impression. Dus Architects's futuristic building is described as an exhibition, research and a building site for 3D printing architecture, which connects the science, construction and design communities

The house is the brainchild of Amsterdam-based firm Dus Architects.

It is being built by the side of a canal in the north of the city and will be the world's first 3D printed house.

The structure will have 13 rooms and is inspired by a traditional gable design.

It is being printed by a giant 3D printer called KamerMaker or the 'room builder'.

The machine will pipe thick lines of molten plastic around 10 times as large as lines printed by 'home' printers.

Construction has been under way for around one month.

The interior and exterior of rooms can be printed in one part and there is space within the blocks for cables, pipes and wiring because of their honeycomb and lattice design.

The ‘world’s first’ 3D printed house, which is being built by a canal in north Amsterdam in the Netherlands, will boast 13 rooms when it is finished and concrete will only be used to provide structural support - at least at the moment.

Amsterdam-based firm Dus Architects’s futuristic building is described as 'an exhibition, research and a building site for 3D printing architecture', which connects the science, construction and design communities.

The 3D Print Canal House is being printed using the KamerMaker, which means room builder and pipes plastic lines of molten plastic on top of one another according to computerised plans – just like a gigantic version of a home 3D printer.

The machine, which is made by Dutch firm Ultimaker, pipes lines around 10 times as large as a standard 3D printer and can create pieces of building that are 6ft wide, 6ft deep and 11ft tall (2metres by 2meters by 3.5metres).

Construction has been under way for around one month and so far a 9ft (three metre) high corner section has been printed, weighing 397lbs (180kg), according to The Guardian.

Giant pieces like the corner will be used much like Lego bricks and stacked on top of one another to make the house, which is inspired by the traditional Dutch gabled town houses.

The design consists of a number of rooms – each with unique features - which will be designed separately on site, before being assembled into the house, so experts can test their safety.

Using computers to design and print the structure means that architects can create a house that has structural integrity, while also looking aesthetically pleasing so that the interior and exterior of rooms can be printed in one part.

There is space within the plastic block walls for cables, pipes and wiring because of a honeycomb lattice design.

The plastic used to print the house is ‘a renewable, sustainable, strong, tactile and beautiful material that can compete with current building techniques,’ according to the architects.

Scientists are currently testing different samples of materials to create the perfect one but the final ‘hot melt’ product will be approximately 80 per cent natural as it is a bioplastic mix made up of microfibres and plant oil.

Hedwig Heinsman from the architect firm said: ‘We’re still perfecting the technology. We will continue to test over the next three years, as the technology evolves… It’s an experiment.’

At the moment, the lattice blocks are being filled with less sustainable concrete, which would make the structure, hard to recycle, but this seems to be an intermediary step.

Here are some small examples of different types of walls, and the honeycomb cavities are easily visible

If the house is a success and the technology honed, the architects hope that 3D printing could mark a new era in building houses.

The cost of transporting materials and waste could be cut using the technique and the final buildings could be dismantled and moved in units, or completely recycled.

Mr Heinsman said: 'This could revolutionise how we make our cities. This is only the beginning, but there could be endless possibilities, from printing functional solutions locally in slums and disaster areas, to high-end hotel rooms that are individually customised and printed in marble dust.’
