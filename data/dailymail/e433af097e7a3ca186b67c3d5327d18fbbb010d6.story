When Bernard Ambrose Dearsley drowned in 1943 after the ship he was serving on was torpedoed, he left a family secret which has taken 70 years to uncover.

The British soldier had two wives, one in England and one in Scotland, who were totally unaware of each other's existence.

But thanks to a chance encounter, the two branches of the family are set to be reunited this year, and have spoken of their joy at finding each other.

Couple: When Bernard Dearsley, right, was presumed dead during the Second World War, he had for 17 years been married to Josephine, left

Bernard was presumed dead after his ship sank in the Mediterranean, leaving behind Josephine, his wife of 17 years.

She lived with their three children, Ralph, Cyril and Leon, in Bexley, south London.

However, when he was stationed in Dumfries in 1942, he secretly married a second wife, a Norwegian woman named Margaret.

Just eight days before the attack which is believed to have killed the Army captain, Margaret gave birth to their son, Robert.

Reunion: Bernard's granddaughter Sarah Wilkinson, pictured, is set to meet her secret Norwegian family for the first time ever

Bernard's second wife returned to Norway after the end of the Second World War, leaving two families completely unaware of each other.

His descendants are now spread over 3,500 miles and three countries - but they will come together in Croydon in April for the first time.

The first inkling the family members had of their secret relatives came when Robert's daughter-in-law found a character called Bernard Dearsley in a novel.

She discovered that the book had been written by Bryan Dearsley, Leon's son and Bernard's grandson.

Papers: The family had lots of information on the soldier, but did not know about his Norwegian wife

Tragic: The telegram which let Josephine know that her husband was missing at sea 70 years ago

Robert got in touch with his long-lost nephew, and also managed to contact Sarah Wilkinson, Ralph's daughter.

The trio are planning to meet at Sarah's home in Croydon to uncover more of the mystery surrounding their late grandfather.

Bryan, 50, who now lives in Canada, said he was overcome with emotion when he heard from his Norwegian uncle.

'I immediately responded, and shared what little I knew about my grandfather,' he said. 'We compared the few documents we had, including Bernard's birth certificate and notification of his death, and there was no doubt it was the same man.'

Disaster: The soldier was on board the Benalbanach went it was torpedoed in the Mediterranean

And Sarah, 56, said there was no bad blood between the two family branches, despite her grandfather's well-kept secret.

'It is all history now,' she said. 'I think my grandfather did the right thing in marrying Margaret because she had fallen pregnant. Things were different back then. I think people would have expected it.

'My grandmother had a very interesting life so nothing surprises me, but no doubt it's a fascinating discovery. It has certainly made me more interested in my family tree.'
