Arsene Wenger is keen to tie up a deal for France attacking midfielder Yoann Gourcuff this week.

The Arsenal boss is a long term admirer of the 27-year-old star, who has scored three goals in 13 league appearances this season.

Lyon have been hit by financial problems in recent years and despite the club president stating no-one is for sale, the Gunners enquired about their asking price at the start of January.

French star: Yoann Gourcuff has scored three goals in 13 league appearances this season

Gourcuff is an alternative to Schalke's German star Julian Draxler 
who would cost considerably more, and is still injured for the next few 
weeks.

Meanwhile Wenger and the Arsenal board are due to meet this week to discuss Draxler but Gourcuff could be an 
easier deal to get over the line before the transfer window closes on Friday.

Gourcuff's career has been full of ups and downs, from being a precocious teenager at Rennes to a flop at Milan through to resurrecting his career at Bordeaux and Lyon.

He has 31 caps for France since his debut in 2008, scoring four goals.

Meanwhile, Arsenal defender Nico Yennaris is joining League One Brentford.

The 20-year-old right-back, from Leytonstone in east London, who made his Gunners debut in the League Cup against Bolton in 2011, has had spells on loan at Notts County and Bournemouth but is set to move to the west London club on a free transfer.Â 

The League One leaders are hoping the 
England U19 man can help maintain their push for promotion and
 ensure Championship football for next season.
