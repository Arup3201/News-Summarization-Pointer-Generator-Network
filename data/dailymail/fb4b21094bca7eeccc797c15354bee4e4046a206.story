Childhood sweethearts who discovered they were born on the same maternity ward just days apart are now celebrating their golden wedding anniversary. 

Stuart and Marlene Hinchliffe, from Upper Hopton, Mirfield, West Yorks, started courting after he spotted her on the school bus and fought off tough competition from his friends to ask her out. 

But at the tender age of 14, neither of them knew they could have met before as babies in hospital. Seven years later, they were married.

Union: Stuart and Marlene Hinchliffe were born days apart in the same maternity ward. Twenty-one years later the childhood sweethearts were married - and are now celebrating their golden wedding

Mr Hinchliffe, 72, said: 'We went to different schools but I used to see her while I was on the bus. 

'We finally met at an inter-schools sports day and I found the courage to ask her out. 

'It was a case of who could get there first between me and two friends, and I won.'

The
young couple split just a year later, but when Stuart spotted Marlene 
Thewlis working in a shoe shop in Mirfield, West Yorks, he thought he 
would try his luck once again. 

'I went over and slapped her bum!' he said. 'I asked her out again and the rest is history really.

'We found out through chatting, as you do, that we must have been on the maternity ward at the same time.

No
rows: Stuart and Marlene, who were married in Mirfield on 24 August, 
says the secret to their happy 50 year marriage is to have patience and a
sense of humour - and not to let the little things become the big 
things

Happy: The two, pictured here on their wedding day in 1963, met on the school bus in 1956

Stuart says: 'I proposed to Marlene in Guernsey in 1960. Luckily she said yes and we married on my 21st birthday'

'Our mothers didn’t know each other but we could probably hear each other’s cries.

'I proposed to Marlene in Guernsey in 1960. Luckily she said ‘yes’ and we married on my 21st birthday on August 24, 1963.' 

Stuart
trained as an apprentice hairdresser and the couple opened a 
hairdressing salon in Huddersfield, which is still in business today. 

They went on to have two children, Russell and Tracy, and they now have four grandchildren - Stephen, Zoe, William and Molly. 

Mr Hinchliffe said: 'We are a very close family, and it is very important to us. 

'We all live very close to each other and we always meet up for Christmas, birthdays and special occasions.

'We have had a lot of support from both our parents and in turn, our children, throughout our marriage.' 

The
pair enjoy travelling together and have been as far afield as Kenya, 
South Africa and Thailand, however they opted for a short break with 
their family to Whitby, East Yorks, to celebrate their golden wedding 
anniversary.

Long-lasting love: Stuart and Marlene at their ruby wedding 25 years ago

Tribute: Stuart says Marlene is the one who has held the whole family together. 'Our family happiness as a whole is down to her hard work,' he says

Mrs Hinchliffe, also 72, said: 'Stuart is very easy to live with and he makes me laugh, which I think is very important.'

However
Mr Hinchliffe said: 'Marlene is the one who has held the whole family 
together, and our family happiness as a whole is down to her hard work.

We get on with each other - we don’t row. She’s not so bad for putting up with me.'

They
both agree through that patience and sense of humour is crucial to 
making a marriage work, as well as not letting the little things become 
big things.
