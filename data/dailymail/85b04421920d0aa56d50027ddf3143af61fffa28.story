'When you have your child throwing up on 
your shoulder, and your dog is puking on the couch in the other room and 
you're not really sure what to do first, those are really the frustrating days,' she explained.

In a bid to help other first-time parents Ms von Oy has been chronicling her trials and tribulations via a blog titled The Cradle Chronicles.

'It is crazy making, wonderful, terrifying and phenomenal all at the same time'

It covers everything from breastfeeding to her daughter's crawling antics and the latest post covers the subject of teething.

She explains that the home that she shares with her husband Brad Bratcher and their five dogs, is now strewn with children's toys and 'every surface is coated with a thin layer of drool.'

Summing up motherhood in one sentence, she said: 'It is a constant adventure. It is crazy making, wonderful, terrifying and phenomenal all at the same time.'

Asked what part is terrifying, she replied laughing: 'Waking up in the morning. As simple as that.'

Dr Jennifer Ashton, a medical contributor applauded Ms von Oy for writing about her experiences and reassuring other parents that they are not alone.

'I think for a lot of mothers they have an idea of what motherhood will be like and pretty quickly reality sets in … Support is key,' she said.

Ms von Oy also details how she has little time for herself, and often doesn't get a chance to shower.

'Some days I simply look in the mirror, huff audibly, and decide a combination of deodorant and perfume will just have to do.

'It’s the perfect accompaniment to my sweatpants, T-shirt, and un-brushed hair, I suppose.'

But she said she wouldn't trade motherhood for anything.

'Is it more difficult than I imagined?  Sure. But the surprises really are the best parts of parenting, I think,' she said.

She adds on her blog that having the 'having the ability to spend each day with Gray is something I feel both blessed and passionate about.'
