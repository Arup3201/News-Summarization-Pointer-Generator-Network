A strike by militant French air traffic controllers has left thousands of British tourists and business travellers stranded across Europe.

Most major French cities were affected and the knock-on effect is likely to continue into today.

Hundreds of services to and from British airports heading for destinations such as Paris, Lyon, Nice,  Toulouse and Marseilles were cancelled yesterday.

Nice airport is one of those affected by the air traffic controller's strike that has left thousands of Brits stranded

Flights that cross French airspace were also cancelled or delayed, including holiday destinations in Spain and Portugal.

In another black day for the country’s
socialist government, many air traffic controllers stayed at home for 
the second day prompting French aviation bosses to order all airlines 
using French airports to cancel 50 per cent of their services.

Last night Greek air traffic 
controllers were reported by airlines to be calling a ‘siesta strike’ – 
from noon to 2pm today – which will disrupt and delay some flights.

Controllers in both countries are protesting against a planned overhaul 
of aviation by the European Commission to create what has been nicknamed
‘a single European sky’.

They fear this plan to centralise air traffic 
control across the EU will lead to job losses.

Low cost carrier easyJet was yesterday forced to cancel 200 flights – of which 92 were to or from the UK – because of the chaos.

Ryanair said around 400 of its flights
had been cancelled across Europe, including many to and from Britain. 
British Airways cancelled 24 UK flights. All said they hoped to run a 
‘near normal’ service today.

The militancy is due to spread to 
French railways. French rail unions threatened to cancel up to 70 per 
cent of services in protest at reform of their working practices.

Easyjet has had to cancel 128 flights due to the industrial action, forcing thousands to make other plans

These include high speed TGV services, with the stoppages due to start last night and to continue into tomorrow.

But Eurostar services from London to 
Paris are not expected to be affected. Passengers reported a mixed bag 
of help from airlines. EasyJet said it had booked 1,800 hotel rooms for 
stranded passengers before the strike.

But Ryanair customers who contacted 
the Daily Mail spoke of ‘shocking customer service’ and a ‘couldn’t care
less’ attitude’ and said they had paid out hundreds of pounds for their
own hotel rooms.

Passenger watchdogs said that under EU
rules airlines must look after their passengers if there’s a delay and 
put them up in a hotel for a flight the next day when it is impractical 
to go home.

Publican Matt Edwards, 36, from 
Penrith in Cumbria, was stranded at Manchester Airport with his two 
daughters Emma, eight, and Mia, seven, and his partner Lisa Gardiner, 
when their 3.55pm Ryanair flight to Alicante was cancelled on Tuesday.

Mr Edwards said: ‘It was awful. You 
can’t blame them for the strike. But their customer service is 
appalling. I’ll never fly with them again. I’m hundreds of pounds out of
pocket.’

Ryanair said later that it would 
comply with EU rules and urged passengers to keep their receipts for 
reasonable out of pocket expenses, including hotels.

Watchdogs said those not offered 
hotels should keep their receipts and be prepared to complain to the 
Civil Aviation Authority, which is now the official passenger watchdog.

A spokesman for easyJet said: ‘We 
deplore the action of the French air traffic controllers. It is 
massively unfair that they should disrupt so many passengers. Passengers
on cancelled flights are able to receive a refund or transfer to 
another flight.’
