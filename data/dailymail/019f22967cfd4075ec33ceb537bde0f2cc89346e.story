Former heavyweight champion Frank Mir rolled back the years in Porto Alegre on Sunday night with a first-round knockout win over Antonio 'Bigfoot' Silva.

The win for the American veteran, his first in his last five UFC outings, defied the odds for the ninth time at the Brazilian event, which will be remembered as a night of major upsets.

After a tentative minute and a half of action to open the main event, Mir landed a jab followed by a clean left hook that sent the Brazilian hurtling to the canvas before a series of grounded strikes left referee Leon Roberts with no choice but to stop the contest.

Mir credited his year-long lay-off as one of the major factors behind the victory, due to him spending his time away from competition to focus on his pugilistic skills.

‘I came out looking for the jab,’ explained Mir in his post-fight address. ‘I know that he hits hard, he’s got a long right hand, so both my striking and wrestling coach told me to switch back to orthodox.

‘I took some time off, learned how to box the correct way and that’s why you saw the jab setting up. The dominating jab is one of the important punches, especially in the heavyweight division.

‘I was banged up and I was facing top five guys, four of five times in a row. I was hindered and injured, and I wasn’t at 100 per cent, but I had that never say die attitude where I’d never turn down fights.

‘Since that accident and everything that’s happened in my life, the comebacks and the mental fortitude, it could have been a hindrance like it was too much of a mountain to climb.’

However it was the American who emerged victorious after a one-sided decision from the judges 

Michael ‘The Menace’ Johnson put a relentless pace on Edson Barboza to claim a one-sided decision win over the sixth ranked Brazilian in the co-main event of the evening, announcing himself as a contender at 155lbs in the process. The victory saw Johnson call out division hopping former lightweight champion Benson ‘Smooth’ Henderson.

Sam Alvey pulled off one of the more high profile victories in a night full of upsets when he saw off surging Brazilian middleweight Cezar ‘Mutante’ Ferreira.

Alvey evaded a series of spectacular kicks before he caught Ferreira with a right-left combination that brought an end to his night in round one of their main card bout.
