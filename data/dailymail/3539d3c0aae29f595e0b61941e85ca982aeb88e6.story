A goal celebration in Brazil led to hundreds of fans being crushed as a wave of supporters performed their signature 'avalanche' celebration and surged across a packed terrace.

Two women were rushed to hospital and at least eight fans received immediate first aid following the crush at last night's game between Gremio and Ecuadorian side Liga de Quito at the Arena Gremio in Porto Alegre.

An opening goal in the 63rd minute by former Manchester City midfielder Elano Blumer pulled home side Gremio back level on aggregate in the Copa Libertadores second leg match, sparking wild celebrations.

The home fans charged forwards, creating a human 
avalanche that caused one of the terrace's protection barriers to cave
in and a number of supporters to fall off the edge of the stand.

Players from both sides immediately 
ran over to the front of the terrace where fans could be seen screaming 
for help and urged fans to move back up the terrace.

Emergency services rushed to the scene and helped carry out injured fans.

Once the fans had returned to their original positions further up the terrrace the game continued with Gremio winning on penalties after extra-time to reach the group stage of the tournament.

The 'avalanche' celebration is customary among football fans in South America where terraced stands are still a common feature.

The security breach comes less than a
week after a nightclub fire killed 234 clubbers in Brazil's Santa Maria,
raising questions as to whether the country
possesses the necessary infrastructure to support the 2014 World Cup.

Although not designated as one of the 
World Cup's venues, Arena Gremio is one of the nation's newest stadiums.

According to Globoesporte and SporTV, both women are in a stable condition, and should be released later in the morning.

Chief
engineer Eduardo Antonini, who oversaw the construction project, was 
quick to assure investigations would be carried out: 'It is an 
engineering matter, and we want to achieve 100 per cent safety,' he told SporTV.

'We
will carry out the necessary technical analysis, and look through the 
details calmly tomorrow. We do not want further injuries at the 
stadium'
