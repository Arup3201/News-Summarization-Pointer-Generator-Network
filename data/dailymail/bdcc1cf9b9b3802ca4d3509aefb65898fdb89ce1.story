A new invention aiming to improve posture by vibrating when people slump in their chairs, could help prevent back pain.

UpRight is a wearable device that sticks to the lower back with a gentle hypoallergenic adhesive.

Using multiple sensors the device vibrates gently when posture starts to worsen.

It was designed to combat the 'posture epidemic' - a phenomenon caused by the sheer number of hours we spend hunched in front of computers.

Bad posture not only causes back pain, but it has negative effects on respiration, internal organ function and even productivity.

By providing gentle vibrating reminders to sit up straight, UpRight hopes to be a daily reminder of the importance of a straight spine.

It can even connect to a special mobile app which has an individual training programme developed by experts.

Users can see daily goals, receive posture analytics or statistics and motivate family and friends who are also using the app.

Creators boast the programme could even help users master their posture without the device after just a few weeks.

The creator and founder of UpRight, Oded Cohen, said: 'The idea for UpRight came many years back as I wanted to assist my mum with her slouching habit.

'Unfortunately, I waited too long. In the past year my mum has been suffering from lower back pain and now needs regular pain relief medications.'

Having finalised the product's design, UpRight is now part of a 60-day crowdfunding program on Indiegogo.com and there are hopes to take the product to market by July 2015.

Ugandan born Mr Cohen, said: 'It's very exciting to have an idea that will actually improve people's lives and health.

'But now we need support to make the idea a reality.

'In return, our funders get to look younger, taller, leaner, more confident and successful and most important, live a healthy life with less back pain.'

UpRight has a four-day battery life, a USB port for charging and inbuilt bluetooth.

It's smart silicone design weighs just 30 grams and measures just 10cm in length. It is expected to cost around £75.

Osteopath Thomas Parry, of Parry Physical Health, said maintaining good posture allows the body to function efficiently.

The Suffolk-based practitioner said by sitting badly at work, slouching in the car or walking with rounded shoulders, people compromise their posture, putting excess strain on different parts of the body, which over time can lead to pain and in some cases structural changes in the body.

He said to maintain good posture it is vital to regularly move around, taking breaks from sitting or standing in one position.

He said: 'Bad posture can lead to breathing difficulties, it can slow down your digestive system, as well as causing the more common complaints of low back pain, neck and shoulder pain, tension headaches, aching through the hips and more.

'People often come to see me after they’ve injured themselves doing something at the weekend, like working in the garden, but often the problem stems from the posture they have adopted during the preceding days.

'I advise many of my patients to imagine they are a string puppet being pulled up through the top of their head, which engages your core muscles and in turn your shoulders will drop, your neck will elongate and your rib cage will lift.

'This allows you to breath more easily and reduces the load on your lumbar spine. My patients often tell me they are lighter on their feet as a result.'
