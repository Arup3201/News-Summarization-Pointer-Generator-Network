In an unforgiving display of partisanship, the Republican-controlled House approved emergency legislation Friday night to avoid an unprecedented government default and Senate Democrats scuttled it less than two hours later in hopes of a better deal.'We are almost out of time' for a compromise, warned President Barack Obama as U.S. financial markets trembled at the prospect of economic chaos next week. The Dow Jones average fell for a sixth straight session.Lawmakers in both parties said they were determined to avoid a default, yet there was little evidence of progress — or even significant negotiations — on a compromise during a long day of intense political maneuvering.The House vote was 218-210, almost entirely along party lines, on a Republican-drafted bill to provide a quick $900 billion increase in U.S. borrowing authority — essential to allow the government to continue paying all its bills — along with $917 billion in cuts from federal spending.

That marked a concession to tea 
party-backed conservatives and others in the rank and file who had 
thwarted House Speaker John Boehner's attempt to pass the bill Thursday 
night.

'Today we have a chance to end this debt limit crisis,' Boehner 
declared, his endgame strategy upended by rebels within his own party.

But the changes he made to the House GOP bill further alienated 
Democrats. And they complicated prospects of a compromise that could 
clear both houses and win Obama's signature by next Tuesday's deadline.

At the other end of the Capitol, Senate Democrats rejected the measure 
without so much as a debate. The vote was 59-41, with all Democrats, two
independents and six Republicans joining in opposition.

Moments later, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., unveiled an 
alternative that would cut spending by $2.4 trillion and raise the debt 
limit by the same amount, enough to meet Obama's terms that it tide the 
Treasury over until 2013.

Reid invited Republicans to suggest changes, saying, "This is likely our last chance to save this nation from default."

The Senate GOP leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, accused Democrats of
'rounding up 'no' votes to keep this crisis alive, and noted the House 
had passed two bills to raise the debt limit and the Senate none.

The House, eager to return the Senate's favor rejecting the Boehner 
bill, set a vote to reject Reid's proposal on Saturday. The Senate set a
test vote at about 1 a.m. on Sunday, a middle-of-the-night roll call 
that underscored the limited time available to lawmakers.

At the same time Reid appealed for bipartisanship, he and other party 
leaders accused Boehner of caving in to extremists in the GOP ranks — 
"the last holdouts of the tea party," Sen. Richard Durbin of Illinois 
called them.

Republicans conceded that the overnight delay had weakened Boehner's hand in the endgame with Obama and Senate Democrats.

But the Ohio Republican drew applause from his rank and file when he 
said the House, alone, had advanced legislation to cut deficits, and 
that he had "stuck his neck out" in recent weeks in hopes of concluding a
sweeping deficit reduction deal with Obama.

Boehner's measure would provide a quick $900 billion increase in 
borrowing authority — essential for the U.S. to keep paying all its 
bills after next Tuesday — and $917 billion in spending cuts. After the 
bill's latest alteration, any future increases in the debt limit would 
be contingent on Congress approving the constitutional amendment and 
sending it to the states for ratification.

"With conservatives insisting on the addition of a balanced-budget 
amendment requirement, Speaker Boehner's bill will now cut, cap and 
balance" federal spending, said Rep. Jeff Flake of Arizona as Friday's 
scheduled vote approached.

The White House called the bill a nonstarter. Press secretary Jay Carney
issued a statement that called it a "political exercise" and said 
congressional leaders should turn their efforts to a compromise that 
Obama can sign by Tuesday.

The developments occurred one day after Boehner was forced to postpone a
vote in the House for fear the earlier version of his measure would 
suffer a defeat. But by forcing a delay the conservative rebels upended 
the leadership's strategy of making their bill the only one that could 
clear Congress before a default and win Obama's reluctant signature.

"Everybody acknowledges that because of the dust-up yesterday we've lost
some leverage," said Rep. Steven LaTourette, R-Ohio, an ally of the 
speaker.

The rebels said they were more worried about stemming the nation's steady rise of red ink.

Rep. Jeff Landry, R-La., a, a first-term lawmaker, issued a statement saying his pressure had paid off.

"The American people have strongly renewed their November calls of 
bringing fiscal sanity to Washington. I am blessed to be a vehicle 
driving their wishes to fruition," he said. "This plan is not a 
Washington deal but a real solution to fundamentally change the way 
Washington operates."

Administration officials say that without legislation in place by 
Tuesday, the Treasury will no longer be able to pay all its bills. The 
result could inflict significant damage on the economy, they add, 
causing interest rates to rise and financial markets to sink.

Executives from the country's biggest banks met with U.S. Treasury 
officials to discuss how debt auctions will be handled if Congress fails
to raise the borrowing limit before Tuesday's deadline.

But Carney said the administration did not plan to provide the public 
with details Friday on how the government will prioritize payments.

The day's economic news wasn't very upbeat to begin with — an economy 
that grew at an annual rate of only 1.3 percent in the second quarter of
the year.

The Dow Jones industrial average suffered through a sixth straight day 
of losses, and bond yields fell as investors sought safer investments in
the event of a default.

At the White House, Obama cited the potential toll on the economy as he urged lawmakers to find a way out of gridlock.

He said that for all the partisanship, the two sides were not that far 
apart. Both agree on initial spending cuts to take effect in exchange 
for an increase in the debt limit, he said, as well as on a way to 
consider additional reductions in government benefit programs in the 
coming months.

"And if we need to put in place some kind of enforcement mechanism to 
hold us all accountable for making these reforms, I'll support that, 
too, if it's done in a smart and balanced way," he said.

That went to the crux of the conflict — his insistence that Congress 
raise the government's borrowing authority by enough to avoid a repeat 
of the current crisis during the heat of the 2012 election campaigns.

Republicans have resisted, accusing him of injecting purely political considerations into the debt limit negotiations.

But Boehner's failure to line up the votes for his legislation Thursday night seemed to embolden Democrats.

Obama asked his 9.4 million followers on Twitter to send tweets to Republican lawmakers.
