Baroness Sally Morgan has claimed she is being forced out of as chairman of schools watchdog Ofsted in a Government move to oust non-Tories from key posts.

The Labour peer’s contract, due to end this month, has not been renewed.

She said last night: ‘There is a determined effort from No 10 that Conservative supporters will be appointed to public bodies.’

A source close to Lib Dem Schools Minister David Laws said: ‘The decision to get rid of Sally Morgan had absolutely nothing to do with her abilities and everything to do with Michael Gove’s desire to get his own people on board.’

A No 10 spokesman admitted that Mr Gove had taken the decision, but denied that it was political.

‘This Government appoints people on merit. For example, Sally Morgan herself,’ he said.

David Cameron was today accused of seeking to purge public bodies of officials who do not support the Conservative Party.

Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, she added: 'I am the latest of a fairly long list of people now who are non-Conservative supporters who are not being re-appointed.

'I think there is absolutely a pattern. It's extremely worrying.'

It
 was reported that Michael Gove was keen to appoint a 'fresh face' - 
despite the fact that Lady Morgan, a Labour peer, is a strong supporter 
of the Education Secretary's free schools and academies.

However, she insisted today that she 
had not fallen out with Mr Gove and suggested that No 10 was behind the 
decision not to give her another three-year term.

'One
 of the really important things about public appointments is that they 
are made on the basis of merit and they are seen to be transparently 
made,' Lady Morgan said. 'I think there is something going on in the 
centre that's mitigating against that.

'I think there is an absolutely determined effort from No 10 that Conservative supporters will be appointed to public bodies.

Although Lady Morgan is seen as a strong supporter of both Mr Gove's free schools and academies programmes, it is believed the Education Secretary wanted a fresh face in the post

'It
 has been a quiet, quiet drip. I'm not talking about Labour people being
 replaced, I'm talking about non-Conservative supporters being replaced 
by Conservative supporters.

'There
 is a lot of concern about it. Often they are people who have been 
working really well with their organisations and, indeed, with their 
host departments, so I do think this is coming from No 10.'

Although
 Lady Morgan was once a close adviser to Tony Blair, she was seen as 
being close to Mr Gove and he has paid tribute to her 'tremendous 
contribution' to the work of Ofsted.

The peer, whose current term is due to end this month, is expected to carry on until the autumn while a successor is found.

The moves comes amid tensions between 
Mr Gove and Ofsted - the Chief Inspector of Education, Sir Michael 
Wilshaw, was angered by media reports that there were plans to reform or
 even replace the organisation.

Mr
 Gove was forced to issue a statement voicing his full support for Sir 
Michael and promising to dismiss any aides if they were found to be part
 of any 'dirty tricks' campaign.

Paying
 tribute to Lady Morgan, he said: 'She has brought great knowledge and 
insight, leading the board strongly through a period of significant 
change, both managing the smooth transition when there were changes in 
Chief Inspector, and leading the reforms to the inspectorate and its 
work.'

'I hope that she continues to play an active role in helping to shape the education landscape to improve standards for all children and young people.'

Lady Morgan told The Independent: 'Ofsted plays a crucial role in delivering independent inspection that is trusted by the public and particularly by parents.

'I am proud of helping lead Ofsted through a period of reform that has strengthened our inspections.'

'Our tougher regime is driving improvements with more good schools and colleges than ever before.

'There is also a renewed focus on raising expectations in all parts of the country and for all children, including the most disadvantaged.'

Baroness Sally Morgan of Huyton - a former geography teacher and mother of two  - joined the Labour Party in 1985.

She has held several posts at Labour HQ , including director of campaigns.

In 1997, she joined Tony Blair's office in Downing Street as political secretary. She was made a life peer in 2001

After a brief stint as Cabinet Office minister with responsibility for women she rejoined No 10 as director of government relations.

She left Downing Street in 2005.

She has also held roles as a nonexecutive director at Carphone Warehouse and as a board member of the Olympic Delivery Authority.
