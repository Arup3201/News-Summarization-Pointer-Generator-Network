While the venue for The Wedding of the Year seemed to be an open secret, the location for its sequel - The Honeymoon of The Year - still appears to be under wraps.

But instead of jetting off to five-star luxury as predicted, it seems Kim Kardashian and Kanye West have opted for something a little more modest to mark the start of their married life.

With the media circus that's surrounded their special day, the newlyweds fancied something rather more simplistic for their honeymoon - a campervan break in the countryside.

Just touched down in romance town! The happy couple, Kim and Kanye, waste no time 
posing for a trademark selfie to mark the start of The Honeymoon of the Year

Are we headed North or West, Darling? The newlyweds wile away the first few hours of marital bliss by floating down a nearby river in a tandem canoe. Could this honeymoon get any more romantic?

And the answer is yes! Kanye West, famous for his rap lyrics, opts for a more starry-eyed tone as he serenades his new wife with the love-inspired lyrics he dreamed up on the water

The incredible images showing lookalikes of Kim and Kanye on their honeymoon were created by spoof photographer Alison Jackson to celebrate the launch of new Travel Channel show RV Rampage

These incredible images show the loved-up couple wiling away the first few days of their honeymoon by canoeing down the river, singing love songs around the campfire and playing intimate games of Swingball - while all the while donning their trademark bling.

The pair look the epitome of happiness as they share a low-key picnic of strawberries and Champagne, before they snuggle down together in their campervan, on a campsite that looks virtually-empty.

But if you're struggling to understand what has caused this sudden change in the collective Kimye, take a closer look - because these pictures aren't quite what they seem. 

Alison Jackson, best know for her 'spoof' productions of celebrities and royals, has been at it again, this time mocking up dozens of photos which show what the happy couple might get up to on their honeymoon to mark the start of new show RV Rampage on the Travel Channel .

Using uncannily similar models, the photographer has given an alternative version of the Kimye honeymoon - which, judging by their opulent wedding, is more likely to feature five star hotels and Champagne on tap, rather than paddle boarding and al fresco dining.

The hilarious photos depict the couple enjoying every day camping activities on their honeymoon. They show the pair cosying down for the night in 
their campervan - with Kanye still sporting his trademark sunglasses as 
he tried to catch a bit of shut eye.

The pictures also show Kim giving Kanye a shave to make sure he is primed for the cameras, before she hangs out her wedding dress on the washing line.

And in true Kimye style, the pair make sure they record every moment of the treasured holiday, by stopping to pose for trademark selfies - which they no doubt posted onto Twitter.

RV Rampage is on Travel Channel at 9pm weekdays until June 6.

Kim gasps as Kanye shakes the Champagne and sprays it over his new wife in celebration of their marriage - likely to be the biggest extravagance of their otherwise low-budget honeymoon

It might not be the seven courses featured on their wedding day, but Kim looks the picture of happiness as her husband romantically feeds her a juicy strawberry

Kim can't resist making sure her husband is looking his scrubbed-up 
best, as she gives him a shave with a disposable razor and a lukewarm 
bowl of soapy water

The campervan - which Kanye tries to reverse into a tight space, pictured right - might be small... But the Forte di Belvedere just doesn't have the same charm

Kim gets dressed into her best sports gears and dons her trademark gold bling as she takes on Kanye in a swingball match - the epitome of romance

Couldn't afford a speedboat? Kanye treats Kim to a boat ride in a plastic canoe - not quite the private jet they were shipped around in for their two-day wedding bonanza

Thank you, Baby! Kanye ensures Kim feels comfortable as she hits 
the water in a bright pink lifejacket, stiletto heals and sparkling jewellery

Does my bum..? Kim wishes she was back in the Hall of Mirrors now as she glances behind to check her famous derriere looks its best in her white bikini

Don't fall in! Kanye takes some time out of the hectic honeymoon schedule to enjoy a solo peruse along the river on his paddle board

Maybe I can save it for North! Kim makes sure her wedding outfit is clean and fresh as she hangs it out to dry outside the couple's lakeside campervan
