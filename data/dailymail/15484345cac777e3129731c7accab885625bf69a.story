More than 200 seriously ill patients, including 20 babies, were forced to evacuate one of New York City’s major hospitals late Monday after the power went out.

The frantic exodus followed the failure of a backup generator, with dozens of ambulances lining up around the block outside New York University Tisch Hospital. 

Doctors and nurses started with the sickest and youngest, many of whom are in critical care. Some were on respirators operating on battery power.

Children were seen being carried out of 
the hospital into waiting ambulances, while a mother was wheeled to 
safety on a stretcher as she clutched her newborn baby.

Concerns: Medics help a patient into an ambulance during an evacuation of NYU Tisch Hospital, after its backup generator failed

A doctor has today spoken about the nightmare scenario and how he and his colleagues evacuated patients - many of whom were too sick to walk down staircases - out of the hospital.

Dr Jonathan LaPook told CBS news: 'They were painstakingly carried on plastic sleds, one by one, by teams of four to five people from as high up as the 17th floor.'

He added that another Dr, Mark Pochapin, co-ordinated communication between staff and ensure that everyone was accounted for.

Dr LaPook added: The intensive care unit was already evacuated when I arrived. Lit only by my flashlight, filled with crumpled blankets and other evidence of a hasty retreat, it appeared eerie to me - like a scene in a movie where a cup of still warm coffee tells the detective that somebody had been in a room only minutes before.

'But this was undeniably real life and the clock was ticking as the team of workers raced to evacuate the patients.'

'It's a challenging situation,' NYU 
Medical Dean Robert Grossman told WCBS-TV. 'We drill all the time for 
this kind of thing. But this isn't a drill. This is the real thing.'

Painstaking care: Ambulances line up outside Tisch as doctors and nurses begin the slow process of taking people out

Much of New York was plunged into darkness by superstorm Sandy, a monstrous hybrid that swept across the East Coast.

Most of the power outages in lower 
Manhattan, where Tisch is located, were due to an explosion at an 
electrical substation, officials at Consolidated Edison said.

Without power, there are no elevators,
 meaning patients - some of whom are being treated for 
serious illnesses such as cancer - had to be carefully carried down staircases, 
said Grossman.

As the patients were evacuated, gusts 
of wind blew their blankets. Nurses and staff huddled around the 
patients, some holding IVs and other equipment.

Ambulances came from around the city 
to help transport the sick. Patients will be taken to other hospitals 
including Mount Sinai and the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer.

Hospitals across the city are struggling
 to care for their patients after widespread power outages left more 
than 250,000 in the dark.

Fears: Medical workers assist a patient into an ambulance during the evacuation at Tisch

Poised: Ambulances line First Avenue in anticipation of patients being evacuated from Tisch, Langone Medical Center's flagship hospital

Tisch, which has 705 beds, is Langone medical center's flagship hospital and sits directly off the banks of the East River at 30th Street.

Bellvue
 Hospital, which stands next door to Langone, is now running out of fuel
 for its backup generators and may be forced to evacuate patients, as 
well, according to WNYC.

In Brooklyn, Coney Island Hospital is dark after running out of power, the Huffington Post reported.

Mayor 
Michael Bloomberg said: ‘The one thing that we had not counted 
on, New York University's hospital backup power, in spite of them making
 sure, ensuring us that it's been tested, has stopped working.

'And we're working with them to help move people out.’

Langone had previously vowed to stay open – though many of the 800 patients were released prior to the storm.

The 215 who remained were in urgent need of medical care.

About 45 of them were seriously ill, including children and babies in neonatal critical care. 

The hospital complex is near the East River in an area of lower Manhattan, the scene of widespread flooding.

Bloomberg says a few parts of lower Manhattan still have power. He said 
there have been a large number of fires reported from downed power 
lines.

Patients were evacuated from Hoboken University Medical Center in New Jersey in anticipation of the storm.

Tens of thousands of people were ordered to vacate ground-floor units in the state's coastal areas as 60million people living along the heavily populated North-East corridor braced for the onslaught.
