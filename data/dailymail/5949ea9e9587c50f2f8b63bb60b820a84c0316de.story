Police in Norway have rejected a complaint by mass murderer Anders Breivik that his treatment in jail amounted to 'serious torture'.

The far-right terrorist who killed 77 people in a bombing and mass shooting on July 22, 2011, filed a formal complaint against the Norwegian Minister of Justice and a prison director, in which he said his daily body searches and outdated video games were equal to 'aggravated torture'.

The complaint filed in January last year was examined by police but a preliminary investigation was closed on Monday according to police commissioner Ingrid Wirum.

In this letter sent to media outlets Breivik complained he was being subjected to 'torture' because he had to play outdated video games and undergo daily body searches

‘On this basis we have concluded that neither the prison in Ila nor the people mentioned in the complaint are guilty of any wrongdoing,’ Ms Wirum told AFP.

Lawyer Tord Jordet told AFP his client Breivik ‘was not surprised’ by the decision, The Local reported.

‘He noted that the case has been closed despite significant documentation which demonstrates the violation of European prison regulations and human rights,’ Mr Jordet said.

‘It does not seem that the police wanted to investigate thoroughly.’

Breivik, who is serving a 21-year sentence, has repeatedly threatened to go on hunger strikes in protest of his treatment in prison.

In a letter received by various media outlets last month, which was sent to prison authorities in November 2013, the right-wing extremist detailed 12 demands including the right to communicate more freely with the outside world and access to a computer rather than a typewriter.

Breivik, who was recently moved from the Ila prison outside Olso to the Telemark prison in Skien, also demanded that his Playstation 2 be upgraded to a PS3 and that he be given ‘access to more adult games that I get to choose myself’.

‘Other inmates have access to adult games while I only have the right to play less interesting kids games. One example is "Rayman Revolution", a game aimed at three year olds,’ Breivik wrote.

Breivik also asked for an armchair to replace his ‘painful’ chair, his weekly allowance of 300 kroner (£30) to be doubled and his mail to cease being monitored and censored by the jail.

‘You've put me in hell ... and I won't manage to survive that long. You are killing me,’ the convicted killer wrote.

‘If I die, all of Europe's right-wing extremists will know exactly who it was that tortured me to death ... That could have consequences for certain individuals in the short term but also when Norway is once again ruled by a fascist regime in 13 to 40 years from now.’

In the letter, which was also sent to Norway’s anti-torture watchdog, the mass murderer also claimed to have written a book which is he is unable to send to a publisher.

According to Breivik’s lawyer Mr Jordet the more than 1000-page book gives fresh details on the planning on his 2011 bombing and shooting rampage as well as reasons for the attacks.Breivik murdered eight people when he bombed the outside of a government building in Oslo and massacred another 69 people at a youth camp on the island of Utoya.
