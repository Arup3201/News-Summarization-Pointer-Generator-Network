James Holmes smirks for the camera and sticks out his tongue in photos taken on his iPhone just before he allegedly sprayed bullets inside a Colorado movie theater.

The photos, shown in court on the final day of his pre-trial hearing today, also show the accused gunman holding a Glock pistol under his face and displaying his high-powered arsenal arranged on his bed.

Also found on the phone were photos of the Colorado movie theater taken weeks before the shooting, implying that he had cased the theater in the weeks before the bloody shooting.

One photo shows an exit door that 
looks like the one police say Holmes propped open the night of the 
shooting so he could re-enter the theater after getting weapons from his
car.

The pre-trial hearing laying out the evidence against the accused gunman ended Wednesday with the defense deciding not to call witnesses to attest to Holmes' mental health.

Prosecutors argued that they had 
shown that Holmes acted with deliberation and extreme indifference before the attack 
that killed 12 and injured 58.

Prosecutor Karen Pearson said Holmes picked the perfect venue for his alleged crime.

'He didn't care who he killed or how many he killed, because he wanted to kill all of them,' she said.
There is not, the agent replied.

The judge said he will rule by Friday on whether Holmes should stand trial. If the judge decides he should be tried, Holmes could enter a plea at a hearing scheduled that day.

Cases rarely advance to this stage without a judge agreeing to set a trial.

Defense attorneys decided not call any witnesses, saying the rules of the preliminary hearing severely limited what evidence they could present.

They had been granted permission to call two people to talk about Holmes' mental state.

His lawyers are expected to present an insanity defense.

They have previously stated that Holmes, 25, is mentally ill.

Defense lawyer Tamara Brady pointedly asked a federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives agent in court Tuesday whether any Colorado law prevented 'a severely mentally ill person' from buying the 6,295 rounds of ammunition, body armor and handcuffs that Holmes purchased online.

Horror: Authorities say Holmes entered the theater with a ticket and propped open a door, went to his car and returned with weapons

On Tuesday, the case was dominated by the litany of Holmes' preparations.

He spent months amassing tear gas grenades, two Glock handguns, a shotgun and an AR-15 rifle, along with 6,295 rounds of ammunition, targets, body armor and chemicals, prosecutors said.

He also purchased chemicals including improvised napalm, as well as thermite, a substance which burns so hot that water can't extinguish the blaze.

Holmes' purchases were for two planned attacks, prosecutors said - the theater shooting and the booby-trapped apartment that would have blown up if anyone had entered.

The attempt at a distraction speaks to a plan to escape, but the traps weren't triggered.

Holmes, clad from head to toe in body armor, was found standing by his car outside the theater.

He told investigators that the booby-trapped apartment was an effort to pull police away from the theater. He didn't expect to see officers so quickly.

Police said he volunteered information about the booby traps. Authorities went to the apartment and carefully dismantled them.

On Monday,
the first responders to arrive after Holmes waged the shooting rampage 
gave harrowing accounts of the massacre in court.

The first to speak was Officer Jason Oviatt from the Aurora, Colorado Police Department.

He
was the one who ordered Holmes onto the ground and handcuffed him after
he spotted the alleged shooter 'just standing there' in full swat gear.

Officer Oviatt said: 'He seemed very detached from it all. Very, very relaxed,' according to NBC.

Oviatt was among several officers who spoke in court on the first day of pre-trial hearings for Holmes.

The policeman had been working the late shift when 911 calls came through.

Oviatt recounted seeing 'a trail of 
blood that led to the theater' as he first confronted Holmes, who was 
wearing a helmet and gas mask.

He said at first he thought Holmes was a fellow cop, because he was 
dressed in body armor, but he grew suspicious as he noticed Holmes was sitting calmly, and not running toward the murder scene.

Oviatt said he pointed his gun at Holmes, who 'immediately put his hands up' when ordered to freeze. He then handcuffed him and searched him.

Somber account: Aurora Policeman Justin Grizzle leaves the courtroom after testifying that he slipped in blood on the floor of the theater

He
said he found two knives and a semi-automatic handgun on top of Holmes'
car, adding that an ammunition magazine also fell out of Holmes' pocket
and he found another one on the ground.

Officer Justin Grizzle testified that Holmes had a 'smirk' on his face as the carnage unfolded around him.

Fighting back tears, Officer Grizzle recalled today how he saw 'several' bodies - and slipped on blood that was on the floor as he entered the theater.

Grizzle recalled taking some of the wounded to the hospital and said he had to stop one man who was worried about his seven-year-old daughter from jumping out of the moving patrol car.

He said there was so much blood in his car that he could hear it sloshing around.

The hearing will be the best 
opportunity yet for survivors to find out about Holmes' mental state and
the sequence of events that led up to the attack.

The hearing will allow the judge to 
determine whether the prosecution's case is strong enough to warrant a 
trial, but it's rare for a judge not to order a trial if a case gets 
this far.

Dark night: Defense attorneys have not said whether Holmes will enter an insanity plea

If Holmes is found sane, goes to 
trial and is convicted, his attorneys can try to stave off a possible 
death penalty by arguing he is mentally ill.

Prosecutors have yet to say whether they will seek the death penalty.

If he's found not guilty by reason of insanity, he would likely be sent to the state mental hospital, not prison.

Such a defendant is deemed not guilty because he didn't know right from wrong and is therefore 'absolved' of the crime, said former Jefferson County District Attorney Scott Storey.

Last year, Bruco Strong Eagle Eastwood was acquitted by reason of insanity of attempted first-degree murder in the wounding of two eighth-graders outside a school not far from Columbine High School.

Eastwood is spending time in a mental hospital. His case will be reviewed every six months until he's deemed sane and released.
