Filipe Luis has moved a step closer to sealing a £20million move to Chelsea, after the Blues confirmed they had agreed a fee with Atletico Madrid.

The 28-year-old Brazilian had been banished to train with the reserves in Spain after expressing a desire to follow Diego Costa to Stamford Bridge.

But now Luis is inching towards arriving at the west London club, with the left back only having to agree personal terms before becoming a Chelsea player.

After Cesc Fabregas (£30m) and Costa (£32m), it will take Chelsea's summer spending to £82m.

A statement on the Chelsea website 
read: 'Chelsea Football Club can confirm an agreement has been reached 
with Atletico Madrid for the transfer of Filipe Luis.

'The move is subject to the 28-year-old left-back agreeing personal terms.'

Atletico
 had already bought a replacement in Granada’s Guilherme Siquiera but 
have refused to allow Luis to go until Chelsea agreed to pay the buy-out
 clause.

They
 are already losing Costa and Tiago Mendes to Chelsea, while goalkeeper Thibaut 
Courtois is also expected to return to Stamford Bridge.

Luis has formed a good 
friendship with Courtois and the two will help each other in London.

Chelsea manager Jose
 Mourinho has also renewed his interest in Real Madrid defender Raphael 
Varane, who is seeking assurances that he will become a regular starter 
at Real.

Carlo Ancelotti does not want to sell but Chelsea are willing to offer more than £30million if they sense a deal can be done.

Meanwhile,
 Besiktas have denied agreeing a deal to sign Demba Ba and Marik Marin 
on loan from Chelsea despite reports on Turkish TV.
