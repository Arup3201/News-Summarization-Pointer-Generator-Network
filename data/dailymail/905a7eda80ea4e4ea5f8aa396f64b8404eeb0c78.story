Maura Murray, 72, now lives with 20 per cent kidney function

When you go to hospital for surgery, your main concern is that the procedure is a success and fixes the problem.

A
 secondary concern might be worries about catching a hospital superbug -
 but that fear may be misplaced, because you are actually much more 
likely to develop acute kidney injury (AKI).

Few people have heard of
 AKI, let alone realise they could be at risk. But astonishingly, one 
patient in five admitted to hospital for surgery or to treat an 
infection - that's half a million people in the UK every year - develops
 AKI.

The condition causes the kidneys to shut down within days and,
 left untreated, can lead to severe dehydration and even death. Every 
year at least 12,000 people die of acute kidney injury - that's 200 
times more deaths than are caused by MRSA (methicillin-resistant 
staphylococcus aureus).

Furthermore, up to 1,000 more people per year
 need a lifetime of dialysis or a kidney transplant as a result of what 
should be an entirely treatable condition.

Acute kidney injury is 
also hugely expensive to the NHS - costing more to treat each year than 
breast cancer. Yet the sums needed to diagnose and treat it are 
negligible.

Diagnosis requires a simple blood test along with 
regular measurement of urine output. Treatment is with standard 
antibiotics and intravenous fluids to rehydrate the kidneys.

What worries experts is that too often medics dismiss AKI symptoms as insignificant.

Maura
 Murray's experience is typical. In April 2012, the retired maths 
teacher from Surrey, now 72, was recovering in hospital after surgery 
for a broken thigh bone.

The night before she was discharged, she 
had to go to the loo several times - and told the nurse she was worried 
she might have picked up a urinary tract infection.

'The nurse told 
me that going to the loo frequently was normal after having a catheter 
removed,' says the mother of three grown-up children.

It's true that
 having a urinary catheter can make the urethra extra-sensitive for a 
day or so, causing people to go to the loo more frequently.

But one 
person in ten who has a urinary catheter removed develops a urinary 
tract infection - and this can easily move to the kidneys if untreated. 
Indeed, a urinary tract infection is a main reason for acute kidney 
injury following post-surgery.

'It should have rung alarm bells with
 the nurse, but at the time I was delighted to be reassured,' says 
Maura. 'The last thing I wanted was to stay in hospital.'

Within hours of getting home she was shaking uncontrollably, a symptom known as a 'rigor'

So she was 
discharged as planned. But within hours of getting home she was shaking 
uncontrollably, a symptom known as a 'rigor' that is associated with 
serious infections.

This should have been a red flag for AKI in 
someone who is over 65 and has had recent surgery, says Professor Donal 
O'Donoghue, a kidney specialist at Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust.

Yet
 when Maura's husband Gerard, 74, called their GP surgery, the doctor 
insisted that the symptom was caused by the painkillers she'd been given
 by the hospital - and told her to switch to paracetamol.

Two days later, Maura was still suffering from uncontrollable shaking and persistent vomiting.Her
 husband rang the GP, who prescribed antibiotic tablets. 'Even if I 
could have kept them down, the antibiotics on their own were no help at 
all - as I subsequently discovered,' says Maura. 'I also needed 
intravenous fluid to hydrate the kidneys and protect them from damage.'

Over the following week, three more doctors made reassuring noises as Maura became steadily more dehydrated.

Eventually, her face swelled up - a sign of severe dehydration - and her husband called 999.Within an hour, an A&E doctor had diagnosed acute kidney injury and Maura was put on a drip.'I
 later found out that I only had 10 per cent of kidney function left,' 
says Maura. Yet astonishingly, once admitted to a hospital ward, she 
continued to suffer because of staff ignorance of the condition. 'No
 one measured my blood or hydration levels and the drip was not 
replaced. I was just told to drink, even though I still couldn't hold 
anything down.

The number of litres of urine filtered by the kidneys every 24 hours

'Nor did I see a kidney specialist - even though one was on duty in the hospital that weekend.

'I just don't think anyone had a clue why I was in hospital, and no one really cared.'

Maura
 believes it was only by a fluke that she survived. After three days, 
staff became convinced - wrongly - that she had the superbug clostridium
 difficile. By then she was 'barely alive, unable to keep anything down 
and with severe diarrhoea'. But a family friend put them in touch with a
 kidney specialist attached to the hospital.

'If this doctor hadn't 
walked into the room where I was being left to deteriorate, and insisted
 on supervising my care, I'm certain I would have died,' Maura says.

The
 specialist saw her every day for a week, insisting on daily blood 
tests, then fortnightly as an outpatient for the next three months. 'I 
was anaemic due to AKI and needed blood transfusions and checks to 
ensure my blood pressure was normal,' she says.

Two years on, her 
kidney function is now 20 per cent. She tires easily but fortunately 
does not need dialysis or a kidney transplant.

'All of this was so 
unnecessary,' says Professor O'Donoghue, who co-authored an official 
report that highlighted the problem. 'At the point where someone has 
developed a bacterial infection, it can be treated successfully with a 
simple antibiotic.'

Commenting on the nurse's response to Maura when 
she was first discharged from hospital, he says: 'Here we have a typical
 example of someone not bothering to listen to the patient.

'It's an example of the deep-rooted professional complacency about the symptoms of dehydration in healthcare today.'

She was left without intravenous hydration and nearly died

The
 problem, according to Dr Ed Kingdon, a kidney specialist at Brighton 
& Sussex University Hospitals NHS Trust, is that doctors have 
traditionally focused on treating AKI when the kidneys have failed - 
rather than intervening to prevent the infection spreading in the first 
place.

'Medical students learn that AKI is a kidney disorder, and 
once they qualify it doesn't occur to them that every patient can 
develop AKI.

'Nor do they take into account that older people and 
those already suffering from diabetes, heart failure, liver disease or a
 kidney disorder are especially at risk.'

Once AKI is suspected, 
diagnosing it is quite simple. A blood test to measure levels of 
creatinine (a waste product filtered out by the kidneys) shows if the 
kidneys are performing. This is already a routine test carried out when 
people are admitted to hospital.

Dr Mark Thomas, a kidney specialist 
at the Heart of England NHS Foundation Trust, explains that healthcare 
professionals need to use these results and compare them with further 
tests, to monitor the patient for signs of AKI. 'But too often this 
isn't happening,' he says.

The hope is that new guidelines, published
 last year by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence 
(NICE), will change this. They state that anyone over the age of 65, as 
well as those admitted to hospital with a  long-term heart or liver 
disorder, or who has an infection, should have their creatinine levels 
monitored regularly.

Maura is campaigning to make everyone more 
kidney-aware. 'Doctors, nurses and patients should know that 
uncontrolled shaking could be a symptom of AKI - and as such is an 
emergency,' she says.'It's been truly shocking to discover that it's
 quite common for doctors to ignore a disorder that's easily as 
dangerous as a heart attack or stroke.'
