A council has spent £42,000 of taxpayers' money on shuttling workers to a call centre 524ft away in taxis.

Lincolnshire County Council collects and drops off dozens of customer service workers for the 160m journey across the River Witham.

The trips might be tiny, but they cost the taxpayer £7,000 a year and have run for six years.

But the Conservative-led council has defended its decision to drop workers off, claiming that they had a 'duty of care' to staff, who had raised concerns about walking to work in the dark.

Zoe Butler, head of the customer service centre, said: 'During a staff survey a few years ago, safety concerns were raised by those who walk to and from Witham Park House and the Spa Road area during the winter months.

'The majority of staff are female and, as a responsible employer, the council agreed to provide transport from November until March at the beginning and end of the day.

'Currently the service is mainly used by staff from our Customer Service Centre and other colleagues within Witham Park House.

'The road is due to be upgraded this year, which will provide a safer walking route for our staff, and remove the need for transport in future years.'

She said there had been some incidents which involved the police being called, the BBC reported, but officers told The Sun that there had been no reports of attacks or serious crime.

The service runs between 8am and 9.30am and 3.30pm until 6pm from November until March.

A Lincolnshire County Council spokesman said: '

Robert Oxley, campaign director for the Taxpayers' Alliance, told both The Sun and the BBC: 'It seems an utterly absurd waste of taxpayers' money to provide cabs for a hundred metre journey.

'Employers should encourage staff to take responsibility for their safety.

'It's difficult to imagine that any other employer not funded by taxpayers would think cabs are an appropriate solution to such a short distance.'

Lincolnshire County Council has been criticised before about how they spend taxpayers' money.

It spent money paying famous musicians their royalties so that they could use their songs as 'hold music' while residents waited for their calls to be answered.

The authority discovered more modern easy-listening chart songs - such as Abba and Billy Ocean - dramatically reduced the number of people hanging up.

Lincolnshire County Council said the number of people who hang up while on hold has more than halved since piping commercial tracks down the telephone to those in the queue.

Lincolnshire is one of a handful of authorities to have ditched traditional hold music in favour of easy-listening chart songs, which require royalty payments to the Performing Rights Society (PRS).

Councillor Richard Davies, executive member for highways at Lincolnshire County Council, said:

'People can be kept waiting for a few minutes at peak times so we use commercial songs for our on-hold music. Quite frankly, our callers love it.

'It costs just £175 per year and since we introduced it, we have reduced our abandoned call rate by half - from 4,000 calls per month to just 1,600.

'I would, however, like to take this opportunity to apologise for our use of the Lighthouse Family’s Ocean Drive. I accept this was a deplorable lapse in judgement and we deserve all the criticism we get.

'In our defence, it was either that or M People’s Moving On Up.'
