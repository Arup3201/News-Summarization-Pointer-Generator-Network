The UK is now a worse place to give birth than even Slovenia and Estonia, according to research.

Britain has failed to rank among the top 20 places to be a mother – coming in at a meagre number 23.

Researchers say the UK’s poor rating is partially down to higher infant and mother mortality rates than in other parts of Europe.

It means this country is now a worse place to have a baby than former Soviet and Balkan countries, which have seen rapid improvements in living standards.

The Mother's Index assesses mothers' wellbeing using indicators of maternal health, under-five mortality, levels of women's education, income, and political status.

Britain is also four places below Greece, despite the country’s economic turmoil.

1 - Finland
2 - Sweden
3 - Norway
4 - Iceland
5 - Netherlands
6 - Denmark
7 - Spain
8 - Belgium
9 - Germany
10 - Australia
11 - Austria
12 - Switzerland
13 - Portugal
14 - Slovenia
15 - Singapore
16 - France
17 - Italy
18 - New Zealand
19 - Greece
20 - Ireland
21 - Estonia
22 - Canada
23 - United Kingdom
24 - Czech Republic
25 - Israel

The table was compiled as part of  Save the Children’s State of the World’s Mothers report, published today.

In the Mothers’ Index, which looks at
 how countries around the world are  succeeding in saving the lives of 
mothers and newborn babies, Finland, Sweden and Norway took the top 
three slots respectively.

Ireland ranked at number 20, the US at number 30, Germany at 9 and France number 16.

Last year, the UK ranked 10th – but a
 spokesman for the charity said the criteria had changed since then so 
its fall to 23rd was not a fair like-for-like comparison.

One of the main differences is that the number of indicators has been reduced from 12 to five.

The index now assesses mothers’ 
wellbeing using indicators of maternal health, under-five mortality  and
 levels of women’s education, income, and political status.

The charity said: ‘Reducing the 
number of indicators shines a spotlight on what matters most in the 
lives of mothers and their children.

‘The indicators now primarily capture
 important outcomes.’ Researchers said education was  an important 
factor because children of educated women were more likely to survive 
and be healthy.

Political status was measured  by recording the number of women in national government in each country.

It is a factor because when women 
have a voice in politics, issues important to mothers and children are 
more likely to surface on the national agenda.

Income was measured as gross national income per capita and indicates how many resources the mother would have access to.

Coming in at number 23, the UK has 
fewer women in Parliament and higher maternal and infant mortality rates
 than much of Europe, the charity said.

Women in Britain are at a higher risk
 of dying during pregnancy or childbirth than women in Slovakia, 
Montenegro and Lithuania, according to the statistics.

The report says a reason for this is 
the age women are having babies, with teenage and IVF pregnancy rates 
resulting in the UK having a higher proportion of young and old mothers 
than much of Europe.

Another reason is poverty and 
inequality. Women with unemployed partners were six times more likely to
 die from maternal causes than those with partners in work.

However, the UK is also more robust 
than many European nations in collecting infant and maternal mortality 
data, which may contribute to comparatively higher rates.

Countries in sub-Saharan Africa take 
up each of the bottom ten places in the index.  In these countries, 10 
to 20 per cent of mothers are underweight due to poor nutrition or 
underage pregnancy.

The Democratic Republic of Congo ranks as the world’s toughest place to be a mother.

Justin Forsyth, CEO of Save the 
Children, said: ‘Overall the world has made unprecedented progress in 
reducing child and maternal deaths.
‘But there are two big challenges: newborn [deaths] and malnutrition.’
The charity said that globally, one million babies die each year on the 
day they are born – or two every minute – making the first day by far 
the riskiest day of a person’s life.

A baby in the developing world is seven times as likely to die on its first day than one  born in industrialised nations.

A baby born in the UK has  a roughly 1 in 200 chance of dying before its fifth birthday, higher than in South Korea  or Israel.
