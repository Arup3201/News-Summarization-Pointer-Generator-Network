Radio DJ Neil 'Dr' Fox was arrested at his studio in London today over claims that he sexually assaulted two women.

The former Pop Idol judge was held on suspicion of four alleged offences just moments after he finished presenting his breakfast show on Magic FM.

The married father-of-three was taken to a central London police station where he was questioned for more than seven hours.

Scotland Yard said three of the claims were 'historical' while a fourth is alleged to have taken place earlier this year. He has now been bailed, pending further police inquiries. 

The 53-year-old, who has been married to wife Vicky since 1999, has presented Magic FM's breakfast show for nine years.

He was arrested by Westminster Police in front of colleagues at the station's studios in Soho, London, shortly after coming off air this morning.

Bauer Media, which owns Magic FM, confirmed the arrest in a statement and said his show would be off air for the foreseeable future while the claims are dealt with. 

It said: 'Bauer Media can confirm that Neil Fox, presenter of the Magic Radio breakfast show, was today arrested by Westminster Police. He is currently being questioned about various allegations.

'In the circumstances Neil will be off air from tomorrow to enable him to devote his full attention to dealing with these matters. All other aspects of his contract will remain unchanged while matters are resolved. We can make no further comment at this stage.'

Earlier this month Neil Fox hosted Magic FM's London's Biggest Breakfast which was attended by Mayor Boris Johnson, who hosted a breakfast club at the event. He joined the commercial radio station in 2005

A spokeswoman for Scotland Yard did not name the broadcaster, but said officers had searched addresses in Fulham, west London and in the area of Littlehampton, West Sussex.

The probe is the latest in a long line of high-profile and sensitive inquiries into the conduct of ageing celebrities up to 40 years ago. 

But his arrest is not part of high profile sex crime investigation Operation Yewtree, which was set up in the wake of revelations about BBC presenter Jimmy Savile.  

A spokeswoman for Scotland Yard said: 'Officers from Westminster this morning arrested a 53-year-old man following allegations of historical sexual assault relating to two women.

'Three of these are described as historic, though we have no time frame on them, and one allegation is from earlier this year.

'The man was arrested at a business address in central London and taken to a central London police station.

'He has now been bailed, pending further inquiries, to return in early December.

'Officers today searched two addresses, one in Fulham, and another in the Littlehampton area of West Sussex.' 

Mr Fox, who is known by nicknames 'Doctor Fox' and 'Foxy, started his career in local radio before moving the Radio Luxembourg and later Capital FM. 

There he presented in a number of slots, rising to fame as a DJ in the early 1990s. In 1993 he was given the job of hosting the Pepsi Network Chart on Sunday afternoon.

The Top 40 show soared in popularity and at one time had a bigger audience than its Radio 1 rival.

He was later rumoured to have been offered the coveted breakfast slot on Radio 1, following the departure of Chris Evans.

Fox went on to present a Channel 5 TV show based around the Pepsi Top 40 Chart and has won numerous awards throughout his career.

But he is perhaps best known as one of the judges on Pop Idol, a forerunner of X Factor, alongside Simon Cowell, Pete Waterman and Nicki Chapman.

The series ran on ITV from 2001 to 2003 and set the format of TV talent shows based on audience voting for the next decade.

Two years later Fox took the breakfast show chair on 105.4 Magic FM and has remained there ever since.
