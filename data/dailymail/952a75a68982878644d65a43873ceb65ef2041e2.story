A gene variant that appears to increase the risk of type 2 diabetes in some people can be traced back to Neanderthals.

A team of researchers in Mexico and the U.S. have conducted the largest genetic study to date in Latin American populations.

They discovered that people who carry a higher risk version of the gene are 25 per cent more likely to have diabetes that those who do not.

Neanderthal genes are spread across the genome of all non-Africans, as humans interbred with Neanderthals after leaving Africa between 60,000 and 70,000 years ago

leaving Africa between 60,000 and 70,000 years ago.

The gene variant was found as part of SIGMA’s (Slim Initiative in Genomic Medicine for the Americas) study of 8,000 Latin Americans, which sought to find a particular trait among individuals’ genes.

People who carry the higher risk version of the gene - SLC16A11 - thought to have been passed down by ancient ancestors - are 25 per cent more likely to have diabetes.

People who inherited copies of the variant from both their patents are 50 per cent more likely to have diabetes, according to the study published in Nature.

SLC16A11 has been discovered in up to half of people with recent Native American ancestry, including Latin Americans and around one fifth of East Asians. However, it is rare in populations from Europe and Africa.

The elevated frequency of this risk gene in Latin Americans could account for as much as 20 per cent of the populations’ increased prevalence of type 2 diabetes - the origins of which are not well understood.

SLC16A11 is part of a family of genes that code for proteins that transport metabolites, which are molecules involved in chemical reactions in the body.

Changing the amount of the SLC16A11 protein alters the amount of a type of fat implicated in the risk of diabetes.

The findings of the study suggest SLC16A11 could be linked to the movement of a mystery metabolite that affects fat levels in cells - which can boost the risk of Type 2 diabetes.

‘To date, genetic studies have largely used samples from people of European or Asian ancestry, which makes it possible to miss culprit genes that are altered at different frequencies in other populations,’ said co-author José Florez, an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and an Assistant Physician at the Centre for Human Genetic Research at the Massachusetts General Hospital.

‘By expanding our search to include samples from Mexico and Latin America, we’ve found one of the strongest genetic risk factors discovered to date, which could illuminate new pathways to target with drugs and a deeper understanding of the disease.'

The researchers wanted to understand what they describe as the ‘unusual frequency pattern’ for the variant of SLC16A11 and partnered with Svante Pääbo of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology to discover that the variant is found in a newly sequenced Neanderthal genome.

‘Analyses indicate that the higher risk version of SLC16A11 was introduced into modern humans through mixing with Neanderthal,’ according to the study.

The researchers' ultimate goal is to gain a deeper understanding of the genetic pathway to find new drugs for treating diabetes. Liptor, a medication that blocks the production of cholesterol in the body and is used to treat Type-2 diabetes, is pictured

Inheriting a gene from Neanderthal ancestors is not unusual, as around 2 per cent of the sequences present in all modern humans outside of Africa were inherited from Neanderthals who lived in what is now Europe and western Asia, between 400,000 and 30,000 years ago.

However, scientists have only relatively recently realised the advantages and disadvantages of inherited genetic material from Neanderthals.

David Altshuler, of the Broad Institute in Massachusetts and co-author of the study, said: ‘One of the most exciting aspects of this work is that we've uncovered a new clue about the biology of diabetes.’

‘We are now hard at work trying to figure out what is being transported…and what steps lead to the development of type 2 diabetes,’ he added.

The researchers’ ultimate goal is to gain a deeper understanding of the pathway to find new drugs for treating diabetes.
