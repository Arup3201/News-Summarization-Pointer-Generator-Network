Prince Charles has expressed an interest in Wentworth Woodhouse but is not yet directly involved in the project to save it

Prince Charles has expressed an interested in saving Britain's largest stately home, it was reported today.

Wentworth Woodhouse, near Rotherham, South Yorkshire, is a 365-room house which is twice as wide as Buckingham Palace.

The majestic house, built in the early 18th century, was in the hands of the country's wealthiest family after the Royals, the Fitzwilliams, from the late 18th-century to 1989.

But it was bought for just £1.5million by the Newbold family in 1999 because it was damaged by extensive mining in the region in the late 1940s which seriously affected its structure.

Its current owners are trying to sue the Coal Authority for £100million compensation and hope to use the money to restore the building.

Prince Charles, who has been on a private visit to the stately home, has received a letter from Marcus Binney, chair of Save Britain's Heritage, setting out plans to set up a trust to save the property.

The Prince has spoken to ministers about his interest in the house, the Sunday Times reported, but is not directly involved and is not expected to fund the project.

The enormous Grade I-listed house is 606ft across the front - the widest in Europe - and has more than 1,000 windows.

It is so large inside guests regularly got lost going back to their rooms after dinner so had to lay trails of confetti to find their way. 

Owner Clifford Newbold and his sons Paul, Marcus and Giles, who live in a small section of the building, have already spent £5million keeping the house going, on top of legal fees.

The restoration project is expected to be a mammoth task. Already it has taken 60 electricians to rewire the house.

And when the owners decided to redecorate some of the more elaborate furnishings it caused a national shortage of gold leaf.

In addition to any money they are granted through the courts from the Coal Authority, they are also hoping to receive support from the National Heritage Memorial Fund and the Heritage Lottery Fund.

They want to turn part of the building into a hotel, spa and conference centre, leaving other wings open to the public, including incorporating a museum into the house.

Giles Newbold told the newspaper: 'We have spent at least £5m trying to 
keep the house going but there is only so much that we as a family can 
put in. And then there has been the cost of the legal case.

'We just hope that finally we can bring this place back to its former glory.'

Peter Wentworth-Fitzwilliam, the 8th Earl, died in a 1948 plane crash in the south of France

Wentworth Woodhouse was built in the 18th century for the Rockingham family.

The wealthy family included the second marquess, Charles Watson-Wentworth who was prime minister twice.

The Fitzwilliam family inherited Wentworth Woodhouse in the late 18th-century and remained owners until 1989.

As a family, they were the subject of numerous scandals.

Billy Fitzwilliam, the 7th Earl, was accused of being a changeling who was swapped with an unwanted girl at birth.

He had to defend his rights to the estate in court.

But his son Peter did little to respect his father's struggle to keep the property in the family.

He spent most of his time on the French Riviera womanising and hanging out with the son of the Aga Khan, Aly Khan.

Peter was seeing John F Kennedy's sister Kathleen, but both died in a plane crash in 1948.

In a separate scandal, George Wentworth-Fitzwilliam, grandson of the 5th Earl, married Evie, a former chorus girl.

She in turn was so upset when her oldest son married a chorus girl she declared him illegitimate and disinherited him.
