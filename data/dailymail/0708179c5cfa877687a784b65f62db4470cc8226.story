A boy of eight could have lost his fingers playing with loom bands, his father said.

Brandon Lambert fell asleep with the elastic bands wrapped around two of his fingers, which turned black.

Fortunately his father Mark, 36, checked on him half an hour later.

A father has warned of the dangers of loom bands after his son Brandon fell asleep with several wrapped around his fingers - turning them black (pictured)

Brandon pictured with sister Elise, three. His father removed the bands after finding his son asleep with them around his digits - a move that most likely saved the boy's fingers

He said: ‘I don’t usually check on 
Brandon, but I am so glad I did. If the bands had stayed on his fingers 
all night then he might have had to get them amputated. The circulation 
had been completely cut off.

‘I took a picture quickly because I wanted to show Brandon how  dangerous they can be. He was shocked when he saw the picture.’

The
 landscape gardener, who lives in Skipton, North Yorkshire, with his 
wife Donna, 32, a carer, added: ‘Brandon spends up to six hours a day at
 the weekend playing with loom bands, but nothing like this has happened
 before. I have no idea why he likes them so much. I think it might be 
because it is a craze.

Loom bands are used to make bracelets like these pictured.  Numerous experts have warned the craze could be dangerous, as children could choke on the small items or cause harm to others and themselves

Kyle Lawrence, seven, may be blinded after his brother accidentally fired a loom band at his eye. He will undergo surgery in a bid to save the sight in his left eye following the accident earlier this week

The bracelets have a growing following among celebrities and sales rocketed after the Duchess of Cambridge was seen wearing one

‘They
 are marketed as a fun and safe product but I don’t think they are. They
 are like elastic bands, and elastic bands are not child-friendly. They 
can be dangerous.’

Mr Lambert posted his picture on Facebook to draw attention to the danger of what had happened.

One
 parent replied: ‘If my friend had not posted this I would not have 
checked my eight-year-old daughter and would not have found her asleep 
with two fingers starting to turn blue! So a big thank you, that’s one 
child you have saved!’

The 
incident is the latest in a spate of injuries. The Mail reported 
yesterday how seven-year-old Kyle Lawrence was blinded when a loom band 
flicked into his left eye. His mother Carlie has demanded that the bands
 carry a safety warning.

In Bristol, an unnamed GP and mother put a photo on Facebook of her sleeping son wearing the bands and losing circulation.

And
 Dr Anne-Marie Houlder, a senior GP in Stafford, has urged parents to be
 ‘vigilant’, warning: ‘They could be a choking hazard or cause 
circulatory problems.’

Loom
 bands were invented by a US father-of-two last year and have swept 
playgrounds this summer. Many parents welcomed them as a return to 
craft-based play.

The 
colourful rubber bands are woven together to make friendship bracelets 
and have been worn by celebrities such as the Duchess of Cambridge and 
pop stars Harry Styles and Miley Cyrus.

While
 a computer game can cost £40, 1,800 loom bands are as little as £2.50. 
They are already Amazon’s eighth best-selling toy of all time, after 
classics such as the Rubik’s Cube, Monopoly and Scrabble.

Headteachers,
 however, are increasingly banning pupils from bringing loom bands to 
school in an attempt to prevent them from causing playground squabbles 
and disruption to lessons.
