The Duchess of Cambridge, Victoria Beckham and Grammy award winner Adele have all made the shortlist for the Celebrity Mum of the Year Award 2013.

The award, which is voted for by the users of Foxy Bingo, usually results in a win for reality TV or D-list celebrities such as former winner, Stacey Solomon

But this year, Solomon and co have been replaced by a stellar mixture of high achievers and genuine A-listers.

In the running: Paralympian Dame Sarah Storey and designer Victoria Beckham both made the shortlist

This year's nominations, unveiled 
today, include Paralympic multiple gold medal winner 
Dame Sarah Storey and Debbie Daley, the mother of Olympic bronze medallist diver Tom Daley.

While TV and music stars do feature on the list, most have achieved much more than an appearance on a reality TV show.

Mothers on the list who do have TV careers include This Morning presenter Holly Willoughby and TV and radio host Fearne Cotton.

The nation has also recognised women who have had a traumatic year, such as footballer Wayne Rooney's wife Coleen, who tragically lost her sister Rosie, 14, and Michelle Heaton who underwent a double mastectomy and is facing heart surgery.

Myleene Klass and Andrea McLean, who are newly single after recently splitting with their partners, have also been chosen to appear on the shortlist.

Other nominees to make the public's shortlist are Emma Bunton, Lily Allen and Claire Richards, TV stars Tess Daly, Amanda Holden and last year's winner Katie Price.

Victoria Beckham has also been recognised for her ability to juggle her fashion empire and four children.

Previous winners have included Stacy Solomon, Kym Marsh and Sharon Osbourne, while Katie Price and Kerry Katona have both been Mum of the Year on more than one occasion.

The Foxy Bingo Celebrity Mum of the Year 2013 will be announced on March 10, just ahead of Mother's Day next month.
