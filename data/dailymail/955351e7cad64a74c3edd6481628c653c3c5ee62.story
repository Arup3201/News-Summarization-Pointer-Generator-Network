A bill banning the use of 
controversial therapy aimed at 'curing' homosexuality in gay teenagers 
has been stamped into law by California, making it the first state to 
outlaw the practice.

Gov Jerry Brown signed Senate Bill 
1172 yesterday, which prohibits doctors from performing 
any type of conversion therapy on lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender 
minors.

In a press release today,Â  Clarissa 
Filgioun, board president of Equality California, said: 'Governor Brown 
today reaffirmed what medical and mental health organizations have made 
clear: Efforts to change minors' sexual orientation are not therapy, 
they are the relics of prejudice and abuse that have inflicted untold 
harm on young lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Californians.'

Law: Gov Jerry Brown signed Senate Bill 1172 yesterday, which prohibits medical professionals from performing any type of conversion therapy on lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender minors

Conversion therapy is an attempt to change the sexual orientation of a subject from homosexual or bisexual to heterosexual.

Democratic Sen Ted Lieu, who sponsored the bill, said that he was 'honored' by the signing of the bill.

Sen Lieu told NBC News: 'An entire house of medicine has rejected gay 
conversion therapy. Not only does it not work but it is harmful. 
Patients who go through this have gone through guilt and shame, and some
have committed suicide.'

Advocates also warned that the controversial therapy could lead to depression and substance abuse.

Democrat Ricardo Lara, one of several
openly gay legislators to champion the bill during the debate, urged 
Assembly members last month to stand with 'sissy boys.'

'One of our number one priorities in 
this house is to protect the next generation of Californians,' Mr Lara 
said last month before the California State Assembly vote.

'And some of those are sissy boys. 
And some of those sissy boys grow up to be Assembly members. And some of
those sissy boys need help. And we are here to stand with those sissy 
boys.'

Opponents of the practice say such efforts can cause depression and lead to substance abuse and suicide.

Assembly member John Perez, the first
openly gay speaker of California's lower house, said during the debate:
'It is inappropriate for anyone, including parents, to subject anybody 
to dehumanising activity'.

Republican opponents of the measure 
argued that regulation of the therapy was a matter for medical boards - 
not politicians - to decide.

They said the bill encroaches on the rights of parents to make choices for their children.
