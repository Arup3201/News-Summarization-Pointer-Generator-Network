School: The abuse took place at the Queen Anne Elementary School in Mid-Wilshire, Los Angeles

A student has been awarded a record $6.9 million in damages for suffering sexual abuse at the hands of his elementary school teacher.

The civil lawsuit damages are believed to be largest ever awarded to a single victim in a 
molestation or lewd conduct case involving the nation’s second-largest 
school system.

A Los Angeles Superior Court jury took five hours to rule in favour of the teen, who was identified in the suit as Walter 'Matt' Doe.

The victim was 10-years-old when the abuse started in the classroom of Queen Anne Elementary School in the Mid-Wilshire, Los Angeles, during the academic year 2008-09.

He was abused 10 to 15 times during that year and another five times during the summer of 2009 by his teacher Forrest Stobbe, 41.

Stobbe was sentenced to 16 years in prison after pleading guilty in 2011.

The victim's lawyer argued that the headteacher and other employees failed to act on warnings and
could have taken action that would have prevented or limited the abuse.

Lawyers for Los Angeles Unified Schools District (LAUSD) insisted that the district 
was not responsible because there was no evidence, known to the 
district, that Stobbe posed a threat to children.

Lawyers for both sides agreed that liability for molestation by 
employees does not hinge on the acts themselves, but on the district’s 
actions and policies that would prevent or respond to harm to children.

The payout comes as LAUSD seeks to settle nearly 200 claims against it over 
allegations of abuse by teacher Mark Berndt at Miramonte Elementary 
School, Los Angeles.

He is suspected of spoon-feeding his semen to blindfolded children as 
part of what he called a 'tasting game,' among other alleged wrongdoing.

LAUSD General Counsel David Holmquist said in a statement that the safety of children was the district's top priority.

'We
are all impacted when a child is hurt,' Holmquist said.

'We take our 
duty to protect our students seriously and are continually looking for 
ways that we can strengthen our screening and reporting processes to 
ensure that no child is ever hurt in this way.

'Although we can't change 
what happened in this case, we remain committed to doing everything in 
our power to promote healing and improve trust with those impacted.'

Second largest in the nation, the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) enrolls more than 640,000 students in kindergarten through 12th grade, at over 900 schools, and 187 public charter schools.

The boundaries spread over 720 square miles and include the mega-city of Los Angeles as well as all or parts of 31 smaller municipalities plus several unincorporated sections of Southern California.
