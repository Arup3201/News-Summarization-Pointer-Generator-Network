She may be generous and polite, but police in Oklahoma City say that will not save a robbery suspect they're calling the 'tipping bandit' from prison. 

Investigators are appealing to the public for help in apprehending a woman who is accused of robbing the same Subway eatery at gunpoint twice less than a week apart. 

According to police, during the first stick-up in mid-January, the female suspect walked up to a clerk at the Subway at 6900 North May Avenue, pulled out a handgun and demanded that she hand over all of the cash from the register.

Caught on video: Surveillance cameras inside a Subway eatery in Oklahoma City captured a woman dressed in black pulling a gun on a cashier and demanding she hand over all the cash 

Repeat offense: The January 28 incident that was caught on camera came less than a week after the robber held up the same eatery and left a $1 for the Subway staffer working the counter

About a week later, on January 28, the unidentified woman returned to the same fast-food restaurant.

After being handed a wad of bills, she retreated, but not before thanking her victim.
