Peter Moores has given the biggest backing yet for Alastair Cook to carry on as England’s one-day captain for the World Cup while rounding on the critics who continue to seek to undermine him.

England’s coach was in combative mood at the end of his first season back in charge as he was again asked about the position of a captain who continually has to justify himself in some quarters as both a player and leader.

‘Alastair is a very fine one-day player but nobody wants to talk about that,’ said Moores after England’s thrilling Twenty20 victory over India to complete the international season.

‘They want to say he’s out of form or talk about whatever he’s not doing right. I think it’s harsh criticising him as a player.

‘He has shown an enormous amount of fortitude to go through some of the criticism he’s had despite being the player he is. All players go through highs and lows. He’s had a tough time and come through the Test series by scoring runs.

‘He would have loved to have gone on and scored hundreds in the one-day series but he’s still scored more hundreds than any other England player since the last World Cup.

'He’s scored four to everybody else’s two and five in all. He’s still in the top 10 runscorers in the world since the last World Cup.’

Moores said after England lost the one-day series 3-1 to India that nobody’s place was safe and Sportsmail understands the coach and selectors will consider three or four changes to the squad that will play in Sri Lanka in November.

Yet as far as Moores is concerned Cook’s place is clearly not in doubt.

‘What I said was absolutely clear,’ said Moores. ‘We are going to sit and look at every position, which is right because we’ve got to pick an England team to win a World Cup.

'It would be wrong not to look robustly at every player in that team to make sure we do it right.

‘Alastair has worked extremely hard with the young players coming in and I like the way he has done that, I really do. But it would be wrong for me to start saying now that this is our captain and this is our side.’

The selectors plan a series of meetings culminating in picking a squad for the seven-match series in Sri Lanka on September 23. ‘I will go into that meeting and I will have my view,’ said Moores.

‘It’s pretty clear. I’ve got a huge amount of respect for Alastair as a player and captain and I think the questioning of him has been unjust.

'You can hear pretty clearly how I feel about Alastair Cook but I am one of four selectors and this is me being fair to the other three. I will listen to all views then we will do what we think is right.’

England’s tactics have been criticised by some as being out-dated but Moores is adamant that the problems against India were more to do with not executing plans properly rather than any weaknesses of strategy.

‘I don’t think the strategy is that complicated,’ said Moores. ‘You need people up front to bat well and go on. They increase their scoring rate the longer they are in and there’s areas you have to be good at.

'We’ve got to be able to find the ropes against spinners in the middle overs and we have to set up the batters who can strike at the end of the innings.’

England will give their players a break before they step up their one-day preparation ahead of that World Cup which starts against Australia in Melbourne on February 14.

‘This is quite an opportunity for us,’ said Moores. ‘Now we’ve got to pick an England team to win a World Cup.’

And that team looks sure to have Cook at the helm.
