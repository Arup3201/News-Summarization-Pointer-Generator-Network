Sinan Inan, 33, is accused of sexually assaulting a 21-year-old woman in his barber's shop. He denies the allegation

A hairdresser massaged a customer's breasts after giving her a cut and blow dry because he wanted to improve his skills before opening a massage parlour, a court has heard.

The horrified 21-year-old victim was looking for a trim when she entered Sinan Inan's Elite Men's Barber Shop in July last year, but was offered a massage as part of the deal.

The woman, who cannot be named, told Bristol Crown Court that Inan, 33, moved his hands 'under her bra' after moving on from her shoulders.

She said: 'He went from my shoulders to my chest, lower and lower until he was in my bra, on my boobs.

'He was using all of his hands on my chest. He was behind me, doing a circular motion under my bra.

'I thought the whole situation was a bit weird. He was getting lower and lower and lower.

'I knew as soon as he started feeling my boobs the line was crossed. That's when I knew something was wrong.'

Inan offered a massage to the woman after telling her that he planned to open a parlour above his shop in Downend, Bristol, the court was told.

The woman said she did not want to turn down Inan's offer of a massage as she did not want to seem rude.

CCTV footage played to the jury appeared to show Inan moving his hands from the woman's shoulders and neck and down her top.

The woman said: 'I was shocked. How do you get away from someone standing over you like that?

'I was scared. I knew something was wrong. I was in shock for days.

'I didn't know how to get out of the situation.'

Inan, who denies sexual assault, told the court that the woman asked him why a haircut would cost £11. 

He replied that a lot could be included such as a hair wash.

After the hair cut he offered to massage her.

The woman told the court that she entered Elite Men's Barber Shop, in Downend, Bristol, looking for a trim

Speaking through a Turkish interpreter, he said: 'She was very happy.

'The massage produces endorphin hormones and they keep you happy.

'Rather than being in shock, you come out from the shock.'

Inan, from Fishponds, Bristol, told the court the woman had said she felt sleepy and that when he asked her if it was hurting she said it did not.

He added: 'She didn't tell me to stop massaging her. She didn't show any displeasure. It was the other way around.' 

The trial continues.
