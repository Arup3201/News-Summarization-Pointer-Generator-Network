China has said Britain
has no authority or moral responsibility for what happens in Hong Kong post-1997, in the latest shot fired in a diplomatic row between the nations that has escalated since the weekend.

The war of words kicked off on Sunday when a group of British MPs, who were set to visit Hong Kong on a research mission regarding the progress towards democracy later this month, were refused entry.

Prime Minister David Cameron sharply criticised that decision, saying it heightened concerns about the situation in the former British colony. 

Long fight: British MPs had applied for visas to Hong Kong to investigate regarding the progress towards democracy which has seen 'Occupy' protests in the city for two months

'His view is that the decision with regard to the foreign affairs committee is a mistaken one,' David Cameron's spokesperson said.

'It's counter productive because it only serves to amplify concerns about the situation in Hong Kong, rather than diminishing concerns.' 

The British parliament held a three-hour emergency debate
over the ban on Tuesday, with members warning it would damage
relations between London and Beijing. 

Today, China responded to the critique from Cameron and Parliament, saying that Britain has no responsibility for Hong Kong after returning the city to Chinese rule.

The 'one country, two systems' formula that was agreed in 1997, allowed Hong Kong to keep wide-ranging freedoms and autonomy. 

Marking territory: Beijing said today that Britain has 'no sovereignty, no authority and no right to oversight' in Hong Kong post-1997

New move: A group of Occupy Central demonstrators hold signs outside the Central Police Station in Sheung Wan, Hong Kong on Wednesday

Giving in: Benny Tai Yiu-ting, Chan Kin-man and Reverend Chu yiu-ming, the three co-founders of Occupy Central movement, surrender themselves in to the police today

'Britain has no sovereignty over a Hong Kong that has
returned to China, no authority and no right to oversight. There
is no such thing as a moral responsibility,' Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said today.

'The real aim of a small minority of British people trying
to use so-called moral responsibility to obscure the facts is to
interfere in China's internal affairs. 

'Such an attempt cannot
succeed, and is something China certainly cannot accept.' 

Moves by Beijing to control nominations for a 2017 vote for
Hong Kong's leader have prompted the weeks of protests. 

Today, after two months of civil action in central Hong Kong, the three founders of the Occupy Central movement handed themselves over to police.

Benny Tai, Chan Kin-man and Chu Yiu-ming surrendered this morning while dozens of supporters, many carrying the yellow umbrellas that have become a symbol of the movement, gathered outside the police station in central Hong Kong.

However, despite admitting to the crime of 'participating in unauthorised assembly', the trio were not arrested and soon emerged from the police station to cheers from protesters. 

'We have not been arrested so we are allowed to leave with no restriction on our liberty,' Benny Tai said.

He added there were 'political considerations' behind their swift release to avoid crowds flocking to the protest zones, but said it was inevitable they would eventually be arrested.

'I don't think the matter will be resolved on this occasion, later we may be arrested, even prosecuted for more serious offences,' Tai added.
