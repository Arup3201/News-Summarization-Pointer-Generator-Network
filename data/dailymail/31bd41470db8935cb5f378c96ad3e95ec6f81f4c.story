Near Death Experience:  Mary Neal (photographed) claims that she died and went to heaven where she was forewarned of her son's death 

A Wyoming surgeon claims that she experienced heaven and was  forewarned of her son's tragic death during a near-death experience.

On June 21, 2009, Dr. Mary Neal, of Wyoming, learned that her son, Willie, was in an accident. The 19-year-old was roller skiing when he was hit from behind by a distracted driver in a vehicle and killed, Bangor Daily News reports.

That was the day Neal finished the memoir about her own near-death experience, one in which she  claims she was warned about her son's death a decade earlier.

In 1999, Neal, an orthopedic spine surgeon, was kayaking in southern Chile with her husband, Bill, and their friends when she became pinned under a waterfall where she was trapped for 12 minutes, according to the Huffington Post.

Tom Long, a friend and EMT who was with Neal when she drowned, spoke with Jonas Elrod on 'In Deep Shift with Jonas Elrod,' a series on the Oprah Winfrey Network, and told Elrod that after 90 seconds under water, Neal couldn't have been breathing anymore.

'I don't know what happened,' Long said. 'We're 24 minutes into it; she's dead. Blue, waxy, no heartbeat, no breathing, cold-to-the-touch dead.' 

Miraculously, the mother-of-three was able to be resuscitated and suffered no brain damage, the Post reports.

After going without oxygen for nearly 30 minutes, Neal regained consciousness, and when she did, she had a story to tell: she had gone to heaven. 

'I could feel my spirit peeling away from my body,' Neal said, describing her time under the water. 'I rose up and out of the water and I was immediately greeted by a group of people, beings, spirits.'

Son: Neal said that during her time in heaven, she was warned about the future death of her oldest son, Willie (photographed)

Neal told Elrod that the 'spirits' were overjoyed as they welcomed her. She equated it to the feeling of returning home after a long voyage. 

In the episode, Elrod asked what heaven was like and she said there was no other earthly equivalent.

'The senses were different. I mean the beauty was incredibly intense..' Neal said. 

Neal did not want to leave, she told Elrod, but the spirits, who she said had heads, arms, legs, and were wearing robes, told her that it wasn't her time, and that she had to go back because she had work to do -- she was told that she was to share her experience with people. 

Warning: Neal said that the spirits did not tell her the date or the time it would happen, but warned her of Willie's death

Willie: On June 21, 2009, Willie, 19,  died after a distracted driver struck him from behind while he was roller skiing

Neal said the spirits then reunited her with her body and she wrote in her memoir 'To Heaven and Back' that the spirits warned her of a future tragedy.

'They did tell me about the future death of my oldest son,' she said in the episode. 'They didn't tell me the date or the time, but it was very clear that would be happening.'

And ten years later it did. 

'I woke up every day hoping the plan for my son's life would change,' Neal said.

Overjoyed: Neal said that the 'spirits' were overjoyed as they welcomed her. She equated it to the feeling of returning home after a long voyage

She said that she didn't share the news with her husband at the time because 'it was a burden.' 

On the anniversary of his death, Neal wrote about her son in a post on her Facebook page. She wrote that she is grateful for the time she spent with Willie, who would be about 24 or 25 now.

'Your smile, your spirit, and your light continue to permeate the darkness...' she wrote. 'Thank you for the little ways in which you have shown us you are still around.'

Neal, a woman of science, was caught between two conflicting ideas. She said she wondered if the situation could be explained scientifically, or if it was a miracle, according to the episode.

Children: Neal once had four children, (from left to right) Betsy, Peter, Willie, and Eliot Neal

She said she studied dreams, hallucinations, and what happens when the brain dies. Neal said she needed to figure out what she experienced.

'We want to find an explanation that we can understand, other than something that is divine,' Neal told Elrod. 

'I am a very concrete thinker, I'm not fanciful, I don't exaggerate. At the end my conclusion was that, no, it really was beyond science. 

'I absolutely know what I know. It was pretty absolute for me.'  

Memoir: In 2012, Neal released her memoir, 'To Heaven and Back: A Doctor's Extraordinary Account of Her Death, Heaven, Angels, and Life Again: A True Story'
