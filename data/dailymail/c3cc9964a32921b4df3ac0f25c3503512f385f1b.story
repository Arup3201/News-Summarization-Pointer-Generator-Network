If you want to know what Amsterdammers are really like, you could do a lot worse than chat to Iris. There she was, a little girl on a stool in grassy Vondelpark. It was King’s Day, the Saturday in April when the city turns orange because everyone’s just happy to be Dutch.

Later in the day there is music, dancing and vast amounts of drink. But King’s Day morning belongs to the children, encouraged by parents everywhere to learn the Dutch habits of entrepreneurship: playing music, selling old toys, making cakes – doing what it takes to earn money, because when they grow up that’s what the Dutch do.

Iris sat there with her crayons and easel and offered to sketch a quick portrait for 50 cents. But, as her portfolio proudly demonstrated, she couldn’t draw for toffee. All she had were funny, childlike scribbles.

Hugely individual: Author David Hewson says to find the real Amsterdam simply venture out of the city centre

The King’s Day crowds simply laughed, queued up for a truly terrible likeness, then gave her a whole euro for her cheek.

Forget coffee shops, the sleaze and tourist tat with clogs and tulips. This is the real Amsterdam, a bright, funny, extraordinarily human place with odd local customs and a huge sense of individual identity.

To find it, all you have to do is walk away from the centre.

Historic Amsterdam, that old part you first see when you turn up at Centraal Station, may have its monuments but it’s also the most tawdry and overcrowded part of the city.

The real city, the place of painters and poets and dreamers, lies elsewhere, in the watery girdle known as the Canal Rings, the elegant Museum District, and the Jordaan, the old working-class area turning into one of the chic-est parts of town. Here you realise it’s impossible to separate Amsterdam from the written word: Anne Frank penned her memoirs in a little house on the Prinsengracht canal, hiding from the Nazis; John Green’s fated lovers in The Fault In Our Stars brave the perpetual tedious queue for the cramped museum her house has now become.

People relax by the famous canal of Amsterdam, a city far more elegant and chic than it's given credit for 

An extraordinary doll’s house in the Rijksmuseum lies at the heart of Jessie Burton’s The Miniaturist. The same object is an obsession for the Amsterdam detective Pieter Vos in my crime story The House Of Dolls.

Here, then, are my top five sights for a lazy, pleasurable break that combines sightseeing with a taste for the real city…

Once rough and working class, as depicted in this work, Neighborhood in the Jordaan by George Hendrik Breitner, Jordaan is trendy and bustling

Dawdling in the Jordaan

Pieter Vos popped into my imagination a few years ago as I was sipping a beer in the De Eland cafe – reimagined in the book as the Drie Vaten – watching the world go by. That’s what you do in the Jordaan.

Once a rough working-class area, its narrow streets now house a bustling and increasingly trendy community of small cafes, and scores of tiny, busy restaurants.

Stand outside De Eland, on the Berenstraat Bridge over the Prinsengracht, and you see what real Amsterdam life is like.

Boats large and small shuttle up and down the canals. In winter the locals pop into a little shop at the Elandsgracht end to feast on stampotje, a kind of Dutch bubble-and-squeak. In summer the same shop transforms itself, with that typical Amsterdam sense of business, into an ice-cream parlour.

There are bikes everywhere, of course – on the pavement, in the road, some with dogs in shopping baskets up front; a habit my Amsterdam detective follows too. From here you can walk to the Anne Frank house in five minutes, if you want to spend the next hour in a queue. I’ve never made it inside.

My local friends spend their time in De Negen Straatjes, the Nine Streets that make up the city’s most interesting shopping district, where you can buy everything from gourmet cheese to designer clothes.

The old Jordaan hasn’t gone entirely, though. Ask for a music cafe and you’ll still find places where locals sing ‘the Dutch blues’ – folk music – of an evening. The tunes are an acquired taste but the experience of being there among a beery bar of singers is something you won’t find anywhere else.

The wonder of the Begijnhof

This is a busy, brash city but hidden away in its heart is a quiet oasis of extraordinary calm. The Begijnhof is a courtyard of ancient houses tucked behind the bustle of Spui Square (pronounced ‘Spow’, as in ‘cow’, by the way). 

This was a community for single Catholic women, and walking into it is like shrugging off the centuries. The last member of the ‘Beguines’, a lay Catholic female order, died in 1971 but it’s still a place reserved for single women, so do treat with care. See the charming little chapel too, then step back out into the real world.

Culture at the Rijksmuseum

A 15-minute walk away is one of the greatest museums in the world, now reopened after long closure for refurbishment.

The doll’s house of Petronella Oortman, which features in both The House Of Dolls and The Miniaturist, is just one of many famous exhibits. Perhaps the best-known is Rembrandt’s vast canvas, The Night Watch.

There’s often a queue so buy your ticket in advance through your hotel or through the museum at rijksmuseum.nl/en/tickets. Don’t expect to see everything: the place is much too big for that. Stick with the big sights, the paintings and dolls’ houses, and leave the rest for another time.

Amsterdam’s Schiphol is one of the busiest airports in the world, with services from many UK main and regional airports by KLM, British Airways and easyJet, among others.

You can also get fast trains from London St Pancras to Centraal Station via Brussels Midi on Eurostar and Thalys in less than five hours.

Banks Mansion is a handsome boutique hotel on the Herengracht canal, within walking distance of the centre, the museum district and the Jordaan. Staff are happy to book museum tickets and local transport. Rooms start at £150 per night for two and include breakfast and a selection of drinks and snacks throughout the day.

Ambassade Hotel is set in a number of old houses along the Herengracht. From about €200 a night, this is the place where authors generally stay in Amsterdam and has a small library full of signed copies to prove it.

Hotel Weichmann is one of the few hotels in the Jordaan. Set on the Prinsengracht, it’s a small and popular family-run hotel with rooms from about £103 a night.

De Oude Kerk – and red lights

Most visitors to Amsterdam will wander into the red-light district out of sheer curiosity. The narrow streets are mostly safe day and night – just don’t try to take pictures of the women working in the windows.

We don’t know exactly where Petronella Oortman lived but we are sure it was in Warmoesstraat, a very old and narrow thoroughfare that runs from near Centraal Station all the way to busy Dam Square. It’s well worth a walk for the odd pretty view and the old-fashioned fish and cheese shops that work next to the more modern establishments.

The 13th Century Oude Kerk is the oldest building in the city. It’s massive and not exactly elegant, but interesting, with a quiet cafe and garden. Coffee shops, sex parlours and other louche establishments line the neighbouring streets, but the canals are still pretty. Walk on to Zeedijk, then up to the smart open square of Nieuwmarkt and you’ve left the red-light district behind.

A coffee at the old city gatehouse of the Waag here is a pleasant stop. Rembrandt knew this place, and his famous gory canvas The Anatomy Lesson depicts a real-life dissection of an executed criminal that took place in the anatomy theatre – now closed – at the top of the Waag.

A taste of the real Holland

Edam and Gouda are genuine Dutch cheeses, but the real thing is a lot less bland than the varieties most of us experience in the UK. Food in Amsterdam is incredibly varied, from local to French, Italian and many Indonesian restaurants offering Rijsttafel, elaborate banquets of tiny dishes.

Dutch Edam and Gouda cheeses taste far richer than the bland versions we're so often served up 

Some of the best food is cheap, simple and available on the street. Amsterdammers adore chips and will queue patiently for a cone at their favourite friteshuis, soaked in a piquant sauce. Cheese shops often make delicious sandwiches on the spot – try Kaashuis Tromp in Elandsgracht for some of the best freshly cooked cheese croissants you’ll ever taste.

On Saturdays the Jordaan area around Lindengracht and neighbouring Noordermarkt are taken over with market stalls from all over Holland selling a wonderful selection of cheese, fish, bread, fruit and home-made produce.

If you really want to go local, try one of the herring stalls in the street. The taste of fresh salty fish and sharp onion – in a bread bun if you must – will remind you of this charming and often misunderstood city for ever.
