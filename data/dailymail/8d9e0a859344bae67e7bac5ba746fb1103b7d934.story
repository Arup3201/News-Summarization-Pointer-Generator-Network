Cornwall’s ruined tin mines have been named among the world’s 27 ‘must see places before you die’ by a top US broadcaster.

Perched on the cliff edge near St Just, Penzance, the mines, have been chosen alongside the likes of the Northern Lights, Sydney Harbour and the Taj Mahal as a must-see destination.

The ruins of the structures which once housed the mining machinery are a 'dramatic counterpoint' to the rugged rocks and wild seas of Cornwall’s north coast, according to the list by CNN.

Beauty: Count House at Botallack, at St Just, Cornwall is one of the 
most stunning locations and stands on the cliffs of the Crowns Mine. It 
was the hub of the day-to-day running of the mine in the 1860s

English charm: Towanroath Engine House at Wheal Coates Mine is a stone's throw to the rugged Cornish coast

Amazing: Topping the list is Borobudur at sunrise in Java, Indonesia while the Cornish mines came in at 27

Around 3,000 engine houses were built in the 18th and 19th centuries but the last closed in the 1930s and the remains were declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2006.

Visitors can walk heritage trails, go 
underground to see how the miners laboured, pan for minerals and gems or
bike the 31-kilometre Cornwall Mineral Tramway trail.

Count House at Botallack at St Just is one of the most stunning locations and stands on the cliffs of the Crowns Mine. It was the hub of the day-to-day running of the mine and was also where the miners collected their pay.

Nature: Witnessing a starling murmuration at Brighton Pier made number two in the CNN list

Stunning: The Northern Lights in Scandinavia (pictured) is in third 
place followed closely by the great migration in East Africa

CNN said: 'The tin mines may be 
closed, but the ruins of the structures which once housed them near St 
Just make a thrillingly dramatic counterpoint to the rugged rocks and 
wild seas of Cornwall’s north coast.'

The mines are among three places in Britain which made the list, just scraping in at number 27.

Witnessing a starling murmuration at Brighton Pier made number two in the list, while the Lake District made it at number 24.

Topping the list is Borobudur at sunrise in Java, Indonesia, with the Brighton starlings a close second.

Third is the Northern Lights in Scandinavia, followed closely by the great migration in East Africa.

The fifth and six spot is filled by the star-filled sky, in New Zealand and the Torres del Paine in Chile.

Morocco’s Djemaa el Fna is in seventh place and California’s Yosemite peaks is the eight must see place to see before death.

Number
nine is Santa Maria della Salute in Venice, the Jungle pyramids in 
Mexico is number ten and 11 is the electrical storm in Tornado Alley, 
USA.

The famous Sydney Harbour comes in at 12, with the inside of Thrihnukagigur volcano in Iceland at 13.

Number 14 is Monument Valley in the US and 15 is India’s Taj Mahal.

The Kasanka bat migration in Zambia, 
Carlsbad Cavern in America, Lunar rainbow in Zambia and Shubenacadie 
tidal bore in Canada take the 16,17,18 and 19 spots.

Cape
Tribulation in Australia, Rock Face City of Petra in Jordan, Enrosadira
in Italy and Fairy Chimneys in Turkey take up the spots from 20 to 23.

England’s Lake District is at 24, with the Sardine run in South Africa at 25.

The last two spaces are filled 
by the pristine beaches of Islas Cies in Spain and finally, Cornwall’s 
ruined mines come in at 27.

CNN
said: 'There are some things you can see around the world that have the
potential to give you photo-showing rights for decades.

'We
haven’t got them all - in fact we barely scratched the surface. But we 
have picked out a few of the scenes that, if you’re lucky enough to 
witness them, will invariably leave you spellbound.'
