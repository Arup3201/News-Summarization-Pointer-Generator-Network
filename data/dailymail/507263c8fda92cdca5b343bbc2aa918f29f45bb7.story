Anna Soubry said the Coalition was not on course to meet a pledge to cut annual arrivals below 100,000 by next year

A Tory minister has admitted the Government is likely to miss its target to slash immigration after a huge surge in the number of foreign workers.

Anna Soubry said the Coalition was not on course to meet a pledge to cut annual arrivals below 100,000 by next year.

Figures showed an extra 292,000 people born overseas found jobs in Britain in the 12 months to March this year.

It included a huge number from Poland and other ex-Eastern Bloc countries that joined the EU in May 2004.

The total employed from those countries was 802,000 – an increase of 115,000 compared to a year ago.

An extra 29,000 Romanians and Bulgarians were also at work here, while more than 20,000 of the 292,000 total came from western European countries such as Italy.

And there were an extra 124,000 born outside the EU who found jobs in the UK in the last 12 months, taking that total to 2.8million.

The Office for National Statistics figures made a massive dent in David Cameron’s 2010 election promise to reduce the number of newcomers.

On Tuesday, the Prime Minister conceded to senior MPs he had not brought immigration down as much as he would have liked despite it being a key concern among voters.

Yesterday Miss Soubry, a defence minister, said: ‘At the moment we don’t seem to be on course.’

But she insisted on Radio 4’s World At One programme that Number 10’s pledge had been aimed at illegal immigrants rather than those with the right to travel to the UK to work.

She said: ‘It was actually about a large number of people who were here who definitely should not be here.’

Her stance was attacked by opponents. Labour immigration spokesman David Hanson said: ‘The Prime Minister promised no ifs, no buts, that he would get net migration down, yet under his government he has missed his own self-selected target.’

Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said the Government had to do more ‘to address people’s legitimate concerns’.

She said: ‘Ministers aren’t doing enough to stop employers and agencies exploiting cheap migrant labour, particularly from Eastern Europe, to undercut wages and jobs.’

Ukip leader Nigel Farage said immigrants were driving down wages. He said: ‘Britain is becoming the cheap labour economy and I don’t think that is really socially a very desirable place for us to be.’

Mr Cameron, who is enjoying a poll boost because of the burgeoning economy, will hope the figures will not undermine his message on the doorstep and rile Right-wing Tories with the general election just a year away.

He received support from veteran Conservative MP Nicholas Soames who warned that the party was packed with too many Eurosceptics.

He compared the anti-European debate to that around capital punishment when he first sought election in the late 1970s.

He said: ‘In those days the litmus test on the Right of the Tory party was hanging. If you weren’t pro-hanging you wouldn’t get selected.

‘Well now the litmus test is Europe. If you are not very Eurosceptic and prepared to go along with the more strongly held, but I think eccentric views, of some of these Conservative associations, you won’t get selected. That’s a great pity.’
