The U.S President and the First Lady 
both covered thousands of miles between them yesterday, targeting the 
rich during their busy fundraising campaign.

Michelle Obama spoke to an audience of 300 supporters at a downtown Cincinnati hotel saying President Obama’s work 'is not done,' while her husband held a glitzy fundraiser at  the home of Dallas Mavericks guard Vince Carter where about 70 guests gathered for a $30,000-a-person event.

'If any family in this country is struggling, we can not be satisfied with our own families’ good fortune,' said the First Lady, who spoke before an audience at the Westin Hotel who had paid anywhere from $250 to $10,000 for the mid-day event.

struggling, we can not be satisfied with our own families’ good 
fortune,' said the First Lady, who spoke before an audience at the

Praise: At the hotel fundraiser, Michelle Obama was introduced by Cincinnati Mayor Mark Mallory,far left, who called her 'a woman of poise, a woman of elegance, a woman of grace, and, I would say, a woman of intelligence'

Mrs Obama spoke for nearly half an 
hour to the people in the ballroom, having already appeared at a private
reception with big donors, and offering attendees the chance to have a photo taken with her.

She was introduced by Cincinnati Mayor Mark Mallory, who called her 'a woman of poise, a woman of elegance, a woman of grace, and, I would say, a woman of intelligence.'

She told the audience that her husband, raised by a single parent, with the help of his grandmother,  understands the problems of struggling families 'because he has lived them.'

She praised the passage of health care reform legislation that she said has already 'saved millions of seniors in this country an average of $600 a year for prescription drugs.”

On the road: Before his fundraising blitz, Obama spoke to a campaign-like crowd at the University of Miami to defend his energy policy in the midst of spiking gasoline prices

Predictions: He told the crowd that his Republican rivals would offer nothing but more drilling and political promises of $2-a-gallon gas

'Now, there are some folks talking about repealing that reform,’’ Mrs. Obama said. 'Are we going to let that happen?  Are we going to allow children to be denied health care coverage who have cancer or other serious diseases? We can’t do that.”

She also praised President Obama for getting rid of the 'Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell’ policy toward gays in the military as well as encouraging supporters in the crowd to go to work for the re-election campaign.

'Will be let everything we worked for just slip away?,' she asked.

It was Mrs Obama’s first visit to Cincinnati since 2008, when her husband was running for president.

Meanwhile her President Barack Obama held a glitzy fundraiser at  the home of Dallas Mavericks guard Vince Carter where about 70 guests gathered for a $30,000-a-person event.

Mourning, right, and Chris Paul of the Los Angeles Clippers

Home at last: Mr Obama returns home late last night following the day trip to Miami and Orlando

Among those invited were former L.A. 
Lakers star Earvin 'Magic' Johnson, former Miami Heat star Alonzo 
Mourning and Chris Paul of the Los Angeles Clippers.

The event raised money from current and former NBA greats and an intimate group of supporters drawn to this weekend's All-Star game in nearby Orlando.

The group gathered in Carter's 
gymnasium, with the scoreboard showing 2012 on the clock and the score 
tied at 44, Obama being the 44th president.

'It's
a nice gym,' Obama observed, understatedly. 'Vince said he left the 
other side open in case I wanted to get in a dunk contest with him. I 
told him I didn't bring my sneakers, so not tonight.'

Obama
thanked NBA Commissioner David Stern, also in attendance, for resolving
the basketball lockout that delayed the start of the basketball season.

'I don't know what I would be doing with myself if I at least didn't have some basketball games around,' Obama said.

Public engagement together: Earlier this week President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama attended a ceremony for the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington

The fundraiser capped a day hauling in campaign cash, taunting Republicans and pushing his energy policy in the face of rising gasoline prices.

Yesterday's dinner was Mr Obama's third high-dollar Florida fundraiser of the day, including one at the swanky Biltmore Hotel in Coral Gables and a $10,000-a-ticket gathering at the Miami home of veteran fundraiser Chris Korge.

But he had more than the November election on his mind.

An avid basketball fan, the president also lamented missing Thursday night's highly anticipated NBA matchup in South Florida between the Miami Heat and the New York Knicks - including the Knicks' emerging superstar, Jeremy Lin.

'I'm resentful I'm not going to the game tonight. I'm mad about that,' Obama joked. 'It's not right. It's not fair.'

'We've got a good story to tell about the last three years, but I'm not done here,' the president said. 'I need five more years.'

Last week, Obama took a three-day West Coast trip and raised about $8 million in eight campaign events.

Before his fundraising blitz, Obama spoke to a campaign-like crowd at the University of Miami to defend his energy policy in the midst of spiking gasoline prices.

He predicted his Republican rivals would offer nothing but more drilling and political promises of $2-a-gallon gas.

'That's not a plan, especially since we're already drilling,' he said. 'That's a bumper sticker.'

His trip to Florida came as gasoline has reached the highest price at the pump ever for this time of year: an average of $3.58 per gallon. White House advisers see it as a cyclical occurrence but knew Obama had to address the topic, one of deep concern to consumers and growing fodder for Republicans seeking to unseat Obama.
