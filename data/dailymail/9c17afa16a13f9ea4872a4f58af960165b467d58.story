Gold Coast masseuse Arshareeya Wajadee says she's sick of male clients who expect an extra hands-on experience

A qualified traditional Thai masseuse has repeatedly had her business mistaken for a house of pleasure by prospective male clients.

Very much to the point where she's been forced to add 'no sexual services' on the pricing menu of her Thai massage parlour business in Gold Coast, southeastern Queensland.

Owner Arshareeya Wajadee says her genuine business is being mistaken for illegal brothels and she isn't alone, reported Gold Coast Bulletin.

Other therapists say they receive calls every week from male clients who ask for a happy ending.

A nearby parlour, across the road from Ms Wajadee's Sabai Traditional Thai Massage and Spa, erected a two metre sign in their shop front.

'Please Read!!! Strictly NO sexual services. Please Do Not Ask Anymore!' it reads.

In some instances, wives request to have the curtain open when their husbands go in for a massage in order to monitor both the masseuse and partner.

Ms Wajadee says she has a firm policy against sexual services at her workplace.

'Everyone here knows that if they're asked to say "get out",' she told Gold Coast Bulletin.

'I'm very strong with that. Everyone here is fully qualified in original Thai massage.'

Gold Coast councillor Margaret Grummit says Australians automatically associate massage parlours as brothels and perhaps some education is required.

Ms Wajadee hopes with some government intervention, laws can be changed to protect therapists from sexual harassment in the workplace.
