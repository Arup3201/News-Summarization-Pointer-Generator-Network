The teenager who stabbed his teacher to death in a brutal classroom killing is getting 'fanmail' from deluded youngsters, it emerged today.

Mixed-up teenagers have gone online to praise Will Cornick, the murderer of Spanish teacher Ann Maguire, and he is reportedly being sent letters from admiring peers.

Some youngsters have even used the term 'good times' - the words uttered by Cornick in the moments after his horrific attack - as a sickening catchphrase.

Cornick, 16, has been jailed for a minimum of 20 years for the murder of the popular teacher at Corpus Christi College in Leeds in April this year.

But a Facebook group set up in his name has seen some teenage girls claim they find the 16-year-old killer attractive.

After website users attacked Cornick, one girl wrote: 'Calm down. I love Will!!!' in a comment that was then 'liked' by a friend.

In another 'liked' comment, a schoolgirl wrote: 'He's so buff.' When asked what she meant, she replied: 'Good looking.'

One girl even repeated the phrase Cornick used after he stabbed his teacher, writing  'good times' on the page, followed by a thumbs up symbol.

Again, her comment was 'liked' by others.

Cornick's own Facebook page (pictured) has been taken down, but 'community pages' with comments about him have sprung up since his sentencing

The killing, at Corpus Christi Catholic College in Leeds, shocked Britain and is believed to be the first time a teacher has been killed by a student in the classroom in the UK

Another message on the page comes from an Italian girl who is trying to get in contact with Cornick,  saying she feels 'sorry for' him and describing him as a 'friend'.

The online comments emerged as it was reported that Cornick has received messages from teenagers around the world as he begins his prison term.

The Daily Star quoted a source close to the case who claimed: 'He is getting letters from boys and girls from England, the US and Australia. Some are from girls saying he is cute and they want to marry him.'

Cornick was sentenced to life in jail earlier this month and a judge warned him he may never be released.

Judge Mr Justice Coulson called the murder a 'monumental act of cowardice and evil' and branded the teenager's pride and lack of remorse over his actions 'truly grotesque'.

Cornick was initially taken to Wetherby Young Offender Institution (YOI) in West Yorkshire before being moved for his own safety.
