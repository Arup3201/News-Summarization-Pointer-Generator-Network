The mystery movie fan who paid nearly $1 million for the underwater car featured in Bond film The Spy Who Loved Me has been revealed as Tesla Motors chief executive Elon Musk.

The businessman behind the electric car company bought the Lotus at RM Auction in London last month and said he plans to turn the prop into a working submarine car.

With an estimated fortune of $6.7 billion and a pioneering car company that created the Tesla Roadster, Mr Musk is well placed to take on the role of M and turn the Lotus into a real James Bond device.

Dream car: Musk has been fascinated by the car from The Spy Who Loved Me since he first saw the film

Mr Musk confessed to being obsessed with the Lotus-based submarine from the moment he first saw Bond, played by Roger Moore, dive under the sea in the car.

'It was amazing as a little kid in South
 Africa to watch James Bond in "The Spy Who Loved Me" drive his Lotus 
Esprit off a pier, press a button and have it transform into a submarine
 underwater,' Mr Musk told NBC News.

'I was 
disappointed to learn that it can't actually transform. What I'm going 
to do is upgrade it with a Tesla electric powertrain and try to make it 
transform for real.'

Prop: In the film several versions of the car were created to show each stage of its transformation

In the 1977 film, Moore escapes an 
attacking helicopter by driving off a pier. Fins replace the car's 
wheels and, with the touch of a button, a rocket blasts his pursuers 
from the sky.

The film makers used several Lotus car bodies for the film, each at a different stage of transformation.

The version now owned by Mr Musk is the Esprit submarine which was operated by a stunt double wearing scuba gear. 

Mr Musk is clearly a fan of Lotus cars. 
As well as the Bond prop, which came from an Esprit, the Tesla Roadster 
was styled on the Elise.

Aside from saying he wants to get the car working, Mr Musk has not revealed whether the car will be able to drive on land as well as underwater.

But with the car's new owner being behind several ground-breaking technological projects, including a plan to launch commuters to major cities through tubes, traveling at the speed of sound, it shouldn't be long before Mr Musk is enjoying a submerged drive.
