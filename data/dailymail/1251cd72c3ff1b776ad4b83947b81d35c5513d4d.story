The work of the 49-year-old former model was beloved by celebrities keen to walk the red carpet in her flattering designs.

Mad Men actress Christina Hendricks and Oscar winners Reese Witherspoon and Sandra Bullock were also fans of the celebrated designer.

Many of them have been vocal in their praise for the designer and the boost her clothes gave to their sex appeal.

'L'Wren and I have been dear friends for years now,' Nicole Kidman told the Telegraph in 2011. 'She knows what aspects to accentuate in a woman, and is able to make you feel incredibly sexy and sophisticated when you are in one of her exquisite designs.'

Meanwhile Christina Hendricks, famed for her voluptuous curves said: 'L'Wren's clothes make you feel like a sexy pin-up, a sophisticated lady and a rockstar all at once. She designs for how women want to look and for what men want to look at.'

L'Wren Scott was even rumoured to have been at the forefront of the showbiz wedding of the year by designing Jolie's wedding dress for when she ties the knot with Brad Pitt.

Born in Utah as Laura Barnbrough, after her successful modelling career she later moved to L.A. to work as a stylist, working on fashion advertising campaigns and as a costume designer.

At the end of last year she launched a collaboration with Banana Republic, in which she starred alongside models in the adverts.

However she was forced to cancel her London Fashion Week show in February to reveal her Autumn/Winter 14 collection due to production issues.
