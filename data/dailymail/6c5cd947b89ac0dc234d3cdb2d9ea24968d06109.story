Newell's Old Boys defender Marcos Caceres suffered a horrific injury in his side's clash with Boca Juniors. 

The Paraguayan's left arm buckled underneath him in the 34th minute as he tried to challenge Boca's Juan Manuel Martinez, falling awkwardly in the process.  

The referee stopped the game with Caceres, 28, writhing on the floor in obvious agony and he was stretchered off with a dislocated elbow.

But it was not all bad new for Newell's as they went on to win the first game of the season 1-0 away from home in Boca's iconic La Bombonera. 

Teenager Mauricio Tevez - no relation to Boca legend Carlos - scored the only goal of the game on his Newell's debut.

Caceres' injury is reportedly not as bad as initially feared as the club await confirmation of how long he will be out of action.
