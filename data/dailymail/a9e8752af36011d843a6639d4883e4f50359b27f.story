She's the favourite to win the Best Actress Oscar for her role in Still Alice tonight but Julianne Moore is by no means just an actress.

In fact, the 54-year-old has written a series of children's books and is such an experienced interior designer that she's picked out the pieces decorating the green room at the Oscar ceremony itself.

However, in an interview with The Telegraph, she admitted her true life goal: 'I really wanted a family, I really wanted children and I didn't want to compromise on that.'

Julianne Moore (pictured on Saturday) counts interior design and children's fiction writing as just some of her outside passions, but the real thing that drives her is being a mother to her two children

Although she's struggled to balance work and family - calling it 'hell' at times - the actress, who plays a woman with early onset Alzheimer's in the highly praised film, said she has 'loved every minute' of motherhood.

Julianne has two children with director husband Bart Freundlich, Liv, 12, and Caleb, 17. 

The dream of a family was instilled in her from a young age by her mother, who died in 2009.

'She always told me that you can have both [career and family]. I think that it was important to realise what I valued, what I wanted, and to find a way to make them both happen,' she said.

Another thing Julianne inherited from her mother is an acute eye for interior design, which has been further enriched by her brother-in-law, architect Oliver Freundlich.

In fact, the Oscar nominee was even enlisted to select the furniture and decor for the green room backstage at the Oscars this year, a task that has previously been assigned to designers including David Rockwell, who teamed up with Susan Sarandon, and Madeline Stuart.

'[My mother] always told me that you can have both [career and family],' said Julianne (seen in January with son Caleb, daughter Liv and husband Bart Freundlich)

Julianne, who collaborated with Los Angeles-based design studio Commune on the design project, chose a Hollywood Hills theme, with the aim of making the room feel as if Joan Didion 'invited you over for a drink before the Oscars,' according to Roman Alonso, a partner at Commune.

She said her mother, who was Scottish, cared about where her family lived and made their houses look beautiful.  

'And that's something that I got from her and now I can see it in my daughter. I'm always fascinated by the urge to decorate. It doesn't seem to be a necessity and yet we've done it for centuries.' 

When she's not exercising her eye for design or spending quality time with her kids, Julianne also writes children's stories, including 2007 bestseller Freckleface Strawberry, about a young redhead girl finding confidence in a world full of blondes and brunettes.

Julianne is nominated for a best actress Oscar for her role in Still Alice, the story of a professor diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's at age 50, which hits UK theatres on March 6

She has another book, Backpacks, launching in July as part of a five-book contract with Random House.

With all these non-Hollywood skills and interests, it's easy to forget the reason why Julianne Moore is a household name in the first place - her three-decade-long acting career, for which she has earned five Oscar nominations, two Golden Globes and four BAFTA nods, among many more accolades.

But it's certainly not something she takes for granted. She recalled a conversation with her father who remarked that she'd been acting for 30 years.

Julianne said: 'I thought, oh my God, I feel lucky that it's gone on for that long and that I've had the experiences that I've had.'
