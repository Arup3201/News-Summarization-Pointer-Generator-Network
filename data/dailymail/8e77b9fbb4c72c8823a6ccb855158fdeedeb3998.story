These pictures show the crumbling concrete at the top of two newly-built tower blocks in China - amid claims they are starting to topple towards each other.

The 15-storey blocks were built in Shanghai, eastern China two years ago to offer accommodation to people relocated to make way for a Disney theme park.

But residents who live in the high-rise apartments, in the Pudong New Area in Chuansha Town, say the original narrow gap between the buildings has disappeared and they are now touching.

Some are afraid to go back in to their own homes after resident Qin Lijun, 34, went onto the roof to have a cigarette and discovered crumbling concrete. 

She said: 'I could see that the concrete was starting to crumble, I ran out of the building as fast as I could expecting it to fall down any minute, and called the emergency services. 

'But they refused to do anything, told me to speak to the property management company. They insisted it is safe, but I don't trust them. And neither does anybody else.'

Chen Tong, head of the engineering department at the Xintuan Real Estate company that maintains the properties and is responsible for them, denied there was a problem. 

He added: 'Only some decorative parts on the eaves were broken and residents can live in the blocks without any worries at all.'

Safety reports from an independent inspection on the buildings in question are due for release this week

However his remarks have done little to settle the fears of people who were promised they could settle in 'model' relocation homes.

Qin said: 'I have gone back but I haven't been able to sleep at all since. I keep expecting it to fall down.'
