It may not be a full-on invasion of killer sea monsters, but it's a start.

A rambler stood and watched as this dustbin-lid-shaped, 4ft long barrel jellyfish swam half a mile up a river estuary.

It is the latest sighting on the south coast of the huge but harmless creatures, which are usually found further out to sea and rarely come close to the shore.

And the coming summer weather means there could be many more on the way, according to experts.

Measuring 4ft from head to tentacle tip, the harmless jellyfish are often spotted away from the southern and western shores of the British Isles.

Wildlife cruise operators have already reported hundreds of the creatures off the coasts of Devon, Dorset and Cornwall.

But rambler David Smith, 45, photographed this jellyfish in a rare inland sighting as he visited Porth Sawsen beach near Falmouth.

He said: 'It looked at first like a giant blancmange sitting on the water. I took a closer look and realised it was one of those rare jellyfishes that are making the news.

They look like something from a horror film, but barrel jellyfish are the 'basking shark' of their species - enormous but harmless, feeding only on miniscule prey.

Often they are spotted from boats in the deeper waters of the English Channel, the Irish Sea and off the Outer Hebrides.

But it is rare for them to swim closer to the coast or inland, which is why recent sightings have made headlines.

And when the seas warm up in summer and autumn they breed at a phenomenal rate, creating huge swarms.

Beneath the dustbin lid-shaped bell are hundreds of tiny mouths ('pores'), each surrounded by tiny stinging tentacles to catch plankton.

The stings, however, are not strong enough to harm humans.

'I followed it about half a mile up the river before it eventually disappeared beneath the water. The thing moved at a snail’s pace so I was able to get a few photos before it vanished.'

Richard Harrington of the Marine Conservation Society said: 'Half a mile up an estuary is not too far as they are relatively strong swimmers, but it was more likely carried in then out again by the tide.

'This type of jellyfish is a regular visitor to the UK, although we’ve had reports of some very big ones this year.

'This is the only species of jellyfish that can live for more than one season, so these larger jellyfish are probably adults who have survived through the mild winter.'

The sighting comes days after several of the jellyfish washed up on beaches near Portland, Dorset.

Wildlife photographer Steve Trewhella, who picked up one of the animals, said: 'I think we will see more strandings because of the on-shore winds and the tides, but people should be careful not to touch them.'

The barrel jellyfish, Latin name rhizostoma pulmo, is not thought to be dangerous to humans.

Even so, beachgoers are advised not to touch any jellyfish in case they chance upon a species with a powerful sting.

Red Cross guidance says sting victims should not use urine to relieve the pain of a sting - because vinegar is far more effective.

Working out where jellyfish will swarm is a tricky business, but tourists will soon have a helping hand - from the Force, no less.

Marine biologists have launched a website called JeDI (Jellyfish Data Initiative) which maps swarms of the creatures and allows tourists to check their location.

In future, it could have a weather forecast-like feature to help people avoid getting stung.

The site draws on almost half a million sets of data on how many jellyfish there are in the uppermost 200 metres of the world’s seas.

It was created amid warnings that large numbers of the creatures can cause fish stocks to plummet.

The scientists found the greatest concentrations of jellyfish were in the mid latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, partly due to high levels of oxygen in the North Atlantic.

Dr Cathy Lucas, a marine biologist from the National Oceanography Centre in Southampton, said: 'People will be able to contribute their own data... It will be like a jellyfish version of Google Maps.

'We haven’t got a weather forecast feature yet as it’s just raw data but in the future we’re hoping to have something to help members of the public use the database.'

The huge jellyfish are usually found further out in the English Channel

They even have hundreds of tiny mouths (but are harmless to humans)
