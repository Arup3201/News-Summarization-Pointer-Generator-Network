Midsomer may have excluded black faces because 'it wouldn't be an English village with them’, but it seems that Oxford can accept a little more cultural diversity in its fictional crime fighters.

Prime-time ITV drama Lewis is bucking the trend for white-dominated leading roles in detective series with the introduction of a new character to be played by African actor Babou Ceesay.

Ceesay will play DC Alex Gray, who will be introduced to viewers this month, bringing a little more colour into the cast of the popular Oxford-set ITV programme.

Star of stage and screen: Babou Ceesay as Colonel Mburame in the play Bang Bang Bang. He will play Lewis's new sidekick in the eponymous ITV crime drama

It comes two years after the producer of Midsomer Murders was suspended for saying he did not cast black and Asian people in the series because he wanted to keep his programme 'the last bastion of Englishness'.

Gambian-born Ceesay, most recently seen in BBC4 sitcom Getting On, said he didn't believe his casting was a deliberate effort to bring more racial parity to the series.

'I don't think my role in Lewis is 
political,' he told the Observer. 'I don't think they were "going black"
for the part, as the industry phrase goes.'

And
there has been no attempt to tie his race into the narrative of the 
drama, the 34-year-old said, adding: 'The statement is that I am there 
and I am black.

'There is no need for them to say anything else.'

Leading man: Kevin Whately as Lewis. Ceesay said he did not believe his casting was a deliberate attempt to bring better racial parity to the series

ITV crime series have long been dominated by white characters, an unspoken prejudice made explicit two years ago when Brian True-May, producer of Midsomer Murders, said he wanted to keep ethnic minorities out of his programme.

'We are a cosmopolitan society in this country, but if you watch Midsomer you wouldn’t think so,' Mr True-May said in early 2011.

'I’ve never been picked up on that, but quite honestly I wouldn’t want to change it.

'We just don’t have ethnic minorities involved, because it wouldn’t be the English village then. It just wouldn’t work.

'Suddenly we might be in Slough.

'We’re the last bastion of Englishness and I want to keep it that way.'

Mr True-May was suspended, later announcing he was stepping down as executive producer. His replacement, Jo Wright, brought in Asian cast members Ace Bhatti and Soraya Radford to help the show 'represent its audience'.

Ceesay, who grew up in Africa, admitted that his race had affected the kinds of roles he was offered as he began his acting career in the UK.

But he said he had a 'slightly different view' of the problems faced by ethnic minority actors in the UK as black British actor David Harewood, star of Homeland, who said he had to go to the U.S. to land a major role.

'I do agree with him that the size of the industry out there makes a difference,' Ceesay said. 'But it is more competitive there, too.

'He was in a very big series, but I know several good black actors who are struggling out there.'
