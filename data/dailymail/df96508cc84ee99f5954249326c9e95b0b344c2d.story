A bout of shingles puts you at higher risk of having a stroke or heart attack years later, a study shows.

For people under 40, an attack of the viral infection led to the risk of stroke rising by 74 per cent and a heart attack by 50 per cent.

Older people were less affected, but shingles increased their risk of a heart attack by 10 per cent and of a ‘mini-stroke’ or transient ischaemic attack by 15 per cent.

Shingles is caused by reactivation of the virus that causes chickenpox.

According to the NHS, it is estimated that 189,000 adults get shingles in the UK every year.

After a case of chickenpox, the virus stays dormant in the body but can flare up into shingles in people with a weakened immune system due to age, stress or poor health.

Symptoms include nerve pain and a blistering skin rash.

The researchers suggest that reactivation of the virus can spread to the arteries, which pushes up the risk of cardiovascular disease.

The link between shingles and heart problems was found by British researchers, who studied 106,000 shingles sufferers and 213,200 people of a similar age who did not have shingles.

Records from a GP database were reviewed for an average of six years after diagnosis, up to 24 years.

The study, published in the online issue of the journal Neurology, took into account traditional risk factors such as obesity, smoking and high cholesterol.

Study author Dr Judith Breuer, from University College London, said: ‘Anyone with shingles, and especially younger people, should be screened for stroke risk factors.’

Shingles
 is caused by the same virus as chickenpox, the herpes varicella-zoster 
virus, and causes a painful rash which develops into itchy blisters.

It
 is an infection of a nerve and the skin around it which can also make 
people feel unwell for several days before any rash appears.

Most
 people carry the virus dormant after suffering from chickenpox as a 
child, but it can be reactivated in later life to cause shingles.

There
 is currently no cure for the disease and in most cases the painful rash
 lasts between 7 and 10 days, although it can take two to four weeks to 
fully heal.

The disease
 can also lead to complications such as postherpetic neuralgia, which is
 when severe nerve pain lasts for more than three months after the rash 
has gone.

Estimations suggest this affects at least 1 in 10 people with shingles, although it is more common in older people.
