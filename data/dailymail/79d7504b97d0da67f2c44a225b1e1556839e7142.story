The Federal bureau of Investigations has joined the search for a Florida woman who's alleged to have kidnapped her daughter to keep the girl's father from having her vaccinated and 'brainwashed.'

Robert Baumann, the father of 2-year-old Lilly Everett, hasn't seen his daughter since May 6, when he dropped her off with her mother, 22-year-old Megan Elizabeth Everett. He thinks Everett wants to keep the girl from school so she can home-school her and teach her about the confederacy.

Lilly was supposed to be returned to Baumann the following week, per the terms of the custody agreement between the parents.

Lilly, however, was never returned, and now Everett is on the run after leaving a cryptic note explaining why she'd taken her daughter.

'You are a great dad,' she wrote in the note to her current boyfriend, Carlos Lesters. 'If I
 let them take her and vaccinate her and brainwash her, I wouldn't be 
doing what's right. I cannot let a judge tell me how my daughter should 
be raised. We will miss you. But I had to leave.'

On May 19, a circuit court judge in Broward County signed a federal warrant for Everett's arrest on charges of kidnapping, interference with custody and concealing a minor 
contrary to a court order. The warrant accuses the young mother of crossing state lines to avoid prosecution on state charges.

Even Everett's family believes Lilly belongs with her father, given her mother's state of mind.

'In the state of mind my daughter is in, Lilly would be better off with Robert,' Pam Everett, Megan Everett's mother, told the Sun-Sentinel. 'I have four kids, and Megan is my baby. I don't know what happened to her.'

The paper reports that Lilly and Megan lived with Pam Everett until the baby was eight months old, at which point she moved in with Carlos Lesters, whom the Sun-Sentinel describes as 'a Confederate-flag-waving gun enthusiast with family members in Georgia and Kentucky.'

Lesters appears to be influencing Everett, according to Baumann.

'One of the issues we had was, she wanted to home-school my daughter,' 
said Baumann. 'I didn't want that to happen. She didn't want Lilly to 
learn about black history. She just wanted her to learn about the 
Confederacy.'

Baumann says he thinks Everett's desire to home-school Lilly led to her new-found opposition to vaccinating the girl.

'She found this new idea that vaccines are horrible,' Baumann said. 'I 
think she wanted to keep her from being vaccinated because that would 
keep her out of day care.'

After her disappearance, police went to the home Everett shared with Lester, who told investigators that Everett and Lilly were not there and were 'not coming back,' according to a federal complaint.

'Lesters informed detectives that Everett â€¦ knew she would have to live 
her life as a fugitive,' the complaint states. 'However, in her mind, 
the time that she spent with her daughter "free" of Baumann would be "worth it," regardless of how brief the time was.'

Police ask anyone with information about the whereabouts of Everett and 
Lilly to call 954-746-3600 or Broward Crime Stoppers at 954-493-TIPS 
(8477).
