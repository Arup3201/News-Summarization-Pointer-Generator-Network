A Dutch man has won the right to take his amputated leg home from a hospital and turn it into a lamp stand.

Leo Bonten, from Spijkenisse in the Netherlands, is hoping his creation will fetch more than £78,000 so that he can buy himself a prosthetic limb. 

The 53-year-old had his right leg leg surgically removed after contracting a bacterial infection when he broke it in an accident in July 2012.

Plan: Mr Bonten is hoping the sale of his leg lamp will help him to raise money for a prosthetic leg

A friend had tried to push him into a paddling pool when the pair slipped, and the friend landing on top of Mr Bonten, snapping his leg.

Mr Bonten decided he wanted to make 'the world's only leg lamp' after being told that he was going to have to have it amputated - and that the limb would be incinerated.

However, he was told that the leg would be the property of the hospital that removed it.

As he told Dutch publication NRC Reader: 'My leg is my property. People keep their kidney stones in a jar on the mantelpieces. Ashes of deceased people are included in tattoos. 

'I’m going to make a lamp of my leg.'

Crutches: Mr Bonten is using crutches as he tries to accumulate enough money for a prosthetic leg

The hospital finally agreed to allow Mr Bonten to keep his leg after it was removed, and it was then he moved forward with his idea to raise funds for a prosthesis.

Mr Bonten sought the assistance of pathologist Frank van de Goot to help him preserve his leg - and he now hopes an 'eccentric billionaire' will decide to purchase the extraordinary household accessory.

During the video, Mr Bonten can be seen walking on crutches and speaking about how the idea for the leg lamp was initiated.

He said: 'I want to sell the leg, the leg lamp. Because the prosthetic leg I'm going to get from the insurance, I wouldn't be able to do a lot with it. 

Artistic: The unusual and unique leg lamp was created by designer Willem Schaperkotter

'And I want to have a prosthetic leg that would be capable to do a lot of things but that costs some money.'

On Sunday Mr Bonten was putting together the details for the sale of the lamp which was created by designer Willem Schaperkotter.

Mr Bonten added: 'I'm hoping an eccentric billionaire who thinks 'well, that's the only leg lamp in the world.

'It's the first person who made a lamp out of [an] amputated leg, and I want to have it. Because it's the only one in the world, [it's] unique.'

He initially put his leg lamp for sale on website eBay but the listing was subsequently taken down as eBay does not allow the sale of human remains or body parts.
