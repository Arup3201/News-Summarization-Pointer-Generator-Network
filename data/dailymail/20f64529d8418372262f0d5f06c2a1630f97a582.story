Loss: Andrew Kirkman, a student at Balliol College, Oxford, gassed himself in a tent hours after breaking up for Christmas

An Oxford student gassed himself in a tent hours after breaking up for Christmas.

Andrew Kirkman, who was in his second year at Balliol, was found dead by a walker who spotted his tent in a meadow on the edge of the city.

It is thought the talented physics and philosophy student killed himself with chemicals.

The discovery of his body led to a major chemical alert with six people being treated for exposure to dangerous fumes.

Last night a friend said the 20-year-old had told her only a few weeks ago that he had been going through a ‘rough time’.

‘I messaged Andrew on Facebook a few weeks ago and asked how he was getting on at Oxford,’ Danielle Bethel said.

‘He replied that he was having a rough time. I asked if there was anything I could do to help but he didn’t reply.’

The tearful 19-year-old student, from Watford, added: ‘He had a brilliant mind and so much potential to do something amazing.

‘I can’t believe he has gone. He was just incredibly smart.’

Mr Kirkman, who went to Rickmansworth School in Hertfordshire and had a brother called George, had discussed exam worries on Twitter in May.

In one post, on May 31, he told a friend: ‘I feel ok but there’s a very real chance I’ll fail all of mine.’ Other worried tweets followed.

Last night his parents, who live in a £1million detached house in Northwood, north-west London, paid tribute to a ‘friendly and thoughtful’ young man.

In a statement released through the university, Wendy and Michael said: ‘Andy was loved by everyone who knew him. He was a kind young man who took great pleasure in helping other people. He will be sorely missed.’

Sara Lomax, who studied physics with Mr Kirkman at A-level, said she was almost certain he would not have committed suicide.

‘He was a quiet lad but happy within himself,’ she added. ‘He was never a depressive sort. He was just so bright – he knew he had a good life ahead of him. He didn’t care what others thought of him.

‘Andrew was so, so passionate about physics that it wouldn’t surprise me if he was conducting an experiment with some chemicals. It may be something just got out of hand and he didn’t quite have the knowledge to save himself.’

Abigail Miles, 19, who was a school prefect with Mr Kirkman, said: ‘He was really good at physics – he was clever at everything.’

Officials from the Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Team were drafted in after strong chemical odours were detected coming from the tent.

Within an hour all of Port Meadow had been sealed off and specialist teams began their examinations.

Mr Kirkman was pronounced dead at the scene on Sunday and the six fume victims were taken  to hospital.

Sushila Dhall, of the Oxford 
Pedestrians Association, said: ‘I tried to get on to the meadow but I 
was turned away and was told there had been a toxic spillage.

‘There were people in full-body suits and police stopped people from going on to the meadow.’

The police and university were unable to comment on where the student may have obtained the chemicals.

A police spokesman said there were no suspicious circumstances and officers were treating the death as unexplained.

Port
 Meadow, which is run by Oxford City Council and is used by walkers and 
families, has reopened following the incident. An inquest is expected to
 open this week.
