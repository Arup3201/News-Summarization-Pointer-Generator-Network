She's the flame-haired make-up artist  credited with transforming the likes of Penelope Cruz, Millie Mackintosh and Cara Delevingne. Poppy Delevingne, 28, even called on her to do her bridal make-up for her wedding earlier this year.

So it's fair to say that Charlotte Tilbury, who is Kate Moss' go-to make-up artist and best friend, knows a thing or two about beauty.

It is perhaps then little surprise that A-lister Kim Kardashian, 33, known for her love of dazzling red carpet looks, called on the make-up maestro to give her a Brit girl makeover when she landed in London recently.

Beauty buddies: Kim Kardashian enlisted the help of make-up artist to the stars, Charlotte Tilbury, during her time in London and was treated to a 'Dolce Vita' makeover

The pair met in London last week and Charlotte taught Kim all the tricks of her trade and treated her to her £165 'Dolce Vita' makeover.

'This look is for the woman who lives  a life of luxury, pleasure and indulgence,' says Charlotte. 

'Underneath those full, flirtatious lashes is a super sultry stare. "Come to bed eyes" may as well have been a phrase invented for her.

'A seductive lashline flicks outwards and upwards in an alluring, smoky homage to the screen sirens and starlets past and present; Sophia Loren, Penelope Cruz, Monica Bellucci.'

She prepped the TV star's skin with her famous magic cream, which she decided to mass produce after it became a hit with models backstage at fashion week, before using her Wonderglow beauty flash and Filmstar Bronze and Glow contour kit - a perfect product for the lady who put contouring on the map. 

Showcasing the look: Kim showed off Charlotte's work on a night out in east London. The look, which Charlotte describes as for the woman who lives a life of luxury, pleasure and indulgence, consists of bronzed eyes and a pink lip

She then powdered Kim's T-zone, curled her eyelashes to open her eyes, and created a bronzed, smokey eye with her shadows and a feline flick with kohl pencil.

She applied 'lashings and lashings' of mascara before using her bronzing sculpt shade over Kim's cheekbones, temples and chin before taking the highlighter across the top of the cheekbones, down the middle of the nose and across the top of the mouth.

She completed the star's look with a natural pink liner and lipstick and a swish of blush on the apple of her cheeks.

In a tutorial on achieving the look on her website CharlotteTilbury.com Charlotte explains that the style is perfect for olive-skinned beauties like Kim, using smouldering copper and bronze shades on the 33-year-old, paired with a pink seductive lip.

Speaking about working with the reality TV star, Charlotte said: 'I had the pleasure of working with the charming and absolutely beautiful Kim Kardashian - she has the most outrageously natural long lashes I've ever seen!'.

Kim has just finished a stint in France, where she's been supporting her younger sister Kendall's modelling career at Paris Fashion Week. 

On Tuesday, however, the mother-of-one skipped Kendall's appearance at the Chanel show, instead heading to Studio Zero for a secret photoshoot with supermodel Cara Delevingne - believed to be for Love magazine.

Kim showed off a sexy collection of outfits during her time in Paris including a daring lace jumpsuit worn to the Givenchy show on Sunday evening and a cleavage-baring blouse for an outing the following day.
