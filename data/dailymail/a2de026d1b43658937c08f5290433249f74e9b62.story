With album titles like Reign In Blood, Hell Awaits and World Painted Blood, you wouldn't expect the thrash metal Slayer to have a softer side.

But when Kerry King, 50, the guitarist of the platinum-selling group, along with members of the band's entourage, were offered an abandoned and freezing kitten on the streets of Indianapolis by a homeless man, they took the suffering animal in and nursed it back to health.

Slayer’s publicist Heidi Robinson-Fitzgerald told Nuvo.net: 'Kerry [King] and some of the crew went to dinner at Kerry's favourite steak house in Indy, St. Elmo's Steak House.

'Afterwards, the assistant tour manager, Jess [Cortese] saw a homeless man on the street who offered up this little kitten for a dollar.

'The kitten apparently was freezing so Jess took it, slept with her in her bunk on the bus and went to the venue with her today, hanging out.

'One of the runners knew someone who wanted a kitten, so the little guy now has a new home where he or she currently is.'

A day later the Old National Centre, the venue where the band performed alongside Suicidal Tendencies and Exodus, posted a photo on Facebook of the rescued kitten confirming it had been rehoused.

In the comments, the cat’s new owner shared a picture of her new pet, writing: 'Here she is! I named her Gypsy! I gave her a bath last night then she slept for 5 hours on the heating pad.

'She's at the vet this morning being treated for fleas and worms. Thank you SLAYER for your act of kindness and thank you.'

Slayer was formed in Huntington Park, California, and hit the music scene with the influential 1986 release Reign in Blood. Between 1991 and 2004, the band sold more than 3.5 million albums in the U.S.

They have attracted controversy for their graphic lyrics and album covers featuring anti-religious and violent imagery.
