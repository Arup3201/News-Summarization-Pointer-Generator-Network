Just because they're floating in microgravity, orbiting 267 miles above Earth, doesn't mean astronauts don't want to look their best.

In a video released by the European Space Agency, Italian-born Samantha Cristoforetti is seen visiting 'Chez Terry' - a makeshift hair salon on board the International Space Station. 

As her colleague Terry Virts styles her hair, cosmonaut Anton Shkaplerov is shown following the scissors around with a vacuum to catch the offcuts.

Italian-born astronaut Samantha Cristoferetti tweeted images of her recent haircut, saying: 'New Year, time for a haircut. Setting up shop at 'Chez Terry.' During subsequent tweets, she posted a photo of her shampooing her hair before showing the first hairs going into the vacuum

Ms Cristoferetti tweeted the event, saying: 'New Year, time for a haircut. Setting up shop at "Chez Terry".'

During subsequent tweets, she posted a photo of her shampooing her hair before showing the first hairs going into the vacuum. 

The 37-year-old later wrote: 'Voila'. I think @AstroTerry's preflight training paid off, right?'.

Each of her tweets are written in both English and Italian.  

In microgravity, water clings to the body instead of running down it, so astronauts have sponge baths instead of regular showers.

There is a limited supply of water on the International Space Station (ISS) so taking sponge baths also saves water.

In space, astronauts use a no-rinse shampoo to wash their hair, and apply the shampoo using a towel, vigorously rub their hair and scalp. They then use a towel to wipe their hair clean. 

The reason for the vacuum is to make sure loose hairs don't float around the station.  

'Astronauts must not let loose hairs fall off the towel because floating hairs can create a safety hazard since they can be inhaled or aggravate an astronauts' eyes,' explained the Canadian Space Agency.

'Loose hair can also clog filters and affect air circulation and filtration.'

Shaving in space is similar to shaving on Earth, astronauts just have to be careful not to let stray whiskers escape into the air, like with a haircut. 

Astronauts shave with foam or an electric razor, but most are said to prefer the latter, because it doesn't require water and automatically collects hair. 

And, no water is wasted, because as it dries on a person's head, it is collected by the air conditioning system, which turns it into condensate and then into drinking water.

In the video, Ms Cristoferreti holds onto bars on a wall of the station to keep herself still. Mr Virts and Mr Shkaplerov then float around her.

Last year, Nasa astronaut Karen Nyberg revealed how tricky it can be to wash long hair in space.

The mechanical engineer was on board Expedition 36 to the International Space Station until November and during her time, she was regularly asked how she washed her long blonde hair. 

She tweeted a video saying: 'I have had a LOT of questions about how I wash my hair in space! Let me show you…'

In the video, Ms Nyberg can be seen placing water on to her scalp, battling with a few escaping bubbles. Then she adds leave-in shampoo, which she works into her hair. 

Her tools are stuck to the wall beside her to prevent them from escaping, and she towels her hair dry.

Ms Nyberg also recently demonstrated how, in microgravity, a tiny push at a skewed angle can send an astronaut floating off in the wrong direction. In a video created to explain the effects of weightlessness, Ms Nyberg used a strand of her own hair to send herself tumbling away from a wall of the ISS

Even a single strand of hair can be enough to propel a body away from a surface. 

In a video created to explain the effects of weightlessness, Ms Nyberg used one strand of her own hair to send herself tumbling away from a wall of the International Space Station (ISS).
