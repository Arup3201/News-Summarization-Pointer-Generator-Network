More details have emerged about what President Barack Obama is like behind-the-scenes ahead of the release of a tell-all memoir from the 'bodyman' who worked alongside Obama for years.

Reggie Love, who worked as Obama's personal aide during the 2008 presidential campaign and during his first years in the White House, is revealing all in his book, Power Forward: My Presidential Education, which will be released early next month.

Love says that the 53-year-old is very particular about his diet and his a complete health freak, but is the most pedantic about his shoes.

'Shoes were always the biggest challenge for the senator. The man was particular about his feet. He wouldn’t just throw on any old pair of mukluks. They had to look a certain way, feel a certain way. Anytime he couldn’t wear his favored dress flats, it was an issue,' Love wrote in the book, according to The New York Post.

'Throughout the campaign, I was always trying to scratch and scrounge to procure the ideal footwear. I’d send screen-shots to the advance teams and say, ‘Find these!’ Also, ‘Buy wool socks!’”

Obama even discussed his penchant for footwear with Beyonce and Jay-Z during a meeting at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel in New York.

Beyonce had just finished a tour and said her feet were killing her, prompting the president to say she needed to get a foot massage from a masseuse. 

'That must be in the budget for the tour production,' Obama joked. 

'And Jay said, ''Yeah, so long as it isn’t a man'',’ Love wrote in his book.

'I quipped, ''You’ve seen 'Pulp Fiction. You never let another man massage your woman’s feet'', after which Jay burst out laughing.'

According to Love, Obama became adamant in the diet department.

Among the restrictions were: 'No gum wrapped in tiny papers. No energy bars with fruits. Salads only in emergencies. … Nothing battered or fried.'

Love said Obama once picked out all the chocolate from a trail mix packet and said he refused to eat it.

One time Love said he went to Wendy's for some fast food, only for Obama to say: 'That stuff will kill you.'

Love asked if he could still indulge in McNuggets.

'Reggie, you won’t be young forever,' Obama quipped.

However, during the campaign trail, Obama was forced to eat his diet stipulations - literally - while drumming up support in Iowa.

Love said Obama had to bow down to a state ritual and eat a Maid-Rite lose meat sandwich - a  'heap of coarsely boiled ground beef bigger than your average Chihuahua that is served spilling out of a platter-sized, fluffy white bun'. 

Obama 'was aware that people in Iowa loved their loose meat sandwiches, and so it went down', Love said.

'For months after, I would tease the senator with ''Man I cannot believe you ate that sandwich''.

'And he would smile and say, ‘'Nobody can ever say I didn’t want to win''.’

On Obama's sense of humor, Love said he once joked about taking everyone out to a strip club.

At the time the campaign trip had hit Las Vegas, and NBA player Charles Barkley wanted to 'hang out'

'Let’s just take tomorrow off and go to the Cheetah Club,' Obama joked to his staff, Love said.

Cheetahs Las Vegas is a famous Gentleman's Club.  

Love developed a very personal bond with Obama. 

According to the Washington Post, Love recounts a moment when his professional relationship with the president turned personal.

Love wrote that he was staying in a hotel during the presidential election campaign when he had a female friend to stay. 

The next morning Love was getting ready for the day ahead but the woman was in bed when, using the Secret Service master key, Obama opened the door, walked in, and said: 'Hey, Reggie, we need to go over the schedule.'

After noticing the guest lying on the bed he said: 'Oh, I apologize' before hurrying back out. 

'Bodyman': Obama reportedly referred to Love as iReggie - a reference to Love's iPad usage.

The response drew a laugh from David Axelrod and Robert Gibbs, but Love had a comeback.

He said: 'Actually, sir, I got way more action in college.' 

Love applied for an internship at the White House in 2006 after studying at Duke where he also played wide receiver for the football team.

Love was appointed 'deputy political director' and Obama reportedly referred to Love as iReggie - a reference to Love's iPad usage. Love left his position at the end of 2011 to pursue an MBA.

His terrified friend, with the cover pulled up to her throat, then asked: 'Was that... ?' To which Love replied: 'Senator Barack Obama.'

Later in the day, the campaign team boarded a plane to their next destination and Obama started arguing with his campaign staff over their progress. 

To lighten the mood, Love told Obama: 'You know, sir, if it’s any consolation, I’m having the time of my life.'

'And the senator said to me, “Well, Reggie, it’s actually not a consolation to me that my campaign for president can help subsidize your love life.”'
