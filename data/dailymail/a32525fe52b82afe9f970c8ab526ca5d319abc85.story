Burnley head into Tuesday's Capital One Cup tie against Sheffield Wednesday off the back of defeats in their opening two games of the season - but midfielder David Jones is convinced things are coming together for the team.

The Clarets' comeback campaign in the Barclays Premier League has so far seen them lose 3-1 at home against Chelsea and then go down 1-0 at Swansea on Saturday.

Jones believes there were plenty of positives to take from the second-half performance against the Swans as he and his team-mates tried to fight back after Nathan Dyer's 23rd-minute strike.

'I think there was more belief in the second half,' said Jones, quoted by the Lancashire Telegraph.

'We seemed to move the ball quickly and it looked as if we had more space and they couldn't cope with our shape and the way we shifted the ball.

'It was a good showing in the second half and something to definitely build on in the next game.'

Jones is in no doubt Burnley must soon start making the good things they are doing, and the lessons they are learning from their top-flight return, count.

'I think we took the shackles off and played with some freedom, but we can't wait to go a goal behind to do that,' he added.

'We've had two games and we need to learn quickly.

'We've had two games where we've had sort of a bedding-in period.

'Obviously we wanted to pick points up in those games but now we need to move on quickly and look forward to the next game.'

Clarets boss Sean Dyche, who named the same first XI for both matches so far, is set to shuffle his pack for the clash with Sky Bet Championship outfit Wednesday at Turf Moor.

Matt Gilks, Stephen Reid and Stephen Ward are all summer signings yet to make their debuts and will be hopeful of doing so on Tuesday.

Dyche has no fresh injury problems after Saturday, with Sam Vokes (anterior cruciate ligament damage) his only unavailable player.

And the manager told his club's official website www.burnleyfootballclub.com: 'There's a different feel to the cup because of the enormity of the Premier League.

'We have always respected all of the cups and we will do that again, but it's also important that we use players.

'We have a deeper squad than last season and we need to make sure that players are fit because everyone can see the demands that are on the players here, so we will look at the idea of change.

'That's not necessarily what we are going to do, but players do need games and there is a bigger picture to our season and that's here for all to see.'

Dyche, who continues to seek new recruits with the transfer deadline now just a week away, added: 'I think I am loyal to players, but I am not naively loyal and I need to see the people we have brought in and how they operate and can affect the team, because we have brought them in for a reason.’
