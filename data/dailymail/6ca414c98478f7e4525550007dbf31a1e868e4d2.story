Their clingy gowns and man-corsets might not offer much room for expansion, but with a menu featuring the best of American produce, celebrities attending this years' Oscars Governor's Ball will find it hard not to tuck in.

Nominees including Eddie Redmayne, Bradley Cooper, Julianne Moore and Reese Witherspoon will be dining on mouth-watering dishes such as parsnip soup with white chocolate, pears and 24k gold, and mini gold-wrapped baked potatoes with French farm-raised Osetra caviar and creme fraiche at the Dolby Ballroom at the Hollywood & Highland Center, where the Academy hosts its annual post-Oscars celebration on Sunday.

The stars will feast on chef Wolfgang Puck and Matt Bencivenga, chef partner of Wolfgang Puck Catering's, menu which features more than 50 dishes from hors d'oeuvres to small-plate entrees.
