Building an interstellar spacecraft that can take humans beyond the solar system might sound like something out of a sci-fi film - but one organisation has plans to do just that in the next 100 years.

Designers claim that in order to do so, we’ll need to build ‘living worldships’ akin to Noah’s Ark that are entirely self-sustainable.

These ships could then be used to rescue and house the human population in the event of a global catastrophe, for example.

New research suggests that if we want to achieve interstellar travel we will need to build self-sustainable 'living worldships' that can support multiple generations of humans.

Dubbed Project Persephone, the research is looking at how a long-duration manned mission out of the solar system could feasibly survive.

The conclusion is that any future ‘generation ship’ we build will need to be entirely self-sustainable in terms of not only food and water, but cultural advances as well.

In essence, any manned vehicle we one day send into interstellar space will need a 'flourishing ecosystem'.

Project Persephone is a study for Icarus Interstellar - a non-profit organisation hoping to one day enable human interstellar spaceflight through their One Hundred Year Starship Project.

This is a joint project run by Darpa, Nasa, Icarus Interstellar and the Foundation for Enterprise Development.

Announced in January 2012, it has the goal of achieving manned interstellar travel by 2112.

To do so it is evaluating a number of different techonolgies, including ‘warping’ space time to travel great distances in short time frames at faster-than-light speeds.

The project is also considering building ‘generation ships’ that move slowly but have a self-sustainable long-term population.

To date Nasa has contributed $100,000 (£60,000) to the project and Darpa $1 million (£600,000).

It is the belief of Icarus, and other agencies and organisations, that humanity can build a ‘worldship’ in 100 years that will take a large group of people on a mission beyond the solar system.

This could be a so-called generation ship, with multiple generations of humans living aboard the vessel on its journey into deep space and back again.

To make such a mission possible would require an initiative such as Project Persephone, said project leader Rachel Armstrong, a senior architecture and design lecturer at the University of Greenwich.

‘Persephone is the living interior of a worldship,’ Armstrong tells MailOnline.

‘We’re not trying to just take stuff from Earth and put it in a giant pot, it’s about how do we design an environment within a closed system.

‘So, could we grow an ecosystem from scratch?’

Armstrong’s research suggests that if we do build an interstellar spaceship within 100 years - which she is fairly certain we will - the ship itself will need to be like a mini-Earth.

We will need to take into account soil, weather cycles and other processes that underpin our existence.

This includes technological advances - the society on the ship will need to be able to anticipate cultural steps that will be occurring on Earth.

‘Rather than presupposing what the needs of an interstellar civilization may be within this system, which will experience its own physical and chemical rhythms, Persephone is approaching the idea of a living space within a worldship by taking a bottom-up approach to its construction,' Armstrong writes in her research.

‘By understanding the basic physical and chemical interactions that may spontaneously form systems that shape the flow of matter through the worldship, it may be possible to create events within them such as, growth and decomposition, around which human activity can thrive.’

In Armstrong's research she has been studying artificial soils for interstellar spacecraft including Liesegang Floret 3, pictured, which uses activated gel and inorganic salts to move substances through a matrix

The worldship, artist's impression pictured, could be built from space junk in order to grow its living interior - a unique kind of space ecology. The spaceship would also gather asteroids in order to aid its sustainability

‘Paradoxically on Earth we have ruined the most fertile soils by building cities, so essentially the idea is to see what kind of life a space soil might support,’ explained Armstrong.

‘We kind of understand the speculative nature of this project but it’s about understanding the broad questions.’

The aim is
 to build such an interstellar spaceship in a century although, admitted Armstrong: ‘Whether that’s achievable I don’t know.’

But, as Armstrong pointed out, it is not only private organisations like Icarus Interstellar that are researching ambitious projects like this.

In the U.S., Darpa and Nasa are working on the same 100 Year Starship (100YSS) project with the goal of taking humans outside the solar system in 100 years.

‘I think the consensus for the next generation of space vessels is 100 years,’ said Armstrong.

‘Whether we’ll have a full starship or not depends on funding, technological progress and cultural support for these kinds of projects.’

Armstrong added that, in order to keep continued support, some of the technology designed for these ‘starship cities’ could be transferred into modern cities.

This would allow the public to see useful applications deriving from such research.

Future living worldships will need to make use of resources in their environment in order to survive. This could include utilising asteroids and space junk to ensure the ship is self-sustainable. An artist's impression of this kind of ship is pictured

Building self-sustainable spacecraft is the key to interstellar travel

@highlight

That's according to Rachel Armstrong, the lead on Project Persephone

@highlight

She said we need to design methods to support space-based ecosystems

@highlight

This would enable us to travel beyond the solar system in 100 years

The project is part of a study being funded by both Nasa and Darpa
