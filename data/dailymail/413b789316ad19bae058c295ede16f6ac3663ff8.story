An angry couple have torn down the rear wall of their beloved beach hut to protest against a council decision to increase the rent by 12 per cent

Barbara Grace, 62, and partner Alan Sarfas, 57, were outraged when they were told that the ground rent for their hut which they use all year round was set to go up to £787 from £702.

But they found that they could get round the increase by reducing the overall size of their 10ft by 8ft 6ins hut overlooking the North Sea at Felixstowe, Suffolk.

Instead of paying the extra cash, they used an electric saw powered by a generator to slice off 18 inches from the rear to reduce its overall floor area.

Alan Sarfas and Barbara Grace have chopped off 18 inches from their beach hut in Felixstowe, Suffolk to avoid the price rise

The couple will now save £160 in rent each year - but lost a precious bit of space from their beloved hut, which they bought nine years ago

It means the hut is now in a lower price bracket as it takes up less space so they will only be charged £616 by Suffolk Coastal District Council.

The couple, who are both former bank workers, were today putting up a new rear wall on the hut named Idle Hours which now measures 8ft 6ins square.

Mother-of-two Mrs Grace said: 'I am having to get used to the hut being a little smaller it, but it is worth it as we will not have to pay the council so much.

'The rent for huts at Felixstowe has doubled since we bought ours nine-years-ago and it is far higher than other local towns.

'It started leaping up three years ago and the latest 12 per cent increase is obscene.

'The council is profiteering. It is sheer greed and they cannot justify the latest increase.

'We want to draw attention to how the council is making a fortune out of us and all the other beach hut owners.

'Nobody would have questioned an increase in line with inflation.

Mr Sarfas said the rent for huts at Felixstowe has doubled since we bought ours nine-years-ago

The couple, who spent around £270 downsizing their place, use it daily between May and November

'I know people will think that cutting up our hut is an extreme measure - but we do not see why we should pay so much. We have done it out of principle.

'We know of a lady aged 84 who has had a hut here for 40 years, but she is having to give it up because she cannot afford the latest increase.'

The grandmother-of-six, who swims on the beach every day in the summer, said the work to cut up the hut had cost around £270 in materials.

She said: 'We had to buy wood to make a new rear wall and a frame for it.

'Luckily Alan is quite handy at woodwork so he is doing the work himself with my help.

'We had to put in a false back wall first with wooden boards. Then we chopped the entire 18 inch section off the back.'

The couple who live in Felixstowe are taking the opportunity to spend another £180 on refurbishing the hut with new kitchen units and a seat against one wall which will double as a bed.

They are especially upset as beach hut owners in nearby Clacton-on-Sea, Essex, have their rent reduced by around half by Tendring District Council if they are local residents.

Cutting corners: The couple say they also use the hut regularly throughout the winter

The hut, named Idle Hours, now measures 8ft 6ins square, after the pair decided to take a stand against the council

Mr Safras said: 'It should be the same system here - but everyone is charged the same for a hut regardless of where they live.

'The council works out the rent through a sliding scale depending on the floor area of each hut.

'It goes up around £10 for every tenth of a square metre.

'As far as I know they are the only council around here to do this. Others just have two prices - one for large huts and one for small.

'The cost of the chopping the end of the hut means we will not be saving money this year, but by next year we will not be paying so much.'

The couple paid £2,000 for the hut nine-years-ago and use it daily between May and November when Mrs Grace goes swimming up to three times a day.

They also use it regularly during the winter when they like to sit inside and tuck into cheese rolls and soup heated up on the gas stove.

Mrs Grace added: 'We have had childrens' parties here. We even pop down on Christmas Day and New Year's Day for mince pies.

'Several other beach hut owners have seen what we have done and they are considering chopping the ends off their huts as well.

'But many of the hut owners are elderly and wouldn't know how to complain and also would be too scared to do so.

'It is making it very difficult for ordinary people to afford a hut.'

A Suffolk Coastal District Council spokesman said it was up to each of the 1,000 beach hut owners in Felixstowe to decide the size of their huts.

Geoff Holdcroft, the council's cabinet member for economic development and leisure, said he believed the rents were still 'value for money'.

He said: 'We are in tough financial times and need to generate enough income to ensure that we can still provide our free services such as our public toilets and rubbish collection and street cleansing that visitors to our tourist attractions such as Felixstowe are receiving.'

A Suffolk Coastal District Council spokesman said: 'The facts are that licences in Suffolk Coastal were comparatively very good value, that there is clear unmet demand for a licence with a five year waiting list, and that the Council has a duty to charge a fair rate for all its services so it can help fund its priority services used its residents.

'The financial realities facing the Council are that it has less money to spend than it did six years ago despite its population and demand for services having grown significantly. Since 2010, the amount of Government grant towards the cost of local services has also dropped by 30 per cent.

'It is up to each hut owner what size their beach hut is.

'Reducing the size of the hut will also mean that their business rates bill would also reduce, although thanks to the efforts of Suffolk Coastal, virtually all licence holders receive a 100 per cent rebate on their business rates bill so are currently saving between £150 and £300 a year.'
