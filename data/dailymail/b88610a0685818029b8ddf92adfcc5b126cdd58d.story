Dani Alves is coming to England, according to an interview the player has given to O Globo in Brazil. In news that will put half of the Premier League on alert. the full back is quoted as saying he will be playing in the Premier League next season after walking away from Barcelona after seven glorious years.

Sources close to the player told MailOnline on Wednesday night that the player was simply expressing an interest in England and stressed that the interview was given at the end of last season. 

The interview was with Brazilian food critic Luciana Froes and almost all of its content relates to a project Alves has to create a chain of restaurants but when the conversation moves to his future on the pitch he says: 'This will be my last season at Barcelona. Next year I will move to England. I want to play in the birthplace of football.'

No club is mentioned in the the O Globo exclusive but the news is likely to increase interest from a host of clubs keen on the defender who arrived at Barça in 2008 and has since won every honour possible including two Champions Leagues and four La Liga titles.

Alves' contract runs out at the end of this season when he will be 32. Barça have already made plans to replace him buying Sao Paolo full-back Douglas in the summer. But the new man's recent debut against Malaga gave an early indication of just how much Alves will be missed.

Alves didn't have his best night against PSG on Tuesday but he has played a part in Barcelona going five games without conceding in the league and he was at his assist-giving best in the weekend thrashing of Granada crossing for Leo Messi to score.

The two have combined brilliantly throughout the last seven years and the Argentine will miss him. What remains to be seen is which Premier League coach is prepared to take a gamble on the world's most attacking full-back. Here are his options:

Manuel Pellegrini: Loves an attacking full-back although he still has Pablo Zabaleta in that position and with a contract until 2017.

Jose Mourinho: There is as much chance of Alves fitting into one of Mourinho's finally-tuned defences as there is Mourinho donning one of Dani's red-trouser and denim-waistcoat post-match outfits for his next Premier League press conference.

Arsene Wenger: Difficult to see Arsene making the move although with Debuchy injured he could do with Alves now.

Brendan Rodgers: Loves an attacking full-back – with Moreno on one side and Alves on the other Liverpool would be some force going forward… and a disaster defensively.

Roberto Martinez: Everton have a right-back shortage. Alves could even help realize Martinez' long-term aim of playing 3-4-3.

Mauricio Pochettino: With Kyle Walker out Spurs are another who could do with Alves now. And you can see him preferring a move to London if he does switch to England.
