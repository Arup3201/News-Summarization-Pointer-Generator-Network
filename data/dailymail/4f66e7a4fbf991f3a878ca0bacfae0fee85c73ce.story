She has lived through six different monarchs, outlived two of her owners and even survived the Blitz.

At 116 years old, Tommy the tortoise could be Britain's oldest pet.

The female Hermann's tortoise was aged 11 when she was bought for £1 from a London market by Margaret Cloonan in 1909.

Since then, she has been passed down 
through three generations of the same family and has seen over a century of milestones, including two world 
wars, the sinking of the Titanic and the Millennium.

Now, the ageing reptile lives with Ms Cloonan's granddaughter, Sheila Floris, 57, and her husband, Carlo, at their home in Croydon, south London.

And despite never having been to a vet in her entire life, she still appears to be in perfect health.

'Tommy is a much loved member of the family and it’s amazing that my mother grew up with her, as did I and my children now,' said Mrs Floris.

'I remember loving Tommy from a young age, she was an interesting pet to have. Tommy and I have a great bond - she will even poke her head out of her shell when I call her name.

'It is just like having a dog or a cat for a pet, but with much less maintenance. Tommy is happiest in the garden, and nestling under in the bushes. She also likes a sprinkle of water on her shell in the summer, when it gets hot.'

She added: 'My
 mum never took Tommy to a vet and she was fine. So when I inherited her
 I asked lots of people whether I should get her checked out but we 
decided not to tempt fate, as she has been fine up until this point.

'She would probably die of shock on the vet’s table- so we are just going to leave her be.'

Tommy lives in Mrs Floris's garden, and has a specific spot under the hedge where she likes to stay.

During the day, she is allowed to roam loose in the garden, munching on grass and dandelions.

And despite hibernating in the ground for six months of the year, she always wakes up on either one of two days every year - April 1st which was Mrs Floris's mother's
 birthday, or Mother’s Day.

'It’s really spooky- it’s as if mum is there waking Tommy up. It’s always one of those two days, every year,' said Mrs Floris.

'A
 tortoise was a very exotic pet to have back in the 1900s, but not many 
survived. Owners would put their tortoise in a box for hibernation and 
forget about them.

'Luckily, my mother was very careful with Tommy, and it’s amazing how she is still going strong.'

Tommy, who is of the endangered Hermann's species, was given her name by Mrs Cloonan who believed she was male.

Mrs Floris said the family was shocked when they discovered her true sex after she began to lay eggs.

'Due to her age the eggs were empty but we were amazed because we
 had always thought Tommy was a boy!' she said.

'The name had stuck for so long, 
there was no way we could change it - so she is the ultimate tomboy.'

And it is not just the Floris family who love Tommy - their pet cat, Jet, has also formed an unlikely bond with the ageing reptile.

'Jet and Tommy are best friends,' said Mrs Floris. 'Jet will guard Tommy all day and make sure no animals attack her. It is heart-warming to see.'

“I don’t worry about Tommy, despite her age, because I know she is being looked after by Jet. It is such a sweet pairing.”

Tommy has outlived her two previous owners, Mrs Floris's mother and grandmother, and her owner believes she may have another 70 years left in her yet.

Mrs Floris, who has two children, Vitalia, 25 and Damien, 23, said: 'I’ve already said to my daughter that if Tommy outlives me, she is to take on responsibility for her. She is a very dear member of our family and the most precious family heirloom.'

'She has had a rich and full time, and lived through many changes along the way. Because we have grown up together it’s so nice that she likes a pat now and again and will let me feed her by hand.

'She really is the best pet I could ask for.'
