The mistress of a multi-millionaire businessman has cleared her name after her conviction for forging his £5 million will was quashed. 

Gillian Clemo, 61, was convicted of fraud after her dead lover’s wife accused her of fabricating the will of property tycoon Chris John.

Mr John’s £5 million estate included an extensive property portfolio, luxury cars including an Aston Martin and a Porsche, and a collection of Second World War medals.

His estranged wife Helen John, 51, and his mistress of nine years Ms Clemo have been engaged in a long-running legal battle since the 47-year-old businessman collapsed and died in 2008.

Mr John was found collapsed at his £750,000 home in Cardiff, which forms part of his £5 million estate

The Court of Appeal today ruled that the will that Ms Clemo had found was genuine.

Commenting after the case Ms Clemo said: 'My life has been a living hell since these false allegations were first made, five years ago.

'I am delighted to have been vindicated - I feel as though the weight of the world has been lifted from my shoulders.

'But I am also angry that this meritless case has gone so far.

'I would like to thank the huge number of people who have believed in my innocence and supported me.'

Mr John died of a brain haemorrhage at his luxury £750,000 Cardiff home he shared with Ms Clemo in 2008.

Ms Clemo's name was cleared after the Court of Appeal considered the new documentary evidence 

Ms Clemo later found a will at the home she had shared with Mr John - but police were called in by estranged wife Mrs John after she suspected it was forged. 

The disputed document ordered that the bulk of Mr John's £5 million fortune should be held in trust for his daughter Isabelle until she reached 27. 

Mrs John was only due to inherit the former matrimonial home in Cardiff. 

The High Court ruled on February 25 2013 that the original will should be executed, but Ms Clemo had to wait a further year to have her name cleared.  

A second will was later found in the same typeface and with the same signatures as the document Ms Clemo was accused of forging.

It was examined by one of the world’s foremost handwriting experts who confirmed both documents were genuine.

The fresh evidence went before the Court of Appeal in London who quashed Ms Clemo’s conviction for fraud.

Ms Clemo started her relationship with Mr John in 1999 after she started working for the family-run estate agent Chris John and Partners in Cardiff. 

Mr John died in 2008 after being found collapsed on the bathroom floor of his mansion, Penhill House in the Welsh capital.

After his death his estranged wife claimed to have found a legal document which appointed her as 'executrix and trustee' and lowered their daughter Isabelle’s age of inheritance from 27 to 25.

But the executors of Mr John’s estate brought in police because they were were 'concerned about the authenticity' of the document.

The Court of Appeal was told Helen John was arrested in April 2009 and was given a police caution after admitting forging her husband’s signature.

By then Ms Clemo had found Mr John’s true will among his daughter Isabelle’s drawings, cards and photographs.

But when Mrs John claimed it was a forgery, Ms Clemo was arrested and accused of fraud.

She was found guilty of using a false statement with intent at Newport Crown Court and fined £1,000 and ordered to pay prosecution costs.

But Mr John’s sister Melissa John brought the saga to an end when she discovered another will at the bottom of a leather holdall. The document matched the one found by Ms Clemo three years earlier.

Her solicitor, Jemma Sherwood-Roberts from Corker Binning solicitors, said: 'I am delighted with this result for Gillian, who has had to live under the weight of a false accusation and wrongful conviction for so long.

'She has been very strong and we are pleased that justice has finally been done.'
