Rebuttal: The Economist ran a feature which irritated French officials because it implied they could bring down the euro

Touchy French politicians yesterday launched  a blistering attack on a prestigious British business magazine after it branded France 'the time-bomb at the heart of Europe'.

The front cover of The Economist this week shows seven baguettes wrapped in the red, white and blue ribbon of the French Republic with a lit fuse protruding from the centre.

Its lead article says President Francois Hollande's plans to cut France's public debt are not ambitious enough, jeopardising the future of the euro.

The magazine, which is seen as supporting the single currency, accuses French leaders of delaying crucial reforms for far too long, claiming: 'You cannot defy economics for long.'

In a 14-page special report it explains why France could become the biggest danger to Europe's single currency, adding: 'The crisis could hit next year.'

But France's prime minister, Jean-Marc Ayrault, denounced The Economist's cover.

He told a French TV station: 'You are talking about a publication which is resorting to excess to sell copies. I can tell you that France is not at all impressed.'

French industry minister Arnaud Montebourg yesterday went on to a French radio show to tell of his fury at the article. 'Frankly, The Economist has never been  known for its sense of moderation,' he said.

Mr Montebourg said the claims were 'worthy of Charlie Hebdo', a notoriously provocative Paris satirical magazine whose offices were firebombed last year after it published insulting cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad which infuriated Muslims.

Mr Ayrault travelled to Berlin on Thursday to explain France's efforts to boost its declining international competitiveness to German Chancellor Angela Merkel.

The head of France's MEDEF employers' association, Laurence Parisot, also hit out at The Economist's claims, describing them as 'completely exaggerated'.

She said: 'In reality The Economist is behind the times because its dossier was concluded before the government decisions to increase competitiveness.

'At the same time, there is some truth in the report, which has France at the heart of Europe, [and] says that if France collapses then the whole of Europe collapses.'

Debate: French President Francois Hollande's reforms are the subject of criticism because they do not stretch far enough

However The Economist's Europe editor, John Peet, defended the publication on French radio yesterday.

He said: 'It is a front cover that is 
designed to shock – to say that France has some serious economic 
problems and must reform its public spending, the public sector and the 
labour market.

'It is a shock to encourage politicians to carry out reforms.

'And I hope that Mr Montebourg will also carry out these reforms.'

Socialist Mr Hollande was elected president in May this year.

But his popularity has plunged as he 
struggles to fulfil promises to reduce France's public deficit while 
kick-starting the economy when unemployment has risen to a 17-year high.

Meanwhile he has also managed to 
antagonise business leaders and entrepreneurs with a string of Left-wing
policies including a 75 per cent top rate of income tax and a reduction
in the pension age.

Along with criticism for the lack of 
reform, many economists and EU officials are sceptical that France can 
hit its target of cutting its public deficit to 3 per cent of output by 
2013.

Failure to do so could prompt 
financial markets to demand higher rates of interest for Paris 
government bonds, which are currently held at rates of around 2 per 
cent, as France, along with Germany, is viewed as a safe haven in the 
eurozone.

France has skilfully manoeuvred itself though the eurozone crisis by maintaining that it is different.

By hanging on to the skirts of Germany's Angela Merkel, it has gambled that the world and the financial markets would not notice that it has been slipping ever more deeply into the mire.

Francois Hollande, the country's lacklustre Socialist president, swept into office on the back of the dislike of his predecessor Nicolas Sarkozy, and the belief that he could deliver a growth agenda that could restore jobs and repair the financial system.

What he failed to recognise was that his country was hugely exposed to its weaker neighbours, had deficit and debt problems as bad as most of its neighbours and a bloated state sector so large it was in danger of exploding.

All of this was pointed out earlier this week in an excoriating report card from the Washington-based International Monetary Fund – which paradoxically has a French boss, Christine Lagarde – without provoking much reaction in Paris.

But when the shortcomings were featured as the cover story in this week's Economist, under the provocative headline 'The time-bomb at the heart of Europe', Hollande and his ministers went into overdrive.

It is one thing being given a scolding by the IMF. It is quite another for 'Perfidious Albion' to question the stability of France's fifth republic.

For many businessmen and financiers around the world, having The Economist on conspicuous display is regarded as a status symbol, so a cover suggesting one of the richest nations on the world is in danger of tipping over the edge is bound to have an impact on how France is viewed.

The Economist contends that the problems looming in France could dwarf the woes of Greece, Portugal, Spain and Italy.

The respected weekly magazine argues that the fragility of the French economy has been cruelly laid bare in the eurozone crisis. Many of its firms are uncompetitive because they are swamped by high taxes and mountains of red tape, as well as a notoriously strike-prone labour force.

In its analysis, The Economist claims that membership of the single currency has acted as a straitjacket on France because it means the country  cannot allow its currency to devalue.

The reality is that France has never gone through the Thatcherite reforms that made the UK so competitive over the two decades leading up to the great financial crisis. France's unique form of economic nationalism meant that whenever it felt the hot breath of competition from overseas, it simply closed ranks to keep the outsiders out. Hollande has not helped since he took over. Instead of shrinking the public sector, he decided to prop up the company and to soak the rich.

The decision to raise the top rate of income tax to 75 per cent, the highest level in the advanced world, sent wealth creators scurrying overseas to Britain and friendly climes. 

The truth is that France is in terrible difficulty. Trapped within the eurozone, it has no means of escaping its woes by devaluing its currency, or adjusting its interest rates or monetary policy that is set by the European Central Bank in Frankfurt.

This year the French economy already has moved into recession and now the IMF is forecasting that it will grow by just 0.4 per cent next year.

Despite its enormous problems the financial markets have tended to give France the benefit of the doubt believing that its commitment to the euro project would allow it to escape the worst of the eurozone's problems.

Time for Hollande and his leftist allies in Parliament is rapidly running out and the country could quickly be sucked into the vortex of financial crisis that is destroying social cohesion all over Europe.

If that happens it could be the final act for the single currency with Germany and the rich Nordic tier fleeing from what increasingly looks to be a doomed project.
