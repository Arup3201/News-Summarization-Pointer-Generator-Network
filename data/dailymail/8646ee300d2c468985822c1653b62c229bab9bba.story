They were a race of ferocious warriors, famous for their terrifying seaborne attacks and incredible shipbuilding abilities.

But if you thought the age of the Vikings was past, Björn Jakobsen, 66, king of a band of modern-day warriors from Malmö in Sweden, is living proof that for some, they never really went away.

Part of a community living and working in the Viking town Foteviken on the southern Swedish coast, Björn says the life of a Viking is a fascinating one and adds he has no plans to return to modern life.

'It's a mysterious lifestyle,' he elaborates. 'Of course I can go into modern times as 
soon as I step outside the village.

'I could just go and watch the TV but
 when I do come back to the village after [venturing out], I realise how 
beautiful [living like a Viking] is.'

For King Björn and his band of Viking warriors, daily life in Foteviken includes making time to work the surrounding fields and feasting on porridge, although as king, Björn doesn't have to work if he doesn't feel like it. 

'I just declared it,' he says of the moment he was crowned king of the Viking village. 'I said OK I am king. It was my decision.

'We have people visiting the village
 every day and I spend time communicating with them,' he adds.

Fiery portents, a dragon seen streaking across the Northumbrian sky and whirlwinds lashing the coast could mean only one thing to the fearful Anglo-Saxons watching the heavens in 793 - doom was imminent.

And doom duly came in the shape of the Vikings, who between 793 and 1066 were a hazardous part of life for the Anglo-Saxons.

Most came from Denmark, although Norwegian Vikings were also known to have had a taste for British gold.

Either way, following the Lindisfarne attack, Viking power and influence grew until by 849, the year King Alfred the Great was born, they held much of the north and east.

Although he managed to halt their advance, raids didn't cease until after the Norman Conquest.

And while the Vikings may be gone from British shores, their influence does live on in the English language.

Beserk, which means murderous rage, comes from the Anglo-Saxon 'beserker' or clad in bear-skin - an early term used to describe the Vikings.

'All the 
other Vikings will be out working in the fields and working on the farm but I can
 spend my time just looking around, or sailing or enjoying a chat or 
playing a game.'

But while Björn ensures life in the Viking village is as authentic as possible, there's one part of Viking life that he's not allowed to recreate. 

'Really, it depends what you mean by raids,' he muses. 
'We have friends in [other Viking communities] in Europe and we visit each other and each other's 
markets.

'We swap Viking tools. We travel all over the place because 
there are Vikings all over Europe.'

While raids on the British coast might be out of the question, there are still some other forms of entertainment available to Bjorn and his band of modern-day Vikings.

Most exciting of all are the feast days when Bjorn and his cohorts get to swap their daily fare for a meat-heavy feast.

'Everyone thinks it was meat and meat and
 meat,' he explains of his Viking forebears. 'But it wasn't, they ate with their hands and it was berries and 
pork.

'They eat porridge and bread every day along with a very light 
beer. If they kill an animal they don't waste it, they eat it.'

He adds: 'If a 
Viking has done well like pulling in a ship then they get a strong beer 
and meat as a reward - as a celebration of what they've done.'

Björn, who says his family - all of whom do normal jobs and live in modern homes - come to stay with him in the village in the summer, is also keen to rehabilitate the reputation of the Vikings.

They weren't, he says, just ferocious warriors and they most certainly didn't live in furs and horned helmets - for some of the time at least.

Old fashioned: All cooking in Foteviken is done over open fires, while food comes from the fields or storerooms

In charge: Björn doesn't have to work so spends his days chatting to visitors or sailing his boat

'Everyone thinks that Vikings have horns,' he complains.
 'They don't. They wore clothes made from silk and linen and had a bow 
and a spear for killing.

'Some Vikings had helmets to protect themselves and some might have
 had pieces of metal sticking out but not horns.

'You can't have 
horns because if you think about it, if you are fighting with horns, 
someone could grab those horns and drag you down - it's very dangerous.'

Happily for Björn, there's not much fighting to be done when you're a modern-day Viking and he says he wouldn't have it any other way.

'Modern day life is so rushed with all 
this modern technology,' he explains. 'Here you can relax and look at the sea and see 
the sunset. You can sit still.'

King Björn and his Viking warriors appear on Outsiders with Darren McMullen, Friday at 10pm on National Geographic Channel.
