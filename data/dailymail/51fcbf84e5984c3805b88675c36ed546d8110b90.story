Theo Walcott has one message to send to rivals competing for his place in the England team: Bring it on.

The Arsenal winger spent practically an entire year out for club and country, missing last summer’s World Cup in Brazil, and is only just easing himself into action.

In his absence, Raheem Sterling has emerged as one of the nation’s best players, Danny Welbeck continues to play well for England and Harry Kane has raced into contention.

Manchester United ace Wayne Rooney is a permanent fixture after being handed the England captaincy

With captain Wayne Rooney a permanent fixture on the team-sheet, England manager Roy Hodgson is not short of attacking options whatever formation he chooses to play.

But Walcott said: ‘Bring it on. Competition is always going to be there anyway. I’ve been there from 17-years-old and I’ve manage to get through it now and then.

‘Competition is healthy. We want as a nation for all the players to be playing well. It’s only going to spur you on and make you a better player.’

Harry Kane has raced into England contention this season and earned a call-up to Roy Hodgson's squad

Kane scored less than two minutes into his England debut during the 4-0 win against Lithuania 

Welbeck has continued to play well for the Three Lions despite failing to impress too many at club level

Walcott admitted he had ‘got a taste for it’ after coming on as a substitute for England in their Euro 2016 qualifier against Lithuania and is hoping for more game time in the friendly with Italy.

Spurs striker Kane also came on from the bench and continued his incredible rise this season by scoring 79 seconds into his England debut.

Kane is still only 21-years-old, whereas Walcott was thrust into the spotlight four years earlier. And Walcott warned: ’You need to make sure it doesn’t go to your head. Looking at Harry he’s not that sort of guy. He's very nice and down to earth.

But Walcott has warned Tottenham Hotspur striker Kane not to let it all go to his head 

‘Just play your football, that’s all you need to do. You don’t need to worry about anything else. You can see he’s playing with a smile on his face every day. You see it in training. As long as he continues to do that, the best will come from him.’

‘He’s had a lot of experience in the Premier League already. Being top-goalscorer as well. It’s only going to make him into a better player. If he’ s right up there with the best, he’ll believe he is the best. It’s only good for England.’
