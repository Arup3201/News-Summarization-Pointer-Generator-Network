Ndriem Sadushi was convicted in his absence in Albania of three murders and one attempted murder and is fighting extradition

An Albanian gangster convicted of three murders is still in the UK almost a year after his arrest and is now likely to claim asylum.

Ndricim Sadushi, 42, has been on the run for 15 years and is receiving legal aid in his fight against extradition back to Albania that is costing the UK taxpayer tens of thousands of pounds.

His case has been listed before judges 19 times during the lengthy court battle.

Westminster Magistrates' Court heard today there is a 'suggestion' he will appeal for asylum.

Sadushi was convicted in his absence in Albania of three murders and one attempted murder in 1997.

His case is being held up while assessments are carried out on his mental health.

At the hearing, Sadushi was ordered back to Belmarsh Prison, having spent just over a month undergoing assessments at Broadmoor mental hospital.

Anne Marie Kundert, for the Albanian 
government, said: 'This case has not been able to proceed as Mr Sadushi 
has been committed to Broadmoor hospital under the mental health act.

'There is a an assessment of his mental health due to be completed on March 11.

'There is also the suggestion he has applied for asylum and the consequences that may have.

'That is why the case has not proceeded towards a hearing at this stage.'

Westminster Magistrates' Court was told there was a 'suggestion' that Sadushi will claim for asylum

He was arrested in north London last April when he was named as one of Europe's most wanted men.

Flanked by five prison office and speaking through an interpreter, when asked for his date of birthÂ  Sadushi told the court he could not remember.

Sporting a bushy beard and a large bandage on his forehead, Sadushi mumbled incoherently through proceedings.

He is also wanted in Italy having been found guilty of controlling prostitutes and drug trafficking.

The hearing for his extradition to Italy has been set for August 1, though the Albanian hearing will have to be heard first, the court heard.

A further court date has been set for February 7 at Westminster Magistrates' Court.
