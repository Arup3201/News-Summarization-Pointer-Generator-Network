A Las Vegas woman caught on tape setting fire to the pet store she owned with 27 dogs still inside failed to sway the court by revealing her pregnancy Wednesday.

Gloria Eun Hye Lee, 36, was given 5 to 14 years in prison at a sentencing hearing after announcing she was three months pregnant.

Prosecutor Shanon Clowers called Lee's last minute revelation that she was pregnant by her estranged husband an attempt to get a 'get out of jail free card.'

Unswayed: Gloria Eun Hye Lee, 36, was given 5 to 14 years in prison after announcing she was three months pregnant at her sentencing hearing Wednesday

Security cameras in Prince and Princess pet store, in southwest Las Vegas, recorded Lee back in January 2014 removing files from the store before Kirk Bills, set to be sentenced Monday, set it on fire.

Prosecutors said that Bills had poured flammable liquid on the floor and laid out newspaper in front of kennels where 25 puppies and 2 adult dogs were crated. 

The blaze triggered the building's sprinkler system, which extinguished the flames before firefighters even arrived on the scene, leaving the animals unharmed.

Lee took a plea deal in October that included pleading guilty to arson, insurance fraud and attempted animal cruelty charges in exchange for prosecutors dropping 28 more charges. 

Clark County District Court Judge David Barker told Lee that the pregnancy announcement was part of a 'continued effort by you to influence this process.' 

The sentence handed down on Wednesday was close to the maximum Clowers sought. 

Safe and sound: The puppies were rescued, first by the sprinkler system and then by firefighters responding to the blaze

Adopted: The 25 puppies went to homes after a drawing, held as a benefit for local shelter Lied Animal Shelter while two adult dogs were placed with families

Caught: Security footage showed an individual wearing a hood spreading liquid and newspaper and lighting the store on fire. Bills pleaded guilty to arson and attempted animal cruelty in October.

The Las Vegas Review Journal reported that Lee had originally posted $40,000 bail and was on house arrest until February, when Clowers filed a criminal complaint with 31 charges.

27 of those charges were divided among each one of the puppies at the store, which landed Lee back in jail with bail set at $310,000.

Lee had a history of convictions in California stretching back to 1999 on charges of forgery, larceny from a bank and escape.

The trial brought protests from animal rights groups, which appeared in front of the courthouse at most of Lee's and Bills' appearances.

The 25 puppies taken from the store were adopted for $250 each after a drawing was held March 2014, with the proceeds going to Lied Animal Shelter. 

Charity Home 4 Spot placed the two adult dogs with families.
