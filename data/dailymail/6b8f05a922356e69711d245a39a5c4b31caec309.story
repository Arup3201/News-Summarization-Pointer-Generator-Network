An online campaign has been launched to buy and release a video allegedly showing the Mayor of Toronto smoking crack.

The Toronto Star newspaper and gossip 
website Gawker have organised the extraordinary whip-round in a bid to obtain the mobile phone video that purportedly features 
Rob Ford.

So far online donors have raised more than $73,000 of the $200,000 needed to buy the 90 second clip from drug dealers. 

The mayor has denied the accusations and called them 'ridiculous'.

More than $73,000 has been raised to buy a video allegedly showing Toronto mayor Rob Ford smoking crack

Journalists from the Star and Gawker 
say they have seen the clip and said it was taken by a man who claimed 
he sold crack to Ford.

The media outlets have jointly organised the Rob Ford Crackstarter campaign on crowdsourcing website Indiegogo.

It
is being sold by a dealer, believed to be from the city's Somali 
community, who said he wants the money to get out of Toronto and begin a
new life elsewhere.

In brief comments outside his office, Ford said it was 'another story with respect to the Toronto Star going after
me. And that's all I've got to say for now.'

Toronto police spokesman Mark Pugash said investigators were 'monitoring the situation closely.'

The Star said that two reporters 
watched a video that appears to show Ford, sitting in a chair, inhaling 
from what appears to be a glass crack pipe. The Star said it did not 
obtain the video or pay to watch it.

The Star also reported that Ford made an
anti-gay slur against the leader of the federal Liberal Party of 
Canada, Justin Trudeau.

It is also alleged that Ford says: 'Everyone expects me to be right-wing'.

Gawker
editor John Cook said the video is well-lit and alleges that Ford is 
seen laughing while holding what appears to be a crack pipe.

Ford said the allegations are 'ridiculous'. The Toronto Star and Gawker are raising money to buy the clip

He said on Indiegogo: '[Ford] is red-faced and sweaty, heaving with each breath. Finally, he finds his moment and lights up. He inhales.'

The two organisations said they wanted to buy the video so Toronto residents can watch it themselves.

Both agencies said if $200,000 was not raised within eight days, the funds would be donated to a drugs treatment charity.

Ford did not respond to the Associated Press's messages seeking comment.

The mayor has been embroiled in a number of controversies since he was elected in 2010.

The
Toronto Star reported earlier this year that he was asked to leave a 
gala fundraiser for wounded Canadian soldiers because he appeared 
intoxicated.

During 
his campaign for mayor, Ford held a news conference to discuss a 1999 
arrest for marijuana possession in Florida. He ultimately pleaded guilty
to driving under the influence and failing to give a breath sample to 
police.

While in 
office, he has been accused of flouting conflict of interest rules and 
making obscene gestures at residents from his car.

Ford,
a city councilor for years, once said Toronto would be better off if it
didn't accept more immigrants. Half of the city's population was born 
outside Canada.

Toronto
deputy mayor Doug Holyday questioned the authenticity of the video, 
saying 'video can be altered' and 'drug dealers can't be trusted.'

Holyday
said he has not spoken to Ford or his staff since the allegations 
surfaced, but noted he still believes in the mayor 'at this point.'

'I wouldn't want my career or my credibility resting on the word of drug dealers,' Holyday said.

Last week, Ford's lawyer, Dennis Morris, told the Toronto Sun that the mayor is denying 'any such allegation.'

'We're
just trying to see whether or not such a video exists and whether or 
not any video has been doctored or altered,' Morris told the Toronto 
Sun.

The controversy 
has drawn comparisons to the 1990 arrest of then-Washington Mayor Marion
Barry, who was videotaped smoking crack cocaine in a hotel room during 
an FBI sting operation.

Barry
served six months in federal prison on a misdemeanor drug possession 
conviction and later won a fourth term as mayor in 1994.
