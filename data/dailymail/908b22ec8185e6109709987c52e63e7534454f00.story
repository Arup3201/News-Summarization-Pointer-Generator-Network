A jilted Chinese man has spent £24,000 on hundreds of tickets for the new Transformers film - just to prove to his ex-girlfriend how rich he has become.

The businessman block-booked the screenings of Transformers: Age of Extinction - seven years after his lover dumped him when he was unable to afford to take her out to watch a film.

He snapped up hundreds of tickets at four of Beijing’s six IMAX theatres for the movie, which stars Mark Wahlberg and Jessica Gomes, in a bid to prove how successful he had become since she left him.

And to hammer home the point, he then decided to give them all away for free on the internet – sparking a frenzy on Chinese social media, the South China Morning Post reports.

The website, which gives the man's surname as Wang, reports how his girlfriend ditched him and moved from their home city of Nanjing to Beijing.

But after ‘striving hard for seven years’ and setting up his own company in Shanghai, he was able to spend 250,000 yuan (around £24,000) on the tickets - said to be half his monthly earnings.

He is said to have written on his Weibo account: ‘I only want to say that you might have been wrong when you made that decision,’ before offering the tickets for free in return for his message being shared.

His post quickly went viral on the internet in China.

The South China Morning Post said that as of Thursday, the comments had been shared more than 110,000 times and drawn around 35,000 comments while more than 1,590 bloggers had picked up a free ticket.
