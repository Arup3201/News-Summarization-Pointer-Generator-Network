An aid worker who has seen the deadly effects of the fast-spreading Ebola virus in West Africa says there is 'no reason' why Australian military troops cannot join the fight to stop the outbreak.

Australian Ali Readhead's comments comes after Labor deputy leader Tanya Plibersek said the government was not doing enough to assist the growing health threat.

So far Australia's efforts to tackle Ebola is focussed on hospitals and airports as a deal is sought to ensure health workers sent to Africa can be quickly evacuated and treated.

Perth woman Ali Readhead has been working in Sierra Leone for two years, and more recently has seen the devastating effect the Ebola outbreak is having on the region

Ms Readhead penned a opinion-editorial saying to government had no excuse for not sending military experts to West Africa to help fight the outbreak, urging to follow their northern hemisphere counterparts. 

'First, Australia doesn't need to commit large numbers of military doctors and nurses in order to make a difference.' she wrote.

'The U.K. is sending 460 medics to Sierra Leone in five-week rotations - meaning that over a period of six months there will be no more than 92 medics in country at any one time.

'These medics are being deployed specifically to train national health workers to run the five new treatment facilities being built. 

'U.K. medics will not be treating Ebola patients and will return to the U.K .after the training. This approach works because Ebola is a straightforward virus to treat, requiring basic level health workers who are readily available in Sierra Leone. 

'There is no reason why the Australian Government can't take the same approach to the provision of medical care.'  

The disease is spreading fast without the appropriate resources to contain those infected

Ms Readhead also criticised Kennedy MP Bob Katter's reaction to the Ebola scare in Cairns involving Red Cross Australia volunteer nurse Sue Ellen Kovack last week.

'How did Australia respond? Federal MP Bob Katter has accused Ms Kovack of putting Australia at risk because of her "humanitarian ambitions",' Ms Readhead wrote. 

The federal opposition says the $18 million provided by the coalition government to tackle the virus, which is killing thousands of people in west Africa, is not enough.

Labor deputy leader Tanya Plibersek believes Australia should be sending in health workers and other experts to help fight Ebola, which presents a threat to health and international security.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott said the aid spending, which came on top of $40 million for the World Health Organisation, was a creditable effort so far.

Mr Abbott thinks it is irresponsible to send in Australian personnel without an agreement to fly them out immediately and get them quickly to a high-quality hospital if they contracted the virus.   

In Sierra Leone there are only 30 beds available for Ebola patients, so hundreds more are forced to stay at home until people die and free up space in the hospitals

Ms Readhead's op-ed comes after the aid worker said the area was completely unprepared to deal with the crisis.

Originally from Perth in Western Australia, Ms Readhead has been living in Sierra Leone for the past two years and has seen first hand the devastation the disease is causing.

'It's chaos. They're totally under-resourced,' she told Daily Mail Australia last month.

'Patients are getting left in their houses because we just don't have any room.'

In the capital city, Freetown, there are only 30 beds available to those with Ebola, despite there being thousands of people infected or suspected to have contracted the potentially fatal virus.

'They're just waiting for people to die to free up the beds,' Ms Readhead said. 

Ms Readhead originally moved to Freetown to work on the women and children's health policy, but when Ebola began to spread received a direct request from the Minister of Health in Sierra Leone to help fight the disease.

But she believed the only real way to contain the virus was if Australia and other nations sent expert military medical teams to set up field hospitals and isolation centres, two things which Freetown need so desperately. 

'The only way we have a chance of containing this outbreak is if we deploy military', Ms Readhead said before adding that they would be able to accommodate a level of risk humanitarian aid can't.

The aid worker has started a petition which has already garnered over 33,000 signatures, urging Foreign Minister Julie Bishop to do more than financially support the situation.

'I've never been more devastated in my life. Last week I returned to Perth after working with the health ministry in Sierra Leone – witnessing first hand how the deadly Ebola virus is spiralling out of control and killing hundreds.' 

'It's terrifying, and to be honest I'm not sure anyone knows when or how it'll end. What I saw will stay with me forever – in some places there aren't enough ambulances to pick up those infected or bury the dead,' Ms Readhead wrote on Change.org.

Ms Readhead said she believed there was hesitation in sending personnel overseas as there was a risk of infection.

The reality is less than ten aid workers have contracted Ebola, and if isolation facilities were set up alongside US and the UK in West Africa treatment would be incredibly easy.

Ms Readhead also revealed the wider devastation the spread of Ebola was having on the community, economy, and already struggling healthcare system.

People are terrified to visit hospitals, which is having devastating effects on the number of people accessing the health facilites, a problem the region has already been battling with for years.

'Pregnant ladies are giving birth at home, if your baby has malaria you don't take them to the hospital', Ms Readhead revealed.

'The hospitals are empty beside Ebola patients.'

She also told of how tough the struggle was to break down the stigma around accessing healthcare services, and how the disease is quickly unravelling all the hard work.

One in eight women died during childbirth before the government introduced free healthcare for pregnant women. 

This is worst outbreak of Ebola the region has ever seen, and the first time it has appeared in such an urban and highly populated area.

If it is not contained soon, the projection is grim. Authorities believe it could spread to more than 1.4 million people across the region if urgent and desperately needed help is not received.

The reason the virus is spreading so quickly is the close communities without standalone houses and the close proximity of marketplaces with many people packed into them allow it to spread with much greater ease.

'We don't have that level of contact in Australia... (and) we've got the medical expertise to be able to put in place the correct procedures', Ms Readhead said when asked if Ebola could post a threat to her home country.

Despite the devastating health implications, the aid worker insisted there is much more at stake than the terrible loss of life.

Already unstable economies in the region are likely to crumble under the pressure, and this process has already begun

Mining companies completing projects in West Africa have pulled workers out of the area in fear of Ebola, and others with 'investments in the pipelines are being disbanded.' 

The disease has already claimed hundreds of lives in countries in the area, and could claim many more if urgent action is not taken, Ms Readhead warned.

'It can definitely be contained... if we have beds for suspected or confirmed patients, healthworkers who are able to treat them.

'Unless we have those two things on the ground we don't stand a chance.'   

More than 700 people have arrived at Australian airports from west African countries since the outbreak.

The 11 arrivals suspected of Ebola have all tested negative.

Most of the estimated 4,500 Ebola cases worldwide have been in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, but Nigeria, Senegal, Spain and US have also recorded cases.
