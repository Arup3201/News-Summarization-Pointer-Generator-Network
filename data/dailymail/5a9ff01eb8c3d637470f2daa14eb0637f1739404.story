World markets tumbled back into the red today as fears grew Spain will need an EU bailout.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down more than 1 per cent on doubts the nation will be able to afford to recapitalise its fourth biggest lender Bankia.

There are also increasing worries that other Spanish banks will also need bailing out.

Banned: Spain's plan to recapitalise its troubled lender Bankia through a ¿19billion 'backdoor bailout' has been rejected as 'unacceptable' by European banking officials

The FTSE 100 Index was nearly 2 per 
cent or 96.8 points lower at 5295.3 as Spain saw the yield on its 
10-year bonds rise to a record euro-era high of 6.68 per cent at one 
stage.

This is close to the 7 per cent level
that pushed Greece, Ireland and Portugal into taking a bailout in a 
sign that investors had little faith in the country's ability to deal 
with its debts.

Chris Beauchamp, market analyst at IG
Index, said: 'Investor confidence wanes by the day, and it could only 
be a matter of time before the Spanish government is forced to ask for 
financial aid.'

The ongoing eurozone crisis was also 
evident in Italy, which saw borrowing costs rise at a debt auction, 
affecting banking shares on London's leading shares index.

Markets in Europe were also sharply lower, with Germany's Dax and France's Cac-40 off nearly 2 per cent.

In London, the uncertainty in Spain 
hit banking stocks as Lloyds Banking Group dropped 2 per cent or 0.6p to
25.4p, Royal Bank of Scotland fell 0.5p to 20.1p and Barclays shed 1.3p
to 179.7p.

Rejected: Madrid said it wanted to inject the amount in sovereign bonds into the bank's parent firm, and then swap it for cash at the European Central Bank's three-month refinancing window

However, there was good news for the Government as its borrowing costs fell to an all-time low of 1.73% as investors sought a safe-haven.

The tumble came as Spain's plan to 
recapitalise its troubled lender Bankia through a €19billion 'backdoor 
bailout' was rejected as 'unacceptable' by European banking officials.

Madrid said it wanted to inject the 
amount in sovereign bonds into the bank's parent firm, and then swap it 
for cash at the European Central Bank's three-month refinancing window.

This would, it said, avoid the need to raise the money on bond markets.

Spain's woes, combined with growing uncertainty about whether Greece will remain in the eurozone, has reignited the 17-nation currency bloc's debt crisis on nervous financial markets, prompting calls for more radical EU action.   

European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso called yesterday for European leaders to agree on a path to full economic union to reassure investors about the future of the euro area.      

He said: 'It is very important, even if you believe that it doesn't come immediately, to define the trend, the objective.

'It is very important also in terms of confidence for the investment in the euro area now.

'We will support an ambitious and structural approach which should include a roadmap and a timetable for a full economic and monetary union in the euro area.'

But, a major survey released yesterday showed support for European integration has fallen sharply across the 27-nation European Union since the debt crisis began.

It has raised doubts about the political will for closer economic union.

But
the ECB said a proper capital injection was needed for the country's 
fourth largest banking institution, reports the Financial Times.

And it added that the plans could 
breach an EU ban on 'monetary financing'. Policymaker Ewald Nowotny 
added : 'It is up to national governments to help banks.'

Keith Bowman, equity analyst at 
Hargreaves Lansdown, said: 'We have seen that the U.S. and the UK have 
made substantial moves in terms of recapitalising their banks.

'The difficulty is, the longer you leave it, the more difficult fund raising becomes and that's what Spain is finding now.

'There
have been some requests for the bailout fund to be used to help Spanish
banks to recapitalise, but the difficulty for the European Central Bank
(ECB) is to know where that stops.

'There are a lot of people who would even question whether the bailout fund is big enough to rescue Spain.'

Spain will now issue new bonds to fund it ailing lenders and indebted regions.

Foreign minister Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo said it would nurse hundreds of billions of euros worth of toxic assets from a 2008 real estate bust without international help.   

But there are fears the move will dent the country's strong liquidity position and further worsen public finances under scrutiny from investors and European officials.

It could also weigh on the capacity of the state to finance itself.                

Spain has already completed more than 55 per cent of its debt issuance for the year and has at least €20billion euros in its coffers.

That is on top of more than €4billion still available in the bank restructuring fund, making it possible to recapitalise the ailing lenders and repay debt.                

However, the central government and regions still have to refinance €98billion out of €117.5billion of debt maturing in 2012 and fund a deficit of €52billion.

The next three months, with €38billion to refinance by August, and a second hump in October, when €28billions is due, will be especially difficult.               

The funding situation is also growing tense in the autonomous regions, with €12billion of debt maturing in the last quarter, more than half of it in the two most-indebted regions, Catalonia and Valencia.      

In the latest sign of tensions within Spain over the state of the economy and the banks, Bank of Spain governor Miguel Angel Fernandez Ordonez announced yesterday he would step down on June 10, one month earlier than the end of his mandate.          

Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy has said repeatedly - most recently on Monday - his government does not need outside financial help, but most economists disagree.           

'The point about Spain is it's going to need some external support of some form,' said David Owen, chief European financial economist at Jefferies.                 

'Whether that implies the European Central Bank buys bonds (in the secondary market) or moves lock, stock and barrel to quantitative easing over the next three months, certainly the situation at the moment is not sustainable.'

Spain has been on an austerity drive to improve its finances but this had deepened a recession and worsened unemployment now affecting a quarter of the workforce and led to protests.

Retail sales slumped by 9.8 per cent on the year in April, the biggest fall since the series began in 2003.
