Justin Bieber’s bad boy father has split from the mother of his two young children and has apparently chosen a life of partying with his superstar son instead.

Jeremy Bieber, 39, who was with Justin when he was arrested for drag racing last month, ended his seven-year romance with Erin Wagner and the pair are living apart, sharing custody of Jaxon, 4, and Jazmyn, 5.

It is unclear when the couple split, but friends have said their relationship has been struggling for some time and rumors of a break up have circulated before.

Split: Justin enjoys a sushi lunch with his father and Erin and their two children in happier times. Jeremy is living apart from Erin but they are sharing custody of the children, who Justin adores

Part of the family: A source told MailOnline that Erin and Justin are still great friends and that she is still on good terms with Jeremy despite the split 

But the couple were regularly pictured together until late last year and spent Thanksgiving with each other. 

Sources say Erin – who is incredibly close to Justin – couldn’t handle Jeremy constantly going away with the pop star and living the high-life.

The situation seemed to really start getting to the 27-year-old in the days leading up to Justin’s Miami arrest as she made a series of emotional tweets saying how unhappy she was.

On January 16 she wrote ‘this is all I need’ and posted a longing quotation: ‘I don’t need a perfect one.. I just need someone who can make me feel like I’m the only one’.

A week later Justin, 19, was arrested in Miami Beach, Florida, on suspicion of driving under the influence, driving with an expired license and resisting arrest without violence. Jeremy had accompanied his son on the controversial break.

Tattooed Jeremy – who has been jailed at least twice in the past – was heavily criticised in the wake of the incident with Justin’s millions of fans accusing him of being a terrible influence.

It was even suggested he was in an SUV blocking the street to allow the drag race.

The day after Justin was released from custody on a $2,500 bond, the father and son pair were pictured out partying.

Under the influence: A source told MailOnline: 'If you look at a lot of Justin’s 
controversial incidents over the past few months, Jeremy has been in the
 background. That is very worrying'. Police yesterday released footage of Bieber walking the line after his arrest

And then on January 31, Jeremy was present again when his son was accused of smoking marijuana on a private flight and verbally abusing a flight attendant.

It seems everything got too much for Erin during that turbulent period and four days after the DUI arrest she wrote: ‘Hard to believe sometimes that things can get better! Trying to keep going!’

She followed that up with: ‘Ready for the next chapter.....wonder what it's about....#unknown’.

This is not the first time Jeremy’s wild behavior has affected his family life for the worse. He split from Justin’s mother, Pattie Mallette, just 10 months after she had given birth to the future global superstar following a troubled on off relationship.

According to Pattie’s autobiography, The Only Way Is Up, the teenagers were actually engaged, but called off the wedding when Jeremy cheated on her with a mutual acquaintance.

She also claims Jeremy was in the county jail for fighting the day Justin was born and that he often let his son down, regularly failing to turn up when he was due to take him out for the day.

A source told MailOnline: ‘Jeremy has always been a bad boy. When he first got together with Pattie he was a big drinker and loved to party.

Blood: Justin and Jeremy got matching tattoos. Those close to them say he's more of a friend than a father

‘He has always adored his son, but he wasn’t mature enough to be a responsible parent and his lifestyle meant he couldn’t be there for him like a father should be.

‘He got in trouble with the police and would often leave town, sometimes for months at a time.

‘And if the truth be told his attitude towards partying and living the high-life has never changed.

Again, he adores Jaxon and Jazmyne, in fact they are incredibly important to him, but that hasn’t altered his personality.

‘Justin hitting the big time in the way he has is an absolute dream come true for Jeremy and the temptation of being able to travel the globe, living like a superstar was too much to turn down.

‘Erin was always going to take second place to that. They are still on good terms for the sake of the children and she still has a great friendship with Justin, but their relationship has broken down.

‘Jeremy has the opportunity to party with beautiful girls in every city in the world. He was never going to let anything get in the way of that.’ 

The source added: ‘The fact Jeremy cannot seem to maintain a relationship is just another sign of how flaky he can be. He really isn’t the kind if role model Justin needs around him during this difficult time.

Lonely: Erin and Jeremy have had an up and down relationship. They spent Thankgiving last year together, but then around the time of Justin's arrest in Miami she began posting some emotional tweets

Looking for love: Her postings made it very clear that she was no longer in a relationship

‘Jeremy is more of a friend than a father. Far from trying to keep Justin on the straight and narrow he is often the one encouraging him.’

Throughout their relationship Erin has been referred to as Jeremy’s wife, although it is unclear if they ever actually got married. They met around seven years ago in the Mitchell, Ontario area, before Justin hit the big time.

Soon after first getting together they moved West to Winnipeg and started a family. But when Justin’s career really started to take off in around 2010, Jeremy decided to move back to Stratford, bringing Erin with him.

Initially they had their own place, but last year Justin bought his dad an $850,000 farm house on the outskirts of Stratford, just a few plots away from another property he bought for his maternal grandparents Diane and Bruce Dale.

Sources close to Jeremy have told MailOnline he regularly boasts about receiving a massive $50,000 allowance from his son to help him pay for the upkeep of the mansion, which Justin also uses as a base when he is back in his home country of Canada.

Jeremy – who uses some of the money to pay for a private butler - is known for having wild parties at the property, which he and his friends call, ‘the ranch’.

Erin is still a regular visitor to the luxury pad, but she now has her own place and works for technology company Fibernetics in nearby Kitchener. Her family all live in Cypress Texas, having relocated there from Burlington, Ontario.

She has been a regular fixture in Justin’s life, often going with the family to glitzy awards ceremonies, and many saw her as a positive influence.

Justin is also incredibly close to his two younger siblings.

His father on the other hand is generally seen as a bad role model. There is no official recording of his time in jail at the time of Justin’s birth – although records are expunged after a certain period of time in Canada.

But he has got other offenses on his rap sheet. In 1997 he was convicted of assault and sentenced to 90 days in prison.

Two years later he spent another 21 days in jail after violating his probation. He was also convicted of a second probation violation at the same time.

Then in January 2004 he was charged with assault again, but the case was dismissed.

Despite his criminal past Justin still seems to look up to his wayward father. Even though they were out of contact for extended periods during his childhood, Justin gave an interview saying: ‘I have a great relationship with my dad.

‘When I was younger, he taught me how to play some songs on the guitar, like ‘Knockin’ on Heaven’s Door’ by Bob Dylan. He taught me how to drive too.’

Days after his Miami arrest he tweeted: ‘I have the greatest Dad in the world. He’s taught me how to love, learn, and stay true to myself. I will forever be grateful because he was my superhero #batman.’

But far from keep his son out of trouble, often, when Justin hits the headlines for the wrong reason Jeremy isn’t too far away.

The two were photographed together at a Maple Leafs hockey game in Toronto Dec. 29, just hours before a limo driver called cops to report he was assaulted in a car carrying Bieber.

The driver said he was driving Justin and his entourage away from the Air Canada Centre after the game when an unidentified member of the group attacked him. Justin was charged with assault late last month.

Jeremy also was with Justin and his son’s pal Lil Za in San Francisco on January 6, three days before the singer allegedly threw more than a dozen raw eggs at his neighbor’s house in Calabasas, Calif.

The day of the alleged egging, Jeremy posted a Twitter photo of himself and Justin smirking for a camera with the caption: “Father like son. Son like father.”

A source said: ‘If you look at a lot of Justin’s controversial incidents over the past few months, Jeremy has been in the background. That is very worrying.’
