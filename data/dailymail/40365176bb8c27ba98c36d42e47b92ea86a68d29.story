A light trail fizzes across the Millennium Bridge, while in the background St Paul's is barely visible under the night sky.

This electrifying image was among 1,500 entries in a photography competition by Beefeater Gin to 'bottle the spirit of London'.

The bridge scene - which took first place in the results announced today - was shot by Reema Sharma of Lambeth, south-west London, who experimented with light by using a long exposure.

Millennium Bridge by Reema Sharma of Lambeth, south-west London. Entrants in the '#MyLondon' contest were asked to supply a short narrative with their image. She said: 'London is an experiment with light, on the Millennium Bridge facing St Paul's'

Battersea Power Station, by Neil Sharpe of Croydon, south London. He said: 'My London is Battersea power station from the train to Croydon'. This and all entrants below were runners-up

Panoramic view - including the Shard and City Hall (left of the Thames, and, right the 'Walkie Talkie' under construction) - by Kestutis Balciunas of Buckhurst Hill, Essex. 'My London is a city which changes its face every day'

Among the other scenes snapped in the '#MyLondon' contest were Big Ben, Hampstead Heath, Portobello Road, Greenwich and Regent's Canal.

Each photographer provided a short narrative to accompany their work, describing what the capital means to them.

Helen McAleer, from Tower Hamlets, east London, who took a shot of Canary Wharf, wrote: 'My London is relaxing among the hustle and bustle of it all and remembering what a beautiful world we live in!'

And Tom Dunster, from Southwark, south of the Thames, snapped the London Eye bathed in a red light.

He said: 'My London is an exciting mix of old and 
new, as captured by this view from the South Bank. The city is at its 
vibrant best at night, when it comes to life.'

Greenwich Sunset, by Nicola White of Greenwich, south-east London. 'Mudlarking and looking for old treasures at low tide along the banks of the River Thames in Greenwich. Living in the present whilst revelling in history!'

Portobello Road market, by Karen Morris of Stratford. 'My London is unique and vibrant'

Red Wheel, by Tom Dunster of Southwark, south-east London. 'My London is an exciting mix of old and new, as captured by this view from the South Bank. The city is at its vibrant best at night, when it comes to life'

Among the runners-up were a picture of Battersea Power Station on a cloudy day, a silhouette of Tower Bridge and a colourful Chelsea Flower Show.

One haunting long exposure shot, taken by Sandra Cockayne of Bradford, West Yorkshire, shows an 'invisible' double decker pulling up outside the Houses of Parliament.

The 20 best entries are set to 
receive a limited-edition photographic print, while the overall winner 
gets a top-of-the-range SLR camera.

And Beefeater is well placed to run such a contest - as every drop of its gin, exported around the world, is produced at its distillery in Kennington, London, near the River Thames.
