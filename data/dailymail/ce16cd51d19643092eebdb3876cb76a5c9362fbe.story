From getting rid of wrinkles within 30 days to firming up your jawline in just two weeks, beauty companies are famous for their bold claims.

But while such bold claims may have made it into the 21st century, thankfully, some of the more outlandish methods to prove them did not.

Among the more bizarre - and terrifying - is the 'atomic test' devised by one beauty company, which involved slathering a model's face with radioactive dust and using a Geiger counter to see how much of it cleansing removed.

Radioactive: The hapless model's face is checked for atomic dust using a 1950's Geiger counter

The makers of Dorothy Grey Cold Cream used four different products to remove the dangerous dust - including their own.

Using a Geiger counter, a device used by scientists to measure the amount of radiation in a given location, the company was able to prove that their cold cream removed more atomic dust than the three nameless products also used.

Those tempted to buy the cold cream could then write to Dorothy Grey for a free 'atomic test booklet', outlining the details of the experiment.

Although the advertisement claimed that most of the dust had been removed from the hapless model's face, the truth remains that even small amounts are enough to lead to serious health problems.

Most experts agree even low doses of radiation can dramatically increase the risk of cancer and the risk of cancer increases as the dose of radiation increases.

Exposure to radiation over time is estimated to increase the lifetime risk of fatal cancer by around five per cent on average.

The shocking clip isn't the only bizarre retro beauty ad to make a resurgence.

Another unusual film is a tutorial which explains how to straighten the hair in an age before GHD hair straighteners existed.

The Pathe clip, filmed in the British Colonies Club in London, shows an African woman having her naturally curly hair straightened - accompanied by commentary that sounds jarringly old fashioned to modern ears.

'Now for an eye opener on women's top question: hair,' the commentary begins. 'Most hairdressers spend their time putting curls into women's hair and keeping them there long enough to justify all the talk about permanent waves.

'Here at the British Colonies Club, we met a hair expert who does permanent waving in reverse. Her clients are Africans and they are all born with a permanent wave but do they like it? They're women, aren't they?

'Round they come to the club in England to be un-permed. The idea is to take out all the kinks in the hair and give it a permanent straight look.'

The advice includes soaking the hair with a selection of 'secret oils' before splitting it into six and straightening it with combs heated on a stove.

Unknown: The advice calls for a 'secret blend' of hair straightening oils to be slathered over the scalp

Sleek: Combs heated on a brazier were used to get rid of natural curls in a process that took two hours

Complete: The finished look was typical of the post-war period with smooth waves and elaborate fringe

Errol Douglas, a London-based Afro hair specialist, comments: 'What an amazing film, I love the 40s and 50s as an era. 

'The negatives about the film are firstly how we take care of clients. Service levels have changed immeasurably too.

'In the film the stylist pulls the client’s head forward – this would never ever happen today. 

'Whether washing, styling or putting any products in the hair, you always pull back to avoid anything going in the client's eyes. 

'I think in this day and age Trading Standards would have a lot to say about putting ‘secret oils’ in a client’s hair. 

'With all hair products, you must give the client all the information and be completely transparent regarding the product’s content. 

Despite the downsides, says Douglas, the neatly waved result is surprisingly up to date and on trend for 2013.

'This look however works really well for young, on-trend women in the same way that Adele rocked a beehive early in her career.

'For those who don’t fall into that category, it's better to go for a look that suits you rather than listening to fashion.

'It’s interesting and influential but it should help you shape your own sense of style.'
