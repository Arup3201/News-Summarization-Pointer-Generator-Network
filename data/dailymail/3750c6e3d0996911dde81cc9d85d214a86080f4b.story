It was ugly, it was somewhat lucky, but Hull City found victory in a game Steve Bruce called one of the biggest of his tenure to intensify Aston Villa’s relegation fears.

A good occasion for Bruce to end his personal hoodoo against Paul Lambert, this his first Premier League win over his rival manager at the fifth attempt.

Lambert is now under immense pressure to find a way of averting a Villa slide that grows increasingly alarming. When Dame N’Doye added a late second to Nikica Jelavic’s opening strike, a banner reading ‘Lambert Out’ was unfurled in the away section. Chants of ‘Sacked in the morning’ were sung.

The final whistle brought more calls from the travelling fans for Lambert to go. As Villa dropped into the relegation zone for the first time this season, the damning statistics mounted up. This was their 15th Premier League match without scoring, their tenth consecutive match without a win.

Hull fans taunted Lambert, asking for a wave as their team coasted to victory in the closing stages. True, Allan McGregor pulled off a marvellous double save to deny Ashley Westwood from range then Christian Benteke from closer.

But Abel Hernandez could have made this worse for Villa had he not lashed a shot wide when clean through.

Bruce used his programme notes to describe this game as ‘mammoth’ for both clubs. Certainly of huge significance in the fight against relegation, the encounter also had an ice-age edge, played in plunging temperatures.

The Hull manager would have been heartened to be able to start N’Doye, his £3million deadline day signing, up front for the first time. Having come on as a substitute in the draw at Manchester City, the Senegal striker began his full debut impressively, holding up the ball and looking for quick passes to his partner Jelavic.

For the visitors, Lambert selected Scott Sinclair from the off, his first start in the Premier League since at West Bromwich Albion in December 2013 - also against Hull, coincidentally.

Tom Cleverley was dropped to the bench by Lambert for the first time since joining on loan from Manchester United, ending rumours he was contractually obliged to play.

Cleverley began in the dugout sitting alongside Benteke - once more out of the team - and club captain Ron Vlaar, who has lost his place following injury. All three would have been perceived as essential at the start of the season.

While Villa controlled large periods of possession their attacks failed to trouble the Hull defence, a consistent theme of their slide into trouble over recent months. Any shots came from range and were usually off target.

Bruce’s team operated largely on the counter and were more incisive. Twice Jelavic would have been clear were it not for the quick thinking of Villa goalkeeper Brad Guzan.

In the 22th minute however, the American was left stranded. N’Doye slipped a pass to Jelavic who advanced into the box and struck a left-foot shot. Ciaran Clark slid to block but succeeded only in looping the ball over Guzan and into the net.

Hugely fortunate and potentially hugely important. The KC Stadium, scene of only two previous Hull victories, let out a roar.

It could have swiftly got better for those home fans. Ahmed Elmohamady swung over a cross that found N’Doye free but he miscued his header horribly wide.

Carles Gil was once again Villa’s most creative player, brave on the ball and in the challenge, despite his diminutive stature. He even squared up to Tom Huddlestone after one tackle.

Fight perhaps, but little finesse for Villa. A signal of their listless attack came when Fabian Delph shot aimlessly from 30 yards. As the ball drifted well wide, the home fans sung ‘That’s why you’re going down.’ The same refrain was aired when Ashley Westwood sent his free-kick flying past the post.

Lambert sent Benteke on for the ineffectual Andreas Weimann at the break, aware Villa’s chances of adding to four away Premier League goals would be enhanced by the Belgian’s presence. He shot wide from 18 yards with his first touch.

Villa kept probing without purpose and Hull doubled the lead with 16 minutes to go. Elmohamady crossed, substitute Gaston Ramirez headed back and N’Doye arrived to poke home at the second attempt.
