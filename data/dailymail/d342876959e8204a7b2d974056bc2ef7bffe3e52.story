A choirmaster who had been in a coma for 10 days has recalled the remarkable moment he woke up - after his wife played a recording of his own singers in action.

Barry Todd even began whistling along as the choir performed Give a Little Whistle, from the Disney classic Pinocchio.

The 64-year-old father-of-two said: 'Music has always been my life - and now it has saved it.'

Mr Todd was lucky to survive a ruptured aortic aneurysm and had been unconscious for ten days.

He said: ‘I was a very active person, it happened totally out of the blue. I very nearly died.

‘I had been unconscious for about a 
week-and-a-half but they say hearing is the last thing to go.

'Music 
stimulates the brain and it could well have been that it helped me come 
out of it.'

He added: 'My wife played music and I began to join in and whistle.

‘I was only semi-conscious. I don’t think I even realised I was doing it.

Mr Todd, from Solihull, collapsed last October with severe back pain after suffering a ruptured aortic aneurysm.

An aortic aneurysm is a bulge in the blood vessel known as the aorta and it occurs as a result of a weakness in the blood vessel's wall.

As blood passes through the weakened blood vessel, the pressure causes it to bulge outwards like a balloon.

Occasionally, this bulge can rupture causing dangerous internal bleeding.

An aortic aneurysm is a bulge in the major blood vessel known as the aorta.

It occurs as a result of a weakness in the blood vessel's wall.

As blood passes through the weakened blood vessel, the pressure causes it to bulge outwards like a balloon.

Occasionally, this bulge can rupture causing dangerous internal bleeding.

As
 the aorta is so large, most people who experience a ruptured aortic 
aneurysm die rapidly, but some can be saved with emergency surgery.

Those
 that survive the initial rupture, are at risk of complications 
including kidney problems, organ failure and respiratory problems.

Aortic aneurysms are most common in men over the age of 65.

People are at greater risk if they smoke, are overweight and eat a high fat diet.

Mrs Todd, 53, who has three grown-up children from a previous marriage, said: 'Barry had woken in the night complaining of excruciating back pain.

'In the morning it hadn't got any better so I called the paramedics.

'They came and said it might be kidney stones so he was taken to hospital by ambulance.

'I followed in the car behind because I thought he would be discharged soon but he didn't even get out of the ambulance.

'He was taken straight to Coventry hospital and rushed into theatre.

'The doctors told me to get the family together and prepare for the worst. They even asked us if we wanted a priest to come in to read Barry his last rites.

'We were devastated. For days he just lay in a coma and we did everything we could to stay positive. I played him the choir's CDs for hours and sang to him as well.

'Something inside me made me sure that if anything was going to get him out of his coma it would be music.

'Music
 has been such a huge part of his life and we are just delighted he woke
 up. He has a long way to go but he's alive and that's the most 
important thing. It's a miracle.'

Mr Todd needed 12 operations as he recovered at Coventry’s University Hospital.

Doctors were also forced to amputate his left leg after he developed a blood clot and also had to remove most of his bowel.

However, he hopes to be able to stand and conduct one of Midland Voices’ three choirs at a concert later this month.

‘To be able to rehearse the choir is uplifting,’ Mr Todd said. ‘The music really helps the healing process.’

Mr Todd has spent his career in the entertainment business after studying the piano and trumpet at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama, in London.

He founded Midland Voices five years ago and its choirs rehearse at venues across Warwickshire.

Mrs Todd, who was forced to give up work as a music teacher to care for her husband, said: 'The choir have been wonderful.

'The managers of the concert venue where they perform have built a ramp for Barry and he will conduct the singers and orchestra from his wheelchair.

'He is so determined, music is his life.'
