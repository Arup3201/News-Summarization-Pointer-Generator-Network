Three members of the same family who relied on out-of-date supermarket food to get by have allegedly died from food poisoning. 

Enrique Caño, 61, his wife Concepción, 50, and their daughter Tamara, 14, were found dead at their home in Alcalá de Guadaíra, near Seville, on Saturday morning just hours after it is believed they ate contaminated fish.

The couple's other daughter, 13-year-old Vanessa, was also taken seriously ill and remains in intensive care in hospital.

El Mundo reports that the family turned to out-of-date food after the father lost his job as a plumber two years ago.

Their house was seized by the bank, but they continued to live in the property as de facto squatters, the Spanish daily newspaper added.

Caño was reportedly a regular visitor to food stores at closing time, joining other unemployed locals in taking expired products from staff.

He also earned money by collecting and selling second-hand clothes.

El Mundo reports that extended family members are now considering legal action against the Andalusian health service.

They claim paramedics were called to the family home early Saturday but despite the parents and children being violently ill, the decision was made not to take them to hospital.
