New York Governor Andrew Cuomo today delivered an impassioned eulogy to his father, former governor Mario Cuomo, at his funeral, calling him a 'keynote speaker for our better angels'.

In his 40-minute address at St. Ignatius Loyola Church on Manhattan's Upper East Side, the governor recalled his father's steadfast commitment to his beliefs and his own desire to continue his father's legacy, saying: 'My dad was my hero, my mentor and my confidante.'

Bill Clinton, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and former Mayor Michael Bloomberg joined Andrew Cuomo, his brother, CNN news anchor Chris Cuomo, their mother Matilda and hundreds of mourners in the snow today to bid farewell to former Governor Mario Cuomo at his funeral service. 

Draped in a New York state flag and dusted with snow, his casket was carried into the church  as dozens of state police in uniform stood at attention, and hundreds of well-wishers queued in the brisk weather to pass on their respects to the Democratic Party icon who left a progressive legacy of speaking out for the voiceless and powerless.

Following the service, Andrew Cuomo was seen holding his sobbing mother before his brother blew one final kiss to their father's casket.

Cuomo, a three-term governor, passed away at his Manhattan home from heart failure on January 1 - just hours after his son was sworn in for a second term as governor. He was 82.

In the younger Cuomo's eulogy, he said that his father was 'anything but a typical politician'.

'He believed what he believed, and the reaction of the audience or the powers that be or the popularity of his belief was irrelevant to him,' he said. 'Mario Cuomo was at peace with who he was and how he saw the world. This gave him a great strength and made him anything but a typical politician.'​ 

He added that as an immigrant's son from Queens, his father - in his words - 'was always an outsider. That's what gave him his edge'.

'At his core, he was a philosopher. He was a poet. He was an advocate. He was a crusader. Mario Cuomo was the keynote speaker for our better angels,' the younger Cuomo said in the eulogy, which spanned from his father's biggest speeches to his fierce competitiveness on the basketball court.

'He left the world a better place than when he found it,' he said. 'New York is a better state thanks to Mario Cuomo.'

He explained how, in his father's last few days, he told him that he wanted him to stay strong so that he could hold the bible at his inauguration. On January 1, he told his father he could attend a ceremony in Buffalo, New York if he didn't feel up to an earlier one in the city.

His father didn't reply, and shortly after the start of the Buffalo ceremony - which started at 4pm - he passed away at 5.30pm, Governor Cuomo said.

'He was here, he waited and then he quietly slipped out of the event and then went home,' he said. 'Just like he always did because his job was done.'

At the close of his eulogy, he asked his father to send his love to their relatives who had passed away, as well as fallen police officers, Officers Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos, who were shot dead in their patrol car in Brooklyn two weeks ago. 'Tell Ramos and Liu we miss them already,' he said. 

He went on: 'Pop, you taught us well. You inspired us. We know what we have to do and we will do it. We will make this state a better state. We will do this together. On this, you have my word, your son. I love you pop and I always will.' 

Scripture readings — some by Cuomo's daughters — included the Beatitudes, which were said to be among Cuomo's favorites, and a quote from the Book of Wisdom that begins, 'The souls of the just are in the hands of God.' 

'Mario Cuomo ever communicated a spirit of inclusivity and care, a spirit of decency and uprightness that inspired love and respect,' said the Rev. George M. Witt, the pastor of St. Ignatius, where some of Cuomo's five children are parishioners and several of his grandchildren have gone to school.

'In the end, it was not so much the eloquence of his words that spoke to us but the eloquence of his life.'

On Monday, hundreds waited in a line that stretched more than a block to pay their respects at Cuomo's wake.

Vice President Joe Biden, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, Democratic Senator Charles Schumer of New York, actor Alan Alda and former state Comptroller Carl McCall were among those who paid tribute.

Photos from Cuomo's life were displayed - him being sworn in as governor, their wedding portrait, a black-and-white image of a young Cuomo playing stickball.

Even after hours of greeting mourners, his widow, Matilda Cuomo still managed to smile as she spoke lovingly of her spouse.

'He's up there, telling God what to do. He's working with God now,' she said.

Lynda Rufo, a banker lined up outside the funeral home, said her daughter was finishing law school because of Cuomo's encouragement.

'He was a part of New York,' Rufo said. 'He always took the time to be there for everyone, no matter who you were or where you came from. He loved people.'

Cuomo was most remembered for a speech at the 1984 Democratic National Convention in San Francisco, where he focused on an America divided between haves and have-nots and scolded Republican President Ronald Reagan for not working to close that gap.

He came to his stances from personal experience, the son of an Italian immigrant father who struggled economically.
