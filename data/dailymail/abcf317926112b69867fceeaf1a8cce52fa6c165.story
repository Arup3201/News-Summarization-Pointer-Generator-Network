A Brazilian man posted a message on Facebook announcing he planned to kill his wife after discovering she was betraying him.

Hours before Franque do Nascimento Santos, 50, stabbed his wife to death he apologised to the couple’s two-year-old son.

'Son, daddy loves you. Mummy cheated on me and must pay so she will die today,' he wrote.

Horrific: The message on Facebook translates as 'Son, daddy loves you. Mummy cheated on me and must pay so she will die today'. Friends expressed their horror under the post. One wrote: 'What have you done?'

According to police, Nascimento stabbed 23-year-old Juliana Moreira de Melo three times in the neck at their home in Senador Camará, West Rio on June 1.

He then phoned a friend who took him to the local police station the following day where he confessed to the crime.

Outraged friends of the couple said they tried to call the house several times after seeing the message on Facebook, believing that it was a hoax.

They later discovered that Juliana had already died.

Detectives said Franque confirmed he had written the message after claiming he had discovered his wife in bed with another man.

The couple had been married for three years.

The victim’s cousin Mayara Vinicius Melo, 18, said: 'Juliana was not having an affair but she had become really worried about Franque’s behaviour over the last few months.

'She said he was acting strange and she was scared of him.

The cousin, who is also the child's godmother, added: 'She left home to stay with a relative for a week to give herself some space, but she returned because she missed her son so much.'

The couple were last seen together at a party together and witnesses reported Juliana didn’t want to leave with Franque, who seemed to be in a temper.

Melo said: 'Something must have snapped because he turned into a monster and killed her that night. We never thought it would come to this because we always thought he was a good husband.'

Melo revealed the couple’s son is now staying with the maternal grandmother.

'After the funeral, he was asking me where's my mum. I told him she had became a star,' revealed the cousin.
