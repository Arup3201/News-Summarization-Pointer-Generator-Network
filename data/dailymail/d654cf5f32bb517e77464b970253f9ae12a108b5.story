Hopefuls from around the world are applying for a chance to win an all-expenses paid trip to an idyllic island in the South Pacific – but the journey will be anything but a holiday.

Self-made life coach Mark Bowness, a former school cleaner from the Wirral, is renting a slice of paradise to run a lifestyle boot camp aimed at changing the lives of six random strangers.

While most people would use the remote Fijian outcrop as their own personal playground, the 35-year-old is hosting the winners in a bid to help them launch their business, product or charity. 

Six lucky entrants will be flown to the 200-acre volcanic island of Vorovoro in Fiji for a two-week lifestyle 'boot camp'

Life coaches Sofia Toumbas, Ryan Magdziarz and Mark Bowness say they will help the winners launch their business, product or charity

To earn a spot on the island applicants must win over judges with an idea to make the world a better place, their personalities and compelling life stories.

More than 1,400 hopefuls from 22 countries, including 250 from the UK, have already applied for the opportunity at ThisIsYourLifeChange.com.

Six lucky entrants will win an all-expenses paid two-week stay – worth an estimated £130,000 – on the island of Vorovoro with life, business and fitness coaching and support for the idea over the next year.

Mark is splitting the £3,000 cost of renting the 200-acre volcanic island with his business coach, Ryan Magdziarz, and personal trainer, Sofia Toumbas, who are both from Australia.

Mark said the contest is open to people from all backgrounds: ‘You could be a teenage mum in New York, a corporate lawyer in London or an unemployed graduate in Melbourne.

‘You could literally be anyone, from anywhere in the world.

‘You will all have one thing in common – a deep down belief that the life you are living now is a life that is standing in the shadows of the one that you know that you were created to live, and an undeterred passion to make that change.

‘The end for me is to create some ground-breaking projects and turn them into reality. My goal is to inspire people. And obviously it raises our profile as coaches.’

Mark said the hopefuls have submitted amazing stories and one of the biggest challenges will be paring down the list to six.

One of the most memorable applications he has seen so far was from a ‘humanitarian clown’ from Australia who visits children's wards, hospitals and orphanages to inspire positivity.

Former teacher Ali Walsh, a 35-year-old coeliac, applied for the opportunity because she wants to expand her gluten-free cake business, Bristol Bakehouse, across the country.

She said: ‘As soon as I read about it, I knew I should apply - it's Fiji and it looks amazing. It would just be such a fantastic opportunity. I really want to make this work.

‘It's so lovely to be able to offer a child who can't eat gluten their first taste of a cake, or to be able to make a lovely wedding cake for a couple who are gluten-free.

‘I would plan to take everything they say and bring it back to Bristol and the country. It is a nervous wait now, but I would be so thrilled to get it.’

Mark attributes his drive to change lives to the breakdown of his marriage nine years ago, when ‘the walls came crashing down’.

After attempting suicide in 2006 he woke up in hospital with ‘a profound realisation of how precious life is’.

Just three months later he discovered Vorovoro and co-founded the eco-community Tribe Wanted.

He and co-founder Ben Keene invited a group of strangers to escape the rat race and build an eco-community on the island, which was filmed for a BBC documentary, Paradise or Bust, in 2008.

He said: ‘I am now giving six people an all-expenses paid opportunity to visit the same remote 200-acre island in Fiji.

‘They will be put through their paces by a life coach, a personal trainer and a business coach. Together we will ensure that their life will never be the same again.’
