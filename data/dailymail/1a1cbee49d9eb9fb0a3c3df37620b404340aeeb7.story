UKIP leader Nigel Farage is on course to take the Commons by storm by winning a seat in next year's General Election

Nigel Farage is on course to take the Commons by storm by winning a seat in next year’s General Election after his success in the televised clashes with Nick Clegg.

A poll for The Mail on Sunday in Folkestone, where the UKIP leader is considering standing as an MP in 2015, shows he could easily win.

Asked by pollsters Survation if they would vote for Mr Farage as their MP, 33 per cent of people in Folkestone said yes, just three per cent less than those who said they would vote for sitting Conservative MP Damian Collins.

If Mr Farage used his formidable campaigning skills to woo voters, he could defeat the low-profile Mr Collins, giving him a powerful Westminster platform to pursue his ambition of getting Britain to quit the EU.

Mr Farage received a further boost in a separate national poll by Survation that showed the TV debates have helped UKIP leapfrog the Tories in the race to win May’s European Parliament elections

Labour is ahead on 34 with UKIP on 27, the Conservatives on 21 and Lib Dems on nine. The UKIP score is up by four since a similar survey conducted the week before the Clegg-Farage TV debates, while the Tories have slumped by six.

Mr Farage threw down the gauntlet to Mr Cameron yesterday by challenging him to drop his refusal to take part in a TV debate with him.

The UKIP leader said his message to the Prime Minister was: ‘Your Coalition pal Nick tried and failed to beat me in debate, come and see if you do any better, Mr Cameron.’

Following hard on the heels of his TV triumph, the Folkestone survey is fresh evidence that Mr Farage is on the brink of a major breakthrough in British politics.

At present, his status as a Euro MP restricts him to the fringes of  mainstream politics. That would change dramatically if he sat on the benches of the Commons.

And the Survation poll shows Mr Farage’s dream of becoming an MP could become reality next year.

Asked if he planned to stand for Parliament, Mr Farage recently told the BBC’s Andrew Marr: ‘To be honest with you, I was thinking about Folkestone.’

The seat, in Mr Farage’s home county of Kent, was held by ex-Tory leader Michael Howard until 2005, when he was succeeded by Mr Collins who won a thumping 10,000 majority in 2010.

But that could disintegrate if Mr Farage stood against him. According to the Survation poll, Mr Collins’s share of the vote in 2010 would tumble  by 13 points to 36, with Mr Farage sending UKIP’s soaring from  five to 33.

Given Mr Farage’s populist reputation, once the campaign got under way it is likely that he would overtake little-known former advertising executive Mr Collins. 

Furthermore, a total of one in two Folkestone voters said they would consider voting for Mr Farage.

Last night a poll by ComRes found that Labour and UKIP are neck-and -neck in the race for the European elections.

Survation pollster Damian Lyons Lowe said: ‘Given UKIP now has the ability to campaign effectively in a seat where half the electorate said they would consider voting UKIP in a General Election, Folkestone should be added to the list of seats in which Farage could finally make his entry into the Commons.’

A total of 529 adults took part in the Survation online poll in Folkestone on Thursday and Friday.

A total of 1,001 adults took part in the Euro election national poll.
