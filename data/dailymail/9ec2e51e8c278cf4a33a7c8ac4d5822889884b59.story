Footage has revealed the sparse and yet contented life of Daniel Suelo - the man who has chosen to live without money for the past 12 years.

Suelo, now 51, renounced money in 2000, left his last $30 dollars in a phone booth and walked into the desert to start a new life in Moab, Utah.

His way of life has become an inspiration to thousands of Americans who have suffered in the economic crash and activists like the Occupy movement, disillusioned with a society consumed by avarice and greed.

A life less ordinary: Daniel Suelo sits in the Utah mountains where he has lived for more than a decade without using money

Mark Sundeen, author and friend of Daniel, has written a biography about his lifestyle after following him closely for several years.

Sundeen, whose book is entitled The Man Who Quit Money, freely admits that he had lost touch with Suelo for several years and when he heard that he was living without money, 'he thought he had gone crazy or had some kind of mental breakdown'.

However following the economic crash in 2008, Sundeen began to come round to Suelo's mindset.

Sundeen said: 'Here's someone who is saying I don't know what the solution is but I'm going to disobey.

He continued: 'Our financial system is so big we can't control it and in so many ways we feel enslaved by it. Worse, we feel powerless to change it.

'The fact is, if everyone lived like the
 average American, the world would actually collapse more quickly than 
if everyone lived like Suelo.'

On
 his blog Suelo describes his philosophy: 'I don't use or accept money 
or conscious barter - don't take food stamps or other government dole.

'My philosophy is to use only what is 
freely given or discarded and what is already present and already 
running (whether or not I existed).'

'Our whole society is designed so 
that you have to have money,' Suelo added.

'You have to be a part of the 
capitalist system. It's illegal to live outside of it.'

As well as quitting cash, he threw 
away his passport and driving license and changed his legal name, 
Shellabarger, to Suelo, Spanish for ‘soil’.

Ever since then Suelo has lived 
outdoors, camped in the wilderness, lived in caves, stayed in communes 
and spent nights in stranger’s homes.

For
 several years Suelo set up home in a cave, 200 feet across and 50 feet 
tall, on the edge of a cliff in the Arches National Park, Utah.

Here he 
carved a bed out of rock, foraged for food, drank from springs and 
bathed in a creek.

Any hikers were welcomed to stay with him to share his ‘home’, his books and the wildflowers and cactus seeds that he ate.

Born into an ultra-conservative fundamentalist family, Suelo took his faith extremely seriously growing up.

At
 college, however, he re-examined his beliefs and decided that money and
 the divide it creates between those who have it and those that don’t 
was both unchristian and wrong.

'He wants to have the smallest 
ecological footprint and the largest possible impact at improving the 
world,' his best friend, Damian Nash, told The Atlantic.

The fact is, if everyone lived like the
 average American, the world would actually collapse more quickly than 
if everyone lived like Suelo.

''His life goal since I met him is to take as little and give as much as possible.'

One serious lapse from penniless 
living came in 2001 when Suelo was living in a commune in Georgia and he
 received $500 tax return in the post.

Rather
 than tearing the cheque up he cashed it in and spent it on driving a 
brand-new convertible Mercedes-Benz 600 sports coupe across America.

But it was just a blip and Suelo continues to be one of the few people who live without money by choice.
