Police are investigating why a female BMW driver ploughed into a Vancouver diner, injuring four on-duty officers tucking into their dinner.

Maybe she thought it was a drive-through, or didn’t catch-on in time that, as a sign at the front clearly indicates, parking is actually at the rear.

The silver-coloured car, being driven by a 30-year-old woman, crashed into the Fatburger restaurant on Denman Street at around 8pm on Sunday evening.

The driver was heading south when she abruptly drove off the road, mounted the pavement and crashed into the front of the building.

Four uniformed officers eating inside were struck by the car and debris.

Police said that it’s early in the investigation, but alcohol does not appear to be a factor.

Officers with the VPD Collision Investigation Unit remain at the scene and will be trying to determine the cause of the collision.

The injured officers were taken to hospital but have now all been released with various injuries that, everything considered, are relatively minor, Vancouver Police said in a statement.

The driver was not injured, but was taken to hospital as a precaution. Her cell phone was seized for examination by officers that attended after the crash, but police say it is too early to determine if its use played a role in the collision.

No one else inside the restaurant was harmed.

Vancouver Police spokesman Constable Brian Montague told The Vancouver Sun: ‘It's something you don't expect, working your shift. You think the dangerous parts are over when you are sitting in a restaurant having dinner.

‘Unfortunately these things happen. We're hoping for a speedy recovery for our officers.’
