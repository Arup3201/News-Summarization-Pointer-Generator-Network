A Pennsylvania teenager is being hailed a hero after he pulled the fire alarm to alert other students that a knife-wielding 16-year-old was on a stabbing spree at Franklin Regional High School Wednesday morning. 

Nate Scimio is among 20 people - 19 students and a school security guard - who were injured in the frightening attack that began around 7:13 a.m. at the Murrysville school. 

Murrysville Police Chief Thomas Seefeld said Nate's courageous move to set off the campus fire alarm prevented more stabbings - and possibly saved lives.

'It was a good thing that was done,' Seefeld told a news conference Wednesday morning.

The brave teen, who is recovering at UPMC Children's Hospital, posted a picture of himself wearing a hospital gown later this morning, with the caption 'Chillin' at Children's.'

Not only did Nate alert other students to the emergency and encourage them to run away, he is also believed to have been injured when he stepped in front of other students to protect them.

From the photo it appears Nate suffered cuts to his right arm but he seemed to be in good condition.

Seefeld also applauded the bravery of assistant principal Sam King who he said wrestled the suspect - who CBS Pittsburgh later identified as Alex Hribal - to the ground. The teen was then handcuffed by a resource officer who had earlier called 911.

'There was a school principal who had contact with the juvenile and that led to his (arrest),' Seefeld said.

In a press conference, Dr Mark Rubino from Forbes Hospital credited another hero with potentially saving a life - a young girl who applied pressure to her friend who was seriously injured. Her name is not yet known.

Dr Rubino said: 'She displayed an amazing amount of composure to help that friend who was losing a lot of blood. She probably played a significant role in his ability to survive this.'

Kristen Beard told NBC News she talked to her injured friend about the spring dance to keep him conscious.

She said she spotted the suspect running down the halls with 'a knife in each hand' and then noticed her friend.

'and when I looked back, I saw [him] fall,' she told the network.

'He said, "Help, I'm hurt,"' Beard said.

She said she tried to pull him into a classroom to safety when a teacher came to the rescue. He had a wound to the lower back, she said, adding that she spoke to him about the prom.

Beard said another student in the room was throwing up and coming in and out of consciousness and had a very severe wound to the stomach.'

She said she was interviewed by the FBI so didn't go with her friend to the hospital. But she later learned he lost a kidney in the attack.

Five students remain in critical condition following the early morning attack.

The suspect was driven from Murrysville police station to a nearby hospital just before 10:30a.m. to be treated for cuts to his hands or wrists. It's not yet clear what the motive was for the stabbing or whether the suspect was targeting anyone in particular.

Nate was being lauded on Twitter by users following the stabbing that has shaken the community.

One tweeted: 'A hero emerges from a tragedy. Good thinking, Nate Scimio. Another wrote: 'Nate Scimio is just an amazing person.'
