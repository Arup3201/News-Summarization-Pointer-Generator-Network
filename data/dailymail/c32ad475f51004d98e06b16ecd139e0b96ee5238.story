'Never stopped trying': Capt Shepard

A Royal Marine has been awarded one of Britain’s highest bravery awards after making a desperate attempt to save his best friend during a diving exercise.

Captain Samuel Shephard is to receive the George Cross for his heroic efforts to recover fellow Marine, Lieutenant Damien Moran, 23, who suffered an embolism and sank 200ft to the seabed off Egypt in August last year. Capt Shephard repeatedly dived alone and without oxygen for 25 minutes in a bid to locate his comrade.

Hopes were raised when an instructor equipped with oxygen tanks arrived at the scene, but he ruled out a search on safety grounds. Capt Shephard ignored his warnings, strapped on the equipment and dived again.

As the medal citation reads: ‘At 1700 hours, in fading light and tired after six hours in the water, the pair [Capt Shephard and Lieut Moran] were snorkelling with four others… The other diver briefly surfaced with the others, lost consciousness, and sank rapidly.

‘A qualified and equipped diving instructor judged it too dark, deep and dangerous to mount a rescue. But without hesitation Shephard disregarded the instructor’s advice…

‘Following a series of dives that day, he knew the risk of decompression sickness, paralysis or even death was significant… Disorientated, in almost complete darkness, and with a perforated eardrum, he located the casualty suspended upside-down. His dive watch recorded a depth over 60 metres … Placing himself at even greater risk, he removed his mask to give the lifeless diver two rescue breaths.’

Capt Shephard carried his friend over a coral bank ‘in bloodied feet’ to get him to hospital, but Lieut Moran was pronounced dead on arrival.

The pair had just completed a four-month tour of Afghanistan before relocating to Egypt for diving training. Last night, Lieut Moran’s mother Gerta paid tribute to her son’s friend: ‘I am extremely grateful for what Sam did. He never stopped trying.’

The GC is the top bravery award for civilians, as well as military personnel whose actions would not normally be eligible to receive gallantry medals.
