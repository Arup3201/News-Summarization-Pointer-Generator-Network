A drag queen benefit cheat who was jailed for fraudulently claiming £88,000 while performing has returned to the stage to boast about the free publicity his crime had brought him.

Mark Hawthorn, 49, served three months of his six-month sentence for collecting unemployment benefit, after he said ill health kept him out of work between November 2003 and March 2012.

But just 48 hours after being released, he appeared in Birmingham as his high-heeled alter-ego 'Tilly', part of the duet act Glitterlips.

Video footage shows Hawthorn, from Coleshill Street, Tamworth, coming on stage to Banarama's Love In The First Degree - which has the words, 'Only you can set me free, cause I'm guilty'.

The eight minute video was uploaded to social network sites after the performance at The Village, in Hurst Street, Birmingham.

Appearing to an announcement that he had 'recently been released from prison', Hawthorn tells the crowd: 'This is really humbling. Just 48 hours ago I was surrounded by 1,000 big butch men.

'What makes me laugh most of all is that I managed to get my name in The Guardian. You couldn't buy this f****** advertising.'

Sentencing him at Stafford Crown Court in August, Judge Michael Challinor said Hawthorn was guilty of 'breathtaking' fraud.

He said: 'You should have confined your acting ability to female impersonation rather than defrauding the state.'

Prosecutors for the Department for Work 
and Pensions said an anonymous tip-off prompted its investigation into 
Hawthorn's 'systematic fraud'.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

In an eight minute video, which was uploaded to social network sites, Hawthorne, posing as Tilly, above, says he got out of prison less than 48 hours earlier. He then goes on to brag about how the trial gained him publicity

Trevor Meegan, for the DWP, said he failed to declare his status as 'a self-employed drag artiste' despite claiming to suffer a host of health problems, which meant he needed help 'both night and day'.

The judge heard Hawthorn was claiming 
disability living allowance, income support, council tax benefit and 
housing benefit, and had also failed to pay income tax or national 
insurance contributions from his on-stage earnings as 'Tilly'.

Hawthorn had admitted five counts relating to benefit fraud and non-payment to Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs.

Mr
Meegan said Hawthorn claimed the highest level of disability living 
allowance, stating he was 'only able to walk a short distance', suffered
from 'nausea, moodswings, and headaches' and needed to use inhalers 
'three or four times every two hours'.
