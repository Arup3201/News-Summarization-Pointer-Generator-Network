A father-of-two was stunned when he cracked open a massive egg, only to discover another smaller egg inside.

Sean Wilson captured the freak incident on camera after he decided to film the egg being cooked simply because it was so big.

Mr Wilson, 41, of Waterlooville in Hampshire, thought it would probably just contain several yolks but was flabbergasted when another perfectly-formed egg dropped into the pan after he cracked it open.

The Youtube video has had nearly half a million views since he posted it.

Sean Wilson was amazed to find a smaller egg within a gargantuan egg. He filmed the bizarre find and now the video has had nearly half a million views

Cracking: Sean thought his mammoth egg would just contain lots of yolks but was stunned when a whole egg fell into the pan

Mr Wilson said: 'We've kept chickens since 2009 when I bought two for my wife Marie for her birthday.

'You can imagine my surprise when I went to the coop on Tuesday to find two normal size eggs and one huge egg.

'At first I thought someone was playing a trick on me by putting a potato or something in there, but on closer inspection it proved to be a massive egg.'

The monster egg weighed a staggering 185 grammes and was just under 10 inches around and was laid by nine-month-old Rosie, who is an Amber Star chicken.

Ouch: Mr Wilson with Rosie, the chicken that squeezed out the huge egg

Mr Wilson, who runs a business that provides eco-friendly alternatives to skips, said Rosie was one of six chickens the family had, laying approximately 20 eggs a week.

Sean's daughters Star, five, and two-year-old Mimi do most of the collecting.

He said: 'They do slow down laying in the winter and hadn't been laying for a while due to the cold and our last decent collection was back in November.

'When Marie came home with Mimi we had a bet on how many yolks were in it, Marie said three and I thought four, but when I cracked it into the pan out came one normal runny egg and another whole complete egg - I was shell-shocked.'

The father-of-two can be heard in the video exclaiming: 'Oh. My. God. Shut up! You are having a laugh! There's an egg inside the egg, you've seen that for real, that's no joke.'

Viewers of the video have been quick to defend the video's authenticity with some offering explanations to this unusual occurrence.

One viewer said: 'This happens when chickens get stressed and they don't lay for 2-3 days - It's not fake, it's just super rare.'

Brave Sean wasn't put off by the franken-egg and still managed to enjoy his fried egg sandwich.

He said: 'Apart from it being a little bit misshapen it was a perfectly-formed egg and was very tasty in my fried egg sandwich.'

The enormous egg placed next to a regular egg for scale. He initially thought someone was playing a joke on him

Unexpected eggs-tra: Sean ate both eggs and proclaimed them 'very tasty'. An egg in an egg is rare but not unheard of
