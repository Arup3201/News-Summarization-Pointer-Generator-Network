A shocking new report has found one in eight U.S. women admit to binge drinking with that rate increasing to one in four among high school girls.

With the figures, binge drinking was found contributing to the deaths of about 12,000 women and girls annually, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said with their report released on Tuesday.

They say it's a long-overlooked problem, with the women found drinking an average of six drinks per session, despite it causing a long list of health risks, including breast cancer and heart disease.

'Binge drinking is an under-recognized women's health issue,' Frieden said in a conference call on the new report. 'Women tend to be smaller and therefore are more susceptible to the harms of alcohol at lower levels of drinking.'

Binge drinking for females is defined as four or more drinks in a single session. For men it's at least five.

About twice as many men than women binge drink, but the health risks are different for women and the dangers of their behavior draw less attention, CDC Director Thomas Frieden told reporters.

Binge drinking can increase a woman's risk of breast cancer, heart disease, unintentional pregnancy, sexually transmitted diseases and auto accidents, he said.

CDC scientists reviewed data collected on the drinking behaviors of approximately 278,000 women aged 18 and older, as well as 7,500 high school girls in 2011.

The report estimated that nearly 14 million U.S. women binge drink about three times a month, consuming an average of six drinks during each binge. Half of all high school girls who consume alcohol reported binge drinking, the CDC said.

The excessive use of alcohol is most common among white and Hispanic women, those aged 18-34, high school girls and women with household incomes of more than $75,000, the CDC said.

Underage women and those who are pregnant should not drink at all, the CDC said. Other women are advised not to have more than one alcoholic drink per day.
