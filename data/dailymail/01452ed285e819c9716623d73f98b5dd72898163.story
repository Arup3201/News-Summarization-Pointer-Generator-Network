Cancer patients are being forced to wait too long for urgent treatment because the NHS is under ‘huge strain’, warn campaigners.

Official figures show that waiting-time targets have been missed for the first time since they were introduced five years ago.

The targets state that patients with cancer must not wait longer than two months from when their GP refers them urgently to a specialist to the start of their treatment.

'Huge strain' on the NHS means that cancer patients are having to wait too long for urgent treatments, campaigners have warned

For the first time since 2009 the overall target of 85 per cent of patients starting treatment within the 62 days has not been met.

Department of Health figures show that in some hospitals only six in ten patients were seen within 62 days in the period from January to March. Sixty of approximately 180 hospital trusts in England failed to hit the 85 per cent target in the final quarter of 2013/14.

The average slipped to 84.4 per cent during the period January to March, down from 85.8 per cent during the previous quarter.

Figures were worse for patients with lung cancer, urological cancers and gastrointestinal cancers than for those with breast cancer or skin cancer.

Mike Hobday, director of policy and research at the charity Macmillan Cancer Support, said: ‘It is of great concern that the number of trusts missing this target has doubled over the last year. Around one in four of the trusts that were hitting the target at the start of 2013/14 are now missing the target.

‘This is the first breach of any cancer waiting time in England since 2009 and is a clear warning sign that the NHS is under huge strain.

‘The UK already has some of the worst cancer survival rates in Europe. More patients are now facing delays, which means more patients are facing anxiety for longer and more lives are being put at risk. We’re very worried that the co-ordination of cancer care is getting worse and that cancer is being overlooked in the new NHS.

‘The number of cancer patients is set to increase from two to three million by 2020. We can’t afford to see more and more people waiting longer.’

Sean Duffy, national clinical director for Cancer for NHS England, said work must be done to make sure standards are met.

‘Latest figures show nationally the NHS has met and exceeded seven out of eight cancer waiting time standards,’ he said. ‘But there is variation in meeting the challenging standards, and national performance against one of the targets has dipped. Commissioners are working with local providers where the standard is not being met to identify the issues to ensure patients are treated in a timely way.’

The Department of Health said: ‘The NHS is treating more cancer patients than ever. Since 2009, we’ve seen the number rise by 15 per cent.

‘We want the NHS to have the very best cancer services in the world, and are investing £750 million to support early diagnosis and access to treatment.’
