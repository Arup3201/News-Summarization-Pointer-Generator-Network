A terrorist attack in the UK linked to Islamic extremism is 'almost inevitable' in coming months, security chiefs have warned.

Ministers are reportedly being briefed daily by security officials who have warned of a 'step change' in the threat posed by terrorism since the rise of the so-called Islamic State insurgency.

Scotland Yard and MI5 believe they have foiled three plots in London in the past few months, two of which were said to have been urgent interventions to stop terrorists ready to strike.

Sniffing for trouble: Security was tight this year amid dire warnings of possible impending terror attacks

An unnamed source told The Times the killing of Fusilier Lee Rigby last year had taught extremists 'they only need a kitchen knife and a mobile phone to carry out a high-impact attack.'

The warnings come after tight security at Remembrance Sunday, with the Queen appearing at the Cenotaph in Whitehall after it was locked down by dozens of visible armed police.

A judge yesterday extended the detention of four suspects arrested in connection with an Islamist terror plot just two days earlier.

Counter-terror police seized the men, aged 19 to 27, on Thursday night at locations across west London and High Wycombe in the Thames Valley area, Scotland Yard said.

It is understood the men were plotting an attack on British soil. The timing of the arrests raised fears that Remembrance Sunday events in London were alleged targets, but sources told The Times the Queen was not a target.

Tensions have been raised by a slew of terror arrests amid fears British intervention against the Islamic State insurgency in Iraq could motivate a string of new radicals in the UK.

Last month a 21-year-old man, a 32-year-old man and a 25-year-old woman were arrested by anti-terror police in three separate probes all linked to Syria.

Officers searched two properties in Bedfordshire, two in west London and one in Hackney, north east London after raids over the last three weeks.

Four terror suspects were also charged with plotting to kill policemen and soldiers in London drive-by shootings earlier last month.

Tarik Hassane, 21, Suhaib Majeed, 20, Nyall Hamlett, 24, and Momen Motasim, 21, all from London, appeared at Westminster Magistrates Court amid tight security as they were charged with an Islamic State-inspired gun plot.

It was alleged to have been formulated following a fatwa by a senior ISIS terrorist.

Despite the chilling warnings and spreading climate of fear, the head of the UK's armed forces has urged Britons not to let terror fears 'stop the British way of life'.

General Sir Nicholas Houghton said Britain must not 'succumb to any sense that there is a terrorist threat' and should carry on as normal.

Speaking ahead of the Remembrance Sunday events, the Chief of the Defence staff told BBC One's Andrew Marr Show: 'I think the mood is definitely different this year but the biggest thing that makes the mood different, I think, is the intensity and the poignancy about it born of the aggregation of the 100 years commemoration of the First World War, the 70 years of D-Day, I think the end of combat operations in Afghanistan.

'But, certainly the proximity of the sense of threat for this weekend, which has intensified the nature of the security that's attendant on it, has sort of contributed to quite a different feel about this year.'

Earlier this month, senior police officers and MPs said there was likely to be a significant rise in the number of armed police at the Remembrance Sunday and Armistice Day commemorations in London due to increased fears of a terror attack.

The arrests come a few months after the national terror threat level in the UK was raised from substantial to severe, meaning a terrorist attack is 'highly likely'.

This assessment is separate from the evaluation concerning police officers.

The Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre (JTAC) raised the level against a backdrop of increasing concerns over hundreds of aspiring British jihadis travelling to Iraq and Syria to learn terrorist 'tradecraft' and fight alongside terror groups such as Islamic State (IS).

Although there is currently no link to Syria or IS, fears were raised when IS fighters encouraged supporters in Western countries to 'rise up' and commit acts of terror in their home countries.
