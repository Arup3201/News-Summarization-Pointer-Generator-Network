A paralysed man accused of killing his wife and mother-in-law made legal history yesterday when he went on trial for murder from a hospital bed.

Sergei Zolotovsky, 44, was left paralysed when he twice attempted suicide after he allegedly stabbed his estranged wife Svetlana Zolotovska, 40 – and her mother Antonina Belska, 70 – to death when she was awarded the family home after a bitter divorce.

Yesterday he became the first person to be brought to court in a hospital bed after being wheeled in on a trolly and positioned in front of the dock.

Legal history: This court drawing shows suspected double murderer Sergei 
Zolotovsky in his hospital bed beside the jury box at the Old Bailey 
today. He denied charges of brutally murdering his estranged wife and 
mother-in-law

Zolotovsky, 44, a plumber, is alleged to have stabbed Svetlana at a bus stop in Beckton before going back to the family home and killing Ms Belska.

Ms Belska’s body was discovered by firefighters called to the semi-detached house when neighbours spotted flames.

Zolotovsky is said to have been found by police in the loft at the house, having apparently tried to cut his own throat.

He underwent emergency surgery and recovered but then suffered further injuries which led to him becoming bedridden.

Judge Stephen Kramer told the jury of six men and six women about the ‘unusual circumstances’ of the case before the trial got underway.

He said: ‘As you can see, and as you were told when you were empanelled, the defendant is unusually in a bed and not in the dock.

‘Prosecution counsel will shortly open the case to you - in other words, she will tell you what the Crown say this case is about.

‘When she opens the case to you, you will hear that Mr Zolotovsky tried to commit suicide before he was arrested by police.

‘He cut his wrists. He made a second attempt to kill himself when he was in custody. As a result he sustained extensive injuries, including extensive paralysis.

‘That is why he is in a bed. He is unable to sit in the dock in the normal way. That is by way of an explanation to the unusual circumstances pertaining to this court.’

The ambulance bringing Zolotovsky to the Old Bailey today: It is believed to be the first time a suspect has faced charges there from his hospital bed

Zolotovsky, of Edmonton Green, has pleaded not guilty to two charges of murder.

He lay propped up in the bed today, fully clothed and wearing black with a white shirt, his arms folded across his chest.

Asked to confirm his name by the court clerk, he replied: 'Yes.'

Svetlana Zolotovsky worked as a pharmacy technician in the private Wellington Hospital in  St John’s Wood.

Preparations for the historic case began when cleaners were brought in last week to make the 50-year-old courtroom as hygienic as possible.

Court 16 was chosen as the biggest and most accessible courtroom in the more modern half of the Old Bailey building.

The trial of three men accused of shooting five-year-old Thusha Kamaleswaran, who was left paralysed as the innocent victim of alleged gang warfare in Stockwell in March last year, was moved next door to accommodate the Zolotovsky case.

The ambulance bringing Zolotovsky to court arrived at the judge’s entrance in Warwick Square, which is located away from the public entrance to the courts complex.

The case continues.
