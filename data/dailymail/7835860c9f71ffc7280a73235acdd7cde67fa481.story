Only 8.1 per cent of Britons admitted to being unable to afford food in 2012, down from 9.8 per cent in 2007

The number of families  saying they are going hungry has fallen over the past five years – as the number of food banks has risen.

Britons were among the least likely in the developed world to say there were times when they could not afford food, an international report found.

Only 8.1 per cent reported this in 2012, down from 9.8 per cent in 2007 – before the economic crisis and when Labour was in power.

The study by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, which represents industrialised nations, flies in the face of Left-wing claims that cuts in public spending are leaving thousands of families going hungry.

The number of food banks has increased over the past few years, with charities claiming that more than half a million people across the country have visited them.

It emerged this month that more than a third of councils are subsidising food banks at a cost of £3million to the taxpayer.

While most town halls paid for support such as management and administration, some were even paying for the food.

The Government has repeatedly questioned whether food banks are responding to growing need.

Last week Welfare Minister Lord Freud said it is very hard to know why people go to food banks. While he conceded nobody turned to charities for food parcels ‘willingly’, he suggested more people were visiting the banks simply because there were more in existence.

Last night a Whitehall source said: ‘Shameful opportunism has led some people to leap on this issue as a way to bash the Government.

‘It’s a relief to get some clear-sighted figures. It’s time to reframe this debate with a little more honesty.’

Figures on the proportion of people going hungry are published in  the Social Indicators 2014 report by the OECD, after surveys were carried out by pollsters Gallup in all 34 member countries.

The UK total of 8.1 per cent is far less than the EU average of 11.5 per cent, an increase from 9.5 per cent before the economic crisis, and the OECD average of 13.2 per cent, which rose from 11.2 per cent.

In fact, the UK came 24th out of 34 – far behind our near neighbour France on 10 per cent.

Countries hit by the eurozone crisis fared badly, with Ireland on 9 per cent, Spain on 12 per cent, Italy on 13 per cent and Greece on 17 per cent. The highest need in Europe was in Hungary, where 31 per cent went hungry.

Canada, New Zealand and the United States – which came sixth on 22 per cent – all ranked far worse than Britain.

Only ten countries are lower in the table than the UK, including Germany, Japan and the Nordic and Benelux countries. Bottom of the table was Switzerland on 4 per cent.

Most countries have seen their level of need rise since the financial crisis – but not Britain. We are one of only 11 countries to see the proportion fall since the last survey in 2007, along with Switzerland, Japan, Germany, Sweden and Poland.

The report said: ‘Responses confirm that rising numbers of families may have less money to spend on food and a healthy diet.’
