A Baltimore-bound JetBlue flight out of Boston was diverted to Philadelphia on Sunday evening after smoke was reported in the cabin.

The airline says Flight 827, an Embraer 190 jet, landed just before 6 p.m. and 95 passengers and four crewmembers were safely evacuated. No injuries were reported.

A JetBlue statement says the captain elected to divert out of 'an abundance of caution' after the crew reported smoke while en route to Baltimore Washington International Airport.

Emergency landing: The Jet Blue Embraer was forced to land at Philadelphia en route from Boston to Baltimore

Evacuation: Passengers had to evacuate the plane upon landing in Philadelphia

Disruptive: Passengers were left stranded in a nearby field whilst waiting for the airport bus to collect them

Glad to be on the ground: Passengers console one another after many were left shaken

Escape: Passengers escape the Embraer 190 at Philadelphia International Airport which was nearing the end of its flight to Baltimore

Passengers were no doubt a bit shaken, but everyone escaped unharmed.

One passenger says she smelled the smoke and found it hard not to think the worst in mid-air.

'You don't know how it's going to end, so you don't want to psyche yourself out â€“ should I turn on my phone and call my parents?' passenger Laura-Chase McGehee told Fox 29.

JetBlue says the passengers were put on a later flight.
