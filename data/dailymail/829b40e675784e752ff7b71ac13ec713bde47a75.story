The mother of the Boston Marathon bombing suspects is set to travel to the U.S. today with her ex-husband, nearly a week after one of their reign of terror came to an end.

Zubeidat Tsarnaeva, who now lives in Dagestan, Russia, said in an emotional telephone interview that she believes her sons, Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, have been framed for the bombings.

The suspects' father, Anzor Tsarnaev, has already been interviewed by Russian and American authorities there - and will also travel to the U.S. to be interviewed by investigators.

Speaking out on Wednesday, Mrs Tsarnaeva launched into a bizarre rant in 
which she claims she does not care if she or her youngest son are killed
 by U.S. authorities.

Rant: Zubeirat Tsarnaena, the Boston bombers' mother, has said she does not care if her surviving son is killed

Their eldest son, Tamerlan, 26, died 
after a shootout with police in Watertown, Massachusetts on Friday, 
while her youngest, Dzhokhar, 19, is in hospital recovering from a bullet wound
 to the neck.

'If they are going to kill him, I don't 
care,' she told CNN of Dzhokhar.
 'My oldest one is killed, so I don't care. I don't care is my 
youngest one is going to be killed today. I want the world to hear this.
 And I don't care if I am going to get killed too. And I will say 
Allahu akbar!'

While Dzhokhar was reportedly injured from a self-inflicted gun shot wound as he sought to hide from police in a boat parked in a backyard, his mother said she does not believe this account.

'You know what I think? I think now they 
will try to make my Dzhokhar guilty because they took away his voice, 
his ability to talk to the world... They did not want the truth to come 
out,' she said.

She added that the only reason her sons were targeted was because they were Muslim, adding that she saw footage of Tamerlan being killed 'really cruelly.'

U.S. authorities are on their way to speak with Zubeidat Tsarnaeva in the aftermath of the bombings.

Suspects: Dzhokhar, right, and Tamerlan Tsarnaev are accused of planting the Boston bombs at the historic race on April 15

Investigators traveled to southern Russia on Tuesday to speak to Mrs Tsarnaeva and her husband Anzor, an American Embassy official said.

But if she returns to the U.S. to see 
her son - as she reportedly intends to as early as Thursday - she could 
be arrested, thanks to an outstanding shoplifting charge.

Busted: Mrs Tsarnaeva, 45, was arrested last year after she allegedly stole $1,600 worth of clothing from a Massachusetts Lord & Taylor store

ABC News reported on Tuesday that Mrs Tsarnaeva failed to show up at a court hearing stemming from a July 2012 arrest.

So if she returns to the U.S. to visit her hospitalized son or make burial arrangements for the other, she 
could be arrested on an outstanding warrant.

Mrs Tsarnaeva, 45, allegedly stole $1,600 worth of clothes from a Massachusetts Lord & Taylor store.

She was charged with two 
counts of malicious/wanton damage and defacement to property after 
allegedly swiping the merchandise from the retailer's Natick, 
Massachusetts location in June 2012.

She was due in court on October 25 for a hearing in the case, but never showed up.

The Lord & Taylor location is 
not the same as the one on Boyleston Street in Boston, where a 
surveillance camera captured what police say is her younger son 
dropping a pressure cooker bomb that was hidden inside a backpack.

The family's lawyer Heda Saratova, asked for the family to be left alone and said that the parents had just seen 
pictures of the body of their elder son and were not up to 
speaking with anyone.

Questioning: Zubeidat Tsarnaeva, mother of Boston bombing suspects Tamerlan and Dzhokhar, leaves her home for the first time on Tuesday in Dagestan with an unidentified man

Grief: Zubeidat Tsarnaeva is pictured outside her home in Dagestan, a predominantly Muslim province in Russia's Caucasus

'The mother is in very bad shape,' Saratova said. 'She watches the video and cries.'

The images, taken by a resident of Watertown, Massachusetts and posted on his blog, appear to show the Tsarnaev 
brothers sheltering behind a vehicle and taking aim at police 
officers.

They are reportedly seen running to a car for more supplies before
 hauling out a pressure cooker bomb they then detonated, filling the 
street with smoke.

The photographs, taken on the 
eyewitness' phone from a third-floor bedroom overlooking the 
scene, are the first images giving insight into the fraught battle that 
left one brother dead.

Dzhokhar Tsarnaev then jumped in the car 
and barreled towards the police barricade, making a narrow escape. Authorities said that he ran over his brother Tamerlan.

Dad: U.S. investigators traveled to southern Russia on Tuesday to speak to Mrs Tsarnaeva and the brothers' father Anzor, pictured, an American Embassy official said

Their mother told Channel 4 on Tuesday that her sons had nothing to do with the terrorist attacks.

She said: 'What happened is a terrible thing but I know my kids have nothing to do with this. I know it, I am mother.'

She added to CNN that she had spoken 
to Tamerlan after the bombings and he told her he missed her and loved 
her, and she said her 'loving' son even inquired about the cat.

The trip by the U.S. team was made 
possible because of Russian government cooperation with the FBI 
investigation into the bombing at the Boston Marathon.

Also on Tuesday, the bombers' sister, 
Ailena and Bella Tsarnaev, released a statement to the media, saying 
that they 'don't have the answers' about their brothers' alleged crimes.

Threat: In another image, a red circle shows what the eyewitness believed to be a pressure cooker bomb

Taken down: Tamerlan Tsarnaev was killed in a gunfight with police on April 19. Dzhokhar, who was injured, was captured that eveningÂ 

The statement read: 'Our heart goes 
out the victims of last week's bombing. It saddens us to see so many 
innocent people hurt after such a callous act.

'As a family, we are absolutely devastated by the sense of loss and sorrow this has caused.

'We
 don't have any answers but we look forward to a thorough investigation 
and hope to learn more. We ask the media to respect our privacy during 
this difficult time.'

The mother is from Dagestan, while the suspects' father is from neighboring Chechnya.

Their
 sons had spent little time in either place before the family moved to 
the U.S. a decade ago, but the elder son was in Russia for six months 
last year.

Shielded: Katherine Russell, the widow of Boston Marathon bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev, leaves her lawyer's office on Tuesday

The father of the two Boston bombing suspects will apparently travel to the U.S. later this week in order to seek 'justice and the truth'.

Anzor Tsarnaev says he has 'lots of questions for the police' and is keen 'to clear up many things' when he arrives from his home in Makhachkala in Russia.
