Lisa Flynt, daughter of Hustler Publisher Larry Flynt (pictured above in April 2013), is in critical condition after a Friday car accident. 

The daughter of controversial Hustler Publisher Larry Flynt is currently in critical condition after a car crash Friday evening.

Lisa Kay Flynt, 47, left a local bar with 24-year-old friend Cierra Mallory before 5pm when she  swerved in front of a semitrailer and rolled her Oldsmobile on Valley Pike in Riverside, Ohio. 

The Huber Heights resident was ejected from the vehicle in the crash, and rushed to Miami Valley Hospital in Dayton, Riverside Police said

On Saturday, police executed a search at the bar where Flynt and Mallory had just left before the crash. 

Malley was taken to the hospital after the accident as well where she was released after receiving treatment. 

Ms Flynt is one of 71-year-old Flynt's five children.

Her younger brother Larry Flynt Jr, 41, drove to Dayton from his home in Columbus on Saturday to visit her in the hospital. 

He told WPXI that doctors are trying to determine the extent of cranial injuries.

Larry Flynt Sr, 71, is the publisher of Hustler and the chairman of a large adult entertainment empire. 

However, he is best known for being part of the landmark Supreme Court Case Hustler Magazine v. Falwell.

Flynt's magazine was sued by Evangelist Jerry Falwell after they published an ad which joked about the first time Falwell had sex. 

Falwell tried suing the magazine, but the Supreme Court ruled that since he was a famous person, he couldn't receive damages for emotional distress - strengthening the First Amendment right to free speech.

The story about the infamous legal battle was turned into a movie called The People vs. Larry Flynt, starring Woody Harrelson as the pornographer.
