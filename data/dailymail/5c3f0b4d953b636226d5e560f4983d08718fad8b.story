Google isn’t the only firm looking to create phones that can be upgraded, rather than replaced.

The Puzzlephone lets owners swap parts in and out of the handset either when they break, or when a better version of that particular module is released.

The Finnish firm behind the plans is currently testing prototypes of the device, and hopes to release the handsets by the second half of 2015.

The Puzzlephone (pictured) from Finnish-based Circular Devices lets owners swap parts in and out of the handset either when they break, or when a better version of that particular module is released

Circular Devices began working on the project in 2013.

Each Puzzlephone is based around three elements - the Spine, Heart and Brain.

The phone’s LCD display, microphone, main buttons and speakers connect to the Spine.

Its Heart contains the battery and so-called secondary electronics, while the Brain is where the camera and processor is kept, alongside the main circuitry of the device.

Each of these three segments can be slid out of the core, and replaced with another.

According to the developer kit, Ara phones will be able run on multiple batteries - when one battery dies, it can be detached and replaced with a full battery module.

Each phone 
will have a central 'spine' and an endoskeleton - nicknamed 'endo' - 
made of ribs that the individual modules will clip on to.

There will be three different sized 
endos - including mini, medium and large - to rival the existing range of 
phones currently on the market, from compacts to phablets. 

Larger phones will be able to accomodate either larger, or additional modules, than the mini will.

Google's kit describes various modules including batteries, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chips, cameras, speakers and more.

In theory, any sensor that can be fitted to a module will be able to attach to a module and while Google will make the shell, these modules will be made by other companies. 

By printing their own parts, users will also be able to customise them.

Circular Devices recently commissioned Rauno Huttunen and his team at Versoteq to create the prototype, which was printed using a 3D printer.

‘As we are facing ever greater challenges of increasing consumption and decreasing resources,’Circular Devices explained, 'we need new solutions. We need mobile standards that enable resource efficiency as well as platforms for hardware innovation.

'When one part of the phone needs repair or upgrade there is no need to replace the entire device.

'Puzzlephone was established to create that change - to create a mobile industry that is both ecologically and socially sustainable.'

Mr Huttunen added: 'We liked the openness of Puzzlephone, and the modularity of it and we can use it to demonstrate the capabilities of 3D printing.'

In addition to switching out the hardware modules, Puzzlephone’s operating system will also be customisable.

In the future, the firm said it will release Puzzlephone standards to developers and manufacturers so they can use the concepts in their own devices.

Circular Devices plans to release the first Puzzlephone during the second half of 2015. It is currently seeking funding for the device, and is testing the prototype.

In October, Google unveiled the first working prototype of its own modular phone called Spiral 1.

In a video, an engineer is shown turning on the device, unlocking it and launching an app during a video filmed at NK Labs in Boston.

Individual modules are shown being added to, and removed, from the handset including the LED module, battery, processor, speaker, and a USB port.

Puzzlephone is similar to the modular phone being built by Google's Project Ara. Dubbed Spiral 1, the device (pictured) is demonstrated during a video filmed at NK Labs in Boston.

'The first step is figuring out how is this is going to work,' explained the creative agency. 

'What are going to be the functions of the different parts of the system? And then from there, we select specific components and draw schematics.'

'Once you have a layout, you get the boards fabricated.

'It’s magical when you open up the box and say "oh my goodness, that’s the thing we’ve spent all these months designing.'

The firm said that when the power is applied for the first time to the modules, it's what is known as the Smoke Test.

'Your primary thought at that point is, is this thing going to start smoking?' continued the engineer. 

In the video, an engineer is also shown turning on the device (pictured), unlocking it and launching an app. According to the developer kit files released in April, Ara phones will be able run on multiple batteries - when one battery dies, it can be detached and replaced with a full battery module

'Is it going to overheat? Is there some critical error or not? And then, once we have the individual pieces working we put them into the complete system.'

In the video, a board is shown fitted with connectors. The designers then demonstrate sliding the components in and out.

In the Spiral 1 prototype, 50 per cent of the phone is taken up by the modules, but Toshiba has made custom chips for Spiral 2, which the company said will increase the amount of space on the device.

Spiral 2 will be demonstrated at a developer’s conference on 14 January.

Lower-resolution cameras can be swapped with higher-res versions, and users will be also be able to 3D print replacement parts.

By printing their own parts, users will also be able to customise them.

The files also revealed each phone will have a central 'spine' and an endoskeleton - nicknamed 'endo' - made of ribs that the individual modules will clip on to.

This spine is shown in the Phonebloks video at NK Labs.  

There will be three different sized endos - including mini, medium and large - to rival the existing range of phones currently on the market, from compacts to phablets.

Larger Ara phones will be able to accomodate more modules than the mini will, for example.

Google's kit describes various modules including batteries, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chips, cameras, speakers and more.

In theory, any sensor that can be fitted to a module will be able to attach to an Ara device, and while Google will make the shell, these modules will be made by other companies.
