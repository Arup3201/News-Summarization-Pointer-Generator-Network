As Eilidh Child roared over the finish line at Hampden on Thursday night, the capture of a second Commonwealth silver medal was not the only hurdle she had successfully cleared.

As she raced off on her lap of honour, the Games’ poster-girl from Perth could also delight in having fulfilled the expectations of a nation with a taste for glory following eight days of unprecedented success. Delight in the knowledge that her run had delivered Scotland’s record return on the track for a generation.

But, perhaps more importantly, the 27-year-old could tick off another box on her wedding plan. Child is set to tie the knot with her fiance Brian Doyle in October next year, but the couple had put preparations for their nuptials on hold during training for Glasgow.

One idea they had mooted was to name the tables at the wedding reception after athletics stadiums. Now, after confirming her seat at the Commonwealth Games’ top table, Child is ready to make Hampden the centrepiece of her ceremony.

‘We’re getting married in October next year. The only thing that we can confirm now is that we are going to do different stadiums as the table names,’ the athlete beamed. ‘Glasgow was going to be one of them, but if the race didn’t go the way I wanted, I didn’t want to be reminded of it! Now Glasgow can be the head table!’

It was a night which is already being commemorated in the streets of Glasgow. Many are embracing Scotland’s triumphs by donning traffic cones beneath the Wellington statue — the duke’s own hat gleaming with gold once more.

Hundreds lined the streets of the Merchant City yesterday afternoon as their silver star showed off her prize atop the Irn Bru store — one little girl was overheard begging her mother: 'Will Eilidh be there?'

One place she won’t be is back on the track tonight. The former-PE teacher elected to sit out yesterday’s 4x400metres relay heats, but her younger team-mates’ fourth-place finish wasn’t enough to give Child one last Hampden hurrah.

‘It’s quite a young, new team,’ she said, ahead of the race. ‘They asked me if I wanted to run the heat but I took a step back, and said it would be really nice for the four girls who have not raced at the championships yet to go out and run.

‘Lynsey Sharp and I are the other members of the team, so we’ve already been out there and seen that crowd. It’s great for all Scottish athletes to appreciate that crowd.’

Although the relay girls will not be appearing on the podium, Child is tipping the rest of Team Scotland’s athletes to add to their best medal haul on the track since their five in Auckland in 1990.

‘It’s brilliant, because we’ve only won two medals at each of five Commonwealths,’ she said. ‘It’s great that we’ve got that monkey off our backs and gone one extra.

‘Hopefully it doesn’t stop with me, hopefully there’s more medals to come in the next couple of days as well. The whole of Team Scotland has upped its game and it just shows you what you can do when there’s a home games with that whole support behind you’

After the whirlwind of Glasgow, what next? One thing’s for sure, the Face of the Games is unlikely to experience the same level of expectation she felt here when she competes on the world stage.

‘It’s really good for me because I’m probably not going to race on a bigger stage,’ Child explained.

‘I know the Commonwealths are not valued the same as the Olympics, but for me, a home Games is about the most pressure I’m going to have on me at a championships.

‘I’m just happy that I dealt with it in the right way. It means that when I go to Rio, when I go to the World Championships, I’ll be in a better position that what I’ve been in before. I am confident that I will be able to conduct myself well like I’ve done here.

‘I’ve got about a week until the European Championships, where I am ranked No1. Hopefully, I can try and get another medal there, but it really depends on how I recover from this.

‘I’ve never really done back-to-back championships before, but hopefully I can come back and do something there as well.’

Having drunk deep in the euphoria of Glasgow 2014, some might expect Child to use the momentum to target an elusive Olympic medal in two year’s time. Having finally shed weeks and months of pressure, she isn’t in a hurry to pile to it all back on.

‘I don’t like to set myself targets because it limits you,’ Child smiled. ‘I think I will just see what happens.’
