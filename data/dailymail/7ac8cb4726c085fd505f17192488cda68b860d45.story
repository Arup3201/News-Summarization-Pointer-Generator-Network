There was no escaping the soggy weather for fashionistas in London on Saturday morning as designer Orla Keily added umbrellas and a rainy day soundtrack to her show.

Irish designer Kiely, one of the Duchess of Cambridge's go-to labels for smart daytime dressing, was one of the first shows of the second day of the fashion extravaganza.

Instead of a standard catwalk she created a retro set at the Central Saint Martins building where models wrapped up in teddy bear coats, pastel-coloured wool and pretty swing dresses.

The Irish designer's signature style is 'colour, pattern and texture with a Sixties twist'

Kiely describes her signature style as 
'colour, pattern and texture with a 60s twist.'

Here
 white tights, chunky shoes and oversized Peter Pan collars gave the 
looks that sweet Sixties edge that Alexa Chung channels so well, while knee-length hems, safe cuts and lots of sleeves will no doubt keep the Duchess coming back for more.

Chunky shoes, thick tights and oversized Peter Pan collars injected a retro vibe into a very wearable, if not very glamorous, collection

Meanwhile, designer Emilia Wickstead seemed to be doing everything she can to move away from that pretty pink dress that Duchess Kate once chose to wear for a Buckingham Palace tea party.

Her smouldering AW14 collection took influence from film noir with edgy looking models stomping down the catwalk in leather dresses, snakeskin coats and embellished socks. So far so NOT Kate.

Waists were nipped and skirts were flared managing to be incredibly sexy despite a serious absence of flesh: a calf here, a flash of midriff there.

Pops of colour came in fuchsia gowns and rainbow-coloured lace and most looks were finished with spiked, metallic Manolo Blahnik heels, slicked hair and a scowl from the models.

The standout piece for most of the attending fashion press was a fuchsia gown which has already enjoyed a red carpet moment as model Suki Waterhouse wore a pastel version of the dress to a BAFTA party.

Suki didn't make an appearance on Saturday's front row, but London Fashion Week regulars Laura Bailey, Olivia Palermo and Poppy Delevingne were there to up the glamour factor, with Bailey choosing a bright striped dress from Wickstead's spring/summer collection dressed down with a casualparka, in her signature English eccentric style.

Max Factor's lead make-up artist, Mel Arter, created, what she described as, a raw nude look for the Emilia Wickstead show today.

For the base, she prepped with the brand's newly launching primer, which coated the skin with a Velcro effect and added longevity.

She then neutralised and corrected the skin with each of the brand's five new CC sticks, which were hand-picked by the legendary Pat McGrath and are due to launch in April.

'These sticks neutralise any imperfections, so if you're quite sallow, we've got the purple to bring skin back to life and the green stick, which helps with redness, and we have a highlighter stick too,' explained Mel.

She then applied a warm nude highlighter to the cheekbones with her fingertips and completed the look with the new Lipfinity shade, Always Delicate, a lovely warm nude that really brings the lips to life.

'We don't want it to be too glamorous, the clothes do the talking so we wanted the look to be quite a contrast,' she said.

 There was a difference backstage this season, Mel was wearing the brand new Google Glass, which captured exactly what she saw as she created the beauty look.

Mel said: 'Being backstage is an exciting time for a make-up artist. It’s a prime opportunity to get really creative and use the latest products for the first time. 

'By using Google Glass this season, you’ll be able to see exactly how I’m creating the look; a make-up artist view on camera that has not been seen before.

'Women can then follow this process and create all or parts of the look themselves at home.

'I think we are going to be seeing them a lot more in the world of make-up artistry. I am chuffed to be pioneering it.'

Now THAT's cool! Mel Arter (bottom right) used Google Glass this season, so fans are able to see exactly how she created the look; a make-up artist view on camera that has not been seen before
