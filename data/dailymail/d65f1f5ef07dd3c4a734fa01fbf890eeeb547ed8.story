The child at the centre of the Toddlers & Tiaras 'Go Go Juice' scandal is to appear in her own TLC reality series.

Alana, six, whose mother was accused of 'doping' her with caffeinated drinks and high sugar snacks after appearing on an episode in January, is to star in Here Comes Honey Boo Boo.

The six-part series, due to premiere in August, will follow the youngster and her 'coupon queen' mother, June, as they go about their lives in rural McIntyre, Georgia.

According to the network, it will see the family 'doing what [they] do best: four-wheeling through mud pits and picking up road kill for the family cookout.'

The show will also introduce her chalk-miner father, Sugar Bear, and three sisters: Lauryn, aka 'Pumpkin', 
12, Jessica, or 'Chubbs', 15, and pregnant 17-year-old Anna, known to the family as 'Chickadee'.

A press release reads that the show 'takes us off the pageant stage and into the unapologetically outrageous family life of the Honey Boo Boo clan.'

Alana and her mother were at the centre of a storm of controversy after their appearance on Toddlers & Tiaras at the start of this year.

The episode saw June tell how 
she created her 'Go-Go Juice' mixture of Mountain Dew and Red Bull after 15 bags of Pixy Stix  - tubes of powdered sugar often known as 'pageant 
crack' - failed 
to boost her daughter's energy.

Insiders speculate that some mothers' 'special juice' blends may even contain alcohol.

June was filmed instructing Alana to take 'two big gulps' from an 
unlabelled bottle. Within seconds the change was apparent and the 
pageant hopeful was seen rapidly swinging her arms over her head and 
spinning around on the floor, exclaiming: 'My go-go juice is kicking in 
right now!'

Describing how 
the drink made her feel, she said: 'Go-go juice makes me laughy, and 
play-ey, and makes me feel like I want to pull my mommy's hair.'

It seems Alana is already a spirited child though. She has a bizarre speaking manner that is at once precocious and incoherent.

She tells cameras that she wants to win pageants to make money because 'a dollar makes me holler, honey boo boo!'

But she is not entirely enthusiastic about the experience. She continues: 'Beauty is so boring, I don't want to do it.'

June's enthusiasm is more than evident though. As her daughter takes
 to the stage, she is filmed yelling encouragement, and instructing 
dance moves.

When she is not
 accompanying her daughter on the pageant circuit, June says she spends 
her time collecting money-saving coupons and stockpiling hundreds of 
household products - a pursuit her daughter claims she wants to follow.

items ranging from toilet paper to rolls of aluminium foil.
