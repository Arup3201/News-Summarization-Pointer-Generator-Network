The scandal of MPs enjoying extravagant expenses might seem like an indictment of the modern politician.

But the identity of the very first commoners sent to Parliament can be revealed by a new book only because they too pocketed public money for their time and travel more than 700 years ago.

And the desperate scrabble of today's politicians to submit claims is also centuries old, with Parliament inundated with hundreds of complaints for not paying out enough.

This is one of the earliest parliamentary expense claims, dating from 1309, and paid out to Fulk Peyferer, who also attended the first Parliament in 1258

King Henry III ordered that four knights from every county, and six from Yorkshire, attend the first Parliament

In the mid-13th century, Henry III was forced to accept a new form of government and agreed under the so-called Provisions of Oxford to convene a king’s council to deal with affairs of the realm and ‘legitimate local grievances’.

He ordered that knights from different parts of the country would report back to a Parliament on problems they had come across.

In all 150 knights were appointed, four from each county and six from Yorkshire. Some were too ill to travel, others were deemed ‘not fit’ and replaced.

But records unearthed by Labour MP Chris Bryant show that at least 14 did attend the very first ‘parliament’ in London in 1258 – and they all claimed expenses.

In an eerie echo of the 2009 scandal that rocked Parliament, the expenses offered were over generous to make sure the MPs turned up.

Knights were offered 4 shillings-a-day, including for their travel from every corner of the country - twice the rate for going to war.

According to Chris Bryant's research, at least 14 names were record on the very first expense claim for attending Parliament in October 1258.

They were:

According to Mr Bryant’s new book, Parliament: The Biography, the names on the claims include Fulk Peyferer, Mauger le Vavasour and William de Iseny.

The details were revealed in the ‘partially illegible gall-spattered Close Rolls of November 1258 show that the “reasonable expenses of coming and returning” to the Michaelmas council were met for the knights from at least ten counties’.

Mr Bryant said: ‘I started this book because I wanted to know who the very first commoners were who came to Parliament – people whose names we have and know they actually attended.

‘I found a list in the National Archives, it’s all on velum, from October 1258.

‘That has 14 names of people coming from Kent, Yorkshire and so on. The only reason we know they came is because they had their expenses paid.’

Britain’s oldest expenses form was also unearthed, dating from 1309, which included claims by Bartholomew de Badlesmere, and Fulk Peyferer, who appears to have claimed for several decades.

'The King was so keen to have impressive and important knights to come to Parliament that whereas he would pay two shillings to go to war, he paid four shillings for coming to Parliament each day, including every day they were travelling. That was quite a hefty amount in those days.

‘From 1377 to 1505 there were 119 disputed  cases, mainly where people weren’t pay what they should have been paid.’

The successor body, the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority, is still bombarded with complaints from MPs today about their claims.

They can still claim for rail, road and air travel, including being reimbursed for cycling on official duties.

But since the 2009 scandal they are no longer able to claim for mortgages, extravagant shopping sprees on furniture or eating out when Parliament is sitting.

Labour MP Chris Bryant unearthed the very first expense claims while researching his book Parliament: A Biography

By CHRIS BRYANT

A highly significant provision of the Oxford settlement was that the king’s council would deal not only with affairs ‘of the realm and of the king’, but also with legitimate local grievances.

To this end the Oxford council resolved that knights (rather than magnates or clerics) be appointed to investigate problems in each county and report back to ‘parliament’ later in the year.

So, on 4 August 1258, Henry wrote to the sheriffs of the thirty-seven counties of England, sending to each a list of local knights from which a number were to be chosen ‘to enquire touching excesses, trespasses and injuries committed in that county, and to bring their inquisition personally to Westminster by the octave of Michaelmas, for delivery to the council’.

In all bar one county four knights were nominated, but for Yorkshire there were six, giving a neat total of 150.

Not all those originally summoned were to make it to Westminster. Peter de Montfort (no relation to Simon), who had presided over the Oxford meeting, sent word that three of the Shropshire knights were ‘not fit’; so they were replaced.

And when the sheriff of Devon pointed out that two of his were sick he was allowed to appoint substitutes.

We can, however, be certain that some of them did attend the parliament, for the partially illegible gall-spattered Close Rolls of November 1258 show that the ‘reasonable expenses of coming and returning’ to the Michaelmas council were met for the knights from at least ten counties.

In the cases of Lincoln and York the knights who attended are named – and are the same as those summoned in August.

A further seven counties’ knights seem to have arrived later, as their expenses were also met, and again in the case of Huntingdon the names of the attendant knights are the same as those summoned.
