Roberto Martinez has no regrets about failing to sign Tom Cleverley as he insisted Everton’s squad will cope with the demands of four competitions.

Everton’s manager tried until late on transfer deadline day to negotiate a deal with Manchester United for Cleverley but, in the end, a deal could not be reached and the England international subsequently joined Aston Villa on loan.

Martinez had previously experienced a hectic summer window, bringing in five new faces, but he is not concerned that he failed to add Cleverley, as he believes they have the depth to cope with playing in the Europa League and the Barclays Premier League.

‘You always get opportunities on the last day of the window,’ said Martinez, whose side return to action on Saturday against West Brom. ‘I would never be disrespectful of someone not on our books. I thought he could have brought something different but it didn’t work out.

‘I was very pleased that we had the majority of our business done before the final day. We had a couple of opportunities but the final few options, in the end, weren’t quite right for us.

‘We are really happy with numbers and the quality that we have. We have the youth and experience to be competitive with a game every three days. This is quite new for us, coping with a lot of games and a lot of travelling. We want to embrace it and really enjoy it. We will find out a lot about ourselves.’

Everton are still seeking their first win of the fledgling campaign and Martinez, while satisfied with the levels his side have shown in games against Leicester, Arsenal and Chelsea, knows they need to improve defensively.

‘We have been a little bit slack in our defensive duties and we have conceded too many easy goals,’ said Martinez. ‘There may have been a lack of defensive intensity and that is something we will address. But I do see a team that has improved from last season.

‘The performance in the first 45 minutes against Arsenal was as good as it gets. All in all, I am really excited about the potential I have seen. We had 15 clean sheets last season. There is no need for drastic revolution. It is all about small details. We can’t wait to get back to the standards that we have.’

Martinez has injury doubts over Leon Osman (calf) and Samuel Eto’o (groin) for the trips to The Hawthorns. Of the pair, Eto’o is least likely to travel but Martinez expects he will be fit for the Europa League opening game against Wolfsburg.

Ross Barkley, meanwhile, is 'making good progress' as he continues his rehabilitation from a medial ligament injury but Everton’s manager believes it will be another four weeks before the England midfielder is ready to return.
