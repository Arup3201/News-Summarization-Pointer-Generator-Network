An NFL football player with a history of social media faux-pas appears to have posted a picture on Twitter that shows a small pile of marijuana sitting on a coffee table.

Davone Bess, a wide receiver for the Cleveland Browns, posted the photo Thursday morning. In addition to the supposed marijuana, there is also a cigar and what appears to be an alcoholic beverage of some kind.

Dope: This is the photo Davone Brown posted on Twitter Thursday before quickly deleting it

Trouble: Bess could face disciplinary action from the NFL and the Cleveland Browns for posting the photo to a social media website

Accompanying the photo, the 28-year-old Bess wrote the caption 'we da real dons!'

Marijuana is on the NFL's list of banned substances, so Bess could potentially face consequences with his employer.

In December, Bess again made headlines for sharing a photo on Instagram that appears to show him smoking marijuana.Â 

The date of that photo is unknown, but Bess promptly erased his entire Instagram account.

'Dons': In addition to the photo, Bess included the caption 'We da real dons!"

The Twitter photo Bess posted Thursday also has been erased from Bess' account.

Last week, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said that he was open to the idea of removing marijuana from league's list of banned substances for players living in states where the drug is illegal.

Additionally, 7-time Pro Bowler Lomas Brown last week said that he suspects roughly 50 percent of all active NFL players currently use marijuana even though it's on the league's list of banned substances.

The vast majority, however, aren't dopey enough to post pictures of the drug on their social media accounts.

According to the Cleveland Plain Dealer, the Cleveland Browns organization already is looking into the photo.
