A recently published study has found that police equipped with body cameras reduced their use of force by around 50 percent and complaints by the public against them dropped by almost 90 percent.

The startling figures were revealed as part of a research study conducted by the University of Cambridge and was based on a 12-month trial conducted among 1,000 officers in Rialto, California.

The dramatic results have led to a clamor across the country from police chiefs keen to equip their officers with cameras, especially in light of increased community tensions toward perceived police brutality, caused by the deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Garner.

The year-long study which began in 2012 had its findings published in the Journal of Quantitative Criminology in November and answered the hotly debated topic of whether cameras could reduce police force and, crucially, the number of complaints filed by the public.

'This is a promising tool for police officcers, which is likely to be a game changer not only for the professionalization of policing, but in terms of police-public relations,' said Dr. Barak Ariel, the lead author of the study and a lecturer in Experimental Criminology at the University of Cambridge in England.

Speaking to Newsweek magazine, Dr. Ariel pointed to the fact that his findings and body cameras could be a salve for frayed police relations with the public.

The LAPD now plans to equip 7,000 of its officers with body cameras and the NYPD and Chicago police forces are planning similar trials.

Indeed with the shooting by Ferguson Officer Darren Wilson of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown and the chokehold death of Eric Garner in New York City, protests sparked against police brutality across the country.

The anger in these two cases was exacerbated by the failure of a grand jury to indict the officers involved, despite Garner's police incident being recorded on cellphone.

Then, on November 22, a police officer in Cleveland, Ohio, shot 12-year-old Tamir Rice after the boy was caught waving a BB gun around a public park.

Many law enforcement officials support cameras' use and say they are effective. The police department in Rialto, California, found after a yearlong University of Cambridge study last year that the cameras led to an 89 percent drop in complaints against officers and an almost 50 percent drop in police force

Pointing to the trust-building effects of the cameras, the study wrote, 'The use of force by police, particularly if excessive, has a lasting effect on public perceptions of police and police community relations......and can potentially tarnish their relationship with the community.'

The study by the University of Cambridge's Institute of Criminology began in February 2012 with the Rialto, California police department.

They serve 100,000 people and 1,000 police were assigned body cameras randomly, while others did not wear them as a control for the study.

Each camera weighs around a quarter of a pound and carries batteries that last up to 12 hours.

Once the shift was over, the camera's video was reviewed and the researchers concluded that officers not wearing the cameras used force roughly less than 50 percent than if they were not.

The study's authors believe this is because they were aware of beig filmed.

'With institutionalized body-worn-camera use, an officer is obliged to issue a warning from the start that an encounter is being filmed, impacting the psyche of all involved by conveying a straightforward, pragmatic message: we are all being watched, videotaped and expected to follow the rules,' said Dr. Ariel to Newsweek.

'Police subcultures of illegitimate force responses are likely to be affected by the cameras, because misconduct cannot go undetected — an external set of behavioural norms is being applied and enforced through the cameras,' he says. 'Police-public encounters become more transparent and the curtain of silence that protects misconduct can more easily be unveiled, which makes misconduct less likely.'

While the researchers could not be sure whether the cameras affected the behavior of both police and the public, the reduction in use of force and complaints was stark.

Police body cameras have become a rallying cry in the wake of racially charged decisions by grand juries in Ferguson, Missouri, and New York City, but experts caution that increased use of the devices may raise more questions than answers.

Often what is filmed may appear excessive to a person unfamiliar with police work, even though the conduct may be legal.

'There's this saying in policing: 'It's lawful, but awful.' It's technically legal to do that, but it's a terrible thing to do ... We have to work on the awful piece, that's what we need to focus on,' said Jim Bueermann, who heads the nonprofit Police Foundation.

Officers in one of every six departments around the country now patrol with tiny cameras on their chests, lapels or sunglasses. And President Barack Obama wants to spend $74 million to equip another 50,000 with them around the country.

A camera captured a white New York police officer applying a chokehold that led to the death of Eric Garner, an unarmed black man. In Ferguson, Missouri, there was no camera showing what happened when a white police officer fatally shot Michael Brown, a black man.

In both cases, grand juries declined to indict the officers.

Many law enforcement officials support cameras' use and say they are effective.

The police department in Rialto, California, found after a yearlong University of Cambridge study last year that the cameras led to an 89 percent drop in complaints against officers, possibly reining in misbehavior on the part of the public and officers as well as ultimately limiting department liability.

'If it were up to me, every officer walking around in a uniform would be wearing a body camera,' said Martin J. Mayer, a California-based attorney who has defended law enforcement agencies for more than 40 years.

Most civil libertarians support their expansion despite concerns about the development of policies governing their use and their impact on privacy. Rank-and-file officers worry about being constantly under watch, or that an errant comment may be used by a supervisor to derail their careers.

Officers, however, generally have the law on their side.

A 1989 U.S. Supreme Court case concluded that claims an officer used excessive force must be judged by whether the officer's actions were ' 'objectively reasonable' in light of the facts and circumstances confronting them' at the time.

With video evidence, 'we're being forced to confront exactly what these legal standards mean,' said Peter Bibring, a staff attorney for the ACLU of Southern California. 'It provides the public a much better foundation to draw their own conclusions about what police are actually doing, and whether they believe it's appropriate.'

Mayer said that in most states the penal code allows officers to use 'the amount of force necessary to repel and overcome' force used by an individual. 'It's not just to match. It's to overcome it,' he said.

Camera footage provides an independent record from the officer's perspective and tangible evidence that cannot be changed, unlike often malleable and faulty eyewitness accounts, experts say. But video is limited, only showing what's in front of it after the camera is turned on.

That allows for interpretation and ambiguity that can inflame the public, regardless of what the law allows.

'At the end of the day, if people don't like the lack of an indictment, then they have to look at what the legal standard is in these cases. Sometimes that's the law,' Bueermann said.
