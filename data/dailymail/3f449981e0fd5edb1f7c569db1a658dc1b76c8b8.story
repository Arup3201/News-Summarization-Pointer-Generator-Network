Fear: Experts fear over-50s, driven on by fiction such as Fifty Shades of Grey, might find themselves picking up sexually transmitted infections when they embark on new partnerships

A deluge of mummy porn has inspired women of all ages to seek more adventurous relationships.

But while many in their 30s and 40s are well versed on the risks of sex, the older generation are said to be woefully ignorant.

A wave of ‘silver separations’ has led to a boom in older people playing the dating game – many of them fitter and more active than counterparts from past decades.

Experts fear this group, driven on by fiction such as Fifty Shades of Grey, might find themselves  picking up sexually transmitted infections when they embark on new partnerships.

The FPA, formerly the Family Planning Association, said older people are dating with little idea about how things have changed.

Acting chief executive Audrey Simpson said: ‘Early in their relationship older couples should be talking about going for a sexually transmitted infection test… they need to be aware they are equally at risk as young people.’

She told The Times that older people who have been through divorce ‘are 
entering the dating scene with little idea about how things have 
changed.

‘They are likely to know even less about sexual health than young people, who have been the target of services and campaigns,' she said.

Analysts believe longer life spans mean older people - many of whom grew
up during the sexual revolution of the 1960s and 70s - have greater 
interest in sex and a higher likelihood of changing partners at 
increasingly higher ages.

Latest figures show that divorce and cohabitation are on the increase among older people.

In 2001 there were 3,693 women aged 60 or over who were divorced, a number well below pension-age divorce in the early 1980s.

But last year the level had risen by 58 per cent to a record 5,836.

Among men over 60, divorce numbers went up by 43 per cent from 6,580 to 8,539. Numbers of husbands over 60 divorcing are higher because men typically marry at older ages than women.

Older people are shown to be increasingly likely to fall victim to divorce alongside some other risky age groups.

The greatest number of divorces came among husbands and wives aged between 40 and 44 - broadly those who are between seven and a dozen years into their marriage. The risk has long been picked out by the phrase ‘seven year itch’.

The FPA warning came as the group, together with sexual health organisation Brook, published a report which said that 2.3 million women are facing restrictions on the availability of contraception.

It warned that limits on contraceptive availability could cost taxpayers £110billion (sub: billion correct) by 2020 in extra costs on the NHS for abortion, maternity and child health, and for education and state benefits for children produced by unwanted pregnancies.

In 2011 there were 8,000 people aged between 35 and 44 known to have the STI chlamydia - up 9 per cent in five years, but fewer than 4,000 45 to 64-year-olds, though this is up 13per cent since 2008.

Fewer than 2,000 people between 45 and 64 had gonorrhoea, though that is up 41 per cent in five years, and only just over 600 had syphilis, about the same as 2008.

Numbers of over-65s known to have STIs are negligible.
