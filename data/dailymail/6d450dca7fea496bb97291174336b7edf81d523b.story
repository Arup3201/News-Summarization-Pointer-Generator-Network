Michael Schumacher's wife Corinna has written a personal note thanking Formula One fans for their support following the seven-time world champion's skiing accident.

The family's life was turned upside down when Schumacher, 45, fell in the Alps in December, putting him in a coma for six months.

He was finally released from hospital in Grenoble in June, but is still a long way from a full recovery.

Writing in the German Grand Prix programme, Corinna said: 'This is a message to all of you who have passionately followed Michael's sporting career, and who have supported him in the past (seven months) off the track as well.

'The German Grand Prix gives me the perfect opportunity to thank you all for the good wishes and positive energy you keep sending to Michael.

'I have to say your sympathies blew us all away. It is good to know that together we made it through the hardest time.

'Now we are facing a phase which will presumably take a long time. We trust that time will be Michael's ally in this fight. Until then I would like to wish you and your families all the best as well.'
