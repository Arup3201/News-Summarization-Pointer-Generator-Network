A rally car, travelling at 135mph, collided with a kangaroo which jumped onto the track during a race. 

Video footage captured on a dash cam by driver Anthony Gilbertson shows the car racing down the track during an event in New South Wales in Australia to reach 135mph (213kmph), before it collides with a kangaroo and flips over multiple times 

The screen goes black as the car rolls over and over after the high speed crash with the kangaroo, damaging the front of the vehicle.

 Gilbertson can then be heard to shout: 'We just hit a kangaroo - f****** big time.'  

The crash took place at the Bathurst 12 Hour endurance race for GT and production cars held at the Mount Panorama Circuit on Sunday.

After a precautionary visit to the hospital, Gilbertson managed to escape without any injuries.

Writing online after the event, a member of Gilbertson's crew explained that the driver was not badly injured. 

It said: 'The car has sustained too much damage to continue today. Anthony was taken to hospital for four hours as a precaution but is back at the track now.

'A lot of hard work and money went into this year's effort and as you can imagine it is hard to take when you are taken out by the wildlife!'

The condition of the kangaroo is unknown.

The dashcam recorded the car as Gilbert began to drive at speed down the New South Wales race track 

As Gilbert exceeds 130mph (213kmph)  a kangaroo (circled) appears on the track right in the path of the car

The race car reaches 135mph (220kmph) and hits the kangaroo with force and begins to flip over and over 

The front of the car is considerably damaged after the crash with the kangaroo and finally comes to a stop
