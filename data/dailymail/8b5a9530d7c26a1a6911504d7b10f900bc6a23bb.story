Prince Harry is being lined up as  commander of the Household Cavalry and could be in post by 2023

Prince Harry is being tipped for a role as a 'future commander of the Household Cavalry', it has been reported.

The royal, a serving captain in the Blues and Royals, is said to have passed all the necessary exams to be promoted to major and could advance to Lieutenant Colonel by 2023.

He reportedly told friends he would be 'honoured' to take up the role in charge of the oldest and most senior regiment in the British Army.

Captain Harry Wales, as he is known in the military, confided in colleagues that 'every serving officer wants to command their own regiment and I am no different,' according to the Daily Star.

The 30-year-old prince was commissioned into the Blues and Royals, one of two regiments which make up the Household Cavalry, in 2006 and later trained as an Apache gunner and pilot.

He is currently serving in a staff officer role at the Horse Guards Parade in London, a post he took up last year, although he is reportedly expected to rejoin his regiment next year.

A senior officer told the paper: 'I am absolutely delighted Harry has set his sights high. Every officer at Harry's stage in his career should be thinking of his future and should be ambitious enough to want to command his regiment. 

'There's nothing wrong with that. He is a very capable officer and has proved his worth in battle.'

The prince has undertaken two operational tours of Afghanistan - in 2008 as a forward air controller and again in 2012 as an Apache pilot based at Camp Bastion in Helmand province.

He was promoted to his current rank of captain in April 2011 and in July 2013 he qualified as an Apache aircraft commander.

A promotion to commander of the Household Cavalry would make him the first serving royal general in history, while serving as a member of the Army.

Made up of the Blues and Royals and the Life Guards, the regiments are split between two units, which operate different roles - and Harry could be put in charge of either.

The Household Cavalry Regiment (HCR) has an operational role in armoured fighting vehicles and along with the five Foot Guards Regiments, form the Household Division, based at Windsor Castle.

The second unit is the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment (HCMR), based at Knightsbridge, equipped with horses.

Their role is to carry out ceremonial duties on state and royal occasions, including The Queen's Birthday Parade in June each year and the State Opening of Parliament.
