A disabled woman who is a virtual prisoner in her own home has posted a hard-hitting video highlighting her plight to the housing chiefs who failed to adequately house her.

Tracey Bennett, 37, has suffered from Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) since a work-related accident six years ago left her with difficulty walking.

In the video posted on YouTube, titled 'Westminster Council’s Shame', the former youth worker demonstrates how she moves around her flat by pulling herself along with her arms and sliding on her legs across the floor.

She said she rarely eats hot food as she is unable to cook in her kitchen because the work units are too high, and she cannot use her wheelchair on the second floor, council-owned property in Paddington, West London, as it is too wide to fit through doorways.

She eats food from a bowl on the floor next to the mattress where she sleeps and is reliant on the kindness of friends or family members, who bring her basic necessities.

Ms Bennett is calling on the council to rehouse her in ground-floor accommodation and said she made the video because she is at her 'wit’s end'.

The council said that since 2008 Ms Bennett had been on a list allowing her to bid for a housing transfer when new properties became available.

A spokeswoman said they were working closely with her to try and improve her situation, adding that her care package had been doubled after it became clear last week that her condition had worsened owing to an arm injury.

Recounting one period when she said she was left housebound while a new lift was fitted, Ms Bennett said: 'I’ve never committed any crime but I was kept prisoner here.

'I know there are people worse off than me, but I have been trying for three years to get rehoused and I haven’t got anywhere.'

There is a chronic shortage of council housing in Westminster, many homes having been hived off under the right-to-buy scheme.

Councillor Rachael Robathan, Westminster Council’s cabinet member for adults and health, said: 'We have made every effort to tackle this situation since Ms Bennett first made us aware of her injury.

'The council agreed to double Ms Bennett’s care package with additional help following a visit from a care manager.

'Ms Bennett first applied to our housing options service in 2008 and is able to bid on properties that become available.

She says she has no choice but to sleep on the floor and relies on friends to bring her food because she can't leave her house to shop

'The position is that she has yet to place a bid.

'This is a very difficult case and we want to make sure that we do everything we can to help Ms Bennett.

'I am pleased that the care team responded immediately when they were notified of her injury and I hope that the extra measures we have put in place in response to this will help her.

'We will continue to work closely with her to make sure that the services she is offered reflect her current needs following her accident.

'Our housing options team will be carrying out a further medical assessment based on the new information we now have.'
