Outdoor warmth: Despite the unpredictable British climate, one in ten households have a heated hot tub in their garden (file picture)

At one time the only accessories you needed for a back garden were a few tools, a lawnmower and a shed to store them in.

But nowadays more and more Britons are digging up their flower beds to make way for luxury hot tubs and outdoor spas.

Despite the unpredictable British climate, one in ten households have a heated hot tub in their garden - and the British and Irish Spa and Hot Tub Association says sales actually increase in years of cold weather.

The craze for outdoor bathing is highlighted in a survey of 2,000 homeowners carried out by OnePoll for Lloyds TSB Insurance, which found that 10 per cent of respondents now owns a hot tub.

The report found that people are furnishing their outdoor spaces with increasingly expensive equipment - and the average UK garden is now worth £1,928.

Some 57 per cent of householders said they use the garden as a place to relax, rather than to cultivate plants.

Other luxury purchases include summer houses, outdoor dining areas and children's play areas.

Meanwhile sales of outdoor plants are declining, with the Garden Centre Association Barometer of Trade recording a 15 per drop between January and June 2012.

Hot tubs have been in the UK since the 1970s, the craze for outdoor bathing having made its way to Britain from Scandinavia via America, but sales have taken off in the last decade.

Paula Tanner, 47, a nurse who lives with her husband in Brighton, converted part of her garden into a leisure area with a spa after her children left home two years ago.

'Time-poor homeowners': Frances Tophill, presenter of ITV's Love Your Garden, said she hopes 'the traditional image of the flower-filled Great British garden is not beginning to wilt'

'I'm always outside,' she said. 'The hot
tub is always a talking point when friends come round and is great for 
parties!' Not everyone, however, is thrilled at the new penchant for an 
outdoor soak.

Neighbours' hot tubs and noisy late-night spa parties were listed among the top 10 most common causes of 'garden rage' by BBC Gardeners' World magazine last year.

The magazine cited complaints about 'students acting like three-year-olds' and 'groups of middle-aged women shrieking'.

The OnePoll survey found that 20 per cent of respondents in the West Midlands owned a hot tub, compared to 12 per cent in London, 7 per cent in the North East, 4 per cent in Scotland and 2 per cent in Northern Ireland.

Prices range from around £3,000 for a basic hot tub, to over £17,500 for a 14-foot model, with running costs starting at £1 a day.

Frances Tophill, presenter of ITV's Love Your Garden, said: 'We don't often get a chance to peek over the garden fence of the nation.

'But as homeowners become too time-poor for gardening, features like decking, summer houses and leisure items have moved into prime position in our back gardens.

'Whilst it is positive that we are valuing our outdoor spaces more, I hope the traditional image of the flower-filled Great British garden is not beginning to wilt.'
