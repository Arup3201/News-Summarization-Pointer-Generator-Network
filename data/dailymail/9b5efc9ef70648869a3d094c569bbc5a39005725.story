The Palm Springs home which Elvis and Priscilla Presley used as a May 1967 honeymoon getaway is now on the market for $9.5 million.

The 4-bedroom, 5-bathroom home includes nearly 5,000 square feet and is listed by Million Dollar Listing star Josh Altman and his brother Matthew Altman.

Featured in 'Elvis & Me' and 'Elvis by the Presleys,' the home is built in 'four perfect circles, on three levels,' according to its listing page. The home also includes a pool, tennis court and even a stage.

'The King' rented the home for approximately a year starting in 1966 and paid $21,000, according to the Wall Street Journal.

Mr Presley and Priscilla spent their 
honeymoon in Palm Springs shortly after their Las Vegas wedding. 
Daughter Lisa Marie was born nine months later.

The home is currently owned by M.L. Lewis, a Boston investor, according to the Journal. Though Lewis does not live at the residence, he reportedly had it decorated to include both period furnishings and photos of the Presleys.

Guides dressed as Elvis and Priscilla even offer guided tours for fans, the paper adds. A 'Weekend with the King' is also held every May at the residence, and this year fans can expect a tribute concert.

'It's literally a time capsule of Elvis,' Josh Altman told the Journal. 'When I walked into the house, I was all shook up.'
