San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick launched an extraordinary Twitter rant at a fan who questioned his work ethic yesterday.

The talented footballer had taken to the social media site to brag about his extreme exercise workout - while also fitting two hours of studying into the day.

But when a fan responded to the tweet by mocking the athlete's performance on the field, Kaepernick reacted angrily, writing: 'You got 8 followers... Get better at life!'

Angry tweets: San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick launched an extraordinary Twitter rant at a fan who questioned his work ethic yesterday

Final message to fan: The talented footballer sent a series of impassioned tweets to the supporter, the last of which ended with 'get better at life' 

Kaepernick, 27, was once criticized by former 49ers head coach Jim Harbaugh  for getting too involved in Twitter and social media disputes.

The latest row began after the star footballer wrote: '1000 abs.... arm workout..... 10 min straight on the jump rope.... 2 hour study session in February..... that's what we call a recovery day!' 

A fan named Stephen Batten soon responded by saying: '@Kaepernick7 @49ers ab workout won't help find open receiver #study.' 

In two sharp replies, Kaepernick referred to the fan as a 'clown' and asked him if he was 'illiterate or just ignorant' before requesting he give him a 'breakdown of every defensive coverage'

Working hard: General Manager of the San Francisco 49ers, Trent Baalke, recently praised Kaepernick's work ethic, saying: 'He's a very dedicated player. I'm sure he feels good about the progress he's made'

Only 11 minutes later he sent the critical fan a third message, writing: '@battman_returns you got 8 followers bruh your own family don't even want to know what you doin! Get better at life!'

The supporter now has more than 100 followers.

General Manager of the San Francisco 49ers, Trent Baalke, recently praised Kaepernick's work ethic speaking in a press conference reported on the team's website.  

 

Full exchange: The dispute started after Kaepernick posted a message about his workout routine - to which fan Stephen Batten responded by mocking the NFL player's performance on the field

He said: 'Colin is working his tail off. I think everybody saw the reports that he's down in Arizona working hard with Kurt and several other people.'

'He knows what he needs to work on. He's a very dedicated player. I'm sure he feels good about the progress he's made up to this point.

'The only reason you go down there and do the things he's doing is to get better. That's the mindset. I think he feels comfortable right now with where he's at and hopefully that transfers to the field.'
