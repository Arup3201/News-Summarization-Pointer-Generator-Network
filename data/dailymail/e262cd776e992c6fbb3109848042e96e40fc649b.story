A British man has been stabbed to death on the Caribbean island of Barbados, it has been claimed.

The victim, who has not yet been named, was reportedly stabbed in the chest early yesterday morning following an altercation with a local man in St Lawrence Gap, Christ Church - a neighbourhood popular with tourists.

The man, understood to be a telecommunications worker, was taken to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in nearby Bridgetown, where he later died from his injuries.

St Lawrence Gap is a one mile stretch of coastal road in the centre of the parish of Christ Church in south west Barbados.

Commonly referred to as 'The Gap', the neighbourhood is dominated by the tourist industry, with lively bars, restaurants and nightclubs open until the early hours of the morning.

The area is roughly three miles from Bridgetown - the capital of Barbados and the location of LIME's office on the island.

The company, which dominates the landline, broadband and mobile phone industries throughout the Caribbean, is owned by UK-based Cable & Wireless Communications.
