GPs have called for all school nurses to be able to give the morning-after pill to teenage girls.

NHS trusts in some areas have already introduced the scheme in an attempt to reduce the number of unwanted teenage pregnancies.

But now GPs including Dr Anne Connolly, chairman of the UK-wide Primary Care Women’s Health Forum, have called for the scheme to be introduced nationwide.

Dr Connolly said: ‘It’s a great idea. Giving out emergency contraception should not be done in isolation, but as part of a wider programme.’

The call comes after doctors in Scotland expressed a similar view.

Current Scottish policy requires school nurses to direct pupils seeking contraception to reproductive health or sexual health clinics.

But family campaigners fear that giving young girls easier access to the morning-after pill will only lead to increased promiscuity.

Conservative MP Philip Davies thinks that if teenagers are given the contraceptive pill that their parents must be told

Norman Wells, director of the Family Education Trust, said: ‘Schemes like this are giving girls as young as 13 a licence to engage in illegal sexual activity and denying them the protection of the law that the age of consent is intended to give.

'Health workers who provide under-age girls with contraception without the knowledge of their parents are seriously undermining the role of those parents.’

Tory MP Philip Davies said if teenagers were given morning-after pills or contraceptive injections by school nurses, their parents should be told.

School nurses can currently issue the morning-after pill to girls in some schools in Bristol, Northumbria, Peterborough, Oxfordshire, County Durham, West Midlands and Berkshire.
