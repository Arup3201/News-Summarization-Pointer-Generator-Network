Former Housemartins and Beautiful South frontman Paul Heaton has resigned as a patron of Sheffield United's Community Foundation over the club's decision to allow convicted rapist Ched Evans back to training.

The singer, who said he made the decision with 'great regret', said the club needed 'to lift its reputation out of the gutter'.

TV presenter Charlie Webster, sixties pop star Dave Berry and Sheffield businesswoman Lindsay Graham have all resigned as patrons of the club since Evans returned to training.

Ched Evans served half of his five-year jail term for raping an intoxicated 19-year-old woman

Man City (2007-09): 16 games, 1 goal

Norwich (loan, 2007-08): 28 games, 10 goals

Sheff Utd (2009-12): 103 games, 42 goals

Wales (2008-11): 13 games, 1 goal

Olympic athlete Jessica Ennis-Hill asked for her name to removed from a stand at the club's Bramall Lane ground if Evans returns full-time.

Heaton told Channel 4 News: 'I'm not saying Ched Evans shouldn't be given a second chance. What I was most worried about, and the reason for resigning my position, was he was going to be given another chance at the place of work he was at when he committed the offence.

'Football is unique in the sense that if it was any other normal job he wouldn't be considered for a position in that same place of work.

'The least Mr Evans can do is distance himself, rather than walking out of prison into a Sheffield United shirt. I don't think that's rehabilitation at all. I don't think there's any remorse there.

'I just think you have to move on from the place where it was done and I think everybody would benefit from that.

'He's got the human right to be a footballer but I think it makes common sense he doesn't do it at Sheffield United. I don't believe he can't be rehabilitated and I don't believe people should serve a life sentence.'

On United's stance, Heaton added: 'If there's anything my club is guilty of, it's not showing leadership.

'I think the club has to come out with some sort of statement, not only on Ched Evans, but where they stand.'

'Look at football in general, the PFA and FA have been silent on this and silent on a lot of crimes - and it seems to be particularly when women are involved.'
