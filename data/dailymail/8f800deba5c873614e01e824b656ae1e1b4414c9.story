Just looking at the photograph is enough to make you feel queasy.

So spare a thought for the poor passengers inside this ferry, pictured as it battled through a violent storm off the Sussex coast.

And perhaps spare a thought for the photographer too who was also at sea during the rough seas.

Stormy seas: David Lyons' black and white image of a ferry, with passengers on board, leaving Newhaven harbour, East Sussex, in a violent storm won the Your View category in the Take A View - Landscape Photographer Of The Year Awards

Top prize: This beautiful image, called Mist And Reflections taken on Crummock Water, Cumbria, by Tony Bennett was the overall winner of the competition

David Lyons captured the dramatic black and white image of the vessel as it left Newhaven harbour in East Sussex.

It shows the ferry, barely visible through mist and spray, being pummelled by huge waves.

The striking photograph was declared the winner of the Your View category in the Take A View Landscape Photographer Of The Year Awards.

The overall winner was an image of mists drifting across a still English lake on an autumn morning.

Derbyshire-based photographer Tony Bennett captured the poignant image of Crummock Water in Cumbria through his camera lens.

Haunting: This black and white image of a group of friends playing around in an avenue of trees called Mystical Morning was taken by Bob McCallion and won the Living The View category

Winter scene: This image, titled Ghost Of Rannoch Moor, was taken by David Breen at the edge of Loch Rannoch in Scotland

The image, dubbed Mists And Reflections, earned Mr Bennett £10,000 prize money.

Mr Bennett said capturing moments like the one he did was what drew him to photography.

'Every second the scene was changing, creating a hundred memorable images but this moment particularly caught my attention,' he said.'The still night mist began rolling and tumbling, as if in protest, as the heat of the sun vapourised and dispersed it forever.' 

While Mr Bennett took the top prize, 
winners and runners-up were announced in 15 other categories - including
 Classic View, Urban View and Lines In The Landscape.

Steam and iron: This photograph of a steam train rattling over a bridge called Caught In A Web Of Iron, was taken in North Queensferry, Fife, by David Cation. It won the Network Rail Lines In The Landscape award

The image of an snow topped island in the middle of an expansive lake won the Classic View category.

Another, called Caught In A Web Of Iron, was taken in North Queensferry, Fife, by David Cation and won the Lines In The Landscape award, sponsored by Network Rail.
