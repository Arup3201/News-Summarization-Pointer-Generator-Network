Deadly allergies mean this little boy must spend most of his life in isolation but it does not mean he gets out of doing his school homework.

In place of seven-year-old Devon Carrow-Sperduti, he sends a robot to school, allowing him to answer questions in class and even be part of schoolyard gossip, all while he sits in the safety of his bedroom, five miles away.

The amazing technology, called the VGo robot, has an interactive screen allowing Devon to interact with his classmates, despite never having met them face-to-face, at Winchester Elementary School in West Seneca, New York.

Life of isolation: Devon Carrow-Sperduti, 7, has deadly allergies which mean he must spend most of his life in isolation but a robot in the school classroom, allows him to answer the teacher's questions and be part of schoolyard gossip

A 'virtual Devon': The robot has an interactive screen which allows Devon to mix with his classmates, despite never having met them face-to-face

Devon's robot has his own desk in the classroom and can volunteer to answer his teacher's questions with a flashing light, rather than raising his hand.

Mother Rene said the $5,000 (£3,100) robot stops Devon from becoming a social recluse.

She said: ‘The children don't call the machine the “VGo”, it's just Devon.

‘The VGo is basically a virtual 
Devon. It helps him feel included, and realise that he still has to go 
to school the same as any other child.

‘The only thing that's different is Devon is not in the classroom. 

‘He's
 required to do everything every other kid does in the class. He doesn't
 get any special treatment, because he has to be treated just the same 
as everybody else.’

Part of the class: The robot means Devon can go to school like any other child, allowing him to have a chance at having a proper childhood

Five miles away: Devon uses his computer at home which sends wireless signals to the robot at school enabling him to see his teacher, the blackboard and his classmates, as well as to move about the school

There is a high-definition camera on his computer at his bedroom desk and on the top of the VGo machine, which stands at about the height of a primary school pupil, and is on wheels, making it mobile like a Segway.

From his home in Buffalo, New York, 
Devon uses a computer screen to send wireless signals to the VGo, 
enabling him to see his teacher, the blackboard, and the other children 
in his class, as well as to move about the school.

Rene said the robot is the ideal solution to Devon debilitating condition.

She said: ‘Devon has so many 
allergies that can be fatal to him, many of them are airborne, and we 
just can't risk his life by letting him mix with other children.

‘If
 my elder son, Dylan, occasionally has friends over to the house, they 
have to shower and scrub down like they've been exposed to radiation.

Not a recluse: The amazing technology, known as VGo, makes Devon feel included and his mother Rene says 'the children don't call the machine the "VGo", it's just Devon'

Deadly allergies: The boy has so many deadly allergies, many airborne, that can be fatal and so he is unable to mix with other children. When he is in contact with other people, they must shower, scrub down and wear clothes washed and ironed by Devon's mother

Honour to have him: Kathleen Brachmann, the principal at Winchester Elementary School said it is a 'great opportunity' to have Devon able to attend the school through the robot

‘I have to keep set of clothes that I
 have washed and ironed that I have to ask guests to wear, to make sure 
Devon never comes into contact with his allergies.

‘He
 has been in the intensive care unit three times after suffering near 
deadly reactions in the past and hospitalised countless times.

‘I
 can't ask every child in a school to constantly scrub their hands, 
brush their teeth and use mouthwash in case they have come into contact 
with any nuts.

‘It's not practical and it's not fair
 but I also don't think Devon should be denied the chance of a proper 
childhood, so the robot is the ideal solution.’

The
 family had not heard of the VGo until local education bosses suggested 
the newly-developed technology as a possibility when Devon was due to 
start school this year.

Listen and learns: Devon's first-grade teacher Jennifer Szewc said that the robot's flashing light, which Devon uses to answer a question, is just 'like another hand in the room'

The school’s principal Kathleen Brachmann said: ‘There was no hesitation in us accepting Devon.

‘I don't know if you'd get that every place. That's just how we are here.

‘A lot of people look at it as a challenge, we look at it as a great opportunity. We feel like it's an honour to have him here.’

Devon’s first-grade teacher Jennifer Szewc said: ‘One of the great things about the VGo is that Devon could turn and talk.

‘I could say, “could you go join me on the carpet?” and he would.

‘When he would turn on his light, it was like another hand up in the room.’

Devon was diagnosed with eosinophilic
 esophagitis disease, an allergic inflammatory response in the 
oesophagus, when he was just six-months-old along with anaphylactic 
shock syndrome, respiratory distress syndrome and asthma.

'Boy in a bubble': Devon was diagnosed with eosinophilic esophagitis disease, an allergic inflammatory response in the esophagus, and is restricted to eating just corn, apples and potatoes

As well as being unable to go to school, Devon survives on a restricted diet, eating just corn, apple and potatoes.

Rene, a social worker, said: ‘He's a walking time bomb.

‘He
 also suffers from severe skin allergies. His hands get red and scaly 
easily. They become so irritated, sometimes the skin splits open and he 
can't pick up a pen to write.

‘Even the smell of fabric softener can cause his throat to close.

‘He's almost like the boy in a bubble. I try to let him do some things. I want him to have the best life he could have.’

Boy, not a robot: Devon's (left) family were touched when his classmates made get-well-soon cards for him after a near fatal allergic reaction, for which he has been hospitalised for several times (right), drawing pictures of him as a boy, not a robot

After a near-fatal allergic reaction, Devon’s family were touched when his classmates made get-well-soon cards, drawing Devon as a boy, not a robot.

Rene said: ‘We are just so thankful that the school has accepted Devon in this way and really proud that he has been able to overcome his disability.’

A room in the family home has been made into a dedicated classroom and teachers have made it look every bit the part.

Walls are adorned with a dry-erase board detailing Devon's daily schedule. There are placards with the alphabet, numbers, verbs and adverbs, just like in a real schoolroom.
