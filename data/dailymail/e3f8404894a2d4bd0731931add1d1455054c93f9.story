David Cameron faces the humiliating prospect of the Conservatives being pushed into third place in May’s European elections.

A damning new poll reveals the Tories are on course to come behind Labour and the UK Independence Party – the first time it would be outside the top two in election history.

Leading Tory backbencher Liam Fox today piled pressure on the Prime Minister, admitting ‘anything could happen’ when voters go to the polls.

Ukip leader Nigel Farage predicts he will trigger a political 'earthquake' by topping the Euro elections, while David Cameron is under pressure from Eurosceptics in the Tory party see off the threat of Ukip

Ukip leader Nigel Farage has predicted he will trigger an ‘earthquake’ in British politics if his party tops the poll in May when MEPs are elected to the Brussels Parliament.

Mr Cameron hoped to head off the threat from the anti-EU party with a pro0mise of an in-out referendum if he is Prime Minister after 2015.

But a growing Tory revolt over Europe, demanding a veto for the British parliament to reject any Brussels law, has exposed deep divisions on the government benches.

A new opinion poll today puts Labour on course to come first, with Ukip in second followed by the Conservatives.

A Tory rebellion over Europe has descended into farce after Number 10 revealed it has never received a controversial letter from rebels.

David Cameron came under intense pressure at the weekend over claims 95 Tory MPs had signed a letter calling for the UK government to have the right to veto any EU laws.

It then emerged that some MPs included in the list had not actually signed it.

Treasury select committee chairman Andrew Tyrie insisted his name had been included error, and at least six others were also mistakenly added.

Now it has been revealed that the letter was never actually sent to Number 10, and does not actually exist.

A response to a Freedom of Information request by The Times said: 'A search of our records has not identified that we have received the letter to which you refer.'

Bernard Jenkin, the Tory MP who co-ordinated the letter, said he had passed the names to Mr Cameron's parliamentary aide Gavin Williamson, rather than send an actual letter.

Liam Fox, a standard bearer of the Tory right, today refused to say whether he had signed it, but hinted at the confusion.

Asked if had backed the letter, he told Radio 4: 'That is for me to know and the Prime Minister to know... or not know.'

The YouGov survey for The Sun put Labour on 32 per cent and Ukip on 26 per cent, with the Tories trailing on 23 per cent and Liberal Democrats a distant fourth on 9 per cent.

If the findings were repeated on May 22 with a uniform swing, they would see Conservative representation at the European Parliament slashed by 11 to 15 MEPs.

Labour would have 28 (up 15), Ukip 23 (up 10), and the Lib Dems' 11 MEPs would be completely wiped out, according to The Sun's calculations.

Mr Farage has predicted that Ukip will come first in May: ‘My ambition and my conviction is we could come first in those European elections and cause an earthquake in British politics.’

Tory strategists are working to limit the damage on Mr Cameron if the party loses MEPs.

Today senior Conservative Mr Fox declined to say whether his party could beat Ukip.

‘I think pretty much anything could happen in May, because I think that voters will very much see the European elections as a referendum on a referendum,’ he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.

‘I think it's very important that the Conservative party is defined by the national interest, that we decide we have to have a rational and reasonable debate about our role in Europe and our role in the world, and also Europe's role in the world.

‘One of my biggest problems in this debate is not that it's just about Britain's relationship with Europe, it's where does Europe now stand in terms of a very competitive global economy.’

But Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg accused the Conservatives of engaging in an 'unholy bidding war' with the UK Independence Party over who can sound most anti-European, which could end in Britain leaving the European Union.

The Liberal Democrat leader insisted he will not tone down his party's pro-European message, following a poll suggesting his MEPs are set to be wiped out in this year's elections to the European Parliament, while Conservatives slump to third place behind Labour and the UK Independence Party.

Mr Clegg said it would be 'economic suicide' for Britain to quit the EU, and that Tories and Ukip were indulging in 'silly political games' which could put millions of jobs at risk.

He insisted the Lib Dems would campaign as the pro-EU 'party of in'.

Asked how they would vote in a general election, 39 per cent of people backed Labour compared to 33 per cent for the Tories. YouGov interviewed 1,893 adults for The Sun on January 14 and 15

Mr Clegg added: 'I really genuinely feel that we are 
getting to the point in the debate where you've got this unholy bidding 
war between the Conservative Party and Ukip as to who can sound more 
breathless in their condemnation of all things European and, before you 
know it, this country will find itself outside of the European Union.

'I think this will mean we will be less relevant and powerful around the world, we would have less influence around the world.

'But
 crucially you would have fewer people in work, because being in Europe 
at the end of the day means being in work. I am not going to stand idly 
by while people play ever more silly political games and jeopardise 
millions of jobs in this country.'

However, in a sign that voters will use the European elections to inflict a bloody nose on the Tories, a separate poll on voting intentions for the 2015 general election was very different.

It put Labour on 39 per cent, Conservatives 33 per cent and Ukip 12 further behind on 12 per cent and the Lib Dems on 10 per cent.
