Three astronauts have arrived on the International Space Station after successfully hitching a lift on a Russian-built shuttle.

NASA astronaut Joseph Acaba and Russian cosmonauts Gennady Padalka and Sergei Revin are set for a four-and-half-month stay in space, after docking with the ISS in the early hours of this morning.

The astronauts were aboard the Soyuz craft for two days, as they made their 240-mile vertical trip.

It is a busy week in space - in two days there is a planned launch of the privately owned SpaceX's Dragon Capsule from Cape Canaveral.

After safely docking on the ISS, the three astronauts had to wait for about three hours as leak and pressure checks were carried out, before they were finally welcomed by their new crew mates.

The $100billion space station is currently occupied by Russian cosmonaut Oleg Kononenko, NASA astronaut Don Pettit and Holland's Andre Kuipers.

Before they left, Soyuz Commander Gennady Padalka, Flight Engineer Sergei Revin of Russia, and U.S. prime NASA Flight Engineer Joe Acaba were blessed by priests and wished well from dozens of onlookers that saw their spacecraft leave the Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan.

Three minutes into the flight, the crew members gave a thumbs-up signal to a camera on board the capsule. An anchor inside Mission Control outside Moscow told assembled scientists and students that the three astronauts were feeling well.

Nasa, which officially retired its shuttle fleet last year, has relied exclusively on Russian Soyuz craft for space station crew transport since late 2009.

According to the organisation more than 1,500 launches have been made with the craft to orbit satellites for telecommunications, Earth observation,weather and scientific missions, as well as for human flights.

A Soyuz space capsule took the first crew to the International Space Station in November 2000 and since that time, at least one Soyuz has always been at the Station, generally to serve as a lifeboat should the crew have to return to Earth unexpectedly.

After the Columbia accident in February 2003, the Soyuz TMA became the means of transportation for crewmembers going to or returning from the orbiting laboratory.

However, Tuesday's flight was delayed from March 30 to allow Russia's partly state-owned space contractor, RKK Energia, to prepare a new capsule for launch after an accident during pressure tests damaged the Soyuz crew capsule.

Moscow hopes a smooth mission will begin to restore confidence in its once-pioneering space programme after a string of launch mishaps last year, including the failure of a mission touted as post-Soviet Russia's interplanetary debut.

The Soyuz spacecraft is always launched to the Space Station from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan aboard a Soyuz rocket.

Oncethe Soyuz reaches orbit, it spends two days chasing the Station. The crew performs systems checks and keeps in touch with controllers at the Russian Mission Control Center during that time.

A Soyuz trip to the station takes two days from launch to docking, but the return to Earth takes less than 3.5 hours.

The previous crew of three at the ISS returned from the station in late April, following a delay due to safety fears after an unmanned Russian Progress craft taking supplies to the station broke up in the atmosphere in August.
