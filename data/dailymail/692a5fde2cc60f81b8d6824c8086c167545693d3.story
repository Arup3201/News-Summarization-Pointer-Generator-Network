Nasa originally developed the VISIA machine to test the effects of zero gravity on astronauts

It has been tested by Nasa's finest at the final frontier.

Now, a decade later, a skin-scanning 
contraption invented to monitor the effects of radiation and zero 
gravity on astronauts' skin as they traversed the universe has, for the 
first time, become available to mere mortals.

The
Visia Complexion Skin Analysis Machine reveals the condition of the 
skin below the surface, and compares your results with other women of 
the same age and ethnicity.

Consultants assess your results and prescribe products that they claim will take light years off your age.

Realising that their product could work back on earth too, Nasa's bright sparks decided to take their machine mass market.

The 20-minute skin test is available 
to try free at Wholefoods, in London's Picadilly, where staff say it is 
already proving popular.

In 
the US, where it has been rolled out in 26 shops over the past year, the
service has already been credited with boosting sales of the 
accompanying Mychelle product range by 3-400 per cent.

The space age technology has been available in specialist clinics for some time, but this is the first time the analysis valued at £120 has been available for free.

Using different types of light exposure it takes digital and UV pictures of your face to examine age spots, UV spots, brown spots, red areas, wrinkles, skin texture as well as pores and acne-causing bacteria

Using
different types of light exposure it takes digital and UV pictures of 
your face to examine age spots, UV spots, brown spots,  red areas, 
wrinkles, skin texture as well as pores  and acne – causing bacteria.

Wholefoods
say that the 'multi-spectral imaging to reveal damage on and beneath 
the surface of our skin that is not detectable by visual examination 
alone'.

Skin care consultant Claudia Hoppenot explained: 'It's like getting a diagnosis and then collecting a prescription.

'There is plenty you can do about the signs of ageing, wrinkles, redness and acne scars.

By using products that we recommend you can reverse damage and reduce visual impact of brown spots.'

The results can serve as a powerful wake-up call, experts say.

Cosmetic dermatologist Dr Sam Bunting 
said: 'I think that the Visia can be a really powerful motivator when it
comes to getting patients to wear their sunscreen and abandon bad 
habits, like sunbeds.

'It is
able to demonstrate subsurface damage due to ultraviolet rays and I 
think this is often a bit of a wake-up call for people to start taking 
better care of their skin.'

But aesthetic doctor Mervyn Patterson said he said he feared people could be frightened by the results.

He
said: 'This machine could be abused. Clinics can interpret the results 
and treatment however they want. If it’s not interpreted by an 
experienced, honest and decent person people can be misled.

'There too much PR and marketing here that can be preempted as science to people who may be frightened into things.'

This is not the first time that a NASA developed product has been found to have uses.

A
groundbreaking study showed that a fruit drink known as AS10 developed 
by the space agency to protect astronauts from radiation can rejuvenate 
the skin, dramatically reduces wrinkles, blemishes and sun damage after 
four months.

And in February
this year a tiny under-the-skin capsule made of carbon nano tubes that 
automatically diagnoses a problem and releases a substance to combat, it
was revealed.
