A furious man hit his girlfriend on the head with an anger management book during a row, it has been claimed.

Sheelah Thompson, 22, says Tyler Ford strangled her, threatened to kill her and put her phone in the oven to stop her from calling 911, according to a report filed with Spartanburg County deputies in South Carolina.

The report alleges that Ford, 23, kept asking Thompson why she was provoking him when she knew he was taking anger management classes.

It is claimed that as Thompson shrugged, Ford rolled up his anger management book and hit her on her foot and cheek with it.

According to the report, Thompson left the apartment but then returned and began hitting her boyfriend. The row escalated before he allegedly hit her before she stabbed him with a box-cutter. 

Both were arrested and Thompson was charged with criminal domestic violence high and aggravated while Ford was charged with criminal domestic violence second offense.
