A 12-year-old Michigan boy who has been charged with stabbing to death a nine-year-old neighbor  had been the victim of domestic abuse and lived in deplorable conditions, according to newly released court documents. 

An allegedly suicidal Jamarion Lawhorn knifed Michael Connor Verkerke four times in the back while they were on a playground earlier this month, having never met his victim before.

Court filings obtained by WOOD-TV this week shed light on the young murder suspect's unstable home environment, where Jamarion was allegedly subjected to abuse at the hands of his mother and stepfather.

Broken home: Anita Lawhorn, pictured with her son, Jamarion, left, allegedly abused the boy and his siblings, which resulted in temporary loss of custody in 1996 

Official 
documents indicated that the teen lived in a 'deplorable' home with no 
sheets or blankets on the beds, no utilities, and drug paraphernalia 
scattered about the bathroom. Jamarion and his siblings also had no access to a primary care doctor or a dentist.

Anita Lawhorn, Jamarion's mother, has had run-ins with the law dating back to 1996 concerning instances of child abuse.

The
 mother was forced to give up her daughters in upstate New York after 
her one-year-old suffered four broken bones and her three-year-old was 
found with cigarette burn marks on her chest.

Just
 days after Jamarion stabbed to death Michael Verkerke, the state 
removed Ms Lawhorn's three remaining children between the ages of 2 and 
14.

During
 his interviews with police, the 12-year-old suspect said that he had 
been mocked by other students in school, but he made no mention of abuse 
at the hands of his parents.

Bill
 Verkerke, the victim's grandfather, expressed anger at state officials 
upon learning of the abuse allegations concerning Anita Lawhron.

‘She
 should be held criminally accountable,’ Connor Verkerke’s 
grandfather told WOOD-TV. ‘Not only for what she did to her son, but maybe for what 
her son did to my grandson.’

Furious: Bill Verkerke, the victim's grandfather, has pointed a finger of blame at Anita Lawhorn for his grandson's tragic death

The mother of four and her live-in boyfriend, Bernard Harrold, were investigated for child abuse in 2013, with Jamarion listed as the victim.

The couple were forced to take parenting classes, but no charges have been filed against them.

Jamarion Lawhorn spent several months living in upstate New York with his biological father,  Lonnell Washington, but he returned to his mother's home in Michigan in June.

Following the deadly stabbing August 4, police found bruises all over on Jamarion Lawhorn’s body, which the boy said he suffered at the hands of his stepfather.

Anita Lawhorn admitted to police that she and Bernard Harrold 'have been continuously threatening to give Jamarion a “whoppin’” on a daily basis.'

The mother of four also said that she has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder and depression, but has not been taking her medications, according to MLive.com. Mr Harrold also said he has PTSD and anxiety.

Both Lawhorn and Harrold have tested positive for cocaine, according to court records.

The Grand Rapids Press reported earlier this month that Anita has been beside herself since she rushed to Mercy Health Saint Mary's hospital August 4 to be with her 12-year-old.

Horrific:
 Michael 'Conner' Verkerke died Monday night after being stabbed in the 
back multiple times and he and friends played on a playground near his 
home

Shocking:
 Jamarion Lawhorn, 12, is charged with murder. He will be tried as an 
adult in juvenile court. Even prosecutors said he looked small and young
 for his age

Police
 Jamarion didn't know Conner before the attack. They say the two boys 
had been playing together when Jamarion pulled a knife out of the sand 
and stabbed Conner multiple times in the back

'She kept asking him why he did this, why he would stab a little boy, how he would feel if that had been someone else doing this to his sisters,' Kentwood police Officer Darrin Cline wrote in police reports, according to The Detroit Free Press.

According to the harrowing police report of the brief time Anita spent with her son at the hospital, Jamarion showed little to no emotion as his mother scalded him.

'He had a stone-faced expression while his mother told him that he was going to be in a lot of trouble and that the boy had passed away.

'Lawhorn’s expression softened slightly when his mother was telling him that he was going to be gone for a long time facing the consequences of his actions. 

'She told him that the next time he would set foot in her house would be when he is a grown man,' Cline wrote according to The Detroit Free Press.

When asked by officers if there were any previous indicators that could have warned her about any disturbing behavior, Anita said that once, Jamarion set fire to her bed three years ago, to see what would happen.

'Anita said other than this he gets in trouble for normal kid things and she is shocked at his actions today,' the officer wrote.

It was reported earlier this month that Jamarion told officers he had been planning his murder for a year.

Jamarion Lawhorn also said he wanted to go to jail, did not know his young victim and that he's 'bad and always does stupid things', according to a delinquency petition filed in Kent County Circuit Court.

WZZM 13 reported the teen wanted to die and 'take somebody with him', so he swallowed some pink pills he found at home, took an eight-inch steak knife from the kitchen and walked half a mile to the Pinebrook Village playground.

Lawhorn then went up behind Michael ‘Connor’ Verkerke, 9 - who was playing at the small jungle gym with his brother and a friend - and stabbed him repeatedly in the back.

About 100 people gathered two weeks ago to celebrate Connor's memory and sing Jesus Loves Me

Seriously injured, Connor was helped back to his home 100 feet away by his seven-year-old brother Kameron Verkerke.

The boys' great uncle, Jim Stearns, told MLine that Connor, on the brink of death, told his brother: 'If anything happens to me, it’s not your fault. I’ll always love you.' 

Connor later died in hospital.

Lawhorn left the playground and called police to turn himself in.

He initially said he wasn't concerned for the victim, then said he was concerned because "it made him feel stupid," an investigator wrote.

He is designated as an adult in the juvenile court system, which would allow the boy, if convicted, to be sentenced as a juvenile and then as an adult once he turns 21.

Lawhorn's attorney, Charles Boekeloo, has entered a not-guilty plea on behalf of his client client.

Horrific:
 A 9-year-old boy died at the hospital after being attacked on the 
playground by a 12-year-old, police say. He was stabbed at least once in
 the back with a kitchen knife

The Grand Rapids Press reported that Jamarion sobbed and trembled as he appeared in court two weeks ago to face murder charges. Even the prosecutor, who has opted to try him in juvenile court as an adult, remarked that he looked 'tiny' and younger than his age.

His mother appeared in court with him and wiped away his tears and rubbed his back to comfort him.

Jamarion's lawyer asked that the boy undergo a psychological examination to determine if he is fit to stand trial.

The 12-year-old did, however, tell a judge that he understood the charges against him.

Under Michigan law, Jamarion could be given a 'blended' sentence if he is convicted, which would keep him in a juvenile detention facility until he is 21. After that, a judge would determine whether he should be released or sent to adult prison. 

Random:
 Police say the 12-year-old didn't know the young boy he attacked and he
 didn't live in the trailer park near the playground

Police say that Jamarion's attack on Conner was unprovoked and inexplicable. He didn't know Conner before the attack and had joined the 9-year-old and two friends on the playground.

Suddenly, he pulled a knife out of the sand and stabbed Conner multiple times in the back, authorities say. Police aren't saying where Jamarion got the weapon.

Conner ran to his home house nearby and collapsed on the porch. He was taken to the hospital in critical condition an died hours later.

Authorities say Jamarion is the youngest child ever charged with murder in Kent County - and one of the youngest in the state of Michigan. An 11-year-old boy was convicted of killing his mother's boyfriend in 1997 in Pontiac, Michigan.

Witness Glen Stacy told the Press he was doing yard work when Jamarion approached him and asked to borrow his cell phone. Mr Stacy said he assumed the child was calling him mother. Instead the 12-year-old called cops and admitted to a brutal crime.

Mr Stacy says the boy told police: 'I want to die. I don’t want to be on this earth anymore. Please pick me up.'

He says Jamarion told him that he lashed out because he had 'taken many pills' and nobody loved him.

The 12-year-old was eerily calm and patiently waited for police, Mr Stacy told the Press.

He only became animated when police finally arrived - and didn't immediately arrest him. Mr Stacy said the first emergency personnel went to the playground to help the victim. This upset the boy.

'Hello. I’m right here. You’re going the wrong way,' Jamarion shouted as officers arrived.

When police did finally come for him, he walked toward the cops with his hands out in front of him - showing he wanted to be handcuffed.
