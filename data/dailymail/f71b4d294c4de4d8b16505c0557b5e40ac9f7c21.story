A Victoria's Secret model still faces a $300,000 lawsuit for allegedly trashing her $32,000-a-month apartment, even though she had tried to argue that she didn't live there.

A Manhattan judge ruled that Julie Ordon couldn't dodge the suit by her former landlord, who has accused her and her movie producer husband David Mimran of extensive damage to the home.

She had argued that she was responsible for the alleged $150,000 in damage because only her husband's name appeared on the lease and she did not live at the apartment on Greenwich Street.

But her landlord, Richard Sabella, argued that she kept a large wardrobe at the apartment while her husband was busy with work in California, the New York Post reported. The judge agreed.

Lawsuit: Model Julie Ordon and her husband David Mimran allegedly trashing their Manhattan apartment

'We're very pleased with the decision,' the landlord's lawyer, Joshua Price, told the paper. 'We got exactly what we wanted.'

Ordon, who has also featured in
 Playboy and Sports Illustrated, damaged 
'exquisite and valuable antiques, furniture and equipment' in the 
fully-furnished three-bedroom loft apartment, according to court papers.

The 29-year-old allegedly allowed her dog to soil the landlord's $18,000 Nepalese hand-loomed rug and destroyed his $45,000 Art Deco-style table, which took six months to fix, the Post reported.

The lawsuit added that they also made illegal alterations to the unit before leaving in August 2012.

Price claimed in court papers that the couple 
caused 'unspeakable damage' to the unit, the New York Daily News reported.

He said they damaged or ruined 'furniture, electronic systems, floor coverings and fixtures, which included many antiques and collectibles'.

'It appears that the damage was was intentional or the result of gross negligence,' the suit says.

Ordon's lawyer, Louis Biancone, said he believes the case will eventually be thrown out.

Ordon, 29, is originally from 
Switzerland and has appeared in Cosmo, Glamour and the French versions 
of Elle and Playboy, as well as campaigns for Chanel, Bebe and Guess.

Family: She has a four-year-old daughter, Mathilde (pictured), with her husband, and three step children

In
 October 2009, she was photographed pregnant for Vogue Germany and - 
just months later in 2010, she featured in the Sports Illustrated 
Swimsuit Issue.

She now lives in Midtown with Mimran, 46, and their four-year-old daughter Mathilda.

Mimran,
 who was previously married, is a Swiss-French businessman and movie 
producer. He signed the lease to the Greenwich Street condo in 2009 as 
he was going through a divorce.

When he signed the paperwork, he 'agreed to take good care of' the furnishings and 'return them without damage', documents show.

Last year, Mimran was accused of owing his first wife Lucy, a former model, half of their marital property.

2012 and allegedly damaged the landlord's expensive furniture and rugs

The $7.4 million divorce settlement included proceeds from the sale of a $23 million yacht, a $25 million Central Park West apartment designed by Philippe Stark and investments in a Cayman Islands company.

After fighting for equal custody of his children, Mimran left his sons in New York and moved to Switzerland with new wife Julie Ordon and their daughter Mathilda, the Post reported.

Lucy Mimran said she will pursue her ex overseas for the payment he still owes.
