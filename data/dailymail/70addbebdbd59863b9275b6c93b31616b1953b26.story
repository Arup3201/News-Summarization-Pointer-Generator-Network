E-cigarettes, speciality beers and protein powder have been added to the typical basket of goods used to calculate inflation.

Sweet potatoes also made it on to the list of commonly-bought products – while liver was re-introduced for the first time since 1999.

The alterations reflect the changing shopping habits and lifestyles of the typical Briton, with 13 items added and eight removed by the Office for National Statistics this year.

The Office for National Statistics revealed details of the items which will now be included in the 'basket of goods' to calculate inflation

The ONS yesterday revealed it had added e-cigarettes for the first time as the devices found popularity with smokers trying to quit.

Rising demand for ‘craft’ beer made by micro-breweries has also led to the inclusion of the ales, while protein powder features on the list after the ONS found it was increasingly used by fitness fanatics. The food supplement is dissolved in drinks and is supposed to help the body recover after strenuous workouts.

Statisticians added the ‘relatively new vegetable’ of sweet potato to reflect rising ‘interest’, and melons were added for the first time to widen the range of fruit being monitored.

Chilled pizza has replaced the frozen version as shoppers increasingly ditch freezer food in favour of fresher alternatives. The data suggested that DIY habits are also changing, with coloured paints replacing white.

Revealing a growing reliance on technology, phone chargers and covers and music streaming subscriptions such as Spotify were also added to the basket.

Changes in the cost of craft beers and ales are included for the first time to reflect 'the increase in expenditure and shelf space devoted to speciality/real ales'

Headphones, online gaming subscriptions and music streaming services like Spotify are also added to the basket

Changing fashions mean yoghurt drinks and sat-nav devices are no longer used to asses changes in the cost of living

Making their debut on the basket of 700 items were headphones – which can cost hundreds of pounds and have become a fashion accessory among teenagers – and online subscriptions for games console services. Although liver was re-introduced to represent ‘the market for offal’, officials said there had not been a particular rise in popularity of the food. Satnavs were axed as many cars now have built-in devices, while yoghurt drinks and lilies were also removed.

Carnations, which are more commonly found in stores, survived the cull. The typical basket has radically changed since the figures were first collected in 1947. In the 1940s, it included an unskinned wild rabbit, a gallon of lamp oil and a table mangle for wringing out wet washing. Clothes included a ready-made three-piece suit, Oxford shoes, back-lacing corsets and seamless rayon hose.

By the 1980s, these outmoded fashions had been replaced by tracksuits, trainers and jeans.
