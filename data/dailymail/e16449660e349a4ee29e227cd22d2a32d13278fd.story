Returning home from a tour of duty is a happy occasion for any soldier.

But Staff Sergeant Kevin Lloyd's homecoming was made all the more joyful when he saw that his wife Jo, who had been unhappy with her weight for years, had lost almost five stone while he was in Afghanistan.

Mother-of-four Jo, 34, from Essex, had struggled with her weight ever since giving birth to the couple's first child, and had soon ballooned to 17 stone and larger than a size 22.

But Kevin's absence provided just the 
kick she needed to drop four dress sizes and slim down 12 stone, a size 
14, the same size she was before starting a family.

Jo
had been gradually piling on the pounds during her 14 year marriage - 
particularly after the birth of each of their four children, Liam, 14, 
James, eight, Kieran, five and 18-month-old Fearne - but when Kevin 
suggested they renew their wedding vows the 
thought of walking down the aisle, almost ten dress sizes larger, forced
Jo to lose weight.

So when Kevin was deployed to 
Afghanistan, Jo joined Weight Watchers, enrolled at her local gym and 
went on to shed almost five stone - shrinking from 16 stone 11 to a 
slender 12 stone.

And 
eighteen months after her first slimming class, Jo slipped into a size 
14 dress - the same size as her original wedding dress - and walked down
the aisle to renew her wedding vows.

She said: 'We'd planned to renew our vows for our 10th wedding anniversary but I just didn't feel confident and knew the photographs would be horrible as I was so much bigger than when we first got married.

'I'd slowly put on weight having children and when Kevin went to Afghanistan I knew it was a good time to do something about it.'

Jo continued: 'He was away for six months and I lost a stone and a half, I felt so great I carried on. Kevin was back and fourth for the next year and each time he returned I'd lost more weight.

'He was very shocked when he first saw me and couldn't believe how much my shape had changed, but he's proud of what I've achieved.'

To lose the pounds, Jo swapped takeaways and chocolate for fruit and vegetables. She also started working out at the gym twice a week and took up Zumba dance classes.

Jo, pictured left before losing the weight, and right having lost almost five stone, said: 'When you've lost weight people look at you because you look nice, not because you're overweight'

She said: 'It took a lot of hard work but it was worth it, especially when you see the weight start to come off. The real milestone for me was when I could get into clothes that I hadn't been able to get into for years.

'My lifestyle has changed so much, I feel a lot healthier now and not so out of breath. I finally have the confidence to go into the room and not worry that people are staring at me.'

Jo and Kevin renewed their vows at Wimbish Church near their home in Essex last month.

And just eighteen months after struggling to fit in a size 22, Jo walked up the aisle the same dress size as when the couple first married 14 years ago.

Wedding days: Kevin and Jo have now renewed their marriage vows, and Jo was thrilled to be able to wear a dress the same size as the one she wore on her wedding day 15 years earlier

She said: 'I was so happy with myself. when I fit in a dress the same size as the one I wore on our wedding day all those years ago I couldn't quite believe it.

'It's a real achievement. I know I've still got a little way to go but I've had lots of support and achieved so much already, I know I can do it.

'I would say to anyone wanting to lose weight just take that first step.

'It will take a lot of hard work but it's worth it in the end when you can fit into clothes you've only ever dreamed of.

'When you've lost weight people look at you because you look nice, not because you're overweight.'

The happy couple: Jo is elated that now people look at her because she looks good, not because she is overweight
