As slim as ever: The Duchess remained elegant with the merest hint of a baby bump

With only three months left to go, many mothers-to-be would have started to resign themselves to maternity wear, elasticated waistbands and comfortable flats.

Not the Duchess of Cambridge. And while it’s hardly surprising that she remains as elegant as ever, she also appears to be almost as slim as ever, with the merest hint of a baby bump.

Despite being six-months pregnant, the sporty royal looked slim as she played basketball and table tennis.

And although there may have been little physical sign of her pregnancy as she visited a homeless shelter in Glasgow yesterday with Prince William, a beaming Kate was unusually happy to reveal details about her condition.

Dressed in a chic tartan coat and her trademark black suede boots, Kate said she plans to go on maternity leave from her royal duties from ‘around June time’.

The duchess, who is six months’ pregnant, also revealed that her due date is ‘around mid-July’ – a slightly more precise hint than the official announcement.

St James’s Palace has previously only confirmed the royal couple’s baby will be born ‘in July’, with officials refusing to give the exact due date.

Kate, 31, also said that she and William had drawn up a list of boys’ and girls’ names for their first child – and that she has taken up knitting. ‘I’ve been trying to knit and I’m really bad. I should be asking for tips,’ she said.

When Rachel Sawyer, a project manager at the shelter, asked when her due date was and if she had any names, Kate replied: ‘It’s around mid-July but apparently babies have their own agenda …

‘We have a shortlist for both [boy and girl] but it’s very difficult. My friends keep texting me names.’

And when asked if she had got her nursery ready, she smiled and said: ‘No... we have got a lot to do!’

During the visit, Kate also got an unusual insight into being a mother – from an eight-month-old baby with a taste for flowers. The duchess chatted to Heidi Addison and her mother Shirley, who had a bouquet of flowers to give to Kate, while they were in a crowd outside a sports centre.

Mrs Addison, who represented Team GB at the hammer throwing in the 2004 Athens Olympics, said: ‘Kate came over after spotting Heidi and she asked her name and how old she is.

‘We said we had flowers for a special someone. I told her it was the most amazing experience ahead of her.

‘But she needed to be careful because Heidi was more interested in trying to eat the flowers.’ 

At the shelter, the Quarriers Project, William looked awkward when he was asked to do some DJ-ing.  He joked it was harder than flying a helicopter – and after his attempt at ‘scratching’, Kate said to him: ‘Step away from the music’.

The duchess showed her usual tact in her outfit yesterday, giving a nod to her Scottish title as she wrapped up against the chill in a short tartan coat.

Known as the Countess of Strathearn when north of the border, Kate often pays tribute to the people of Scotland by wearing a flash of tartan. 

Yesterday, however, her £425 blue and grey Workers Coat came from Gloucestershire-based firm Moloh – which describe the coat as part of it English Women’s Clothing range.

If the couple’s baby arrives in mid-July, he or she will be born under the star sign of Cancer.

Cancerians – including Prince William’s mother Diana, who was born on July 1, and his stepmother Camilla who celebrates her birthday on July 17 – are said to be ‘soft, sensitive and affectionate’.
