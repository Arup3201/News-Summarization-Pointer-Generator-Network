Angry congressional Republicans have commanded Secretary John Kerry to testify in a May 21 hearing about why the State Department hid documents showing how the aftermath of the deadly 2012 terror attack in Benghazi unfolded.

They are also launching a new investigative 
committee to dig further into the scandal, which erupted just weeks 
before President Obama's re-election. He insisted at the time that 
al-Qaeda was 'on the run,' but documents now confirm that the State Department knew immediately that it was a terror attack carried out by an al-Qaeda-affiliated group.

Two emails have emerged in the past 24 hours that suggest Obama administration officials knew immediately that the group, Ansar al-Shariah, laid waste to U.S. diplomatic facilities in the Eastern Libyan city.

But the president, then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, then-UN Ambassador Susan Rice and other officials told the public that the deadly attack was the result of a spontaneous anti-America protest sparked by an anti-Islam video.

The State Department had concealed both documents from the public.

GOP Rep. Darrell Issa subpoenaed Secretary of State John Kerry on Friday, demanding answers to questions about how the Obama administration hid documents from the public that show the involvement of an al-Qaeda affiliate in the Benghazi attack was recognized immediately

Four Americans including the U.S. ambassador to Libya died on September 11, 2012 after Islamist militants launched military-style assaults on U.S. diplomatic facilities in Benghazi, LIbya

'Compliance with a subpoena for documents is not a game,' Issa wrote Kerry (pictured) -- reacting to the release of emails that the State Department has hidden from public view for 19 months

One showed Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes setting up a conference call to coach Rice on emphasizing the video during TV interviews. That email was only made public on Wednesday because of a lawsuit from the center-right group Judicial Watch.

Utah Republican Rep. Jason Chaffetz released the other email Thursday night.

Former CBS investigative reporter Sharyl Attkisson first reported that it showed Assistant Secretary of State Beth Jones writing to senior officials within hours of the Benghazi attack to explain that she had told Libya's U.S. ambassador 'the group that conducted the attacks – Ansar Al Sharia – is affiliated with Islamic extremists.'

'If the video was a cause' of the Benghazi attack,' Chaffetz asked Attkisson, 
'why did Beth Jones of the State Department tell the Libyan Ambassador 
that Ansar al-Shariah was responsible for the attack?'

Another 
State Department email in the same chain, sent while the attacks were still underway, noted that 'the extremist group 
Ansar Al Sharia has taken credit for the attack in Benghazi,' and that 
the U.S. had asked Libya's president and prime minister 'to pursue Ansar al Sharia.'

Four Americans, including U.S. 
Ambassador Christopher Stevens, were killed in the Benghazi attacks.

President
 Obama, who appeared in a joint press conference on Friday with German 
Chancellor Angela Merkel, was not asked about Benghazi. He answered 
questions about cyber-snooping, Russian aggression in Ukraine, and the 
death penalty.

Republicans have ratcheted up the pressure on the Obama administration in recent weeks.

'My instincts tell me that this story is never going to go away as long as they keep lying,' South Carolina Republican Rep. Lindsey Graham told Fox News on Friday.

California Republican Rep. Darrell Issa, who chairs the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, wrote to Kerry on Friday to demand his testimony, saying that the State Department has 'shown a disturbing disregard' for its 'legal obligations' to comply with congressional demands.

'Compliance with a subpoena for documents is not a game,' Issa wrote.

Assistant Secretary of State Beth Jones acknowledged in an email just hours after the deadly attack on U.S. diplomatic buildings in Benghazi that it was the work of Ansar al-Shariah, an al-Qaeda-affiliated militant group

The email from Jones, Assistant Secretary for European and Eurasian Affairs, was withheld from public view

'The
 fact that these documents were withheld from Congress for more than 19 
months is alarming. The Department is not entitled to delay responsive 
materials because it is embarrassing or implicates the roles and actions
 of senior officials.'

South
 Carolina Rep. Trey Gowdy will reportedly chair the special 'select' 
committee, a bipartisan panel that will have broad subpoena power and 
the ability to interrogate witnesses at length.

A Gowdy spokeswoman wouldn't confirm his selection on Friday, referring questions to House Speaker John Boehner's office.

Ordinary congressional committees typically allow members five minutes each for questions, a short enough time for witnesses to stall for time.

Boehner said Friday that the House will vote to establish the committee, a formality since his Republican conference is the controlling majority.

'Americans learned this week that the Obama Administration is so intent on obstructing the truth about Benghazi that it is even willing to defy subpoenas issued by the standing committees of the People's House,' Boehner said in a statement.

Speaker of the House Rep. John Boehner said Friday that a House vote will establish a 'select' committee to investigate the Benghazi debacle

South Carolina Republican Rep. Trey Gowdy's name is being floated as a likely chairman of the new committee

'The 
administration's withholding of documents – emails showing greater White
 House involvement in misleading the American people – is a flagrant 
violation of trust and undermines the basic principles of oversight upon
 which our system of government is built.  And it forces us to ask the 
question, what else about Benghazi is the Obama administration still 
hiding from the American people?'

The
 select committee will take over the work previously done by the Ways 
& Means and Oversight committees, and will likely count among its 
members many of those committees' members.

'Four Americans died at the hands of terrorists nearly 20 months ago, and we are still missing answers, accountability, and justice,' Boehner said.

Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus said in a statement that 'the American people want and deserve to know why the Obama White House and Democrats decided their political press strategy was more important than providing honest answers to the American people.'

'After a federal court forced the White House to turn over emails about Benghazi, it became clear that the administration attempted to mislead the American people. When confronted with this evidence, they continue to offer denials, non-answers, and lies. At this point, they’re lying about their lies.'
