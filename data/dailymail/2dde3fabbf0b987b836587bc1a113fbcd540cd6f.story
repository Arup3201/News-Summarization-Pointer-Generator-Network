French oyster buyers have turned to the British market because their own supplies have been obliterated by herpes, it emerged yesterday.

British oyster sellers claim they are experiencing a huge increase in sales after French suppliers started buying up their stock.

They are purchasing as many oysters as they can to replace their own dwindling numbers, caused by a new micro-variant of the infection - oyster herpesvirus.

Increase: French oysters have been hit by a new micro-variant of the infection - oyster herpesvirus

Infected oysters have a pungent odour but are harmless to humans.

The disease has always been present, but the new strain has become lethal and is now widespread in France - killing off the popular aphrodisiac.

Britain annually produces 1,100 tonnes of oysters and now around 15 per cent are immediately going abroad - with France the biggest market.

With Oyster sellers claiming the British market is finally picking up after being 'stagnant' for 30 years.

However, some are warning of a price hike in British stocks with Kent supplying the most and best quality shellfish in Britain.

Amazingly before numbers were hit by the debilitating disease France produced a whopping 130,000 tonnes.

John Bayes, who has run Seasalter Shellfish, in Reculver, Kent, for more than 50 years, says the British market is finally picking up.

He said: 'Yes, the French are coming over and buying in large numbers.

'Prices have been stagnant for 30 years, but over the past year, they have risen to a half decent level.

'It’s not as good as it used to be, but it’s getting better and we are just about matching inflation rises now.

'I have worked hard setting up links with French companies and that is going well.

'We are also setting up a new building to sell market oysters, which is an exciting project.'

David Jarrad, director of the Shellfish Association, said: 'The French have been to the UK and are buying as much as they can, both in market size oysters but also in half-grown stocks and in seed stocks.'

Oysters have long been associate with improving sex lives and infamous lover Casanova is believed to have eaten 50 every morning for breakfast.

Scientists also believe the high levels of zinc and amino acids help boost the libido in both sexes.
