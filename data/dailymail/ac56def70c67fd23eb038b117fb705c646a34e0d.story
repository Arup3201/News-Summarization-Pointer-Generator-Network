Sporting goods: Austin Rehkow appears destined for the NFL after hitting a 67-yard field goal

He has accomplished a feat that no professional football
player has ever done before - all at the tender age of 17.

Austin Rehkow, a senior at Central Valley High School in Spokane
Valley, Washington, was dispatched to do the near-impossible - nail a field
goal from 67 yards away.

The kick was good, tying the game.

Central Valley later won
the contest against Shadle Park High School in overtime by a score of 62-55.

A YouTube captured the record-breaking kick in all of its
glory, as the referees raised their hands to signify the kick was good, and the
team erupted in celebration.

The 67-yard kick is one of the longest in history, beating
the NFL record of 63 yards, which is currently held by four players.

Mr Rehkow is not just a gridiron guru in kicking the ball -
he can also catch it –doubling as a wide receiver on the field.

In addition, football’s not his only game, as Mr Rehkow plays
for the Central Valley basketball team when football season is over.

But as amazing as the kick is, it’s not even the longest at his
level. The high school mark belongs to Dirk Borgognone, who kicked a 68-yarder while
a student at Reno High School in 1985.

Four players have reached the 63-yard milestone in the NFL,
but none have broken it.

New Orleans Saints placekicker Tom Dempsey, who was born
without toes on his right foot, launched the first record when his kick was
good on November 8, 1970 against the Detroit Lions.

Dempsey’s record stood for nearly 28 years, until Denver
Broncos kicker Jason Elam matched it in a game against the Jacksonville
Jaguars.

On September 12, 2011, Sebastian Janikowski of the Oakland
Raiders kicked his way into the record books with a 63-yarder.

Last month, on September 9, 2012, David Akers of the San
Francisco 49ers joined the club when he nailed a 63-yard kick of his own that
hit off the crossbar.

Swedish kicker Ola Kimrin kicked a 65-yard field goal with
the Broncos in 2002, but it is not included in the record books because it was
during the preseason.
