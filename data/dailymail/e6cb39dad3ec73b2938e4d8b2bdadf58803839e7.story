It has been one of the most eagerly-awaited television series ever.

But as millions tuned in to watch the opening episode of Broadchurch’s second series on Monday, it emerged that the viewers are not the only ones waiting to find out what happens in the crime drama.

Producers of the ITV thriller have gone to such lengths to keep the plotline a mystery that even the actors themselves are unsure of how the eight-part series will conclude.

Mystery: Even the actors in Broadchurch have no idea how the show will finish, and multiple endings have been filmed to prevent it being leaked to the public

Different endings of the second series have been filmed in a further effort to prevent the final conclusion being leaked, while the script was released to cast members in small sections.

Arthur Darvill, who plays local vicar Paul Coates in the show, has revealed that not even cast members have been allowed to watch the second series in full.

‘I haven’t seen it,’ he said yesterday. ‘None of us have seen it. We’re not allowed to see any of it.

‘I’ve seen little bits of it but not a whole episode. From the little tiny nuggets I’ve seen it looks amazing.

‘There’s so many of us in it that we all concentrate on our own little bits, so I can’t wait to see everyone else in it.’

No clue: David Tennant said the cast was given their scripts as the production went along and no one knew what was about to happen

The second series has David Tennant and Olivia Colman reprising their roles as police officers Alec Hardy and Ellie Miller.

The first series, which was broadcast almost two years ago, focused on the death of 11-year-old Danny Latimer in the fictional town of Broadchurch.

It attracted more than nine million viewers and was tweeted about 470,000 times – the most for any ITV drama series.

Viewers have been excitedly debating the plot of the second series since filming began in May last year, although the programme’s creator Chris Chibnall has suggested that it will not be a murder mystery.

The Broadchurch cast have all been made to sign confidentiality agreements forbidding them from sharing any storyline elements.

There was security on set while filming in external locations so none of the residents of West Bay in Dorset, where the programme is filmed, could reveal the storyline.

 All scripts had an individual cast or crew member’s name across every page so that no piece of paper could be leaked without a name on it.

The same measures were also employed during the filming of the first series, with producers keeping the killer’s identity a secret from the cast until the final episode so the actors could not unwittingly display signs of innocence or guilt.

David Tennant said yesterday: ‘We all knew it was good as we made it and we were receiving the scripts as we went along and none of the cast and crew knew where it was going.

‘It became part of the national conversation which is something you always hope for with any piece of work you release out into the world, but you don’t really expect it.

‘When something takes off to that extent it is thrilling to be in the middle of it, but then there’s the notion that you might have to follow it up. Can you do anything other than disappoint?’
