'My life is in tatters': Kay Delany looks at pictures of her children as she tries to piece together her memories after a freak fall made her forget 20 years

The last thing Kay Delaney remembers is tucking her six-year-old son and two-year-old daughter into bed for the night.

Two decades on, those children have grown up and graduated  from university – but Miss Delaney cannot recall any of it.

After falling at work and hitting her head, more than 20 years have been erased from her memory.

She is convinced she is still in her 30s and is stunned every time she sees the face of a 55-year-old staring back at her from the mirror.

To her, it is still 1990, when Margaret Thatcher was prime minister and mobile phones were the size of bricks.

The mother of three cannot even remember the birth of her younger son James, now 19.

Before the accident, Miss Delaney worked as a care home manager and was in line for promotion, but she now finds it hard to make a cup of tea because she repeatedly forgets to switch the kettle on.

Yet she has shocked her partner by waking up in the middle of the night and reciting an Edith Piaf song in perfect French, despite not speaking the language.

Miss Delaney was diagnosed with retrograde amnesia after she slipped on a wet floor while working at Dove Court Care Home in Wisbech, Cambridgeshire.

She was told she had nothing more than a minor concussion and sent home from hospital.

However, it soon became clear that she was having problems with both short-term and long-term memory.

Since then, she has struggled with simple tasks such as cooking and cleaning, and her partner of four years, Robert, 60, has given up work to look after her.

Miss Delaney, who admits that it feels as if she is being hugged by strangers when her children Sandy, 23, Kenny, 27, and James embrace her, said: ‘I remember tucking the children into bed when they were about six and two.

'I have been left without a sense of 
motherhood': The last thing Miss Delaney, 55, remembers is putting her 
young son and daughter to bed in the early Nineties as a 34-year-old

'Then I woke up and it was 20 years 
later.

'I cannot even begin to describe the pain and sense of loss I feel
every day of not being able to remember my children growing up, let 
alone not being able to remember my youngest child.

Kay Delaney's brain injury has robbed her of the memories of her own life over the last 20 years, and everything that has happened in the wider world.

Among the events she can't remember are Nelson Mandela being released in 1990 and end of apartheid in South Africa, the break-up of the USSR in 1991.

Nor can she remember the two Gulf Wars, the opening of the Channel Tunnel in 1994, the death of Princess Diana in 1997, world-wide New Year's Eve celebrations on December 31, 1999, and September 11 in 2001.

Since 9/11, Kay can't recall the Boxing Day tsunami that struck parts of Asia in 2004, Hurricane Katrina in 2005, the election of America's first black President, Barack Obama, in 2008, and pop singer Michael Jackson's death in June 2009.

‘I have been left without a sense of 
motherhood as there is such a huge gap.

'I have no memory of their 
progress through childhood and teenage years, their troubles and 
triumphs, their friends and the laughter, tears and love that makes up 
normal family life.

‘I have no memory of my elder two 
children graduating from university. My youngest is a stranger to me.

'I 
have been able to develop a relationship of sorts with my elder two but 
it is more as friendship than mother and child. 

'The results of the accident have left my life in complete tatters.

‘My relationship with my partner is now under a lot of strain as I am almost totally dependent on him.’

Miss Delaney, from Newton, Cambridgeshire, suffered a minor traumatic brain injury when she slipped in July last year.

It has caused retrograde amnesia, short-term memory problems, anxiety and concentration issues.

She is a qualified nurse with a degree
in psychology and gave university lectures on behavioural psychology 
before the fall, but now fears she will never work again.

The accident is being investigated and Miss Delaney is considering fighting for compensation.

Jeanette Tasker of brain injury 
charity Headway said: ‘The severity of a brain injury does not always 
relate to the amount of memory loss someone has as a result.

Retrograde amnesia can completely change someone’s personality.’
