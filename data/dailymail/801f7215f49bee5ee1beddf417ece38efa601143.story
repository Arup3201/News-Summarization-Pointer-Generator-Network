Doctors began tests on stricken F1 legend Michael Schumacher's brain on Monday in a bid to precisely locate the area where he suffered massive damage in a post-Christmas ski accident.

Germany's Bild newspaper reported on Day 15 of Schumacher's artificially induced coma that the new tests are intended to discover which parts of his brain are functioning and which are dormant. He remains stable but critically ill.

Bild says that it has gleaned information from among the medical team treating him in Grenoble, France, that there are still great fears of 'unexpected complications,' such as a brain haemorrhage and infection.

Doctors began tests on stricken F1 legend Michael Schumacher's brain on Monday in a bid to precisely locate the area where he suffered massive damage in a post-Christmas ski accident

Risky: Eyewitnesses say the retired racing driver hit his head on one of the many rocks in the off-piste area (right) while skiing with his 14-year-old son Mick (believed to be pictured, above, with his father)

A
 Zurich newspaper reported on Sunday that a small part of his skull has 
been removed in a bid to relieve pressure on his brain. 

While experts concur that such procedures are effective in relieving the injured area they can cause even more damage.

Swiss
 neurosurgeon Frédéric Rossi told the Zurich Tagesanzeiger that the list
 of dangers from such an op 'is long, ranging from swelling to bleeding 
to the accidental opening of the brain's outer membrane.'

Treatment: Surgeons at Grenoble Hospital (pictured) are assessing Schumacher's recovery on an hourly basis

Protection: Jean-Francois Payen - an anaesthetist at the hospital - revealed that the F1 legend might not have survived the 'high-speed' fall if he had not been wearing a helmet

Schumacher,
 44, was out skiing with friends and his 14-year-old son Mick on 
December 29 when he fell on to rocks at the French resort of Meribel. 

He had to be helicoptered to hospital and has been fighting for his life ever since.

His
 wife Corinna and his two children remain at his bedside and high-profile figures from the world of F1, industry and 
showbiz continue to make brief visits to see him.

Overseeing his care: French surgeon Gerard Saillant, who operated on Schumacher when he broke his leg in an F1 crash in 1999, said he went to the hospital as 'friend' not a doctor

Eyewitnesses
 say Schumacher hit his head on one of the many rocks in the off-piste 
area - causing him to briefly lose consciousness. The fall was so hard 
that Schumacher's helmet cracked.

Brain
 surgeons battled throughout the 
night to save the retired racing driver's life, said his anaesthetist 
Jean-Francois Payen, who added: 'We are working hour by hour'.

He
 also revealed that Schumacher might not have survived the fall - if he had 
not been 
wearing a helmet.

Speaking
 at a press conference at the Grenoble Hospital, in eastern France, Mr 
Payen said: 'We judge him to be in a very serious situation. We cannot 
predict the future for Michael Schumacher.

Urgent: Surgeon Stephan Chabardes operated on the F1 legend to relieve bleeding and bruising in the brain

Media frenzy: Schumacher's medical team answers questions from dozens of journalists at Grenoble Hospital

'We cannot predict the future for Michael Schumacher': Medics told the throng of journalists that it was too early to make a prognosis

'It's too early to say what is going 
to happen and to have a prognosis. Taking into consideration the very 
violent shock, his helmet did protect him to a certain extent, of 
course.

'Somebody who would have this kind of accident without a helmet, certainly, he would not have got to here.'

Professor
 Stephan Chabardes, the neurosurgeon who operated on the F1 star, told 
the news conference: 'Mr Schumacher was taken by helicopter very quickly
 to Grenoble Hospital.

'On
 his arrival we examined him clinically and we realised he was in a 
serious condition, in a coma, with in fact cranial pressure.

'The
 brain scan showed a number of pieces of information, some intercranial 
haematoma (internal bleeding) but also some cerebral contusions 
(bruising of the brain tissue) and oedema (build-up of fluid).

'We operated urgently to try to 
eliminate the haematoma. After the operation we saw that we had been 
able to eliminate these haematoma but also sadly the appearance of 
various bilateral lesions.

'So therefore he was taken to intensive care to try to help.'
