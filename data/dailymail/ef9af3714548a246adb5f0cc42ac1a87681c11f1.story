If somebody gave us a quid every time Danny Welbeck's name was mentioned this week we'd have enough to put a few big bets on the Arsenal striker and plenty left in the kitty for a punt or two on Radamel Falcao.

Manchester United's late capture of Falcao brought the curtain down on the latest deadline day while Welbeck's switch from Old Trafford to the Emirates raised expectations (north London) and eyebrows (everywhere else).

Bookies opened a ton of markets on a host of Premier League new boys after the window closed but Falcao and Welbeck are attracting most attention.

Danny Welbeck will hope he can get off to a flyer in his Arsenal debut against Manchester City

Danny Welbeck is 4/1 with the bookies to score more than 14 Premier League goals this season

Two goals for England on Monday night could be the spark for a bright season for 23-year-old Welbeck, who is second-favourite behind Alexis Sanchez to be Arsenal's top Premier League scorer.

Some firms go 2/1 Welbeck with the Chile star 6/4 but Bet365 have the Englishman at 9/2 to top the Gunners' charts. Remember, Santa Claus will be here before Olivier Giroud returns from injury so we should be looking at a two-horse race - no disrespect to Aaron Ramsey.

You can also back Welbeck at 4/1 to score over 14 in the top flight this term, something an Arsenal player has managed in four of the last five seasons. Theo Walcott hit 14 in 2012/13.

Radamel Falcao is set to make his Manchester United debut against QPR on Sunday

Homes: Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United, Nottingham Forest, Reading

Aways: Wolves, Hearts, Fleetwood, Wimbledon

Draws: Arsenal vs Man City, Crystal Palace vs Burnley, St Johnstone vs Dundee

Manchester City provide the opposition for Arsenal on Saturday and Welbeck has a less than impressive record against them - scoring one goal (in an FA Cup tie) in eight games during his Red Devils days and drawing a blank in two appearances as a Sunderland player.

He's 9/4 with several firms for a debut goal against the champions, widely available at 7/1 for the opener and 5/1 to score in a home win.

Back up in Manchester, there was a familiar theme to the press conference as Falcao was officially unveiled as a United player.

He spoke about his 'dream move', naturally, and hailed the 'biggest club in the world' with 'great players' blah, blah blah.

Louis van Gaal has to keep Radamel Falcao, Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie happy at Manchester United

Less predictable is how Old Trafford boss Louis van Gaal will accommodate Falcao, Wayne Rooney, Robin van Persie and the rest of the new recruits.

Falcao and Rooney are 7/4 with a few firms to score most Premier League goals for United while the 2/1 with Paddy Power and Bet365 is the best you'll get for Van Persie.

Falcao and Co face QPR on Sunday and the Colombian is 3/1 in most places to score first and 4/1 with several firms for two or more.

Diego Costa started the season behind Van Persie, Sergio Aguero and Daniel Sturridge in the betting for Premier League top scorer but he's top of the tree (9/4) now after four goals in three games for Chelsea. Falcao is available at 14/1 and Welbeck is 33s. For the full list of top goalscorer odds from our betting partner Coral, CLICK HERE.

The runners and riders in this race can't afford to let Costa get too far in front - although Luis Suarez reeled them after starting last season with a suspension - and if you fancy a fast start from the United and Arsenal men it's slightly better than 4/1 that Falcao and Welbeck score at any time this weekend.

Mario Balotelli played an hour for Liverpool at Spurs but he's set for his home debut against Aston Villa on Saturday night. Stick the controversial Italian in with Welbeck and Falcao and the anytime treble returns around 9/1.

Chelsea striker Diego Costa is the early leader in the race to score most Premier League goals this season

The Premier League is back with a bang - Arsenal vs Manchester City is a belter to kick off the weekend and should be first on any both-teams-to-score line. Liverpool against Aston Villa has the makings of another telly treat with both sides hitting the net, while adding in Dundee United against Hamilton, Swindon's trip to Bradford and Southend's home clash with Portsmouth returns around 16/1 with Coral if all 10 teams score.
