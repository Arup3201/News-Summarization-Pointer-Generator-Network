It appears Sam Burgess body clock hasn't quite adjusted to UK time yet after flying from Sydney. The 25-year-old tweeted at 5:33am on Thursday: 

'I'm Up bright and early this morning. Big day coming up at @BathRugby... Can't wait. But first, I've got to find some coffee. Where you at?' 

Sam Burgess fears it could be 'a couple of months' before he makes his union debut but  is eager to win the respect of his team-mates after officially being unveiled as a Bath player.

The 25-year-old cross-code convert posed for pictures and met his new team-mates on Thursday, having flown to Bath on Tuesday after saying goodbye to girlfriend Phoebe Hookeat and older brother Luke at Sydney Airport.

Burgess agreed a three-year deal with Bath in February and will be hoping to play for England at the 2015 World Cup.

Burgess left rugby league on a winning note after putting in a man-of-the-match performance as South Sydney Rabbitohs beat Canterbury Bulldogs 30-6 in the NRL Grand Final.

It was the Rabbitohs' first title in 43 years and Burgess also claimed the international rugby league player of the year award.

However, he fractured his cheekbone in the first minute of the game and will not rush to make his first appearance for Bath - despite the enormous weight of expectation on his shoulders.

He said: 'We haven’t put a date on or put any pressure on ourselves. The surgeon said to be smart and take my time. I’ll work hard with the medical staff.

‘It’s probably a bit of a blessing that I can see the game at ground level before jumping in at the deep end. I honestly don’t have a ball park at all. It could improve drastically or take a while.

‘We’ll see how I go in training. It could take a couple of weeks or even a couple of months.’

There will be a lot for Burgess to adapt to in the coming weeks - including, it seems, a new time zone.

It's clear he hasn't recovered from the jet lag yet after he tweeted in the early hours of Thursday morning about his excitement at moving to Bath.

'I'm Up bright and early this morning. Big day coming up at @BathRugby... Can't wait. But first, I've got to find some coffee. Where you at?' he wrote, before later uploading a picture to Instagram as he waited to be unveiled to the media.

Burgess also admitted his knowledge of rugby union is limited after growing up playing the opposite code for Bradford Bulls and then the Rabbitohs.

‘I didn’t watch a great deal of union growing up,’ he said. ‘Everyone’s familiar with the 2003 World Cup. Mike (Ford) has sent across a lot of footage but I’ve only watched from a distance. It’s really important to earn the respect of my team-mates.’ 

Bath coach Mike Ford played a key role in signing Burgess and was keen to stress he will not be forced into action too early.  

He said: 'The injury is a blessing. He can learn the game without any pressure of when he’ll play or where he’ll play. He’ll play when he is ready. We just don’t know when that will be. He’ll play when he’s ready. We just don’t know. The guy has a pretty beat up cheekbone. The last thing I want to do is play him too early.’ 

Burgess added: 'It is just sinking in. I have only been here just over 24 hours. The club and the staff are fantastic, and I am really looking forward to meeting the team. So far, it has been a cracking experience.

'Being in a team environment is one of the most powerful things. I am not getting carried away with anything. I understand it is going to take a lot of hard work and a lot of commitment to achieve what I want.

The former Bradford Bulls loose forward was lured to Bath by the prospect of following in the footsteps of Jason Robinson - the only Englishman to switch codes and win the union World Cup.

'It is always nice to talk with people who have been in your situation before. I have spoken to Faz (Andy Farrell) a couple of times, but nothing in depth. With the NRL competition in Australia, I was very much into that and didn't want any distractions,' he added.

'Jason (Robinson) has been in touch, and I am sure we will sit down and have a chat. These guys are successful people.'

Bath have yet to reveal where they see Burgess fitting into their team, with back-row and midfield as possible options. There is already talk of an England call-up.

'A few areas (positions) have been thrown around,' he said. 'If I am quite honest, I don't know where I am best suited. Over time, I think that will become clear.

'Nothing is set in stone, and there is no pressure on myself from Mike to do anything. I am just going to get in there, knuckle down and do my best.

'It (England selection) is something I have no control over. There are always going to be outside influences that have their opinion. That's part of the game, part of the sport and part of the challenge to ignore what is going on.

'In rugby league in Australia you are scrutinised in fine detail, so I have learnt a lot in five years over there. Hopefully, I can bring that here with me into my new career at Bath.' 

Sam Burgess' switch from rugby league to union makes him the latest player to move between the two sports. Here Sportsmail looks at some other converts who have gone on to represent England in the past.

Jason Robinson

Joined Sale Sharks from Wigan in 2000. Part of the Lions tour of Australia in 2001 and won the World Cup with England two years later. Scored a total of 28 tries in 51 caps. Arguably England's greatest-ever convert.

Chris Ashton

Switched codes in 2007 leaving Wigan Warriors for Northampton Saints. Has scored 19 tries in 39 caps for England to date.

Kyle Eastmond

Left St Helens for Bath in 2011 and has won four caps for England so far.

Stephen Myler

Joined Northampton in 2006 from Salford City Reds. Has made one England appearance but is in the squad for the autumn internationals.

Andy Farrell

Left Wigan for Saracens in 2005 but had a injury-plagued career in union. Featured in the 2007 World Cup and won eight caps for his country.

Like Farrell, Tomkins followed the same route in 2011 before returning to Wigan in June. He won three caps for England as he struggled to adjust to the 15-a-side game.

Shontayne Hape

Joined Bath in 2008 from Bradford Bulls and started at inside centre for England at the 2011 World Cup. The former New Zealand rugby league international scored two tries in 13 appearances for his adopted country.

Lesley Vanikolo
