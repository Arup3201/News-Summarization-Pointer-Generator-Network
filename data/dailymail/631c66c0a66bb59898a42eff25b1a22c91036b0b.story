The UK TV rights for the Floyd Mayweather – Manny Pacquiao fight to be decided within the week are boiling down to a £12m battle between Sky and specialist boxing channel BoxNation, who have covered both boxers’ fights in recent years and would structure the deal in a different way to Sky.

Mayweather, as in every other detail around this event, will have the final say. 

American cable networks Showtime and HBO are preparing to charge a record $99.95 (£65) for a pay-per-view subscription to watch the fight.

With the combined purse for Mayweather and Pacquiao totalling at least $250million, projections for the value of the event are rising from an initial $300m to close on half a billion. 

Come May 2, all the MGM properties will screen closed-circuit transmission on giants screens with entrance fees reaching $200 (£130) plus.

Millions in the Philippines will also watch on giant screens in city squares and parks. 

The MGM sold out all its 5,005 rooms within 15 minutes of Mayweather firing the starting gun online. The base room rate for the nights of May 1 and 2 is upward of $500. 

Tickets for ringside seats, expected face value $5,000 (£3,300), are already appearing on the black market at up to $20,000 (£13,000).
