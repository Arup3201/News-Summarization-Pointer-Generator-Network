From the exuberance of a community festival at a mud mosque in Mali to the solitude of life ‘off the grid’ in Wales, taking in both sweeping landscapes and the minutiae of an ant colony, these stunning images have been named the winners of a world-renowned photography competition.

The winners of the Travel Photographer Of The Year awards, which were announced today, give both armchair travellers and seasoned explorers a glimpse of the magnificence, beauty and poignancy of this planet and its inhabitants. 

This vibrant, entertaining and sometimes thought-provoking selection, taking in both places that many of us will never travel to and familiar destinations, were captured by the hugely talented amateur and professional photographers who beat entrants from nearly 100 countries.

Winner: Photographer Timothy Allen won the top prize, the Cutty Sark Award for the Travel Photographer of the Year 2013, for his portfolio which included this black and white image of the mud mosque replastering festival in Mali

Prized: British photographer Mr Allen also took this image depicting a young Layap woman pouring butter tea in her house in Laya, North West Bhutan

Off grid: Emma Orbach, who lives in a mud hut at Tir Ysbrydol in West Wales, was photographed by competition-winner Timothy Allen

The top prize – the Cutty Sark Award for the Travel Photographer of the 
Year 2013 – was awarded to British photographer Timothy Allen for his 
black and white images of the mud mosque replastering festival and Dogon
 life in Mali, and his studies of individuals in Wales and Bhutan.

A long-time TPOTY entrant, who has been a category winner on a number
 of occasions, Mr Allen has now scooped the contest’s highest award, 
winning £5,000 plus a complete set of Cutty Sark's whiskies and bespoke,
 personalised Cutty Sark/TPOTY surfboard.

'As Timothy is both a whisky fan and a surfer, the prize is sure to be put to good use', said a spokesman for the awards.

Young talent: Jonathan Rystrøm, 14, from Denmark was also celebrating after he was named Young Travel Photographer of the Year 2013, having stunned judges with his photograph taken in front of the Rector's Palace in Dubrovnik, Croatia

Human nature: This photograph of human towers being built at a festival in Catalonia, Spain was taken by David Oliete and was highly commended by competition judges

Dramatic: US photographer Justin Mott took home the One Shot, Extraordinary prize for this image taken in Phuket, Thailand

Landscape: French photographer Emmanuel Coupe was behind this stunning shot of the Gullfoss waterfall in Iceland

Jonathan Rystrøm from Denmark was also celebrating after he was named Young Travel Photographer of the Year 2013.

The
 14-year-old, who got into photography when his grandfather took 
him on a safari trip, stunned judges with his photograph of a woman 
using her mobile phone in front of the Rector's Palace in Dubrovnik, 
Croatia.

'Jonathan's
 willingness to experiment with movement and to use this well in his 
compositions is particularly impressive for one so young,' said the competition judges.

Leap of faith: British photographer Cat Vinton was commended for this image of a sea gypsy spear fishing on the Andaman Sea

Out hunting: Ed Hetherington caught these lionesses on camera as they hunted for food on Chief's Island in the Okavango Delta, Botswana

Beastly: Mr Hetherington also caught the moment the lionesses pounced on their prey

'At just 14 years old, he is third youngest photographer to win the award of Young 
Travel Photographer of the Year and only the second ever Danish winner 
of any category in the awards, following in the footsteps on Student 
award winner, Sophie Tondering, in 2003.

'If Jonathan continues to
 develop his keen eye and willingness to experiment with his photography
 then he has a bright future ahead of him.'

The 14 and under category was won by 10-year-old Patria Prasaysa from Indonesia, while 17-year-old Chase Guttman from the USA won the 15-18 age group.

Tender moment: This unusual image of a gorilla was taken in the Virunga Mountains of Rwanda by Swiss photographer Gail Von Bergen-Ryan

All smiles: British-born photographer Gavin Gough won a prize for his portfolio with the help of this shot of a boy leaping through the open window of a derelict building in Kolkata, India

At rest: This photograph of an eagle hunter and his eagle at rest at home in the Alti region of western Mongolian was named runner-up in the Vanishing & Emerging Cultures category

Race to the finish: Camels ridden by robotic jockeys race to the finish line to the joy of the watching crowd in this picture taken by Jason Edwards

In the portfolio sections, Jino Lee from Singapre won the Monochromal category, while the British-born Thailand-based photographer Gavin Gough took the top spot in Vanishing & Emerging cultures. Jasper Doest from the Netherlands, and Johnny Haglund from Norway shared top honours in Wild Stories with two sharply contrasting portfolios; one beautiful, the other gritty.

The New Talent award went to British medical student Tom Pepper, with the Vietnam-based American Justin Mott capturing the top prize in the single image category, Extraordinary.

There were two winners in the beginner’s category En Route – Merissa Quek  from Singapore and Stuart Draper from the UK, while another British-based photographer James Morgan repeated his 2012 success in the short film category Travel Shorts by finishing on top in 2013.

The awards were judged by a hugely respected international panel of imaging experts, including photographers Eamonn McCabe, Nick Meers and Chris Weston, the editor of the German magazine FOTO and the photography director of Condé Nast Traveller.

The winning images and films can be seen on www.tpoty.com and will be displayed at a major exhibition at London’s Royal Geographical Society from July 11 until August 17 next year. The exhibition there in 2013 attracted almost 50,000 visitors.
