A father who endured a savage grizzly bear attack in Montana in 2005 and lived to tell the tale is speaking out about his horrific experience 10 years later.

'We are both extremely lucky,' Johan Otter told 10News.com. 'There's no bigger jackpot, basically.'

Now fully healed, Otter and his daughter Jenna are the subjects of an episode of ABC's In an Instant, which dramatizes the events as they unfolded on a trail at Glacier National Park.

The bear seemed to come out of nowhere, Otter recalled, along with her two cubs.

Lucky: Johan Otter was savagely mauled by a bear in Montana ten years ago and is now speaking out about the harrowing tale

'She could have touched it -- basically that close,' Otter says of his daughter. 'So she stepped back real fast and just naturally, as a parent, you step in front of your kid.'

'The worst fear of a parent is to hear your child scream,' a tearful Otter told In an Instant.

That's when the mama bear attacked, tearing off nearly 80 percent of Otter's scalp, breaking his neck and gouging his right eye.

'All I see is claws and teeth,' Otter said. 

'The bear kind of goes like this on it, basically digging for a bone, which is your skull and biting on it like this.'

Despite the massive wounds, Otter says he remained standing and in a in instant decided the only way to survive was to leap off the mountain. 

His daughter, who also sustained life threatening injuries, eventually did the same and the two ended up on the same mountain ledge. But not before the bear turned its attention to Jenna.

'The bear stood over me and it put one paw on either side of my head,' Jenna recalled. 'The bear took my head in its mouth. Its lower jaw was kind of around my jaw. It's upper jaw was around the back of my head.

'When it bit me, I didn't feel pain, just pressure,' she said.

Thinking fast, Jenna played dead and the bear wandered off. The immediate danger was gone, but the looming threat of their massive injuries remained. 

Jenna began to scream for help and soon some passing hikers were able to call for help. Unfortunately, the mother and father could not be pulled from the mountain for another three hours.

An arduous recovery followed for Otter, but the Escondido, California man prevailed. According to UTSanDiego.com, he's even managed to run the Boston Marathon six times since the ordeal. 

The attack occurred on a remote trail, which made the subsequent rescue painfully difficult

Otter's daughter Jenna has also fully recovered and is now in her fourth year of medical school at prestigious Columbia University.

She recalled to ABC what she was thinking during the terrifying ordeal.

'I just thought that we would die, it's too bad that I'm not going to live past 18,' she recalls thinking.

Thankfully, and miraculously, Jenna was wrong. She's now working towards becoming an emergency room physician.

And while her father still has residual PTSD from the attack, the family continues to hike the same area where he was nearly killed.

'We're already planning what kind of trail we're going to do when we're 80, so we'll see,' Otter told 10 News.
