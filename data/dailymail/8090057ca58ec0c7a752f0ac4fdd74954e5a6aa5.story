The agent of Javier Pastore insists the Argentinian playmaker will remain at Paris St Germain despite recent reports linking him with a move to Juventus this summer.

The Italian media claim Pastore is the No 1 target of the Serie A champions, with new Juve coach Massimiliano Allegri keen to acquire the 25-year-old's services.

'Is Juventus interested in Pastore? No one has called me but I can confirm that Pastore will remain at PSG,' Pastore's agent Marcelo Simonian said to www.tuttomercatoweb.com.

Pastore joined PSG from Palermo in 2011 in a £32million transfer deal.

The South American player, who was also a reported target of top Premier League clubs this summer, is under contract with the Ligue 1 giants until June 2016.
