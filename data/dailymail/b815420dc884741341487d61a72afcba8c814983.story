Residents in a Cornish village fear their cars may have been ‘possessed’ after vehicles started mysteriously locking and unlocking themselves.

People living in Summercourt, near Newquay, have reported door locks bizarrely activating on their own – on one occasion trapping a frightened child inside.

Baffled motorists claim dozens of cars in the village have been 'possessed' and have dubbed the area the 'Summercourt Triangle' - named after the famous Bermuda Triangle where a number of aircraft and ships are said to have disappeared under strange circumstances.

Lin Howard, who has been affected, said residents have changed key fob batteries but the problem, which started six months ago, has remained.

She said: ‘Another driver has not been able to start their car.

‘They have to go home, get back to school, get someone to look at the car, then after a period of time it starts again.’

Resident Wendy Malham said: ‘I got in the car to drive to school and the locks were going on-off, on-off, like it was possessed.

‘I can’t actually lock my car anymore because the alarms go off.’

Kelvin Malham added: ‘We went to Andover where we didn’t have a problem, but when we returned it started again.’

Expert Mike Parris from car technology consultancy firm SBD said the most likely cause was accidental radio interference adding that it was ‘not unheard of’.

He said it could be caused by “almost anything that is wireless”, such as alarm systems, temperature gauges, weather stations or walkie-talkies.

‘Residents could try and keep a log of when they have difficulties, the locations which are worse and anything which helps to pinpoint it.

‘These things are notoriously difficult to pin down,’ he added.
