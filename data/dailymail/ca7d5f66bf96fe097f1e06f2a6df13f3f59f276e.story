Jose Riga has been handed a route straight back into management by Blackpool as the club finalised a deal for the Belgian to become their new boss.

The 56-year-old left Charlton Athletic at the end of last season after just two months in charge and has succeeded Paul Ince at Bloomfield Road.

Riga held talks with the Seasiders over the weekend and chairman Karl Oyston was impressed enough to offer him the job following months of stagnation without a permanent manager, as revealed by Sportsmail on Monday.

Riga was heralded for keeping the Addicks in the Championship during his brief spell in charge at the Valley and has further coaching experience with Standard Liege and AC Milan.

Former Leeds boss Brian McDermott was also interviewed for the post, while Blackpool performed a U-turn in appointing Brian Flynn last week.

The job does represent a massive task for Riga.

Under caretaker manager Barry Ferguson the North West side narrowly avoided relegation down into League One in the final weeks of last season and have only six contracted players on their books.

Riga is believed to have already drawn up a lengthy list of potential new players as the club look to press ahead before the start of pre-season next month.

The club are expected to announce the deal next weekend with Riga set to sign a one-year rolling contract.
