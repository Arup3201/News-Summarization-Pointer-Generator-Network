A senior judge has condemned pre-nuptial agreements claiming that the only reason people want them is to give their partner less than they are entitled to in the event of a marital breakthrough.

Baroness Hale of Richmond was commenting after one leading family law firm said that the demand for such documents has increased by 50 per cent. 

The Law Reform Commission also recommended back in February that pre-nuptial agreements should be made legally binding in English courts.

Justice secretary Chris Grayling has already commented that implementing such agreements is a sensible proposition.

Baroness Hale said: 'I am very suspicious of prenuptial agreements' as they are designed 'almost always to give someone less than they would be otherwise entitled to'. 

Charlotte Leyson, family solicitor at Hughes James told The Times: 'Prenups are no longer just used by oligarchs or celebrities looking to protect vast wealth. Since the publicity around the Law Commission's recommendations, people have more confidence that a pre-nuptial agreement could be taken seriously by the courts.

'Younger people in particular are becoming more pragmatic about prenups. It is not about a lack of trust or an expectation that the marriage will fail - they recognise that by thinking ahead about what financial responsibilities they would face in the event of a divorce, they can  reduce the possibility of an acrimonious and expensive break-up in the future. 

'Anyone who has assets to protect is starting to view the prenup as a sensible precaution, a bit like making a will.' 

Earlier this year when the prenuptial agreement proposals were published, Professor Elizabeth Cooke, Law Commissioner for property, family and trust law, said: 'Pre- and post-nuptial agreements are becoming more commonplace but the courts will not always follow them and lawyers are therefore not able to give clear advice about their effect.

'The measures we are recommending would help couples understand and meet their financial responsibilities and, where appropriate, achieve financial independence.'
