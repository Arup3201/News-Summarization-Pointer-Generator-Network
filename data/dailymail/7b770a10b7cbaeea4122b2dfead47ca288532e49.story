The five weeks building up to polling day, held on September 18, had seen 10 million interactions take place on the social network as the Yes and No campaigns battled for a win.

The ice bucket challenge, where brave fundraisers allowed friends and family to tip a bucket of ice water over their heads in aid of the fight against motor neurone disease, came in as the second most popular topic in the country.

This was in line with global interests, as the phenomenon saw 17 million videos shared worldwide, according to Facebook's annual year in review.

Football is never far from many Britons’ thoughts, so it is no surprise that the sport dominated the top 10.

The World Cup was the third most popular topic - possibly due to exasperation over England’s woeful efforts - while the Premier League title race that saw Manchester City pip Liverpool was fourth.

The other two most popular soccer stories discussed on Facebook were Louis van Gaal’s appointment as Manchester United boss (seventh) and the all-Spanish Champions League final between Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid (ninth).

The conflict in Gaza was the fifth most popular topic for interactions, while the death of actor Robin Williams in August was sixth.

The outbreak of the Ebola virus ranked number eight for interactions, while the First World War centenary was tenth.
