A former corrections officer has been arrested after he allegedly allowed a pair of exotic dancers to smuggle in contraband and have romantic relationships with prisoners under his watch.

Randolph Blackwelder, 45, who resigned from Sumter Correctional Facility in Bushnell, Florida, has been charged with official misconduct after Jason Adams walked away from a five-man roadside work detail in September.

Adams left the labor unit on State Road 54 in Lutz, Florida, and was discovered at a Tampa Greyhound bus station the next day. Blackwelder allegedly delayed his call to the sheriff's office alerting them to the escape to give Adams time to get away.

Investigators say Blackwelder was in on the escape and 'basically allowed it [the unit] to be a party' by letting inmates have conjugal visits and leave whenever they wanted so they could get hold of alcohol and cigarettes.

During their investigation, police discovered that the contraband was being carried inside the prisoner's rectums or had been packed into Scooby Snax spice packs. 

Exotic dancer Ann Petty, 46, who would give them contraband while they were under Blackwelder's supervision, is said to have been 'romantically involved' with several prisoners. 

Jessica Hope Morgan, 25, another part of the suspected smuggling ring, told officers she knew what she was doing was wrong, but carried on because she had 'fallen in love' with one of the inmates.

The pair are being held accused of smuggling contraband into a state correctional facility. 

Blackwelder was also charged with official misconduct, unlawful compensation for official behavior and smuggling contraband into a state correctional facility. 

Pasco Sheriff Chris Nocco said that the group had been 'more play than work' - enjoying conjugal visits and beer drinking sessions in the woods. 

He told the Tampa Bay Times: 'Prison is supposed to be tough. He [Blackwelder] was allowing it to be basically a party out there.

Club: Petty and Morgan both worked at Calender Girls in Hudson, Florida. Morgan told investigators she knew what she was doing but carried on because she had 'fallen in love' with one of the prisoners 

According to the Tampa Bay Times, Blackwelder several hours to tell anyone after Adams walked off. While he let the illicit operation continue under his watch, he reportedly received food, alcohol, tobacco and cash payments. 

Nocco added: 'We know when they went off, they were doing other things in the field. This guy was clearly not doing his job and was putting the safety of our citizens at risk.'

Detective David Boyer said the seized contraband 'only scratches the surface' of what inmates had access to.

He said: 'This stuff is unacceptable. You put this contraband in the hands of convicted felons that are sentenced to the Department of Corrections for serious, serious charges - attempted murder on law enforcement, attempted murder, serious theft and violent crimes - it's scary.'

Blackwelder is being held on $40,000 bail. 

It was the second time that Adams had escaped in two weeks. The first time he visited a nearby gas station and bought four cans of beer and cigarettes - all of which he is believed to have planned to sell in prison.  

Access: Blackwelder, who used to work at the Sumter Correctional Institution in Florida, is suspected of letting inmates walk away whenever they wanted in return for food, tobacco, alcohol and cash
