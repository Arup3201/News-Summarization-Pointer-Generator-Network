Crash: Laura Martin, 28, has apologized for hitting two little girls with her SUV, but promises she was not drunk

A mother has apologized from behind bars for hitting two little girls with her SUV, but is insisting she was not drunk.

Laura Martin, 28, crashed into the pair at around 9:45 a.m on Saturday as the girls were walking on the sidewalk in Fort Worth, Dallas.

Witnesses told the Fort Worth Fire Department that the female driver of the Ford Expedition hit one or more vehicles on a neighborhood street, then turned on the wrong side of the four-lane, divided road.

She knocked down a tree and a school zone signal light as well as hitting the pair before stopping after crashing through a brick wall. 

One of the girls was airlifted to Cook Children's Medical Center in critical condition with two broken legs, according to authorities.

Martin was transported to John Peter Smith Hospital with neck and back injuries and arrested after she was released.

The mother-of-three was charged with intoxication assault

'There's not a good way to say 'I'm sorry enough,'' Martin told NBC 5 from the Mansfield City Jail Monday night.

'I can never make it right. I'm just so sorry.'

Martin insists she not drunk and had not taken drugs - she says blood samples taken after the accident will prove it. 

She said the morning of the accident she left her mother's house following an argument.

'I jumped in the car and we were yelling and screaming at each other and I took off,' she said.

Scene: Martin was driving an SUV the wrong way down a street in Fort Worth, Texas, when she struck two girls and then crashed into a brick wall near a home

Horror: Witnesses said the SUV had hit at least one vehicle on a neighborhood street, and knocked down a tree and a school zone signal light

'I was not paying attention like I should have been, I should not have been fighting, and I know I was going too fast.'

She said she lost control of her car when she reached for a water bottle and knocked it over. 

Martin's bond is set at $10,000.
