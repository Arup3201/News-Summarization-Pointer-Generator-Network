Just days after the Prime Minister met with world leaders at the G20 summit in Brisbane, the latest polls reveal Tony Abbott has dropped in popularity.

Federal Labor has recorded its best Newspoll result in nine months, with the opposition opening up a 10-point lead over the coalition after preferences.

According to the Newspoll, conducted for News Corp last weekend, Tony Abbott suffered a fall in satisfaction with opposition leader Bill Shorten again the nation's preferred prime minister.

This follows Mr Abbott's embarrassing gaffe on Monday night where he confused China with Tasmania while toasting Chinese President Xi Jinping at a special dinner at parliament house.

Mr Abbott was summing up the day's developments after the two nations reached agreement on a free trade deal and a speech by Mr Xi to parliament, when he appeared to confuse the island state with the Asian nation.

'To mark President Xi's visit, Australia and Tasmania and, and - we've said a lot about Tasmania - Australia and China have reached agreements,' Mr Abbott said.

'It's hard to confuse Tasmania and China - but I have,' Mr Abbott said, jokingly shrugging off the error. 

Newspoll results showed the Abbott government's primary vote dropped to a four-month low of 36 per cent, while Labor's primary support was at 39 per cent.

Support for the Greens dropped two points to 11 per cent, while minor parties, independents and others were collectively up one point to 14 per cent.

In two-party-preferred terms, based on preference flows from last year's election, Labor leads 55 per cent to 45 per cent.

On Tuesday morning it was revealed that opposition leader Bill Shorten (pictured) has taken a 10-point lead over the coalition

Last week, Mr Abbott met with world leaders at the G20 summit which was held in Brisbane.

Following its conclusion, President Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan were welcomed at Government House in Canberra to sign a ground breaking trade deal which will eventually see 95 per cent of Australian exports enter China tariff-free.

On Monday night, Mr Abbott took the opportunity to praise the Chinese president's 'remarkable' speech in parliament during the day.

Never had he heard a Chinese leader declare that his country would be fully democratic by 2050.

'When I listened to the president today, some of the shadows over our region and over our world lifted and the sun did indeed shine brightly,' Mr Abbott said, citing an Australian proverb.

'I thank you, Mr President, for this historic, historic statement which I hope will echo right around the world.'

Mr Xi returned the love, saying he's felt right at home on his latest visit.

China stood as one of Australia's best friends in the region - but the key to maintaining that was with 'political trust'.

'We need to put one's self into the other's shoes and look at each other's intention from the other side's standpoint of view,' Mr Xi said.

President Xi is due to visit Hobart on Tuesday, after which he will have been to every Australian state and territory.
