The Chicago-area home where Ferris Bueller's friend Cameron famously 'killed' his father's prized Ferrari finally has a new owner.

The 5,300-square-foot house in Highland Park, Chicago, Illinois, sold on Thursday for $1.06 million after five years on the market and several mark-downs.

It featured in the iconic 1986 film, starring Matthew Broderick as Ferris Bueller, as the home of Bueller's neurotic best friend Cameron Frye, played by Alan Ruck.

No movie magic: The house failed to sell for the original price of $2.3 million in 2008. It went back on sale for $1.5 million in 2011 and finally sold for $1.06 million Thursday

Craig Hogan is regional director at Coldwell Banker Previews. He wouldn't say who bought the four-bedroom, steel-and-glass house built on the edge of a wooded ravine.

However, Hogan did say that the buyers bought the property, not because of its Hollywood past, but because they love the building.

'At the end of the day, what sold the house was not the notoriety of the property but the architecture. We sold it to a couple who are architecture buffs who want to restore it. Believe me, it was not connected to the movie,' he told Crain's Chicago Business.

Modern: The glass pavilion was designed to house a collection of four vintage cars

The house, built in 1953 by Mies van der Rohe-protege A. James Speyer, was first put on the market in 2009 listed at $2.3 million.

The sleek house featured in a pivotal scene in John Hughes' classic 1986 film Ferris Bueller's Day Off.

Frye has a 
breakdown in the garage after returning his father's beloved Ferrari but 
discovering that hundreds of miles have been added to its speedometer.

He then kicks the car repeatedly before sending it crashing through the glass walls into the ravine below.

Custom-built: The unique home boasts four bedrooms and the pavilion was added 20 years after it was built

Pedigree: The home, which sits on stilts over a ravine, was designed by A. James Speyer, who was mentored by pioneering architect Ludwig Mies Van Der Roche

After the Ferrari crashes through the glass into the ravine, Bueller tells Frye: 'You killed the car.'

The home is on the market for the second time in two years after the owners failed to sell at $1.65 million in 2011.

The owners originally put the home on 
the market for $2.3million in 2009 but it did not sell and has since 
undergone a renovation. 

It was built in 1953 by architect A. James Speyer, who was mentored by pioneering architect Ludwig Mies Van Der Roche.

The glass-enclosed garage, designed by David Haid, was added 20 years later to store a collection of vintage cars.

The four-bedroom home has only had one family of owners, according to the Chicago Tribune.
