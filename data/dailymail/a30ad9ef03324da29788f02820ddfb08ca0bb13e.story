The mother of an autistic boy who was slashed in the neck in an unprovoked attack said her son is lucky to be alive.

Eamonn Finn, 16, was chased by three teenage boys and assaulted in Pimlico, central London, in June, leaving him so traumatised he still has nightmares six months later.

His mother Margaret Finn said she just wanted 'closure' for her son as police renew their appeal to catch the boys responsible for the attack.

Detectives want to speak to these three teenagers about the attack on Eamonn Finn,16, in Pimlico, central London

Ms Finn posted a picture of her son's neck wound on Facebook which has been shared nearly 200,000 times.

Speaking at Scotland Yard's headquarters in central London today, she said: 'I strongly believe someone does know who did this to my child. I would appeal to them to contact the police and do the right thing.

'He's still having dreams about the event. He says "I think about those boys a lot and what they did to me."

'It's really hard for me to talk about without getting emotional because there is no one who could invite this less than Eamonn. He's such an amazing young man and he deserves some closure and we don't have that at the moment.'

Ms Finn said she had 'real concerns' that if the culprits were not caught, another victim 'might not be as lucky'.

Scotland Yard has released CCTV footage of Eamonn being chased as he walked alone to a youth centre in Pimlico at around 7.20pm on June 4. Eammon is in the foreground

One of the attackers asked the boy what he was looking at before Eamonn ran away along Regency Street, close to the junction with Causton Street

He was then slashed across the neck with an unknown weapon and needed hospital treatment, police said

'He's lucky to be alive as far as I'm concerned,' she said.

'It's really impacted on his independence. Anyone who has a child with autism knows that's really hard fought for.

'In Eamonn's case that was two years in the making. That's gone now. We're having to start from scratch.'

Scotland Yard has released CCTV of Eamonn being chased as he walked alone to a youth centre in Pimlico at around 7.20pm on June 4.

One of the attackers asked the boy what he was looking at before Eamonn ran away along Regency Street, close to the junction with Causton Street.

He was then slashed across the neck with an unknown weapon and needed hospital treatment, police said.

Ms Finn said the gang were 'immediately abusive, confrontational and aggressive' which frightened her son before he ran away.

'He clearly didn't want trouble,' she said.

'He was running away and they chased him. That's what is so difficult. They pursued him.

'I don't think there's all bad in everyone. I hope there's a part of them that realises they did something wrong but they can do something right now.

'The person they did this to didn't deserve it. They have an opportunity now to take responsibility for their actions.'

Acting Detective Chief Inspector Dave Bolton said: 'The victim is a vulnerable young person and this was one of only a few times he has walked anywhere alone. For some unknown reason the three suspects have taken umbrage to him and attacked him with no provocation and no known reason.

'It is sheer luck that the weapon missed his artery and he was not more severely injured.

'Six months into this investigation we have undertaken extensive enquiries to identify the suspects and have followed various leads, but they remain unidentified at this time. I would like to appeal to the public for their help to identify these males.'

The suspects were described by the victim as black or Hispanic males. One was wearing a blue Adidas top and another was described as being around 16 years old.

Anyone with information is asked to call police or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
