Nigella Lawson has this week arrived in the U.S. to film the new season of The Taste - just months after being refused entry over a cocaine confession.

The curvaceous British TV chef, 54, happily told her 664,000 Twitter followers that she was en-route to America - as she posted pictures of the plentiful Coleman's mustard, Ty-Phoo tea bags and gourmet Maldon seat salt she had packed, writing: 'Stateside for a month now: essential supplies'.

MailOnline told in May that the ABC cooking show was returning - and that Nigella would be welcome back if she could sort her visa.

And mother-of-two Nigella this week promoted the fact that she was back, posting a drawing of her with fellow Taste co-stars Anthony Bourdain, Marcus Lefebvre and Martin Samuelsson.

Alongside this, this afternoon, French chef Marcus tweeted a picture of a celebratory crab feast he was whipping up for his chefs at his Californian home, telling them 'welcome to LA!'

‘Domestic Goddess’ Nigella was forced to 
confess under oath during a trial last year that she had snorted cocaine
 seven times and smoked cannabis in front of her children.

And in April the Daily Mail told how Nigella was stopped from boarding a flight from Heathrow to Los Angeles.

She
 is thought to have checked in and passed security before being told she
 could not board her plane. She had to return to the first class 
check-in to arrange to collect her hold luggage.

Nigella
 is thought to have tried to enter the U.S. by registering online for 
permission to travel and confirming she had not been arrested or 
convicted of offences including taking illegal drugs.

But the U.S. can 
also decide to bar foreigners who have committed drugs offences without 
ever being charged. Would-be travellers can apply to have the ban 
lifted, but this can take months.

Nigella was then invited by the U.S. Embassy in London to apply for a working visa - and could have faced a drug test by U.S. doctors.

At the time, her Taste co-star Anthony Bourdain today tweeted his support for the star, saying: 'I am absolutely mortified with embarrassment over the cruelty and hypocrisy of US actions re: #Nigella travel. Unbelievable.'

Season 2 of The Taste ended in February with 3.2 million viewers. And despite going up against NBC's Winter Olympics coverage, the show was up week to week by 7 per cent in total viewers - and up 14 per cent in women aged 18-34.

When Nigella 
made her return for season 2 of The Taste it was her big return to 
television screens following her very public divorce from Charles 
Saatchi.

Ludo went on to reveal how he had grown 'very, very, very close' with Nigella, describing the mom-of-two as a 'great woman'.

He said it 'broke my heart' to see his co-star's ordeal during the trial of her former housekeepers who were cleared of fraud in December.

In an interview with The London Times, Ludo described how he first saw Nigella on television when he moved to America in 1996, but they met for the first time last year.

The married chef, 42, said: 'We have become very, very, very close - we click right away.'

He went on to say seeing the court appearance 'broke my heart' before adding: 'Have you heard anything like this before? No. Because she is a great woman.'

His wife, lawyer Kristine Lefebvre, went on to say Nigella had described the chef as 'a very good-looking younger brother'.

Saucy: Nigella was certainly flirty when it came to winning over contestants on the show, who were hoping to be picked by the panel of chefs

On The Taste, the judges must decide whether they want the cook based solely on the taste.‘Food is never just food, it’s exquisite and it appeals to every sense,’ Nigella said. ‘It can change your life.’

Nigella had to give evidence at
 the trial of her former housekeepers, Francesca and Elisabetta Grillo, 
who were accused of stealing hundreds of thousands of pounds from her 
and ex-husband Charles Saatchi.

While insisting she had never been an addict or habitual user of drugs, she confirmed she had taken cocaine.

She
 said she needed the drugs to cope with the death of her first husband, 
John Diamond, and the ‘intimate terrorism’ of her second, Mr Saatchi.

A spokesman for Nigella was contacted for comment.
