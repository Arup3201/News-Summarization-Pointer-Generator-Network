The symmetry was almost cruel. A week that began with Jack Nicklaus’s prediction that Rory McIlroy could win ‘15 to 20 majors’ was ending with Tiger Woods limping out of yet another tournament.

While 36-hole leader McIlroy went about his weekend’s work at the USPGA Championship here with all the single-minded ruthlessness of a man who expected to win, the last incumbent to feel such empowerment was resigned to feeling all too mortal.

Who knows when we will next see Woods, destined perhaps to be stuck forever just outside the range of achievement that represented his lifetime goal, but it did not sound like it would be at the Ryder Cup or before the fall of autumn leaves.

In pain: The 14-time major champion has been a shadow of his former self as injuries interrupt his game

‘What this week has shown me is that I have to get stronger and I can’t do that playing tournament golf,’ he said. ‘You can’t burn the candle at both ends.’

One thing for certain is that Woods is done for this PGA Tour year, which ends in mid-September, having racked up statistics of such mind-numbing mediocrity that those of us who have followed him his entire career can feel merely sadness that it has come to this.

Here in the hometown of the Louisville Lip, we now know how boxing writers felt covering the last years of The Greatest.

Either side of missing four months of the season owing to back surgery, Woods played seven PGA Tour events, withdrawing twice, missing two halfway cuts, finishing no better than 25th and making a total £64,000. That is less than he made in each of 176 other events throughout his career.

In two majors, he racked up his worst 72-hole finish in a Grand Slam event at The Open and followed it by missing the halfway cut here by five shots, after two rounds of 74 left him 16 strokes behind McIlroy.

Pulling out: Azinger says he expects Woods to make Tom Watson's decision for him, but choosing not to play

Woods will not play in the Wyndham Championship this week and cannot play in the FedEx Cup play-offs that follow because he has not qualified, meaning that, if Ryder Cup captain Tom Watson picked him on September 2, it would be a gamble beyond reckless.

It would also be doing Woods no favours, for what we saw last week was pitiful. At 38, with his long list of injuries, fully fit is a goal that is simply unattainable. But he has to get to a point where he can swing the club free of pain before we see him again.

The only thing on his schedule is a lucrative exhibition date in Argentina at the end of October and that sounds a suitable timeframe to see if his body can heal to the point where it will allow him to resume his career.

Credit Woods for the way he conducted himself afterwards. He was clearly in considerable discomfort but did not duck his media duties, spending 15 minutes answering questions from the media.

When will we see you again? What will you be saying to Watson? How long will it take to get healthy? And so on. There were no particularly revealing answers because what can he say until he gets healthy? Forget any thoughts about 18 majors. That is the only goal the 14-time major winner should have now.

While Woods left the building, enter his natural successor riding the form of his life. How poetic that McIlroy should take 133 shots for his first two rounds, just as Tiger did in winning the PGA here in 2000.

McIlroy will try to add the Wanamaker Trophy today to the Claret Jug he won just three Sundays ago and make it four majors claimed from the last 15 played.

One major a year is the sort of ratio Nicklaus and Woods managed in their heyday, when they had little else to worry about but playing golf.

Even if he does not win on Sunday, it would not change anything for McIlroy. He knows the next five years are the ones where, if he is going to make it into double digits in majors, he has to do the damage.

There was enough going on in his second round on Friday to act as a wake-up call that number four was not a given. True, he shot 67, but he knew he would be lucky to do that again if his long game was as average.

Waiting to pounce: McIlroy may not win this week, but now is his time as Tiger's comes to an end

A good-looking leaderboard was also packed with fearless opponents. Australian Jason Day began just one behind, while Rickie Fowler was two adrift. Both will win majors at some point.

Henrik Stenson trailed by four. There were the doughty veterans Jim Furyk, Phil Mickelson and Lee Westwood, plus a couple of unsung Europeans in Bernd Wiesberger from Austria and perhaps Europe’s most underrated golfer, Finland’s Mikko Ilonen.

No wonder McIlroy was concentrating on the job at hand. ‘He obviously thinks I’m pretty good then,’ he said, grinning, when asked about Nicklaus’s majors remark.

‘I’m just trying to get to four and, when I do, I’ll try to get to five and so on. I don’t want to put a number on how many because if you say you want 15 and you ‘only’ win 10, does that mean you’ll feel disappointed?’

Let us enjoy the Rory era while we can. One look at Tiger emphasises the point that, even for the great ones, it does not last forever.
