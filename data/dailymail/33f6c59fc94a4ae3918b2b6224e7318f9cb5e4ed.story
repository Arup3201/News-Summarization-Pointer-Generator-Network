A couple used the 'caveman' diet to win a mammoth weight loss bet at 100-1 with bookmakers who paid out after they lost more than 10 stone.

Barry Penaluna, 32, staked £50 at 100-1 that he and girlfriend Helen Drinkall, 29, could lose a massive 10 stone in six months and they landed the bet to win £5,000 after a healthy eating and exercise regime saw the couple dropping from a combined 40st 12lbs to 30st 6lbs.

Bookmakers William Hill take about a 100 bets a year on weight loss, but no pair of gamblers have lost more than 10 stone before, so the couple have made punting history after being offered the longest ever odds.

Partners Barry Penaluna and Helen Drinkall put a bet on themselves to lose weight and won £5,000 from William Hill when they lost 10 stone between them

The pair, from Killingworth, Newcastle-Upon-Tyne, decided to lose the equivalent of a third person ahead of their marriage after civil servant Barry popped the question to Hull-born Helen last December.

Strapping 6ft tall Barry, who weighed 23st 3lbs when he placed the bet and now tips the scales at 17st 2lbs, said: 'I had tried diets and exercise in the past to lose weight, but it had never worked and at one point ahead of placing the bet I was up to 25 stone.

'Then I read a story about a man who won a bet with William Hill after losing a few stone and decided that we could do it and the £5,000 would be a great incentive and could go towards our wedding and a holiday.

'We've been together 10 years and it's easy just to get into a comfort zone. I was probably about 17st when we met and now I'd like to get down to 14st or even 13st. But it goes on a lot easier than it comes off. Once I put the bet on I wasn't going to lose it,'

Bookmakers William Hill, who accept around 100 bets on weightloss each year, offered the couple odds of 100-1 and paid out when Barry and Helen slimmed down

Barry added: 'I knew it was a big challenge, but with healthy eating and starting to take exercise I knew we could do it. We went on the caveman diet and cut out carbs and alcohol. I've just done the Great North 10k and a year ago I couldn't even run round the block.

'I go out running with my younger brother Jamie, 27, and he keeps telling me there is more in your legs, so I don't give up. I do a boot camp at the weekends and a cardiovascular work out session can see me burning 1,200 calories per hour.

'I've not had an alcoholic drink for four months and before this I'd have about 10 pints on a night out and a couple of bottles of white wine. 'I've got a season ticket at St James' Park and after the match I go for a Diet Coke now, but the lads all know about the weight loss and there's been no peer pressure to have a drink at all.

'I've won a few hundred on the football and the golf before, but this is my biggest ever win by a long way and the weight loss is priceless.'

The couple decided to change their lifestyle after getting engaged and will now put their winnings towards their wedding

Mother-of-two Helen, a fellow civil servant who hails from Hull, who went from 17st 9lbs to 13st 4lbs, said: 'I checked with the doctor that we were okay to take on the bet and we have changed our whole way of life with more exercise and healthy eating.

'Barry is the chef and he's put us both on the Paleo diet - or Caveman diet - where we don't eat carbs and have increased our exercise.

'We've grown together, but we now have two daughters Chloe, aged three, and 10-month-old Sophie and we don't want to be big unfit parents unable to play with our children.

'We got engaged before Christmas and then we struck the bet to get extra incentive for our wedding - I wasn't going to get married being overweight. We've tried lots of diets in the past, but striking that bet was the best incentive. When William Hill accepted our bet they changed our lives.'

William Hill's spokesman Rupert Adams said: 'This is a record-breaking first for William Hill as we've never had any couple land such a heavy-weight punt at 100-1 on their weight loss.

'When Helen called to say they had succeeded we were flabbergasted, this is an amazing achievement and they deserve their winnings.'

Breakfast: Nothing, instead would get to work and snack on a can of Coke (130 kcal) and a bag of crisps or some biscuits (200 kcal)

Lunch: A Dr Pepper (210 kcal), a sandwich (500 kcal) and another bag of crisps (200 kcal)

Mid afternoon snack: Chocolate bar (200 kcal) and another coke (130 kcal)

Evening meal: More Coke or other soft drinks, or wine and beer with a large pizza and chips or Chinese or Indian takeaway (around 2,500 kcal)

Alcohol at the weekends would boost their intake by anything between four or five thousand calories.

TOTAL: Around 4,000 calories per day

Breakfast: Strawberries, melon or banana (100 kcal each serving) and a glass of water.

Lunch: A grilled chicken salad (350 kcal) with water. Cutting out the soft drinks saved thousands of calories each week.

Evening meal: Healthy piece of chicken or fish with vegetables and perhaps a piece of fruit for dessert. Cooking the food himself ensured that Barry knew exactly what went into it and their evening meal was rarely more than 750 calories.

The couple cut out alcohol, white bread and processed food entirely and now snack on fruit, nuts and seeds and drink plenty of water.

TOTAL: Around 1,200 calories per day
