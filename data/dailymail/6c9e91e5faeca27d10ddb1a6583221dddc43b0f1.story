'Mexican waves' performed by prairie dogs have entertained many wildlife enthusiasts.

And now scientists believe they have finally solved the mystery of why the small burrowing rodents put on such a noisy and enthusiastic show that sees them throwing their paws in the air with a squeak.

Black-tailed prairies dogs use ‘jump-yip’ displays that resemble a Mexican wave to gauge how reliable their neighbours are at looking out for predators and to stop them being eaten, according to new research.

Black-tailed prairies dogs use 'jump-yip' displays (pictured) that resemble a Mexican wave to gauge how reliable their neighbours are at looking out for predators and to stop them being eaten. In the display, the rodents jolt upright, throw their heads back and paws up while making a 'wee-oo' sound

In the display, the rodents jolt upright, throw their heads back and paws up while making a ‘wee-oo’ sound.

Biologists at the University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, said the animals, which are native to the grasslands of North America, use the displays to work out how responsive their neighbours are to the threat of predators, such as crows, hawks and coyotes.

The burrowing rodents create mounds (pictured) which they use as look-out posts. Scientists had thought that the 'jump-yip' display was an elaborate 'all clear' signal, but Professor Hare and his colleagues noticed that the animals still made the noise when there were potential predators around

Professor James Hare from the department 
of biological sciences at the university, said the animals are 
effectively testing the levels of vigilance of their colony and adjust 
their behaviour according to how much they can rely on their neighbours’
 awareness of potential predators in their environment.

The displays are contagious, resulting in a ripple of 'jump-yip' movements

He also said the displays are contagious, resulting in a ripple of ‘jump-yip’ movements.

‘This fits beautifully with work on primates, including humans, which suggests that contagious displays – like yawning – provide a window into the mind of others, suggesting of course, that species probing the minds of others are aware that they are distinct from those individuals. That is to say, they are consciously aware,’ Professor Hare said.

‘Prairie dogs foraged less when individuals were less responsive to their jump-yip display, suggesting they use jump-yips to actively probe the awareness of their neighbours,’ he added.

Before this study, published in Proceedings of the Royal Society B, scientists had thought that the display was an elaborate ‘all clear’ signal, to tell a colony it is safe from predators.

But Professor Hare and his colleagues noticed that the animals still made the noise when there were potential predators around.

Now the team’s research claims to have resolved decades of speculation as to what function these unique visual and auditory displays serve among prairie dogs.

The findings suggest another way that sociality allows animals to forage effectively in the face of high predation risk, taking into account not only the number of individuals above ground within their social group, but their current state of awareness, Professor Hare explained.
