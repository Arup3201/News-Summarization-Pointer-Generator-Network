Spain may have to revert to playing without a striker against Chile after their shocking opening game defeat against Holland last week.

Here, Sportsmail's Martin Keown talks tactics and explains the selection problems Vicente del Bosque faces ahead of Wednesday's clash. 

Could Spain revert to playing with no striker?

The hardest thing for Spain on Wednesday is recovering from the mental scars of that defeat to Holland. Vicente del Bosque won’t have to make huge tactical changes but after Diego Costa’s poor show, he could bring in Cesc Fabregas as a ‘false nine’. He knows the role well and defenders don’t like marking empty spaces.

Not good enough: Diego Costa could drop to the bench after a poo display against Holland

Key man

Sergio Ramos was an inspiration for Real Madrid at the end of the season, always popping up with a decisive tackle or goal. He has to stand up now and drag everyone with him.

Torres over Costa?

If Spain stick with a striker, wouldn’t it be ironic if Fernando Torres ends up upstaging his soon-to-be Chelsea team-mate Costa?
