AB de Villiers was 84 not out as South Africa reached 313 for five wickets at lunch after losing captain Hashim Amla and some of their momentum early on the third day of the third and final test against West Indies on Sunday.

Amla and De Villiers had resumed on 227 for three at Newlands and showed early intent in their bid to accelerate the chase of West Indies' first innings tally of 329.

But the tourists stifled their march when Amla was caught behind by wicket-keeper Denesh Ramdin for 63 off the bowling of Jason Holder in an important breakthrough for the West Indies.

The skipper losing his wicket immediately after a brief delay for a change of the ball, which had gone out of shape after 75 overs and was deemed no longer usable by the umpires.

Another wicket came after the tourists took the second new ball, with Temba Bavuma bowled by Shannon Gabriel for 15 to leave the hosts on 288-5.

De Villiers continued a chanceless innings with his usual brand of innovative strokes, marking a 37th test half century. Stiaan van Zyl (8) was also not out at lunch as the home side trailed by 16 runs.

A series victory for South Africa will see them retain their ranking as the top test-playing nation.

They won the first test in Pretoria by an innings and 220 runs but drew with the West Indies in the second test in Port Elizabeth in a rain-affected game.
