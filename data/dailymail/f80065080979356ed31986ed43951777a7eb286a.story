Fugitive software tycoon John McAfee has been arrested in Guatemala after slipping into the country illegally and now faces being sent back to Belize where he is wanted for questioning in connection with the murder of his American neighbour.

McAfee, 67, looked wild-eyed and dishevelled as he was filmed being bundled into the back of a police car after being detained by Interpol officers and local law enforcement on the streets of Guatemala City.

Video footage of his arrest shows journalists from Vice magazine, who had been accompanying him over the past few days, asking 'Where are they taking you John?' to which he replies  'to jail'.

Detention: Hours after saying he would seek asylum in Guatemala, McAfee was taken to this holding house for illegal immigrants

McAfee, who has hired the help of high-powered attorney Telésforo Guerra, a former Guatemalan attorney general, was taken in for questioning before being moved to a holding house for illegal immigrants.

Accompanied by his 20-year-old girlfriend Sam Vanegas, he had previously checked in to an upmarket hotel where he had given a series of interviews to various media organisations.

McAfee, who had hoped to claim asylum in
Guatemala, is wanted in Belize for questioning in connection with the 
killing of Gregory Viant Faull, who was shot dead in early November on 
the island where both men lived.

Mr Faull's home was a couple of houses 
down from the guarded compound where McAfee kept several noisy dogs and 
entertained a steady stream of young women brought in from the mainland.

McAfee has denied any wrongdoing and said he was being persecuted for refusing to donate to local politicians.

Belizean
officials have denied persecuting McAfee and the country's prime 
minister has said he suspects the anti-virus software firm founder is 
mentally unstable.

News of his arrest was first posted on 
the Facebook account of Robert King, a photographer and videographer 
from Vice magazine who accompanied the 67-year-old while he escaped to 
Guatemala from Belize.

King's account was later confirmed by Guatemalan Interior Minister Mauricio Lopez Bonilla.

McAfee shacked up with Vanegas in a high-end hotel in Guatemala City after sneaking out of Belize. He has not provided details on how he crossed from Belize into Guatemala.

There, he enlisted the help of high-powered attorney Guerra, who is an uncle of Vanegas.

Also present at the hotel were Rocco Castoro, the editor-in-chief of New York's Vice magazine, and King, who have been traveling with McAfee for the last five days, and 
are filming a documentary that will accompany a magazine article about his time on the run.

Castoro
wrote: '[McAfee] retained the services of Mr. Guerra. He has agreed to 
help John untangle the web of confusion and - according to John - 
corruption that has taken over his life in Belize since April.'

McAfee
claims he is being persecuted by the Belizean government, and he has some
dirt about official corruption in the country, where he lived in a 
compound guarded by aggressive dogs and armed guards.

'I need a safe place where I can actually speak out,' McAfee said on Tuesday. 'Now that I'm here I can speak freely. I can speak openly.'

He told the Associated Press that he will petition the Guatemalan government to allow him to stay, and he fears he will be killed if he turns himself in for questioning in Belize.
