Swansea manager Garry Monk hopes striker Bafetimbi Gomis will be competition for Wilfried Bony and not a replacement.

The France international scored his first goals for two months with two in the 6-2 FA Cup victory over League Two side Tranmere on Saturday.

Gomis will become the Swans' first-choice striker with Bony missing for at least a month due to Ivory Coast duty at the Africa Cup of Nations, but Monk remains hopeful the pair can work together on the top scorer's return.

Bony has scored nine goals in 22 games for the Premier League outfit so far this season

Asked whether he was expecting phone calls from clubs enquiring about prized asset Bony, Monk said: 'I hope not. I can't afford to lose players.

'We haven't got a big squad as it is but what we do have is quality. I am looking to add, I'm not looking to lose any players.'

Gomis scored twice late on at Prenton Park but by then the match was already won after Nathan Dyer, Tom Carroll and Mo Barrow put the visitors 3-0 ahead inside 58 minutes.

Tranmere showed they were not willing to capitulate, with Max Power and Cole Stockton scoring either side of Gomis' first, but substitute Wayne Routledge and Gomis gave the scoreline a slightly flattering appearance.

On Gomis, Monk added: 'Strikers thrive on goals, that's what they are here for.

'Bafe is a quality striker, I have said that all along, and you saw the type of performance he put in and he can take that into this period ahead now.

'He has had limited game-time. He has shown glimpses of what he can do already but the two goals and the performance he put in will do him the world of good.

'They are top goals he scored and it wasn't just his goals, it was his performance and the way he took the goals, his composure.'

Tranmere boss Micky Adams admits the FA Cup exit allows his team to concentrate on the priority of safeguarding their Football League status as they currently sit in the bottom two of League Two.

'I am trying to improve the squad and that is going to be the focus now,' Adams said.

'We were never going to win the cup and our league campaign is important to us now and we have to pick up the points.

'We can't worry about other teams, we have to worry about ourselves and if we show the same desire and application we showed against Swansea we will be fine.

'Since I've been here every time we have conceded a goal or lost a game we have always bounced back and I hope that will be the case at Morecambe next week.' 

Micky Adams believes his side's defeat by Swansea could be a blessing in disguise
