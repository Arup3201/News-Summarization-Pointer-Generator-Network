London's very first bridge might have been the work of the Romans but as these incredible images reveal, subsequent architects certainly weren't short of bright ideas.

From the austere London Bridge, which sits on a site occupied by bridges for more than 2,000 years, to the gaudy crimson and cream steelwork of Blackfriars Bridge, many of the capital's bridges are works of art in their own right.

Now, for the first time, London's 20 river crossings are to get a starring role in a new exhibition, Bridge, which explores the pivotal role they played over the centuries as well as their impact on the arts.

Turn
 of the century: Despite the lack of cars, John Rennie's London Bridge 
was a hive of people, carts and carriages as this photo taken in 1900 
reveals

All change: London Bridge remains a busy place come rush hour but the bridge itself is relatively new: Rennie's bridge was replaced by the current one in 1972

Different view: The view from Tower Bridge has changed markedly since the 1950s and now includes the towering Shard, the UK's (and Europe's) tallest building

Iconic: Henry Grant's photographs of the Houses of Parliament and Westminster Bridge (left) and Tower Bridge with its bascules raised were made in 1965 and 1973

New look: Although the Houses of Parliament and Westminster Bridge look the same as they did during the Victorian period, all are lit up at night

Featuring photos by James Abbott McNeill Whistler, Charles Ginner, William Raban and Lucinda Grange among others, the exhibition, at the Museum of London Docklands, also offers a snapshot of the changing face of the capital over the last 200 years.

Earliest of all the photos is a rare snap taken by pioneering photographer William Henry Fox Talbot in 1845, which shows the original Isambard Kingdom Brunel Hungerford Bridge - demolished just 15 years after it was built.

Fox Talbot invented the precursor to the modern camera and system of fixing photos that dominated the 19th and 20th centuries, until digital photography became pre-eminent in the early years of the 21st.

He began developing his ‘calotype’ system in the 1830s but only published his work in 1839. Until 1845, methods of fixing an image were far from foolproof – and it wasn't until that year that he made his major breakthrough.

Among Fox Talbot's first wave of successful 'calotypes' was a snap of Brunel’s Hungerford Bridge - originally built to serve the Hungerford Market on the north bank of the
 river, which had been set up by Sir Edward Hungerford in 1682 as a competitor to Covent Garden Market.

New bridge: Isambard Kingdom Brunel's suspension bridge was knocked down 15 years after it was built and replaced with this heavier cast iron affair

Packed: Commuters flock across the newly rebuilt London Bridge after its grand opening by the Queen in 1973. The current bridge is the fifth version on the site.

 construction: A rare snap of Tower Bridge as it was being built. 
Although it looks medieval, the bridge is actually Victorian and opened 
in 1894

All done: Tower Bridge, now complete, has swapped its chocolate brown Victorian paint job for a cheerful blue and cream one

Striking: Although Waterloo Bridge dominates the background of this 1869 photo, it was taken to chart the construction of the Metropolitan Line

Looking good: Named after the Duke of Wellington's famous victory over the French at Waterloo, Waterloo Bridge is now pristine and the Metropolitan Line complete

Beautiful:

 photographer who lived most of her life in nearby Chiswick

At 1,462 feet long, the 
bridge was, at the time, one of the longest suspension bridges ever built, although 
Brunel, who was already working on several other projects when he took on the
 Hungerford Bridge work, appeared less than enthused by the project.

An entry in his 1835 diary reads: ‘Suspension 
bridge across the Thames – I have condescended to be engineer of this, 
but I shan’t give myself much trouble about it. If done it will add to 
my stock of irons.’

Despite his lacklustre approach to the work, his bridge proved hugely successful but was later deemed inadequate to meet the demands of the newly opened Charing Cross Station by South Eastern Railway, who purchased it in 1859.

The replacement, designed by Sir John Hawkshaw, opened in 1864 and was built using wrought iron lattice girders, which provided a more stable route in and out of Charing Cross station for the heavy iron steam trains then in their heyday.

Eventful though its history is, Hungerford Bridge isn't the only bridge to have made its mark on the capital. Another that appears in several incarnations in the exhibition is London Bridge which has been demolished and rebuilt no fewer than five times, most recently in 1972.

The very first bridge on the site was the work of the Romans who used it outflank the Britons waiting upriver at the main ford in AD70 and paved the way for the addition of England and Wales, Britannia as it was known to the Romans, to the Roman Empire.

Later versions included a wooden bridge that was badly damaged during fighting between armies loyal to Anglo-Saxon king Ethelred the Unready and Viking king Canute in 1014, and the first stone version which was completed in 1209.

As remembered in the nursery rhyme, part of this London Bridge really did fall down thanks to neglect on the part of the hugely unpopular Queen Eleanor of Castile who was given the bridge by her husband Henry III in 1249.

No change on this side! Looking at this modern photo of commuters streaming across London Bridge, little appears to have changed since the 1930s

Still peaceful: Richmond Bridge has barely changed at all over the last century and remains a pretty, tranquil place to cross the Thames

cry from the bustling crowds that flock onto the bridges downstream

Busy: In the 1930s, the Thames was crammed with shipping as this 1935 photo (left) reveals. By the 1960s, it was the bridges, as in this Waterloo shot, that were packed

Later, the bridge was famously used to display the heads of traitors executed at the nearby tower, beginning with Scottish rebel William Wallace who was made an example of by Edward I 'Hammer of the Scots' in 1305.

The medieval bridge stood for more than 600 years but in 1831, it was decided a new bridge was needed and a John Rennie design was chosen. Seven years later, the new London Bridge was opened by William IV and Queen Adelaide, but only lasted until the 1960s thanks to the increasing numbers of cars wanting to use it.

Other bridges to appear include the iconic Tower Bridge, the new Hungerford Bridge and the even more modern Millennium Bridge. Vauxhall Bridge, which gets its name from a 13th century French mercenary employed by King John, who built 'Fulke's Hall' on the site, also stars in the show.

Speaking about the new exhibition and the incredible Talbot calotype that appears in it, curator Francis Marshall said: 'I’m incredibly excited that visitors will have the opportunity to get up close to such a significant early photograph – taken at a time when the medium was still evolving.

'By contrasting the old barges in the foreground with the Brunel's new iron bridge, Fox Talbot highlights the technological advances of the 19th century.

'The photographic process he pioneered would dominate image-making for the next 150 years, until the dawn of digital photography. In a way, he is responsible for the way in which we see the world today. Ironically, Brunel’s bridge was demolished within fifteen years to make way for a railway crossing.

'This delicate salt print has never been out on public display before. Because of its age and the fact that Fox Talbot only perfected his process in 1845; we are not taking any unnecessary risks with it.'

Bridge opens at the Museum of London Docklands on the 27th June and runs until the 2nd November. See museumoflondon.org for more information.

London's 20 bridges are a familiar sight to commuters and tourists who pass them every day but there's more to the capital's bridges than iron and steel. From the bridge with a paint job chosen by Queen Victoria to the river crossing that doubled as a market, London's bridges are as fascinating as its palaces.
