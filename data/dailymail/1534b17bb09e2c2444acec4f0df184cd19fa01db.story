A 911 dispatcher is under investigation after security footage proved she was using her cell phone during an emergency call while the victim lay dying.

The call center operator, Shauna Justice, was training a new staff member in Volusia County, Florida, when the call came through on September 4.

Bob Hill, 58, had suffered a heart attack while playing a game of racquetball with friends.

In video footage of the incident - obtained by Click Orlando - Justice is seen using her cell phone while her subordinate entered the wrong location.

911 dispatcher Shauna Justice is said to be 'very remorseful' about using her cell phone on duty. She now faces a five day suspension

The trainee accidentally sent the ambulance to a different recreational center following a miscommunication with the person reporting the emergency.

Fifteen minutes passed before paramedics arrived at the scene.

Deceased: Bob Hill, 58, died of a heart attack while waiting for paramedics to arrive

Mr Hill died in that time.

In the 911 call, the caller clearly states the cross streets of his location, but said the wrong name of the center.

He misidentified Nova Community Center, which is in Ormond beach, as the 'Ormond Rec Center'.

Instead of sending paramedics to the cross streets, the trainee dispatcher looked up 'Ormond Rec Center' and sent units to 176 Division Avenue.

The dispatcher is heard guiding the caller through CPR, but almost 10 minutes passes before he realizes his mistake.

An internal review said Justice failed to properly supervise.

It is believed that, had Justice not been looking at her phone, the proper address would have been identified.

Volusia County Sheriff Ben Johnson said Justice was 'remorseful' about the incident.

Mishap: Emergency crews were sent to the wrong recreational center. Supervisor Shauna Justice was on her cell phone when a trainee entered the address. It took 15 minutes to get to the correct location

'She admitted her mistake,' he said.

'We messed up.

'She was very remorseful about what happened, very caring about it.

'She admitted to what her mistake was.'

Volusia County Sheriff Ben Johnson said 911 dispatcher Shauna Justice was 'remorseful' and had 'admitted her mistake'

It's unclear whether the mistake contributed to Hill's death.

Johnson, however, still said it was a 'serious mistake' that 'could have been avoided'.

Justice is now facing a five day suspension.

The dispatcher who handled the call was given a written reprimand but was not taken off the job.
