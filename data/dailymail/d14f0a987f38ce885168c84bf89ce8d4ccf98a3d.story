Police are hunting a suspected robber who copied a crime that featured in a storyline of BBC1 hospital drama Casualty.

It is believed the man they want to 
question in relation to an incident on August 6 was copying an episode of the popular show called Bedside Manner, in which robbers leave a doll by the side of the 
road in a bid to lure victims into a trap.

Sussex Police confirmed it was investigating reports of a man who had been seen lurking in bushes near Crawley shortly after placing a baby doll by the side of the road.

Drama: The storyline from BBC1 show Casualty featured a baby doll left at the side of a country lane

Sussex Police had initially refused to 
investigate believing it to be an online urban myth that 'surfaces 
periodically', but backtracked when more witnesses came forward.

The episode, called Bedside Manner, aired on August 3, just three days before the force first started receiving reports of a similar real-life crime.

It features a couple, Elliot and Susan, who are driving along a country road when they spot what they think is a real baby abandoned on the verge in a car seat.

When Elliot gets out to check the baby is all right - only to find it is a child's toy - he is set upon by three men wearing sackcloths over their faces.

As two of the thugs beat him up, one of them approaches Susan, who is still in the car, and smashes her window before grabbing her handbag.

She drives at the robber, knocking him over before swerving and plunging down a hill.

On August 6, motorists reported to police that they had seen a man 'lurking in the bushes' by a roundabout in Bewbush in West Sussex, after first placing a doll by the side of the road.

Attack: In the episode, called Bedside Manner, one of the victims is set upon after stopping the car to help

Several witnesses stated online that the scam was 'similar to the storyline in Casualty' aired three days earlier.

One, with the username gcunningham212, wrote: 'This is exactly the same as what happened on Casualty.

'Robbers lie in wait for someone to stop and check on the baby and then attack them. Scary.'

Although the matter was reported to police that day, the force has admitted it originally dismissed the matter as an online urban myth which 'surfaces periodically'.

But after more witnesses came forward, the force backtracked and said it was now taking the incident seriously.

A spokeswoman said: 'Unfortunately, 
this report coincided with a recent response we made to the hoax 'baby 
seat in road' scam which has been doing the rounds for several years.

'However, this report is being taken seriously.'

Copycat: After being attacked, the woman in the car drives at one of the robbers, before crashing off the road

The
online warning is usually sent by email or posted on social networking,
sites such as Facebook, and sent to millions of people around the world
about not stopping when they see a car seat with a baby in it.

It states: 'While driving on any roads, if you see a baby car seat sitting on the side of the road, do not stop, this could be a gang's trap.

'They target people especially women, to stop their vehicle to help a baby. They make this baby look as if it has blood on itself or on its clothes.

'When you exit from your vehicle in attempt to help, the gangs jump out - they have beaten women to near death, and then rape them.

'Their goal is to torture the victims to death in any way possible. If you do happen to see a car seat, do not stop, call police immediately.

'Please forward this message to everyone you know.'

The message has been viewed by millions around the world, with police forces regularly having to issue statements denying the events are taking place.
