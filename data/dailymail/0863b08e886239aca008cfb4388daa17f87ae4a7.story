Manchester United midfielder Ander Herrera has an outside chance of making Monday’s Premier League trip to West Brom.

The Spain international broke a rib three weeks ago and was expected to miss six weeks of football. 

However, Herrera has made rapid progress with his recovery and has told United boss Louis van Gaal that he can play against West Brom with a painkilling injection.
