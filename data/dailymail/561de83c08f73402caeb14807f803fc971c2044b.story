A regional benefits cap, taxes on disability benefits and a limit on child benefit to the first two children could be introduced in a new welfare squeeze after the general election.

Leaked Whitehall documents show officials have drawn up a series of options that could be used to further reduce the benefits bill.

All the main parties are committed to money-saving welfare reform, but the Conservatives have pledged to make the deepest cuts, taking £12billion out of welfare in the next Parliament.

A regional benefits cap, taxes on disability benefits and a limit on child benefit to the first two children could be introduced in a new welfare squeeze

A two-year freeze on some benefits and a lowering of the new benefits cap – the maximum amount in benefits a household can receive – from £26,000 to £23,000 are already on the agenda. The Institute for Fiscal Studies suggests those measures would save £2billion a year by 2017-18.

But documents leaked to the BBC also suggested a regional benefits cap, an idea backed by Labour, as one possibility. The £23,000 limit would vary across the country, with the highest sum paid in London, where housing costs are greatest.

It is said that limiting child benefit to the first two children for future claimants would save £1billion a year.

Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said the proposals were not Tory party policy

The documents also proposed taxing disability benefits – a move that would prove highly controversial. This would mean better-off claimants losing some of their payments, and would save £1.5billion a year.

Carer’s allowance could be restricted to the most needy, saving £1billion. And the contributory element of employment and support allowance and jobseekers’ allowance would be reined in. Currently claimants who have paid enough National Insurance contributions can get the benefits with little means-testing.

Some 30 per cent of claimants, over 300,000 families, would lose about £80 per week, saving taxpayers £1.3billion. 

Council tax support, meanwhile, could be incorporated into the new universal credit, which is gradually replacing all the main out-of-work benefits and tax credits. And replacing the industrial injuries compensation scheme with an insurance policy for employees would save £1billion.

The Tories insisted that the proposals were not party policy and had been prepared by officials considering all options for the next government, of whatever make-up.

‘It’s wrong to suggest that any of this is part of our plan,’ said a spokesman for Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith. 

Labour Work and Pensions spokesman Rachel Reeves, said: ‘These plans were drawn up for Conservative ministers to deliver their extreme cuts plan. The Tories now need to come clean about what cuts they plan to make.’
