Queen Mary with the  future George VI

Heartfelt love letters to Queen Victoria, baby books created  by a doting Queen Mary, even Elizabeth I's household accounts - the Royal Archives held at Windsor Castle since 1914 contain rarely seen regal documents going back 700 years.

And now, along with a new book, 25 of its most impressive treasures are on display at the Castle, many for the first time, to mark its centenary year.

The oldest document in the archive is a list of jewels from the wardrobe of Edward I, written in Norman French in 1297 and acquired by George V in 1911.

Among the Tudor treasures are the household accounts of Princess Elizabeth, later Elizabeth I. Compiled in the early 1550s when she was in her teens,  it details the expenses for the scullery and 'saucery' - where sauces were prepared - at Hatfield House, with each page elaborately signed by the princess.

Another account book, from the reign of Charles II, reveals even kings had to deal with decorators. It details work done at Windsor Castle in the late 17th century, stating that Italian artist Antonio Verrio was paid £10,000 (£850,000 today) for doing 20 ceilings, the King's Private Chapel and St George's Hall.

In 1912, just before the archive moved to Windsor, it acquired 30 large boxes of papers belonging to George III and his son George IV that were discovered in the basement of Apsley House in London.

Labelled 'To Be Destroyed Unread', they'd lain there since the Duke of Wellington, executor of the younger George's will, had received them in 1830. They included the 1763 title deed for George III's purchase of Buckingham Palace for £28,000 (£3.5m today).

Originally called Buckingham House, it was intended as a private residence for his new wife Charlotte. It became known as the Queen's House and 14 of the couple's 15 children were born there.

A more sensational document, which can be seen in the accompanying book, dates from 22 years later. It's a sham marriage 'certificate' handwritten by George, Prince of Wales, when he attempted to wed Maria Fitzherbert, a twice-widowed Roman Catholic.

The ceremony was held in her drawing room at Park Street in London, conducted by an Anglican priest who had been let out of the Fleet Prison for the occasion and witnessed by Maria's brother and uncle.

The ceremony was illegal as it violated the Royal Marriages Act, which stipulated the monarch's permission was needed for descendants of George II to marry, and also the 1701 Act of Settlement which prohibited a British sovereign, reigning or future, from marrying a Catholic.

Queen Victoria, a prodigious letter-writer, also kept a diary for 68 years from 1832 until her death. It's estimated she wrote 2,500 words a day, some 60 million words during her lifetime.

The display features the first of 141 volumes. Written on 2 August 1832, it describes the 13-year-old princess's progress through the industrial West Midlands on her way to Wales where the people were 'black', the country 'desolate', and the buildings 'flaming with fire'.

Eight years later she married her cousin Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. He was clearly besotted with his bride-to-be, as a never-before-displayed letter tells us. Written in German, it begins, 'Dearest deeply loved Victoria,' and continues, 'your image fills my whole soul. Even in my dreams I never imagined I should find so much love on earth.'

Victoria's heir, Edward VII, and his consort Queen Alexandra requested that their private papers be destroyed after their deaths. A few letters did survive, however, and appear in the book including one from Alexandra to her son George - later George V - in which she describes motoring 'at 50. miles!! an hour!'

The Queen appears to have been a bit of a back seat driver: 'I poke him violently in the back at every corner to go gently and whenever a dog, child or anything else comes in our way,' but by the summer of 1901 she had moved into the driver's seat, having instructed her lady-in-waiting to contact the Automobile Club in April. Miss Knollys duly wrote to one of its senior members that 'the Queen as  well as myself will be most grateful for some instruction in driving'.

The book also features some eye-opening documents from the 20th century. One reveals King George V's voracious appetite for reading - he got through more than 1,000 works between 1890 and 1936, including the sensational Lady Chatterley's Lover, which was first published privately in Italy in 1928.

A fully unexpurgated version was not published in Britain until 1960 after a dramatic obscenity trial, but the 68-year-old King obtained a copy in 1933 from John Colville, whose mother Lady Cynthia was a lady-in-waiting to George V's consort Queen Mary.

We're also given a different perspective on the character of Queen Mary, who comes across as an emotionally rather chilly character in biographies.

For example when, after her death in 1953, her eldest son the Duke of Windsor wrote to his wife, 'I'm afraid the fluids in her veins have always been as icy cold as they are now in death.' The archives, however, show a soft side to her.

For each of her six children she faithfully kept a baby book in which she recorded their first steps, first words, even their first outing in the royal pram as well as their signatures from the age of eight to 21, locks of their hair and dozens of photographs.

Elizabeth II keeps a diary too, memorably telling two of her ministers, Neil Kinnock and Kenneth Baker, in the 1992 documentary Elizabeth R that it wasn't like Queen Victoria's. When Kinnock asked her if she writes it in her own hand she joked, 'Well, I can't write any other way!'

The monarchy now has a website, a Royal Channel on YouTube and is on Twitter, and the challenge for the next century of royal archival life is going to be how to preserve all those emails, text messages and tweets.

Treasures From The Royal Archives, Windsor Castle, until 25 January 2015. The book is £19.95 from Royal Collection Trust shops; £29.95 from bookshops.
