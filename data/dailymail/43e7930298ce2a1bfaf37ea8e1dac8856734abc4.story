A man has died after trying to swim across the River Thames when he missed the last ferry home.

The man, believed to be in his twenties, drowned yesterday evening in Hampton, Middlesex, when it is believed his backpack became filled with water.

A pair of schoolboys who were sat on the river bank dived in to try and save the man after hearing the screams of a woman who was swimming with him.

Tragic: The Hampton river crossing where a man drowned last night after trying to swim across the Thames after missing the last ferry across

Dangerous stretch of water: The unnamed man, thought to be in his 20s, drowned in a stretch of the river close to Hampton Sailing Club

His body was later discovered in shallow water nearby a couple of hours later and the woman was unharmed in the incident

Schoolboys Pete Sullivan and Jack Sweeney, both 15, said they saw the man and woman walking to the ferry's jetty but having missed it they started swimming.

Pete, a pupil at Esher High School, said: 'I was sitting by the river with my friends when this man walked along the towpath with a woman who I think was his stepmum. They reached the ferry crossing, but had missed the last one of the day.

'He got about three-quarters of the way across when he just went under the water and didn't come back up.

'Jack and I dived in to see if we 
could help. We got to where he was and looked all around the bottom, but
we didn't know where he was.'

Search operation: Emergency services taped off an area of the river bank during the search yesterday evening

Pete added: 'She was about a quarter of the way and started screaming, "Help! My God, he is drowning". 

'She was in a state of shock, so I 
told her to calm down and go back to the bank otherwise she was going to
get herself drowned as well.'

Earlier in the day the man and woman took the ferry from Hampton to Moulsey Hurst.

Hampton Ferry Worker Ben Heath, who described the man as in his 20s or early 30s, said: 'I was expecting them to come over on the return journey before I finished at 6pm but they didn’t.

'It looked like they were going to have a couple of drinks. I think they’d already been drinking. They smelled of it and they sounded a bit drunk.

'Plenty of people go swimming here but nothing like this really happens. Police, fire crews, paramedics and a search helicopter were scrambled to the scene but were too late to save the man.

Safe crossing: The man and his female companion decided to swim across the river after missing the last Hampton ferry of the day

Local residents have described the incident as an 'accident waiting to happen' due to the number of people who swim in the river and are unaware of dangerous fast flowing currents.

One resident, whose home overlooks the stretch of river, said: 'The police had 20 calls in one day 
about people swimming across the river from Hurst Park to the sailing 
club despite the warnings of the strong currents and all the boats 
passing through.

'When the weather’s hot we have around
30 children swimming over to the island in the middle of the river 
where the sailing club is, they jump off the roof into the water and 
cause damage.

'This must be a warning to the kids as
it was an accident waiting to happen, but the kids don’t always know 
the danger so it’s up to the parents to make sure they aren’t swimming 
there.'

Popular spot: Local residents say that people often swim in the river, unaware that there are dangerously strong currents

A
spokesman for Surrey Police said: 'A man’s body has been found in the 
River Thames near Hampton, following a search for a man after concerns 
were raised for his safety earlier in the evening.

'Officers were called to the area near Hampton sailing club around 6.45pm after a man was seen to enter the water.'

He added: 'Inquiries are 
ongoing to trace next of kin. At this stage in the investigation the 
death is being treated as unexplained.'
