All construction came to an abrupt halt at the new $1.2 billion San Francisco 49ers showcase stadium after a delivery truck driver was crushed early Monday by a bundle of rebar being unloaded from his truck.

Police, firefighters and state workplace safety officials are investigating the Santa Clara, California incident, which was the second deadly workplace accident on the site in less than four months.

The 61-year-old Vacaville, California resident was severely injured by the heavy mass of steel bars as an ambulance rushed him to a local hospital, where he died.

Tragic: On the ground is the bundle of rebar that presumably rolled off a 61-year-old driver's truck as he delivered it to the new San Francisco 49ers stadium. He was rushed to the hospital and pronounced dead

‘We are deeply saddened to confirm that the driver has passed away as a result of his injuries,’ spokesman Jonathan Harvey said.

The man was an employee of Gerdau Ameristeel's Napa Reinforcing Steel facility, a subcontractor on Levi Stadium, said Gerdau Ameristeel spokeswoman Kimberly M. Selph.

In a statement, the 49ers said their ‘sincerest thoughts and prayers are with the family, friends and co-workers affected by this tragedy.’

Again: The 61-year-old Vacaville man was the second worker to die at the Santa Clara site of the new $1.2 billion stadium

The Santa Clara stadium is replacing Candlestick park, which lies about 40 miles to the north. It will be known as Levi’s Stadium.

Construction is slated to be finished in July, and crews have been working in high gear to meet that deadline. Officials say the accelerated work plan involves a highly coordinated scheme to maximize efficiency and avoid delays.

Construction firm investigators also were on-scene Monday, to see what could have been done to prevent what is now the second deadly accident at the site.

An elevator mechanic, 63-year-old Donald White, was killed at the stadium June 11 when he was struck by a counterweight while working in a shaft.

Jinxed? The $1.2 billion 49ers stadium is being built to replace Candlestick park and will be known as Levi's stadium. In June, a 63-year-old elevator installer was also killed at the site

White worked as an elevator mechanic for more than 40 years and was employed by Schindler Elevator Corp.

The $1.2 billion stadium project is expected to open its doors just in time to host the 50th Super Bowl, in 2015, in the heart of the Silicon Valley. The airy, open stadium would have the largest lower bowl in the league, ensuring the 68,500 fans are close to the action.

The construction costs are being paid by $800 million in seat and luxury box sales, along with a 20-year, $220 million naming rights agreement with Levi Strauss and Co. announced in May.

'We are deeply saddened to confirm that the driver has passed away as a result of his injuries,' spokesman for the construction company Jonathan Harvey said Monday. Here, the growing structure can be seen over a fence
