An Ohio judge ordered the state to return 11 exotic animals - six tigers, a black leopard, lion, Kodiak bear, liger, and bobcat - to an animal sanctuary  only hours after they were taken away.

Judge Reeve Kelsey issued an injunction yesterday ordering that the animals should be returned to owner Kenny Hetrick's farm at Stony Ridge for their safety.

The state had tranquilized and transported the animals to a holding facility near Columbus after Hetrick was denied a permit to keep them. A wolf hybrid that lives on Hetrick's property was not seized because state law does not prohibit that type of animal.

State veterinarians at the facility will evaluate the animals to determine if they are ready for the 130-mile return trip. It's unclear when they will be brought back to Tiger Ridge.

Erica Hawkins, an Agriculture Department spokeswoman, said: 'We're not going to transport them until they're safe.' 

She added it's possible the state could also look into other legal options.

'They shouldn't have been taken in the first place,' Hetrick said after the injunction was granted by Judge  Kelsey, according to the Toledo Blade. 

'I should have had a hearing and I never got one.'

'Today, the Ohio Department of Agriculture did the right thing by seizing the wild animals at Tiger Ridge Exotics who have been held illegally and long neglected. 

Now, it's been reported that the animals will possibly have to endure the stress of being tranquilized again and moved back to the roadside zoo—a potentially life-threatening move. 

This is a selfish stunt to prevent the animals from being sent to a sanctuary where they would finally receive the care that they so desperately need. 

PETA is calling on the facility to do the right thing and allow these animals to enjoy a peaceful life at a reputable sanctuary where their needs would come first.'

Hetrick has been fighting to keep the animals since October, when the state said he needed to  surrender them because he had failed to get the necessary permits to keep them. 

If he did not voluntarily surrender the animals they would be taken from him by the state, it said.

In order to obtain a permit, owners are required to pass a background check, pay fees, obtain liability insurance or surety bonds and show they can properly contain and care for animals. 

Regulators denied Hetrick's permit because it was filed late and an inspection found that the facility's fencing was not adequate, some padlocks and chains were not secured and some cages had exposed metal that could have harmed the animals. 

However, volunteers have helped Hetrick make improvements at the farm. 

Exotic animal owners in Ohio were required to obtain a permit after dozens of wild animals were released by a suicidal owner at his eastern Ohio farm in Zanesville in 2011.

Authorities hunted down and killed most of those animals, among them black bears, Bengal tigers and African lions. 

Hetrick's daughter said the family is 'not going to stand for it.'

Corrina Hetrick added: 'We're going to fight it to the end. We're not giving up.' 

A hearing on a permanent injunction stopping the seizure of the animals is set for February 10.

A petition has been started on Change.org urging Ohio Governor John Kasich to help keep Tiger Ridge Exotics open. 

It reads: 'Kenny Hetrick of Tigerridge [sic] exotics has been home to many, many exotic big cats. 

'He has been open free of charge 365 days a year for over 20 years. 

'He has been USDA licensed since 1989 and has provided a safe and healthy environment for the animals. We are in need of all the public support to fight this.

'This is not some road side zoo, this is a place where thousands of people have brought their families to see some of the most beautiful creatures on earth.

'These animals are well taken care of, and have never harmed anyone. 

'We just want them to be able to finish out their lives at home where they belong.

'The animals are in extreme danger of being yanked from the only home they have ever known to be either killed or placed in another facility no better than ours.'

Almost 4,100 people have already signed the petition.

Tigers featured in the Russell Crowe film Gladiator were born at Tiger Ridge, according to the farm's official website.
