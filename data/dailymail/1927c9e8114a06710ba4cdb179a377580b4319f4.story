Paris’ top cop got more than he bargained for when he recently visited a tourist hot spot to see the French capital’s notorious ‘bracelet scammers’ at work.

Police Commissioner Bernard Boucault and Jacques Meric, the city’s head of public safety, were physically attacked by the crooks when they made the official visit to the neighbourhood of Montmartre last Saturday.

The pair wanted to observe the aggressive scammers after receiving a constant stream of complaints from tourists and locals, but they became victims themselves.

Mr Boucault, Mr Meric and their chauffeur confronted a group of ‘tresseurs’ or braiders after they exited their vehicle at Louise-Michel Square, according to French magazine Le Point and The Local.

The attack occurred as they attempted to stop the street hustlers, who were targeting tourists. 

The police commissioner was slapped, his chauffeur was punched and Mr Meric was kicked.

There was no word on whether any of the assailants were caught or charged, The Local reported.

In the so-called ‘bracelet scam’, crooks tie string to a tourist’s finger or wrist and weave it into a friendship bracelet, and then order the tourist to hand over money in return.

Threats often follow if a tourist refuses to buy the bracelet.

Montmartre is notorious for street hustlers who intimidate visitors with a variety of gimmicks.

Other scams include a three-card sleight of hand trick that encourages the victim to place a bet on the location of a pea or a disc under a cup.
