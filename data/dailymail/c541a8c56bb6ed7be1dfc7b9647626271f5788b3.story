When it was unveiled earlier this month, Scotland's uniform for the Commonwealth Games was widely ridiculed. There was even a petition set up which gained hundreds of signatures calling for it to be replaced.

But this evening, Scottish athletes wore the lurid bright blue tartan with pride as they walked round Celtic Park stadium in Glasgow during the championship's opening ceremony.

The athletes paraded in front of the stadium crowd, which included the Queen, in their Jilli Blackwood designed outfits which have been described as 'embarrassing', 'shocking' and 'humiliating' by people on social media.

Who's laughing now: The Scots were happy to show off their much ridiculed uniforms at the opening ceremony

Host nation: The Scots outfits certainly meant they stood out in Celtic Park stadium

Unpopular: The Scotland kit was ridiculed when it was unveiled earlier this month

The designer said she wanted to give traditional tartan a contemporary twist by teaming it with bright blue shirts and dresses. But those who signed a petition, started by Glaswegian Brian Scott on Change.org calling for it to be ditched, said it made a mockery of the host nation.

But Scotland weren't the only country whose kit has been lambasted in the run up to the games.

The Australian outfits designed by Adele Walters, from Australian Defence Apparel, also left a lot to be desired.

Without sparing their peer's feelings, another fashion designer, Charlie Brown, said the Aussie jackets have a 'Captain Kirk from Star Trek' look to them and that the jumpers look 'homemade.'

The Australia team were also equipped
 with woolly scarves to help them keep warm during the British summer.

Walters told the MailOnline earlier this month that she wasn't bothered about the criticism.

'I don't want to dwell on the 
negatives,' she said. 'I've heard it, and you expect it from some 
people, I'd rather talk about the positives.'

Walters was the lead 
designer on the project in a team of five, who constructed the uniforms 
based on its functionality, comfort and style. She said the uniform's 'brief' had been stuck too and that the athletes 
approved. 

They certainly looked proud as they modelled the yellow and green kit this evening.

Perhaps
 they felt they didn't look so silly after all after seeing the uniforms
 of some of their fellow competitors from other countries.

Tropical: The team from the Cook Islands wore flowers in their hair with their floral print frocks

Feminine: The British Virgin Island team wore colourful frilled dresses

Drab trousers: The England team were full of enthusiasm if not style

The Scots weren't the only ones in 
tartan as the team from St Lucia also wore the pattern and the Canadians
 wore tartan trousers.

While some countries like St Helena 
stuck to track suits in their nation's colours, others were more 
adventurous with their outfits.

The Malaysian uniform was certainly 
eye-catching. Their bright orange garb was accessorised with tiger print
 - but poignantly, they also wore black arm bands in remembrance of the 
victims of the recent Malaysian airline disasters.

The Maldives were also prepared to shine as night fell on the stadium as they wore high-vis style neon jackets.

The Cook Islands, Norfolk Island and 
Papua New Guinea all paid homage to their tropical climates with bright 
Hawaiian style shirts. The Cook Island female athletes topped off their looks 
with colourful flower garlands on their heads.

Sticking with tradition: The team from Tonga wore their formal attire of woven mats - but this athlete also embraced the host nation by donning a Celtic shirt

Surf's up: Norfolk Island's squad wore bright shirts

More tartan: This time in the St Lucia team outfits

Neon: The athletes from The Maldives were brightly dressed

Ready to board: Singapore's team looked a little like air hostesses with their red blazers and silk scarves

All Blacks: The New Zealand kit also kept with tradition

On trend: The Welsh women look good in flattering red dresses

Team Wales: The cardigans gave the outfits a more relaxed look

Like the Scots in their kilts, the 
team from Tonga chose to reflect their country's signature style by 
wearing their traditional formal attire which consists of woven mats.

Meanwhile, the team from Barbados looked like a an American High School team in their baseball style jackets while the team from Singapore were reminiscent of air hostesses in their red jackets and silk scarves.

One team who didn't stand out from 
the crowd was England, who played it safe in black blazers, red 
shirts and drab beige trousers.

The New Zealand athletes also stuck to what they know - wearing black rugby-style shirts.

The red dress has quickly started to overtake the LBD and so the Welsh team took the prize for the most on trend style with their flattering red dresses.

But of course the athletes won't be 
concerned about who tops the table in the style stakes - it's all about 
the medals and they will now be battling to do their countries proud in their sporting fields as the 
championship begins.
