Low socio-economic status: The woman was buried in a grave covered with tiles called tegulae - a common form of burial in the Roman era

The body of a Roman woman with a tumour in her pelvis embedded with four deformed teeth and a bone has been uncovered by archaeologists.

The 30-something woman, whose body was interred in a necropolis near Lleida, in the Catalonia region of Spain, died some 1,600 years ago, researchers believe.

An examination of the corpse revealed she suffered from a condition known to doctors as an ovarian teratoma - a Greek-derived term meaning, roughly, a 'monster swelling in the ovaries'.

Such tumours stem from mutations of 
the germ cells which form human eggs; they have the potential to create 
hair, teeth and bone - or even more complex organs like eyes.

It
 is understood that it is the first time scientists have found this type
 of teratoma in human remains dating back to ancient times.

'This is an extraordinary case, not 
only for its antiquity, but also its identification in the 
archaeological record,' wrote the researchers in a study published 
recently in the International Journal of Paleopathology.

Despite
 its gruesome contents, it's possible that the bizarre tumour, which is 
about 1.7 inches in diameter at its largest point, never caused the 
woman any symptoms, the researchers note.

However, they add, its also possible 
that it was the ultimate cause of her untimely death, since 'sometimes 
the development of teratomas results in displacement and functional 
disturbances of adjacent organs'.

Other
 possible fatal effects of the tumour could have been infections, 
hemolytic anemia and pregnancy complications, the team noted.

The
 tumour would not have been outwardly obvious, however, and researchers 
admit they can't tell for certain what effect it had on the woman.

Lead researcher Núria Armentano, of the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, told LiveScience: 'We suppose that, at least during a long part of her life, she was completely unaware of this tumor.'

She
 said that 'depending on the eventual complications, she could have 
suffered' but that there is no evidence of that. 'She could have died 
because of many other causes!' Ms Armentano added.

The owner of the tumour lived in a period
 when the Roman Empire was in sharp decline as barbarian invaders 
flooded in from the north, eventually overrunning France, Spain and 
other territories.

She was gound in a necropolis with only a few artefacts buried with her. Tiles known as tegulae had been put over her to give her grave a kind of gabled roof

'Tegulae graves were the most common Roman burials,' said Ms Armentano. 'She was not an important or rich person. She had a low socio-economic status.'

It is thought to be the first time such a tumour has been discovered in a corpse that dates back to ancient times
