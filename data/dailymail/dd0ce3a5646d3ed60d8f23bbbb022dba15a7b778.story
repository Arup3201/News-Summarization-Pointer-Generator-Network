Legal action: Natalie Creane was left with a life-threatening brain condition after a TV panel fell on her head in a five-star hotel four years ago

The British newlywed left with a life-threatening brain condition after a TV panel fell on her head in a five-star hotel has spoken for the first time about her four-year ordeal.

Natalie Creane, 33, said she cannot be left alone after the incident in the Emirates Palace Hotel in Abu Dhabi left her suffering epileptic seizures and a traumatic brain injury.

She said: 'I do not live a normal life and I never will.'

As she can only walk and talk with great difficulty, Mrs Creane took a week to articulate the trauma of the past four years.

During that time she has been locked in a battle for compensation with the Emirates Palace hotel.

She suffered a string of debilitating injuries when a TV panel in her hotel room, which she says was not fixed properly to the top of a wardrobe, fell on her head in July 2008.

Since then she has endured epileptic seizures, post-traumatic brain injury and is on constant medication.

The hotel where she had been celebrating her engagement refutes her claims and used pictures of her wedding from her Facebook page in court to show she was living a normal life.

But former human resources director Mrs Creane said the devastating toll on her and her family had left them in anything but a normal state.

She added: 'I lost my career, my quality of life, my independence, my peace of mind. My body feels like it should be on someone far beyond my years and our entire family is traumatised beyond belief.'

She described her eventual wedding to her husband Trevor, 42, which had to be postponed three times and was finally held in the summer of 2009.

'Doing things that to people who do 
not know us may seem normal does not change what has happened to us - the
pain, the suffering, the trauma, everything we have gone through,' she 
said.

'The day I tried on 
my wedding dress, I had to be held up by two people and my mum. I was 
too weak to stand and I had so much pain in my hands and arms from all 
the canulas and needles as I had just been discharged from hospital in 
the UK.

'By the time we finally did get married, I had completely forgotten what the dress looked like.'

Mrs Creane added that, on her big day, she had to hide bald patches where her hair had fallen out with hair extensions.

She said: 'I wanted to look like a healthy, normal person after I had looked so ill for so long.

'Although
I was exhausted, drugged up and had a bad headache for most of the day,
I was so happy to finally be able to marry the man who had loved me, 
taken care of me, sat with me in hospital after hospital and whom I 
loved more than anything in the world.

'Every
normal thing they try and use against me that I have been able to do 
since the accident has taken so much strength and determination and has 
not been normal at all. It has been under so many medications and so 
much pain and trauma.

'Even on my better days, I do not live a normal life and I never will.'

Mrs
Creane said her 'better days' were still far worse than any bad day she
had experienced before the incident, adding she tried to remain upbeat.

'I
tried to do whatever I could to live my life the best I could with a 
smile on my face, knowing it could always be worse,' she said.

But she admitted she is terrified of what the future might bring and cannot sleep at night.

Mrs
Creane has been in a medically-induced coma five times and collapsed on
a number of occasions, breaking bones and once nearly drowning in the 
bath during a seizure when she slipped underwater. Her mother Angie 
Smith pulled her out just in time.

She
has been admitted to intensive care more than 20 times and on each 
occasion, her mother and father Derick have flown from their home in 
Essex to be by her side at the Dubai home she has shared with Trevor 
since they moved to the United Arab Emirates nine years ago.

She
cannot be left alone and is often too weak to perform the simplest of 
tasks. Her husband said: 'She is unsteady, listless and not with it 100 
per cent all of the time.'

Her family took a week to transcribe her description of her ordeal, the first time she has spoken about her suffering.

They
posted it on a Facebook campaign page they started called Justice For 
Natalie, where they are garnering support for their £3.5million 
compensation claim to pay for her medical bills.

Natalie Creane had just got engaged to husband Trevor and was celebrating in Abu Dhabi when the piece of wood fell on her in 2008

In
a statement, they said it had taken a week and many tears to write down
what she had said: 'Some of you may not know but Nat has her own 
language called Nat speak.

'It
is a special language she texts or writes when she is unwell or is on 
certain medications so it took me rather some time to make [this] make 
any sense - but the words are all hers.'

Her father added: 'Our family has been to hell and back and it is only getting worse.

'All we want is to see Nat happy and 
healthy and while we realise she will never be the same, we know that by
getting the best treatment she can have a better quality of life and so
can her husband.'

The online campaign now has nearly 
13,000 supporters. The Creanes are preparing to go back to Abu Dhabi 
Higher Civil Claims Court in September for the next round in the battle 
against Emirates Palace hotel.

The tourist attraction - where rooms 
cost up to £8,000 a night and cappuccinos are served with flakes of real
gold leaf - has denied responsibility.

It
stated her injuries were 'a figment of the claimant's imagination', 
adding as the TV panel weighed 2.2kg, it could not have inflicted the 
trauma she described.

The 
hotel has claimed the wardrobe could have been tampered with, disputed 
medical records and in a statement to the court said: 'We have presented
evidence showing she has continued with her lifestyle as normal.'

The case continues.
