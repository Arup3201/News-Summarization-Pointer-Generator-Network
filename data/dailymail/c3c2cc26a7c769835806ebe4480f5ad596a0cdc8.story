A Queensland man says he has not paid a toll since the government switched to an electronic-only payment system on toll roads, no longer providing an option for motorists to pay cash.

Bob Jarvis, 68, a former councillor from Tewantin says it is his 'constitutional right' to pay by cash and that Queensland Motorways should provide an option for people to pay tolls using coins.

Mr Jarvis, who frequently drives across the Gateway Bridge between Brisbane and Noosa, said the first time he drove across the bridge after they removed the option for motorists to pay by cash he did not understand the e-toll system and thought Queensland Motorway had removed the toll.

Bob Jarvis says he would be happy to pay tolls if he could pay them in cash

The 68-year-old says it is his constitutional right to pay via 'gold and silver coin' and he does not understand the electronic payment system or feels safe sharing his credit card details over the phone or online

'I made sure I had plenty of change in my ash tray and I thought "Oh hello, there's no way I can pay this toll, there's no baskets." I was completely unaware of how to pay it,' he told MailOnline.

A short time later he received a 'nasty bill in the mail', which demanded not only the $4 toll, but also a $7.71 administrative fee.

Mr Jarvis called up to complain and eventually paid the money, after deducting the cost of the phone call and postage – sending Queensland Motorways a cheque for 17 cents.

Since then he has continued to refuse to pay tolls via electronic means, insisting he would pay in cash if someone would give him that option.

'I'm certainly not going to give them my credit card details over the phone or pay it online. Blokes in my age group have been warned in the papers and warned all over the place not to give your credit card details to people.

'So I wrote a handwritten, signed and dated letter explaining that I had the money in my hand but there was no way to pay for it – they could come out and collect it from me.'

The Tewanten man has received numerous fines for failing to pay his tolls, each time he writes a handwritten letter in reply explaining his views

Mr Jarvis says he knows his legal rights so well because his father used to make him read the Australian constitution and quiz him on it

Mr Jarvis, who calls himself a 'bush lawyer' said he was quizzed on the Australian Constitution by his father as a child and remembered a clause that, he believes, gives his position legal backing.

'In Chapter Five, section 115 it says: "A State shall not coin money, nor make anything but gold and silver coin a legal tender in payments of debts."

'They kept sending me notices and they got debt collectors onto me and stuff, eventually I said I'm quite happy to go to court about this and I'll just ask the magistrate what part of the constitution don't these toll people understand and I'll explain it to them.'

In September 2012 after numerous letters and fines, some of which escalated to the State Penalties Enforcement Registry (SPER), the Queensland Motorways dropped their case against Mr Jarvis for the fines, despite having listed a hearing date.

Mr Jarvis continued to receive and reply to fines until June last year when they stopped altogether, despite the fact he has travelled on the Gateway Bridge toll road several times since then.

Queensland Motorways were unable to provide specific information relating to Mr Jarvis's case due to privacy laws.

But Queensland Motorways CEO Brendan Bourke told MailOnline: 'Electronic tolling on the Queensland Motorways network is a much safer and more efficient system as it keeps traffic flowing helping to reduce congestion.'

He also added that tolls can be paid by cash at Customer Service Centres in Murarrie and Heathwood, as well as at participating retail stores.

A constitutional expert told MailOnline that Chapter Five, section 115 was instituted to stop states setting up their own currency and that courts regularly dismiss cases such as this one.
