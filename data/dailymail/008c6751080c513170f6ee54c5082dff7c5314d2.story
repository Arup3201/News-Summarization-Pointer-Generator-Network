Jordan Henderson can become one of the great international players if he starts to add more goals to his game, according to England manager Roy Hodgson.

Hodgson believes that the Liverpool midfielder, who takes on Manchester United on Sunday and is tipped to take over the captaincy from Steven Gerrard next season, is only a step away from becoming an exceptional player, with the England manager delighted at Henderson's progress after he was lambasted for picking Henderson for Euro 2012.

Hodgson said: 'His rise has been fairly meteoric as well. It wasn't so long ago that I picked him for Euro 2012 and that decision was vilified. People were saying he wasn't getting into the Liverpool team and he was being described as a waste of money.

'Then he went to the Under-21 tournament a year later and got an awful lot of criticism captaining the England Under-21 team. No-one had a good word to say about him. So his rise has been quite meteoric, even though he's been round a long time.

'It's only the last year that people are starting to say: "Actually, this boy's a good player". This lad has a lot of qualities. And of course I think, as time goes on, the responsibility he's been given at Liverpool now by Brendan will help him. Liverpool's success will rub off on him as well as he's been an important part of it.

'I think we'll see him get better and better and that's what we hope. He ceratinly has enough qualities that I don't think he needs to be hung up on goal-scoring. He'll always be around the national team for the many other qualities he has. If he starts to add goals as well, then you're talking about someone who is exceptional.'

And though Hodgson hopes that Henderson does succeed Steven Gerrard as Liverpool captain, he says it won't make any difference to his role in the England team, where he is already considered one of the senior players.

'If Brendan does make him captain, great and we'll all be happy. If he doesn't it won't affect his leadership qualities as far as I'm concerned. He's in our leadership group. He'll still be someone who needs to take on leadership responsibilities when he comes to England. If he does that, coming as Wayne Rooney does, as captain of his club team, that's great. If he doesn't because Brendan chooses someone else that doesn't affect me.'
