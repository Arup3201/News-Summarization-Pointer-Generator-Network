Frustrated cabbie Kugannesan Balasubramaniam (pictured) had rammed into the back of a classic sports car and killed the driver during the morning rush hour, a court heard

A taxi driver who shunted the back of a classic sports car so hard it 'folded like a penknife' and killed the driver is facing jail.

Kugannesan Balasubramaniam had ploughed his Peugeot van into the back of the 1963 MGB convertible roadster at 48mph on the A40 Westway in London.

The court heard the 31-year-old had become 'frustrated' while driving in traffic shortly before the crash.

Teacher Nick Sennett, who had only hired the classic car for a few days, suffered serious head injuries as his car was shunted forward violently in the four-car crash. 

Paramedics spent an hour trying to save the 58-year-old, who taught economics at Latymer Upper School in Hammersmith, but he was pronounced dead at the scene.

Balasubramaniam had claimed the vintage car had pulled out in front of him suddenly.

But jurors unanimously found the taxi driver guilty of causing death by careless driving, an alternative to the original count of causing death by dangerous driving.

Speaking after Mr Sennett's death chef Heston Blumenthal, who attended the £15,700-a-year school, had said: 'What made Nick stand out was his very calm, playful banter. He was one of those teachers you could be very comfortable around. He was really lovable, really funny, chilled out.'

Judge Jeffrey Pegden QC told Balasubramaniam: 'You will be sentenced at this court for causing death by careless driving on the 15 January next year.

'You should understand that the law makes it clear that a custodial sentence is likely but as you are a man of previous good character I order a pre-sentence report for that day.'

The minicab driver had just collected a sixth-form student from Heathrow Airport and was taking her to an address in northwest London, Southwark Crown Court heard.

Prosecutor Nicholas Bleaney told the court: 'Shortly before the collision she noticed the defendant making a mobile phone call, she thinks the phone was put to his ear rather than using a hands-free system but perhaps more importantly she started to pay attention to what was going on in front of her.

'She noticed that the traffic was building up and first thing in the morning it is by no means unusual for the traffic to build up,' he said.

'She noticed this defendant was starting to get frustrated and slapping the steering wheel with his hands and she then noticed the line of traffic in front of their car and it wasn't clear to her whether it was completely stationary or moving slowly but she noticed around that point that the defendant started to speed up to a speed that would be appropriate to an empty road.

'She simply watched as the defendant drove into a car in front.

'That proved to be Mr Sennett's MGB, he had hired it from a classic car club for a few days and the impact shunted it into the car in front,' added Mr Bleaney.

The force of Balasubramaniam's ramming also shunted cars ahead of the MGB in the four-car crash, jurors heard.

'Essentially it (the MGB) folded like a penknife,' said Mr Bleaney.

'He hit his head on the windscreen top and suffered some chest injuries but the main injury was a very serious head injury and sadly he did not regain consciousness and he was pronounced dead at the scene.'

Balasubramaniam told officers at the scene that the vintage car pulled suddenly in front of him into his braking distance.

Sam Robinson, for Balasubramaniam, said the soft-top roadster had changed lanes and pulled just in front of the minicab at the same time the traffic slowed.

He told jurors: 'Unfortunately at the point that the MG made the manouvere from the middle lane to the outside lane was the point at which the traffic had back up over that hill.

'The stop-start which was going on further up the road had stopped again.

'What was 100 metres of clear road in front of this defendant suddenly became a whole lot less.

'He couldn't stop, he tried as we all would, the result was a terrible accident.'

Although the defendant was speeding, he said it was 'not dangerous if the conditions are right' and dismissed the prosecution case as having 'no physical evidence' showing how fast the vehicle was going.

Balasubramaniam had been driving a replacement vehicle while his own car was at the garage.

A tracking device inside the vehicle recorded the minicab driver was speeding at 48mph on the 40mph road. He was also overworked, having worked 90 hours in the previous seven days for the cab hire company One to One.

Mr Bleaney said: 'It is the prosecution's case that he was over-tired when he was driving and over-tired in circumstances where he had gone into that situation for commercial gain.'

The short-sighted driver also failed a basic number plate-reading eye test when officers attended the scene.

Balasubramaniam, from Wembley, northwest London, denied a single charge of causing death by dangerous driving.

He was convicted by the alternative charge of causing death by careless driving and released on conditional bail ahead of his sentence on January 15.
