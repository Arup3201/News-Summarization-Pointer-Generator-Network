Chelsea continued their unbeaten start to the Premier League season with a confident 2-0 win over Arsenal at Stamford Bridge.

A penalty from Eden Hazard, followed by a deft lob from Diego Costa secured the three points in a game that didn't truly trouble the title favourites.

Find out how the players rated at Stamford Bridge below: 

CHELSEA 

THIBAUT COURTOIS - Concussed when he collided with Alexis Sanchez. Never recovered, substituted after 24 minutes and replaced by Petr Cech. 7 

Thibaut Courtois was only able to play 24 minutes of the match, after a clash with Alexis Sanchez

BRANISLAV IVANOVIC - Thrived in the combat. Inevitably made his way into the book for tripping Sanchez. 7

GARY CAHILL - Classy first half dummy left Sanchez in no-man’s land. Rock solid alongside his captain. 7.5

JOHN TERRY - Chants about Terry’s off-field indiscretions inspire him. This was a colossal performance by Chelsea’s captain. 8

John Terry put in a colossal performance at the heart of Chelsea's defence on Sunday afternoon

CESAR AZPILICUETA - Disciplined and focused in a team that loves to keep clean sheets. This was another and he deserved to be part of it. 6.5

NEMANJA MATIC - Neat and tidy in the centre of midfield, settling in front of Chelsea’s back four whenever they needed him. 6.5

CESC FABREGAS - Didn’t react, at times under huge provocation from Arsenal fans. Those who applauded him yesterday deserve much credit. Lovely chip for Costa’s goal. 7

It was a big day for ex-Gunner Cesc Fabregas, playing against his former side in the blue of Chelsea

ANDRE SCHURRLE - Always a threat when he’s on the ball, but the nagging doubt over the winger is that he’s better when he comes on as a substitute. 6

OSCAR - His movement was top class, eluding defenders and making space for himself. The trouble is that Chelsea didn’t get him on the ball anywhere near enough. 6.5

EDEN HAZARD - Lovely first half, earning Chelsea’s penalty and then putting the ahead from the penalty spot. Sometimes he operates at another level. 7

Eden Hazard opened the scoring with a first-half penalty after he was brought down in the box

DIEGO COSTA - The guy is different class when he has a run on goal. His chest down and finish on the run was first class. Chelsea wanted a goal muncher. They have one. 7.5

SUBSTITUTES:

CECH (Courtois 24) - Composed and calm, he played as though he had never been away. Instant presence in Chelsea’s defence. 7.5

MIKEL (Schurrle 68) - Brought on to help see the game out for Chelsea, did just that. 6

WILLIAN (Oscar 87) - Oscar had just been booked, Mourinho wanted to avoid a potential second yellow card. 6

Subs: Luis, Zouma, Salah, Remy

Booked: Cahill 20, Ivanovic 53, Schurrle 66, Oscar 86 

Scorers: Hazard 27, Costa 78  

ARSENAL 

WOJCIECH SZCZESNY: Beaten by Hazard’s penalty, but didn’t have a great deal to do beyond that. 6.5

CALUM CHAMBERS - Not a great game. Booked early for a foul on Hazard, could easily have been sent off for tripping Schurrle before half time. 5

PER MERTESACKER - Couple of decent interceptions on an afternoon when the Arsenal defender couldn’t take his eyes off Diego Costa. 6.5.

LAURENT KOSCIELNY - Dreadful. Hazard’s mazy run took him past two Arsenal players and then Koscielny chopped him inside the area. Daft, daft, challenge. 4

Laurent Koscielny had a terrible game, pictured lagging behind Diego Costa as he puts Chelsea 2-0 up

KIERAN GIBBS -  Desperate to get forward, but he had Andre Schurrle for company down Arsenal’s left. Still, rarely beaten. 6.5

MATHIEU FLAMINI - Never quite sure whether he was supposed to be tracking Oscar’s runs or leaving it to someone else. Decent enough, without making an impact. 6.5

MESUT OZIL - Improved in the second half with a couple of slinky runs, but this was a long way from his performance at Aston Villa. 6

Mesut Ozil's performance at Stamford Bridge on Sunday was far from his impressive game at Aston Villa

JACK WILSHERE - Superb lob wedge into Alexis Sanchez that sadly led to Courtois’ injury. To his credit, tried to drive his team on. 7

SANTI CAZORLA -Limited impact on the game, he couldn’t keep up with the pace and Arsenal couldn’t get him on the ball enough. Substituted. 5.5

ALEXIS SANCHEZ - Frustrated whenever he sprinted forward, looked round to find to his surprise that he had noone in support. This isn’t how they play at Barcelona. 6.5

DANNY WELBECK - Barely had a kick against two of the toughest central defenders in the Premier League. The very best strikers fined a way whoever their opponents are. Booked for naughty challenge on Fabregas. 5

Danny Welbeck struggled to get into the game, and capped it off with a late, naughty challenge on Fabregas

SUBSTITUTES

OXLADE-CHAMBERLAIN (Cazorla 69) - Sprightly, energetic performance but didn’t get a decent chance. 6

ROSICKY (Wilshere 83) - Nowhere near enough time to get into the game. 6.5

PODOLSKI (Sanchez 79) - Little time to make any impact. 6 

Subs: Martinez, Monreal, Campbell, Coquelin. 

Booked: Chambers 22, Koscielny 27, Welbeck 90+1

Star man: John Terry - 8

Referee: Martin Atkinson - 7

Jose Mourinho: 7.5

Arsene Wenger: 5
