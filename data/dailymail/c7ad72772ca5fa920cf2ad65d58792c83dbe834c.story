The
son of My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding star Paddy Doherty was jailed for
almost four years today after causing the death of a friend in a horrific car
crash following a night out in a pub.

David Doherty was 
also banned from driving for four years after a jury heard how he 
‘wickedly’ fled the scene in front of arriving police officers amid 
claims he was drunk.

Already
disqualified and driving without insurance, Doherty, 27, crashed his 
Mitsubishi Shogun into a Renault van parked in a lay-by off a dual 
carriageway in North Wales in March.

The traveller's front seat passenger James Loveridge, 38, a father of four, was declared dead at the scene.

Four others were hurt, including van driver Victor McClelland, who is still being treated for multiple injuries.

Mr McClelland, who was left in a coma 
for two weeks, had just returned from holiday and, because he was tired,
decided to pull over and sleep in the back of the van.

But Doherty – believing the layby was 
an exit slip road - drove into the back of the vehicle, spinning it 
around, and throwing Mr McClelland out.

The victim landed on the 
dual-carriageway, where it is believed he was run over by another 
vehicle as the driver tried to avoid the crash debris.

Doherty, whose father has been 
involved in several bare-knuckle boxing matches and has recently become a
friend of the House of Commons Speaker's wife Sally Bercow  since they 
appeared together on Celebrity Big Brother, was heard to say: ‘I was 
asleep and woke up to this.’

Danger: Doherty ploughed into Victor McClellan'd van which was parked on a lay-by of the the A55 (pictured) at Talybont, Gwynedd, North Wales

Jailing him for three years and 10 
months at Mold Crown Court, Judge Niclas Parry said: ‘What followed can 
only be described as an act of sheer wickedness in what I consider to be
an entirely separate act of criminality.

‘Knowing what you had done, knowing 
you passenger was dead or dying, or at the very least seriously injured,
you left without any regard for anyone else.

‘You did not stay to call for assistance but you fled the scene.

‘You stole another vehicle, for the 
second time that morning drove while disqualified and without insurance,
in order to avoid detection.

‘It also meant it was not possible for you to be tested for alcohol.’

Doherty - who denies that he was over 
the limit and says he probably mistook the lay-by for a nearby slip road
- admitted causing death by careless driving at 4am on the Westbound 
carriageway of the A55 at Talybont, Gwynedd, on March 18 this year.

He also admitted driving while disqualified, without insurance, failing to stop and failing to report the accident.

Squaring up: Eight men have now admitted their involvement in the violence which erupted as part of a long-standing feud between the groups

He went on to admit driving the 
Land Rover without consent and without insurance together with a separate
incident of dangerous driving in Manchester in May of last year when he
fled at speed from police, together with other motoring offences.

An earlier charge of causing death by dangerous driving was dropped.

Doherty, who lives with his family at the Riverside Traveller’s Park in Queensferry, initially denied being behind the wheel.

But he changed his plea when his DNA 
was found in his blood and saliva on the air bag of the crashed Shogun, 
proving conclusively that he was the driver.

His DNA was also found in the 
Land Rover he stole and fled the scene in, despite his initial claim that
his brother had picked him up and that he had left after a bump to the 
head not realising the seriousness of what had happened.

Mr McClelland had a fractured skull, 
bleeding into the brain, a fractured cheek bone and shoulder, bruised 
chest, lung damage, his pelvis was shattered and he had three fractures 
to his neck.

In a victim impact statement he told how it had been totally life-changing.

Doherty’s passengers Thomas Ward, Paul
Hulse and Mark Evans were also hurt during the trip to Anglesey to Chester, where
they had been in a pub just hours earlier.

Mr Ward had a broken neck, spine damage and would have to spend up to six months in a ‘halo’ frame.

Mr Hulse had a fractured neck and collar bone and other injuries to his knee and hand. Mr Evans had a laceration to his face.

Judge Niclas Parry said that as a 
result of Doherty’s irresponsible driving, a young man was killed, an 
entirely innocent man suffered life-threatening injuries, and three of 
his other passengers were seriously hurt.

He had been in a pub the previous 
evening in Chester, with passengers he drove while disqualified and 
without passengers, and did not think it important enough to have 
sufficient regard for the safety of other road users.

The incident occurred while he was on bail for an earlier allegation of dangerous driving in Manchester.

The case in Mold was also seriously 
aggravated by his previous convictions for dangerous driving, careless 
driving, no insurance and drink driving.

Unlikely pair: After becoming friends on Celebrity Big Brother, Sally Bercow, the wife of the Commons Speaker, went to visit Paddy Doherty at his caravan site home

The judge stressed that no sentence 
was intended to reflect the value of the life lost - a loving partner 
and devoted father of four.

Christopher Harding, defending, said 
that his client was full of remorse for what he had done and the way he 
had behaved after the crash.

The sentencing comes just two weeks 
after he escaped jail over a bare knuckle brawl between feuding families
outside Manchester magistrates’ court.

Joined by brothers John and Simon, 
Doherty had a huge punch up with two other families over another fight 
involving the 53-year old Big Fat Gypsy Weddings star.

During the brawl outside a courthouse 
one of the Doherty’s was heard to shout: ‘What about my f**ing dad’, 
whose ear had been bitten off following a bloody brawl.

The fight broke in May out after brothers 
John and Dougie Joyce appeared before magistrates, accused of attacking 
Paddy Doherty, their cousin.
