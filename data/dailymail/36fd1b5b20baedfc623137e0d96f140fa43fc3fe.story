Claim: Star Scientific claims its Anatabloc product may be useful in the treatment of traumatic brain injuries

A pharmaceutical company that suggested one of its products may be useful in preventing and treating traumatic brain injuries has had its wrists slapped by the U.S Food And Drug Administration (FDA) for misleading the public.

Star Scientific, the company at the heart of a scandal involving the Virginia governor, claimed that its product Anatabloc may help with recovery from brain injury caused, for instance, by concussion.

However, Gary Coody, the FDA’s National Health Fraud Coordinator, said: ‘We're very concerned that false assurances of faster recovery will convince athletes of all ages, coaches and even parents that someone suffering from a concussion is ready to resume activities before they are really ready.’

What’s more, in a warning letter dated December 20, Star Scientific has been told that it does not have permission to market Anatabloc, because it contains anatabine, a new dietary ingredient that needs federal approval to promote – something that the firm has yet to seek.

Star Scientific has been at the center of a scandal involving Virginia Governor Robert McDonnell, a Republican whose term ends next month.

Federal authorities are investigating the relationship between McDonnell and Star Scientific founder and former Chief Executive Jonnie Williams Sr, who sought state help promoting Anatabloc.

McDonnell has acknowledged that he and his family accepted more than $160,000 in gifts and loans from Williams, a major campaign donor. But the governor has said Williams and Star Scientific received no grants or other help from the state.

The FDA warned Star Scientific that its claims about Anatabloc's ability to treat brain injuries were misleading

In July, the governor apologized for embarrassing the state and repaid the loans. He said he returned the gifts to Williams.

Williams resigned last week. He was replaced by Dr Michael Mullan, head of the Roskamp Institute, a research center.

The FDA gave Star Scientific, of Glen Allen, Virginia, 15 days to say what steps it has taken to correct violations.

In a statement on its website, Star said it was responding to the FDA and ‘has already advised the agency that it intends to work cooperatively to resolve these issues’.
