As any online shopper knows, a 'medium' top by one designer can be labelled 'extra small' by another.

Now one Italian fashion start-up is hoping to take the guesswork out of shopping from different brands by using a smart tape to translate sizes.

Dubbed 'On', the 63-inch (160cm) loop of tape will measure users users and then transmit that data via Bluetooth to a smartphone app.

As any online shopper knows, a 'medium' top by one designer can be labelled 'extra small' by another. Now one Italian fashion start-up is hoping to take the guesswork out of shopping from different brands by using a smart tape measure to translate sizes

The tape has been developed by XYZE, which is pronounced 'size', who is currently attempting to raise funds to commercialise the gadget on Indiegogo.

The gadget measures 2.05 x 1.12 x 1.97 inches (52 x 28.5 x 50 mm) and is powered by a three-volt battery that the company claims lasts at least two years.

The accompany app, currently being developed for Android and iOS, will show users the correct way to take measurements.

These measurements are saved in a XYZE ID, which is an algorithm that calculates the best fit for a user based on their size and a brand's sizing.

Dubbed 'On', the 63-inch (160cm) loop of tape claims to accurately measure users and then transmit that data via Bluetooth to a smartphone

Early birds can get the gadget, which has been 18 months in development, for $45 (£29) if they sign up to the Indiegogo campaign. The price then goes up to $67 (£44)

XYZE is hoping retailers will integrate the system into their websites to make it simpler for On users to find their sizes.

The Treviso-based company is now hoping to raise over $68,000 (£44,000) and to start shipping the On in July.

Early birds can get the gadget, which has been 18 months in development, for about $45 (£29). The price then goes up to $67 (£44).

Similar services have previously been offered by companies who have transformed webcams into digital measuring tapes.

For instance, UPcload, a German group, has developed a program that allows a webcam to take measurements with what it claims to be the accuracy of a tailor.

Should you go for the flats or the heels? Is the necklace OTT? Does the colour suit you? Does your bum look big in those super skinny jeans?

If these questions of grave fashion importance have ever popped into your head, you'll be pleased to know you can now get  honest answers to them - and any  similar - on your smartphone in an instant.

New fashion app Okay Fashion allows users to post pictures alongside their style dilemma. Their followers, which consist of fellow Okay Fashion users, cast their vote.

So instead of asking your man or best mate for outfit advice on a Saturday night, you can upload a couple of options on the app and in no time you'll see what percentage of your 'fashion advisers' like which outfit.

The app was first created in France but launched in the UK in October and has also rolled out in 60 other countries
