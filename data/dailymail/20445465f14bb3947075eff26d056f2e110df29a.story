'O’Neill was deployed more than a dozen times and led the military’s best individuals in many high-profile operations, including the hijacking of the Maersk Alabama and Operation Neptune’s Spear.

O'Neill also confirmed the news on Twitter, posting: 'Happy to join the team'.

O'Neill was with his team in Miami for diving training in 2011 when he and a several other senior SEALs got the call to deploy for a special mission.

At first, military officials only gave the team a vague understanding of the mission, leading them to believe they were going to Libya to capture Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi since it was around the time of the Arab Spring.

But eventually it dawned on the team that they could be after a much bigger target, someone who had evaded capture for nearly a decade.

The team was trained for the mission on a replica of the Abbottabad compound where it was believed bin Laden was hiding.

O'Neill called the team the 'Martyr's brigade' and that nearly everyone wrote letters home to their family, believing they wouldn't be coming home.
