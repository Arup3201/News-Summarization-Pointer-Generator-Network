Britain’s tourism industry appears to be taking a slight hit as Russian visitors are less willing to travel and spend money on hotels and shops thanks to the sliding rouble.

Tourists from the beleaguered European nation spent 28 per cent less in the UK in 2014 than they did in 2013, according to a study by Global Blue, a tax-free shopping firm based in Switzerland.

London is a popular destination for Russians but foreign spending is now twice as expensive for them with the rouble losing almost 50 per cent of its value.

With its economy nearing a possible recession Russia’s currency has plummeted amid the ongoing conflict in eastern Ukraine, sanctions imposed by Europe and the US, and slumping oil prices.

Global Blue said Russians were previously among the five biggest-spending non-EU tourists in the UK but they have fallen out of the top ten.

The European Travel Commission is predicting that Russian outbound tourism will continue to decline in 2015.

Meanwhile, Middle Eastern nations continued to see growth with Qatari shoppers spending 16 per cent more and Kuwaiti spending increasing by seven per cent.

Visitors from Qatar spent an average of £1,406 per transaction thanks to their taste for luxury brands, said the study.

Spending by tourists from Hong Kong increased by nine per cent, while Chinese travellers spent six per cent more than they did in 2013.

Visitors from China were the biggest spenders in the UK last year, accounting for 25 per cent of the total international spend.

However, overall spending was down three per cent from 2013 to 2014 despite record spending in December.

Visitors spent 11 per cent more over the festive period in 2014 compared with the same month a year earlier, said Global Blue.

Gordon Clark, Global Blue’s UK country manager, said: ‘2014 was a turning point for how Christmas is a key period for international spend, a trend which we expect to continue.

Overall tax-free spending at hotels and shops was down three per cent from 2013 to 2014, said Global Blue

‘Unlike domestic, globe shoppers are not simply drawn by the heavy discounts but also by the added benefit of shopping these discounted goods tax free in the UK, at a time when the streets are festively decorated to look their best.

‘In what has been a slower year for international spend, it is encouraging for retailers to see strength over this period.’

Looking ahead, VisitBritain is predicting that 2014’s decline will be offset in 2015 as holidaymakers spend more in the UK.

Tourism bosses are expecting a total spend of £22.2bn, a year-over-year increase of 4.5 per cent.
