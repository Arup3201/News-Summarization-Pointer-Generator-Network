A 22-year-old man has been arrested after allegedly leaving a doll outside a Florida courthouse - sparking a bomb scare and resulting in the immediate evacuation of the building.

Tyler Long was detained after a surveillance video captured a young man approaching the platform of a flagpole outside the Alto Lee Adams Sr. United States Courthouse in Fort Pierce on January 6.

Footage appears to show the man, dressed in black and wearing a backpack, climbing onto the platform, before placing an object at the base of the pole. He then runs down the courthouse steps.

Arrest: Tyler Long, 22, has been arrested after allegedly leaving a doll outside the Alto Lee Adams Sr. United States Courthouse in Florida - sparking a bomb scare and resulting in the immediate evacuation of the building

'Creepy': During an interview with police, Long reportedly told officers that thought it would be amusing to leave the 'creepy' doll at the base of a flagpole (pictured) outside the Fort Pierce courthouse to scare someone

After a witness alerted the police, officers rushed to the scene. They quickly identified the item as a baby doll, before ordering an evacuation of the courthouse and calling a bomb unit to the building.

But despite officers' fears, the doll was later found to not contain any explosives.

On Thursday, Long was arrested and charged with disorderly conduct, according to WPTV. His arrest was largely based on images of the suspect at the scene taken by a witness. 

During an interview with police, Long reportedly told officers that he found the 'creepy' doll beside a fence and thought it would be amusing to leave it outside the courthouse to scare someone.
