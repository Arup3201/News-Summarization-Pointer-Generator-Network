Deal: Sgt. Robert Bales' lawyer said that he will be pleading guilty in an effort to avoid the death penalty, which the U.S. Army was seeking in his case after he reportedly killed 16 Afghan villagers in a predawn rampage in March

The Army staff sergeant charged with slaughtering 16 villagers during one of the worst atrocities of the Afghanistan war has agreed to plead guilty in a deal to avoid the death penalty.

Staff Sgt. Robert Bales is scheduled to enter guilty pleas to charges of premeditated murder June 5 at Joint Base Lewis-McChord south of Seattle, his lawyer John Henry Browne told The Associated Press on Wednesday.

A sentencing-phase trial set for September will determine whether he is sentenced to life in prison with or life without the possibility of parole.

The judge and commanding general must approve a plea deal.

Browne previously indicated Bales remembered little from the night of the massacre, but he said the soldier will give a full account of what happened before the judge decides whether to accept the plea.

In earlier interviews, Bales' lawyer argues that the Army was pushing the possibility of the death penalty.

'The Army is not taking 
responsibility for Sgt. Bales and other soldiers that the Army knowingly
sends into combat situations with diagnosed PTSD, concussive head 
injuries and other injuries,' Browne said.

'The
Army is trying to take the focus off the failure of its decisions, and 
the failure of the war itself, and making Sgt. Bales out to be a rogue 
soldier.'

Bales, an Ohio native and father of two, slipped away from his remote southern Afghanistan outpost at Camp Belambay early on March 11, 2012, and attacked Afghan compounds in two slumbering villages nearby.

Most of the victims were women and children, and some of the bodies were piled and burned.

The slayings drew such angry protests that the U.S. temporarily halted combat operations in Afghanistan.

Bales was serving his fourth tour in a combat zone, and the allegations against him raised questions about the toll multiple deployments were taking on American troops.

For that reason, many legal experts believed it that it was unlikely that he would receive the death penalty, as Army prosecutors were seeking.

Adding to that, the military justice system hasn't executed anyone since 1961.

The plea deal could inflame tensions in Afghanistan as relatives of the victims in Kandahar became outraged at the notion Bales might escape the death penalty and even vowed revenge.

'For this one thing, we would kill 100 American soldiers,' said Mohammed Wazir, who had 11 family members killed that night, including his mother and 2-year-old daughter.

'A prison sentence doesn't mean anything,' said Said Jan, whose wife and three other relatives died.

'I know we have no power now. But I will become stronger, and if he does not hang, I will have my revenge.'

Three of Jan's other family members were wounded, including his 7-year-old granddaughter, who was shot in the head.

Bales' wife, Kari Bales, said in a 
statement Wednesday that she and their children have been enjoying their
weekend visits with Bales at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, and she hopes he
receives an impartial trial.

'I no longer know if a fair trial for Bob is possible, but it very much is my hope, and I will have faith,' she said.
