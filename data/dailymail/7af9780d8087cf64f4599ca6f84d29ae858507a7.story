They may be a hallmark of a galaxy far, far away, but sci-fi deflector shields similar to those in the Star Wars films could one day become a reality, according to a scientific paper.

The technology - which in the blockbusting films protects pilots including Luke Skywalker, Han Solo and Darth Vader from enemy laser fire - is in fact scientifically possible, a theoretical study says.

Indeed the research, published by physicists from the University of Leicester, claims that the raw materials already exist to create the shield, fuelled by powerful magnets, which in the films protects ships like the X-Wing and TIE fighters from powerful laser blasts.

Shields: The the Star Wars films, spacecraft like those pictured are protected by deflector shields. A scientific paper has suggested the technology is theoretically possible

Dogfights: The shields are used by spaceships including X-Wings and TIE Fighters (pictured above). Physicists from the Unviersity of Leicester speculated that a shell of superheated plasma could defend from laser fire

However - as the study admits - the results would not be precisely as seen on the silver screen, as the shields would make it impossible to see out of the starfighters, and would also make it difficult to fire any weaponry in return.

In a paper for university publication Journal of Special Physics Topics, three fourth-year physics students at Leicester show that a sufficiently powerful magnet - the likes of which are already used in medical technology - could sustain a shield which could block laser fire.

The scientists - Alexander Toohie, Joseph Macguire and Alexandra Pohl - also point out that the type of shield they proposed already exists in the upper reaches of the Earth's atmosphere.

Their paper proposes that a replica deflector shield could be created by holding a shell of plasma - super-heated particles charged with electricity - in place with a magnetic field.

Calculations in the paper show that a sufficiently dense field to block Star Wars lasers - which are intense blasts of visible light - could be produced by a magnetic field of five Tesla - a unit of magnetic strength.

Magnets of up to 3 Tesla are used in MRI scanners, and magnets as strong as 60 Tesla are used for research.

A layer of plasma - which acts as a shield - already exists around the Earth, and helps protect the planet from debris and radiation from space.

Long-distance radio operators already use the phenomenon to 'bounce' radio signals off of the inside of the so-called 'ionosphere' shield to communicate with devices farther than the horizon.

The paper does acknowledge that a very large power source would be needed to sustain the shield, which might make it impractical for a small spaceship like an X-Wing. The temperature of the plasma layer - around 750C - could also present problems.

However, they suggested the lack of visibility could be overcome by using an ultra-violet camera, which would allow pilots to see the outside world using frequencies outside of the range of the shield.

Alexander Toohie, one of the authors, told science website Phys.org: 'The Earth's atmosphere is made up of several distinct layers, one of which is the ionosphere.

'The ionosphere is a plasma, and extends from roughly 50km above the surface of the Earth to the edge of space. Just like the plasma described in our paper, it reflects certain frequencies of electromagnetic radiation, in this case radio frequencies.'

And even though the technology may not have great military uses, it could be useful for containing dangerous amounts of energy - for example in nuclear reactions.

Mr Toohie continued: 'Another possible application of this principle may be for trapping radiation inside a shell of plasma rather than excluding it. This may be useful for applications that require incredibly high temperature environments, such as experimental fusion reactors.'

The timely piece of research comes as 
filming gets underway for the seventh Star Wars film, the cast for which
 was announced this week.

On Tuesday Disney and Lucasfilm confirmed on the official Star Wars
 website that Girls star Adam Driver would take a part in the relaunched
 film as well as newcomers John Boyega and Daisy Ridley. Oscar Isaac, Andy Serkis, Domhnall Gleeson and Max von Sydow were also listed as cast members.

It was also confirmed that stars of the original trilogy - Harrison
 Ford, Carrie Fisher, Mark Hamill, Anthony Daniels, Peter Mayhew and 
Kenny Baker - would also be in the film, which will be directed by JJ 
Abrams and released in 2015.

The movie will hit theatres on December 18, 2015.
