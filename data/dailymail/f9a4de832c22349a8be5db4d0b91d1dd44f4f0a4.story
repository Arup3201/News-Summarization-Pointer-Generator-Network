In the first of a new weekly column, Chief Sports Writer Martin Samuel gives his verdict on the footballing issues of the week, saying what made him feel warm inside and what made him shiver...

HOT

Bayern Munich

Bayern Munich are currently gaining 0.5 points more each week than any rival in the Bundesliga, meaning they are on course to be crowned champions before the end of April. Last season, they had it won by March. Are they slipping? Not if you saw events at the Stadio Olimpico on Tuesday.

Roma looked good against Manchester City didn’t they? Ashley Cole played like the best English left back, still. Leighton Baines, Luke Shaw, Kieran Gibbs? Ashley was in a different class. But did you see the poor old soul by the time Arjen Robben had finished with him on Tuesday? He looked like he’d just been told Cheryl wanted him back.

Bayern were 5-0 up at half-time when Cole was withdrawn by coach Rudi Garcia on compassionate grounds. And this is a Munich team that lost Toni Kroos, their midfield heartbeat, to Real Madrid in the summer, remember. Later, they were granted an audience with Pope Francis at the Vatican: as if Pep Guardiola needs help from on high.

The Rabona

You see it in real time and you’re not sure. You watch the action replay and, well, now I’m confused. Was that what I thought it was? Did he? And after the second replay – he did, you know. It was a rabona. Erik Lamela scored for Tottenham Hotspur against Asteras Tripolis from just outside the penalty area: with a 36 mph rabona.

What’s a rabona? It’s a shot or cross in which the kicking leg is wrapped behind the standing leg: effectively a crossed leg kick. 

Erik Lamela scores his amazing 'rabona' goal for Tottenham on Thursday night

Rabona is a Spanish word meaning to skip school, and is named after Ricardo Infante, a striker for Argentina and Estudiantes, who scored from 35 yards using this method against Rosario in 1948. The following week the football magazine El Grafico produced a front cover playing on Infante’s surname (which translates as ‘child’) with the playing dressed as a schoolboy and the headline El infante que se hizo la rabona (the child plays hooky). The rabona was born.

Maurico Pochettino, the Tottenham coach, later lavished praise on Lamela but appeared distinctly stone-faced at the time: probably because he knew the nightmare that awaited him at the next training ground shooting drill.

Steve McClaren

During the match between Liverpool and Real Madrid an email dropped in What’s Hot’s in-tray from two people with a very keen sense of priorities. Eschewing any desire to see Cristiano Ronaldo score one of the greatest goals in the history of European nights at Anfield, Sid and Doris Bonkers (not their real name) wanted to know why the Daily Mail continued to give more column inches to Nottingham Forest, at the expense of their beloved Derby County.

They were particularly unhappy that on the night Derby went top of the league their team was allocated space equivalent to the round-up from Catford dogs.

Usually, What’s Hot has a standard response to complaints of this nature – he sends the boys round – but on this occasion, they had a point. Derby are top of the Championship and Steve McClaren, their coach, is doing an outstanding job. 

As mention of McClaren’s name is usually the cue for fans to pick up flaming torches and attack the owner’s Roller, Derby deserve credit for giving McClaren the break he deserved. It might not have felt that way at the time, but not making it through the play-off final was quite the stroke of luck. It has given a young team time to grow. Queens Park Rangers might be regretting that late Bobby Zamora goal too, considering recent events. Which brings us to...

WHAT’S NOT

Adel Taarabt’s Six-Pack

After Harry Redknapp questioned his fitness, noted Queens Park Rangers reserve Adel Taarabt conducted a round of interviews displaying his fine physique. 

Redknapp gave the impression Taarabt looked like this:

This is how Harry Redknapp said Adel Taarabt looked

While Taarabt thought he looked more like this:

Taarabt seemed to think he looked more like the Incredible Hulk

The reality, as you can see, is that he looks like this.

While a properly ripped footballer looks like this.

This is a properly ripped footballer (and not a bad one, too) Cristiano Ronaldo

All of which makes Taarabt and QPR seem a bit like this.

It's all left QPR and Taarabt looking a bit Mickey Mouse

Alex Horne

The tiny violins were out this week for the departure of Football Association general secretary, Alex Horne, a man whose title says all you need to know about his dynamism. Horne used to be the chief executive. But then it was considered having a general secretary might curry favour with UEFA and FIFA because they also had one. So Horne became that instead.

Apart from a key role in moving the FA Cup final to a kick-off time that makes the match inaccessible to anybody residing north of Stanmore, establishing Burton Albion’s training ground and overseeing a national football stadium so popular it may need bailing out by the Denver Broncos, Horne will mainly be remembered as the man who said Roy Hodgson had done enough to keep his job as England manager just by getting to the World Cup. This statement made turning up something of an irrelevance, a fact later confirmed by results.

Horne was not a high-profile figure and to those still unsure of his identity, here is a memory jogger: at press conferences, he was the one who sat on the far right of the group of four and never got asked a question. He will be missed.

Not hot, never hot - Rape 

Now don’t get What’s Not wrong, if you are currently engaged in a game of ‘Nazi stormtrooper and the lonely Russian peasant girl’ with your partner, he’s not judging. Knock yourselves out. Seriously, he means that. As long as everyone’s into it, What’s Not admires the effort in sourcing the costumery alone. On you go. But if you are one of the brigade at Sheffield United currently chanting Ched Evans' name as if he is some kind of returning hero, you may need to take a long look at yourself.

Perhaps at the people around you, too. Their faces, their voices, their personalities. Try to achieve a basic human empathy. Because, even if you believe Evans is innocent, the best that can be said is he treated another human being with such crass contempt and mercilessness that it bordered on criminal. So either it’s rape or it’s the most horrid cruelty. Yet still no apology, even for that. So he’s no hero, no victim and no role model. And there really are better songs to sing. Join in on the chorus of this, if you like. See you next week.
