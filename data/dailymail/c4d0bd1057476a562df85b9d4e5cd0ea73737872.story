A two-timing carpenter who rose to notoriety after building totem poles for a Princess Diana memorial park has admitted that he crushed his wife with one of his creations so he could start a new life with his mistress.

Carl Muggli, 51, entered a guilty plea in an International Falls, Minnesota, court yesterday in the November 2010 death of wife Linda Muggli, who died under the weight of a massive totem pole.

Muggli had originally claimed that the 17-foot totem pole fell on his wife by accident while his back was turned

Together: Carl Muggli admitted on Wednesday that he killed wife Linda by dropping a 2,900-pound wooden pole on her as they carved it together at their country home

But his story began to unravel when an anonymous tipster came forward with 'intimate' Facebook messages that Muggle had exchanged with a woman in Alabama in the days before and after his wife's death.

In the string of messages, he tells the 
mistress - who has only been identified as 'MLG' - that he loved her and wanted to
 move in with her.

And on the day before the murder, he 
wrote to the other woman: 'I want us together to live our lives as we seek... I am yours. We are one!'

Other correspondences found on Muggli's computer showed that he was looking to buy or lease a house in Texas to share with the woman.

Police were also skeptical of Muggli's story when their attempts to recreate the 'accident' were unsuccessful.

Five times the detectives arranged 
the pole in the way that Muggli had said, but they could not get it to 
fall in the way that he claimed.

They
 also found that the totem pole in question had been 'stained or 
polyurethane-coated,' implying that there was an attempt to cover up 
evidence.

After his guilty plea was entered, Muggli's attorney, Charles Hawkins, told Minnesota's Star Tribune newspaper: 'This whole thing is a tragic occurrence... He did not want to put the family, his family or himself through any more misery.'

He will be sentenced on February 4.

Muggli and his wife, who was 61 when she died, became famous for carving three totem poles that were used in the Indian Village section of Princess Diana's Memorial Children's Park in Kensington Gardens, London.

They had been working together on the carvings since 1990 on their property just outside Voyageurs National Park, in Ray, Minnesota.

Their totem poles ranged from 16 feet to 50 feet tall.

According to a complaint filed by the Koochiching County Attorney, police arrived on the scene to find the giant carving across her chest and blood pouring from underneath her.

She was taken to a nearby hospital but died of her injuries on November 26, 2010.

In an interview with reporters soon after Muggli claimed: 'The totem we were working on was progressing wonderful.

'I mean, it was just coming really good, and we were laughing and joking and having a great conversation, just…and then it was over.'

Muggli was arrested in Stockdale, 
Texas, about seven months after Linda Muggli's death, and was later 
extradited back to Minnesota.

It is not clear if he was living with his mistress at the time.

Their
 Native Veterans Totem, honoring American Indians who served in the 
military, stands outside the Veterans Administration hospital in 
Brockton, Massachusetts.

There is also a Muggli totem pole outside Chalet Geronimo in the French Alps.
