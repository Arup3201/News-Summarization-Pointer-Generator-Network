Two British holidaymakers have appeared in court after a third died following a brawl by a hotel pool in Spain.

George Smith, 41, and Jane McCabe, 35, were arrested on suspicion of manslaughter following the late-night bust-up in Lanzarote.

Alan Atkinson, 48, died after allegedly being struck over the head with a rock at around 2.30am on Saturday.

He was taken conscious to hospital but died later from his injuries.

A spokesman for the Civil Guard, 
investigating, said: 'Witnesses said there was a big brawl by the hotel 
pool involving three Britons.

'A number of objects were used as weapons. One man was taken to hospital but later died from his injuries.

'A British man and woman were 
arrested at the scene on suspicion of manslaughter. We are investigating
the relationship between the three people.

'Initial investigations suggest the 
victim died from head injuries inflicted during the fight, but a 
post-mortem examination will give the exact cause of death.

'We are investigating whether the victim was struck on the head with a rock.'

Mr Smith and Ms McCabe appeared at a
behind-closed doors hearing before an investigating magistrate in the 
island's capital Arrecife yesterday/on Sunday.

They have not been charged with any offence.

Mr Atkinson was reportedly with his partner when a fight broke out with another couple.

Officers at the scene initially 
thought Mr Atkinson had suffered only minor injuries in the brawl at the
three-star Blue Sea Los Fiscos hotel in Puerto del Carmen.

A spokeswoman for the ambulance 
service said he was still conscious when he arrived at the Doctor Jose 
Molina Orosa hospital on the island.

The Foreign Office said: 'We are aware 
of the death of a British national in Lanzarote. We have informed next 
of kin and are offering consular assistance.

'We are also aware of the arrests of two British nationals and we are providing them with consular assistance.'

Mr
Atkinson was taken unconscious by ambulance to the Doctor Jose Molina 
Orosa hospital in Arrecife but doctors were not able to save his life.
