A baby died of whooping cough after doctors failed to diagnose it despite a nationwide campaign among GPs to raise awareness of the symptoms.

Sarae Thompson-Haynes – who was just five weeks old – had been seen at two clinics and a hospital without being tested for the illness.

She is one of five babies to have died as a result of whooping cough this year. The tragedy came two months after GPs were issued with a Health Protection Agency alert warning that cases had doubled in a year.

Tragic: Doctors failed to diagnose baby Sarae Thompson-Haynes with whooping cough despite a nationwide campaign to publicise the symptoms

Yesterday Sarae’s parents, Chelsea Thompson and Todd Haynes, said she might still be alive had tests happened more quickly.

Their daughter was born on February 11. At a month old she developed a cough, so they took her to the Hawthorn Drive Surgery in Ipswich where, they say, doctors assured them she was fine.

When her condition worsened that evening, her family took Sarae to a nearby out-of-hours GP service, Riverside Clinic. There, they say, a doctor again reassured them all was OK, giving them an inhaler for the baby.

The parents claim neither clinic tested for whooping cough.

The following day, after Sarae’s condition deteriorated further, Miss Thompson phoned NHS Direct and was advised to go to A&E.

She took her daughter to Ipswich Hospital where doctors said she might have bronchitis. She was kept in but the parents say she again was not tested for whooping cough.

Sarae's mother said her baby daughter's death had left her 'angry and devastated'

Two days later, on March 18, Sarae experienced breathing difficulties and was transferred to Addenbrooke’s Hospital, Cambridge, where tests were finally carried out. She was then referred to Great Ormond Street Hospital in London, where she died on March 21. Test results – which came back after her death – revealed she had been suffering from whooping cough and had succumbed to related health issues.

Miss Thompson, 21, said she felt let down by the NHS. ‘We are angry and devastated,’ she said.

‘When I found out she died of whooping cough, I did my own research and realised that there was a massive outbreak this year.

‘I also found out that GPs can test for it. Had they done tests earlier, there is a chance that my little girl would still be here today. They all treated me like a young mother who didn’t know what she was talking about.’

Miss Thompson, who lives in Ipswich 
with Mr Haynes, 23, is calling for pregnant women to be immunised 
against the infection. The couple plan to make formal complaints to the 
clinics and hospitals involved.

The HPA says there have been 2,466 cases
of whooping cough in the first six months of this year, already twice 
as many as the whole of last year.

The condition is an infection of the lining of the airways.

The main symptom is a hacking cough followed by a sharp intake of air which sounds like a 'whoop.'

Other symptoms include a runny nose, raised temperature, severe coughing fits and vomiting after coughing

The condition usually affects babies and young children. In rare cases it can be fatal

Children are vaccinated against the infection at two, three and four months of age.

It can be treated successfully with antibiotics and most people make a full recovery.

Reported
cases of whooping cough in England and Wales this year are already 
double what they were in 2011, according to the Health Protection 
Agency.

Sarae's cause of death, as recorded 
on the death certificate, was noted as cardiac failure and severe 
sepsis, as well as pertussis pneumonia.

The
Practice Manager of Hawthorn Drive GP surgery said: 'The whole team at 
the surgery offer their sympathies to the parents and family.

'Our
duty to protect patient confidentiality means we cannot comment on 
individual cases but rest assured we at The Hawthorn Drive GP surgery 
are committed to offering the best level of care to all our patients.

'We would urge the family to contact us if they need our support or help at this tragic time.'

An Ipswich Hospital spokeswoman said: 'We are very saddened by baby Sarae's death.

'The
family have not been in touch with us to date and we urge them to do so
as soon as possible so that we can talk about and look into all the 
areas of concern.'

Dr 
David Lee, Regional Medical Director for Harmoni, also added his 
condolences and said patient confidentiality prevented them commenting 
further.
