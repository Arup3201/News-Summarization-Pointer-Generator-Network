Queensland's police commissioner says he has information an improvised explosive device (IED) is involved in the hostage drama in central Sydney.

Ian Stewart has told the Queensland government that information was 'firming up' that an IED is involved in the siege in Sydney, which is in New South Wales state.

Mr Stewart has also told the government there is no imminent local threat in Queensland, although extra police have been ordered onto Queensland streets as a precaution.

'The action that we've taken though is to reassure the public that Queensland is being adequately policed,' Mr Stewart told state cabinet on Monday.

'We have ordered as many police onto the streets as possible this morning. We've also upgraded the security for this (executive) building again, just until we know what's happening down in Sydney.'

Up to 50 people are believed to have been taken hostage at the Lindt Chocolat Cafe, where an Islamic flag has been pressed up against a window.

At least one man who is believed to be armed with a gun, a machete and possibly explosives is behind the hostage crisis, but NSW police have not confirmed any details of the suspects or possible weapons being used.

Mr Stewart said he'd been in touch with NSW Police Commissioner Andrew Scipione to offer support.

A national phone hook-up of state and federal security authorities was held after the cabinet briefing.

Mr Stewart also revealed there was an 'ever so slight' connection between two men arrested on suspicion of terror-related offences in Sydney earlier on Monday and those arrested in raids in Queensland in September.
