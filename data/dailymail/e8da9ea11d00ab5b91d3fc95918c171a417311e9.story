The weather outside may be miserable but Gok Wan is hoping to brighten up our wardrobes and banish the winter blues with his new collection for Tu at Sainsbury's.

Gok's Spring 2014 range, which is his eleventh for the supermarket giant, promises to ooze femininity and embody all the qualities Gok believes a woman's wardrobe should reflect: ease, comfort, style and power.

Gok has focused on separates this season and hopes his new range of bow wrap dresses and polka dot twinsets can be worn from desk to dance floor.

New range: Gok Wan has unveiled his ultra 
feminine eleventh range for Tu at Sainsbury's. Left, soft peplum top, 
£22, jacquard trouser, £30, right, jacquard dress £40

Gok says that the 22-piece collection, which is available in sizes 8-22, offers beautiful basics that are made to last, as well as elegant eveningwear that is sure to impress. 

Highlights include a soft cocoon cardigan, which can be used to achieve that on-trend layered look spotted at Burberry yesterday, classic skinny jeans and flattering wrap dresses.

Curve enhancing: Gok hopes that his new range will help flatter women of all shapes and he has used his expert tailoring to ensure that (left, soft peplum top, £22, textured ponte peplum hem, £30, right, printed bow wrap dress, £40)

Gok has introduced bow collar tops 
this season, which he hopes will add a touch of sophistication and look 
just as good in the office as it does for a glam night out.

With
 a nod to this season's pretty pastel trend, which looks set to be a 
staple until autumn if the AW14 catwalks are anything to go by, Gok has 
combined rose pink hues with delicate whites and muted mocha tones to 
create a fresh spring-time palette.

In
 true Gok style, the range, which lands in store on February 25, is full
 of his clever tailoring tricks and body-enhancing solutions.

Casual comfort: As well as glamorous dresses, Gok has ensured that there is comfortable and stylish everyday wear such as this cable jumper and skinny jean combo, both £28

Catwalk looks: Gok took inspiration from the catwalks and has introduced sharp tailoring and muted tones (left, bow wrap top, £25, jacquard trouser £30, right, trench coat, £65)

A peplum skirt and jacquard dress feature an inner control slip, which he promises will create a slender silhouette that flatters your figure.

James Brown, Director of Tu Clothing, said: 'The Gok for Tu range has been a fantastic partnership for us 
over the past two years and continues to go from strength to strength.

'This year we’ve been selling one piece of the collection every 14 seconds.

'Gok’s
 philosophy of empowering women by creating beautiful, flattering 
clothes that inspire confidence resonates perfectly with our customers.'
