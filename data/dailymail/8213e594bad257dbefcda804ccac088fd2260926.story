Millions of public sector workers are already allowed to take more time off if they become unwell on holiday

Millions of public sector workers are already allowed to take more time off  if they become unwell on holiday – a privilege that is currently denied to workers in the private sector.

An investigation by The Mail on Sunday has revealed that the entitlement is written into employee contracts in the civil service, NHS trusts and local authorities.

These staff can call in from annual leave, tell their boss that they are sick and claim more holiday to make up the lost time.

The right is set to be incorporated into
British law for all employees later in the year after a ruling by a 
European court, though Business Secretary Vince Cable last week said he 
will do all he can to resist the move.

Documents
uncovered by the investigation show that the entitlement, which  has 
been described by employment  lawyers as a potential ‘malingerers’  
charter’, is commonly written into public sector staff agreements.

When contacted by The Mail  on Sunday, public bodies were unable to say how many extra days off had been taken under the rule, claiming that the information was not recorded.

Instructions issued by the organisation 
of local government employers say workers who are sick while on holiday 
have the right ‘to take that annual leave at another time when they are 
well, even .  .  . in the next leave year’.

Opposed: Vince Cable is fighting the EU ruling but it already applies to his own department

The instructions also say that staff who are off work due to illness can go on holiday while they are still signed off, otherwise employers are ‘at risk of unlawfully discriminating against workers’.

Town hall workers who fall ill on holiday can obtain the time back by filling in a self-certification form. They are obliged to produce a doctor’s certificate only if their illness lasts longer than seven days, according to the Local Government Association.

However, some health authorities say their staff need to produce a medical certificate to back up a claim.

A Cabinet Office spokesman said of civil service employees: ‘The rule certainly applies across Whitehall but we don’t know the extent of it.’

Private sector staff are treated differently because the European court ruling that gave rise to the benefit is not yet incorporated into UK law.

Organisations in the state  sector, however, have already changed their employment practices to reflect the judgment, which was handed down by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in 2009.

A worker in Spain, Vicente Pereda, sued his firm after he was refused permission to change his holiday when he fell ill just before the start. Mr Pereda was ill for all but two days of his fortnight off.

The ECJ ruled in his favour. The EU directive which followed the ruling was immediately legally binding on public bodies.

Ministers say an EU deadline obliges them to introduce the new regime to all workers from October. But Mr Cable, whose own civil servants can claim the benefit, last week said he would resist any attempt to incorporate it into UK law.

Employment experts say they have recently started receiving more inquiries from private  sector firms about how the rule should be applied, suggesting that workers are becoming increasingly aware of its existence.

Taxpayers’ Alliance chief executive Matthew Elliott said: ‘Taxpayers will be fuming if civil servants get extra days off. Most people don’t expect an extra day off if they fall ill at weekends. A holiday should not be any different.’

A Cabinet Office spokesman said: ‘Civil servants must comply with strict rules on reporting sickness absence and providing medical evidence. They cannot retrospectively ask for annual leave to be treated as sickness absence.’
