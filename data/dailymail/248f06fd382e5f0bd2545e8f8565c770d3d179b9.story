The flamboyant multimillionaire who said he would be forced to lay off some or all of his 8,000 employees if Barack Obama was reelected hasn't followed through with his threat.

Instead, David Siegel says he gave all of his workers a raise this week, to help them cope with new taxes and regulations that he believes the president will heap on in his second term.

Mr Siegel, a Florida real estate and timeshare magnate, is perhaps known for his ambitious attempts to build the largest house in the world outside Orland, Florida.

Modeled after the Palace of Versailles in France, he hopes it will be worth $100million when it's completed.

The founder of Westgate Resorts wasn't the only business owner reeling from the loss of Republican Mitt Romney on Tuesday night.

A man claiming to own a business that employs 114 people in Nevada called into a CBS radio show and said he laid off 22 of his workers on Wednesday -- a preemptive move because he fears an economic downturn and more regulation.

In Bedford, Virginia, Lyons Jewelers posted a massive sign in the store window saying: 'Closed to mourn the loss of the America that our forefathers endowed to us.'

WDBJ-TV reports that the store also had a sign that said 'Shame on the U.S. and Virginia' and one that read 'Lyons will reopen tomorrow to continue the fight against a president who seeks my demise.'

The president won the battleground state by about 112,000 votes.

Mr Siegel emailed all his employees last month claiming that Mr Obama would introduce new taxes, which would force him to downsize -- or even retire.

The day after President Barack Obama won the election, a man who claimed to own a business in Las Vegas called into a local radio station to announce he had fired 20 per cent of his staff.

The man, who called a talk radio program on KXNT, gave his name only as 'Dave' and said 'elections have consequences.'

He claimed that Tuesday night's victory for the Democratic president was the tipping point for him to decide that he needed to cut back his business to save money.

He said that he had 114 employees and that he sacked 22 of them.

“I explained to them a month ago that if Obama gets in office that the regulations for Obamacare are gonna hurt our business, and I’m gonna have to make provisions to make sure I have enough money to cover the payroll taxes, the additional health care I’m gonna have to do, and I explained that to them and I said you do what you feel like in your heart you need to do, but I’m just letting you know as a warning this is things I have to think of as a business owner,' he said.

Obama handily beat Republican Mitt Romney in the election and also won the state of Nevada.

'I can’t wait around anymore, I have to be proactive. I had to lay off 22 people today to make sure that my business is gonna thrive and I’m gonna be around for years to come,' he said.

'I have to build up that nest egg now for the taxes and regulations that are coming my way. Elections do have consequences, but so do choices.'

The property magnate's 1,400-word rant was largely copied from a chain email which circulated around the time of the 2008 presidential election.

Mr Siegel told Bloomberg BusinessWeek on Wednesday, the day after the election, that he hadn't laid off anyone -- yet.

'I’m going to work my hardest to keep the company going and expand the best I can. We’ll see what happens,' he said.

He added that he had given all employees in his company a raise, at least five percent, to 'help them handle the additional burdens the government will put on them.'

Last month, Mr Siegel told his workers that the company was performing well, saying: 'The economy doesn't currently pose a threat to your job.

'What
does threaten your job however, is another 4 years of the same 
Presidential administration. Of course, as your employer, I can't tell 
you whom to vote for, and I certainly wouldn't interfere with your right
to vote for whomever you choose. In fact, I encourage you to vote for 
whomever you think will serve your interests the best.'

He added: 'So where am I going with all this? It's quite simple. If any new taxes are levied on me, or my 
company, as our current President plans, I will have no choice but to 
reduce the size of this company.

'Rather
than grow this company I will be forced to cut back. This means fewer 
jobs, less benefits and certainly less opportunity for everyone.

'So,
when you make your decision to vote, ask yourself, which candidate 
understands the economics of business ownership and who doesn't? Whose 
policies will endanger your job?

'Answer those questions and you should know who might be the one capable of protecting and saving your job.'

The 77-year-old starred alongside his wife Jackie, 46, in a documentary film titled 'Queen of Versailles,' chronicling the construction of the 30-bedroom house and the struggles of Mr Siegel's company during the financial crisis and recession.

The flamboyant businessman has previously boasted of using his employees for political ends.

He apparently surveyed his 8,000 workers before the 2000 election, and encouraged only those who supported Mr Bush to vote - an act which he believes brought the Republican victory in Florida, and therefore in the race as a whole.

Mr Siegel's latest intervention in 
the political process came in the form of an email sent to every 
Westgate employee on Monday afternoon, which was later leaked to Gawker.

He claimed that Mr Obama had 
initiated class warfare pitting the 'one per cent' against the rest, and
argued that in fact the interests of the wealthy were vital to the 
middle class too.

Mr 
Siegel continued: 'Sure, you may have heard about the big home that I'm 
building. I'm sure many people think that I live a privileged life. 
However, what you don't see or hear is the true story behind any success
that I have achieved.'

After an account of how he made his millions, he added: 'When you leave the office, you are done and you have a weekend all to yourself. I unfortunately do not have that freedom. I eat, live, and breathe this company every minute of the day, every day of the week. There is no rest. There is no weekend. There is no happy hour.'

He then launched into several paragraphs arguing that high business taxes were strangling the economy, and arguing that tax cuts for the rich helped stimulate the rest of the economy.

Mr Siegel concluded that if taxes are increased, 'you can find me in the Caribbean sitting on the beach, under a palm tree, retired, and with no employees to worry about.'

Many online commenters were initially sceptical about the authenticity of the letter, pointing out its similarities to an anonymous 2008 chain email expressing the same sentiments.

However, Mr Siegel told Gawker that he had indeed sent the message, saying that he 'used the letter that had circulated before as a guideline'.

He added: 'It gives [employees] something to think about when they go to the polls.'
