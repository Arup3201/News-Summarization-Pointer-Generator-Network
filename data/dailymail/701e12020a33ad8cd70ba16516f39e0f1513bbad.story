The eldest son of Paraguay’s president, Horacio Cartes, was arrested following a drunken attack outside the family’s luxury Miami apartment.

Police were called to the condo, in the St Regis Bal Harbour complex, in the early hours of Sunday morning.

Juan Pablo Cartes had thrown a party and was arrested for allegedly punching one of his guests, according to reports.

Cartes had got into an argument with the guest and ordered the complex’s security staff to remove him, according to The Miami Herald.

The guest was then allegedly punched in the eye by Cartes in the lobby of the building.

Cartes told The Miami Herald: ‘I wish to apologize for this bad moment, even though it wasn’t my fault. It’s one of my worst days. I’d rather not get into details.’

Officers arrested Cartes at 4.45am, after which he spent a short amount of time in jail before being released on bail.

The Paraguayan Government, according to the Herald, quoting news agency Ipparaguay, said: ‘The Cartes family deplores this incident and hopes it is quickly cleared, according to the laws of that country.’

Cartes is currently studying English at Miami Dade College.

His apartment is worth $2.8 million and is owned by Sarah Cartes, the sister of Paraguayan President Horacio Cartes, the Herald said.
