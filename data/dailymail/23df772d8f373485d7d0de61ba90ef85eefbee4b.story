An illegal immigrant proved a lasting
impression isn’t necessarily a good one when he went job hunting
naked and high.

Hispanic Jose Ayala arrived at a Del Paso Heights-area
welding shop on Saturday without a stitch of
clothing on his body and having taken methamphetamine.

‘I turn around and I’m like ‘whoa!’’  Owner Chris Johnson told CBS Local. ‘He said something
about he was looking for work, and he was good with his hands. I didn’t know
why a naked dude would be in my shop.’

Naked: Jose Ayala turned up to Chris Johnson's welding shop asking for a job completely naked.

Johnson escorted Ayala out of his Juliesse Avenue shop and told him to put
some clothes on before calling 911.

Two cops arrived and tried to arrest Ayala but he became aggressive and
started to fight them, pulling the female officer’s hair and kicking.

After a struggle they managed to get him to the ground, assisted
by three by-standers who bundled in to help.

Illegal: Ayala is an illegal immigrant and believed to be HIV positive.

‘There was like five people on him, still having a hard time
holding him down,’ Johnson said.

‘There was only so many parts you could grab.’

One multi-tasker pitched in with
one hand while clutching a burger in the other.

Fortunately for them police back-up arrived.

It took six
officers to tie Ayala up and bundle him into a patrol car, before whisking him
off to Sacramento County Jail.

Johnson captured the whole event on video and it has since gone viral on the internet. He said he has been unable to get any work done because of the number of calls he has had from TV channels wanting to know the story.

Fight: Two cops fought to restrain Ayala but he proved too strong for them.

Help: Bystanders pitched in as the cops wrestled with Ayala. He was kicking and pulling the female officer's hair.

Back-up: More officers arrived and it took six of them to tie Ayala up and bundle him into a patrol car.

Dectectives have advised anyone who came into contact with Ayala to be tested for HIV as he is apparently HIV positive.

They have also confirmed that he has been living in the United States illegally. He was refused bail and kept in prison on immigration hold.
