Kylie Bretag has been locked up in a detention centre in Mexico since October 20

An Australian woman who was on 'the trip of a lifetime' to celebrate her birthday and graduation, has been locked up in a Mexican detention centre.

Kylie Bretag has been kept in appalling conditions at the detention centre in Tenosique, a small Mexican town north of Guatemala, for the last six days and has no set date for her release.

The 30-year-old from Melbourne was arrested by Mexican officials while passing a checkpoint on a bus on October 20 after she was caught travelling in the country without a visa.

Natalie Wayt, Ms Bretag's close friend who was on her way to meet the recent graduate in Cancun before she was locked up, told Daily Mail Australia that Ms Bretag had crossed the border between San Diego and Mexico on foot in order to save money.

'Some travel websites says that if you want to save money go to San Diego and walk the border.

'It's actually very common, people from the US do it all the time. They just go down there and have lunch and then come back,' Ms Wayt said

Ms Wayt said her friend had crossed the border from San Diego to Mexico on foot after hearing that it was cheaper than flying online. She was then arrested while on a bus in Tenosique, north of Guatemala

'She even asked an official down there, because she had her passport in her hand, she asked him where she could get it stamped and he didn't say anything, just waved her on. There was a massive language barrier.

'She's committed a crime, but the punishment for it is deportation and she hasn't been deported yet. All she wants to do is go home.'

Until now, Ms Bretag had been keeping in contact with Ms Wayt and her family at home via a mobile phone. 

As of Sunday morning Australian time, the phone – her only way of contacting the outside world - was removed from her possession.

Ms Bretag was on 'the trip of a lifetime' to celebrate both her 30th birthday and graduation from her communications degree 

Ms Wayt said her friend had asked an official to stamp her passport when entering the country but, 'he didn't say anything, just waved her on'

'She told me: "I just want to go home, I'm living a nightmare",' Ms Wayt said.

Both her mother Colleen and Ms Wayt said staff at the detention centre continue to promise Ms Bretag that she will be deported and relocated on certain dates, and yet she continues to be held in Tenosique.

'We've been liaising with the Mexican consulate often, but they just say to us "she's going on such and such day" and that just hasn't happened. We're just waiting, waiting, waiting,' Colleen said.

The most recently set date for her departure is in two days' time but neither her family nor friends are convinced by the empty promises. 

There is no set date for her release of relocation as centre staff continue to make 'broken promises' 

Ms Bretag is being kept in a crowded cell with up to 20 other women, no clean water to bathe with and is sleeping on a thin mat on the floor

'There's no bus ticket, no plane ticket – that's just what the consultant has been told. I'd like to think that she will be leaving on Monday but I don't know what to believe any more,' Ms Wayt said.

In the meantime, Ms Bretag is being held in appalling conditions alongside more than 20 other women and dozens of children.

Sleeping on one of the numerous small mats that line the ground in a row on the floor, Ms Bretag told her friend that she is yet to bathe in the facility as she has no privacy and the shower 'is a box with a hole in it' with the water being supplied in buckets filled with recycled water from the sinks.

'But today was good,' Colleen said, 'because she managed to be let outside for 5 minutes'.

'We just all feel sick and really worried about not being able to communicate with her – but all we could say was 'we love you and stay calm'.

The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is believd to be providing consular assistance Ms Bretag, according to The Age. 

Ms Wayt has begun a media campaign in order to ensure and speed up her friend's release from detention
