David Moyes has revealed that he was offered the chance to return to the Premier League, but turned it down in favour of a chance to impress in La Liga.

Moyes was unveiled as the new manager of Real Sociedad in a press conference, and the former Everton and Manchester United man admitted he could still be in managing in England's top division.

‘To be completely fulfilled as a coach, you have to try different cultures. I’ve always wanted to work abroad,' said the 51-year-old Scot.

‘I never had any doubt (that I would get back into football). I had several offers to manage in the Premier League.

‘But this is the opportunity to manage in La Liga. I think it has overtaken the PL because of the quality of the teams, getting regularly into the latter stages of the Champions League.’

When pressed for comment on which Premier League teams had offered him a route back into management, Moyes refused to comment, stating, 'I would never do that. You know it's not my style.'

Moyes penned an 18-month contract with Sociedad, a far cry from the initial six-year deal he was given at Old Trafford. With reports he was offered four years in Spain, questions were raised as to why he opted for the shorter contract.

'I had the choice. The president gave me the opportunity. But I had a six year contract at United and I lasted nine months. So don’t get too caught up in the length of the contract. I don’t pay much attention to that.’

The Scotsman joins Real Sociedad with the club lagging in the lower echelons of La Liga, and Moyes explained the reasons for his decision to move to Spain.

'What convinced me to come was the president,' he explained. 'He was fantastically passionate about his club. He told me how special it was. His love for the club was what pulled me here.

‘But this is a big challenge. It’s an opportunity to show British managers can go and work abroad. Hopefully I’m the first of many.’

‘Me and the president have had some long conversations. But I had to be sure I was climbing to a club with ambition, because I want to win. We’ve only won two games this season but hopefully we can improve on that. 

'I see great morale among the players since I’ve been here and I think I have been lifted by the result they had last Sunday.’

Moyes is the fourth Brit to manage Real Sociedad, following on from Harry Lowe, John Toshack - who enjoyed three separate spells in charge between 1985 and 2002 - and latterly Chris Coleman.

Moyes enjoyed a very successful 11 years as the manager of Everton in the Premier League

His nine-month stint at Old Trafford was less successful though, and he was sacked in April 2014

It is Moyes' first foray into foreign management, and he cited La Liga's history of British managers as a contributing factor to his decision.

'Real (Sociedad) have had a great history of having British managers - John Toshack and Chris Coleman. And some of the greatest British managers have come and worked in La Liga - Bobby Robson and Terry Venables. 

'I’m not putting myself at their level but this is an opportunity to test myself against the best and hopefully I can do well here.’

And Moyes is far from in the dark when it comes to his new club. His knowledge, he insisted, goes right back to the early 1980s when he faced them wearing a Celtic shirt.

‘I knew a lot about Real Sociedad from a long time back. I came here in 82/83. I was with Celtic when we played Real Sociedad. I know all about the club, about the city. I also went to see La Real in Aberdeen when they qualified for the Europa League. I’m looking forward to getting stuck right into the job. I feel the job fits my character.’

Moyes' job now is to stamp his mark on Sociedad as he did with Everton. He was asked at the press conference whether he will be bringing in players from the Premier League.

'I will add staff in time. I can’t tell you how many people want to come and work here. I can't tell you how many players want to come and work here.’
