Love triangle: Katie Gilmore, pictured, has admitted she played her two lovers off against each other

The women at the centre of a love triangle with a Doctor Who actor today claimed he had ordered hitmen to murder his rival before he was killed.

Former prostitute Katie Gilmore, 27, was having a relationship with actor Gary Suller, 45, when he was allegedly murdered in his home in Pontnewydd, Cwmbran, south wales, by her lover Barry Bowyer.

Bowyer, 38, from Croesyceiliog, has admitted burglary and manslaughter but denies his murder.

Today Miss Gilmore, who admits playing both men off against each other, claimed it was Mr Suller who was so jealous he hired men to kill his love rival Bowyer.

She told Cardiff Crown Court: 'I blame myself for Gary’s death. I played them off against one another.

'He knew for a long time that I had been unfaithful to him. Gary was jealous and would do anything to stop me seeing Barry.

'I was told he was going to pay three men to murder Barry. Barry was in the bath when they kicked the flat door down and attacked him.

'He lost so much blood and should’ve died.'

Mr Suller, whose roles included small parts in Doctor Who and Casualty, met Ms Gilmore in a brothel in 2010.

Ms Gilmore said: 'He was infatuated with me and bombarded me with flowers, wrote lover letters and promised to look after me financially.'

The court heard family members hoped MS Gilmore, who took Valium at the age of seven, smoked cannabis at nine and began using heroin aged 11, would clean up after she started dating Mr Suller.

But Ms Gilmore claimed Mr Suller had 
encouraged her to take drugs and one occasion following her release from
prison had driven her to a dealer’s house.

She also claimed Mr Suller was a pimp,
saying a piece of paper that police found in his home with girls’ names
on it was a list of prostitutes he 'picked up' for jobs.

In love: Miss Gilmore said Barry Bowyer, who has admitted manslaughter, is the love of her life

The jury also heard details about how Ms Gilmore and Bowyer had met during a drug rehabilitation programme in September 2010.

She told the jury: 'He got me off heroin and prescription drugs. He’s the love of my life and will love him until the day I die.

'With Gary, my drug addiction escalated and increased. He had an unlimited supply of money.'

But the court was told how Bowyer's head 'became screwed up' after Ms Gilmore continued to flit between Bowyer and Mr Suller.

Four days before Mr Suller died, Bowyer wrote a letter to Ms Gilmore speaking about how he had felt manipulated.

He wrote: 'If you loved me you would 
have the decency to tell me the truth. I’m your bitch and I have got to 
take it or simply lose you.

'You know this very well and play it 
to your advantage. When I first met you... [I realised] you were a 
dangerous lady who would bring me life or death.'

The court heard Bowyer broke into Mr 
Suller's terraced home in Cwmbran, South Wales, and lay in wait before 
punching and kicking him to death in a 'savage and bloody' attack.

Divorced father-of-two Mr Suller, who 
appeared in Doctor Who, Casualty and other TV dramas often as a policeman or
prison officer, discovered he had landed a part in the TV series The 
Indian Doctor on the day of his murder.

Bowyer, of Cwmbran, denies murder claiming he killed Mr Suller in a 'momentarily lapse'. He admits manslaughter.

The trial continues.
