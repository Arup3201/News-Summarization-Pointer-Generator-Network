Leon Osman returns for his latest Footballers' Football Column, all about the World Cup. Osman was not selected by Roy Hodgson for a place in Brazil this summer but was involved in the England squad during the qualifying campaign. He runs the rule over England's first game of the campaign against Italy, the unfortunate nature of their defeat and how they can improve going forward.

Well, where do I start?

After all of the hype and excitement over the last few weeks, our opening game of the World Cup ended in defeat. However, losing to the 2006 World Champions was certainly no disgrace and I felt that there were plenty of positives to take from the performance.

I thought the selection was bold in the first place and that the lads gave a good account of themselves but football is a results business, especially in a World Cup competition when you only have three games to get it right, and we are now in a perilous position with only one game played.

Frustration: England were a bit unfortunate to lose to Italy, according to Leon Osman

That isn’t to say it’s not possible. The flair, speed and dynamism which we showed in Manaus was far more entertaining than any of the England games I have watched in our last few tournaments, and it leaves me very optimistic that we can get the necessary results against Uruguay and Costa Rica to make it to the knockout stage.

Despite the defeat against Italy I thoroughly enjoyed the game, and felt right up until the referee blew the final whistle that we were capable of getting an equalising goal, and that hasn’t always been the case in the past.

I expected Andrea Pirlo to be a class act and I wasn’t disappointed.

He pulled the strings for an Italian side that was terrific in possession. He is such an intelligent player he never seems to get caught in possession.

In fact, each of their midfield players looked comfortable when receiving the ball in tight spaces and that’s the mark of quality. Plenty of short passes and a very patient approach, which worked in really humid conditions.

Pass master: Andrea Pirlo recorded a pass completion rate of 93.2 per cent against England

Italy only pressed forward when they were ready so they were able to conserve energy and retain control of the ball.

It’s true that they didn’t hurt us too much when they did attack us but I thought they wore us down over the course of the 90 minutes.

England looked sharp and exciting and, as I stated, that’s really not the norm from us in these tournaments. Ironically, we posed more of an attacking threat than Italy but they always looked more in control.

When our attacks broke down we always seemed to be expending more energy trying to re-shape to cope with any counter moves. And let me tell you, it’s mentally harder to run about when you haven’t got the ball.

If I was disappointed in any aspect of the England display it was that we didn’t capitalise on our goal. We didn’t force ourselves on the Italians after drawing level. With the pace in our midfield and attack I would have liked us to have been a bit braver after Sturridge’s goal.

Celebration: England players celebrate after Daniel Sturridge nets the equaliser

We certainly have a goal threat in us and if we keep clean sheets against our next two opponents then I have no doubt that we can win the games.

The matches against Uruguay and Costa Rice will present different challenges to those we faced against Italy. I think both those teams will allow us to attack them more and try to frustrate us. It will be even more crucial not to concede the first goal.

As for my team-mates against Italy, I thought Phil Jagielka was outstanding. His goal-line clearance was typical of him. He read the situation early enough to get himself into a position to be able to head the ball away and save a certain goal.

It was a testing night for Leighton Baines defensively. I felt sorry for him. He was left 2 v 1 on numerous occasions, and at this level the top players will make you pay for that.

It also meant he couldn’t bomb forward like he does at Everton which is a big part of his game.

Clearance: Phil Jagielka heading the ball off the line following Mario Balotelli's shot on goal

When he does that for Everton he knows he’ll be well covered if the forward move breaks down. I’m not sure he has that confidence with England.

People have stated that he didn’t get enough help from Wayne Rooney and that could be right but then I don’t think wide left is Wayne’s best position.

Having trained and played with Wayne many times I believe he should be right behind the front one or two. It gives him more freedom and as a truly world class player he has the ability to unlock any defence that this World Cup can offer.

Bainesy and Wayne will make a big impact on the World Cup, of that I have no doubt.

Struggle: Wayne Rooney had a tricky night on the left for England on Saturday

And so can Ross Barkley. I was made up when he came on and I thought he gave a really mature display. His passing was accurate and that’s essential in the conditions and he gave Roy Hodgson something to think about.

I personally would start Ross against Uruguay. The kid looks so ready to take his opportunity and he looks like the World Cup stage is perfect for him.

Finally, our next game will bring together Jags and Luis Suarez.

There’s no doubt that Suarez is also a world class talent and he deservedly won our Footballer of the Year award but he’s not 100percent fit, that much seems clear. His country looked ordinary without him against Costa Rica and I am confident that Jags and Gary Cahill can look after him on Thursday.

It’s not a case of ‘stop Suarez and you stop Uruguay’ because they have other good players but he’s their king-pin. He’s the one they need firing on all cylinders and stopping him will be crucial for our World Cup dreams.

He will be desperate to put one over on England, you can be sure of that! Not as much as he seems to like putting one over Everton!

Waiting: Luis Suarez should be fit to face England after sitting out Uruguay's defeat to Costa Rica

But he’ll be keen to do well when he knows our whole country is watching him and willing him to fail on the night.

I’m really looking forward to watching our next game now. The exciting manner in which we played shows we can watch England and be very entertained at the same time. However, It’s win or bust against Uruguay for us now. We simply have to make sure that we get the three points.

If we win and Italy and Costa Rica draw it throws the group wide open. If we win and Italy win it puts them clear and us level with our final opponents but if we win and Costa Rica win then it means ...oh let’s just look after ourselves hey! Let’s leave the permutations and consequences until Friday morning.

I just hope you’re all enjoying it because I am.
