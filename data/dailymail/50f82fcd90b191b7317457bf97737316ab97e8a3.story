The family of a woman stabbed to death in a violent attack on her way to work said today she was a 'wonderful and caring' mother and wife who worked hard to reduce crime in her community.

Alison Morrison, 45, a member of the Harrow local safer neighbourhood board, suffered knife wounds all over her body as she was ambushed less than half a mile from her home.

Her neighbour, satellite TV engineer Trevor Gibbon, 48, was arrested by police, who found a large bloody kitchen knife nearby.

Killed: Alison Morrison, 45, lay fatally wounded in a pool of blood this morning as others rushed to her aid near her home in Harrow, north London. Her neighbour, satellite TV engineer Trevor Gibbon, 48, was arrested

Tragedy: The much-loved mother-of-one was stabbed in the street here in the way to work and witnesses said the attack lasted at least a minute

Other residents claimed that the pair had been locked in an increasingly bitter dispute over a shared driveway between their £410,000 end-of-terrace houses.

Mrs Morrison's sister, Julie Brathwaite, 51, rushed from her home in Waterlooville, Hampshire, to be with her brother-in-law and nephew last night. 

Her brother-in-law Lee Richards, said: 'We are just shocked and devastated.

'She was a wonderful, caring mother and top professional.

'She was a great mum and did good work for the community. She was just the best person and we are only just starting to come to terms with our loss. We cannot believe what has happened.' 

She lived with husband Cedric, 46, and their son, who is 16, and as well as her work for Which? magazine she was proud to be vice-chair of the Harrow Safer Neighbourhood Board, set up to lower crime and help victims of crime in their area. 

Scotland Yard paid tribute to her work with them in Harrow and said she 'truly cared' about her community. 

Her niece Bianca Brathwaite said: 'She was everything you could ask for In a woman, she was strong and always stood up for herself and her family and is loved dearly'.

One witness of the horrific attack, which took place during yesterday morning's rush hour, said: 'I was sitting in my room and heard some screaming I thought it was just people being silly. But on the third scream I ran outside and I saw [the attacker] on top of her.

'She was on the floor and a man was on top of her, attacking her.

'He had a big knife in his hands, I saw it flashing. It went on for about a minute at least. It's just so sad. It was awful.

'I think she was on her way to work.'

The row was apparently ignited when the local council repaved the street, but did not drop the kerb leading on to the driveway. This led the neighbours to argue about who could park where.

Letter: Mr Gibbon and his partner Maria Perrett had written to neighbours about a CCTV system

Row: Mrs Morrison is also said to have installed a bright security light which upset her neighbour, while Mr Gibbon had erected CCTV cameras on his home which caused animosity between the pair

As it spiralled out of control, the pair, who apparently used to be close, stopped talking to each other.

Other residents in the street in Harrow, north-west London, said matters got worse after Mrs Morrison's husband Cedric, 46, who underwent a kidney transplant several years ago, put up a bright security light.

A year ago Mr Gibbon's partner, 52-year-old school teacher Maria Perrett, gave neighbours a handwritten letter saying they had installed a CCTV camera.

Last night, one resident said: 'It has been going on for a couple of years. One had set up CCTV cameras and the other had a security light that seemed to be bothering them.

Touching: Mrs Morrison's sister today left a note and a bouquet of flowers at the scene where her sister died

Other floral tributes were also left at the spot where Mrs Morrison was fatally stabbed yesterday evening 

'The road got repaved and there was an argument about the shared driveway and who could park where.

'One of them would park their car in a way that agitated the other.

'I never saw them rowing in the street but everyone was aware of it because they used to speak to each other but now they don't. Things seemed to have eased and I thought it was resolved.'

Another neighbour said: 'It was all to do with the shared drive.

'The road and pavement were replaced and the kerb wasn't dropped – I think it was something to do with access.

'Last year or the early part of this year I saw them outside talking about it but they weren't shouting and arguing, just talking.'

Mrs Morrison's family were too upset to speak last night as police stood outside their home.

Just yards away, forensic experts were searching through bins in the shared driveway between their homes, which was cordoned off with police tape.

Death: The woman was stabbed in Alexandra Avenue, a main thoroughfare through Harrow, north London

Mrs Morrison, who had a 16-year-old son, Kori, was a senior manager at consumer organisation Which? as well as a dedicated volunteer and adviser to charities. Earlier this year, she joined her local safer neighbourhood board, which aims to cut crime and tackle antisocial behaviour.

Chief Superintendent Simon Ovens, Borough Commander for Harrow, said: 'I had the pleasure of knowing and working with Alison in her role as the Vice-Chair of our borough's Safer Neighbourhood Board. She was held in high regard locally, and truly cared about the borough. Her friends within the local community will be devastated by her loss.

'Her input to policing as a 'critical friend' has been invaluable, someone who always provided honest feedback.

'The Homicide and Major Crime Command quickly arrested a man on suspicion of Alison's murder, and their work is ongoing to establish the motive behind this crime'. 

Cllr David Perry, Leader of Harrow Council, said: 'Alison Morrison was passionately committed to creating a safer Harrow through her work with the Harrow Safer Neighbourhood Board and as a Community Champion, and it is terrible news that she has lost her life in this violent way in a borough she cared so much about.

'Alison’s colleagues on the Safer Neighbourhood Board are absolutely shattered by this news as are the staff of Harrow Council. Alison was a key member of the Board and a tireless advocate of its work.'

Neighbours said they were 'devastated' at her death.

Describing her as a 'nice girl', one added: 'This is such a shock to me.

'Especially in the run-up to Christmas. We only received a Christmas card from her yesterday.' 

One family friend said: 'Everyone is in bits. We cannot believe what has happened'. 

Which? group chief executive Peter Vicary-Smith joined the tributes to Mrs Morrison.

He said: 'Alison was a hugely popular member of staff and her sudden death has come as a great shock to us all'.
