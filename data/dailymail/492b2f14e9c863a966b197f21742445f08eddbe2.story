A beauty queen born with half an arm is hoping to inspire girls just like her to overcome their disabilities.

Katie Cooper, from Worcester, entered a beauty pageant to prove to her daughter, Eden, who has Cerebal Palsy, that disabilities shouldn’t hold people back.

And she has now been crowned Miss Dream Street Worcestershire - and is in the running to take the national crown.

Inspired: Katie Cooper, 20, pictured with her daughter Eden, 16 months, is using her title as a beauty queen to raise awareness of disability and encourage youngsters to pursue their dreams

Katie, 20, had always been embarrassed of the stump on her left arm and used to hide it under a jacket to stop people staring.

Despite these fears, her twin sister enrolled her into the beauty pageant and the avid dancer came out on top.

Katie is hoping her endeavors will inspire her 17-month-old daughter, Eden, who was born with cerebral palsy, to follow her dreams no matter what.

Confident: After winning the regional competition, and another branch of the contest - Miss Inspirational - she says there's no looking back

Katie said: 'Ahead of the pageant I wasn’t very confident of winning. My sister Claire entered me and I really wasn’t sure about putting myself out there - but I wanted to set my daughter a good example.

'I used to get bullied because of my stump when I was a teenager, so badly that I had to move schools.

'I had never seen myself as having a disability but I used to get very embarrassed of my arm.

'People would stop and stare, so I used to hide it under a jacket. But now I know I’ve got nothing to be embarrassed about.'

Big plans: Whether she wins the pageant or not, she is hoping to use these new lessons to achieve her dream of becoming a professional dancer

Competition: Katie is looking to beat 70 other women when she competes in the Miss Dream UK Finals in Birmingham on August 9

Katie’s confidence was so low she only decided to take part in the pageant three days before.

After winning the regional competition, and another branch of the contest - Miss Inspirational - she says there’s no looking back.

Katie said: 'Winning the competition really boosted my confidence. I want to pass the experiences I’ve had on to Eden so she knows she can do whatever she wants in life.'

Whether she wins or not, she is hoping to use these new lessons to achieve her dream of becoming a professional dancer.

She added: 'My arm has never stopped me from dancing, which I started doing when I was 11.

'I really want to dance professionally or become a showgirl. Doing this pageant has shown me I don’t need to fear doing either of those things.'

Sharing her experiences: Katie said: 'Winning the competition really boosted my confidence. I want to pass the experiences I've had on to Eden so she knows she can do whatever she wants in life'
