A high school in Massachusetts is planning to tackle underage binge drinking at dances by breathalyzing students at the door.

Belmont High School will test pupils for alcohol consumption before every school dance, perhaps as soon as the next event on February 9.

The school has experienced problems with drinking before, such as an event in 2005 where 12 students were suspended, but it is now taking a direct approach. 

Testing times: Belmont High is planning to breathalyze students at the door to school dances

Dr. Thomas Kingston, the school's interim superintendent, told Boston.com, that: 'There have been problems in the past, as in most suburbs – students who binge in the parking lot and come in looking perfectly normal, but half an hour later, blotto.'

'We even had one incident where a student threw up on the shoes of the principal’s wife,' Kingston added.

The superintendent told Myfoxboston.com that Belmont police officers will meet students at the entrance to the prom with breathalysers. 

But Kingston also says that the planning for the new regime is still at an early stage and it is not yet decided if the school will test every student, or just the ones that seem intoxicated.

Secret binge drinking is problem at many high schools

The school is currently working with police and the local attorney's office to plan the new measures, while the school committee will have the final say.

'I’m not holding to a particular schedule,' Kingston told Boston.com. 'It depends on how confident we are that it is appropriate, and whether civil liberties are protected, and we’ve exercised due diligence.'

During a Hawaiian-themed 'Luau' dance
in 2005, a number of severely intoxicated students were taken to local 
hospitals due to alcohol poisoning.

The event was cancelled and 12 students were suspended. Since 
then Belmont High has tried a number of measures to crack down on 
drunkenness at school functions.

The school has vastly reduced the 
number and the length of official dances. And in 2008 Belmont introduced
a 'promenade' event before attendees went to the prom.

During the promenade, students are 
made to walk down the aisle of the auditorium with their dates in front 
of the whole school community, as well as family and friends.

But it seems that students are still turning up drunk at dances and the school has now called in breathalyzers and the police for assistance.

According to Fox Boston, this practice already takes place at schools in other Massachusetts cities and towns.
