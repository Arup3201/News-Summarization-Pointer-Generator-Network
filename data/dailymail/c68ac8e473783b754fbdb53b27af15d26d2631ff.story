A Venezuelan man who lost his arm in a motorcycle accident has built his own prosthesis after finding out he was to become a father.

Angel Sanguino, from Caracas, built an ingenious robotic arm that allows him to perform a series of useful tasks and resume his career as an electronics technician to provide for his family.

A doctor had advised Mr Sanguino to accept his disability, but he instead built his own prosthesis to carry on with this old life and win a prize for science, technology and innovation.

A Venezuelan electrician who lost his arm in a motorcycle accident, has built his own prosthesis using domestic materials after finding out he was to become a father

The 33-year-old was riding his motorbike last year when he was hit by a speeding car competing in an illegal street race, Oddity Central reported.

Mr Sanguino was rushed to the emergency room, but doctors had to amputate his left arm from the shoulder.

He also suffered severe internal organ damage and fractured legs.

The amputation operation was 
particularly traumatic as it was clear that the electronics technician, 
who worked for a computer part manufacturer, would not be able to 
continue doing his job with one arm.

Angel Sanguino's arm has a clamp for holding objects so that he can grip electronic items in need of repair, as well as a magnifying glass and lighting so he can repair fiddly components more easily and earn a living

While an orthopedist told Mr Sanguino that he should come to terms with his disability and move on with life in a new way, he had other ideas.

When lying in intensive care recovering from his injuries, Mr Sanguino learned he would soon become a father, which made him determined to provide for his new family.

Just three months after his accident, Mr Sanguino designed a prosthetic arm that would allow him to repair electrical components and earn a living as he did before.

He created his robotic arm with the help of his orthopedist uncle, Brunel Rodriguez, who provided the essential parts to build the prosthesis.

Mr Sanguino
used his electronics expertise to ensure the arm performed the 
functions he needed to allow him to resume his job without anyone else's
help.

Although the arm looks rather basic, it has a number of switches and sensors that allow  Mr Sanguino to control it with the movement around his collarbone.

It
also has a clamp for holding objects so that he can grip electronic 
items in need of repair, as well as a magnifying glass and lighting so 
he can fix fiddly components more easily.

Before his accident,   Mr Sanguino used to mend six mobile phones every day.

With the help of his new prostheses, he can fix four, but plans on upgrading his arm to help boost his productivity.

Mr Sanguino's
home made robotic arm cost between 2,000 and 5,000 bolivars - between 
£200 and £500 because it was largely built from domestic materials.

He said: 'I’m doing this kind of prosthesis for 
me, but if one day someone wants me to make one for them, I can do it 
with my eyes closed and adapt it to the way they live and work.'

The robotic arm is powered by a small motor connected to a battery and has sensors connected to Mr Sanguino's collarbone to detect movements

Mr Sanguino also intends to build a more efficient wheelchair to donate to a child who needs it.

The duo's focus was on functionality, not aesthetics, but  Mr Sanguino already has plans to develop a new prosthesis that looks more like a natural arm.

He also intends to replace the 
small motor with a servomotor that will allow him to control his arm 
faster and with more precision.

A prosthesis costs 90,000 bolivars in Venuzuela, which is equivalent to approximately £9,500 - an amount that is too much for many people to afford.
