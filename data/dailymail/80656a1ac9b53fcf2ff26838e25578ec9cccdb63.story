One of Detroit’s most famous fictional sons is set to be honoured in bronze, as the city unveils a statue of the 80s crime-fighting cyborg RoboCop.

The statue of Motor City’s protector will be erected next year after more than $67,000 was raised in under a week to fund the project.

The foam model of RoboCop has finally made its way to Detroit, and is being prepared for the bronze castings, over 25 years after cult film was released in 1987.

The road to RoboCop began in February 
2011, when Detroit’s Mayor Dave Bing asked his Twitter followers what 
Detroit needed in the future.

As
a response, one Massachusetts resident tweeted: 'Philadelphia has a 
statue of Rocky & Robocop would kick Rocky's butt. He's a GREAT 
ambassador for Detroit.’

Not
knowing what he was about to start, Mayor Bing replied: ‘There are not 
any plans to erect a statue to Robocop. Thank you for the suggestion.'

RoboCop fans, not missing a beat, launched a Facebook campaign for the statue requesting donations from around the world.

The Kickstarter campaign lasted just six days, during which 2,718 people donated $67,436 to ensure that a giant Robocop would be watching over Detroit.

A
majority of the funds, $25,000, came from graphic designer Pete 
Hottelet of Omni Consumer Products, a San Francisco company named after 
the fictional corporation which builds RoboCop in the film.

Venus
Bronze Works in Detroit is getting ready to cast pieces of the model, 
and RoboCop campaigners hope the statue will stand in a prominent place 
downtown.

Brandon Walley, 
director of development for the nonprofit the Imagination Station, says 
the statue "will add nicely to Detroit and the rejuvenation that's 
happening here."

The 1987 
science fiction movie was set in a futuristic and crime-ridden Detroit, 
and spun off into two sequels and a television series.

A remake starring Joel Kinnaman as RoboCop with Gary Oldman and Samuel L Jackson in supporting roles is set to premiere in 
February 2014.

No location 
in the city has been announced yet for its placement as the group, 
working behind the website DetroitNeedsRoboCop.com, continues to take 
suggestions and weigh their options.

But according to Mr Walley, no matter where that is, one thing's for sure, it 'will withstand the end of time.
