The Manchester City players arrived in a sombre mood as they reported for training on Monday after throwing away two a two goal lead against relegation battlers Burnley.

Manuel Pellegrini returned to the drawing board, contemplating on allowing the gap between his side and league leaders Chelsea slip from one point to four.

‘Maybe at 2-0, we thought the game was over,’ the City boss said after the game, ‘Until the final whistle, the game is never finished.’

Pellegrini's men lead the Clarets going into half time, and looked to be heading for their tenth straight victory following goals from the in-form David Silva and Brazilian Fernandinho.

Two goals to the good, City found their lead halved just after the interval as George Boyd netted two minutes after the restart. 

Quite what Burnley manager Sean Dyche had said to his players at half time is unclear but it must have been inspirational. 

The Blues then completely switched off and with ten minutes to go Ashley Barnes thundered in the equaliser in front of the stunned onlookers at the Etihad.

Pellegrini may be considering turning his focus to team fitness after commenting on City's lack of urgency in the second half.

'We changed our pace or we couldn’t continue at the same pace,’ he said.
