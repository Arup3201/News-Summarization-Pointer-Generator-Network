Lazarus - also known as Larry - was born at Bedfordshire’s Whipsnade Zoo and workers were forced to take him home with them for round-the-clock care.

The Thomson's gazelle was born as part of an exciting breeding programme run by the Zoological Society of London, but was rejected by his mother not long after the birth. 

Despite initially looking as if she was properly caring for her firstborn fawn, it was soon clear that the newborn gazelle's mother was unable to produce any milk for her young.

Zookeepers were forced to step in and provide around the clock feeding for the fawn.

‘Initially, he needed quite a lot of attention and feeding around the clock, so it was more practical just to take him home for the first few days,’ senior keeper Mark Holden said.

Once he was feeding and taking his milk well, the decision was made to return young Larry to the zoo.

Zookeepers were quick to re-integrate him with his fellow Thomson's gazelles - especially considering he is only one of four Thomson's gazelles currently in the United Kingdom.

‘He’s a bit more of a handful now, which is good - because that’s what we want to see. It’s a good indication that he’s feeding well and obviously he’s becoming stronger,’ Mr Holden said.

Despite being touch-and-go for a while, Larry pulled through and is now doing well.
