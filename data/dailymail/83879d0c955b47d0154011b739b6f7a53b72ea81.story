Former Arsenal star Cesc Fabregas caught up with Gunners legend Bob Wilson on Wednesday as the duo took part in 'Stars On Canvas' for UK charity Willow.

Having previously spent eight years in north London, the Spanish midfielder controversially joined rivals Chelsea from Barcelona in the summer.

However, having changed his allegiance from the red of Arsenal to the blue of Chelsea, Fabregas was all smiles with his old pal Wilson from his time at Highbury and the Emirates.

Fabregas posted a picture of the pair - stood in front of a variety of canvases created by well-known names - to his Instagram account and said: 'Took part in #StarsOnCanvas for @willow_fdn + @bobwilsonbwsc. Auction to 23 Nov @ starsoncanvas.org.uk & at eddonStreet@RegentStreetW1' before ending the message 'Great to see you again Bob.' 

Each canvas will be auctioned for the  Willow Foundation - set up by Wilson and his wife Megs in memory of their daughter Anna who passed away in 1998 - which helps seriously ill young adults between the ages of 16 and 40.

Former goalkeeper Wilson, who made 234 league appearances between the sticks for the Gunners between 1963 and 1974, is part of the furniture at Arsenal having coached at the club until 2003 - the year Fabregas signed for Arsene Wenger's side.
