Veteran broadcaster Stuart Hall says Jeremy Clarkson is 'deluded' for claiming he would rather quit Top Gear than move north with the BBC.

Clarkson, 51, described Salford as 'a small suburb with little to offer beyond a Starbucks and a canal with ducks'.

He added: 'Every year we’d end up making a Christmas special from the Dog and Duck or the nearest Arndale Centre.'

The BBC is moving five departments to Salford Quays from London, but has no plans to relocate the Top Gear team.

Former It’s A Knockout presenter Hall, 81, wrote in the Radio Times: ‘Clarkson is deluded. Does he imagine that at the advance of effete southerners, we retreat to our outside lavatories with ripped-up copies of the News of the Screws?

‘That in our back-to-back terraces we ply Uncle Fred with chitterlings, chunks, bangers and chips, sit him in a commode, chamberpot handy, an ashtray full of dog ends, a basketful of empty tinnies and pretend he’s dying through lack of care?’

BBC sports commentator Hall, born in Ashton-under-Lyne, Lancashire, added: ‘Manchester is booming, the financial sector deals with the world.

'Our scientists lead. Manchester is a seat of knowledge, a breeding ground for brains.’

He added that Salford's Media City will be a 'haven for the creative mind, far from London's overcrowded, cosmopolitan fever heat and crush.'

Clarkson has claimed that the BBC's move to Salford is a 'box-ticking exercise', writing in a newspaper column earlier this year: 'A lof of the arguments against the BBC's move have been centred on expense, but I believe there's a more important problem than money.

'In short, Salford is up north.'

Several high-profile BBC presenters have so far refused to make the move to Manchester, including BBC Breakfast co-host Sian Williams and Chris Hollins, the sports presenter.
