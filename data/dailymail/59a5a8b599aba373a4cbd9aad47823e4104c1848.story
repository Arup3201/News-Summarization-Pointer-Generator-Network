Left dangling in mid-air: The Mayor's 2012 Olympic gaffe

Few people seem to be in much of a rush during the rush hour here. There is certainly nothing that could be described as a queue at this station. At times, there is no one at all.

According to the Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, the £60 million trans-Thames shuttle — Britain’s first urban cable car, no less — is a ‘much-needed new river crossing in the east of our great city’. He has even incorporated it into the hallowed London Tube map.

However, according to figures just revealed (but only after a Freedom of Information request), this is arguably the most pointless piece of public transport in the country.

For since its grand opening two years ago, the total number of commuters using the panoramic Emirates Air Line to travel to work appears to have fallen to an all-time low — of none at all.

This astonishing statistic is based on the number of Oyster cards (London travel passes) used on the cable car during a given week this autumn. 

Regular users are deemed to be those who take the £3.30 service in either direction five times or more in a week and they qualify for a half-price discount. So how many regular users does the thing have? Precisely none.

Extraordinary. Or to put it in Johnsonian terms: Cripes!

So much for Mr Mayor’s boast that his ten-seater fibreglass bubbles over the Thames have been ‘a howling success’, bringing ‘new jobs, homes and enterprise’ to ‘a vibrant new metropolitan quarter’.

This scheme is more like his other attempt at suspended travel when he set off down that Olympic zip wire in 2012 — and famously got stuck.

View of the O2: To be fair, the cable car has had precious little commuter traffic ever since it opened in 2012

Across the water: Spanning the Thames between the O2 Arena on the southern bank and the Royal Docks with its ExCel exhibition centre to the north, the idea was to carry up to 2,500 people an hour

A Transport for London (TfL) spokesman insists commuters really do exist. It is just that they do not travel in ‘conventional’ ways.

I might be more inclined to swallow this PR spiel if I wasn’t immediately ordered off the premises and told I need a special permit to talk to the public.

So I stand at the station perimeter and talk to people there. And they all still seem to be tourists.

To be fair, the cable car has had precious little commuter traffic ever since it opened in 2012. During its first year, the number of regular users was found to be 16. Last year, that had fallen to four. Now, they would appear to be extinct.

TfL’s head of the Air Line, Danny Price, tells me the figures are misleading because regular users tend to buy a book of discounted tickets, which they can use any time, rather than pay with their Oyster cards.

But even he says that regulars comprise just 3 per cent of his customers. Darryl Chamberlain, the local blogger who submitted the Freedom of Information request, says the number is a single round figure: nought.

Whether the true answer is ‘a handful’ or zero, the question remains the same: why on earth was this white elephant — connecting two not very interesting places — built in the first place?

Spanning the Thames between the O2 Arena — the old Millennium Dome — on the southern bank and the Royal Docks with its ExCel exhibition centre to the north, the idea was to carry up to 2,500 people an hour.

Questions: Why on earth was this white elephant - connecting two not very interesting places - built in the first place?

A third were expected to be regular commuters, a third were expected to be visitors travelling between events on either side of the river and the remaining third would simply be enjoying the ride.

It would play a modest role during the 2012 Games since it connected two Olympic sites (but this was useful only if you happened to have tickets for both).

As it turns out, the vast majority of passengers (70 per cent, according to TfL’s surveys; 95 per cent, according to mine) are simply here for fun.

In other words, it’s a theme park ride. But it is hardly the role of our transport authorities to build funfair attractions.

The £60 million construction cost was met by £36 million in sponsorship from Emirates, £8 million from an EU regional slush fund and £16 million from the taxpayer.

While the former Mayor, Ken Livingstone, predicted that the project would be a ‘disaster’, Johnson was delighted to have another eye-catching wheeze to go with his ‘Boris’ rent-a-bikes and his hop on/hop off buses. ‘Get on this immediately!’ he proclaimed at the end of his inaugural flight.

It would be wrong to say that this spectacular ride, dangling nearly 300 ft over the Thames for the best part of ten minutes, is unpopular.

Each week, thousands of tourists make the round trip, so much so that TfL insist the cable car is paying its way and enjoys exemplary ‘customer satisfaction’ scores.

Sitting up here, even on a grey and windy afternoon, I can see why.

As a visitor attraction, it is not unlike the London Eye, the capital’s big wheel near Waterloo station.

This cable car might not overlook Big Ben and Buckingham Palace, but it commands an impressive view of the gritty end of London, it’s only a fraction of the price of the £29.50-a-time wheel and you certainly don’t need to book in advance.

Taking off from the south side, I get a cracking view of the former Dome, liberated from state control and reborn as a concert venue.

To the east, the mighty vaulted sluices of the Thames Barrier are faintly reminiscent of the Sydney Opera House. The skyscrapers of Canary Wharf blot out much of the broader London landscape but I can see Royal Greenwich in one direction and the Olympic Park in the other.

What is striking is how much old-fashioned industry is still here in the East End, much of it unchanged since World War II. It dawns on me that the last time people routinely flew this low over places such as Silvertown and Trinity Buoy Wharf, they were in Luftwaffe uniform.

We come in to land at Royal Docks and it’s not terribly inviting. There are a few lifeless apartment blocks, a couple of coffee shops, a halal burger van and a Tesco Metro. The ExCel exhibition centre is a five-minute walk away, but there’s nothing on there today. Most cable car passengers stay on board and go straight back to North Greenwich.

Among those I do find wandering around are the Fairweather family from Greenwich. Despite living nearby, they had never used the cable car until today.

‘It’s been on our to do list for a long time and now we’ve done it,’ says Dad. All like the views.

But they cannot see the point of an aerial link between two places already connected by the Tube (and it’s only a couple of stops).

TfL insists the cable car carries 1.5 million paying customers each year and this figure will increase as the area is developed.

‘It’s great to have something that gives the area an identity,’ says Danny Price, adding that it is the first project in London transport history to attract complaints for being too quick.

‘When we started, it took five minutes to get across and people complained it wasn’t long enough.’ Now, it’s a five-minute ride before 9am and ten minutes thereafter.

But even if it does manage to repay the £16 million spent by the taxpayer, should the state be wasting time on this sort of vanity project?

And does it really deserve to be on the world-famous London Tube map with its very own livery?

I suppose it makes a good pub quiz question: Which London Tube line is marked in red and white? Answer: The Emirates Air Line.

As dusk falls, I search for a phantom commuter in the evening rush hour. Finally, a lone figure alights purposefully with a walking stick at North Greenwich. Could it be . . . ?

‘Yup. I’m your man,’ laughs Peter Vickers, 60. ‘I’ve been using this every day since it opened to get to work and I think it’s fantastic.’

The disabled father of three gets a mini-cab from his home in Charlton, South London, to the cable car, uses a discounted book of tickets rather than an Oyster card to fly over the Thames and then picks up a minicab on the other side to his office in Ilford, East London.

‘It’s hard to get a seat on the Tube and the cable car has step-free access. My brother calls it the best-kept secret in London.’

Perhaps its day will come. Perhaps, like its neighbour, the old Dome, the Air Line will evolve from a national joke into a national treasure.

Perhaps TfL will eventually uproot it and put it somewhere genuinely useful.

In the meantime, just sit back and enjoy the peace, the view and the emptiness on Boris’s East End ghost train.
