Snipers on board military helicopters will patrol the skies over  London during next summer’s Olympic Games.

Sources say the military crackshots – dubbed ‘heli-snipers’ by defence chiefs – will fly above the capital  in case terrorists attempt an atrocity at the prestigious event.

The RAF snipers are understood to have been training recently at the restricted Lydd military live-firing range near the Kent coast to sharpen their skills.

Taking aim: RAF snipers will be deployed in London to target potential threats to the 2012 Olympic Games

Death from above: The snipers will hover above Olympic sites in Lynx MK7 helicopters, like this one, which have been used in Iraq and Afghanistan

One source told The Mail on Sunday 
that the training had been designed specifically to prepare for an 
Olympic Games deployment to protect stadium sites in East London and 
elsewhere.

Flying in Merlin
or Lynx helicopters, the snipers are capable of killing an attacker at a
range of more than a mile using a Barrett ‘Light Fifty’ rifle, which 
fires a powerful .50-calibre half-inch bullet at 2,799 feet per second.

Even
at night, the flying snipers can kill an enemy 1,000 yards away using 
night sights and infra-red lasers for target-marking as they keep in 
touch with commanders on the ground using encrypted military radio 
frequencies.

Their
rifles have the power to destroy engine blocks and fire through 
concrete from long range, making it difficult for a terrorist to take 
cover.

Bird's eye view: The snipers will be able to kill suspected terrorists from up to a mile away - even at night

The airborne sharpshooters were deployed in Iraq, where they were
described by the Ministry of Defence as a ‘special weapon’ against the 
insurgent threat.

In Iraq, 
the snipers were on standby around the clock to provide protection from 
the air and carried out sniping and surveillance duties on the ground.

Now,
they could find themselves on operational duty in the UK for the first 
time, helping to protect prime venues such as the 80,000-seat Olympic 
Stadium and the Aquatic Centre.

Airborne threats: Surface-to-air missiles may also be part of the armoury available to Olympics security forces

Last week, Defence Secretary Philip Hammond revealed in the Commons after a question from his predecessor, Dr Liam Fox, that ground-to-air missiles were part of the armoury that may be used during the Olympics if required. 

Mr Hammond’s statement was interpreted as an attempt to show how seriously the UK is taking the terror threat after it was revealed that the US is preparing to send 1,000 armed agents, including 500 from the FBI, to protect its competitors.

A Ministry of Defence spokesman said last night: ‘The MoD has been fully involved in Olympic security planning work and it is anticipated that the Armed Forces, at the request of the civilian authorities, will provide some specialist support including the use of assets where appropriate. However, this will be a police-led operation and any military involvement will be in a supporting role.

‘It is too early to talk about the numbers of personnel who may be involved or further details around precisely what support the MoD might provide – but ongoing  planning to meet a range of contingencies is sensible.’

The spokesman added: ‘This work is not in response to any specific threat but, as the Defence Secretary said in Parliament, all necessary measures to ensure the security and safety of the London Olympic Games will be taken.’
