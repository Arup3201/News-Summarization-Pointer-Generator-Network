Scientists in Canada are looking for a meteorite that may have struck in the southwestern part of Ontario after a huge fireball was seen streaking across the sky on Tuesday night.

Seven video cameras run by the University of Western Ontario captured the amazing sight at 10:24p local time. One of the cameras located in Aylmer, Ontario, not far from Lake Erie, shows the giant fireball, at times getting bigger and brighter as it moved across the sky.

The fireball was also caught on two cameras in Ohio and Pennsylvania.

Researchers at the university say the meteorite was about the size of a basketball. It was traveling 75 kilometers (46 miles) above the earth's surface at a speed of 14 kilometer per second (slightly under 9 miles).

Although the meteorite has yet to be found, scientists believe fragments may have landed just north of St. Thomas, Ontario.

Meteorities have a dark, scalloped exterior, but are denser than normal rocks. Also, they can attract magnets due to their metal content.

More information on the meterorite may come today as two university researchers along with the head of NASA's Meteroid Environment office provide an update to the media.
