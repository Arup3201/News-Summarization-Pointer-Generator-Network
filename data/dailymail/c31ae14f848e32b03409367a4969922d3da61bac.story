Barcelona vs Paris Saint-Germain (Nou Camp)

Team news

Barca will be without suspended Brazil right back Dani Alves but Luis Enrique refused to be drawn on who might replace him in the starting lineup.

Adriano is the obvious choice, or Martin Montoya, although the latter has barely featured this term.

Barca have not failed to win their Champions League group since 2006-07 and have won 22 of their last home games in Europe's elite club competition, losing just once.

Paris Saint-Germain

Team news 

After Chelsea lost last weekend in England, PSG is the only unbeaten side in Europe's biggest leagues.

PSG hasn't played sparkling football, but the individual qualities of its creative players have made up for its collective inadequacies so far.

Zlatan Ibrahimovic scored twice in a 2-1 comeback over Nantes on Saturday, and Edinson Cavani has netted eight goals in his last 10 matches.

'PSG is the last unbeaten team and it's a pleasure,' PSG coach Laurent Blanc said. 'You need to wait until the end to assess a season, but I'm sure there will be better days. I'm optimistic we will continue to take points, but with style.'

Key match stats (supplied by Opta)

Barcelona will win their eighth Champions League group in a row if they defeat PSG at the Camp Nou.

PSG finished first in their Champions League group in each of the last two seasons – their best run in the competition. They would improve their run this season with a draw.

Barcelona vs PSG and Porto vs Shakhtar are the only two games this Matchday between two sides already qualified for the round of last 16.

Barcelona (90.1 per cent) and Paris Saint Germain (89.06 per cent) are the two teams with the highest passing accuracy in the Champions League this season.

Lionel Messi is the top scorer in Champions League history with 74 goals.

Zlatan Ibrahimovic has not scored against his former club Barcelona at the Camp Nou in his two CL games there since leaving, but he has netted two goals in three home appearances against them.

Barcelona have lost just one of their last 10 European games against French opposition (W5 D4), but that defeat came in their last meeting against PSG earlier this season (2-3).

However, the Catalan side have never defeated PSG in the Champions League/European Cup (D3 L2). They did them in the 1997 Cup Winners’ Cup Final (1-0) though.

In 156 European games between Spanish and French sides, the Spaniards have won 70 and have kept 53 clean sheets (D41 L45).

None of the last 11 goals scored in CL games between Barcelona and PSG have come from outside the box.
