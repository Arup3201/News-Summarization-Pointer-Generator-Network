Boris Johnson has blocked Christian campaigners from using advertisements on London buses to promote their message on homosexuality.

The London mayor personally vetoed the campaign, which was due to start next week, because he said it suggested gay people can be cured.

The Christian adverts, which mimic an initiative by pro-gay group Stonewall, were intended to advertise 'gay conversion' through therapy.

Is Boris right to ban posters suggesting gays have an illness?

But after being alerted to the plans, 
the Tory mayor took immediate steps to halt the 'offensive' campaign, 
which he said had no place in a tolerant city.

Transport for London subcontracts 
advertising for the city's buses to agency CBSO, which ran the campaign 
past the Advertising Standards Authority. The ASA said it 'does not 
infringe any advertising rules in the UK'.

The posters are backed by two Christian groups, the Core Issues Trust and Anglican Mainstream.

They were due to say: 'Not gay! 
Ex-gay, post-gay and proud. Get over it!' Post-gay and ex-gay are terms 
used to refer to homosexuals who have undergone spiritual or pastoral 
therapy and, according to Anglican Mainstream, have 'now left a 
homosexual lifestyle'.

The adverts were expected to appear 
for two weeks on five routes covering top tourist destinations including
St Paul's Cathedral and Oxford Street.

They were a direct response to Stonewall's most recent campaign, which suggested being gay is innate and unchangeable.

Message: Stonewall's ad seen on a bus driving past Oxford Circus in central London

It ran adverts on London buses saying: 'Some people are gay. Get over it.'

Mr Johnson used his powers as chairman of Transport for London to instruct the body to ditch the campaign.

He said yesterday: 'London is one of the most tolerant cities in the world and intolerant of intolerance.

'It is clearly offensive to suggest 
that being gay is an illness that someone recovers from and I am not 
prepared to have that suggestion driven around London on our buses.'

Mike Davidson, leader of the Core 
Issues Trust, said: 'I didn't realise censorship was in place. We went 
through the correct channels.'
