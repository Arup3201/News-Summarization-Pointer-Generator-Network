Over a thousand mourners turned out to give a heroine's send off to a teenage hit-and-run victim who died after pushing her friend out of the path of an oncoming car.

Friends and family paying tribute to Jasmyn Chan at her funeral at City Road Crematorium in Sheffield were told her selfless act was not something learned in a few seconds but rather 'a way of life'.

The 14-year-old died last month when she was hit by a car just yards from her home in Sheffield, as she tried to push her friend Tia Tucker, 12, from danger.

A 32-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving and is on bail.

Family, friends and well-wishers stood in complete silence as Jasmyn's white coffin arrived in a horse-drawn hearse.

The hearse was followed by family and friends being driven in two limousines and a vintage motorised hearse carrying floral tributes.

The coffin was carried into the crematorium to the Enrique Iglesias song 'Hero', followed by her family - each carrying a white rose - and Tia, who had a pink cast on her leg.

Mourners who had been patiently waiting outside began to file in, but the huge crowd meant many stood in the sun and listened to the short service on loudspeakers.

It is thought that more than 1,000 mourners came to the crematorium to pay their last respects to the schoolgirl

At several points during the 25-minute service, the Reverend Mike Reeder made reference to the John Legend song 'All Of Me', relating it to the final moment before she died.

He told the congregation: 'The split seconds that were left to Jas, she thought of someone else and pushed Tia out of the way of the oncoming car.

'This action is not something that is learnt in the split seconds before a decision has to be taken, it is a way of life and is as normal as breathing to those who have such a gift.

'Putting it another way, the actions of that split second were the very beat of her life.'

Many floral tributes were left outside the crematorium, including this one of her nickname 'Jazzy'

The Rev Reeder, the chaplain of St Luke's Hospice in Sheffield, added that while people can't bring Jasmyn back what they can do 'is give her a hero's send-off, which is what she deserves.'

After leaving their white roses on Jasmyn's coffin her tearful family left the church to the Macklemore and Ryan Lewis song 'Same Love', a song Jasmyn had on repeat on her iPhone.

Mourners hugged in groups, sobbing as the made their way home and several of the younger people attending the ceremony could be seen proudly wearing RIP JAZZY T-shirts.

Dozens of floral tributes where also left on the ground outside.

Police say the investigation into her death was continuing and they were still trying to find a blue-green Honda Civic with the registration P135 FEO.
