Roger Federer described it as 'good fun', his brutal demolition of Andy Murray on Thursday night in front of nearly 18,000 people at the 02 Arena.

This seemed like Federer's idea of a great evening out, showing no mercy as he ended the British player's season and so nearly provided him with the embarassment of tasting tennis's dreaded 'double bagel' defeat.

Four minutes after Murray had drawn riotous cheers by breaking his duck after losing the first eleven games, Federer formally went through to the semi-finals of the Barclays ATP World Finals, courtesy of a 6-0, 6-1 victory that took less than an hour.

By then everyone had forgotten the evening's original proposition, which was that the 27 year-old Scot needed an unlikely straight sets win to accompany the great Swiss through to the semi-finals.

It had taken just 24 minutes for that to become irrelevant, and soon the question was, numbingly, more whether Murray would win a game.

Britain's Wimbledon champion has not suffered a worse beating since losing as a 16 year-old to someone called Jan Masik at an obscure tournament on Gran Canaria in 2003. He put in such a valiant effort to qualify for this elite field from his post US Open standing, but might have wished he had not bothered.

The abiding image will not be so much of Murray's bemusment but of Federer's relentless pursuit of his quarry, and for all his ageless brilliance it was painful to watch. At 33 he is not sated, although he claimed later to have felt 'uncomfortable' at the end. 'I was happy I didn't win the second to last game to be quite honest,' said Federer. It did not look that way – it looked like he was enjoying himself.

For Murray it was chastening, this ninth and heaviest loss without reply to the three players with whom he used to make up the so-called Big Four.

'It was a tough night, and I have lost Grand Slam finals which have been very tough,' he reflected afterwards. 'He played exceptionally well, I was disdappointed with my level tonight but even if I had played better I would still have lost.

'He was extremely loose tonight after knowing he was through the group and was able to try shots that might not in other situations, everything came off.

'I'm not going to try and forget this, I'll try and use it as motivation for the off season to change some things. It's clear I need to make some adjustments to my game.

The chastening defeat brought the curtain down on Murray's 2014 campaign

'There are some matches when you might have behaved badly or felt like you didn't give it your best and maybe embarrassed about that, but I was trying tonight, there was nothing wrong with me.'

Such commendable honesty will serve him well as he heads into the off season, in which his first duty will be to serve as best man at recently retired British player Ross Hutchins's wedding.

After that he has a lot to do clear the scar tissue from this, and a year which was never likely to be easy following the recovery from back surgery twelve months ago. It is no bad thing that there are two months to regroup before the 2015 Australian Open.

There is no such thing as home advantage when playing Federer in London and, not unexpectedly, the clapometer registered at least as loudly for the Swiss as it did for Murray when they made their customary rockstar entrances.

Jose Mourinho was among those in the house to see the player of the Millennium at the former Millennium Dome, and it was not long before Federer was sealing Murray's fate.

After an even start it was a run of 14 points in the Swiss's favour that settled the first set, Murray powerless to resist his net rushes and panic gradually seeping in. Winning that twelfth game might have felt like winning the clincher against Novak Djokovic in the 2013 Wimbledon final.

Federer has probably succeeded in avoiding Djokovic in the semi-finals, and will likely play him in Sunday's climax. As for Murray, he has to figure out how to bridge the yawning gulf that has opened between himself and the very top players
