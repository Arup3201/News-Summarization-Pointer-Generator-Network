Radamel Falcao's miserable career at Manchester United reached a new low on Tuesday night when he was dumped in the reserves by manager Louis van Gaal.

Falcao has not played a minute of football for United's first team since being dragged off midway through the home victory over Sunderland last month and was left on the bench as Van Gaal's stuttering team were knocked out of the FA Cup by Arsenal at home on Monday night.

Now the £250,000-a-week loan signing from Monaco has suffered the indignity of being made to play in the Under 21 team in their game against Tottenham on Tuesday night.

Van Gaal's decision to select the 29-year-old in the Under 21s is indicative of the United manager's ongoing concerns over the Colombian international's fitness levels.

However, the United boss usually asks senior players to play at this level only if they are on their way back from injury.

Falcao has been injury free since recovering from a thigh injury at the end of November and is unlikely to be pleased at being asked to drop down a level at a time when he is desperately trying to prove he is worth a permanent deal. 

United officials say Falcao, one of the most feared strikers in world football before he suffered a cruciate ligament injury last January, was chosen to ensure he would be sharp for the first-team's clash with Spurs at the same venue on Sunday afternoon.

Sportsmail reported earlier this year that Falcao feels he has to work twice as hard to impress his manager as some other players and has been less than thrilled at times to hear his manager question his fitness levels.

But on this evidence he will do well to win a recall from Louis van Gaal after an anonymous performance.

In a poor first half Falcao dallied too long on two opportunities and his only other action of note came when he deflected fellow striker James Wilson's goal-bound effort wide from an offside position.

Expertly marshalled by Spurs' centre-half pairing of 17-year-old Cameron Carter-Vickers and South African Bongani Khumalo, 28, the Monaco man cut a desperately frustrated figure.

In the second half he was at it again when he diverted Sean Goss's shot into the arms of Spurs keeper Luke McGee before his disappointing evening came to a merciful end.

In contrast Brazilian right back Rafael, fighting for his future at United, was a standout. He calmly intercepted McGee's throw out before chipping him with his left foot from 30 yards on 33 minutes to cancel out lively Spurs midfielder Kenny McEvoy's opener.

Having only scored four times during his six months at United, the chances of Falcao being retained in the summer are almost nil. United have not seen enough to suggest he will prove value for money in the long run while Falcao feels he has not always been given a fair crack of the whip by Van Gaal. 

After Monday's cup exit against Arsenal, Van Gaal reacted with irritation when asked about the decision to sign Falcao and release Danny Welbeck last August. Welbeck returned to Old Trafford to score the winner in Arsenal's 2-1 win.

Last night Welbeck said: 'Manchester United is a club that means so much to me. I'm a fan and it's hard to knock them out. I'll always respect the fans. I had a lovely reception from them and I'm thankful for that.'
