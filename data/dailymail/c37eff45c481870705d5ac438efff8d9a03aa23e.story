A man accidentally shot himself in the buttocks last night at a Nevada cinema during a screening of The Bourne Legacy.

The 56-year-old victim's injuries are not life-threatening and no others were hurt in the incident, which took place at a theatre in the city of Sparks.

Police said the man had a permit to carry a concealed firearm.

Bum deal: A man accidentally shot himself in the buttocks last night at a Nevada cinema during a screening of The Bourne Legacy, starring Jeremy Renner (pictured)

The man told officers the gun fell 
from his pocket at about 8.40pm as he was adjusting himself in the seat 
and that it discharged when it dropped to the floor.

Bizarrely for the other cinemagoers at Century 14, he then apologised and left the building before police arrived.

He was later found at a Reno hospital receiving treatment for this wound.

Police
spokesman Sgt Pay Dyer said: 'Witnesses inside the theatre at the time 
the shot was fired stated that a man was adjusting himself in his seat 
when a gun he had on him discharged.

'The man was cooperative with police and admitted that his gun fell out of his pocket and when it hit the floor it discharged.'

The case will be sent to the city attorney for possible charges, authorities said.

Police rushed to the cinema after one 911 caller claimed seven or eight shots were fired. But officers soon established that just one shot took place.

A police statement to RGJ.com said: 'There was no panic in the theatre as only five people heard the shot out of the approximate 30 people in attendance.'

The incident comes less than a month after a shooting at a suburban Denver cinema that left 12 dead and 58 injured.
