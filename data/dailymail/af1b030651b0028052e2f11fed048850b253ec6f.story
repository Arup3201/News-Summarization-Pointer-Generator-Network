A one-armed man in Russia has been filmed being savagely beaten during a road rage attack, despite starting the fight himself.

The fight happened during rush hour in Moscow as two men in a black Audi tried to start a fight with another pair of men sitting in a Lada behind them.

The occupants of the black Audi, Nikita Korolev, 43, and Kiril Stepanov, 45, were travelling along when a taxi tried to pass them coming in the opposite direction.

With no room for the taxi to pass, Korolev wanted to reverse back up the street but was blocked by a Lada car right up behind him.

After angry words were exchanged, the frustrated one-armed Audi driver and his companion decide it is time for firmer action.

They get out of their car and walk over to the Lada and begin punching and kicking the occupants through the open windows.

But once the Lada driver and passengers get out, they quickly turn the tables, dragging the one-armed man to the floor, kicking him in the head and pulling his fake arm off.

But the tables are quickly turned as the Lana driver comes out swinging, dragging the one-armed man to the floor (left) and forcing the other attacker to flee (background, in the light shirt)

Yuri Stepanovich, who caught the punch up on his dash cam, said: 'It was really funny.

'The Audi guys, perhaps thinking they were better because they have this big flash car, obviously weren't expecting the Lada crew to fight back.

'But when they got out of the car, which had been kicked and bashed along with them, they turned the tables and gave the duo a pasting!

'They ran back to their luxury car like schoolboys and locked the doors.'

After the scuffle had finished  the taxi moved back, allowing the Audi driver to make a quick exit.

The fight ends as the Lana driver delivers a savage kick to the one-armed man's head while he lies on the floor after having his false arm pulled off
