Career change: Nadine has swapped the House of Commons for the Australian jungle

Tory MP and I’m a Celebrity star Nadine Dorries has a secret lover – a vet.

The Member of Parliament for Mid Bedfordshire was suspended by the Conservative Party for jetting off to Australia to star in the reality TV show.

And last week she was accused of being a ‘marriage wrecker’ after having a relationship with a neighbour.

The Sun claim she has been dating Chris Hammond for six months. And he is thought to be in Queensland.

Meanwhile the MP hit back at claims she is letting down the taxpayer by donating part of her £65,738 MP's salary to charity while she appears on a reality TV show in Australia.

The plan to give the money to children's charities in her Mid-Bedfordshire constituency is revealed on her Conservativehome website column.

But she does not mention what she intends to do with her fee from ITV's I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here.

Nadine split from her husband Paul in 2006, choosing her political career over their marriage. Later, she had a fling with John Butler, 57, husband of her neighbour friend of 13 years, Rachel, who branded her a ‘marriage wrecker’
