The Government’s controversial High Speed 2 rail link will be dealt a huge blow tomorrow as MPs demand that the top speed for trains on the line should be slashed by 40mph.

The proposal is just one of a damaging series of criticisms of the £50 billion HS2 project contained in a leaked parliamentary report seen by The Mail on Sunday.

The slower speed would add ten minutes to the predicted journey time from London to Birmingham, making it only 25 minutes quicker than current trains.

High Speed (ish): The journey time from London to Birmingham could be just 25 minutes shorter than it is now under plans to cut the speed of HS2 trains from 225mph to 185mph - to curb emissions

Critics already say that the project is a waste of money and the marginal savings on journey times do not justify the enormous cost.

The Environmental Audit Select Committee’s findings come just weeks before a crucial Commons vote on legislation that must be passed to give the HS2 scheme the go-ahead. The MPs’ report says:

The MPs’ criticisms came as campaigners from the HS2 Action Alliance issued an expert report claiming HS2’s figures on electricity consumption and carbon footprints are ‘highly biased’.

The Alliance says the real carbon impact of Phase 1 from London Euston to Birmingham will be more than double the official estimate and equivalent to the emissions of 1.44 million homes, or 5.4 per cent of households in the UK.

Route: The line will run from London's Euston station to Birmingham on a different route to the one now used

The MPs recommend that ‘the legally binding commitment to reduce emissions makes even a small reduction [in maximum train speed] desirable. HS2 Ltd and the Department for Transport should therefore examine the scope for requiring a reduced maximum speed for the trains until electricity generation has been sufficiently decarbonised to make that a marginal issue.’

Dr Richard Wellings at think-tank the Institute of Economic Affairs, said the new revelations showed HS2 does not make sense.

He said: ‘Already the time savings are quite small. The problem is if they reduce the speed further then the argument that this project is going to give time savings is further diminished.

'The most obvious thing to do to if they’re worried about carbon emissions is not to build it at all. From an environmental point of view it makes more sense to make better use of existing lines.’

Current journey time  1hr 24mins at 118mph

HS2 original plan   49mins at 225mph

HS2 new proposal   59mins at 185mph

Last night environmental campaigners heaped criticism on the Government for its lack of commitment to protecting wildlife and woodlands likely to be affected by the line as it cuts a swathe through some of England’s most picturesque areas.

The Campaign to Protect Rural England (CPRE) accused Ministers and HS2 Ltd of putting profits before conservation.

Ralph Smyth, from CPRE, said: ‘In a bid to pursue economic growth at any cost as quickly as possible, HS2 Ltd has failed to make any changes that would protect the environment.

‘More measures and more funding will be needed if our cherished landscapes, ancient woodlands and wildlife habitats are to be protected.’

And he predicted that with the select committee report ‘the heat’ will now be on Government to respond with ‘credible promises’.

During a month-long inquiry, the Woodland Trust warned MPs that at least 48 ancient woodlands plus protected species such as bats and water rats were under threat.

Wildlife: The move threatens species of bat, water rat and several trees, according to the Woodland Trust

Last night the charity dismissed claims by the Government that such environmental destruction could be offset through the planting of trees and vegetation elsewhere.

The Select Committee’s report will be considered by MPs when they vote on the HS2 Hybrid Bill at its second reading later this month.

This Bill must be passed into law to grant permission to the HS2 scheme, which will eventually see 225mph trains running between London to Leeds and Manchester via Birmingham.

But the HS2 Action Alliance questioned how rigorously routes have been surveyed to assess the environmental effects.

Spokesman Richard Houghton said: ‘There is absolutely no way proper surveying or research of the route could have possibly been carried out to any credible extent in such a short period.

‘The current Hybrid Bill has been described as a developers’ charter because it is laced with clauses  that will allow them to build  on Green Belt and currently protected countryside.’

An HS2 Ltd spokesperson said: 'The levels of environmental protection set out in the Environmental Statement are higher than for any other project of such a significant scale. This includes a commitment to plant more than two million trees along the route of Phase One.

'The committee has acknowledged that the aim of ‘no net biodiversity loss' is a challenging one. There may be opportunities to achieve a net gain as the project develops and these will be considered fully.

'HS2 Ltd acknowledges the need to complete the outstanding protected species surveys as soon as possible and this work continues. We share the committee's regret than some landowners have refused access for environmental surveys and hope they will now grant this access.

'We will contribute to the Government's response to the committee once the entire detail of the report has been given due consideration.'

It would cut speed from 225mph to 185mph, adding 10 minutes to journey

HS2's environmental plans also 'not full enough and could endanger bats'

@highlight

The maximum speed on the line should be cut from 225mph to 185mph to reduce carbon emissions.

@highlight

Environmental surveys on the impact on ancient woods and wildlife have not been carried out on nearly half the land along the route.

@highlight

The scheme’s calculations for its ‘biodiversity offsetting’ plans are not comprehensive and could endanger rare plants and bat species.

HS2 must ringfence a separate budget for environmental protection and monitor measures for 60 years.
