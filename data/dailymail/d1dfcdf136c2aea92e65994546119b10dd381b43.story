The volunteer clown who tragically died of a heart attack during Macy's Thanksgiving parade and his wife of nearly 42 years were 'like peas in a pod,' according to friends of the Yonkers couple.

Irene Blasetti and husband, Robert, 67, had been inseparable since they met when she was just 15 and he was 20, and the annual parade was an event the childless couple always looked forward to.

But this year's spectacle turned to horror when Mr Blasetti suffered a fatal cardiac arrest and crumpled to the ground in front of his wife's eyes at 39th Street and Sixth Avenue in Manhattan, ending their blissful union of almost half a century.

Inseparable: Robert and Irene Blasetti, pictured were inseparable until he died during the Macy's parade

Fighting back the tears, Mrs Blasetti, 62, rushed to her husband's side as he lay on his back in full clown costume flanked by horrified witnesses, including many children.

Dressed in a matching outfit, she desperately tried to administer CPR before paramedics arrived on the scene and transferred the elderly man to hospital where he was pronounced dead.

The couple grew up in Yonkers where, for the past 30 years, Mr Blasetti worked for therapist Akhter Ahsen and his psychiatrist wife Anne Dolan, who had become friends. Mrs Blasetti helped her husband in his role of office manager and research assistant.

Grieving, she did not want to talk about her husband's death.

But Dr Dolan told The New York Times: 'They were like peas in a pod. They did everything together.'

The couple had dropped in to their home on Wednesday evening, Dr Dolan said. Her son, Ossie Ahsen, 43, told the newspaper
that they had been talking fondly about volunteering in the 
Thanksgiving event, which they had been a part of for at least the past 
six years.

Tragedy: Robert Blasetti, 67, was blowing up balloons as a clown on the Macy's Parade route when he abruptly collapsed beside his wife, seen staying by his side in similar costume

'They were telling us about being in the parade, which they loved,' he said. 'It brought them a lot of pleasure.'

Mr Ahsen described his employee as 'the quintessential, jolly, robust New Yorker.'

The Blasettis were among 900 clowns 
recruited to entertain the thronging crowds lining the parade route and 
had been twisting balloons into animals for excitable children when the 
tragedy occurred.

Pulled from her husband in tears, Mrs Blasetti watched as he was transferred by stretcher into an ambulance and rushed to Roosevelt Hospital.

'All of a sudden he collapsed and fell on his back. People came to him right away. It didn't look like he was breathing. People started pumping his chest,' witness Tuvia Yamnik told the New York PostÂ  of the scene.

Macy's spokesman Orlando Veras said 
they were 'saddened to report' that a parade marcher had suffered a 
medical emergency but would not confirm whether Mr Blasetti was a Macy's
employee.

Heart break: His wife was hurried off in tears after entertaining the parade's many children and doing her best to administer CPR to him

Mr Blasetti was an amateur 
photographer and played the guitar, the Times reported, and the couple 
liked to visit the Italian shops and restaurants that line Arthur Avenue
in the Bronx.

Neighbour Luz Montez said that 
during the summer the pair would sit contentedly in deck chairs on top 
of their garage, taking in their surroundings.

'They would sit there and look at the world,' she told The Times.

Tatiana Hernandez, 23, described how 
they enjoyed gardening and that her father, a keen fisherman, used to 
trade his catch for tomatoes from the couple's garden.

The cherished clown was the second person to die at Thursday's parade.

Charles Sutton, 58, a civilian police officer and tow truck driver, also apparently suffered a heart attack before the spectacle even began.

He was pronounced dead at hospital after collapsing while hooking up a vehicle to be towed off the parade route at West 57th Street and Sixth Avenue.
