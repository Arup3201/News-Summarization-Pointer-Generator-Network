It's been 60 years since the world's first successful sex change operation transformed a quiet New York gent into a slender, blonde glamourpuss.

George Jorgensen shocked the nation in December 1952 by returning from a trip to Denmark as a 27-year-old woman named Christine.

Wrapped in a fur coat with eyelashes long, cheekbones high and full lips painted red, Christine resembled nothing of the young man she had been when she departed.

Jorgensen was one of the first patients to undergo both surgery and hormone therapy to change her gender, according to the BBC.

'Ex-GI becomes blonde beauty!' one U.S. headline declared as the news broke.

Jorgensen had a happy childhood, growing up in the Bronx in a close-knit family. But as she reached adolescence, she became convinced she had been born into the wrong body - that of a man instead of a woman.

'The young Jorgensen never identified himself with homosexuality but rather as a woman who happened to be in a man's body,' Teit Ritzau, a Danish doctor and documentary maker who got to know Christine Jorgensen when he made a film about her in the 1980s, told the British broadcaster.

While living as George, Christine said in her autobiography that she felt physically sick when men approached her, despite being attracted to them.

But in the late 1940s, after a short career in the military, Jorgensen read about Christian Hamburger, a Danish doctor who was experimenting with sex change therapy using animals to test hormones.

She booked her ticket to Copenhagen in 1950, convincing her Danish-born parents she intended to visit relatives.

'I was a bit nervous because there were too many people at that period who insisted I was crazy,' Jorgensen recalled years after the operation. 'But Dr Hamburger didn't feel there was anything particularly strange about it.'

Dr Hamburger quickly diagnosed Jorgensen as transsexual and prescribed her a long course of female hormones, encouraging her to take on a female identity for the first time and to start wearing women's clothing in public.

'The first sign was an increase in size of the mammary glands and then hair began to grow where the patient had a bald patch on the temple,' he later said, according to the BBC.

'Finally the whole body changed from a male to a female shape.'

Psychologist Dr Georg Sturup assessed Christine and was quickly convinced that she knew what she was doing.

To proceed, Dr Sturup successfully persuaded the Danish government to allow castration for such medical purposes. It had previously been outlawed.

After taking the female hormones for more than a year, Jorgensen underwent the first of a number of operations to transform her genitals from male to female.

It is unclear exactly what Dr Hamburger and his team did during the surgeries but, according to the BBC, it's likely they followed the lead set by a group of surgeons several decades earlier.

The first attempt at a modern sex change is believed to have taken place as early as the 1930s in Berlin on a patient known as Lili Elbe.

It, however, was unsuccessful and Elbe died of complications during one of the operations. But the medical notes the pioneering doctors made were a helpful guide.

'Apparently the surgery was successful enough for Jorgensen to feel satisfied,' Teit Ritzau told the BBC of Christine's operation.

'There seemed to be no complications and no side-effects from the treatment, which is quite amazing when you think about how primitive things were at the time.'

Christine touched on the results in interviews but never went into detail.

'Everyone is both sexes in varying degrees. I am more of a woman than a man... Of course I can never have children but this does not mean that I cannot have natural sexual intercourse - I am very much in the position right now of a woman who has a hysterectomy,' she said in 1958, the BBC reported.

Luckily, Christine's parents were supportive of her decision.

After the procedure, she wrote them a note.

'Nature made a mistake which I have had corrected, and now I am your daughter,' she said.

Later, she said her mother had always known her son wasn't like the other boys.

When she returned to New York, there was little hostility towards the new-found bombshell. Instead she was greeted with curiosity, fascination and respect by the media and the public.

She became a Hollywood star with theatre and film contracts piling up and invitations to all the most glamorous parties being thrown at her.

Christine was even crowned Woman of the Year by the Scandinavian Society in New York.

Sexual revolution: Christine Jorgensen's sex change was the beginning of the sexual revolution

Trying to explain her sudden popularity, Jorgensen once said: 'I guess they all want to take a peek.'

She made a comfortable living singing and performing around the country throughout the 1960s and 1970s but her personal life was less successful.

Her first serious relationship broke down soon after their engagement.

The next went as far as the register office, only for Jorgensen to be refused a marriage license when she pulled out a man's birth certificate, the BBC reported.

'I haven't found the right fella yet,' she regularly told reporters.

Mr Ritzau believes that, overall, she had a contented life despite her apparent loneliness.

'There had been ups and downs and I think she had a little problem with alcohol, but in the end she was very straightforward, and she told me that the best company she had was herself,' he recalls.

Jorgensen died of cancer in 1989, at the age of 62.

A few years before she passed away, she travelled back to Denmark to reunite for the last time with the doctors that changed her gender and her life.

With good humour, she acknowledged the significance of her operation, nearly 40 years earlier.

'We didn't start the sexual revolution but I think we gave it a good kick in the pants!'
