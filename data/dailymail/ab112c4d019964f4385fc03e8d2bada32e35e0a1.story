So there you have it, folks.

Celtic and Arsenal will play second-leg home ties as they take on Besiktas and Maribor respectively.

Former Chelsea striker Demba Ba will line up for the Turkish side against the Gunners...

That's all from me here folks. Get back to the homepage for post-draw reaction, but make sure you return for the Europa League draw at midday where Tottenham and Hull find out their play-off opponents. See you soon.

...so that means Arsenal fans will have to wait for a minute or two, while Celtic supporters will now find out who their side will face in the play-off round.

...but first, we will watch highlights of Real Madrid's win over Atletico Madrid in last season's final. Oh, and UEFA will also describe how the draw works on stage first - which is fair enough I guess.

No, not the draw itself (that would be too easy.) But UEFA general secretary Gianni Infantino is now on the stage and he is now briefly giving us a speech about how the Champions League pitches the best teams in Europe against each other...thanks for that, Gianni.

The draw should be underway shortly (or at least the presentation) as final touches are being applied in Nyon. UEFA do tend to drag these things out so expect the UEFA General Secretary to give a short speech after he arrives at 11am.

Well, if we are counting the play-off round that is.

Andre Villas-Boas was sacked as Tottenham boss half-way through last season, with Spurs' top four ambitions in pieces before Christmas.

But it's the Portuguese boss who will be looking ahead to compete with Europe's elite this term as manager of Zenit.

Being seeded in the non-champions section along with Arsenal, he will avoid the Gunners.

It's dead simple folks. Balls for the seeded and unseeded teams will be placed in separate bowls. A ball will be drawn from each and placed into an empty pot.

There, the two balls will be shuffled and picked out, with the first team drawn to play the first leg of the two-legged tie at home.

Remember the League route and the Champions route are kept apart throughout the draw.

LEAGUE ROUTESeeded: Arsenal, FC Porto, Zenit , Bayer Leverkusen ,NapoliUnseeded: Athletic Bilbao, Lille , FC Copenhagen, Standard Liege, Besiktas

CHAMPIONS ROUTESeeded: Red Bull Salzburg, Steaua Bucharest, APOEL, BATE, CelticUnseeded: Ludogorets, Maribor , Slovan Bratislava, Malmo, Aalborg.

Many Arsenal fans would favour a clash with Athletic Bilbao, but Arteta has already warned supporters it would be a far from easy clash.

Arsenal will be huge favourites regardless of who they get in today's draw, but Arteta is not getting complacent.

'I wouldn't be very pleased if we had to face them (Bilbao) but you don't know. We're in this position because we couldn't do the business as we had to in the league at the end, and you need to pay a price.

'This is a tricky one and I want us to be ready because for us to play Champions League is vital.'

Hold on to your hats. Before we start talking of a possible Battle of Britain clash between Arsenal and Celtic - both sides will be kept separated for the draw.

Arsenal's play-off route that takes them through a league route (non-champions) while Celtic will feature in the champions side of the draw.

By my calculations, the Scottish champions will be seeded too, which is bad news for Ludogorets who will become an unseeded team. I will confirm that soon.

Well, what a start to the morning!

Despite being given a 6-1 aggregate hiding by Legia Warsaw on Wednesday, Celtic have been given their place back in the Champions League after the Polish champions fielded an ineligible player.

You can find out more details about that on the above link.

You can feel the big time of the Champions League is getting closer as the Premier League now begins its interest in the competition for the 2014-15 season.

Arsenal will find out who they have in the play-off round following the draw in Nyon this morning, but they not be the only British team to feature...

Follow Sportsmail's coverage of the Champions League draw as Arsenal find out who they face in the play-off round of the competition.

The
 Gunners' fourth place finish in the Premier League last term means they
