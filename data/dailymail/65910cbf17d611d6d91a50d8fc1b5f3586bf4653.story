Secretary of State John Kerry said on Wednesday that National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden 'has done great damage to his country' and if he were really a 'patriot' he would 'man up' and come back to the U.S..

Kerry was asked on the Today show about an interview Snowden did with NBC's Brian Williams in Moscow, Russia that airs in full tonight and was released in part last night.

After Williams asked Snowden why he was in Russia, Snowden told Williams he should ask the State Department that question. Snowden said he never intended to stay there but was forced to because the government decided to 'revoke my passport.'

Asked about Snowden's comments, Kerry told Today show host Savannah Gutherie that 'for a supposedly smart guy, that's a pretty dumb answer, frankly.'

Secretary of State John Kerry told the Today show on Wednesday that if Snowden should come home and face the music. 'If he cares so much about America and he believes in America, he should trust the American system of justice,' Kerry said

Snowden leaked thousands of NSA documents last summer to reporters at British-based publication The Guardian.

The former CIA technical analyst and defense contractor gave the reporters permission to print his name, saying 'I have no intention of hiding who I am because I know I have done nothing wrong.'

'My sole motive is to inform the public as to that which is done in their name and that which is done against them,' Snowden told them.

Within a week of publicly revealing himself as the source of the information, the U.S. Department of Justice charged Snowden with espionage, and a week later the State Department revoked his passport.

Snowden was already in Hong Kong when he shared copies of NSA files with The Guardian. He had planned to travel to Ecuador but was detained during a layover in Russia. Without a passport, Snowden was unable leave the airport, and he ended up living there for more than a month. 

The Russian government eventually granted him temporary asylum, and he has been living there since last August. Snowden must reapply for asylum in Russia by the end of July if he wants to stay there.

As of March, Snowden was seeking permanent asylum in European countries, but his efforts have been to no avail.

On Wednseday Secretary Kerry said the U.S. would be 'delighted' to have Snowden back.

'If Mr. Snowden wants to come back to the United States today,' Kerry said on Wednesday, 'we'll have him on a flight today.'

'He should come back. That's what a patriot would do,' Kerry said.

'A patriot would not run away,' Kerry said. 'A patriot would stand up in the United States and make his case to the American people.'

'He can come home but he's a fugitive from justice, which is why he is not being permitted to fly around the world. It's that simple. And he knows it.'

Kerry said Snowden 'stole an enormous amount of information' but it should be up to a court to determine if Snowden has engaged in wrongdoing.

'If he cares so much about America and he believes in America, he should trust the American system of justice,' Kerry said.

White House Press Secretary Jay Carney made similar comments on the matter Wednesday morning to reporters traveling with the president.

Carney reportedly said Snowden 'faces felony charges here in the United States and he ought to return here to face these charges.'

In his first interview with a U.S. TV 
network since leaking information from the NSA, Edward Snowden said many of the terms used 
by the Obama administration to describe him were 'misleading'

In his first interview with American media since fleeing the country, Snowden told Williams that he had a much larger role in U.S. intelligence than the government has acknowledged.

‘I was trained as a spy in sort of the traditional sense of the word, in that I lived and worked undercover overseas - pretending to work in a job that I'm not - and even being assigned a name that was not mine,' Snowden said in a portion of the interview that was broadcast on Tuesday.

Snowden said that in his role at the NSA he 'developed sources and methods
 for keeping our information and people secure in the most hostile and 
dangerous environments around the world.'

'So
 when they say I’m a low-level systems administrator, that I don’t know 
what I’m talking about, I’d say it’s somewhat misleading,' he continued.

On the Today show, Secretary of State John Kerry said he thinks Snowden's 'confused.'

'I think it's very sad,' Kerry said.

Snowden's full interview with Williams airs tonight at 10 p.m. Eastern.
