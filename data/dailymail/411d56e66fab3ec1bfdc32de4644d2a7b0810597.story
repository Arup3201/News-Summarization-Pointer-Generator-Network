'Guilty secret': Tim Loughton said the sexual exploitation of children in Britain had been swept under the carpet for too long

Britain needs an open debate about 'issues around culture' that may explain why men from Pakistani backgrounds are over-represented among offenders prosecuted for grooming white girls for sex, a Government minister has said.

Children's Minister Tim Loughton was speaking a week after nine members of a grooming network in Rochdale were jailed for offences against vulnerable girls aged between 12 and 16.

The men, all but one of whom are of Pakistani heritage, lured their victims off the streets with free food and alcohol before sexually abusing them over a two-year period in flats and houses across northern England.

The trial was the latest in a series of court cases in which men from the Pakistani community have been prosecuted for sex offences against teenagers.

Mr Loughton told a conference on child sexual exploitation, reported by The Times, that the Rochdale case raised 'troubling questions' about the attitude of the men towards white girls.

He said that nothing was gained by 'shying away from taking this issue and debating it head on' and warned that the sexual exploitation of children in Britain had been swept under the carpet 'like a guilty secret' for too long.

'As a result,' he added, 'there was a real and tragic failure to grasp the scale of the problem with awful consequences for hundreds, if not thousands, of children and young people.'

Mr Loughton said the issue was now at the very top of the Government's agenda.

Speaking in the House of Commons during Prime Minister's Questions today, Mr Cameron said he would consider calling for a serious case review into the Rochdale crimes.

He said the gang's victims had 'been brave to come forward and to tell their stories', adding: 'It is a truly shocking case.

'We need to look very carefully at what went wrong.'

Mr Cameron said he had asked for the case to be considered by Education Secretary Michael Gove, who had referred it to the Office of the Children's Commissioner.

The Prime Minister added: 'I think it's important we get to the bottom of a truly, truly dreadful case.'

It has been reported that England's children's homes have seen 631 cases in the last five years of young residents being sold for sex.

Most offenders in other types of sex crime against children - such as online grooming and abuse within the family - are white men, research has found.

Mr Loughton told the Safe & Sound national conference, held at the British Library in London yesterday, that he expected local authorities to take immediate action if there was any suggestion that children in their care were being harmed.

He said it was 'unacceptable' that some children's homes had failed to protect young people.

Concerned: Trevor Phillips said it would be a 'national scandal' if it emerged that social services and schools had not acted on reports of abuse for fear of 'demonising' minority communities

The minister's comments come only days after the chairman of the Equalities and Human Rights Commission, Trevor Phillips said it would be 'fatuous' to suggest there was no racial link in the Rochdale case.

He said it would be a ‘national scandal’ if it emerged that social services and schools had not acted on reports of abuse for fear of ‘demonising’ minority communities.

Nazir Afzal, the Chief Crown Prosecutor for the North West of England, has said the authorities should have acted sooner to protect girls in care.
