When shop owner Lucy Wilkes decided on a window display for her business, she knew it would ruffle a few feathers.

Two vintage, kitsch chairs, standing side-by-side and decorated in pages from Playboy magazines, one of which featured nude women.

However, even she was astonished at the level of controversy the saucy display attracted among visitors to her shop The Print Room, in Lewes, East Sussex.

Public outrage: Designer Laura Diez with her offending Playboy chair at the gallery in Lewes, east Sussex

Near the mark: Officers told Mrs Wilkes her £95 vintage furniture contravened the Obscene Publications Act because it is decorated with 1950s Playboy magazines

She was stunned when police ordered her to remove one of the offending items after a customer complained that it was 'obscene'.

Officers told Mrs Wilkes her £95 vintage furniture contravened the Obscene Publications Act because it is decorated with 1950s Playboy magazines, which features images of topless women.

The astonished retailer was forced to hide the saucy seat at the back of her shop and has now draped it with a public health warning.

The ironic sign reads: 'This chair has been deemed inappropriate for public view. Please take care.'

Designer Laura Diez, who made the chair, insisted her creation was 'tasteful'.

She said: 'I can’t believe anyone in their right mind could actually be offended by this.

'I used 1950s Playboys which are no more scandalous than the front cover of some men’s magazines which are on show in any newsagents.

'It was supposed to be a little provocative but I certainly wasn’t setting out to shock anyone and I’m amazed anyone complained.'

Mrs Wilkes said her husband was running her shop, called The Print Room, when police told him to remove the chair last week.

She said: 'We have had almost entirely positive comments from people apart from one woman who thought it was inappropriate.

'I knew we couldn’t please everybody but then my husband called when I was away from the shop and said he had the police there.

'They said we had to take the chair out of the window because of the Obscene Publications Act. It’s quite hard to know how to respond to that, so I made light of it.

'It was certainly never intended to shock. It’s vintage kitsch.'

A Sussex Police spokeswoman said: 'Police attended a Lewes shop following a complaint from a member of the public regarding an item that was on display in the shop window.

'The member of public was offended by the images displayed on a chair and the shop owner was politely asked by police to remove it from public view, which he voluntarily did.'
