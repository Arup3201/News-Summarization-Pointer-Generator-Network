Glenn Hoddle says he's not surprised by Brazil's utter capitulation in Tuesday's humiliating 7-1 World Cup semi-final defeat to Germany.

The former England international has commented on the host nations defensive frailties in the past, which Joachim Low's side fully exposed in Belo Horizonte.

Brazil's drubbing was the largest ever scoreline in a World Cup semi-final and the 56-year-old believes only Thiago Silva, who missed the game through suspension, is the only capable defender for the host nation.

'For me it was no surprise that Brazil fell apart defensively last night, because from before the tournament started I made the point that Brazil cannot defend. Only the margin of the defeat was a surprise,' he wrote in his William Hill column.

'Three out of their four defenders cannot defend - only Thiago Silva resembled a defender - and with him suspended, I don’t think I have ever witnessed a back line with all four ‘defenders’ unable to defend.'

Hoddle added that the loss of talisman Neymar wouldn't have affected the outcome of the match too differently had he been fit.

The 22-year-old suffered a fractured vertebra during Brazil's 2-1 quarter-final win against Colombia on Friday but Hoddle, who has played for and managed England at previous World Cups, believes the forward's talents would have proved ineffective against the efficient German machine.

'Neymar was a great loss, of course, but not even someone so talented could have done much to help out a non-existent defence, and it was only a matter of time before he couldn’t carry an entire team on his own,' he added.

'Neymar was nowhere near as effective in his last two games and might not have made much of a difference in any case against the Germans.

'The bottom line has been that Brazil sent out an entire back four - all of whom wanted to play on the ball.'
