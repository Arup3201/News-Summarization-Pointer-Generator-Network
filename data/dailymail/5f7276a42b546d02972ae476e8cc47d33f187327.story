Here's how Dwight Gayle scored Crystal Palace's opener at Craven Cottage -          CLICK HERE FOR MATCH ZONE

Felix Magath will look to youth to secure Fulham’s return to the Premier League next season after he was shocked to see his team abandon the fight for survival.

‘I saw Sunderland and Norwich playing at Craven Cottage,’ said Magath. ‘They had much more fight. I asked my team, “What's going on?'” and one player told me, “We cannot fight.” We never fought as a team against relegation.’

Magath was buoyed to witness 21-year-old Chris David rescue a draw at Craven Cottage with a superb strike from distance.

It was Fulham’s last touch of the game and brought the curtain down on a 13-year spell in the Premier League. But the German manager said it pointed the way towards their return.

‘That is the future,’ said Magath, ‘We
 have a good youth academy, but the players have not played much in the 
last few years. I will change that. I will look to bring them into the 
main team.’

The Cottagers 
finished second from bottom with just nine wins.

In contrast, Tony Pulis
 summed up the incredible story of Crystal Palace’s season. He took over
 when they were bottom in November after a 4-1 home defeat by Fulham signalled the end of Ian Holloway’s reign.

‘If
 you'd said to me when I came in that we'd play at Fulham and that would
 be the game that decided whether you stayed up or not, I'd have chomped
 your hand off.’

In the 
event, Palace finish 12 points clear of the drop, having moved nine 
places up the table. ‘The players have had a right go, they didn't put 
their sandals on,’ said Pulis.

Dwight
 Gayle, who was playing in the sixth tier of English football two years 
ago, opened the scoring on 28 minutes, getting the tip of his boot on a 
Joel Ward cross to redirect past keeper David Stockdale from close 
range.

Mile Jedinak, who has
 been key to Palace’s success, limped off after 59 minutes and missed 
his first bit of Premier League football for Palace this season.

Less than two minutes after the Australian left the pitch, Fulham 
equalised when Cauley Woodrow coolly turned inside the box to fire home 
with his left foot.

Gayle 
scored his fourth goal in a week on 83 minutes after his double in 
Monday’s 3-3 draw with Liverpool.

The 23-year-old was released by 
Arsenal aged 12 for being too small but must have felt 20 feet tall as 
he curled a free kick round the wall rendering Stockdale hopeless.

However, David rescued a point and some semblance of respectability for Fulham.
