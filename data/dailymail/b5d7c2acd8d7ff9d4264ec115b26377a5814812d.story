A six-year-old girl was given bread and jam instead of a hot school dinner for two days because her mum was just £4 in arrears.

Hazel Lebby, 37, says she was shocked to discover her daughter Hannah had twice been denied a lunch and has now threatened to take her child out of the school.

St Thomas’s School in Mitcham, Wimbledon, said it needed to take drastic action after parents racked up £1,730 in unpaid dinner meals last year.

Furious: Hazel Lebby, 37, was shocked to discover her daughter Hannah, 6, was given bread and jam instead of a hot school dinner for two days

Mrs Lebby said: 'I was supposed to pay it on Monday but my car broke down so I totally forgot about having to sort it out.

'Then the next morning I woke up with a leak. My carpet was soaking wet. I managed to get her to school on time but had to come back home and sort out the leak.

'I would never in a million years think they would refuse a child dinner because I’m a couple of days late. No one had made an attempt to phone me and tell me my daughter had not been having a dinner.

'The only reason I found out was because my daughter let it out.'

Mrs Lebby, from Mitcham, works for the catering company that provides the school’s dinners at another school.

She received a text from the school to say that because she was in arrears by £4 there 'may not' be a school lunch for her child today.

Big bill: St Thomas's School in Mitcham, Wimbledon, said it needed to take drastic action after parents racked up £1,730 in unpaid dinner meals last year

Her daughter was given a substitute of two slices of bread and jam for two days.

She has since made an official complaint to Merton Council and has said she does not want her daughter to return to the school.

She said: 'I personally feel if they can make a child feel like that then I really don’t want her to go there at all.

'You don’t take it out on a child. All they had to do was pick up the phone and say we have noticed you are in arrears and your child will not be getting a dinner. I would have picked her up or brought down some lunch.'

But the school has defended the decision and the need to take drastic action following the large bill which was racked up on unpaid dinner meals last year.

Headteacher David Feasey said: 'We are liable for those arrears and if parents don’t pay we have to foot the bill and it’s taking money away from resources we could be spending on the children.

'Sometimes people experience difficulties and we can work around that.'

However, he did say he would 'look into' the wording of the text message to make it clear to parents whether their child would be refused a school lunch. 

He added: 'It’s a parent’s responsibility to make sure their child is fed, not the schools. It’s a service we provide but it has to be paid for.'
