Hamilton vice-chairman Ronnie MacDonald claimed he would rather lose Stephen Hendrie for free in the summer than lose him to ‘shambolic’ West Ham now.

A deal to take the 20-year-old full back to Upton Park was all but done at the turn of the year only for representatives of the east London club to fail to put pen to paper.

A furious MacDonald, who believed he had secured a deal that may have risen to £2million, told Sam Allardyce that the deal was off.

‘We’d agreed terms with Crystal Palace for Stephen to go there once the transfer window opened but unfortunately Neil Warnock lost his job so that fell away,’ said MacDonald shortly before the club’s 5-0 defeat to Partick Thistle at Firhill.

‘But prior to that West Ham had expressed an interest so we then opened a dialogue with them. They made an offer which was acceptable and our representatives met with their representatives in London.

‘The fee was agreed, Stephen agreed personal terms through his agent and they were meant to come up on New Year’s Day to sign off the deal and didn’t appear.

‘They then said they would be up on the 4th of Januray but didn’t appear so I just cancelled the deal. I’m getting phone calls from London saying that they want to resurrect it but as far as I’m concerned it’s off.

‘I’m presuming they have seen Stephen playing against Celtic when he did really well for a kid and have changed their mind but I have not changed my mind.

Hendrie has already made more than 100 appearances for the Hamilton first team

‘I’m not concerned about him moving in the summer under freedom of contract because we will be compensated.

‘I always like to deal with add-ons - and with add-ons the fee for Stephen would have been well in excess of £2m.

‘We are sorry for the boy because he’s not getting his big move.

‘I think that West Ham are shambolic and if that’s how they carry on their business that’s up to them, They should do things properly.’

Hendrie started Wednesday night’s game at Firhill but was part of an Accies side thumped by their Glasgow rivals.
