British extremists in Iraq and Syria could be charged with treason if they try to return home, MPs were told yesterday.

Ministers have discussed using the 660-year-old offence, which carried the death penalty until 1998.

Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond told the Commons that video footage of fanatics swearing allegiance to Islamic State provided potential evidence that could be used in prosecutions under the Treason Act of 1351.

Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said the Government had discussed trying ISIS fighters for treason

The last person to be tried for treason was the Nazi propagandist Lord Haw Haw, who was hanged in 1946. The offence was never used against members of the IRA despite its attacks on the British state during the Troubles.

But the offence could be used once again, amid reports that more than 200 suspected extremists have already been arrested in Britain this year – equal to about one a day.

Mr Hammond said ministers had held talks to consider reviving treason – broadly, any attempt to harm or overthrow the sovereign or the Government – under which it is an offence to swear allegiance to enemies of the Crown.

The issue was raised yesterday in the Commons by the Tory MP Philip Hollobone, who called for the offence to be used against jihadists who were fighting British forces and carrying out beheadings of British aid workers.

‘Their actions are treachery against Her Majesty, and aiding and abetting enemies of Her Majesty is one of the greatest offences a British citizen can commit,’ he said.

William Joyce was the last person executed in Britain for high treason. 

Known as Lord Haw-Haw, Joyce was a notorious broadcaster of Nazi propaganda to the UK during the Second World War.

His announcement 'Germany calling, Germany calling' was a familiar sound across the airwaves, introducing threats and misinformation that he broadcast from his Hamburg base.

In 1945, Joyce was captured and returned to Britain, where he was later hanged.

Mr Hammond said he would raise the issue with Home Secretary Theresa May, adding: ‘We have had a discussion about the allegiance question. We have seen people declaring that they have sworn personal allegiance to the so-called Islamic State. That does raise questions about their loyalty and allegiance to this country and about whether the offence of treason could have been committed.’

Supporters of the idea believe it would act as a deterrent to so-called ‘gap-year jihadists’ attracted by the idea of fighting in Syria, as well as taking dangerous individuals off the streets.

At least 500 young British Muslims are thought to have travelled to fight in Iraq and Syria, of which about half of whom have returned to the UK.

Intelligence experts believe returning jihadists now pose a grave terrorist threat to Britain.

The Metropolitan Police’s counter terrorism chief said detectives were now mounting an ‘exceptionally high’ number of operations against plots inspired by terrorism overseas.

Reports yesterday claimed that at least 24 British jihadists have now been killed fighting with Islamic State and other terror groups in the region.

Although treason no longer carries the death penalty and there have been no prosecutions for almost 70 years, anyone convicted could still face life behind bars.

The key section that could apply to British jihadists relates to the requirement of British subjects to give allegiance to the Monarch. The offence has carried an automatic death sentence for most of its history – and for centuries male traitors were hanged, drawn and quartered while women were burned to death. The death penalty was dropped in 1998 to accord with European human rights laws. 

David Cameron hinted at the possibility of treason prosecutions in his speech to the Conservative Party conference earlier this month, calling jihadists ‘an enemy of the UK’. 

Keith Vaz, chairman of the Commons home affairs committee, yesterday indicated that the prospect of treason charges could help act as a deterrent.

He told Mr Hammond: ‘All the evidence is that the more that die, the more that want to go and fight.’ Ministers last considered reviving the treason laws almost a decade ago to deal with the threats posed by Islamic hate preachers. But the idea was eventually shelved.

Suspected extremists are being arrested at the rate of nearly one a day, Britain’s counter terrorism chief revealed last night.

Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley said police are mounting an ‘exceptionally high’ number of operations to thwart terror plots inspired by groups in Syria and Iraq.

He revealed the ‘volume, range and pace’ of work to tackle terrorism has undergone a ‘step change’. Police are foiling ‘several attack plots a year’ ranging from spontaneous attacks by individuals to ‘more complex conspiracies’.

So far this year, Scotland Yard has already made 218 arrests for terrorist-related offences.

Mr Rowley said officers were battling to shut down the flood of online extremist propaganda.

But he also praised the ‘dozens’ of families who had helped police with details about love ones abroad.

‘It is only through courageous action like that that we can help,’ he said.
