Vernon Kay looks ahead to Sunday’s showdown between the Miami Dolphins and the Oakland Raiders at Wembley.

The game is the first of three NFL International Series contests being held in London this season.

The International Series games are completely different from anything that NFL teams are used to. The Wembley atmosphere is something that surprises young players when they walk into the stadium. They think they are walking into an arena where the fans are inexperienced but, in fact, the Wembley fans are just as knowledgeable and more excited than American fans. The veterans who I have spoken to say it is not too dissimilar an atmosphere to the Super Bowl.

As an event, the NFL at Wembley is phenomenal. I’m like a pig in muck because, after watching the Bears win the Super Bowl in 1985, I went to all the pre-season games that were called American Bowls. It didn’t really mean anything but we got to see Joe Montana and Dan Marino on the field for two minutes.

After the London Monarchs and NFL Europe, we have now established Wembley as the home of American football in the UK. We have three games this season and I am hearing we will have five next year. After that, we can start to predict how many season tickets we will sell for an eight-game season.

The Oakland Raiders landed in England on Monday and have been training at Pennyhill Park all week

The Raiders are searching for their first win of the season and fancy their their chances against the Dolphins

There is some talk that the NFL has set a date that there will be a team in London by 2022. I think that gives them enough time to survey, study, and try to judge how much interest there will be in the game. But I still think that it is too far away. Let’s try and take advantage of the momentum we have now.

3 – 40ft containers are shipped from the US for each Wembley game

15 – the number of days it takes for the containers to travel from USA to England

9,600 – bottles of Gatorade are used for each game, 400 cases

8,000- weight in kilograms of gameday equipment used

360 – the number of balls that are shipped to England for use

5,787 – jerseys were sold during two International Series games last season

3,831 – caps were also sold during two Wembley weekends in 2013

There is no expense spared for the fan experience during Wembley week. To take over Regent Street on the Saturday before the game must cost a fortune -they spent £250,000 on banners alone last season.

My first ever American Bowl was in 1986 or 1987 when I literally dragged my dad along to Wembley with my brother. But one thing I have noticed when I sit in the crowd for these International Series games is that it is dads dragging kids. There aren’t many kids at the Wembley games and we need to start encouraging them to come along.

Both the Miami Dolphins and Oakland Raiders are struggling. It is a very similar situation to when we hosted the Minnesota Vikings against the Pittsburgh Steelers last season. Both teams weren’t doing very well and it turned out to be one of the best games we have had at Wembley. I am hoping that will be the same on Sunday. The Dolphins are one of the most supported teams in the UK so there will be plenty of their fans there.

Ryan Tannehill has all the talent and will be looking to bounce back after a turbulent week with the Dolphins

I think Miami’s issues lie with their offensive line. They are not strong at all and Mike Pouncey has injured his knee. He is a real loss for them. But they still have issues at quarterback, too. Ryan Tannehill has shown great promise but is still inconsistent. I played golf on Friday with Dick Anderson - a member of Miami’s 1972 undefeated team. He said that the problem the Dolphins have got is inconsistency and that they don’t have any real leaders to take them forward.

For the Raiders, I don’t think Derek Carr at quarterback is a solution. But they have got that thing the Raiders have always lived and breathed on is that they bring in experienced and veteran players.

I met Charles Woodson on Wednesday and he is really charismatic. He was saying it is really different for them to come over here and play football on foreign soil. The set up is different and it is a different experience for the guys, but they are trying to embrace it as, in Woodson’s words, “an opportunity to get that first W”.

The Dolphins flew in on Friday and they will not have acclimatised as well as the Raiders. They practiced in 90-degree heat in Miami earlier in the week, but they are coming to Wembley where it will be overcast.

I think the Raiders will win. I have got a feeling that everything that has gone wrong for them so far this season will come right on Sunday.

Meeting Menelik

Menelik Watson and Vernon Kay chew the fat

I met Menelik Watson for the first time on Wednesday and he said he has got 30 or 40 family tickets for the game because a lot of them have never seen him play. Physically, he is massive. I put some pictures of us on Instagram, and he is an absolute monster.

He enjoys American football because of the physical aspect of it. I watched him at practice as I wanted to see how he was getting on. He really stood up for himself.

I was really surprised how good he was because, considering he hasn’t played a lot of football, technically he is quite good. He is quick and has fast hands, which is what you need as an offensive lineman and he just needs to learn the game.

He is really proud to be representing Great Britain and is doing massive things. The process of player selection is quite elitist because if you don’t get into college then it is hard to get into the league. But there has to be a way for international players with the physical abilities and the right attributes to be American football players to get onto teams.

Watson embraces Vince Wilfork after the Raiders sank to a narrow 16-9 defeat to the Patriots last week

Quarterback showdown

In the Sunday night game on Channel 4 between the New Orleans Saints and Dallas Cowboys, we have got two great quarterbacks with very different public opinions.

Drew Brees has won a Super Bowl with the Saints and is a record breaker. It seems that whenever we see Brees play, he is always breaking records. It just shows what a good quarterback he is.

The incomparable Drew Brees leaves the field after leading the New Orleans Saints to victory over the Vikings

Tony Romo's season has been plagued by turnovers as the inconsistent Cowboys bid to improve their fortunes

On the flip side, we have Tony Romo for the Cowboys. I was never a big Romo fan but this season I have started to feel a bit sorry for him. If you watch him, you can tell how frustrated he gets. Romo has got a brand new offensive line and it’s taking them some time to bed in.

When I saw them against the 49ers they were very good against one of the strongest defenses in the league. But with Romo, it’s not his highlights that are under the magnifying glass, it is his mistakes and interceptions that everyone picks up on.

Channel 4 will broadcast live coverage of the Miami Dolphins against the Oakland Raiders from Wembley Stadium on Sunday night as well as the New Orleans Saints against the Dallas Cowboys. Vernon Kay presents NFL: The American Football Show, Mondays at 11pm on Channel 4.
