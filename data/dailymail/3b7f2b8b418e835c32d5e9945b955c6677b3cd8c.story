Of all the extreme ways to make yourself look younger, this might just be the most bird-brained.

A British spa is offering a new anti-wrinkle treatment in which clients pay £180 to have nightingale droppings smeared on to their skin.

The unusual facial is already popular in Hollywood, with Tom Cruise among those who swear by its effectiveness.

Unusual: The anti-ageing treatment made from nightingale droppings

A new anti-wrinkle treatment is on the market in which clients pay £180 to have nightingale droppings smeared on to their skin

The 51-year-old actor started the treatments two years ago, and believes they have dramatically improved his complexion.

Other fans include Victoria Beckham, 40, who began having the facials after a visit to Japan.

Billed as an alternative to Botox injections, the droppings – which are collected on the Japanese island of Kyushu – are mixed with rice bran and water before being applied as a mask and left to soak into the pores for an hour.

They contain enzymes which are said to break down dead skin – restoring complexions that have been damaged by ageing and sun exposure – and were traditionally used to help Japanese geisha remove the thick white make-up they were expected to wear.

Hollywood actor Tom Cruise is among those who swear by its effectiveness

The mixture apparently does not smell of excrement, but is said to have a musty odour.

Emma Hu, director of the Spa to You centre at the Hilton Hotel on London's Park Lane, said: 'The nightingales were fed on caterpillars that eat from plum trees.

'Clients are intrigued, but after the hour-long treatment users say it gives a shimmery, iridescent effect to the skin.'
