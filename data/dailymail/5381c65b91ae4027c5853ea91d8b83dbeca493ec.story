Bobby Petrino, the star coach of the Arkansas Razorbacks football team, was fired Tuesday after a horrific motorcycle crash revealed his affair with a 25-year-old staffer.

Officials say he handpicked Jessica Dorrell, a former volleyball player at the university, for a $55,735 a year job with the football program and also gave her $20,000 cash during their relationship.

Because he was fired for misconduct, Petrino, 51, forfeits his $3.53 million salary and $18 million he would have received for early termination.

He is married with four grown children. It's unknown how his wife, Becky, plans to respond to the affair. Dorrell is also in a relationship. She is engaged to Josh Morgan, a swimming coach at the university, and has a wedding scheduled for June.

Petrino never disclosed his conflict of interest in hiring Dorrell or the payment to her, athletic director Jeff Long said. And he ignored multiple chances to simply come clean.

'He
made the decision to mislead the public, (and it) adversely affected 
the university and the football program,' Long said, choking up at one 
point as he discussed telling players that their coach was gone. There 
was a 'pattern of misleading and manipulative behaviour to deceive me.'

Petrino hired Dorrell for a job with 
his football program that started March 28, four days before the fateful
motorcycle accident in rural Arkansas.

She was previously for the first 
female fundraiser for the Razorbacks Foundation, the charitable arm that
raises money fro the university's athletics program.

He picked her out of 159 candidates in a time frame 'shorter than our normal affirmative action hiring process,' Long said.

He never disclosed the conflict of interest.

Additionally, Long revealed, Petrino gave the woman a $20,000 cash 'gift.' The details of the payment are unknown.

Long wouldn't say whether Dorrell was still employed or what her future with the university would be.

Also unknown is the status of her relationship with her fiance, Mr Morgan. He has been with the university's swimming and diving team for two years as an assistant to the head coach.

Dorrell has gone into hiding after the affair went public. 

'She's in safe mode right now,' a former volleyball teammate said.

'Everyone has made mistakes. Everyone has dirty laundry, but not everyone has their dirty laundry shown on national television.'

Petrino's firing was yet another abrupt end for the coach, who had built Arkansas into a Southeastern Conference and national power over four seasons, including a 21-5 record the past two years.

But Long made it clear that the success on the field was overshadowed by repeated deceptive acts and that no one was more important than the program itself.

Long said Petrino was fired 'with cause' – meaning he will not receive a multimillion-dollar buyout – and there were no discussions about ways to keep Petrino at Arkansas. Long declined comment when asked about Dorrell's job status.

Petrino finishes his tenure at Arkansas with a 34-17 record in four seasons, leading the Razorbacks to a No. 5 final ranking last season and a Cotton Bowl win over Kansas State.

The April 1 accident left him with four broken ribs, a cracked vertebra in his neck and numerous abrasions on his face.

The avid motorcycle rider said the sun and wind caused him to lose control on the windy two-lane highway about 20 miles southeast of Fayetteville.

What he failed to mention, both at a news conference and to Long, was the presence of Dorrell.That revelation was made public when the state police released the accident report.

Petrino informed Long of Dorrell's presence 20 minutes before the police released the report to the public, also admitting to what he called a previous inappropriate relationship with Dorrell.

Long placed Petrino on paid leave later that night, saying he was disappointed in Petrino and promising to review the coach's conduct. He said his review found that the relationship between the two had lasted a 'significant' amount of time.

As the review continued, the state police released the audio of the 911 call reporting Petrino's accident. It revealed Petrino didn't want to call police following the crash, and a subsequent police report showed he asked police if he was required to give the name of the passenger during the accident.

Petrino was forthcoming about Dorrell's name and presence with police, but only after misleading both Long and the public during his news conference. That led to the school releasing a statement from Petrino's family the day after the accident that said 'no other individuals' were involved.

The proved not to be the case and the fracture in trust, along with questions about Dorrell's hiring by Petrino to be the school's student-athlete development coordinator, proved to be too much for Petrino to overcome in Long's eyes.

Petrino took the school to its first BCS bowl game following the 2010 season, losing in the Sugar Bowl to Ohio State, and improved his win total in every year. Arkansas was 5-7 his first season in 2008, 8-5 the second before finishing 10-3 and 11-2 during his last two seasons.

The coach's tenure with the Razorbacks began under a cloud of national second-guessing following his departure from Atlanta 13 games into the 2007 season. His tenure with the Falcons was the shortest for a non-interim coach since the 1970 NFL-AFL merger.

His departure was so sudden that Petrino left farewell notes in the lockers of the Atlanta players rather than telling them of his resignation in person. 

He was introduced later that night as the new coach of the Razorbacks, carrying with him a vagabond image after holding 15 jobs for 11 different programs/organizations in 24 seasons.
