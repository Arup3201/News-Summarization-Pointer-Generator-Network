Aston Villa manager Paul Lambert is confident of a speedy comeback to first team action for Christian Benteke after the Belgian returned to light training on Monday.

Striker Benteke, who scored 11 goals last season and 23 in the 2012-13 season for Villa, has been out since April with an Achilles injury.

While Villa have enjoyed a fine start to the season with three wins and a draw, Lambert is eager to get Benteke back in the side.

He said: ‘I’m delighted with the efforts of the medical team here at Villa for working incredibly hard with Christian to get him back to fitness so quickly.

‘Christian trained today, though it was a light session. Hopefully, with no effects from that, he’ll train again tomorrow with the group.

‘Obviously, we’ll be monitoring his fitness and we’ll continue to build him up towards a return to the team.’

Villa also have striker Libor Kozak due to return from a broken leg in the next month, but may be spoilt for choice up front running into winter.

Gabriel Agbonlahor and Andreas Weimann have each scored two goals already this season, while Darren Bent is also back in the first-team having been outcasted last term.
