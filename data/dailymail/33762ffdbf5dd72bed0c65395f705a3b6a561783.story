Moeen Ali had to wait a long time before his sceptical captain gave him a proper bowl on Sunday. But in wrestling back a Test that had been slipping from England’s grasp, he soon showed he might become more than just a bit-part spinner.

Alastair Cook has made it clear with his sparing use of Moeen in this two-Test Investec series that he remains far from convinced the Worcestershire all-rounder is the man capable of stepping into Graeme Swann’s massive shoes. It seemed almost in desperation that the England captain finally threw him the ball with just over an hour of the third day to go. He had given Moeen just one over before then in Sri Lanka’s second innings on this dry Headingley pitch.

A Test that England had dominated for most of the first two days was slowly being turned on its head by the Sri Lankan giants Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene, and Cook’s need of a breakthrough was becoming acute.

Key wickets: Moeen looks determined after taking the wicket of Sangakkara for 55 runs

Short stuff: Diminutive but hugely experienced, Mahela Jayawardene withstood some aggressive bowling

Hal a job: Jayawardene acknowledges his 50 milestone but will be key to Sri Lanka setting a big total

Enter the man the New Road marketing 
men call the ‘beard that’s feared’. Sangakkara, who had just become only
 the fourth man to record seven consecutive Test scores of 50 or more, 
was in the mood to turn what might be his last Test innings in England 
into something considerably more substantial.

Yet
 Moeen, who had dismissed Sangakkara for his first Test wicket at 
Lord’s, quickly made him his  second victim when one of the greatest of 
all batsmen played him the old-fashioned way with his pad rather than 
bat, and was lbw.

Cook could
 easily have then taken Moeen off to attack Lahiru  Thirimanne with 
either of the men who have tormented him in this series — Jimmy Anderson
 and Liam Plunkett — but he kept his spinner on and was immediately 
rewarded.

Thirimanne was 
dismissed for two and two at Lord’s and was out first ball in the first 
innings here.  Perhaps ominously, with Rangana Herath due to bowl last, 
Moeen got appreciable turn and Thirimanne was bowled by a beauty to  
complete his pair.

It was 
two wickets in three balls for Moeen, and how England needed that double
 strike. When they had battled their way to 311 for three on Saturday 
thanks to Sam Robson’s maiden hundred in reply to Sri Lanka’s 257, there
 seemed only one possible winner of this decisive Test.

Another milestone: Sangakkara earlier reached a record-equalling seventh consecutive half-century

Danger man: The veteran left-hander added 55 runs to his 79 in the first innings

Yet
 the dismissal of Ian Bell, frustratingly strangled down the leg-side, 
was the catalyst for a transformation that saw Sri Lanka take England’s 
last seven wickets for 54 runs and then fight their way to 214 for four 
by Sunday’s close.

Thanks
 to Moeen, England remain favourites but if Sri Lanka can extend a lead 
that currently stands at 106 beyond 200, then a team without a Test win 
since their third in the Ashes last summer at  Durham will be decidedly 
twitchy.

This was 
undoubtedly Sri Lanka’s day from the moment their impressive captain 
Angelo Mathews showed his seamers how to do it by putting the ball in 
the right place at barely 75 miles per hour and letting the conditions 
do the rest.

Mathews, little
 more than an occasional bowler, had struck twice on Saturday and took 
two of the last four England wickets to fall, with the notoriously 
fickle Headingley pitch suddenly resembling a minefield.

When
 England’s last two men in Plunkett and Anderson fell to near-unplayable
 balls, Cook (below) would have been confident that a lead of 108 would 
prove decisive. But his seamers got it all wrong and Sri Lanka displayed
 considerable spirit.

England
 clearly expected uneven bounce but little came when they kept on 
bowling a fraction too short. They did not help themselves with yet 
another fielding lapse, Chris Jordan dropping Dimuth Karunaratne when he
 was on four.

A wicket then 
would have exposed  Sangakkara to the new ball and things could have 
been very different. But Anderson and Stuart Broad, worryingly with five
 Tests to come against India in just six weeks, struggled to make an 
impression and looked out on their feet by the close.

It
 was left to Plunkett, seizing his second chance in Test cricket, to 
take the first two wickets but with Sangakkara and  Jayawardene both 
reaching their half-centuries Cook was running out of ideas before he 
turned to his spinner.

‘It 
was nice to contribute and get us back in the game,’ said Moeen, who 
even bowled his doosra in the seventh of his nine overs. ‘They were 
playing very well at the time and I just tried to bowl as straight as I 
can to Sanga because if you get it slightly wrong he can take you 
apart.’

England still have 
much to do and Jayawardene, almost certainly playing in his last Test in
 England, is still there after surviving a reviewed lbw call from 
Plunkett on 45 that just about went in his favour.

Together
 with Mathews he could yet push Sri Lanka’s lead beyond the 225 which 
they think, with  Herath in their ranks and the pitch expected to offer 
more turn on the last two days, will win them their first Test series in
 England.

It is up to 
England, who squandered seven chances in Sri Lanka’s first innings 
before throwing away their position of dominance with the bat, to make 
sure they make no further mistakes.
