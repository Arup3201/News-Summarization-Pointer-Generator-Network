A man was today arrested on suspicion of trying to abduct a three-year-old British 
girl in the Canary Islands.

A family from Milton Keynes, 
Buckinghamshire, were on holiday in Costa Teguise in Lanzarote when a 
man attempted to kidnap the girl in a shop.

Police were today questioning a 62-year-old man who was arrested in London, after a public appeal was launched by Thames Valley Police.

Location: A family from Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, were on holiday in Costa Teguise when a man, believed to be British, attempted to kidnap the girl in a shop

The young girl's father noticed she was 
missing, left a store and spotted the youngster being led around a 
corner into an alleyway by a man, who was holding her by the hand.

He shouted out and ran up to his daughter, pulling her away from the man who then left the scene.

The
incident has chilling similarities to the disappearance of 
three-year-old Madeleine McCann, who went missing from her apartment in 
Portugal in 2007 and has never been seen since.

The family were on the beach a short 
time later and saw the same man, who spoke fluent English, sitting 
between some rocks and acting suspiciously.

The victimâ€™s father confronted the suspect, but he left before police arrived.

But the quick-thinking family took photos of the man in an attempt to identify him.

The middle-aged man was described as white, with pasty skin, of 
stocky build with broad shoulders.

He was around 5ft 8ins to 5ft 9ins tall, 40 to 55 years old, with short dark hair and a dark moustache

Following the arrest, investigating 
officer Det Con John Swallow said: 'We arrested a man in the London area
in connection with this incident earlier today.

'The investigation is ongoing and I want to thank the public for their continued help.'

The incident happened on January
30 last year, but Thames Valley Police spokesman said the delay in
issuing the pictures was due to Spanish police having to exhaust their 
investigation before the appeal to find the man could move to Britain.

A near six-year search for Madeleine 
has yet to solve the mystery of her disappearance from the Algarve 
resort of Praia da Luiz on May 3, 2007.

There
have been dozens of alleged sightings and leads over the years, but 
nothing has come close to establishing whether she is alive or dead.

In the latest development last month, detectives believe a team of British cleaners may hold the key to her whereabouts.

Owners
of apartments in the Portuguese holiday complex where Maddie and her 
parents, Kate and Gerry McCann, were staying when she vanished have been
asked about cleaners in the area who had a white van.

One
property owner said police told him they are looking for a group of six
to eight British cleaners who drove around the Praia da Luz area in a 
white van, working in holiday apartments.

Operation Grange was set up by the 
Metropolitan Police two years ago at the request of Prime Minister David
Cameron following a plea by Madeleine's parents Kate and Gerry, of 
Rothley, Leicestershire.
