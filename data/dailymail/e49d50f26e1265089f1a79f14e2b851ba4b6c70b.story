Achievement: Gail Sims determination to have a baby lead her to lose 7 stone

A mother's determination to show doctors that she was fit enough to qualify for IVF treatment led her to losing an incredible 7st 7lb.

Gail Sim, 36, from Edinburgh, and her husband Steven, 38, were so keen for their daughter Jasmine, aged six, to have a little brother or sister that after trying to concieve naturally they decided that their only option was IVF.

By the winter of 2009 Steven and Gail Sim had been trying for a baby for a year and sought options for IVF at a private clinic. The fact they already had a daughter made them eligible for NHS funding. 

But the couple were told that at 17st, Gail was too fat for treatment.

Gail said: 'We had fertility treatment when we were trying to conceive the first time around, so I knew what to expect in terms of tests and preparatory medication.

'But the doctor said I couldn't even start on the medication until I lost 3st. He wasn't able to prescribe the course of treatment to people over 14st. 

'My heart sank as I thought it would be impossible to lose that much. It sounded like a very daunting target.

'We had our heart set on having another baby. We'd always said we wanted two children. The thought of not being able to fulfil that dream was quite devastating.'

Gail, a secretary, had attempted diets 
with little success, and was worried she wouldn’t be up to the challenge
 set by the doctor.

But determined to give her daughter a sibling, she embarked on an amazing turnaround which saw her shrink down to 9st 7lbs.

She said: 'I felt other people were destined to lose weight if they wanted to - but not me. I'd tried slimming programmes, calorie-controlled meals and simply cutting down on food.

'But the pattern was always the same - I'd lose a little bit only to eventually put on more than I'd lost.'

Gail's habit of eating convenience foods had seen her reach 17st, requiring her to wear size 24 clothing.

She recalled: 'I ate easy-to-prepare meals when I got home from work. Being in a loving relationship with Steven I had become comfortable. We ate a lot of pizzas.' 

Her weight gain had stopped her from 
enjoying having her photograph taken, and she shied away from looking at
 snaps from family holidays.

She
 said: 'I didn't enjoy meeting new people because I was worried about 
what they would think of me and I didn’t like being in a situation where
 someone had a camera out.

'There's a photo of me taken at a theme park in Florida, with me standing by a character from Monster's Inc, which I find very depressing.

'I remember feeling at the time that being in the fun park with my family, I couldn’t do all the activities that I wanted to do. I even worried about fitting into plane seats.' 

Following her appointment at the 
fertility clinic in November 2009, Gail was inspired to succeed this 
time and threw out all the convenience foods and tailored her lifestyle 
towards healthier options.

'I
 thought, ‘either I do it, or live with the regret of not having a 
second child’. I knew I had to go all-out to lose the weight.

Gail's diet saw her go from a size 24 to a slender size 8 and she is determined to keep it that way

'Shortly after I made the changes, I saw how quickly my weight dropped off, and it spurred me on.'

Before beginning her weight loss programme, Gail typically ate a large bowl of cereal for breakfast, followed by a couple of cheese rolls with crisps and a bar of chocolate for lunch and a pepperoni pizza with chips for dinner. She would snack on biscuits throughout the day.

After making the decision to slim down, she ate a grapefruit for breakfast, followed by crispbread with cheese and two apples for lunch and a baked potato with tuna filling for evening meal. She also joined a gym and began exercising weekly.

'At one point I thought I was forever 
destined to be the size I was. I’ve proved that’s not true. It’s all 
about what you eat and having the willpower to make changes'

In May 2011, Gail stepped on her scales to discover she had reached 9st 7lb - a total weight loss of 7.5st. She had shrunk from a size 24 to a slinky size 8. She was approved to receive the IVF treatment that month.

She said: 'It all came off in the last six months - at first I was losing weight but it wasn’t noticeable. Towards the end it was quite dramatic how much I changed.

'Being approved for treatment was incredibly exciting. I never thought I’d be able to get to that point.'

In July, having been through so much to have the chance to undergo treatment, Steven and Gail Sim were disappointed when they were told the round of IVF hadn't worked. 

But just two months later, their frustration turned to joy when Gail made the shock discovery that she and Steven, a nurse, had conceived naturally.

In April 2013 Gail’s efforts were rewarded with the arrival of their second daughter Saffron, now 9 months old.

Saffron
 was born five weeks prematurely but, after a week of monitoring in 
hospital, the elated couple were finally able to take her home to meet 
her big sister.

Gail said: 'Saffron is lovely, happy and healthy. She’s crawling around everywhere at the moment. Jasmine is over the moon - she loves helping me out with her.'

Today, Gail remains at 9st 7lb after she managed to lose the 7lb of baby weight she put on while carrying Saffron.

She said: 'I’m miles more confident and much happier. At one point I thought I was forever destined to be the size I was. I’ve proved that’s not true. It’s all about what you eat and having the willpower to make changes - noone else can make those sorts of decision for you.

'The key is making a decision, and being strong enough to see it through.'
