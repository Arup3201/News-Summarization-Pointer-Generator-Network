The Bundesliga is just edging out the Premier League as the best in the world - according to the number of players left from each league in the World Cup.

England's top division had been storming ahead in these stakes but Germany's progression to the semi finals has helped put the Bundesliga on top heading into the last four.

Italy's Serie A trails behind with 14 representatives while Holland's win over Costa Rica has helped boost the Eredivisie numbers to 10.

Two steps from glory: Manchester City's Zabaleta has been ever-present for Argentina

Bayern Munich are still the top club around - with a total of nine men helped by their six starters in the German side, but the likes of Chelsea and Manchester City are not far behind.

Most surprisingly, Dutch runners up Feyenoord are the second-best represented with five players - all in Louis van Gaal's Oranje squad

Only 20 sides now have two or more players left in the World Cup, and the Premier League boasts four of those: Chelsea, Arsenal, Manchester City and Swansea.

But while there might be more German-owned players left - those from English clubs still have some of the biggest roles to play.

Tim Krul came off the bench to inspire Holland's penalty shootout win against Costa Rica - and Oscar and Willian will be the key men in Brazil's attack with Neymar ruled out.

In terms of the most successful final for the English sides, a Brazil v Holland showpiece in the Maracana could see as many as 12 Premier League players on show - if the Dutch fielded both Krul and Swansea's Michel Vorm.
