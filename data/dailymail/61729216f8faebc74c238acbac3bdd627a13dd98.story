It is one of the wealthiest streets in the world and you could get your hands on one of the sought-after properties... if you have a spare £65million in the bank.

Dubbed 'Bilionaire's Row', Bishops Avenue, in Hampstead, north London is home to Saudi princes, members of the Brunei Royal Family, entrepreneurs and celebrities.

But today a new generation of multi-millionaires are preparing to move in snapping up the chance to get their feet on the super-rich property ladder as a number of houses have come on to the market.

For sale: Carlton House in Bishops Avenue is currently on the market for offers over £15million. The Saudi Royal Family have just sold 10 of their properties in the street for a reported £80million

The tree-lined street connects the north side of Hampstead Heath at Kenwood to East Finchley.

Bishops Avenue lies on the boundary of the London boroughs of Barnet and Haringey.

The street is named after Bishops Wood which runs through the avenue.

It was historically owned by the Bishop of London until the Church of England sold most of the land in the 20th Century.

Many of the houses are inspired by the designs of ancient Greece and Rome, while others draw inspiration for traditional English country estates.

In the 1980s average property prices exceeded the £1million mark.

In 2006 the smallest houses were selling for £5million.

In 2008 one of the most prestigious addresses, Toprak Mansion, sold for £50million - making it one of the most expensive homes in the world.

The road is mentioned in Elton John's 1988 reworking of Give Peace A Chance, 'Why not talk about Bishop's Avenue,' and 'I've got a lovely house on Bishop's Avenue.'

For many of the residents, such is the size of their wealth, that they rarely spend time living in their extravagant mansions.

Focusing on expanding their property empires the wealthy home owners rarely sell up, leaving it difficult to get hold of one of the 66 mansions in the street.

But in recent months the Saudi Arabian Royal family is understood to have sold 10 houses in Bishops Avenue.

And property website Zoopla currently has
 28 homes in the street listed for sale ranging in price from 
£1.9million to £65million - an average of £15million per home.

The Times reported the Saudi Royal family's properties have been sold to LJ Capital for around £80million.

The houses, most of which have never 
been lived in, sit on a five-acre estate, which LJ Capital plans to 
develop into a luxury mansion and apartment complex.

Trevor Abrahmsohn, of Glentree 
Estates, who has sold many houses on the avenue, told the Times: 'The 
Bishops Avenue is a cross between a country estate and a town residence.

'The prince can live next to the pauper here as there is such a spread of (house) values from £100million down to £1million.

'Bishops Avenue is so interesting that if it didn't exist you would have to invent it.'

For sale: Property website Zoopla currently lists 28 properties in the street for sale. This nine-bedroom mansion can be yours for a mere £34million

Mansion: The sprawling home features nine bedrooms, eight bathrooms, a ballroom, swimming pool, gym, steam and sauna rooms

Ancient inspiration: Many of the mansions are inspired by the buildings of ancient Greece and Rome, while others were built in the style of traditional English country estates

Vast homes: In the late 1980s the price of homes in Bishops Avenue exceeded £1million. Today the largest homes fetch £65million upwards while apartments can be snapped up for a cheaper £1.9million

Average property prices in the street surpassed the £1million in the late 1980s and each home sits in a two to three acre plot.

In 2006 the smallest houses in the 
road were regularly selling for around £5million, while one of the  most
 opulent residences, 30,000sq ft Toprak Mansion was sold by Turkish 
tycoon Halis Toprak amid great secrecy to the President of Kazakhstan, 
Nursultan Nazarbayev.

The 
property sold for £50million in January 2008 - making it one of the most
 expensive houses in the world, according to Forbes magazine.

The
 avenue is named after Bishops Wood, which runs through it, and was 
formerly owned by the Bishop of London following a land grant in 704.

In
 1894 the Church of England allowed for the construction of homes on the
 road and in the 20th Century much of the land was sold off by the 
Church.

Today, just one house on the road - 46 Bishops Avenue - and a nearby residential home are owned by the Church.
