Financial downturns and stock market decline could make us ill, several studies have found.

The recession appears to have had an impact on our health with both hospital admissions and minor issues increasing during the period.

Google searches for stomach ulcers and headache symptoms increased during the recession, as well as hernia and chest pain.

By analysing online queries between December 2008 and December 2011, researchers found a significant rise in searches for stress-related illnesses.

The US study, published in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine, saw an increase in Google searches for stomach ulcer symptoms by 228 per cent and headache symptoms by 193 per cent.

It also found that U.S. Google queries for psychological distress increased by 16 per cent for each one per cent increase in home foreclosures month-on-month.

‘By the end of the great recession in 2011, queries were still substantially higher than before the recession,’ Author Dr John W. Ayers, a research professor at San Diego State University, said.

‘People were not getting better with the economy. People were potentially much sicker.’

Another US study has found that hospital admissions increase when stock market drops.

Finance professors Joseph Engelberg and Christopher Parsons at U.C. San Diego compared the state of the market with California hospital data between 1983 and 2011.

People admitted during economic downturns particularly complained about anxiety, depression or other conditions of mental or emotional stress, KMBZ reported.

The study found that ‘one standard deviation drop in U.S. stock prices (roughly -1.5 per cent) increases admissions to California hospitals by about 0.26 percent over the next two days.'

A third study in North Carolina from 2010 showed that the market crash in 2008 was associated with a large increase in heart attacks, concluding that the state of recession also had an impact on our physical health.
