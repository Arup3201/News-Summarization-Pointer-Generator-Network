Somber: Rosie Perez was stone-faced as she left her Brooklyn, New York home on Friday, January 16, after Variety revealed she was leaving The View. However, ABC executives have been quick to deny the rumor

Rehearsals: Rosie Perez has been on hiatus from The View while she works on her new play, Fish in the Dark, starring Larry David 

Rosie said she would be going to watch her felllow Rosie in the play, Fish in the Dark, starring the Curb Your Enthusiasm actor and creator.

She spoke out amid days of confusion and rumor after it was reported that Rosie Perez, 50, had been fired from the ABC daytime show.

The actress is currently on hiatus while she rehearses for her play, but insiders said she had never adjusted to either the show's format of discussing hard and soft news - and had trouble reading a teleprompter. 

A source on the set of the ABC show also told The New York Daily News: 'She’s constantly correcting herself because she’s constantly screwing something up. She’s not the sharpest tool in the shed.'

Those remarks drew the ire of a group who call themsevves #YoSoyRosie.

The group have put out a letter defending Rosie against the criticism that has been heaped upon her.

The letter, which was obtained by TMZ, said that 'questioning a woman's intelligence is an old stereotype that is sexist and in this case also racist'.

The letter added that 'when you disparage the only Latina on The View, you disparage all Latinas'.

Among the group members are New York City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito and NY Secretary of State Lorraine Cortes-Vazquez and best selling author Esmeralda Santiago.

Rosie was added to the line-up at the last minute by the show’s new executive producer Bill Wolff as Rosie O'Donnell made her highly-publicized comeback - and also joined politico Nicole Wallace.

However, last week,Variety reported Rosie would not be returning to The View as the producers wanted to find a younger host to replace her.

ABC has now dismissed the rumors, as a spokesman said: 'We look forward to welcoming the multi-talented Rosie Perez back to her seat as co-host on the panel on Feb. 3 after completing rehearsals.

Debate: Rosie Perez joins her View co-stars and singer Jessie J. ABC denied she had been sacked, releasing a statement last night that said: 'We look forward to welcoming the multi-talented Rosie Perez back to her seat'

'She brings her rich life experience and passion to the table, something we've sorely missed while she's been away.'

Last week, Variety also reported The View's CBS rival had edged ahead in total viewers for the first time. 

The five-year-old CBS talkshow edged ahead in total viewers, 2.95 million to 2.88 million, according to Nielsen estimates for the week of Jan. 5-9. This is the largest audience for “The Talk” since last February.

And in an apparent dig at the rival program, Rosie cut to commercial today with 'This is The Talk', before quickly correcting herself and saying, 'No, The View'.
