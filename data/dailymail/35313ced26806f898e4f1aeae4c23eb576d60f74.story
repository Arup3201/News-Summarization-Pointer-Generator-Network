UEFA have announced the 2015-16 Champions League final will be held at Milan's San Siro stadium.

The San Siro, occupated by Serie A giants Inter Milan and AC Milan, last held a Champions League final in the 2000-01 season, when Bayern Munich and Valencia played out a 1-1 draw before the Germans won on penalties.

The San Siro stadium is home to Inter Milan and AC Milan, and has a capacity of 80,000

It also staged the 1965 final between Inter Milan and Benfica and the 1970 final between Feyenoord and Celtic. 

This season's final will be held at Berlin's Olympic Stadium for the first time since its renovation for the 2006 World Cup finals.

Basle's St. Jakob-Park, with a 38,000 capacity, will host the Europa League final. The Swiss ground held six European Championship games in 2008. 

The UEFA Super Cup match will be in Trondheim, Norway at the Lerkendal Stadion.
