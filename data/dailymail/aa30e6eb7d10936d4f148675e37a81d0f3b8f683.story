For Britain’s Got Talent contestants, it was their first chance to impress the nation on live TV.

But for viewers at home, the excitement of this week’s semi-finals was somewhat dimmed – by the constant advert breaks.

The ITV programme has been hit with complaints after almost a quarter of its first two live shows were taken up with commercials.

End of the line: Dance troupe CountryVive were eliminated on Monday night's show

Some fans joked they only tuned in for the adverts and were upset when these were interrupted by the occasional contestant, while others resorted to recording the show and fast-forwarding though the breaks.

The first semi-final on Monday night, which saw singing group Collabro and Canadian magician Darcy Oake put through to next week’s final, was watched by an average of 9.1million viewers – down almost 700,000 on the same episode last series.

Many viewers reacted furiously on Twitter when they realised the 90-minute programme was saturated with six advert breaks, taking up almost 20 minutes of screen time.

One fan, Chris Lee, said: ‘Britain’s Got Talent has more adverts than acts! Sort it out #ITV #BGT becoming a bloody joke!’

Winners: Singing group Collabro won the public vote

Another, Katie Purkiss, tweeted: ‘Britain’s Got Talent? Not sure about that, but it’s definitely got adverts.’ And Carlton Cole joked: ‘Don’t you hate it when you’re watching adverts, and suddenly #BGT comes on.’

Others said they decided not to watch the show live and record it instead. It meant that although they could not vote for their favourite acts, they were able to fast-forward the adverts and enjoy the show uninterrupted.

The half-hour live results show – which aired after Coronation Street at 9.30pm – was watched by 7.8million viewers on Monday night, meaning 1.3million decided not to stay up to find out who won.

It contained a further eight minutes of adverts.

Like magic: Darcy Oake narrowly ousted impressionist Jon Clegg

Collabro won the public vote and Oake – who admitted this week he could understand why some fans are upset BGT contains a string of foreign acts – narrowly ousted impressionist Jon Clegg.

Despite the best efforts of the nine contestants, the part of the show that generated the most comment online was Amanda Holden’s revealing dress.

Over the course of the week, 45 acts will be whittled down to the final 10. The winner will be chosen on June 7.

Tonight’s show will see burlesque dance troupe Crazy Rouge take on a group of French drag artists for a coveted final spot.

Last night an ITV spokesman insisted the BGT semi-finals have the same number of adverts as other ITV programmes of the same length.

He said: ‘The number of minutes of advertising shown in Britain’s Got Talent was no more than is usual in a programme of its length and was fully compliant with allowances stipulated in the Ofcom Code on the Scheduling of TV Advertising.’
