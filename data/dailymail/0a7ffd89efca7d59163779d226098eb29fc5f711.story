President Obama has paid tribute to President Kennedy at the Medal of Freedom ceremony today as he presented awards to former President Clinton, Oprah Winfrey, country singer Loretta Lynn and newspaper editor Ben Bradlee.

In his opening remarks, Obama highlighted the slain President’s sister-in-law Ethel Kennedy, calling her ‘one of my favorite people’ in a room full of dignitaries. He went on to also give President Kennedy’s grandson Jack a shout out by praising his basketball skills.

Aside from the fact that the 50th anniversary of President Kennedy’s assassination comes this Friday, the Democrat was mentioned because he was the one to establish the Medal of Freedom initiative which is the highest civilian honor in the country.

Presidential pals: Even though President Clinton criticized President Obama's health care roll out just a few days ago, the two seemed very comfortable with one another at Wednesday's ceremony

Quite the crowd: Six fellow honorees and President Obama clap for Clinton as his son-in-law, daughter and wife (bottom left) look on from the front row

Happy to be there: Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was one excited attendee and she and daughter Chelsea were in the front row to watch Bill receive the medal

His death on November 22, 1963 came two weeks before the first group of winners were due to receive their medals.

President Bill Clinton is far from the 
first former Commander in Chief to receive the award- in fact all but 
four Republicans: Presidents Nixon, Ford and both Bushes- have been 
granted the award by their predecessors.

Back in public: Huma Abedin, Mrs Clinton's longtime aide, was also at the ceremony after staying out of the public eye following her husband Anthony Weiner's failed mayoral bid

When the list of this year’s 16 nominees was released in August, it was seen as a turning point in the Clinton-Obama relationship as the two Democrats started off at odds when Obama ran against the former President's wife Hillary in 2008 in a campaign that often times turned personal.

Over the course of the past five years, the two men have worked hard to mend their relationship but there have been a few bumps in the road between the nominations and now.

A tell-all book about the 2012 election revealed that Obama reportedly told aides that he could only take Clinton ‘in small doses’, and just last week Clinton returned the favor by publicly criticizing the Obama administration’s roll out of the national health insurance program.

They made an effort to hide any hard 
feelings today, however, as Mr Obama spoke movingly about his fellow 
Democrat. While was light-hearted during his remarks about the other 
recipients, he made a point to slow down and take a more emotional tone 
while praising Mr Clinton.

Wowing the women: Among this year's 16 recipients were a number of female leaders including Gloria Steinem (left) and Oprah Winfrey (right)

All smiles: Wednesday's award ceremony showed that in spite the fact that Oprah did little to campaign for the President in 2012 (even though she was one of his strongest advocates in 2008) there are no hard feelings

Look of approval: Former President Clinton looks up at Oprah as she receives her award

Big day: President Obama gives former President Clinton the highest civilian honor after praising him for his service and philanthropic work that helped save 'hundreds of thousands of lives'

Proud: Hillary Clinton got a brief shout out from President Obama as well, as he thanked former President Clinton for being patient while his wife traveled all over the world as his Secretary of State

Mr Obama said that he appreciates the former President’s advice ‘on and off the golf course, and most importanty for your lifesaving work around the world which represents the best of America.’

He went on to give Mrs Clinton- who is widely expected to be the Democratic presidential candidate when Mr Obama’s second term ends in 2016- a shout out as well.

‘I am most grateful for (Bill Clinton’s) patience during his endless travels of my Secretary of State,’ he said.

Mrs Clinton and their daughter Chelsea were in attendance at the ceremony held in the East Room of the White House. Mrs Clinton’s embattled aide Huma Abedin was also at her side, making a rare public appearance following her husband Anthony Weiner’s failed New York City mayoral bid.

Other political players with close ties to the President were selected, including the late Senator Daniel Inouye, the former Hawaiian Senator who Obama eulogized at his 2012 funeral and called 'my earliest political inspiration'.

In her place: Astronaut Sally Ride, who died in the Challenger explosion, was given the award posthumously to her life partner Tam O'Shaughnessy, who had been romantically involved with Ride for 27 years

Bringing it home: Country singer Loretta Lynn was praised for breaking boundaries in the music industry

Respect: In talking about the well-known women- including Gloria Steinem- President Obama said that they did so much to help young girls like his daughter see new role models

Former Republican Senator Richard ‘Dick’ Lugar was also honored on Wednesday. Obama co-sponsored a bill with Republican Senator Richard 'Dick' Lugar and they have remained close to this day.

Lugar was such an influential figure to Obama that during the final presidential debate in 2008, Obama cited Lugar as one of the people 'who have shaped my ideas and who will be surrounding me in the White House'.

Former Washington Post editor Ben Bradlee, who came to fame with his work during the Watergate scandal, was another notable inclusion. The President joked that in addition to Mr Bradlee’s military service and important work in the media, he was also jealous of how the editor is able to pull off fashion-forward shirts with white collars.

‘He always looks so cool in them,’ Mr Obama joked.

Old friends: Senator Richard Lugar and Obama worked together when he first entered the national political scene and the Republican from Indiana took the Illinois-transplant under his wing

Partners in stride: Mrs Obama also attended the ceremony but she did not speak

Not to be outdone, the vertibale ‘Queen of all media’ was also a recipient of the storied award.

Oprah Winfrey has been a longstanding supporter of the President, though many believed that their relationship may have soured after she did little to endorse him during the 2012 re-election campaign and skipped his second inauguration entirely.

No tensions were present on Wednesday, however, as the President said ‘Michelle and I count ourselves among Oprah’s many devoted fans and friends.’

‘Early in Oprah Winfrey’s career her bosses told her to change her name to Susie I often pause there because I got the same advice- not to Susie but to change my name,’ he said. 

Other key female leaders were among the honorees including women’s rights campaigner Gloria Steinem and astronaut Sally Ride, whose award was accepted posthumously by her life partner.

Country music singer Loretta Lynn and Judge Patricia Wald who served on the International Criminal Tribunal were the two other female recipients.
