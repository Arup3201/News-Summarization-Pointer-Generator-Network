Not content with carrying out an ingenious escape under the noses of their zookeepers, a pair of runaway monkeys is trying to break back in.

Only this time the mischievous monkeys are attempting to find their way into people’s houses.

The capuchin monkeys left staff at the South Lakes Safari Zoo red-faced over the weekend when they each managed to escape on subsequent days.

And now the primates have sparked a police search operation after they have been seen loitering in gardens and trying to make their way into families’ houses.

Zookeepers have yet to track down the miniscule animals despite reported sightings across Dalton-in-Furness, Cumbria, close to where the zoo is based.

The monkeys, which are known for their cunning and intelligence, have even been spotted sitting nonchalantly outside pubs at night.

While the animals do not provide an immediate risk, police said they may bite or scratch anybody who approaches them.

It is still unclear how the monkeys managed to escape from the zoo, which is home to more than 1,000 animals.

A young female monkey was reported missing on Saturday and was shortly joined on the run by another monkey that escaped on Sunday.

Pictures have appeared online showing the animals sitting on a garage and at the side of a road.

But the zoo’s hopes of finding the monkeys will be buoyed by the success of a similar operation only four years ago.

On that occasion a three-year-old capuchin called Tony went on the run for five days.

He was eventually caught by the zoo’s owner David Gill wandering around in a local graveyard.

Capuchin monkeys are best known as the breed used by organ grinders.

Their intelligence means that they can even be trained to perform household tasks and are often used in laboratories.

The animals, which are only 40cm tall and weigh between 1.3 - 4kg, are native to South America – predominantly the Amazon rainforest.

Donna Martin, who spotted the first escapee running along pavement in the town centre, said: ‘I was surprised and worried that it would get run over.

‘From a distance I thought it was a young cat as it was slim and moving quickly, but as I drove closer I realised that it wasn’t. I hope it gets back to the zoo OK.’

A spokesman for Cumbria police said: ‘Police were called today at 9.11am with confirmation that a second monkey has escaped.

‘This follows a juvenile female Capuchin monkey that escaped at the weekend and has been sighted in the Dalton-in-Furness area.

‘These animals do not pose an immediate risk to the public, however it is capable of biting or scratching anyone who attempts to approach it.’

An incident at the 17-acre zoo, which first opened in 1994, was the subject of an inquest last month.

Animal keeper Sarah McClay, 24, was mauled to death by a tiger that had access to a restricted corridor in which she was standing.

She had been working in the supposedly safe keeper’s corridor, from which she could access the tiger pens through metal doors, which were bolted shut.

But the inquest was told that a bolt on a door between the tiger’s pen and the corridor used by keepers had been ‘defective’.
