When Jennifer Devitt discovered she was pregnant with her second child in quick succession, she decided to take a preventative strike on her mummy tummy.

‘I’m a size eight and have always had a flat stomach, but when I had my first daughter I found it really difficult to get it back,’ says  Jennifer, 29, a beauty therapist and mother to Indie-May, 20 months, and Holly, four months.

‘My muscles were non-existent, everything stuck out and it was six months before I could wear a T-shirt because of my jelly belly. I felt really self-conscious and didn’t even like looking in the mirror.

‘I knew that with your second baby everything can really go haywire because your muscles are already weakened, so I started looking for something to help.’

The big squeeze: Anna and her corset

To most women, that might be a gym membership, a sharp swerve away from the biscuit aisle in the supermarket or a brisk walk with the buggy each day. But, like a growing number of mothers, Jennifer wanted results more quickly than that.

Shopping in Mothercare, she chanced upon what she saw as a solution to her problems — a Belly Bandit. This is a huge band of thick, strong elastic that’s worn around the midriff after pregnancy and promises to shrink the belly, waist and hips.

It is also said to remind women to tighten their core muscles, to reduce swelling and stretch marks, and support the spine. Similar compression garments are called The Cinch, the Squeem and the Gowri wrap.

The trend is huge in the U.S. and is becoming popular here, despite warnings that it can be damaging to women’s health.

Jennifer strapped herself into the Belly Bandit just three days after giving birth.

‘I wore it day and night — I was pretty determined. And it was so expensive, around £70, that I wanted to get my money’s worth,’ she says. ‘I found it comfortable and even slept in it. My partner, Wesley, didn’t mind it.  He knew I wanted to feel good in my clothes.’

Jennifer, who lives in the Home Counties, says she was ‘gobsmacked’ at  the results.

‘Within two weeks I was a size ten and could wear a tight T-shirt. I really noticed the difference in my abdominal and pelvic-floor floor muscles, even though I wasn’t doing any exercise.

‘It took me six weeks to get back to a size eight and a weight of eight stone. I never thought it would be so dramatic.’

Belly-binding is rooted in ancient tradition. In Japan, the Middle East and South America, it is normal for women to wear a compressing wrap, corset or girdle to speed up their return to their pre-pregnancy size.

Its revival in the West has been fuelled by celebrity endorsements: the actress Jessica Alba credited her enviably tiny and toned post-baby body to wearing two corsets, one on top of the other, day and night, for three months.

Kourtney Kardashian and Minnie Driver sang the praises of the Belly Bandit while Angelina Jolie and Gwen Stefani wore The Cinch, a £75 wrap available in upmarket maternity shops. 

While there’s no doubt shapewear can make lumps and bumps appear to vanish, some experts warn against squeezing your post- pregnancy body back into shape.

Some obstetricians in the U.S. say women are risking stress incontinence, digestion problems and weakened back muscles.

Nicky Croft, a women’s health physiotherapist at the APPI Clinic in Hampstead, North London, says: ‘After giving birth, the uterus is still enlarged and the whole of the abdominal wall has lengthened and stretched throughout the pregnancy.

‘This will return to normal, but it takes time. The evidence shows that the best way to reduce abdominal distension is breast-feeding and specific exercises to strengthen the abdominals during and after pregnancy.

‘A belly-binder won’t help you lose baby fat — the only things to affect that are your metabolism and diet. If you bind the abdominal wall too tightly, you’re putting your pelvic floor under pressure, which could lead to urinary leakage. The pelvic floor has just been through a big stretch, so the last thing it wants is to be pressured.’

Gwen Stefani wore The Cinch which is a £75 wrap sold in upmarket maternity stores to help her return to her pre-baby shape after she had given birth

The other concern is that belly binders take over the job of the tummy muscles, meaning deeper, core muscles become lazy.

‘If you give too much external support to the stomach, the abdominal and pelvic-floor muscles will be deterred from working as well,’ says Croft.

‘So, in the long term you might become reliant on wearing the wrap to keep yourself supported, rather than retraining your core muscles to do it.’

Kathryn Lister tried two belly binders  following the birth of her daughter Daisy.

‘As I’m 41, I was aware my body could go south after I had a baby,’  says Kathryn, who works in  finance and is married to Simon, 45.

‘The rest of me is fairly flabby, but my stomach has always been flat. So I really wanted to try to hold on to it. I was reading online mothers’ forums and saw all these mentions of belly binding.

‘I remember reading about Jessica Alba doing it and that really stuck in my mind. I ended up buying The Cinch and some Squeem shapewear.’

Two days after her daughter was born, Kathryn strapped herself into The Cinch, but struggled to get used to it.

‘Daisy was born on one of the hottest days of the year, so it was uncomfortable. It was also very obvious. If I was wearing anything other than a thick shirt or jumper you could see it under my clothes.

‘It’s recommended to wear it for 18 hours a day, which seemed like madness.

‘In the end, I had to take it off every time I wanted to feed Daisy because I simply wasn’t comfortable sitting in it.’

After two weeks, Kathryn decided to try the Squeem, a girdle that runs from under the bra to the bikini line.

‘This was even worse. It had hook and eye fastenings, so it took ages to put on and bits of you spill out. The fat has got to go somewhere, hasn’t it? I looked like an overstuffed sausage.’

Yet the internet is awash with ‘miracle’ stories about women racing to get back into their pre-pregnancy clothes. Mother-of-two Anna Blakey wore a compression girdle after her two pregnancies.

‘I’m a small build, so I didn’t put on much weight, but my muscles were weak and I was looking for something to support my back,’ says Anna, 40, a graphic designer who lives with her husband Dominic, 45, a sales director, and their children in South London.

‘I loved the feeling of support and confidence it gave me and people were amazed when I was back in my size-ten jeans within two weeks of giving birth.’

When Anna had her son, now three, she had to have an emergency Caesarean. Without discussing it with her midwife, she used a girdle designed for  post C-section bellies, with side-fastening eyehooks.

‘It sat smoothly over the scar and made all my clothes more comfortable. I think it also helped the scar to heal, in the same way that if you cut your finger you put pressure on it,’ she says.

Anna still occasionally wears her compression garment. ‘I will put it on if I want to wear a certain dress. It helps cinch in my waist and tum.’

At 13 inches, Ethel Granger’s waist was the smallest ever recorded. She appeared on the  cover of Italian  Vogue

However, despite such reports, the belly-binding trend worries midwives, who feel women are under too much pressure to snap back into shape after pregnancy.

Janet Fyle, who leads the Royal College Of Midwives’ policy on obesity and maternal public health issues, says: ‘It is far better to lose your pregnancy weight gradually, by eating healthily and taking gentle exercise, such as swimming, with your baby.

‘Women who are pregnant or who have just given birth should be celebrated, not hidden away. We’re at risk of making women feel guilty about their bodies.’

Kathryn, who had suffered an abdominal split  — where the muscles do not reconnect properly after birth — ditched the two different belly binders and saw a physiotherapist.

‘She gave me some Pilates and pelvic-floor exercises, which are helping. I just don’t think there’s a quick fix,’ she says.

And like many new mothers, Kathryn found that the arrival of her little girl signalled a change in her priorities.

‘I haven’t worried about my stomach as much as I thought I would,’ she says.

‘Daisy is my focus. All I cared about was being able to feed her, to cuddle her and feel her skin on mine. Yes, my tummy is probably a bit squishy, but it’s all worth it for her.’
