Last year, the community of Cypress, Texas, was shaken when a family of four was discovered dead in their homes, each killed with a bullet to the head.

Any sense of calm has stubbornly refused to return for neighbors, as police say they still have no leads into who killed Maoye Sun, 50, and Mei Xie, 49, and their two sons, 7 and 9. 

'I hope every time you blink, you see the images of these children,' Harris County Sheriff Adrian Garcia said at a recent press conference.

Quadruple murder: Husband Maoye Sun and wife Mei Xie were found dead last year along with their boys, Timothy and Titus, all of whom had been shot at least once in the head in their bedrooms

'I want you to remember that you killed two children. I want that to burn in your brain. I want you to have no peace in your life until you turn yourself in and confess.'

KPRC reports that the reward for information was raised to $75,000 from $70,000 as the Houston Chinese Alliance and other community leaders try to keep focus on the Sun family.

'The community's disappointed due to the lack of progress,' said the Houston Chinese Alliance's Howard Xu. 

'We urge the community to ask people who have information to contact Crime Stoppers or the investigators.'

On January 30 of last year, police visited the Sun residence after one of the parents were reported to not have shown up for work.

There, Sun and Xie were found dead along with their boys, Timothy and Titus, all of whom had been shot at least once in the head in their bedrooms. 

Pledge: Sheriff Garcia spoke at a press conference announcing a new reward for information leading to the killer after a year with no leads

Family: The two boys had last been seen in school on January 23, a week before the family was found murdered in their home

The Houston Chronicle reported that what was first believed to be a grisly murder-suicide scene was ruled a homicide when police found several of the windows had been broken.

The two boys, students at Sampson Elementary School, had last been seen on January 23.

News of the murders even reached China, where Maoye Sun, who has worked as an engineering analyst at several petroleum drilling companies, was reportedly connected a former Chinese security official currently the subject of a corruption probe, according to KHOU.

'We have received news articles and different emails. We have gone through it all,' Sheriff Garcia said. 'There is a great deal of information we cannot share.'
