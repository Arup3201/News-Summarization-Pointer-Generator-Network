A meeting with Inter Milan stirs youthful memories in John Guidetti. He once wore the famous black-and-blue jersey and dreamed of emulating Zlatan Ibrahimovic.

That fondness for this giant of Serie A could have been cemented when he almost joined their ranks barely into his teens. On Thursday, however, he would simply love a chance to play his part in cutting them down to size.

Guidetti is on a scoreless streak dating back to November, when a goal against Hearts was his 11th in his first 12 games for Celtic.

The Swede, on loan from Manchester City, has been replaced by Leigh Griffiths as Ronny Deila’s first-choice striker.

But he revealed a return to potent form against Inter would carry special significance.

‘They’re one of my favourite teams,’ Guidetti told Italian newspaper Gazzetta dello Sport.

‘When I was little, I supported Inter. I had the shirt, too. I’m Swedish, and Zlatan (Ibrahimovic) was in Milan, so I was at San Siro for him.

‘Once I nearly even joined Inter, I was about 13, I was taken to Milan and trained there. I also played a bounce game against a former club legend, Beppe Baresi I think.’

While Inter may have been a source of inspiration in the past, Guidetti will look to his current surroundings at Parkhead.

A 60,000 sell-out will give the 22-year-old a long-awaited taste of the stadium at its best. Premiership games drawing barely half that number simply aren’t the same.

To Guidetti, harnessing the power of their support will be crucial as Celtic seek to overcome Inter in the first leg of their Europa League last-32 tie.

The striker has plentiful respect for the talent at Roberto Mancini’s disposal, yet is confident Celtic will stand up and be counted.

‘Inter are a very strong team,’ he said. ‘(Xherdan) Shaqiri is great, I played against him in the Feyenoord-Basle match.

‘Hernanes has great technique, and the same is true of (Gary) Medel.

‘They fight from start to finish, but to come to us and win is not easy.

‘Celtic Park will be sold out — 60,000 people.

‘For me, if you take the fans away from football, there’s nothing left.

‘Players come and go, but they (the fans) spend their money to follow the team year after year, and demand only one thing: passion.’

After a brilliant start at Celtic, Guidetti has struggled for goals in recent matches 

Guidetti also paid tribute to Mancini, who he previously worked under at the Etihad Stadium.

The respect is mutual as the Italian spoke recently of his admiration for the forward’s talents, having handed him a first-team break five years ago.

‘I have a lot to thank Mancini for, he gave me my debut in the first team and advised me to go to Feyenoord (on loan),’ Guidetti added. ‘He was right, I had my best season in the Netherlands.

‘I see he has spoken about me recently.

‘He’s different class, just like he was as a player.’

Guidetti was ineligible to play in the Europa League group stage, so any minutes against Inter would provide a chance to showcase his talents against a higher level of opposition than found in Scotland.

It might also attract further interest in his services.

His City contract expires at the end of the season and talks about a longer stay at Celtic have been postponed for the time being.

Guidetti insisted he has no idea about his next destination but revealed that Inter were not the only Italian club to want him in the past.

‘At the end of the season I’ll be a free agent, with no contract,’ he said. ‘I’m a Celtic player now, it’s impossible to say where I’ll end up.

‘Italy? I was close to Samp(doria), I trained with them at 15, in the Primavera (youth squad) once and in the first team once. It was the team with (Vincenzo) Montella and (Antonio) Cassano.

‘I liked everything, then (Sven-Goran) Eriksson brought me to City.’
