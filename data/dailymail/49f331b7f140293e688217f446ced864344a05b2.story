James Bond actor Sir Sean Connery warned an author not to take LSD because he had experienced a bad trip when he tried the hallucinogenic drug himself, it was claimed today.

Irish writer Edna O'Brien said that the former 007 star advised her against trying the drug.

She claimed that the Scottish actor told her how his trip with psychiatrist RD Laing had a 'freight of terrors'.

Sir Sean has never spoken publicly about his involvement with Laing, who became an icon of the 1960s counter-culture movement after he argued that LSD had therapeutic benefits.

However, the actor's first wife, Diane Cilento, has previously alleged that Laing persuaded him to take the powerful drug to help him deal with stress after he appeared as Bond in 1964 movie Goldfinger.

Taking LSD was legal at the time. Possession of the drug was only outlawed in Britain in 1966.

O'Brien refers to the episode in her new memoir, Country Girl, according to the Sunday Times.

She describes a conversation she had with the Bond actor in May 1970 when she was planning to meet Laing and take the drug herself.

'I
had learnt from Sean Connery, with whom I had dinner the previous 
evening, that his own LSD trip with Laing — both being old friends from 
Scotland — had its own freight of terrors,' O'Brien writes.

'Yet I did not cancel the appointment. It was as if in some way I believed I could go through with it and yet escape the terrible ordeal.'

O'Brien, who came to prominence following the release of her 1960 novel The Country Girls, writes that, after taking LSD, she had 'hideous' hallucinations which included Laing being transformed into a rat and her kitchen walls into flesh.

She claims that, as she neared the end of her psychedelic experience, Sir Sean came to see how she was faring.

Cilento alleged in her own memoir, My Nine Lives, that Laing, who died in 1989, gave the Bond actor a tab of pure LSD.

'No one was privy to what happened over the next six hours, but I believe that, with his enormous reserve and armouring, Sean resisted the drug,' she wrote.

'As a result, he had to go to bed for several days to recover.'

Sir Sean's agent and publicist is yet to respond to Mail Online's request for comment.
