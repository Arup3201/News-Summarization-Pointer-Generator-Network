Last week, the return of Match of The Day for its 50th anniversary was, for me, all about what it was going to be in the future. 

This week, on the actual weekend anniversary, it was a little more to do with its glorious past. And you have to say, the manner in which they did it, was a nice touch.

Although I wonder whether giving Barry Davies a welcome return to the lip mic for West Ham’s game at Selhurst Park was the most tactful thing to do?

Barry is certainly a veteran commentator, with one of the most engaging voices and sharpest brains there’s ever been in his business. But asking him to commentate on a team who play ‘19th Century football’ (copyright, Jose)? Bit harsh.

Luckily for Barry, though, the Hammers had forsaken their hobnail boots for shooting ones. As a result he had one of the best games in the division on Saturday, into which he could skillfully weave his colours and textures.

To make Barry feel perfectly back at home, the commemorative title sequence features one of his most celebrated moments. ‘Look at his face. Just look at his face’ implores Mr Davies as the cherubic chops of Frannie Lee glow in the wake of a Derby County goal. Yes kids, those are pictures of a former top flight centre forward in England!

What’s more, this week they even threw in a few clips of Gary Lineker’s forebears. Amongst them, Jimmy Hill and Bob Wilson showing the new kids on the block how it’s done in the wardrobe department, with their sporty short-sleeved shirts.

The picture was then completed on the match coverage itself. As we saw the match commentator weave his way to the commentary box, Gary reminded us it was 45-years ago at Selhurst Park where Barry had made his Match Of The Day debut. And we got the graphics such a return demanded. Big ones! BIG WHITE ONES!!

In the second half, when Palace made a double substitution, you had to peer past the letters to see the action.

As for Mr Davies being back at the helm is concerned, it really was a welcome return. The voice may not have the punch it once did, but it was still laden with all the right moves. His immediate reaction to West Ham’s exquisitely volleyed opener was an almost operatic chant of ‘oh, Mauro Zarate’. While for their second, Barry absolutely called it as he suggested out loud that Stewart Downing ‘could have a crack here?’. Spot on, sir.

Clearly Barry still has a youthful enthusiasm for the game. And when he declared at the final whistle it had been an ‘entertaining afternoon’, I’m sure he meant both for himself, and for those watching a fine game of football.

Although I wonder if he thinks there are some things that ain’t what they used to be, but perhaps should? I’m not totally convinced he was all that impressed when he noted Sam Allardyce was on the bench in the ‘tie undone style’. Sort it out, Big Sam!

So a more than welcome reprise for one of the great voices of sport. On a show that also welcomed back to the pundit’s chair the newly bequiffed Robbie Savage. Which I must admit, left me pondering somewhat.

Perhaps I just don’t understand the transfer market for football experts? Only a couple of weeks ago, Robbie was announced as a major new signing for BT Sport. And indeed he has already been turning out for them on his new Saturday Morning show ‘Match Day Live With Fletch & Sav’.

But clearly the loan system in the telly world means you can play for two teams at the same time. Now for me, I’d be wishing my old player the best of luck with his new challenge and look to bring in some fresh new talent who’d be proud to pull on just the ONE shirt. 

But perhaps like Barry, I’m from a different age? And although it may have come as a bit of a surprise to me, as Tom Jones sang at the start of this particularly vintage edition of Match Of The Day, it’s not unusual.
