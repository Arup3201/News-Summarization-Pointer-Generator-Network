The Queen received a rapturous welcome in Brisbane today as she praised the 'resilience and courage' of Australians who endured devastating floods earlier this year.

Tens of thousands of well-wishers lined the banks of the Brisbane River as the monarch and Duke of Edinburgh - aboard a
catamaran - travelled up the waterway that wreaked havoc on the city.

It broke its banks in January and forced thousands to flee their homes during the natural disaster which saw the worst floods in the region for almost 40 years.

But today an estimated 45,000 
spectators lined wharves, jetties and riverside roads to catch a glimpse
of the royal couple as they sailed by in the catamaran Pure Adrenalin to see for themselves where the waters devastated 
homes and livelihoods.

Their
destination was the South Bank district of Brisbane, a mix of 
apartments, offices, shops, galleries and a feature rainforest area, 
that suffered £7.8million (AUS$12million) worth of damage in the January floods.

Among the survivors they met met were two little koala evacuees.

The tale of Nivea and Sprite was a little light relief to the stories of
the loss of lives, homes and businesses.

When the floodwaters struck, the marsupials were removed from the Lone Pine
Koala Sanctuary in Brisbane where they were born in captivity.

They were introduced to the Queen when she toured the Rainforest Park area of the South Bank.

Nivea, nine, and Sprite, eight, were held by sanctuary staff
Karen Nilsson, a senior wildlife officer, and wildlife manager Jacqui 
Brumm.

Because the animals were bred in captivity, they are accustomed to being 
around people and are often brought out to meet VIP guests.

The Queen asked about the flooding and if it affected the animals, and was told by Ms Brumm: 'They had to be evacuated to higher ground 
behind their home, Lone Pine was inundated (with water).'

As the two women chatted, one of the koalas munched away on eucalyptus leaves, oblivious to the royal presence.

During
a speech to launch a new water storage facility in the city that will 
provide irrigation water for the rainforest, the Queen praised 
Australians and the reception she had received.

She
said: 'Today Prince Philip and I have been greeted with great warmth 
and good humour in the true Australian spirit and I have seen the 
fortitude, ingenuity and determination of Brisbane to overcome the 
setbacks of last January.'

In January, the rising tide of brown 
murky water swamped suburbs deluging homes and businesses in Brisbane 
and forcing people to seek refuge in sports stadiums.

At
the height of the flooding three-quarters of the state of Queensland 
was declared a disaster area, 36 people were dead and damage 
across the region was estimated at hundreds of millions of 
Australian dollars.

The Queen added: 'We are here to pay tribute to the resilience and 
courage of Queenslanders who bravely picked up their lives and rebuilt 
them after a period of great adversity.

'This
morning we travelled along the Brisbane River listening to the stories 
of when the river broke its banks, and seeing the vast impact of the 
natural disaster.'

The Queen was given a first-hand 
account of the floods when she met rescue workers, 
survivors and those who lost their homes.

During a reception at an arts
centre in Brisbane, the Queen met Danny McGuire, who lost his wife, 12-year-old 
son and five-year-old daughter when a flash flood hit the town of Grantham,
Queensland.

Mr McGuire
described how his wife and children tried to shelter in a fire engine 
but drowned when the cabin filled up with water.

The father, who was with his only surviving child Zac, seven, said: 'She mainly asked me how did I lose my family.

'I
said in the fire truck. She asked did we have any warning and I said we
did try to evacuate Grantham the night before and we got told to stand 
down.'

The Queen recycled an outfit from her wardrobe yesterday when she stepped out into the sunshine in the
primrose yellow dress she wore to the wedding of the Duke and 
Duchess of Cambridge.

She had chosen the single crepe wool 
dress and matching coat and hat, designed by her personal assistant 
Angela Kelly, when she attended her grandson’s wedding in April.

The only difference was that, with temperatures close to 30c, the coat was missing.

Appropriately, the dress features hand-sewn beading at the neck in the shape of sunrays.

The famously thrifty Queen is known for recycling her outfits - she has often asked Angela Kelly and her team of seamstresses to 
change the decorations on gowns in accordance to latest fashion trends. 
Or perhaps to keep costs down.

Scores of well-wishers greeted the Queen on Sunday when she attended a service in Canberra at the historic St John’s Church.

Close to 1,000 people had gathered 
around crash barriers erected close to St John the Baptist church, and 
when the royal couple arrived they cheered
and clapped.

The service was held behind closed 
doors with more than 100 people attending, including former 
Australian prime minister Kevin Rudd.

If a Sunday falls within an overseas 
tour members of the royal family regularly attend an Anglican service in
whichever city they may be visiting.

Mr McGuire, a member of the fire service, said meeting the royal couple was a rare happy moment.

He said: 'It was really good for Zac, when the Queen came around to shake his hand, he hid behind me. My spirits were lifted for Zac, it's going to be something he is going to remember.'

The Queen and Prince Philip also met 
Sarah Norman, whose parents drowned when floodwater gushed through the 
Lockyer Valley in south Queensland.

Carrying
her three-month-old baby, Eleanor, she told the Queen how her mother 
and father - Steve and Sandy Matthews - were overwhelmed by flash 
flooding.

She said afterwards: 'Our property got hit by five different bodies of water, we were the first to get struck.'

Ms Norman said the Queen expressed her sorrow and asked how old the baby was.

During the reception, the Queen listened closely to people's recollections and told one guest how she was shocked when she saw the floods on television.

'They were alarming pictures,' she said.

Gwen Braga, who badly injured her leg in the floods, was forced to take a seat shortly before meeting the Queen.

She said: 'She was so gracious and so understanding and I thanked her for coming because it meant a lot to our community.'

British migrant Jill Ashmore, who comes from Woking, said the hidden tragedy of the disaster was the number of people who had committed suicide since the floods.

She said: 'I know eleven people within my Brisbane suburb who have killed themselves.

'People lost not only their houses but their business and many didn't have insurance - they just could not see hope, that was the problem.'
