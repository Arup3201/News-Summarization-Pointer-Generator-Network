A jockey has had a near miraculous recovery thanks to a pioneering new treatment to regrow a finger that his horse bit off as he fed the animal a treat.

Paul Halpern, 33, turned up at the Delray Beach, South Florida practice of Dr Eugenio Rodriguez with a third of his right index finger in a zip-lock bag.

His insurance company wanted medics to amputate the rest of the digit, but Dr Rodriguez instead tested out a unique new procedure to heal it without surgery.

Using a pig bladder the doctor made a template of the severed portion of Mr Halpern's finger then attached it to the stump that remained.

Astoundingly, the finger's cells, bone, soft tissue and even nail regrew into the mould.

Mr Halpern, from New Jersey, had been feeding a treat to his prized horse when he reached a little too far between the animals chomping jaws, costing him the top third of his index finger.

'One of the guys that worked with me reached his hand in the horse’s mouth, took the fingertip out, and I jumped in the car, grabbed the rest of my finger wondering what we should do,' he told CBS Miami.

Although he stopped to put the severed digit on an ice lolly in an effort to preserve it, emergency room medics told Mr Halpern there was no way to re-attach it.

Mr Halpern's mangled finger before the treatment: The procedure involved applying powder made from pulverised pig bladder to the unhealed stump every day then wrapping it in a protective sheet soaked in saline

It was then that he heard of 52-year-old Dr Rodriguez, of the Deerfield Beach Outpatient Surgical 
Center, who had a new way to restore the mangled extremity.

The
procedure, known as an implantation of a xenograph, involves applying 
powder made from pulverised pig bladder to the unhealed stump every day 
then wrapping it in a protective sheet soaked in saline.

'It
stimulates your body to attract your stem cells and then the stem cells
start producing the tissue that is missing,' Dr Rodriguez told NBC Miami.

Despite
the complex science behind it, the treatment was so easy and painless that Mr Halpern was able to do it at home over the course of two months.

'I
couldn't notice at the time but once everything had healed and the 
fingernail grew back, which is quite miraculous, and the skin healed 
over, then you really notice,' the patient said.

Dr Rodriguez, who believes he is the first medic in south Florida to prescribe the treatment, added: 'It’s very interesting to see a patient heal. That’s my passion, wound healing. It is fascinating to have the new results.'

The results could pave the way to using the treatment for worse injuries.

Mr Halpern added: 'I’m really grateful. I think it’s fantastic. I think in the future there’s going to be other uses for it but it wasn’t a life threatening injury to me it was something that was an accident.'
