Luisa Zissman is not one for keeping her opinions to herself and women appear to be the target of her latest outburst as the 25-year-old Apprentice finalist has declared that she 'hates feminists.'

It's a curious admission considering her success on Alan Sugar's reality TV show, in which an equal number of aspiring young businessmen and women vie for the chance to work with the business magnate.

The cake shop owner from St Albans, 
Hertfordshire has defeated 14 other candidates to make it to tonight's 
final on BBC1, in which she'll be competing against another aspiring businesswoman, 24-year-old Leah Totton.

This perhaps explains Luisa's subsequent retraction of sorts, as reported by The Telegraph: 'Okay, I don't hate feminism. I'm totally behind women in business but I just don't think gender should be an issue at all.'

The self-described 'Business Barbie' adds, 'What I've learned through this process is that the general public are quick to say I'm a bimbo when they first meet me. But just because I've got my boobs out doesn't mean I haven't got a brain in my head.'

'I don't think we should be judged for the way we look. They should recognise our business ability and say, "You've done well girls".'

Luisa's stint on the show has been notable for a spate of controversies.

The Sun reported that she had an affair with her married boss when she was a 17-year-old school-leaver entering employment for the first time.

This was revealed shortly after footage was discovered featuring the businesswoman and mother confirming that she had an abortion when she was 16.

And earlier this month it was alleged that Luisa's ex-boyfriend ran a firm of high-class prostitutes and encouraged her to sign up. A source told The Sun, 'Most women would run a mile if they found out their man sold women for sex, but Luisa wasn't fazed in the slightest.'

The source added: 'When her boyfriend saw how accepting she was of his business he asked her if she wanted to give it a go. He knew how popular she would be with his clients so he was very keen to get her involved. But Luisa refused.'

The show assembles candidates into groups that race to complete the tasks assigned them.

And this season hasn't been easy: assignments have included activities like creating and branding their own ready meals, opening and selling a farm shop, and conceiving of a new online dating concept that would withstand the scrutiny of a group of experts.

Based on the strength of her business running two cupcake shops, Luisa hopes to impress Lord Sugar with her plan to launch a range of baking supplies. Competitor Leah hopes her business option - opening a chain of non-surgical cosmetic clinics - will win Lord Sugar's £250,000 investment.

The Amstrad business mogul and his colleagues have expressed ethical concerns about Leah's idea, wondering how honest it is to make money out of 'girls not feeling good about themselves,' as an adviser put it.

This suggests Luisa may be pulling ahead of her adversary; but it's not long to wait before tonight's winner is announced.
