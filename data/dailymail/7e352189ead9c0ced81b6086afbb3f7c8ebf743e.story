Councillors in a seaside resort are hoping to ban naked events over fears the charity fundraisers are scaring away families.

Clacton-on-Sea in Essex has been the venue for a sponsored skinny-dip and a nude bike ride in the past few weeks, with many locals saying the fun events livened up the area.

But the leader of the district council is now stepping in and attempting to block any further naked get-togethers in order to protect the town's 'image'.

Protest: Dozens of cyclists took to the town's roads to demonstrate against the dangers of riding bikes

Last month, more than 100 people stripped off and went for an early-morning dip in the sea on a Clacton beach to raise money for Marie Curie Cancer Care.

And on Saturday, around 35 naked cyclists took to the town's roads in protest against the dangers faced by bike riders - and the organiser plans to hold the event again next year.

Peter Halliday, Conservative leader of Tendring District Council, railed against the nude events and vowed to stop them happening again.

'Clacton is a traditional family seaside resort and in my opinion people riding around on bikes with no clothes on does nothing to enhance our image - in fact it harms it,' he said.

Good-natured: But local councillors have criticised the events because they are not family-friendly

'They did not apply to use land under our responsibility so there was little we could do other than work with other agencies on a bit of a damage-limitation exercise.

'However, I now want to get together with the police and others round the table and come up with a plan to put a halt to naked events in our area before it all goes too far.'

Linda McWilliams, the councillor responsible for health and safety, added: 'I will certainly be bringing this matter up with the police and will suggest that we investigate what we can do in the future to prevent a repeat of what we have witnessed this summer.'

The council singled out the cycle ride as being more damaging than the swim, as it took place in the town centre during the middle of the day.

But Robert Brown, the organiser of the bike protest, insisted he was making an important argument and pledged to attract up to 100 cyclists to next year's event.

'The event was to protest against car culture and the idea of riding naked is to highlight the vulnerability of cyclists,' he said. 'Being naked in public isn't an offence in itself.

'Similar events are held in towns and cities around the world and across the UK in places like Brighton, Portsmouth and London.

'The London event attracts thousands of people and benefits shops and traders in the area.'

The 47-year-old, who is also hoping to break the world record for the largest ever naked fun run, continued: 'There were more people in favour of our event than against it. We got a huge cheer as we rode down the High Street.'

An Essex Police spokesman said: 'There has been a precedent from similar events held in Brighton and London in the past and it was deemed that there were no legal grounds to prevent it going ahead.'
