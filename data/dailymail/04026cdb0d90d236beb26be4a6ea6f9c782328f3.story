A herbal energy drink designed to give men a boost in the bedroom has been banned - because it also contained an erectile dysfunction drug.

MosKa is marketed around its natural 'performance enhancing' ingredients such as Red and Siberian Ginseng.

But its manufacturer has now discovered the drink also contained 'an underclared ingredient' - Vardenafil, or Levitra.

As a result, some men drinking the beverage, called MosKa, were experiencing prolonged erections.

There were also fears they could have experienced the dangerous medical condition priapism. This is where the penis remains erect for longer than four hours and can become permanently damaged.

The drink also contains higher than prescribed levels of the drug  than are prescribed in Australia, where the product is sold.

This in itself is extremely dangerous because erectile dysfunction are usually unsuitable for men with angina or very high blood pressure - and could trigger a heart attack.

Other side effects include heartburn, nausea and headaches.

The Therapeutic Goods Administration has now warned the drink “poses a serious risk to your health and should not be taken”, according to news.com.au

It has now banned the drink and warned that any batches entering the country will be seized by Customs.

But the TGA warns that its supply is now illegal in Australia and it will work with Customs to help stop supplies entering the country.

A notice on MosKa's website reads:  We are devastated to have found that the overseas OEM supplier for Moska energy for adults had included an underclared ingredient, Vardenafil (Levitra), within the natural ingredients. 

'Vardenafil (Levitra) is a prescription only substance. As such, we have terminated the supplier and in the process of producing the product with our own formulation to ensure no hidden ingredients. All our future products will be tested for compliance with all regulations.'
