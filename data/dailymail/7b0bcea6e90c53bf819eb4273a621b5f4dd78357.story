A blind kitten that was rescued after being thrown out with the rubbish has become a social media sensation. 

Quirky the kitten, who has his very own Facebook page with nearly 15,000 likes and hundreds of videos on YouTube, is filmed trying to lick his fur.

But the adorable puss can’t seem to work out where his fur is and licks the air instead. The screen star features in other cute clips showing how he tackles everyday tasks like climbing the stairs.

He was rescued by Frank and Vicky Giannangelo after they found him near the local tip in San Juan Island in the US state of Washington.

The couple took Quirky to a vet who nearly put him down because he was blind and appeared to be suffering from a head wound.

But after falling in love with him, the Giannangelos took Quirky 1,600 miles back to their home in New Mexico where he has become a viral hit.

Vicky said: ‘He wants you to know that blind kittens are amazing pets and are no more trouble than any other kitten.

‘He is a very happy kitty and really navigates well. He will run his ears along a wall until he knows where the doors are.

‘Sometimes he runs into the wall at a full run when he is playing with another kitty, or running around too fast.’
