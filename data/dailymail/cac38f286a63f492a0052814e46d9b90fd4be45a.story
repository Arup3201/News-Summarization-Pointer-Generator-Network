Should a man pay for dinner while on a date with a woman? As if the dating game wasn't difficult enough, this issue has now become a minefield for men and women over the last few years. 

As females fight for equality on all terms, stars like Emma Watson have encountered awkward situations at the end of a meal when they insist on paying their way. 

But others, like Atomic Kitten's Natasha Hamilton say that a man SHOULD look after a woman - in her new blog for Babycentre, the singer explains why Emma's stance on male chivalry is wrong.

Natasha, who is currently dating Ritchie Neville from the boy band 5ive, said: 'What is wrong with a man displaying good old fashioned ‘chivalry’ and feeling uncomfortable that she wants to pay? 

'This is not a weakness on either side, it’s about letting a man be a considerate, generous, kind human being. Why emasculate him? It’s unnecessary.

'This just puts more pressure on women.'

Natasha goes on to point out that the pay gap between women and women is still huge in most of the western world, so through no fault of their own,females bring home much less money than their male counterparts. 

She said: 'I recently took part in the TV show The Big Reunion, which was a great success. 

'But the following year all the female acts got dropped from the tour and all the male acts had yet another opportunity to bring home the bacon.'

Actress Emma Watson recently revealed that she tried to pay for the bill at the end of a date and it made the man feel very awkward 

 Natasha continued: 'There are so many expectations placed on women now. 

'If shows like Ex-On-the-Beach are anything to go by, its common place for lads to think they can “bang” as many “birds” as they want, like we’re pieces of meat.

'This is the cultural shift that is openly part of the youth today. 

'On top of this, now it’s being suggested girls “pick up their own tab”. Well, it just gets rosier for men doesn’t it?'

In fact, Natasha believes that in the 21st Century, it is crucial that men be taught to look after the fairer sex. 

She said: 'I personally think that men should look after women. That is not a weakness. 

'By allowing them to do that, it may create more empathy and stop some men viewing women as “bangable” pieces of meat.

'I fully expect my three boys to be respectful, kind and generous to their future partners too.'
