A civil servant in Mexico has been forced to quit after a web camera recorded him having sex in his office.

Carlos Caamal Reyes, 47, head of the department of Civil Protection in the Emergency Centre of the state of Campeche, in south-east Mexico, told fellow workers he was not to be disturbed because he was in a meeting, and also ordered everyone to take a 30 minute break.

But he then met a woman in his office and a video camera that a colleague had left on by mistake recorded him having steamy sex on his desk for nine minutes.

Carlos Caamal Reyes, 47, head of the department of Civil Protection in the Emergency Centre of the state of Campeche, in south-east Mexico, told fellow workers he was not to be disturbedÂ 

A local police officer who saw the video said: 'It doesn't leave much to the imagination.

'They were clearly enjoying themselves and didn't think about anything but the task at hand.

'But it was not a criminal offence, just one for the council to sort out with their internal disciplinary committee.'

The town clerk, Carlos Moreno Hernandez, 45, said the video camera evidence was proof of 'impropriety' and added: 'Everything inappropriate act has a consequence.'

According to employees, Mr Reyes regularly used his office as a boudoir for his conquests.

The government are investigating who the woman is to find out if she is also a civil servant.

Reyes had been working at the office since 2000.
