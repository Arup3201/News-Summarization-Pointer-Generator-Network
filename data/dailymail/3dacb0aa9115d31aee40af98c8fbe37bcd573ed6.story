Many say Bob Dylan's lyrics are unbeatable.

That was before Bill Murray had his way with them.

In a preview clip from his new movie St Vincent, the 69-year-old actor half mumbles  along to Shelter From The Storm as he tries and fails to water a seemingly dead plant.

And if social media is anything to go by, the rendition is certified genius.

'Legend': Bill Murray is up to his old tricks making the unremarkable completely fascinating in this clip

His bedraggled character Vincent retrieves his cigarettes from inside a plant pot before heaving himself onto a plastic green bench, singing while smoking. 

Slowly, he plods through his movements - absent-mindedly watering a plant that then falls over, throwing away his cigarette before immediately lighting another.

But all the way, he is trying to keep up with Bob's crooning, occasionally bursting out into song when he catches on a line he knows well. 

One fan commented on the video released by the Weinstein Company on YouTube: 'It doesn't get better than this - two legends at the same time!'

Another said: 'Why do I love this? I don't know why I love this. Please someone explain it to me.'

And one exclaimed: 'BILL YOU ARE THE COOLEST DUDE ALIVE.'

'Masterpiece': He half-mumbles, half-wails Bob Dylan's Shelter From The Storm in his movie St Vincent

Multi-tasker: The 69-year-old seems completely at ease trying to water a seemingly dead plant while singing

Performance: It was all for the film but fans have taken the clip as yet another triumph for Bill Murray

Known for being non-chalant and eccentric, this moment that he sees the plant pot fall seems typical Murray 

Soon-to-be-released: Murray stars as a drunk gambler in St Vincent, which comes out on October 24

It is not the first time Murray has excited his fawning fans by turning something completely unremarkable into a work of art.

Earlier this year, he sidled into a couple's engagement photos while on a walk in his hometown in South Carolina - sending the internet into some form of meltdown.

That came after the twice-married actor gatecrashed a bachelor party with relationship advice, and weeks later turned up at an unwitting fan's Bill Murray Ice Cream Social. 

It seems even his co-stars in St Vincent, released on October 24, have attributed legendary status to the star. 

'If you get a glimpse, the party follows him,' Naomi Watts, said at the Toronto Film Festival, which declared its second day Bill Murray Day.

'He is such a joy to work with and every day on set felt like a party.'

Murray has no agent or manager, and uses a 1-800 phone number and messaging service to field calls from producers and directors eager for his involvement in their projects.

Melfi, who also wrote the script for 'St. Vincent,' said he called the number dozens of times. Luckily for him, Murray finally called back. 

Ramp it up: Murray gave a more raucous performance on Saturday at a karaoke night in St Andrews, Scotland

Rocking it: He was accompanied by Don Felder and Bon Jovi's Tico Torres at the Alfred Dunhill party

'I try not to write with someone in mind because if you don't get them, it's just depressing,' he said. 'But Bill's the perfect blend of bitter and sweet - and heaven and hell, really. And once I started thinking of him, I couldn't stop thinking of him.' 

The film tells the story of Vincent - who drinks, gambles, and lives alone but has periodic visits with a pregnant Russian prostitute - and his unlikely friendship with the scrawny kid who moves in next door.

After a rousing audience reception at the world premiere, reviews have been mixed, with the BBC saying that the crowd 'responded on Pavlovian cue to the film's cutesy, aging-rebel theatrics, but, really, Bill Murray deserves a better movie.'

Yet Variety called the Weinstein Company movie a 'window into the actor's own soul', which it describes as 'a ticket to movie heaven.' 

The Bob Dylan performance, sung along to a cassette player, is slightly more subdued than the high-octane karaoke performance Murray gave in St Andrews last night.

Accompanied by Bon Jovi drummer Tico Torres, he treating golfers at Alfred Dunhill Links Championship to a few roaring crowd-pleasers at a post-game party - while clad in cow-print trousers.
