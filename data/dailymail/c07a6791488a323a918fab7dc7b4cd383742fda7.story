A hilarious video has emerged of a father discovering his young daughter has cut her own hair off.

In the footage, captured by the girl's father at their home in Darley Dale, in Derbyshire on Monday morning, two-year-old Tallulah holds a large bunch of blonde hair up to the camera and explains: 'I cut my fringe off because I didn't want it to be in my eyes!'

Writing about the video online, her father says: 'I came downstairs first thing in the morning to find that my two-year-old daughter Tallulah had got her first ever haircut… Unfortunately it was self-administered.'

In a final amusing twist at the end of the video, Tallulah's father accurately compares her new hairstyle to the trademark mullet sported by Yolandi Visser from South African rap group Die Antwoord.
