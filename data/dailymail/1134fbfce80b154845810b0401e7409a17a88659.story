Chelsea are on the brink of qualifying for the knockout rounds of the UEFA Youth League after a seven-goal rout of Maribor on Wednesday afternoon.

Two goals apiece for Dominic Solanke and Charlie Colkett, plus further strikes from Charly Musonda, Alex Kiwomya and Tammy Abraham, made it four group stage wins out of four for the Blues.

After a 4-1 win over Schalke in their opening game, a 5-0 thrashing of Sporting Lisbon on matchday two and a 2-0 success over the Slovenian side a fortnight ago, Adi Viveash's team knew another three points would pretty much wrap up qualification.

Accordingly, they started brightly at the Sportni Park in Lendava, taking the lead after just six minutes when Solanke, who played for Jose Mourinho's senior side against Maribor at Stamford Bridge, capitalised on a sliced kick from goalkeeper Damjan Prineg to score from close range.

Five minutes later and Chelsea doubled their lead thanks to Colkett's penalty after Ruben Loftus-Cheek was fouled in the box.

Maribor, who have yet to win in the competition, were pinned back and Musonda made it three on 25 minutes with an accurate low shot from the edge of the area.

The contest already settled, Chelsea continued to push forward at will with Prineg saving well from Solanke's chip after Colkett's ball over the home defence had set him clear.

The reprieve was short-lived as Colkett scored his second of the afternoon with a moment of individual brilliance that saw him weave his way through the shell-shocked Maribor defence.

It was five on the stroke of half-time when Loftus-Cheek scorched through the defence and crossed low for Solanke to score his second of the game and fourth of the competition.

Viveash introduced Kiwomya and Abraham for Solanke and Izzy Brown at half-time and the traffic continued to flow in one direction.

Colkett was denied his hat-trick when Prineg made a diving one-handed save after Musonda had played the Chelsea star through.

Maribor's frustrations started to surface and defender Luka Uskokovic was shown a second yellow card with 20 minutes remaining.

There was no let-up from Chelsea and they struck a sixth when Kiwomya fired high into the net following aswift move involving Abraham and Musonda.

And in stoppage time, Abraham swept home his third goal of the group phase after Colkett's free-kick was blocked.

The result puts Chelsea clear at the top of Group G with 12 points from a possible 12.
