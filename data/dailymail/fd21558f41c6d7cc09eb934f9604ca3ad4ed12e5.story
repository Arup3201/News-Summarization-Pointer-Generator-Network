Labour Cabinet ministers tried to sexually assault female politicians, Shirley Williams claimed today.

The former Education Secretary claimed that ‘more than one’ senior government figure launched assaults in the 1970s.

She said the attacks were ‘worse than groping’ but she did not speak out because of the view that politics is ‘not a soft business’.

Assault: Baroness Williams said that as a Labour minister she was pursued by older men in government in the 1970s

Baroness Williams served in Labour governments from 1974 to 1979, before later quitting the party to set up the SDP and later the Liberal Democrats.

The 82-year-old has repeatedly spoken out to defend former Lib Dem chief executive Lord Rennard, who faces a string of sex assault claims against him from party staff and activists. He strenuously denies any wrongdoing.

Baroness Williams revealed that as a female politician serving at the top of government in the 1970s she was frequently pursued by older men.

Claims: Baroness Williams defended former Lib Dem chief executive Lord Rennard against sexual harassment claims, saying he was 'a very fine man'

Allegations of the serious assaults, committed by Cabinet ministers, come at a time when police are also investigating numerous showbusiness stars over claims of sex attacks during the 1970s.

But Baroness Williams said she did not speak out at the time, because she would have been dismissed for not accepting it was part of life in Westminster at the time.

‘As a woman MP I spent a great deal of my youth being pursued by senior gentlemen,’ she told The Sun. ‘It was much worse than groping, it was assaulting.

‘If I'd said, “I've been pursued around the filing cabinets by Mr X” — and Mr X did exist and he was a Cabinet Minister — they'd have said, “For God's sake, this isn't what politics is about, it's not a soft business”.’

Asked by the newspaper to name the minister, Baroness Williams replied: ‘No. There was more than one.’

She was Prices and Consumer Protection Secretary under Harold Wilson, and later Paymaster General and Education Secretary in Harold Wilson’s government from 1976 to 1979.

She quit the Labour party in 1981,and was part of the famous Gang of Four – with Roy Jenkins, David Owen and Bill Rodgers – who set up the SDP, which later merged with the Liberal Party in 1988 to create the Liberal Democrats.

Baroness Williams again defended Lord Rennard, who was the Lib Dem chief executive from 2003 to 2009.

She said: ‘Chris has been a rock to the Liberal party, he's been an absolutely critical factor in our success.’

In February Baroness Williams came to the defence of Lord Rennard, after it emerged sexual harassment claims him had been a factor in his early retirement.

Nick Clegg promised a party inquiry and in April Scotland Yard began a criminal inquiry, interviewing up to 20 potential victims and witnesses.

But Baroness Williams, one of the most senior Lib Dem women, said the situation had been ‘hopelessly exaggerated’ and insisted Lord Rennard was ‘a very fine man’.

However, she did say that women in Parliament were ‘not treated very fairly’ and said the Commons was a ‘very bullying place, a very masculine culture’.
