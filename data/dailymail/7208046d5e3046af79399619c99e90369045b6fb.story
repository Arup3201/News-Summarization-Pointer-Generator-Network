Australians often affectionately refer to Brisbane as just a 'big country town'. 

But it was more like a ghost city on Friday morning, as the city ramped up its enormous security operation in anticipation for the arrival of major world leaders tonight and tomorrow morning.

The city's CBD was almost completely deserted as huge black riot vehicles took to the streets, steel and bulletproof glass barricades went up, helicopters constantly buzzed overhead and roaming squads of police stopped pedestrians on the street.

The always bustling Queen Street Mall, which runs through the centre of the city, was utterly desolate with many shops closed - much to the disdain of many business owners - with few shoppers daring to brave the city.

Brisbane City Council's is so worried the CBD will resemble a ghost town, with a public holiday declared on Friday to reduce traffic congestion, that residents were being urged to head into the city over the weekend.

The council's G20 chair Julian Simmonds encouraged people to visit South Bank, the botanic gardens or the city mall.

'Please don't sit at home and watch the G20 pass by on the TV,' he said.

Many residents fled the city earlier this week with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry Queensland telling Daily Mail Australia businesses had warned the government this would happen.

Not a soul could be seen down most of Elizabeth St - where Russian President Vladimir Putin will stay when he arrives tonight - except for a lone police officer on watch duty, who was casting his eye down the road from a top level of multi-storey carpark.

Some punters relished in the city's public holiday to take their pets for a walk through the CBD, taking advantage of the clean air and vacant footpaths. Brisbane residents Darren Evans and Natalie Rayment took their two dachshunds for a stroll, something they 'don't usually do', they told Daily Mail Australia.

Elsewhere in the city, around 250 people gathered to take to the streets in a march about Indigenous deaths in custody curling through the city, in what police expected would be the biggest protest today.

But while residents might have cleared out the G20 Summit is still expected to generate more than $100 million for Brisbane's economy, according to Queensland's tourism minister.

World leaders have begun arriving in Brisbane with as many as 4000 delegates and 3000 reporters from around the globe expected to attend the half a billion dollar two-day gathering.

The summit has been criticised as an expensive talkfest but Queensland's Tourism Minister Jann Stuckey says it's a rare opportunity to showcase Brisbane and Queensland to a power international audience.

'The economic benefit is estimated to be around $100 million but I believe it will far exceed that when we look at the long lasting legacy,' she told reporters at the G20 international media centre at South Bank on Thursday.

'When you have an international conference you are writing business for years to come.'

From Friday Brisbane will on Friday transform from the laid back capital of Queensland to the temporary home of some of the most powerful people in the world.

Many of the G20 leaders will jet in throughout the day, including the presidents of China, Indonesia, India and South Korea, the prime ministers of the UK, Canada and Japan, and German Chancellor Angela Merkel.

But it will be the arrival of Russian President Vladimir Putin that is bound to attract most attention.

His visit is highly contentious due to Russia's role in the downing of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 over Ukraine in July. A total of 298 people, including 38 Australian citizens and residents, were killed in the disaster.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott - who last month said he would 'shirtfront' Mr Putin on the MH17 issue - has already had one tense encounter with the Russian leader this week at the APEC summit in Beijing, and another is expected this weekend at the annual G20 summit.

Mr Putin will likely receive a hostile welcome from everyday Australians as well, with at least one anti-Putin protest planned for Saturday.

Australian Federation of Ukrainian Organisations president Stefan Romaniw has called on other G20 leaders to show their disapproval of Russia's actions by imposing sanctions on the country and stripping it of the 2018 FIFA World Cup.

'He needs to be hit hard, to be ostracised in that (G20) meeting and feel the full brunt of the international community,' he said. 

The last of the leaders arrive on Saturday, with US President Barack Obama and his huge entourage landing early in the morning. The president will deliver a speech at the University of Queensland before joining other G20 leaders.
