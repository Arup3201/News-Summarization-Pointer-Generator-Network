There has been nearly one near-miss collision a day on US runways in the past 10 years - a 66 per cent jump,  research has revealed.

Last year, 314 incidents - called 'runway incursions' were reported, involving at least one foreign or commercial flight. 

However, only six of these warranted being deemed at risk of serious crash.

Los Angeles International Airport has seen a rise in the number of 'runway incursions'

On October 22, two Delta Air Lines planes clipped wings while taxiing to depart from Minneapolis-St Paul International Airport.

On October 5, a Delta jet with 44 passengers was clipped by a Royal Jordanian Airlines Airbus A330 carrying 159 passengers at JFK Airport in New York.

In May 2013, a United Express flight and a Scandinavian Airlines Airbus A330 collided on a taxiway at Newark Liberty International Airport.

In April 2011, an Air France A380 jet taxiing to the runway at JFK Airport hit the tail of a regional jet, spinning the smaller aircraft 90 degrees.

The three airports with the most runway incursions since 2003 are also the nation's busiest: Chicago's O'Hare International, Los Angeles International Airport and Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International.

Experts say the sheer number of reported potential collisions remains a concern, despite there being no fatal crash involving a US domestic airline since 2009.

On February 12 that year, Colgan Air Flight 3407, a Bombardier Dash 8 Q400, flying from Newark Liberty International in New Jersey to Buffalo Niagara International Airport in New York crashed into a house in Clarence, New York, killing all 49 aboard the plane and one on the ground.

Mark Rosenker, former chairman of the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board, told USA Today: 'Runway incursions are always at the top of the list when it comes to aviation safety issues.'

While many of the 'incursions' pose no real threat to passengers, sometimes it is only a matter of distance that keeps planes out of danger.

A traffic jam of airplanes on the tarmac at Minneapolis-St Paul International Airport in January this year left a passenger jet unable to taxi off an active runway.

However, other aircraft continued to take off, and the nervous pilot was forced to watch on, helpless. A collision was missed by only some 80-100feet.

Chicago's O'Hare International has the highest percentage of near-miss collisions

Writing in a federal report, the pilot described the fact that no collision occurred as 'extremely lucky,' and that if heavier aircraft had been involved, the situation could have been much worse.

Last month, two aircraft 'clipped wings' at Minneapolis-St Paul International Airport that saw the flight bound for Los Angeles and Louisville delayed for hours.

Passenger Christina Theodoroff, who was travelling to visit family in Los Angeles, told USA Today: 'We were just on the runway, taxiing, and then all of the sudden, there was a big bump that we all felt.

'They wouldn't tell us right away what happened, but everyone around me knew.' 

As technology has developed over the years with regard to managing airport runways, the chances of serious collisions has fallen dramatically.

Estimates in the US are that there was an 84 per cent drop from 2000-2013 in the number of incidents that were regarded as posing a 'severe threat'.
