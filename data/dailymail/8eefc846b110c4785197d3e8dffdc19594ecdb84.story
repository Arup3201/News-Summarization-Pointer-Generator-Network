A Chinese truck driver died after he forgot to lower the back of his dumper truck and it smashed into a flyover causing it to  crash down onto his cab.

The unnamed 45-year-old was killed instantly when his truck slammed into the massive concrete flyover in Changsha city in south China's Hunan province and toppled onto him.

Police said the flyover weighed hundreds of tonnes and fell onto the driver with incredible force  during the horrific accident.

It's thought that the truck struck the flyover at full speed because the trucker had not realised that he had the rear of his truck still raised after delivering a load of earth.

Motorcyclist Hsin Hu told local media: 'I came out of a side street as the lorry went past with the back up. I turned to follow it and seconds later it hit the flyover with a crash. 

'There was a cloud of dust and then I realised that slowly the flyover was starting to topple to the side, and then it picked up speed and crashed with an enormous bang.' 

After the accident, a handful of local residents stood near the flyover  in Changsha city and looked on in disbelief at the carnage. Some even took pictures of the shocking crash on their cell phones.
