A holidaymaker died in Ibiza after falling over a cliff as she celebrated a marriage proposal from her boyfriend.

Police say she lost her balance as she jumped up and down in excitement after her partner asked for her hand in marriage.

The pair, from Bulgaria, were at a beauty spot famed for its sunset views.

Dimitrina Dimitrova, 29, suffered a heart attack brought on by injuries caused by the 65ft fall in the tiny resort of Cala Tarida on Ibiza's west coast.

She was alive but unconscious when paramedics arrived but died at the scene minutes later.

The incident happened around lunchtime on Tuesday. A local Civil Guard spokesman said: 'Everything is pointing towards the death being the result of a tragic freak accident.' 

A source added: 'Her boyfriend lived and worked on Ibiza. She had arrived two days earlier to visit him and look for work.

'She fell seconds after her partner surprised her by proposing to her as she jumped up and down with emotion.' 

It is believed the dead woman's devastated waiter boyfriend had singled out the beauty spot to make his marriage proposal.

Last August a Polish couple fell to their deaths while taking a selfie at a cliff's edge in the popular tourist spot Cabo da Roca, Portugal.

Their children, aged five and six, witnessed the accident and were taken into care before returning to their homeland to live with relatives.
