 The wife of New York Mayor Bill de Blasio has been forced to deny that she wore jeans to the funeral of a slain NYPD officer after furious cops lashed out and called her 'disrespectful.' 

Within hours of the funeral for Officer Wenjian Liu, pictures began to circulation on NYPD email chains and social media criticizing First Lady Chirlane McCray for reportedly wearing denim to the ceremony.

One internet meme showed a picture of McCray in the outfit that read: 'Nothing says disrespect like rocking jeans to a cops (sic) funeral.'

This meme began circulating after New York City First Lady Chirlane McCray was spotted wearing what looked like jeans at the funeral of Officer Wenjian Liu

The outfit was actually a 'respectful' blue-and-grey pantsuit, says City Hall and the designer who made the $600 clothing set

The criticism reached such a furor that City Hall issued a statement saying that the outfit was in fact a dark pants suit and was 'somber and appropriate.' 

Even McCray's favorite fashion designer, who sells the $600 pantsuit, has chimed in - telling the New York Daily News that she was actually wearing a dark rayon-polyester blend suit and that it wasn't denim. 

The criticism comes as tensions between City Hall and NYPD officers are at their highest in decades. Several officers turned their backs on the de Blasio when he spoke at Liu's funeral on Sunday - and dozens more turned their backs when the mayor spoke at the funeral for his partner Rafael Ramos last month. 

The head of the NYPD's largest police union has said de Blasio has 'blood on his hands' for the deaths of Ramos and Liu after they were gunned down by a madman who was upset about alleged police brutality cases.

The mayor, whose children are biracial, said in a speech that he has talked to his son about avoiding racially profiled by the NYPD. He also expressed sympathy for protesters angry about this death last summer of State Island resident Eric Garner while he was being arrested. 

Arrests and citations have plummeted across the city and there are reported of an organized slowdown in work.  

McCray, a former lesbian who is a poet and a marketing executive, wore a pantsuit by Taiwanese-American designer  Anni Kuan to the funeral. 

Kuan admitted to the Daily News that the grey-white-and-blue patterns on the suit could be mistaken for denim. 

However, she says it was appropriate attire for the funeral.

'It's a very respectful suit you would wear to an important gathering,' she told the newspaper.
