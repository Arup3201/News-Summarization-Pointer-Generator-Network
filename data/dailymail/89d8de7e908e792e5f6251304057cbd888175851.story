The mother of a two-year-old girl who
 died in agony in hospital after a series of delays said she felt 'let 
down by the system' - as a medical expert said her daughter’s death was 
'avoidable'.

Tragic toddler Alice Mason died after developing hydrocephalus - water on the brain - which caused irreversible brain damage.

An
 inquest heard that Alice’s care was blighted by a series of shocking 
delays and failures at the three London hospitals that shared her care -
 the Royal Marsden in Chelsea, Kingston and St George’s in Tooting.

Alice Mason, two, died after doctors repeatedly failed to discuss the findings of an MRI scan. She had suffered irreversible brain damage following treatment for a brain tumour

Today Alice’s mother, Rosalind Mason, said she had serious concerns about the shared care pathway her daughter was put on.

In part of her statement, read to West London Coroner’s Court, she said: 'I felt completely let down by the system.

'No child should have to experience what she suffered in the final weeks of her life.'

Taking
 to the witness stand to give evidence in person, Mrs Mason added: 'I’m 
still not convinced that shared care is a safe option for providing care
 for very sick children.

'I’m afraid our experience of even trying to find the truth about our daughter has been hugely complicated.

'We
 have found that going through the reports they have written in response
 to our questions has been very lengthy, we have not agreed with many of
 the things they have written.

'It is saddening that this situation is still in place.'

Flawed system: The two-year-old's parents Rosalind and Gareth Mason, say they have serious concerns about the shared care pathway her daughter was put on

Alice
 had undergone an operation to remove a brain tumour in January 2011 and
 had been responding well to chemotherapy, the inquest heard.

But
 her condition deteriorated and her worried parents took her to the 
Royal Marsden Hospital on March 23rd complaining that she was unsteady 
and vomiting.

She
 was discharged that night but continued being sick so her parents 
rushed her to Kingston Hospital where they told doctors that specialists
 had said Alice should have an emergency CT scan, the inquest heard.

But
 Mr and Mrs Mason claim their pleas fell on deaf ears as doctors refused
 the scan, and said the sick toddler did not 'fit their criteria'.

Mrs
 Mason said that by March 25th she was 'becoming so frustrated that the 
situation with our daughter was becoming more serious and that we 
weren’t being listened to.'

She rang doctors at the Royal Marsden and pleaded with them to speed up the process so the CT scan would be done sooner.

She added: 'It seemed to us that no action was being taken.'

By that night Alice’s condition had deteriorated and she was vomiting more.

Mrs
 Mason, who kept vigil by her daughter’s bed every night, said: 'I 
reported the vomiting to the nursing team and I took a note on my mobile
 phone because I wasn’t convinced they were keeping all the records with
 the vomiting.'

It
 was not until March 26th - some three days after Alice was first 
admitted - that the scan was ordered and by this point the brain damage 
was irreversible.

In
 a scathing indictment of the care Alice received, an expert doctor said
 that Kingston Hospital was guilty of a 'basic failure in care'.

Dr
 Stephen Rose, consultant paediatrician at Birmingham Heartlands 
Hospital, said in his report: 'It is unclear to me why a CT scan was not
 undertaken on the face of clear evidence on March 24 and 25.

'Had a CT scan been undertaken it would have shown hydrocephalus with raised intracranial pressure.'

He
 told the inquest that by 6.30pm on March 25 Alice’s vomiting had 
worsened and that the 'threshold' for a CT scan had been crossed.

He
 was asked by the family’s barrister Jeremey Hyam if the hospital’s 
failure to tell a consultant about her worsening condition amounted to 
'a basic failure'.

He replied 'I would say so.'

He added: 'There is a basic failure to respond and comply with a plan that has been set and order an urgent CT scan.'

An inquest heard staff at Kingston Hospital in south London failed to act on the advice of a specialist oncologist at the Royal Marsden Hospital in Chelsea, to give Alice a CT scan if her condition worsened

He
 said that if a CT scan had been ordered it would have diagnosed 
hydrocephalus and Alice would have been rushed to St Georges for an 
operation.

Asked by Mr Hyam if the 'death was avoidable' he said 'that is my opinion'.

He
 also criticised doctors who dismissed the concerns of Alice’s parents 
saying a doctor would be 'foolhardy to dismiss the suggestions by the 
parents that there had been a deterioration'.

He
 also raised questions about the operation of shared care systems, which
 he said were not robust and relied on phonecalls between individual 
doctors rather than shared protocals.

After
 the scan Alice was rushed to St George’s hospital where specialist 
neurological surgeons operated to ease the pressure on her brain. But 
she died just days later, on March 30th.
