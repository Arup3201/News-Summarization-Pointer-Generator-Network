Southampton midfielder Morgan Schneiderlin has responded angrily to chairman Ralph Krueger's assertion he and Jay Rodriguez will be staying at the club this summer.

Krueger made the comments amid rumours that former manager Mauricio Pochettino is interested in taking the duo to join him at Tottenham.

It was designed to appease fans' fears that the exit door at St Mary's was still open following the departure of Adam Lallana, Rickie Lambert and Dejan Lovren to Liverpool, Luke Shaw to Manchester United and Calum Chambers to Arsenal.

But Schneiderlin, 24, took to Twitter within an hour to react to Krueger's comments by saying: '6 years of an amazing journey #saintsfc DESTROYED in 1 hour !!!'

Rodriguez, who is currently sidelined with a serious knee injury will become the sixth player to leave the club this summer.

'They are part of the core that we have decided to keep at Southampton,' he told Sky Sports News.
