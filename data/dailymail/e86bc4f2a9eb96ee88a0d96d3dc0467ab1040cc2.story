‘You're Man United and your captain is Scouse’ sang the Swansea fans at Old Trafford on Saturday afternoon.

It was a fitting taunt towards the United supporters who were still revelling in Steven Gerrard’s misfortune when missing out on the title last season, some of whom will never forget that Rooney wanted to leave their club not once but twice.

Others will accept that United need Rooney now more than ever, as he proved with an acrobatic equaliser in his first game since being installed as Louis van Gaal’s captain on a permanent basis.

‘Let it fly’ has been Van Gaal’s advice to the England striker and he followed it to the letter. Going airborne to meet the ball with an overhead kick in the second half, Rooney hauled his team back into the game. It will be by no means the last time they lean heavily on him for goals this season.

Traditionally that goal would have been the point United kicked on and overran the opposition but those days now seem depressingly distant for their supporters. 

Rooney’s strike ultimately proved to be irrelevant and it will irk him that his first game as official club captain ended in defeat to Swansea City.

Van Gaal’s words of advice alluded to the England striker not allowing the added responsibility of being skipper to weigh him down and inhibit his game.

Great captains grow in stature with the armband and Van Gaal saw signs from Rooney against Valencia on Tuesday night that he was trying too hard to justify his appointment ahead of Robin van Persie.

It is difficult to know at what stage a player is trying too hard; when he stops dragging his team forward and they start dragging him down.

In the first half it certainly felt like the latter as Rooney tried to raise United from an attacking stupor.

One ambitious effort was attempted from 30 yards.

Had he caught the shot properly and hit the back of the net, Old Trafford would have been on its feet.

Pushing hard: Rooney's goal wasn't enough for United even as he tried to make up the deficit 

Instead it bobbled rather embarrassingly along the ground and only just made it through to Lukasz Fabianski.

Another shot from range was easily anticipated by Jordi Amat and a downward header from Ashley Young’s cross was directed straight at Fabianski.

There was no denying Rooney eight minutes after the interval, however, and he almost put United ahead with a clever free kick that clipped the outside of Fabianski’s left upright.

Gylfi Sigurdsson silenced Old Trafford, however, and as the United fans once again drifted away wondering where it has all gone wrong, the fact that the club’s captain is Scouse was the least of their worries.
