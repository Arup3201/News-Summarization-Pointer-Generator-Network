Violent and bloody protests have erupted around the world as furious Muslims react to Charlie Hebdo's 'survivor' edition - again featuring the holy Prophet Muhammad on its front cover.

As pictures emerged of a photographer shot in the chest during riots in Pakistan - so did the news of churches being burned down in Niger, and equally violent clashes in Jordan.

A bullet reportedly struck Adif Hasan's lung and passed through his chest, as 200 protesters took to the streets outside the French consulate in Kuratchi. 

It's believed he was shot by demonstrators, and although his condition was at first thought to be serious, he was now said to be recovering.

AFP news director Michele Leridon said that Hassan underwent surgery and that 'his life does not seem in danger'. Two other people are said to have been injured.

Pakistani authorities used tear gas, batons and water cannons to disperse angry crowds who tried to force their way into the consulate. Police were also said to have fired warning shots in the air. 

The rallies come a day after Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif led parliament in condemning the cartoons published by the magazine whose officers were attacked last week, resulting in the deaths of 12 people. 

Religious leaders had called for the magazine's journalists to be hanged and urged their followers to join the protests.

Meanwhile, the Niger government confirmed four people were killed as the police clashed with protesters who attacked a French cultural centre and set churches ablaze.

Police fired tear gas to suppress the crowds in the city of Zinder, where angry Muslims burned French flags and attacked Christian shops with clubs and Molotov cocktails. 

Three civilians died - including two who were shot by police during an attack on their station - Niger's Interior Minister, Hassoumi Massaoudou, said on state televison.

The fourth person to be killed was a police officer who was run over,  while 45 other people sustained injuries.

Mr Massaoudou said: 'Zinder experienced a quasi-insurrectional situation, a spontaneous protest of a criminal nature.

'I would like to reassure Christians that the state is here to defend those living in Niger at all costs.'

Aboubacar Mamane, a shopkeeper who witnessed the riots, says he saw crowds of mostly youths ransacking the city.

He added: 'The protesters are crying out in local Hausa language 'Charlie is Satan - let hell engulf those supporting Charlie'.'

The streets were calmer by nightfall, residents have said. As a precaution, the government forbade people to hold a Saturday sermon for the Prophet Muhammad at the main square mosque in the capital, Niamey.

Religious keaders called for the magazine's journalists to be hanged and urged their followers to join the protests, which took place across Pakistan

Back in Pakistan, The Telegraph reports that thousands of religious party activists are expected to join the protests nationwide. 

They are said to include followers of Jamaat-ud-Dawa, the charitable wing of the banned Lashkar-e-Taiba militant group which masterminded attacks on Mumbai in 2008.

The Jamat-ul-Ahrar faction of the Pakistani Taliban has issued a statement lauding the two brothers - Said and Cherif Kouachi -  who carried out the terrorist attack in Paris, saying 'they freed the earth from the existence of filthy blasphemers'.

'O enemies of Islam beware! Every youth of this Ummah (Muslim community) is willing to sacrifice himself on the honour of (the) Prophet,' said the statement, which was sent via email by spokesman Ehsanullan Ehsan.

Religious leaders had called for the magazine's journalists to be hanged and urged their followers to join the protests. 

French flags have been burnt in the northwest city of Peshawar and central Multan and rallies have also been held in the capital Islamabad and the eastern city of Lahore.

Thousands also took to the streets of Amman in Jordan protesting over the magazine

Clashes also broke out in the Jordanian capital of Amman, between security forces and about 2,000 protesters organised by the Muslim Brotherhood - the country's largest opposition group.

Riot police used batons to disperse the people as they tried to march towards the French Embassy.

The crowd chanted slogans against Charlie Hebdo and Jordanian officials for taking part in a unity march in Paris on Sunday. 

The Jordanian royal household denounced Charlie Hebdo's latest cover, saying publishing the cartoon was 'irresponsible and far from the essence of freedom of expression'. 

King Abdullah and Queen Rania, however, took part in the Paris march in solidarity with the victims of the terror attack.

Yesterday, the Royal Jordanian Hashemite Court issued a statement calling the cartoon insulting, irresponsible and reckless.
