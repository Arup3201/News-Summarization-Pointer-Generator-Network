Chelsea Clinton has her mother's ear like no other political adviser as Hillary's 'shadow campaign for a run at the presidency in 2016 was revealed today.

'Chelsea talks to Hillary about her political future more than anyone else,' a long-time Clinton insider said Monday in Washington.

That 'anyone else' presumably includes Bill Clinton, the former president.

'Everyone else is just guessing at this point, but her daughter will have more influence than all the fundraisers and political operatives put together.'

In a wide-ranging profile of the would-be Democratic candidate, Politico reported Sunday night that 'it would be hard to overstate the closeness between Hillary Clinton and her only child, who is known to have more of her mother’s signature caution and private approach, than her father’s more free-wheeling style.'

The former first daughter, now a married 33-year-old, has her famous mother's ear at a critical time in the decision-making process

Playing it coy: ' I am very strongly exercising my prerogative as a daughter to make sure my mom has this year to rest and reflect,' Chelsea Clinton said in October

That closeness, it seems now, is carrying over into her mother's political decision tree.

'Hillary
 Clinton has met with political professionals who want her to run, of 
course,' the strategist with decades-long Clinton ties told MailOnline. 
'But you can count those meetings on one hand.'

'She
 talks to her daughter several times a week, and they're not just 
chatting about the foundation, or when Bill and Hillary are getting a 
grandchild. They're talking about the family legacy, and that includes a
 2016 White House run.'

Chelsea, now 33, has become an 
articulate spokeswoman for the Clinton Global Initiative, a charitable 
project of the foundation that now bears her name alongside those of her
 parents.

As the newest family standard-bearer, she's asked often for insight into what could be a second Clinton presidency.

'Before anything else, she is my mom,' the younger Clinton said in October during Fortune magazine's 'Most Powerful Women Summit' in Washington.

'So I want her to do whatever she wants to do. … I am very strongly exercising my prerogative as a daughter to make sure my mom has this year to rest and reflect.'

She was confident, she said, that her mother would 'make the right choice.'

That choice is already a work in progress: One New Hampshire political reporter noted the presence of Clinton national adviser Craig Smith in the Granite State on Monday.

Hillary Clinton is seeking advice from several long-time advisers, including long-time insider Huma Abedin (R)

New
 Hampshire's first-in-the-nation primary election is often a predictor 
or Democratic and Republican nominations, although Clinton herself won 
that contest in 2008 and failed to close the deal.

Clinton advisers plan to visit Iowa, another bellwether primary state, later in January.

The
 portion of the campaigns-and-elections industry that's loyal to 
Democratic Party politics has been busy recruiting Hillary to run, 
according to Politico.

Veteran field operatives with the Dewey Square Group, an influential Washington, D.C. public opinion consultancy, met with the potential candidate early in the summer of 2013.

'It appears to have been the only formal 2016-related presentation Clinton has been given from anyone outside her immediate circle,' Politico reported.

But competing outside organizations are building a shadow campaign, partially without Clinton's input or permission. It includes a national 'Ready For Hillary' effort, which splashed a bumper-sticker campaign on Sunday with help from retired Army General Wesley Clark.

'One of the best ways to spark these conversations about Hillary potentially running in 2016 is by showing your support right now,' Clark wrote in an email to Clinton's supporters.

Clinton's campaign organization, which lost the Democratic nomination to Barack Obama in 2008, rented its list to Ready For Hillary.

Priorities USA, a pro-Obama super PAC, is another organization that is grooming itself to launch a more formal Clinton campaign the moment the formal Secretary of State gives the nod.

That move won't likely come until after the 2014 midterm congressional election in November.

The Clinton Foundation didn't respond to a request for a comment from Chelsea Clinton.
