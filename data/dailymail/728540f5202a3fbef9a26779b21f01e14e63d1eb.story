Goalkeeper Hope Solo has been reinstated by U.S. Soccer after a 30-day suspension and is on the travel roster for next month's Algarve Cup in Portugal.

Solo was suspended last month by the U.S. Soccer Federation after her husband, former Seattle Seahawks tight end Jerramy Stevens, was arrested in Southern California on suspicion of driving under the influence in a U.S. team van. 

Solo, in training camp at the time, was with Stevens when he was pulled over.

U.S. women's national team coach Jill Ellis announced Solo's inclusion on the Algarve Cup 25-player travel roster on Saturday.

Ellis will name a 23-player tournament roster before the competition, which starts on March 4. 

The United States, playing in its 20th Algarve Cup, opens with Norway. 

U.S. Soccer has not specified the reason for suspending Solo in the fitrst place, however TMZ understands it was connected to the fact that Stevens was driving a team van.  

The goalkeeper was reportedly almost arrested for disorderly conduct after she became 'belligerent' while officers conducted the traffic stop. 

She was in Southern California for training camp with the U.S. national team, which is preparing to play in the World Cup starting in June.

Solo has posted inspirational messages from fans on social media during her absence, and cheered on the national team in exhibition games in Europe. 

The United States fell 2-0 against France before beating England 1-0 with goalkeeper Ashlyn Harris starting in both games.

Solo's suspension came at a critical time for the U.S. team, which is preparing for the Women's World Cup this summer in Canada.

'The situation warranted a consequence, and we thought it was reasonable,' Ellis said about Solo before the team traveled to Europe. 

'This is important for us to be able to focus the players that we have on these games and then allow Hope some time to sort of reflect on some things.'

The goalkeeper was dismissed in January from training camp in Southern California, where the team is preparing to play in the World Cup starting in June

It was the latest off-field trouble for the 33-year-old Olympian, considered one of the best goalkeepers in the women's game. 

Earlier this year, a judge dismissed two misdemeanor counts of domestic violence against her. 

Jerramy Stevens, a former Seattle Seahawks tight end, was arrested for suspicion of driving under the influence in Manhattan Beach, California

The charges stemmed from an altercation with her half-sister and 17-year-old nephew at a party in Washington state last June. 

Solo had pleaded not guilty in that case and she continued to play for the U.S. team and with her National Women's Soccer League team, the Seattle Reign, while awaiting trial.

Her last appearance in a match with the national team was in December, when she started in a scoreless draw against Brazil in the championship game of the 2014 International Tournament of Brasilia.

In a statement released following her suspension, Solo said: 'I think it's best for me to take a break, decompress from the stress of the last several months, and come back mentally and physically ready to positively contribute to the team.'

A representative for Solo did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Saturday.

The Algarve roster also includes Christine Rampone (back), Megan Rapinoe (right knee), who were injured during the team's January training camp in Carson, California, and did not play the two matches in Europe. 

Newly married forward Sydney Leroux, who had been nursing a sore ankle, was also included.

The U.S. women, currently ranked No. 2 in the world behind Germany, are seeking their third World Cup title, but first since 1991.
