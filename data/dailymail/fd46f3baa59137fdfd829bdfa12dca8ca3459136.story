The Army has warned U.S. military personnel that ISIS supporters have been instructed to search social media for their relatives' addresses to 'show up and slaughter them', according to reports.

Officials sent out the warning by an intelligence bulletin after the Army Threat Integration Center, which issues early warnings of threats, recognized the potential danger, Fox News reported.

The bulletin warns military personnel and their loved ones about ISIS calling supporters to target their homes and suggested they take precautions.

'Given the continued rhetoric being issued by ISIL's media services and supporters through various social media platforms the ARTIC is concerned of the possibility of an attack, it says.

Warnings: The U.S. Army has warned military personnel that ISIS could target their families. It comes after U.S. aircraft, such as these F-15E Strike Eagles patrolling over Iraq,  look for ISIS strongholds

'Soldiers, Government Civilians and Family Members are reminded to be vigilant of their surroundings and report suspicious activities to their respective military or local law enforcement.'

It also describes a jihadist tweet instructing supporters to use the 'yellow pages' and social media to identify the addresses of military families, Fox reported.

ARTIC explains that the intelligence community has not found 'any corroborative or definitive extremists plots' against U.S. military members, civilians, and their families but that staff still need to be vigilant.  

'It provides renewed emphasis on force protection measures to ensure the safety and security of our DOD components, defense critical infrastructure, personnel and communities,' it said in a statement. 

Militants: ISIS terrorists control vast swaths of territory in northern Syria and western Iraq

Attack: The U.S. military released footage of four deadly air strikes, including that pictured, carried out on ISIS

ISIS, which has shared grisly videos showing the beheadings of American journalists and a British aid worker, has threatened violence against the U.S. following air strikes in Iraq in August and in Syria in September.

Supporters have been turning to Twitter to threaten the U.S. and U.S. interests with violence in response.

The warning to the U.S. Amy comes after House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers warned that the group is using social media as a 'recruiting tool'.

He said some estimates show the terror network is recruiting as many as 3,400 people per month because of their social media recruiting efforts.

On Wednesday, Pentagon officials revealed they were finding it difficult determining how effective the airstrikes against ISIS have been because of 'significant gaps in intelligence'.
