A mother has claimed her toddler discovered a nine-inch meat cleaver stuffed into the side of a bed in the family's hotel room.

Pregnant Donna Lever, her boyfriend David Johnson and their four children, aged between seven months and seven, were sent to stay at the Hill View Hotel in Blackburn, Lancashire, after a fire  devastated their home.

But when the family went to move a single bed in the hotel room, they say their two-year-old son Charles found the blade and a number of tin cans had been pushed inside a rip in the side of the piece of furniture.

The family say they reported their find to a member of hotel staff, and to Rossendale Council, which had placed them in the hotel.

But the hotel manager, EJ Hussain, refutes the claims - and has accused the family of damaging a bed, which they deny.

Miss Lever, 38, and her family were moved into the temporary accommodation after the fire, thought to have been sparked by a faulty tumble dryer, tore through their  housing association property in Bacup.

The family said they had been out when the fire started on Wednesday last week, and because their home was so badly damaged they were told by Rossendale Council that they must go into temporary accommodation at the hotel.

Miss Lever and Mr Johnson, 32, who are both jobless, and the children - Mylo, seven, Charles, two, Dominic, one, and Eva, seven months - had been due to stay at the hotel for two nights, but say they left after just one having discovered the cleaver, and returned home. 

'I couldn’t believe it,' said Miss Lever, who is 18 weeks pregnant.

'From the outside, the hotel looked presentable but the accommodation clearly hadn’t been cleaned before we arrived.

'There was a rip to the bed and a load of tin cans stuffed inside. It was bad but I never expected to find a meat cleaver. It’s a weapon.

'We were moving a single bed against a wall so the kids, who were topping and tailing, wouldn’t fall out in their sleep, and they spotted it.

'I was disgusted. We were meant to stay for two nights but we told them the next morning we were leaving. On the way out, I told a lady working there about the the cleaver.

'Now we’re back in the smoke-damaged house, despite the fact the fire service told us it wasn’t safe for me to be there while I’m pregnant.

Mr Johnson, who took a photograph of the cleaver on his mobile phone, said he believes it was left by a previous guest. 

Speaking of the moment his son found the knife he said: 'He had his hand underneath the bed and he pulled something shiny out.

'I picked it up and realised it was a massive meat cleaver.

'I was absolutely horrified. If I hadn't have seen him with it he could have done himself some serious harm.' 

The couple and their children are now sleeping on the kitchen and living room floors of their damaged house. 

Rossendale Council has confirmed it had received the complaint following the family’s stay.

But Mr Hussain says the room had been 'inspected thoroughly' before the family arrived and no concerns were reported to him during their time at the hotel. 

He later contacted the police to claim a bed had been damaged by the family, and has also accused them of littering the room with cans - which, like the criminal damage allegation, they strongly deny.

'We're a family, we don't go into a hotel and drink beer in front of our kids,' said Mr Johnson.

'I like a beer but not in front of my children. We can't even afford to drink now that our house has been damaged.

Miss Lever, 38, and her family were moved into the temporary accommodation after the fire, thought to have been sparked by a faulty tumble dryer, tore through their rented house in Bacup

'I find it insulting as all I'm trying to do is put a roof over my kids' heads.'

Mr Hussain also refutes the family's claim that the room was untidy and said the cleaver was not spotted during his staff’s prior checks.

'I have had a word with my cleaners and they say no one complained that day,' Mr Hussain said. 'I find it quite upsetting and alarming that they would make these claims.

'I have helped out vulnerable people for Rossendale Council many times. I am shocked that they would complain. I spent £90,000 on a refurbishment recently. I do not know anything about a cleaver or knife. It was not there when my staff looked.'

Lancashire police said it received a report of criminal damage at the hotel on Friday afternoon, and that officers had arranged to visit the premises.

A Rossendale Council spokesman said: 'The council’s supported accommodation providers were full on the day that the emergency occurred and our Housing Options Team were looking for accommodation for this family.

'Rossendale Council has been using this particular accommodation provider for over six years now and has never previously had a formal complaint about its condition or standards.

'The council was only made aware of the meat cleaver find once the family had left the accommodation, after one night and returned to their home. Our Housing Options Team are looking into this matter as the safety and comfort of tenants who are unfortunate to have to be placed in emergency accommodation are of paramount importance.'

Registered social landlord, Green Vale Homes, said contractors were working to repair damage to floors, ceilings and walls to the couple’s home.
