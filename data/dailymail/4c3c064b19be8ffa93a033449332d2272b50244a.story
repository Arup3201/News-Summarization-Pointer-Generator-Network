The text message sent to 120 miners 

A mine operator has been forced to apologise to about 120 workers who they sacked by text message.

The contractors were employed by Thiess mainly as drivers and machinery operators at Peabody's Burton coking coal mine in central Queensland, located between Mackay and Moranbah.

Thiess sent out the text messages last week telling them their positions had been terminated.

Workers and union reps have slammed the action as 'disgusting'.

The sacked workers used Thiess's Facebook page to vent their frustration and disappointment.

'What a bunch of dogs, sacking people by text How safe do you reckon these people felt driving home. Good work guys,' Bob Down wrote.

David Ferguson said he was disgusted at the lack of respect the company had shown by sacking people by SMS.

'An employee, a human being, deserves far more respect when letting them know such a significant decision. Shame, Thiess, shame,' he said.

'Sacking people by SMS or automated message at best reeks of callousness and at worst of cowardice.'

Thiess said workers had been told the mine would be scaled down in early August and that phone calls and SMS would be used to communicate developments.

'However, the use of SMS in this instance was an error and we apologise,' the company said in a statement on Tuesday.

The mine is located between about 150km insland  south west of Mackay

'Other affected personnel were notified in person.' 

The Construction Forestry Mining Energy Union of Queensland has accused Thiess of treating its workers like "sausages on the shelf at the butchers".

'It is just disgusting, we haven't seen this sort of nonsense since the darkest days of the Howard era," CFMEU district vice president Steve Pierce said.

Mr Pierce said some of the members who received the text - which included information about when their jobs would wind up - were already aware they were out of work.

But others were not, he said.
