Anger: Robert Halfon said Mr Flynn's comments were an 'outrageous attack', but said he is not anti-Semitic

Conservative MP Robert Halfon commented that the remark by Mr Flynn, who he worked with on the Public Administration Select Committee, was an 'outrageous attack'.

But Mr Halfon, who is Jewish, said Mr Flynn was not anti-Semitic.

Mr Flynn later apologised for his remarks saying he regretted the 'clumsily expressed remarks of mine that have caused anger and upset'.

Speaking to the Jewish Chronicle, the MP said he thought Mr Halfon's criticism was fair and that he wanted to withdraw them.

He told the newspaper: 'I greatly regret the interpretation that has been placed on them and I fully understand why offence was given.

'Some of the interpretations of these words were exaggerated suggesting malign intent that was never present or intended. Inference was built on inference.

Mr Flynn added: 'I have been an elected representative for the past 40 years and I do not have an atom of racism or anti-Semitism in me.

'If there was someone would have noticed by now.'
