Slam dunk: The 17-year-old has spent years perfecting his unbelievable repertoire of basketball trick shots in his back garden at home in Cleveland, Ohio

Kevin's has shown off his skills online, including difficult long distance shots, making tricky shots from a back or front flip and hitting the target from a trampoline.

High school student Kevin said: 'I started developing my acrobatic skills by teaching myself a variety of flips and moves on the trampoline.

'Then once I had mastered that trick, I'd do them on the ground.

'After doing thousands of flips, it was quite easy to start incorporating basketball shots into them.

'My first video got hundreds of thousands of views, so I decided to make more videos of other shots just like it.'

Kevin has uploaded the impressive trick shot videos to his KDP Productions Youtube page and Vine account where he has started to build a growing fan base.

He added: 'I often get asked how long 
it takes to make the shots. On average each video of a flip trick shot 
takes a couple of days to make.

'First I have to come up with the idea, then make sure it is actually possible to do.

'Then
 I have to practice the flip enough so that I actually feel comfortable 
doing it with a ball in my hands or feet and feel confident enough to 
make the shot.

'Then we have
 to film it which can take anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours 
depending on how the shot goes. On average around an hour in a half to 
make the trickiest shots.'
