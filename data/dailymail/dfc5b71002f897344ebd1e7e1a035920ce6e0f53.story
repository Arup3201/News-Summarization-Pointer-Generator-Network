No propaganda needed - North Korea are racking up the Olympic medals at the London Games and currently sitting in a commendable fifth place on the leader board.

The country currently has four medals - two golds in men's weightlifting, one in women's judo and a bronze in women's weightlifting.

However there is likely to be some upset for the Democratic People's Republic of Korea - as currently in fourth place is South Korea.

Currently at the top of the Olympics medal table is China, followed by the U.S. and then France.

Some of the medal winners have heaped praise on Supreme Leader Kim Jong-Un for their success.

Kim Un Guk, who set an Olympic record and took gold in the 62kg weightlifting, said: 'I won first place because the shining supreme commander Kim Jong-Un gave me power and courage.'

North Korea's state media has gone into overdrive over the nation's unexpected success, publishing a glut of stories on the Central News Agency.

One report from Pyongyang said: 'Some evil-minded foreign media asserted that the DPRK would 
take only one silver medal but our sportspersons refuted such assertions
with good results.

One dampener to the triumph came today however after the U.S. women's soccer team beat North Korea 1-0.

Embracing
the Olympic spirit and leaving aside political differences, both teams 
played ping-pong together at their hotel ahead of the match.

U.S.
player Shannon Boxx said: 'We were in the same hotel as them and the 
girls were great... We played ping-pong and stuff like that.'

The Americans won the match thanks to a 25th-minute goal from striker Abby Wambach.

After the game Wambach also commented on the political tension between the two countries, saying: 'The beautiful part about what we're doing and it being the Olympics is we don't have to worry about that.

'This is where we can put our differences aside, go out on the pitch and play for glory and that's what we're here for.'

The North Koreans' feelings were harder to gauge.

The players left the stadium without talking to journalists and coach Sin Ui Gun responded cautiously to questions, speaking through an interpreter.

Sin said: 'We are all thinking that against USA we shouldn't lose, we should win.'

Pressed by a reporter on whether it was more disappointing to lose against the United States than against other teams, the coach nodded gravely but said nothing.

Last week, the North Korea women's soccer team walked off the pitch before a match because giant screens accidentally displayed the flag of South Korea. However today's match got off to a smooth start.

Domination: United States' Abby Wambach scores against North Korea during the match on Tuesday

The north of England was the scene of North Korea's greatest sporting triumph abroad, during the 1966 World Cup, when the men's soccer team knocked out favorites Italy in one of the greatest upsets ever.

But history was not repeated on Tuesday as the American team, the defending Olympic champions, dominated.

North Korean athletes have won a total of 47 Olympic medals since the country began appearing at the Games in 1964. In Beijing in 2008, the country's total haul was six medals - two gold, one silver and three bronze.

North Korea's women footballers walked off in protest before their match with Colombia last week when the flag of bitter rivals South Korea was mistakenly shown on the big screen in Scotland's Hampden Park.

The North Koreans were only persuaded to play the match an hour later once the foul-up had been rectified.

North Korea went on to win the warm-up match 2-0, but coach Gun Sin Ui stressed the gravity of the incident and said he planned to take up the matter with Games organisers Locog and FIFA.

Mr Ui said: 'The national flag difference is a big problem. Our team was not going to participate unless the problem was solved properly.

'Unfortunately it took some time later for the broadcast to be done again properly and we made the decision to go on with the match.'

North and South Korea are neighbours but have a far from harmonious relationship.

The countries were formally established 
as separate entities in 1948, and the Korean War began in 1950. The 
animosity continues today and the two countries share the world's most 
heavily fortified border.

Hampden Park organisers had no input in the video, which introduced North Korea's side by showing a South Korean player and flag, according to BBC Scotland.

It has since emerged that the blunder has been blamed on an Olympic official who sent the big screen video package introducing players from London to Hampden.

Locog has refused to name the person responsible, but the official in question has since offered their resignation, according to the Telegraph.

Games organisers have issued an apology over the incident, while Prime Minster David Cameron said was an 'honest mistake'.
