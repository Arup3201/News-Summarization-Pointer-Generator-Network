Golden girl: Former athlete Donna Hartley-Wass died suddenly while sunbathing at her home

Former Olympic 400m bronze medalist Donna Hartley-Wass has been pronounced dead after sunbathing in her home.

The 58-year-old was found lying on a sun lounger by her husband, comedian and actor Bobby Knutt.

Hartley-Wass had been taking prescribed medication for an irregular heart rhythm and high blood pressure.

Although a pathologist said as an elite athlete her heart had been 'worked harder than most' he could not ascertain the cause of her death.

Knutt said in a statement she had been to work as a fitness instructor at a 
local gym, then saw a physiotherapist for back pain before she began 
relaxing with a glass of wine.

He
 said: 'We went into the garden to enjoy the sunshine and she was just 
wearing bikini bottoms. She went on the sun lounger to do her back face 
down.

'I
 went inside to watch a DVD then came back out to talk to her but she 
appeared to be sleepy so I thought better of it and left her.

'I went back in to watch some more DVDs then went outside again to see if she wanted some suntan lotion rubbing on her back.

'She
 was still in the same position face down with her head resting on her 
arms but her face had turned purple and she looked like she had died.'

He phoned for an ambulance to their home at Elsecar, near Barnsley but she could not be resuscitated.

He
 went on: 'She was fit and did not take drugs and would only have a 
couple of glasses of wine. I’m shocked. It was completely unexpected.'

Mrs Hartley-Wass's distinctive shoulder-length blonde hair and speed on the track earned her the nickname 'golden girl' in the late 1970s.

Pathologist
 Dr Charles Wilson said Hartley-Wass had been suffering from hypertension and 
an abnormal heart rhythm for which she was taking tablets to lower her 
blood pressure and prevent complications.

birthday.

But her heart, lungs and liver were completely normal and there was no blockage of the coronary arteries.

He
 did find a 'striking' build up of iron in her liver which he said was 
almost always genetic yet does not often cause sudden death.

Hartley-Wass married fellow athlete Bill 
Hartley in 1977, but the relationship ended in divorce. She met TV actor
 Bobby Knutt in 1984 and they married three years later.

Donna took her husband’s real surname Wass and moved to live in his native Sheffield.

After retiring from athletics she became a champion body builder and won the ‘Miss Britain Physique’ title.

On-and-off the track accomplishments: Hartley-Wass won a bronze medal in 
the 4x400m relay at the 1980 Moscow Olympics for Great Britain (left) and she was awarded an MBE 
in 1979 (right).

She later ran a line dancing school in the city and had been working as a hotel leisure club manager when she died.

A
 self-confessed sun worshipper, she returned home early from work on 
Friday to soak up the rays in her garden and make the most of the fine 
June weather.

Mr Knutt, 67,
 said they went outside together at about 3pm and he returned inside to 
watch television about half-an-hour later. When he went back out some 
time later to speak to his wife she was dead.

‘I
 went out to see her and she had gone. I don’t know what happened, she 
might have had a heart attack.’ The couple have no children but Mr Knutt
 has a daughter from a previous marriage.

'She had none of the common features of liver failure,' he added.

However he did discover a pigment in her heart which is normally only seen in elderly people.

Donna Hartley-Wass was born in Southampton in 1955 and came to early prominence in the athletics world when she became a south of England sprint champion while still a teenager.The talented runner originally became well known under her maiden name Murray and her distinctive looks made her an instantly recognisable figure.She and won the AAA's 200 metres in 1972 then the 400 metres in 1975 but it was the 400 metres in which she excelled.In 1977 she became UK 400 metres champion and also became one half of a UK athletics golden couple she married fellow athlete and European 400 metres champion Bill Hartley. The marriage later ended in divorce.In 1978, Hartley won two Commonwealth gold medals in Edmonton, Canada, in the 400 metres and the 4x400m relay.In 1979 she was European cup semi finalist winner in both the 400 metres and 400m relay again and crowned a stellar year with a visit to the palace to pick up her MBE.The highlight of her career came in 1980 when she won a bronze medal at the Moscow Olympic Games in the 4x400m relay.After retiring from athletics with an achilles heel problem, she married actor and comedian Robert Wass, better known as Bobby Knutt, and became a champion body builder winning the Miss Britain Physique title in 1988.

'Because
 she was an athlete her heart would have done an awful lot more work 
than the average person’s heart,' said the pathologist.

'I
 don’t know whether this caused heart failure. I couldn’t see anything 
which suggests that to be the cause. We have a previously healthy lady 
who has died suddenly.'

Dr Wilson said it was possible the electrical activity of the heart was interrupted causing an irregular heart beat which led to death or there were several natural possible causes.

He had carried out a full review and toxicological tests but concluded it was unascertained. 'I don’t know the underlying precise pathological cause of her death,' he said.

'Her heart was worked much harder than the average person but I don’t think it is sufficient to give a cause of death,' he said.

He told assistant Sheffield coroner Louise Slater that he was satisfied Donna died from natural causes. 'It fits the category of natural disease which we can’t detect with current medical science,' he said.

Det Sgt Stuart Hall said police were called in to investigate the death after blisters were found on Donna’s back but it turned out to be nothing untoward as she had been lying in the sun.

In his statement Mr Knutt said: 'She did all her training clean. She had strong moral compass and was immediately successful in her body-building career.'

He went on: 'It was completely unexpected because she was fine earlier in the day.'

Recording a conclusion of death from natural causes, the coroner said: 'It was a completely natural event however unexpected. Science cannot prove what happened at that time.

'These are very unusual circumstances. I know what a terrific athlete and body-builder she was.'

After the hearing Mr Knutt said: 'It was the biggest shock of my life. She was as fit as a butcher’s dog and only looked about 42. She used to worry about everything but that is how she was.'
