Even after admitting to killing her ex-boyfriend in 2008, Jodi Arias continues to insist that she is innocent of the horrific crime.

The 32-year-old California woman who could be facing the death penalty if convicted in the murder of 30-year-old Travis Alexander sat down for a jailhouse interview with CBS’ 48 Hours.

While the prosecution claims that Arias stabbed Alexander 27 times, shot him in the face and slashed his throat from ear to ear in a fit of jealous rage following a sexual encounter in his Arizona home, the woman continues to maintain her innocence.

Defiant: Jodi Arias insisted in a new CBS interview that if found guilty of her boyfriend's murder, she would not be the first person wrongly convicted

Sentencing: Arias said that she would prefer to get the death penatly rather than spend the rest of her life in prison

‘If a conviction happens, I know I won’t be the first person to be wrongly convicted,’ she told a CBS reporter recently,' adding that she knows in her heart that in the system of ‘God’s justice,’ she is ‘OK.’

Thinking about the outcome of her trial, the soft-spoken brunette appeared resigned to her fate.

‘If it was my choice, I would choose the death penalty because I don’t want to spend a life in prison,’ she said.

During a 2008 interview recorded for 48 Hours, Arias said that she would have gained nothing from the gristly slaying.

Bogus tale: At the time, Arias said that she and Alexander were attacked by a pair of men who assaulted her lover with a knife and gun

'I’ve been sitting a lot in my cell thinking, "What a waste," you know? I did have my whole future ahead of me,' Arias told a reporter five years ago. 'I had everything to lose and nothing to gain if I killed Travis. I loved him and still love him.'

More than four years later, the woman has
revised her story, telling reporter Maureen Maher that she killed 
Alexander, but did so in self-defense.

Arias is accused of stabbing the Mormon real estate agent and motivational speaker 27 times, shooting him in the face and slitting his throat from ear to ear in the shower of his apartment after the two had a sexual encounter.

In mid-August 2008, two months after the gruesome slaying that had shaken the Mesa community, Arias sat down with Maher for a jailhouse interview that eventually made it into the 48 Hours segment called Picture Perfect - The Trial of Jodi Arias.

In the course of the lengthy talk, the media-savvy suspect offered her fabricated version of events, claiming that after she and Alexander had had sex, two men dressed in black broke into his home and attacked the 30-year-old with a knife and a gun. 

On trial: Jodi Arias is charged with murder in the June 2008 death of her on-again-off-again boyfriend Travis Alexander

Heavy penalty: If convicted, Arias could get the death penalty, becoming just the fourth woman on Arizona's death row

Her lover was stabbed on the floor, 
but Arias said she managed to escape. She added that she never told 
anyone about the deadly attack because she was afraid, but she was 
certain at the time that Alexander was alive. 

'It
was the scariest experience of my life,' she said of the bogus home 
invasion. 'It was just so unreal. It was like a move unfolding. Like a 
horrible movie.'

Police have
since exposed Arias' tale as a boldfaced lie, and even her defense 
attorneys now say that their client was not telling the truth in the wake 
of the murder.

Arias 
eventually changed her story, telling investigators that she killed 
Alexander in self-defense, describing him as a sexually promiscuous, 
brutal man who beat her and sought to control her.

But there is no record of Arias reporting the abuse, and Alexander's friends and other former paramours said that he was never violet.

Arias herself said just months after her arrest that while her ex-boyfriend lost his temper a few times, she never felt like her life was in danger.

On Thursday, jurors in the Arias 
trial were shown graphic photos of the defendant and her slain paramour 
taken on the day of his murder.

In some of the pictures, Alexander appears alive in the shower, while other images captured his dead body on the floor. 

The day before, a videotaped 
interrogation of the 32-year-old was played in court. A detective 
grilled Arias, explaining that all the evidence points to her. She 
insisted she did not kill him.

Mesa police detective Esteban Flores continued to press her on the tape.

Femme fatale: Prosecutors say Arias drove to Alexander's home armed with a gun and knife with the intent to kill him

Conflicting words: Jurors in the trial watched a videotaped interrogation of Arias Wednesday during which she insists she didn't kill Travis Alexander, right, but says if she had, she would have killed him quickly and humanely

‘You shot him in the head, then you got a knife and you stabbed him,’ Flores said. ‘Jodi, tell me the truth, please.’

‘I did not kill Travis,’ Arias 
replied. However, she said if she were to have killed him, she couldn't 
have stabbed him. It would have been too cruel.

‘I don't think I could stab him. I 
think I would have to shoot him until he was dead if that were my 
intentions,’ Arias told the detective. ‘But I would have to wear gloves.

‘If I had it in me to kill him, the least I could have done was make it as humane as possible,’ she added.

If found guilty of murder, Arias would become just the fourth woman on Arizona's death row.

She allegedly stabbed and slashed 
Alexander nearly 30 times, slitting his throat from ear to ear, and shot
him in the head around June 4, 2008, at his Mesa home. His body was 
found five days later in his shower by roommates.

Crime scene: Photographs shown in the murder trial of Jodi Arias show the crime scene at Travis Alexander's home in Mesa, California after his body was found

Bloodied: Investigators described the 2008 crime scene as among the most gruesome they'd ever seen

Prosecutors say Arias drove from California armed with a gun and a knife with the intent to kill the 30-year-old devout Mormon. She neglected to call police after leaving behind a crime scene
that investigators described as among the most gruesome they'd ever 
seen.

They say she attacked him in a 
jealous rage after he broke up with her. She says she broke up with him 
after about five months of dating, but the two continued to see each 
other sexually.

Arias' attorney, Jennifer Willmott, 
told jurors in opening statements that Alexander ‘lunged at Jodi in 
anger’ on the day he was killed after becoming upset that she dropped his new camera in the shower, and she had no other choice but to defend herself.

She then fled the scene and drove to relatives' home in California. When Detective Flores tracked her down and questioned her about the crime, the woman denied being in Alexander's home on the day of the murder and said that she had not seen him since April 2008.

Detective Flores tracked Jodi down to her relatives' home in California to interview her about Alexander’s murder. But the woman denied being at the scene of the crime for fear of implicating herself. 

'Self-defense': Arias' attorney, Jennifer Willmott, told jurors in opening statements that Alexander 'lunged at Jodi in anger' on the day he was killed, and she had to defend herself

She told Flores that the last time she saw Alexander was in April, which obviously was not true However, evidence recovered from inside the victim’s blood-spattered home told a different tale. Police recovered a camera in Alexander’s washing machine with the photos erased.

Computer forensic unit managed to recover data, revealing dozens of pictures showing Arias and Alexander having sex and several out-of-focus, dark images depicting Alexander being killed and his dead body.

According to investigators, Alexander’s bathroom was replete with biological evidence linking Arias to the crime scene, including her hair and a bloody palm print that eventually led to her arrest.

Detective Flores revealed during the 48 Hours interview that Arias appeared conscious of her image, and even asked if she could apply makeup before being taken into custody.

‘It was like an out-of-body experience,’ Arias described her arrest to the CBS reporter. 

When the trial resumes January 29, 
both the prosecution and the defense plan on playing parts from the 48 
Hours interview for the jurors. The trial is expected to last through April.
