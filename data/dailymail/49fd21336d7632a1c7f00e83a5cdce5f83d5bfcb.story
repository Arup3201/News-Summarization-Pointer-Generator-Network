Jazz Carlin and Fran Halsall both claimed their second gold medals at the European Championships as Great Britain wrapped up their most successful-ever campaign in Berlin on Sunday.

Carlin added the 400 metres freestyle crown - with a new personal best and Welsh record time of four minutes and 3.24 seconds - to her victory in the 800m version.

Halsall took gold in the 50m freestyle, having already triumphed in the 50m backstroke.

And there was another first place for GB as Chris Walker-Hebborn, Adam Peaty, Adam Barrett and Ben Proud put in an impressive team display to win the men's 4x100m medley relay.

Roberto Pavoni secured his second medal of the competition with silver in the 400m individual medley, and a further GB medal came when Georgia Davies, Sophie Taylor, Jemma Lowe and Halsall took bronze in the women's 4x100m medley relay.

It meant the team ended the European Championships with nine golds and 24 medals in total, topping the table.
