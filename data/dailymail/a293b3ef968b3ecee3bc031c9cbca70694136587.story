Arsenal scout Gilles Grimandi has been watching Monaco left back Layvin Kurzawa.

The 22-year-old defender has been linked strongly with Manchester City although staff at the Etihad believe Bayern Munich are also keen. 

Kurzawa, who made his international debut for France last month, is rated at around £15million.

Meanwhile, Arsenal are poised to pip Manchester United to the signature of Exeter City teenager Ethan Ampadu. 

The 14-year-old academy player was called up to the Wales U16 squad for their friendlies against France in September and came off the bench in their 1-0 Victory Shield win over England last week.

Ampadu is favourite to join Arsenal as his father, Kwame, a former Arsenal and Swansea midfielder, is coaching at Arsenal's Hale End academy.
