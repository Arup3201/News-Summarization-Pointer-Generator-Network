A therapist whose clients include girls from high-society families is understood to have been arrested on suspicion of fraud.

Anne Carmel Craig, 63, who describes herself as ‘a personal development coach’, is believed to have been arrested last Monday at the home in Battersea, South-West London, she shares with her husband Rodney, a retired commander in the Royal Navy and chief executive officer of London’s prestigious University Women’s Club, a female members’ club in London’s Mayfair.

It is understood that she has been bailed on the condition that she does not contact any of her previous or existing clients.

Ms Craig keeps a low profile but her husband, Rodney, runs female members' club University Women's Club in Mayfair, London

While Ms Craig maintains a low profile – she does not even have a website – her husband enjoys a leading social position.

On the University Women’s Club website, Belfast-born Mr Craig, 64, claims to have been educated at Gordonstoun.

Ms Craig made no comment when contacted yesterday. 

The families of the girls involved, meanwhile, are lobbying for tighter regulation of therapists.
