Firefighters working on Southern California wildfires have found a badly burned body in a transient camp.

The
 city of Carlsbad said the body was found Thursday while firefighters 
were checking hotspots on a fire that began a day earlier. The city says
 it had no information about person who died.

It
 appears to be the first fatality in fires throughout the San Diego 
region that have destroyed eight homes, an 18-unit apartment complex and
 two businesses.

The San Diego County sheriff says arson will be among the many possibilities investigators will look at in trying to determine what caused nine fires to break out during a two-day heat wave

The body was found shortly 
before all evacuation orders were lifted in Carlsbad, a city of 110,000 
people 30 miles north of San Diego.

The
 San Diego County sheriff says arson will be among the many 
possibilities investigators will look at in trying to determine what 
caused nine fires to break out during a two-day heat wave.

Sheriff
 Bill Gore said Thursday that it could take months to find the causes of
 the blazes concentrated in the northwestern area of the county, from 
the coast to areas 10 to 15 miles inland.

The first fire started Tuesday. The eight other wildfires erupted over the course of hours Wednesday.

Gore says investigators are not ruling anything out, but he also wouldn't prejudge the investigations.

He noted that sparks from vehicles can easily ignite brush in such hot, dry and windy conditions.

The fires have caused more than $22 million in damage so far.

Authorities announced they have a suspect in custody but have not yet identified them

As calmer winds 
allowed firefighters to make progress on nine fires burning in San Diego
 County, one of the most serious blazes suddenly roared Thursday 
afternoon burning close to homes, triggering thousands of new evacuation
 orders and keeping the situation tenuous.

Growing
 flames raced along scrubby hillsides near the city of San Marcos as 
massive black plumes filled the afternoon skies after a half-day lull in
 winds that had allowed firefighters to gain ground against flames that 
have scorched thousands of acres this week.

Ash
 laden smoke limited visibility to a few feet at times in the inland 
suburban community. On one semi-rural street, five horses wandered 
nervously in a paddock as firefighters worked to protect nearby homes 
and barns.

Sheriff Bill Gore said the flare-up
 prompted more than 13,000 new evacuation notices in the San Marcos area
 and served as a 'reminder to everybody just how volatile this can be.'

The new evacuations were in addition to more than 20,000 orders issued 
Wednesday. About 85,000 people live in San Marcos.

Since
 the first blazed erupted Tuesday during a heat wave, officials have 
repeatedly predicted the worst was over only to be confronted by a new 
challenge amid the hot, dry and windy conditions.

The
 fires have destroyed eight houses, an 18-unit condominium complex and 
two businesses and burned more than 15 square miles, causing more than 
$20 million in damage so far.

The flare-up in 
San Marcos ran up a slope in a heavily vegetated area but with no wind 
on it. The fire was being driven by fuel and topography, said Division 
Chief Dave Allen of the California Department of Forestry and Fire 
Protection.

'It's created its own weather pattern there as it sucks oxygen in,' he told a news conference.

State fire Capt. Kendal Bortisser said the fire was running east along hillsides behind California State University San Marcos.

The
 1.56-square-mile blaze was only 5 per cent contained.

The fire, which 
broke out Wednesday, forced the evacuation of the university campus 
where nearly 10,000 students were in the middle of final exams. 
Graduation ceremonies were canceled.

Investigators were trying to determine the causes of the various fires.

Asked
 about the possibility of arson, the sheriff said he wouldn't prejudge 
the investigations. He noted that sparks from vehicles can easily ignite
 brush in such dry conditions.

Emergency 
officials said a significant number of firefighting aircraft had become 
available, including four air tankers and 22 military helicopters, in 
addition to local agency helicopters.

Ten of 
the military helicopters were being used to battle a blaze that grew to 
9.37 square miles on the Marine Corps' Camp Pendleton. Despite its 
growth, the fire was 20 percent contained and was no longer considered a
 threat to communities.

Twelve other military helicopters were available to the county.

Since
 the fires began, 125,000 evacuation notices have been sent, officials 
said. Schools also have been shut down and the Legoland amusement park 
had to close Wednesday. It reopened Thursday.

 Saska stood in front of his charred Carlsbad home Thursday in sandals 
that showed his soot-covered feet. He said he was not impressed with the
 fire response.

'I don't want to complain but I
 wish they had just made a little more effort to put the fire out,' 
Saska said. 'The end of the house right there that you see was still 
burning.

And they (firefighters) just left. And I'm just kinda going, 
What would've been the big deal to stay here another 10 minutes and put 
that out totally. I just don't get it.'

Firefighters
 have been contending with sweltering heat in their fight to contain 
flames fueled by brush and trees left brittle by drought. Temperatures 
on Thursday ranged from the high 90s to 100.

Officials
 said a Carlsbad-area blaze that has been the most destructive so far 
was 75 percent contained and had burned 400 acres.

The wildfire 
destroyed an 18-unit condominium complex and four residences, Carlsbad 
Mayor Matt Hall said.

Some evacuation orders were being lifted in Carlsbad, but hotspots were still a concern.

Numerous schools will be closed Friday, officials said.
