A Boston housing director who earned a hefty $360,000 salary and managed low-income housing only spent 15 days on the job this year.

The rest of the year, Michael E. McLaughlin was travelling the country, doing business elsewhere, working remotely, or not putting in a full eight-hour workday.

He served as one of the highest-paid public housing officials in the country, and yet took 47 days of vacation in 2011 alone, during a time of grim realities in the housing market.

Cashing in: Michael McLaughlin earned $360,000 for 15 full days work, and cashed in for 'unused' vacation time

The Boston Globe uncovered cellphone records of Mr McLaughlin and pointed out that while he had claimed over $80,000 in ‘unused’ vacation time and sick time.

He was only on-site in the low-income Chelsea neighbourhood of Boston for 15 days total in 2011.

‘The office was just a place (McLaughlin) stopped to delegate to everyone what to do,’ an anonymous housing authority employee told the Globe.

The employee said that Mr McLaughlin would come in slightly before 10am and leave in the early afternoon, often around 1pm.

'These are disturbing allegations (that) further indicates that our efforts to remove the former executive director and board members were the right thing to do.'

-Greg Bialecki, secretary of the Executive Office of Housing and Economic Development

Mr McLaughlin resigned swiftly last month after his extraordinary salary and pitiful attendance was revealed.

His work for the Chelsea Housing Authority was often spent in Maine and Florida, The Boston Globe reported.

He claimed near-perfect health, only reporting 3.5 hours of sick time in more than a decade of work. On his last day of work, he wrote himself a $114,237 check which compensated him for the ‘unused’ sick time.

Officials tried to claim the check, but he had already cashed it.

Following his departure, the FBI is investigating whether or not Mr McLaughlin has illegally diverted federal funds.

‘These are disturbing allegations,’ Secretary of the Executive Office of Housing and Economic Development said in a statement.

Help for the hurting: Chelsea Housing Authority provides aid for low-income families and the elderly looking for affordable housing in the Boston area

According to their website, the authority administers two housing programs – rental assistance and public housing, both of which help low-income families find places to live.

His deputy assistant and friend Linda Thibodau kept a similarly luxurious schedule, and didn’t show up to the Chelsea neighbourhood of Massachusetts that often.

Ms Thibodau, who started working for Mr McLaughlin in 2001, was earning a padded wage for the amount of time she worked.

Ten years later, she was earning $99,000, which included a 2009 stipend given to her by the board of directors for ‘added…duties,’ the Globe reported.

She and Mr McLaughlin often visited Naples, Florida, but did not count it as vacation time, even though as little as a quarter of all calls made while in Florida were to the housing authority.

Mr McLaughlin’s contract also allowed him to sell unused vacation and sick days back to the housing authority.
