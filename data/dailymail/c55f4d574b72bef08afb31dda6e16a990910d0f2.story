Television fans now face paying bills of more than £100 if they want access to live sport and the latest hit shows.

The rise of production costs and increasing competition between web-streaming services mean many pay for multiple television packages bundled with their broadband and phone lines.

On-demand services like Netflix offer viewers more choice than ever before as well as exclusive programming - but at a hefty price.

Watching popular shows like Game of Thrones, Orange is the New Black and former BBC drama Ripper Street as well as every Premier League match would require a subscription to Sky Atlantic, Netflix, Amazon Prime Instant Video and Sky Sports.

The Guardian reported that if those services are bought directly, it would cost around £792 a year or £839 in HD - on top of a £145.50 TV licence. 

But Sky, Virgin Media and TalkTalk's top packages, which include all the best shows and broadband, now all cost more than £1,000 a year.

The phenomenal success of event television programmes like Breaking Bad - which was put on Netflix for UK viewers immediately after airing across the Atlantic and Kevin Spacey's House of Cards - mean on-demand services have begun producing their own programming not available elsewhere. 

The choice of services has exploded within the last few years, with options range from Sky's Now TV service for those who do not want a Sky TV contract or using YouView with a BT or TalkTalk contract to access channels and on-demand shows without a satellite.  

Sky Sports subscribers can watch every single Barclays Premier League match - but it comes at a hefty cost 

Event programming like Netflix's House of Cards starring Kevin Spacey have made Netflix more popular 

But viewers who find themselves paying more should consider bundling their services – buying broadband, telephone and TV together – to save money and simplify bills. 

An Ofcom spokesperson said many viewers had experienced 'real-term price increases for certain packages'.

Recent figures show BT's overall average revenue per user has grown 7% year on year to £404 a year. 

Sky's has gone up from £504 in 2010 to £574 this year and Virgin's is £588 a year – up 2% year on year.

Sky's Complete Bundle comes with all the channels plus Sky Movies HD and Sky Sports HD, but it costs £71.25 a month (half price for the first six months).

Virgin is offering Netflix free for six months and including BT Sport in packages that start from £20 a month.

Netflix alone costs £5.99 a month.

The best value Amazon Prime Instant Video plan includes one-day delivery of millions of items at £79 a year.
