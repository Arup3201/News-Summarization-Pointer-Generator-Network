Three civilians have today been killed during artillery fire in the separatist stronghold of Donetsk as fighting escalated following the disputed arrival of a Russian aid convoy.

Pictures show the bodies lying in the street, covered in white sheets, in the aftermath of the deadly shelling attack which targeted neighbourhoods across the eastern Ukraine city overnight and this morning.

Relatives gathered round the corpses to mourn the victims, two of whom were hit while waiting at a bus stop, according to reports.

The third victim died while being treated for shrapnel wounds in hospital.  

According to the Donetsk mayor's office and the regional branch of the Ukrainian Emergencies Service, several blocks of flats were struck, while a school was damaged in the Petrovsky district.

The attack comes as German Chancellor Angela Merkel arrived in Kiev for crisis talks with Ukraine's pro-Western leaders as the controversial aid convoy from Moscow began crossing back into Russia.

Ahead of meeting Ukraine's president Petro Poroshenko, Merkel said she would advise him 'that the conflict can only be resolved politically and that a cease-fire must be reached as soon as possible.'

The West had demanded that Russia withdraw the disputed trucks after the Kremlin unilaterally sent them to the insurgent stronghold of Lugansk on Friday in a move Kiev described as an 'invasion'.

An observer for the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) at the border said some of the white lorries had returned to Russia but could not specify how many were still inside Ukraine.

US President Barack Obama and Merkel warned Putin during a telephone conversation last week that the decision to send in the convoy marked a 'dangerous escalation' of the four months of conflict  with Western fears mounting that it could lead to Moscow sending in troops.

The European Union and the United States both called for the Kremlin to pull out the trucks immediately or face further isolation.

Their actions have driven cross-border tensions to a new high ahead the visit to Kiev by the German leader.

Russia said the trucks covered in white tarpaulins were carrying food, water, generators and sleeping bags. Some trucks were opened to reporters a few days ago, and at least some of those items could be seen.

However Ukrainian officials insisted that they were being used for military purposes and were blocked by the Kiev government as they reached the checkpoint.  

In a separate development, Nato said it has mounting evidence that Russian troops are operating inside Ukraine and launching artillery attacks from Ukrainian soil - but Russia has also rejected that accusation.

It remained unclear today what the Russian convoy had actually delivered.

At the United Nations in New York, Russian Ambassador Vitaly Churkin rejected accusations that Russian troops were inside Ukraine. Russia has also steadfastly denied supporting and arming the rebels.

The fighting in eastern Ukraine began in mid-April, a month after Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimean peninsula.

The United Nations says more than 2,000 people have been killed and 340,000 forced to flee their homes during the fighting. 

In the past week, continuous shelling has destroyed homes in neighbourhoods across Donetsk as the fighting increases in intensity
