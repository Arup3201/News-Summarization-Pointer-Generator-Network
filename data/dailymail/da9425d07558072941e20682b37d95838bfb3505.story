India captain MS Dhoni has retired from Test cricket with immediate effect following the draw with Australia in Melbourne.

The wicketkeeper batsman helped saved the match for the tourists at the MCG but then announced immediately after that he would be stepping down to concentrate on the shorter forms of the game.

Dhoni exits with one Test of the four-match series to go Down Under - Australia are winning 2-0 and have already won the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.

Virat Kohli will captain the side in Sydney, with the Test starting on January 6.

India great Sachin Tendulkar tweeted: 'Well done on a wonderful career in test cricket @msdhoni. Always enjoyed playing together. Next target 2015 WC my friend!!'

BCCI secretary Sanjay Patel paid tribute to Dhoni, who made his 90th and now final Test appearance in Melbourne.

'One of India's greatest Test captains under whose leadership India became the number one team in the Test rankings, MS Dhoni has decided to retire from Test cricket citing the strain of playing all formats of cricket,' he said in a statement released by the BCCI.

'MS Dhoni has chosen to retire from Test cricket with immediate effect in order to concentrate on ODI and T20 formats.

'BCCI, while respecting the decision of MS Dhoni to retire from Test cricket, wishes to thank him for his enormous contribution to Test cricket and the laurels that he has brought to India.' 

Dhoni seems to have lost interest in Test cricket over the past few months, with the defeat in Australia preceded by a loss in England after being ahead in the series.

He also lost to England in India in 2012, the first time his nation had lost a home Test series for eight years.

India were, however, the No 1 Test side in the world for 18 months until 2011 (when they were thrashed 4-0 by England) and it statistics back up what a fine leader he was. 

His Test win percentage of 45 per cent is the highest of any Indian captain who led the side for at least five matches.

And he hit the most runs by an Indian Test captain, 3,454. The great opener Sunil Gavaskar hit 3,449.

His final innings was the 24 not out which salvaged a draw against Australia in Melbourne. 

India's middle-order batsman Suresh Raina tweeted: 'Valiant while you led. Valiant in your departure. #Respect @msdhoni'.
