The auto-tuned news interview celebrity shocked many four months ago when he announced that he’s decided to become straight. Having not been seen in public with any women, the announcement came and went without much fanfare – until Tuesday.

‘I just became the happiest man alive!! My beautiful Queen and I are having a baby!!’ Mr Dodson tweeted at 9:22pm Tuesday night.

Almost as if he was in disbelief himself, Mr Dodson told TMZ ‘we took two tests to be sure.’

‘I’m having a baby – no hoax, no joke,’ Mr Dodson added.

The bizarre interview continued with an incredulous Harvey Levin – himself gay – asking Mr Dodson if he directly impregnated his ‘Queen.’

‘Directly impregnated that I really do love,’ Mr Dodson replied, ‘ I really do love this girl.’‘Fair enough,’ said Mr Levin.

Calling his becoming straight a ‘process,’ Mr Dodson then explained that while he announced his heterosexuality four months ago, the expectant father called it ‘a year thingy.’

‘Okay, well, fair enough, best of luck to you’ said Mr Levin, shrugging his shoulders.

Mr Dodson announced he was straight at the same time he proclaimed himself the ‘True Chosen Hebrew Israelite descendant of Judah’ on Facebook.

‘I have to renounce myself, I'm no longer into homosexuality I want a wife and family, I want to multiply and raise and love my family that I create,’ Mr Dodson wrote.

Mr Dodson became famous in August 2010 when he was shown in a news interview about his sister fighting off a man found by his sister in her bed. The Hunstville, AL., man’s enigmatic interview went viral and has been seen by millions.

The song was soon remixed by The Gregory Brothers, two DJs famous for auto-tuning news reports. The YouTube video has over 117million views and the iTunes song has sold millions of copies.
