 A gang of copper thieves who ‘colluded’ with crooked BT employees to steal quarter of a million pounds worth of underground cables have been jailed for a total of 32 and a half years.

The thieves stole a telecoms van complete with overalls so they could pose as workers for the company and trawled London looking for redundant cabling which could be pulled up, stripped down and sold.

In total the gang caused a £279,635 loss to BT in terms of stolen property and damage before the cables were seized at a scrapyard in Dagenham, Essex.

Zeki Mehmed, 54, left, who had worked for BT for 30 years, was jailed for four and a half years while John Harding, 52, right, was sentenced to five years behind bars after the gang stole cabling worth around £280,000

Simon Read, 40, and Ricky Read, 24, both of Chadwell Heath, Essex, posed as workmen as part of the plot

Simon Read, along with Jamie Summerscales, Jamie Ratford, Ryan Wiley, Kieron Madden, Ricky Read and Simeon Ramsey all posed as roadside workmen, wearing high visibility vests and setting up cordons and cones, when they carried out the thefts.

The gang committed a large number of thefts over a six month period between April and early December 2012, operating at different times of the day and night.

Prior to embarking on these expeditions the thieves received crucial tip-offs from BT employee Zeki Mehmed that enabled them to successfully target specific sites all over London and the Home Counties.

Once stolen, the metal was transferred to another vehicle before being taken to an east London scrap yard where John Harding worked, who alongside Tommy Taylor, handled; valued and exchanged the metal for cash.

Cables were stolen from sites across the capital including in Wood Street in Walthamstow, east London, and Oakley Road, Canonbury, Islington, Snaresbrook Crown Court heard.

Tim Naylor, prosecuting, said: ‘This was an ongoing conspiracy to steal redundant cables from BT.

‘They stole from various locations in London which were to be deposited and stripped to be sold for huge profit.

‘This
was a criminal enterprise to steal metal cabling belonging to BT and 
they used vans, uniforms and equipment to retrieve the cabling.

Ryan Wiley, 26, left, and Jamie Summerscales, 40, right, were both jailed for three years and eight months

Jamie Ratford, left, and Keiron Madden, right, both 33, were also sentenced to three years and eight months after they pleaded guilty to conspiracy to steal

‘Everything
stolen was redundant cabling but this does not take from the fact it 
was a sophisticated and well organised enterprise which caused huge 
losses.

‘A BT cable van was
stolen and there were no signs of a forced entry which would suggest 
they would have colluded with at least one BT employee to gain access.’

Mr
Naylor said gang members posed as roadside workmen, wearing high 
visibility vests and setting up cordons and cones before thieving the 
cable.

They stole between one and three tonnes of BT cable each time they struck with each tonne worth a few thousand pounds.

On December, 13, 2012, officers swooped on a scrap yard following a six-month long intelligence-led specialist operation designed to catch the key players red-handed as they followed their regular routine of exchanging tonnes of stolen cable for thousands of pounds in cash.

Simeon Ramsey, 34, was jailed for eight months to run consecutively with another sentence he is currently serving for theft. Tommy Taylor, right, was ordered to carry out community service

Detectives also seized a stolen BT van packed with two tonnes of copper cable, worth thousands of pounds which was used by the gang on their regular expeditions to steal.

Police said that the van had a detachable £50,000 winch to retrieve the cable from underground via manhole covers.

Mehmed, 54, who had worked for BT for 30 years, was jailed for four and a half years for his role while another ringleader, John Harding, 52, was jailed for five years.

Simon Read, 40, was given four years 
while Summerscales, 40, Ricky Read, 24, Ratford, 33, Wiley, 26, and Madden, 33, were each jailed for three years and 
eight months.

Ramsey,
34, was jailed for eight months to run consecutively with a three years
and four month sentence he is currently serving for theft.

Simon
Read, Ricky Read and Madden, all of Chadwell Heath, Essex, 
Summerscales, of West Ham, London, Ratford of Woolwich, London, Wiley, 
of Hornchurch, and Ramsey, of Harlesden all pleaded guilty to conspiracy
to steal.

The gang were sentenced at Snaresbrook Crown Court in London

Harding of Romford Essex, and Mehmed of Potters Bar, 
Hertfordshire, were convicted of the same charge following a trial in 
October.

Tommy Taylor, 36, of Meadow Lane, Wickford, Essex, was handed a nine
month sentence suspended for 18 months and given 220 hours community 
service after he was found guilty of conspiracy to steal.

Acting Detective Superintendent Neil Thompson of the MPS London Crime Squad said: ‘This was a highly organised criminal network who threatened the very infrastructure of the country, putting the public at risk through their reckless disregard of the communications networks. 

‘The offence was heightened by intelligence provided by a BT employee to the gang. The London Crime Squad has worked tirelessly alongside BT investigators to bring the offenders to justice.’

Kevin Brown, of BT security and corporate investigations, said: ‘BT will not tolerate any level of criminal behaviour. We will continue to work closely with the Metropolitan Police Service, assisting with their investigations to target organised crime, and do everything possible to catch cable theft criminals.’
