When most people think of breast surgery, they envisage augmentations or reductions.

But another cosmetic procedure is on the rise among women desperate for 'perfect' breasts.

Areola reduction surgery is aimed at women who are unhappy with either the size or shape of their areolae, the brown or pink area surrounding the nipple.

Women who are insecure about the size or shape of brown or pink area surrounding their nipples are resorting to surgery

Some women believe their areolae are too wide, raised, non-circular or uneven in colour and are now resorting to surgery to tackle the problem.

The procedure is performed by removing a circular area of the outer area of the areola and bringing in the skin around it to reduce and tighten it.

Absorbable stitches are used inside the areola to reduce the diameter. In many cases, surgeons will use a permanent stitch which they place deep in the breast tissue to prevent the areola from widening after surgery.

One woman who is considering surgery said her nipples has been compared 'Hob Nob biscuits'

Helena, 33, who lives in London, who had been hiding her nipple insecurity for years was ecstatic when she heard about the surgery.

She said ‘As soon as I hit puberty I 
realised my nipples were unlike other girls. They just got bigger and 
bigger – and they were much darker than my friends’ nipples.

‘Getting changed for swimming was mortifying – I was worried everyone was looking at me.

‘My first boyfriend jokingly compared 
them to Hob Nob biscuits. He meant it fondly but that description stayed
 with me – and I’ve never been able to move on from it. I’ve felt 
self-conscious with every man I’ve ever undressed in front of.

‘They have also been compared to 
Scotch pancakes. They are so disproportionately large - it makes me so 
paranoid.

Leteysha Grace, of MTV's The Valleys, was so upset by comments about her breasts that she's now considering nipple reduction surgery

'I don’t feel at all sexy with my top off. I can’t imagine how 
any man could find them attractive.

‘My friend told me her nipples got 
larger and darker when she was pregnant and breastfeeding. The very 
thought fills me with fear.

‘I’d never heard about nipple reduction surgery before  - I thought I was stuck with them.

‘Now that I know it exists I’m going to save up to have it done.’

The surgery involves removing skin from the outer area of the areola

And Helena is not alone - Leteysha Grace, of MTV's The Valleys, is considering the surgery after suffering at the hands of bullies.

Leteysha was horrified by the onslaught of abuse she received on Twitter after she appeared topless in a Zoo magazine shoot.

Speaking to Heat magazine, she said: 'I'm having my nipples corrected because I'm not happy with the way my boobs look.

'I can't even take my bra off during sex. I don't know if I'll still have sensitivity after the surgery, but, to be honest, I don't really care.'

However, a loss of sensation isn't the main issue with this type of surgery.

Miles Berry, co-author of The Good Boob Bible explains: 'If too much skin is removed, scars can stretch so expectations are a key part of preoperative discussions.

 The average areola is approximately 4.5 
cm in diameter. Sometimes an enlarged areola is caused by the natural 
sagging of breasts due to age or breast-feeding

'However, I feel the trend is growing and results are usually very good, if the above points are taken into consideration.'

Plastic surgeon Dr. Yannis Alexandrides, founder of clinic 111 Harley Street, said of the surgery: 'Women who are self conscious because they have large areolae, need not worry because there is a simple correction that can be performed under local anaesthetic.

'An average areola is approximately 4.5 cm in diameter. Sometimes a large areola goes together with natural sagging of breasts due to age or breast-feeding.

'If you want to have a breast reduction or a breast lift done, the areola may be reduced at the same time to the desired size. An areola reduction can also be performed without additional surgery.

'Through an incision in the outer part of the nipple of the areola, the pigmented skin around the nipple or areola is removed. This procedure may leave a small scar around the areola.

'An areola reduction does not cause any problems with future breast feeding.'
