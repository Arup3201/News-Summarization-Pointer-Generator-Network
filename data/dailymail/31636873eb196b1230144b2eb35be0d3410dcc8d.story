It was a not-so-balmy 30 degrees fahrenheit in Walpole, Massachusetts, on Monday morning, and, like many residents of the Boston suburb, a 44-year-old high school teacher donned his winter hat to combat the inclement weather.

Only problem is, the only other article of clothing forestry teacher Marc Mertz was wearing Monday morning as he sauntered up and down his driveway were swimming goggles and a towel - and he eventually ditched the towel.

Mertz - a teacher at Norfolk County Agricultural High School - was arrested Wednesday after several witnesses watched him walking around his driveway wearing only a ski hat.

History: Authorities say teacher Marc Mertz has been accused of exposing himself in public on more than one occasion

Brrrr: This is the driveway where multiple witnesses saw Mertz walking around naked on Monday

The first witness to call 9-1-1 was absolutely shocked when she saw Mertz walking around in the snow in the buff.

'There was just a nude man walking down his driveway. He’s got a ski cap
 on and no clothes. I don’t know if he’s still there or not but I just 
saw him, very weird. I don’t know who he is or if he lives there or what
 he does, but all I know is this guy was stark naked,' the witness is heard saying on a 9-1-1 tape obtained by WHDH.

Another witness told authorities that Mertz did more than just walk around while 'stark naked.'

'He was naked and he began to gyrate toward his mailbox as the victim drove by,' Walpole Deputy Police Chief John Carmichael said.

This isn't Mertz' first brush with the law - in 2012, he also was accused of exposing himself in public.

'He had apparently exposed himself to some boaters at a lake in Natick, I don’t know if he was arrested,' Carmichael said.

When he has his clothes on, parents describe Mertz as a good teacher.

'He was a good teacher, my daughter had him for a couple classes. I met 
him a once or twice, seemed like a nice guy to me,' one man told the station.

Regardless, Mertz now faces some serious criminal charges - and his teaching job could potentially be in jeopardy.

Hi praise: Parents of children taught by Mertz describe his as an excellent teacher

'We charged him with open and gross lewdness. Part of the elements of that crime are the victim must have been shocked and alarmed by the behavior that was exhibited. In this case both victims were shocked and alarmed,” Carmichael said.

Mertz has been placed on administrative leave from Norfolk County Agricultural High School as an investigation into the alleged incident continues.
