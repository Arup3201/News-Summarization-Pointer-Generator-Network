The workers of Generation Y are getting a name for themselves.

Managers from Gen Y are widely perceived as self-entitled and don’t score particularly highly when it comes to being a team player.

Generation Y is defined as people aged between 18 and 32. It finds that they’re moving into management at a rapid pace.

Reputation: Gen Y are widely perceived as self-entitled and don¿t score particularly highly when it comes to being a team player

Tech-savvy: Compared to their Generation X counterparts, Generation Y workers are adaptable, expect flexible conditions and and familiar with using technology to do their jobs

New newly released research from EY, the global firm that includes Ernst & Young LLP suggests 87 percent of Gen Y managers have taken on a new management role in the last five years, compared with 38 percent of older Gen X managers and 19 percent of aging baby boomer managers.

Gen Y workers now accounts for around a third of the American workforce.

The survey found the work group are seen as being ‘entitled and concerned primarily about individual promotion.’

Workers who feel they are owed things 
from their organization and that their excellence is a given, are less 
likely to lead teams effectively and advocate for subordinates NBC News 
reports.

A 2010 study by 
Paul Harvey, an assistant professor of management at the University of 
New Hampshire, found that entitled employees are more likely to feel 
frustrated on the job and to lash out at colleagues.

'The
 frustration experienced by entitled workers appears to stem from 
perceived inequities in the rewards received by co-workers to whom 
psychologically entitled employees feel superior,’ Mr Harvey told NBC.

Generation
 Y's management problem may be inexperience. For those that are a part 
of Generation X (aged between 33 and 48) were found to be the strongest 
managers in the survey.

Karyn Twaronite who works for EY who conducted the study cautions people from dismissing the study as generational rubbish.

‘If managers think this is something that will simply fix itself, they are mistaken,’ she said. ‘There is a real shift.’

Selfish outlook: New research suggests Generation Y workers are self-entitled and expect promotion within their jobs as a virtual right

In some of the survey’s other results, it was found that Generation Y placed a high value on being flexible in the workplace.

A roughly equal number of respondents from both Gen X and Gen Y said they would walk away from a job that didn't offer adequate flexibility.

Fewer than half of Gen Y members expect to be working standard office hours five to 10 years from now.

On the plus side of thing, Gen Y members are seen as being tech smart and savvy.

They are also perceived as being enthusiastic, adaptable and ambitious.
