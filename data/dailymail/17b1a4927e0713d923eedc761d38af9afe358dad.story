A police bodyguard who had affairs with both Alan Johnson’s wife and his aide while he was protecting the MP was sacked last night.

Paul Rice, 45, was dismissed following a two-day misconduct hearing into his serial womanising which led to the resignation of the Shadow Chancellor.

The Scotland Yard close protection officer had been suspended since January this year after confessing to superiors he had a relationship with Laura Johnson.

Their affair was exposed when Mr Johnson resigned, citing ‘personal issues in my private life’.

Rice, who was 61-year-old Mr Johnson’s protection officer, had an affair with his 47-year-old wife when he was Home Secretary.

He also having a relationship with the Labour MP’s constituency assistant Tracy Windle, 50, during the same period – June 2009 to May 2010.

Rice was assigned to protect the Home Secretary a few months after his own marriage broke down.

He later divorced his wife, Michelle, 42, with whom he has a nine-year-old son.

His disciplinary hearing, which was held in private, heard lurid details of how Mr Johnson’s wife cheated on her husband with his bodyguard. To spare their blushes, the former minister, his wife and aide were not called as witnesses.

The panel heard how the officer arranged to meet the MP’s wife for secret trysts when he was off duty.

Mr Johnson has been married to Laura, his second wife, for almost 20 years. Her affair with the policeman is said to be over but the Johnsons’ marriage has been damaged beyond repair.

Rice, who lives in Watford, was dismissed without notice for discreditable conduct.
