Jack Wilshere and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain may be Arsenal and England team-mates on the pitch - but they were bitter rivals in the dugout on Thursday.

Both Arsenal midfielders managed their own sides in the final of the 2014 England Footballers Foundation Charity Cup - with Wilshere's Jack the Lads FC coming out on top.

Oxlade-Chamberlain guided his Murder on Zidane's Floor side through to the final but he was eventually out-manoeuvred by Wilshere, who managed his side to a second cup in two years.

Fellow Arsenal stars Danny Welbeck and Calum Chambers also managed sides at the event, held at The London Soccerdome, in aid of UNICEF.

But it was Wilshere who can walk away with the bragging rights and tell his own boss Arsene Wenger that his job might not be safe for too much longer if the England midfielder can continue to develop his own coaching skills... 

Arsenal host winless Burnley in the Premier League at the Emirates on Saturday.

A victory could see the Gunners move into the top four.
