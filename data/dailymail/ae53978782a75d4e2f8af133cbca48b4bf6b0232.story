Manchester United earned a hard-fought three points at Loftus Road on Saturday with a 2-0 victory over Queens Park Rangers.

Marouane Fellaini and James Wilson came off the bench at half-time to score the goals and give Louis van Gaal's side victory.

QUEENS PARK RANGERS

Rob Green - 8.5

Produced three excellent saves from Radamel Falcao but was too exposed by his team-mates for both goals.

Mauricio Isla - 7

Did great work to keep Rooney quiet, couldn't get forward as much as he usually does. 

Richard Dunne (Steven Caulker 46) - 6.5

Commanding first-half performance but withdrawn at the break through injury.

Nedum Onuoha - 6

A surprise inclusion ahead of Steven Caulker and Rio Ferdinand but did well. 

Clint Hill - 6

The most committed 36-year-old footballer in the Premier League, possibly anywhere. 

Eduardo Vargas - 5.5

The creative Chilean was pretty anonymous as QPR's game-plan was based on frustrating United.

Joey Barton - 5

Should have conceded a penalty for his trip on Wayne Rooney in the box.

Karl Henry - 6

A typically dogged performance from the midfielder with relentless running and covering for his team-mates. 

Leroy Fer (Adel Taarabt 70) - 6

One of the few QPR players composed on the ball, he was not afraid to shoot either.

Charlie Austin - 7

Could have had two first-half goals but was twice denied by an inspired David de Gea. 

Bobby Zamora (Niko Kranjcar 80) - 7

Could have had two first-half goals but was twice denied by an inspired David De Gea.

Substitutes

Steven Caulker (for Dunne 46) - 6

Adel Taarabt (for Fer 70) - 5

Niko Kranjcar (for Zamora 80) - 4 

Subs not used  

Rio Ferdinand, Alex McCarthy,  Junior Hoilett, Adel Taarabt, Mauro Zarate

Manager: Harry Redknapp - 6

Harry Redknapp's future should be safe after this narrow defeat and his set-up was correct for most of the match. No room for new signing Mauro Zarate begs the question: why sign him?

MANCHESTER UNITED

David de Gea - 8

Denied Charlie Austin twice in the first-half - a feat most goalkeepers have failed to match this season. 

Phil Jones - 7.5

Strange to see the defender taking corners, he didn't have much else to do, though. 

Jonny Evans (James Wilson 57) - 7

The centre back did little wrong and coped with Zamora and Austin before exiting early with an injury.

Marcos Rojo - 7

Enjoyed a bruising encounter with Zamora, never ducked a challenge. 

Daley Blind - 7 

The ball largely bypassed the midfield so it was a quiet day for the Dutchman.

Michael Carrick - 7.5

QPR's small pitch and smothering approach limited his range of passing. 

Antonio Valencia - 7

Guilty of a foul throw in the first-half, a shameful crime even in park football. 

Juan Mata (Marouane Fellaini 46) - 4

Too many stray passes from the midfielder, petulant yellow card summed-up his contribution, hauled off at the break.

Wayne Rooney - 7.5

Frustrating day for the United skipper who was played out of position on the left flank. 

Angel di Maria (Ander Herrera 90) - 7

Started up-front but was too lightweight to hold the ball up against QPR's powerful centre backs. 

Radamel Falcao - 5

Should have scored at least three. A horrible individual showing for a man trying to prove he's worth £240,000 a week.

Substitutes:

Marouane Fellaini (replaced Mata 46) - 8

James Wilson (replaced Evans 57) - 8

Ander Herrera (for Di Maria 90) 

Subs not used: 

Adnan Januzaj, Chris Smalling, Victor Valdes, Paddy McNair

Manager: Louis van Gaal - 7

The Fellaini substitution and the timing of the goal looks like a masterstroke but it might have just been Louis van Gaal papering over cracks.
