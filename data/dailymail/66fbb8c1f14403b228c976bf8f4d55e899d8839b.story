Ed Miliband received a much-needed boost today after Labour comfortably held off Ukip in a crunch police commissioner election.

Labour's candidate for the South Yorkshire police post, Alan Billings, scooped just over half the 148,062 votes cast – with Ukip's Jack Clarkson trailing in second place on 31.66 per cent.

A senior Labour source said the party had 'took Ukip on and won' despite Nigel Farage's pledge to go after Mr Miliband's core vote.

It comes after Nigel Farage yesterday told MailOnline the election was 'nip and tuck'.

The by-election – which was marred by turnout of just 14 per cent - was sparked by the resignation of Labour's former police and crime commissioner Shaun Wright in the wake of the Rotherham sex abuse scandal.

Mr Wright stood down under intense pressure after an official report revealed more than 1,400 children had been sexually assaulted by gangs of mainly-Asian men in Rotherham.

He was the councillor who oversaw children's services in the town between 2005 and 2010.

Mr Farage had hoped Ukip would build on the party's recent by-election victory in Clacton and close second in Heywood and Middleton by getting its first Police and Crime Commissioner.

The party came fourth when Mr Wright was elected in 2012 but has since boosted its vote by 20 per cent.

A Labour source said: 'Nigel Farage said he was putting his tanks on our lawn. We took Ukip on and won.

'Let's see if (David) Cameron can do the same in Rochester and Strood (by-election).'

Labour leader Ed Miliband, who represents Doncaster North, tweeted: 'Congratulations to Labour's @AlanBillingsPCC - he will bring experience, independence and a fresh start to South Yorkshire Police.'

Ukip has exploited the Rotherham child abuse scandal - where 1,400 children were abused - to attack Labour

Conservative candidate Ian Walker won just 12.52 per cent while English Democrat David Allen secured 5.8 per cent. The Liberal Democrats did not field a candidate.

Dr Billings said: 'In political terms it brings the Ukip advance to a shuddering halt in South Yorkshire and I think that they're deeply disappointed to do so badly.

'That's very gratifying for us because I think that if we can turn the tide here we can turn it in other places as well.

'So a message of huge encouragement for the Labour Party and absolute disappointment for Ukip.'

He said: 'I'm very pleased. It's been very, very hard fought. Given the circumstances it's very gratifying that the Labour Party is able to re-establish itself in South Yorkshire as a credible force.'

Dr Billings rejected the idea that it was a tight contest. He said: 'We won on the first count. It could have gone to a second count but it didn't and we won.' 

Mr Clarkson called for a criminal investigation into the Rotherham scandal.

He said: 'I want a criminal investigation. We don't want candy floss and forgiveness. We want a criminal investigation into what took place involving these children.

'And that involves the police, social services, council officials, councillors and any other agency. I believe there was collusion, assistance and turning of a blind eye, which is just as bad.

'If Mr Billings doesn't get this right, believe you me, there'll be people again demonstrating on the streets of Rotherham. They're wanting to see action.' He said the turnout was 'very poor'.

Mr Clarkson added: 'South Yorkshire is a hard nut to crack but I'll tell you what - Ukip are in there now and Labour have got to be looking over their shoulder at us.'
