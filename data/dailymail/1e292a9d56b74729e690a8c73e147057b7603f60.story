She is Britain’s first and only woman Prime Minister, and the longest-serving for 150 years.

And now, to celebrate her unique place in British history, a statue of Lady Thatcher could be erected in her home town of Grantham, after Labour councillors changed their minds and backed the proposal.

Until now, the Lincolnshire market town town had been split over plans for a statue of Lady Thatcher with some fearing it could be a target for vandals and protesters.

Lady Thatcher stands next to the £150,000 white marble statue of her in 2002. Shortly after, it was famously decapitated by a protester. Now restored, it has been offered to the Grantham Museum

More than two decades after her fall 
from power, it had been suggested that Grantham Museum could house a repaired white marble statue.

Grantham museum said that any 
decision would be taken with the views of local residents in mind but that proposal is off the table.

But Lady Thatcher seems to have found an unlikely ally, with Labour councillors proposing a separate commemorative work to attract tourists, the Daily Telegraph reported.

Charmaine Morgan, has called on the Conservative majority to support an exhibit and statue or bust of Lady Thatcher.

She told the Daily Telegraph: 'Despite our personal strength of feeling about her, we feel the controversy and outside interest around Lady Thatcher provides an opportunity to attract international tourists to our town.'

The 
8ft £150,000 artwork originally proposed was made by sculptor Neil Simmons and commissioned by the 
House of Commons and was decapitated by a protester within weeks of 
going on display at a gallery in the City of London in 2002.

It has spent much of the period since its repair in storage at the Commons.

Cllr Morgan previously suggested that displaying a monument to Lady Thatcher could be ‘asking 
for trouble’. 

She said some of Lady Thatcher’s policies 
remain controversial and the statue might be open to more attacks if it 
was erected in her home town. ‘Placing it anywhere in a public place in 
Grantham, it could be open to a similar event occurring,’ Miss Morgan 
said. 

Lady Thatcher, who won three general 
elections and was Prime Minister between 1979 and 1990, was born and 
went to school in Grantham. But at the former grocery shop and post 
office where Margaret Hilda Roberts grew up, there is nothing more than a
small plaque.

The shop is now a holistic centre, and
her childhood bedroom is used for massage therapy. Despite calls from 
successive mayors for a statue of Lady Thatcher, her legacy seems to be 
so divisive that such proposals have never got beyond the planning 
stage. Grantham lies within Tory-controlled South Kesteven District 
Council.

The Neil Simmons statue was unveiled 
by the former prime minister in 2002, but attacked with a metal pole at 
Guildhall Art Gallery by theatre producer Paul Kelleher two months 
later.

The grocer's daughter, who went on to be PM from 1979 until 1990, was born in Grantham and went to Kesteven and Grantham Girls' School. She is seen above visiting the school in 1982

Jayne Robb, manager of Grantham 
Museum, said: ‘It does need to go somewhere, but how the town responds 
to the life of Margaret Thatcher has to be a town decision.’

Grantham already has a statue and 
shopping centre dedicated to a famous son, Sir Isaac Newton, and many 
think it is time for Lady Thatcher, now 87, to be honoured.

‘If you were walking through the town 
you would never know she had anything to do it,’ said poultry manager 
Duncan Attwood, 39. ‘Tourists come from all over the world because it is
where she is from.’

Teaching assistant Michelle Carter, 
33, added: ‘A lot of things she did weren’t popular with Labour voters 
but she was our first woman prime minister and for that she should be 
recognised. Who knows when the next one will come along?’

A bronze statue of Lady Thatcher, unveiled in 2007, stands in the Members’ Lobby at the House of Commons.
