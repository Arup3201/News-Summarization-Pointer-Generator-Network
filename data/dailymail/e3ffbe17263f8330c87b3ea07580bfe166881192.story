A waterfront restaurant that has been plagued with problems for years sank this morning - and not just in the financial sense. 

The Waterfront Restaurant in Hebron, Kentucky, was underwater on Tuesday morning at its dock. 

The owner, Jeff Ruby, tweeted a photograph of the submerged flamingo-pink barge with the message: 'Just another day in paradigm.'

The restaurant was keeled over on Tuesday morning in the Ohio river, causing staff to rush to the site to secure it

The restaurant has been closed since 2011 after it came free of its dock on the Ohio River in Cincinnati causing diners to be rescued.

It broke free again in February and floated 85 feet before being stopped by a bridge. An employee was inside at the time, according to reports. 

Staff rushed to the tipping structure on Tuesday to secure it. No one was on board at the time it sank between Monday evening and Tuesday morning.

There had been plans by owner Mr Ruby to reopen the restaurant on dry land. 

Mr Ruby told Fox 19: 'It's sexy to dine on a floating restaurant, but it's not safe sex.'

There had been plans to reopen The Waterfront (pictured here before it sank) on dry land this year
