Tenderness in a long-term relationship is more important to middle-aged men than it is to women, according to a study.

Men in a committed relationship are also more likely to report being happy, while women are more likely to say they are satisfied with their sex lives, surprised researchers said.

For men, relationship happiness was more likely if the man reported being in good health and if it was important to him that his partner experienced orgasm.Â 

Together forever: Cuddling in a long-term relationship is more important to middle-aged men than it is to women, according to a study

Surprisingly, frequent kissing or cuddling also predicted happiness in the relationship for men, but not for women.

More than 1,000 couples who had been together an average 25 years were questioned about their private lives by scientists from the Kinsey Institute at Indiana University. The couples came from the U.S., Brazil, Germany, Japan and Spain.

Research to understand the place of sexuality in human lives rarely involves intact couples in ongoing relationships.

Lead researcher Julia Heiman said: 'It's important to note that though divorce rates are high in the U.S., couples tend to stay married - more than 50 per cent of U.S. couples remain in their first marriage, and that number goes up to 90 per cent in Spain.

'We know from other research that being in a long-term relationship has some value to health. Perhaps we can learn more about what makes relationships both sustainable and happy.'

Participants in the study were 40- to 70-year-old men and their female partners, either married or living together for a minimum of one year.

The study included around 200 couples from each country. The men and women answered gender-specific questionnaires and were assured that their responses would not be shared with their partner.

Dr Heiman said: 'This study on heterosexual couples provides a basis for future research on sex and gender, such as how same-sex couples may or may not show similarities and differences in relationship and sexual satisfaction.'

Both men and women reported more happiness the longer they had been together, and if they themselves scored higher on several sexual functioning questionnaires.

Across all five nationalities, for both men and women, the Japanese were significantly happier with their relationships than Americans, and Brazilians and Spanish reported less relationship happiness than Americans.

Men and women both were likely to report sexual satisfaction if they also reported frequent kissing and cuddling, sexual caressing by the partner, higher sexual functioning, and if they had sex more frequently.

On the other hand, for men, having had more sex partners in their lifetime was a predictor of less sexual satisfaction.

Men did report more relationship happiness in later years, whereas for women, their sexual satisfaction increased over time.

Women who had been with their partner for less than 15 years were less likely to report sexual satisfaction, but after 15 years, the percentage went up significantly.

'Possibly, women become more satisfied over time because their expectations change, or life changes with the children grown,' Dr Heiman said.

'On the other hand, those who weren't so happy sexually might not be married so long.'

Compared with the U.S. men, Japanese men reported they were 2.61 times more sexual satisfied in their relationships.

For women, Japanese and Brazilian women were more likely to report being satisfied sexually than Americans.

Dr Heiman said: 'We recognise that relationship satisfaction and sexual satisfaction may not be the same thing for all couples, and in all cultures.

'Our next step is to understand how one person's health, physical affection and sexual experiences relate to the relationship happiness or sexual satisfaction of his or her partner.

'So we hope for more couple-centred than individual-centred understanding on relationship functioning and satisfaction.'

The study is published in the journal Archives of Sexual Behavior.
