The family of a lost Second World War pilot whose plane was discovered in the desert 70 years after crashing feel 'let down' when they were told human remains found close by weren't his.

Relatives of Dennis Copping have been holding out hope that bones located three miles from the perfectly-preserved RAF plane in the Sahara are those of the airman.

But after months of waiting and receiving mixed messages from the Ministry of Defence, they have now been told that it is not possible to extract DNA from the remains.

The news has been met with frustration by Flight Sergeant Copping's nephew, John Pryor-Bennett, who had been about to fly to Egypt to provide a comparative DNA sample.

Scroll down to see the wreckage discovery scene:

Mysterious disappearance: Flight Sergeant Dennis Copping
crashed in the desert in 1942, and his plane was only uncovered last year

Mounting evidence: The twelve bones were found three miles found the plane, along with a piece of parachute, keyfob and metal button with 1939 on it

Bid for survival: The P40 Kittyhawk was found perfectly preserved and someone had apparently tried to build a shelter beside it

But the apparent inability to take DNA
 from the bones has been met with doubt by four forensic pathologists 
who have become involved in the case.

They now plan to travel to Cairo and 
examine the bones for themselves to give Mr Pryor-Bennett and his family
 a definitive answer.

After the bones were found last year, 
the family was initially told by the MoD that they were far too old to 
have been those of the lost airman.

It then emerged that this ruling was 
based on a flippant remark made by a member of the Egyptian authorities 
and the remains hadn't been examined at all.

Mr Pryor-Bennett, 62, was then invited to supply a DNA sample only for the bones to now be written off.

He and the forensic pathologists are 
demanding to know how authentic the tests have been up until now and 
more details about the circumstances of the examinations.

Mr Pryor-Bennett, from Kinsale, Cork, 
Ireland, said: 'I am a little bit appalled about how all of this has 
been handled. All the information that I have received since these bones
 were discovered last June has been misleading and vague.

'At first I was told the bones were 
400- years-old but information was on the back of a conversation about 
how more often than not bones in the desert were that age.

'Then it was arranged that I would fly
 to Cairo and give a DNA sample to the Egyptians so they could compare 
it with DNA from the bones.

'Now I have received a call from the 
MoD to say that the Egyptian authorities have done the tests and the 
bones aren't good enough to get a DNA profile from.

'I'm no expert but is it not possible 
to get DNA from a dinosaur bone? The people who found King Richard III 
were able to get a DNA sample from his bones and they were over 600 
years old.

Poignant: Flight Sergeant Denis Copping in his RAF uniform aged 24, just days before he went missing

Ready for combat: Flt Sgt Copping proudly looks down from the cockpit of his Kittyhawk P-40

'I am very disappointed with all of 
this and can't help feel let down. Dennis Copping was a serving his 
country and was out there doing his bit. If these remains are his he 
should be treated properly and given a proper burial.'

Ft Sgt Copping, 24, of the 260 
Squadron, had been flying a P40 Kittyhawk plane between two British 
bases in Egypt during the north Africa campaign when he disappeared.

Family memories: William Pryor-Bennett is the nephew of Flt Sgt Copping

Nothing was ever seen of him or his 
plane again until 12 months ago when a team of Polish oil exploration 
workers stumbled upon the perfectly-preserved aircraft.

There was evidence to suggest Ft Sgt 
Copping survived the crash as a makeshift shelter had been made using 
his parachute outside of the plane.

It is thought he died while making a futile attempt to walk out of the desert.

A month later a team of historians 
from Italy unearthed 12 human bones close to an outcrop of rocks about 
three miles from the plane.

A piece of torn parachute was found 
close to the remains along with a keychain fob with the number 61 on it.
 A metal button dated 1939 was also recovered nearby.

Dr Laurence Garey, an independent 
forensic anatomist who has worked at the University of Oxford and the 
University of Lausanne in Switzerland, is doubtful of the latest 
development.

He said: 'It is quite inconceivable and I cannot accept that is true.

'I have got DNA samples from bones far
 older than 70 years before. DNA has been extracted from 60 
million-year-old dinosaurs in the Oman desert before. I am one of four 
forensic pathologists hoping to go out there to find out the truth.'

A spokesman for the MoD said: 'The 
Egyptian medical research authorities have tested some bones and have 
come back and said it is not possible for a DNA sample to be extracted 
from them.

'We have informed Copping family accordingly.'

The last known whereabouts of the P40 Kittyhawk plane was in a storage crater in El Alemain.

The Royal Air Force Museum at Hendon 
has been in negotiations with the relevant Egyptian authorities to have 
the aircraft returned to Britain but it is not known how far that has 
progressed.

Sky sentinel: A Kittyhawk in U.S.Airforce colours in flight at Duxford Airfield in Cambridgeshire

Time capsule: Aside from the damage it sustained during impact, the aircraft appears to have been almost perfectly preserved in the sands of the Sahara

Chance discovery: The single-seater aircraft was found by a Polish oil company worker exploring a remote region of the western desert in Egypt

Intact: Most of the plane's cockpit instruments were untouched and it still had it guns and ammunition before they were seized by the Egyptian military for safety reasons

Second World War weaponry: The machine gun on the wing of the crashed plane. It appears the pilot got into trouble and brought it down in the middle of the desert

Bullet holes: The Kittyhawk appears to have been
 shot at (left), while its broken propeller lays nearby (right). 
Historians have described the find as the 'aviation equivalent of 
Tutankhamun's Tomb'

Well-preserved: The Kittyhawk's magazine of bullets were also found in the wreckage. The radio and batteries were discovered out of the plane

At the controls: The plane's cockpit, but there are fears over what will be left of it after locals began stripping parts and instruments for souvenirs and scrap

Unseen and untouched: Equipment and controls 
from the plane were found scattered around the craft at the crash site. 
The plane is still in very good condition

Heading home: The RAF Museum at Hendon, north London, has been made aware of the discovery and plans are underway to recover the aircraft for exhibition in the future

Sign of the time: The Kittyhawk's factory stamp 
(left) and gun loading instruction panel (right). However, some locals 
see the aircraft as a piece of junk

Signs of survival: Flight Sergeant Dennis Copping's parachute was part of what is believed to be a makeshift camp alongside the fuselage

Remote: The crash site is about 200 miles from the nearest town. No human remains have been found but it is thought the pilot's decomposed body may lay anywhere in a 20 mile radius of the plane

In flight: Ft Sgt Copping and another airman were tasked with flying two damaged Kittyhawk P-40 planes (like this one) from one British airbase in northern Egypt to another for repair
