Real Madrid left back Fabio Coentrao admits playing for Manchester United would be an honour as Louis van Gaal's side continue to be linked with a move for the 27-year-old.

Portuguese ace Coentrao, a good friend of former Red Devil Cristiano Ronaldo, has been linked with a move to Old Trafford time and time again, including in January 2014.

Current United left back Luke Shaw has failed to live up to the hype since his move from Southampton and Coentrao has admitted he has always admired the Manchester club should they come calling again.

Coentrao has again been linked with a move to Premier League giants Manchester United 

He told O Jogo: 'It's [Manchester United] one of the best clubs in the world, a club I admire greatly. It would be an honour to play there.'

However, the defender was quick to remind Real Madrid fans that he still has a lot to give the club during the four years that remain on his contract.

He added: 'I hope to have more minutes at Real Madrid, though the coach needs to trust me more, something that has not happened so far.'
