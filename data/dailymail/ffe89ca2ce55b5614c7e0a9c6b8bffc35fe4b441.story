Jeremy Clarkson has joined those paying tribute to the former MoS motoring editor

Jeremy Clarkson has joined those paying tribute to former Mail on Sunday motoring editor Frank Page, who has died aged 84.

Celebrated as one of the outstanding motoring journalists of his generation, Mr Page died last Saturday from septicemia, after being taken ill days earlier.

The motoring editor at The Mail on Sunday between 1982 and 1985, he was also a presenter of the BBC’s long-running series Top Gear from 1980 until 1990. He began his career in 1952 at Garage And Motor Agent magazine.

Current Top Gear presenter Clarkson tweeted: ‘Holy moly. Frank Page has died. My condolences to his family.’

Mr Page was a former chairman of the Guild of Motoring Writers.

The Guild said: ‘He was well-liked among his peers as great company and known for wide-ranging interests, particularly motorsport, the theatre and jazz.’

The father of three lived in Longtown, Herefordshire, with his wife of 44 years, Sam, who survives him.
