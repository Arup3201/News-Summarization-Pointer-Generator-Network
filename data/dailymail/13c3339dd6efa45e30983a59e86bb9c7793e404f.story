He may just be the hottest man on earth right now: at this very moment, women the world over are swooning at his long, tousled hair and chiselled bone structure.

But Ben Dahlhaus also has that little extra something that sets some men apart, taking them fromÂ  merely handsome to object of desire. In his case, it's his 'sad face'.

One particular image of the Swedish model looking into the camera lens with a furrowed brow and heartbreakingly sad, puppy dog eyes has sent his profile into the stratosphere.

Esra Sam took photos of Swedish male model Ben Dahlhaus doing a sad face, it soon went viral

An EliteDaily writer even used the caption 'his sad face is hotter than your hottest face' - and many agreed.

In the shot Ben purses his lips slightly as his long sunkissed hair falls to one side and the light hits a tanned, toned arm.

While his hipster credentials are obvious - beard, ear plugs - we think Ben works it in his own individual way.

Little
 is known about the handsome fellow aside from his name and country of 
residence, but the mystery makes him all the more fascinating.

Women of the web love his thick, wiry beard, tanned and toned bod and chiseled bone structure

Some of these images are for a campaign for Brathwait iconic slim wrist watches

He recently shot a campaign for luxury watchmaker Brathwait, including several lifestyle images and an artistic video clip.

Acclaimed photographer Esra Sam shot the campaign in the Monsieur Courbet area of Cologne, Germany.

Several international publications have since run 
articles on Ben's unique look and the campaign has gone viral.
