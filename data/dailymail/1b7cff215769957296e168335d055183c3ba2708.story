A tourist captured the moment a man saluted the Capitol before deciding to set himself alight on Washington’s National Mall on Friday,

Javier Soto was visiting the tourist hotspots with his camera snapping shots of the Smithsonian, the Washington Monument and the Lincoln Memorial. Then he went to see the Thomas Jefferson Memorial and the White House.

Finally, returning to the National Mall and, just before 4:30 p.m., he aimed his camera east, toward the Capitol and saw a man pouring gasoline over his body from a canister.

Mr Soto says the man gave the Capitol building  a crisp military salute, before igniting the fuel with a lighter

Clean up: Officials responded to the scene in minutes but apparently it was bystanders who were the first to help by taking off their shirts and trying to put the flames out themselves

Important place: The incident occurred in full view of the U.S. Capitol

Shutdown: The Capitol is on high alert in spite of the federal shutdown after a woman slammed her car into one of the barricades following a high-speed chase

Mr Soto kept shooting as flames engulfed the man.

‘I didn’t know what to do in that moment,’ Mr Soto, 39, said.

The
entire sequence of events lasted about a minute as other people arrived
and used their clothing to try and smother the flames.

The man died on Friday afternoon.
His burns were so severe that he has still not been identified, and 
authorities will have to use DNA and dental records to trace him.

Trouble in Washington: A man reportedly set himself on fire on the National Mall Friday afternoon

Police said he had been conscious and breathing when he was airlifted to MedStar Washington Hospital Center.

Possible
motives for the self-immolation are being investigated, but Lieutenant 
Pamela Smith said she was unaware that he carried any signs or had 
articulated a cause.

Witness
Katy Scheflen said she saw a tripod up near the man but that she did 
not hear him say anything intelligible before he set himself on fire.

It was also unclear if the man was filming the incident.

Some
reports say that two male bystanders initially tried to put the fire 
out using their own shirts while others put the number of Good 
Samaritans at closer to five or six people.

'I
didn't hear a word from him,' witness Adam Stifel told CNN. 'He had 
already doused himself with gasoline, I saw his gas can.'

Dangerous: The man in question was not identified and his motivation remains a mystery, though the very public nature of the incident hints that it could have been in protest to the government shutdown

The incident took place near the Air and Space Museum and although his motive is not known the chosen location hints that it was a demonstration.

The Mall is a national park, making it
one of the hundreds of such sites across the country that have been 
closed as a result of the government shutdown. 

U.S. Park Police sources told MailOnline that the shutdown didn't play into the rescue.

Response: Emergency crews were on the scene in minutes

Commotion: The fire incident came just one day after a woman was shot and killed by police after ramming her car into a White House barricade

'There is no indication that the government shutdown impacted the way anyone responded to this. DC Fire/EMS had people on the scene in, literally, three minutes, and a helicopter transport was there minutes later,' the source told MailOnline.

'We are the lead agency in this investigation, but it will be awhile before we give out details to anyone.'

The incident comes one day after a woman was killed by police after she rammed her car into a barricade leading to the White House.

Surrounded: Police officers surround the car with their weapons drawn after the female driver rammed a barricade close to the White House on Thursday
