Nicola Lewington, 24, of Mottingham, Bromley, south London spent the night behind bars while her daughter was home alone.

A mother arrested during August’s riots admitted leaving her two-year-old daughter alone overnight while she was held by police.

Nicola Lewington, 24, of Mottingham, Bromley, south London spent the night behind bars while her daughter was home alone.

Two-year-old Tiana was found the next day by Lewington’s mother when she visited the house to receive an Argos delivery.

Thea Viney, prosecuting, said: 'She could hear her whimpering and crying inside and went to collect her keys.

'She let herself in and found Tiana, who was two years old at the time, standing at the top of the stairs, crying, distressed, with a soiled nappy, asking for her mother.'

Lewington pleaded guilty to child neglect, though says she left her at home with a friend called Becky.

Bromley Magistrates’ Court heard Lewington had put Tiana to bed on August 9 and had gone out to buy a takeaway, leaving her friend Becky to look after her.

While she was out she met friends and drove to Orpington, where she was arrested with four other people at 1am after police found items they believed had been stolen during the riots in her car.

She was then taken to Bromley Police Station where she told officers she had a child but she was being looked after - but did not know Becky’s full name, phone number or where she lived.

Riots: Across the country protestors took to the streets last August. The riots saw buildings and vehicles set alight and shops looted as police in riot gear faced angry mobs

Ms Viney added: 'She left Tiana in the care of Becky and now accepts that led her to be reckless as to the child’s safety given how little she knew about who was caring for her.' 

James McCooey, mitigating, said: 'She was not a woman packing her bags and going on holiday.

'She would have been home if not for the fact she had been arrested.'

He added it was out of character and she had been described by friends as a 'very loving mother'. 

Magistrate Geraldine Mushett sentenced Lewington to an 18-month community order with a supervision requirement and she must take part in an intervention programme for women offenders, as well as pay costs of £85. 

Lewington was cleared of the burglary charges for which she was arrested on December 20.
