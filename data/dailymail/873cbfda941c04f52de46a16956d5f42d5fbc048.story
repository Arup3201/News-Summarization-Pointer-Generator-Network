Heart disease is on of the world's biggest killers - in 2012, an estimated 17.5 million people died worldwide, and numbers are steadily rising.

Efforts to battle heart disease continue, and scientists are painstakingly conducting research into everything from stem cell technology to the behaviour of blood flow in a bid to fight back.

To celebrate the British Heart Foundation's groundbreaking research, it held a photography competition showcasing the striking visuals that can come from biological imaging.

The clot thickens:  This image shows a blood clot in close detail. The thick grey mesh is the clot, capturing a mixture of different cells – seen in different colours. A BHF-funded researcher in the 1970s was the first to prove that clots can cause heart attacks

The overall winner of ‘Reflections of Research’ was an image of a blood clot that could easily be mistaken for a coral reef.

The incredible 'panoramic' is named 'The clot thickens' and displays what looks likes deep, dark caverns holding what look like tiny sea anemones. 

But these tiny 'creatures' are in fact an array of cells that have been caught up in the blood clot as it dries.

It was submitted by Fraser Macrae, a BHF-funded researcher based at the University of Leeds.

Indeed it was a BHF-funded researcher in the 1970s was the first to prove that clots can cause heart attacks. 

Seeing is believing: This image shows the intricate network of newly-formed blood vessels in the retina of a mouse eye. Understanding how blood vessels grow is an important part of understanding cardiovascular disease

Another finalist, named 'Scaffolding', was taken by Dr Anne Géraldine Guex, a BHF-funded researcher at Imperial College London.

For her research she uses scaffolds containing microscopic holes to grow healthy heart cells that could potentially be implanted into a patient’s damaged heart after a heart attack.

No smoke without fire: This picture is a blood vessel that doesn’t work properly and is leaking. The blood vessel is seen in red, with the leaks seen in grey. Maintaining healthy blood vessels is vital to prevent cardiovascular disease

Lifelines: Using the same computer modelling programmes that engineers use to design aeroplanes, scientists can now precisely model the blood flow in our blood vessels (pictured). These models can be used to design better techniques for dialysis, for example

The colourful 'Lifelines' was taken by Dr Francesco Iori, another BHF-funded researcher at Imperial College London.

Using the same computer modelling programmes that engineers use to design aeroplanes, he precisely models the flow in blood vessels. These models can be used to design better techniques for kidney dialysis that limit the disruption to a patient’s natural blood flow.

Made from stem cells: The banding seen in this microscopic view of heart muscle cells is vital for the contraction of the muscle that is needed for the heart to beat. Scientists can make heart cells from stem cells and study how changes in this banding cancause abnormal heartbeats

Another highly commended image was the striking 'Seeing is believing', by Dr Graeme Birdsey, a BHF-funded researcher in the Endothelial Homeostasis Group, NHLI Vascular Sciences at Imperial College London.

The image shows the intricate network of newly-formed blood vessels in the retina of a mouse eye. Understanding how blood vessels grow is an cart part of understanding cardiovascular disease.

'Heart cells made from stem cells' looks like it could be a close-up of a butterfly wing. It was taken by Dr James Smith, a  researcher at the University of Nottingham.

The banding seen in the microscopic view of heart muscle cells is vital for the contraction of the muscle so that the heart can beat. 

BHF-funded scientists can now make heart cells from stem cells and study how changes in this banding can lead to the heart not beating properly.

Scaffolding (pictured) containing microscopic holes are pictured here. They could help grow healthy heart cells that could potentially be implanted into a patient’s damaged heart after a heart attack

The bold No smoke without fire, was captured by Dr Neil Dufton, a researcher from the Endothelial Homeostasis Group, NHLI Vascular Sciences, Imperial College London

The image displays a blood vessel that doesn’t work properly and is leaking. The blood vessel is seen in red, with the leaks seen in grey. Maintaining healthy blood vessels is vital to prevent cardiovascular disease.
