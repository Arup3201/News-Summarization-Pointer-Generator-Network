Team news

Swansea

Jazz Richards could make his first Barclays Premier League start for nearly three years with Swansea having problems at right-back for the visit of Newcastle on Saturday.

Angel Rangel serves a one-match suspension after his red card at Sunderland last weekend and Dutch understudy Dwight Tiendalli is nursing a groin injury which has sidelined him since the end of August, so Richards stands by for his first top-flight start since Swansea's 1-1 draw with Tottenham in December 2011.

Wilfried Bony should return to lead the line with Bafetimbi Gomis dropping out from the goalless draw at Sunderland, but Jordi Amat (ankle) and Leon Britton (knee) are still absent.

Provisional squad: Fabianski, Richards, Fernandez, Williams, Taylor, Ki, Shelvey, Routledge, Dyer, Sigurdsson, Bony, Tremmel, Tiendalli, Bartley, Carroll, Emnes, Montero, Gomis, Fulton.

Newcastle

Newcastle boss Alan Pardew will assess striker Papiss Cisse's match fitness ahead of Saturday's Barclays Premier League trip to Swansea.

The Senegal international has been used as a substitute in each of the club's last two league games following his return from a fractured kneecap, but with goals at a premium, his manager would dearly love to have him at his disposal from the start.

Pardew otherwise has no fresh injury problems and while Ryan Taylor (cruciate ligament) played in a behind-closed-doors friendly in midweek, he, fellow defender Davide Santon (knee) and midfielders Siem de Jong (thigh) and Rolando Aarons (hamstring) remain on the comeback trail.

Provisional squad: Krul, Elliot, Janmaat, Dummett, Haidara, Coloccini, Williamson, S. Taylor, Tiote, Anita, Sissoko, Colback, Cabella, Gouffran, Obertan, Ameobi, Riviere, Cisse, Perez, Armstrong.
