Barcelona will not be allowed to sign players in 2015 after the Court of Arbitration for Sport upheld the FIFA sanction imposed on the Catalan club.

The ban was imposed on Barca after they were deemed to have breached rules on signing international players under the age of 18. 

Barca were appealing the ban at CAS headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland, this week but it was confirmed on Tuesday morning that it has been upheld and the Catalans will also be fined 450,000 Swiss Francs (£293,000). 

Luis Suarez's move to Barcelona was allowed while the club appealed against a ban on new signings, which is now in force after FIFA's original sanction was upheld by the Court of Arbitration for Sport on Tuesday

Thomas Vermaelen is one of five players to have moved to the Nou Camp this summer

Although they cannot make new signings they can renew contracts and recall on-loan players.

Barcelona were not happy with the decision and released a statement blasting CAS.

'FC Barcelona wishes to state, with all due respect for the sports authorities, that it totally disagrees with the verdict of the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) announced today to confirm the sanction originally imposed by FIFA as a consequence of the alleged breach of regulations on the international transfer of minor footballers.

'The club has made it clear to the FIFA Disciplinary Commission, the FIFA Appeals Commission and the CAS itself that it understands and supports the policy on the protection of minors and the concern for the protection of their development and education.

'This is confirmed by how they club has acted throughout its history, setting an example around the world for the way its young footballers are schooled and educated, and the work that is done on their development. FC Barcelona's youth structure has enabled hundreds of young players to achieve their dreams and receive a decent upbringing. 

Ivan Rakitic has also moved to Barcelona after their ban was delayed, but it is now in full force

'The errors that the club might have committed, and which have been recognised and argued before the corresponding authorities are, in all cases, of an administrative nature and to a large extent have been caused by the existing conflict between the FIFA regulations and Spanish legislation, along with the Club's conviction that it was acting correctly.

'Therefore, FC Barcelona considers the sanction to be completely disproportionate as it supposes an excessive punishment for the club, when considering its trajectory and the circumstances of this specific case.'

CAS had earlier released a statement saying: 'CAS has dismissed the appeal filed by FC Barcelona against FIFA regarding the decision issued by the FIFA Appeals Committee on August 19, 2014. 

Suarez is introduced to Barca fans in August after making his summer move from Liverpool 

'The panel found in particular that FC Barcelona had breached the rules regarding the protection of minors and the registration of minors attending football academies.

'The FIFA decision is confirmed in full and the sanction remains in force.' 

Barca's appeal to CAS forced a delay of the initial ban and allowed them to sign Luis Suarez, Ivan Rakitic and Thomas Vermaelen among others during the last summer transfer window.

But the CAS decision means the suspension will now be in effect during the January window and the summer spending period.

Barcelona will only be allowed to add to their squad from January 2016.

The Liga de Futbol Profesional (LFP) issued a statement later on Tuesday in which it expressed its concern that other Spanish clubs could find themselves in the same situation, and saying it may take the case to the European Union.

It also backed Barca's insistence that they had acted correctly throughout, and labelled the club's La Masia youth academy as 'a world example'.

'We consider that the sanction can only be classified as totally disproportionate, inappropriate and unrelated to the errors, since it involves a disproportionate punishment for FC Barcelona, taking into account the behaviour and the circumstances of the case,' a statement on www.lfp.es read.

'As a result of this existing conflict, to properly protect the interests of under-age players, the current model of Spanish football and the because other Spanish clubs can be found in a similar situation, the LFP is conducting a review of the adequacy of the different rules of FIFA, as well as the different standards of the European Union, and based on this will consider the possibility of reporting to the European Union the current regulation of the transfer of under-age players.'
