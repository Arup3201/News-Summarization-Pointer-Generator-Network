The first refreshed logo for Yahoo! in its 18 years was planned to the smallest, minute detail by CEO Marissa Mayer with her design team and comes after the Internet giant ran a month-long media campaign parading each rejected logo every day.

Designed to build up expectation for the unveiling in a month which will see the launch of the new iPhone 5S and the final episode of AMC's 'Breaking Bad', Yahoo! finally released their logo at midnight EDT.

Described by some tech-bloggers as having a 'parade of all the people you decided not to marry before your wedding', some of the designs have been praised, while others have been greeted with relief that Mayer did not plump for that particular one.

Day One: This was the first logo released by Yahoo to illustrate how they came to choose their new logo

This futuristic logo was rejected by Yahoo! and released as the 22nd (left) such discarded while on the right the 20th logo released was clearly never going to be used

Day 5: Yahoo! CEO wanted to create an air of anticipation around their new logo and this effort was released on August 5th

Day 10: Despite the choice of CEO Marissa Mayer and Yahoo! executives, the logo unveiled on day 10 proved to be the most popular

Indeed, Kara Swisher at All Things D had some acerbic words for the rejected logos, calling Day 20 'what happens when I let those kids of mine play on my computer and they screw up the fonts.'

While the new logo was apparently the best of the 29 options available to Mayer from her design team, the company still displayed the previous 29 online and asked the public to vote on them.

Polar, the photo imaging app that allows users to compare two photos and vote on them reveals that the most popular of the 30 logos, including the chosen one, was the 10th day of the project.

However, the new logo is not just an aesthetic change by Mayer.

This jazzy logo was the 21st unveiled by Yahoo! and came just 10 days before the internet giant revealed their choice

On the left is the 4th rejected logo that Yahoo considered using while on the right is the 3rd that bears some passing resemblance to the original one

Yahoo's 11th logo was reminiscent of Coca Cola's iconic logo that has been in use for over 100 years

Since taking over as CEO of the web giant in July 2012, she has made a remarkable number of changes to Yahoo! and its products, including updating Flickr and Yahoo.com.

Notably, Mayer has begun purchasing start-ups, including Tumblr for more than one billion dollars.

The redesigned look unveiled early this morning is part of a makeover that Yahoo has been undergoing since the Sunnyvale, California, company hired Google executive Marissa Mayer to become CEO 14 months ago.

She has already spruced up Yahoo's front page, email and Flickr photo-sharing service, as well as engineering a series of acquisitions aimed at attracting more traffic on mobile devices.

The shopping spree has been highlighted by Yahoo's $1.1billion (Â£720million) purchase of Tumblr, an Internet blogging service where the company rolled out its new logo.

The logo was shown in purple spelling out the word Yahoo!, with no letters touching and ending with an exclamation point.

'We wanted a logo that stayed true to our roots (whimsical, purple, with an exclamation point) yet embraced the evolution of our products' a statement on the website said.

In an effort to drum up more interest in the changeover, Yahoo spent the past 30 days showing some of the proposed logos that Ms Mayer and other executives cast aside.

The revision is the first time that Yahoo has made a significant change to its logo since a few tweaks shortly after co-founders Jerry Yang and David Filo incorporated the company in 1995.

Ms Mayer's overhaul of Yahoo has attracted a lot of attention, but so far it has not provided a significant lift to the company's revenue.

Yahoo depends on internet advertising to make most of its money, an area where the company's growth has been anaemic while more marketing cash flows to rivals such as Google and Facebook.

Yahoo's stock has climbed by nearly 80%, but most of that gain has been driven by the company's 24% stake in China's Alibaba Holdings Group.

Investors prize Alibaba because it has emerged as one of the fastest growing companies on the internet.
