A father of three who was cycling for charity was killed by a drunk teenage girl just moments before he crossed the finish line of a race.

Bethany Mackie, 18, yesterday admitted killing Christian Smith, who was raising money by cycling 248 miles between Kent and Sussex in just 24 hours.

On March 22, moments before he finished the race, the 38-year-old was struck by a car near Whitstable, Kent. Police said Mackie drove for another 400m before stopping.

Mackie, who was driving a blue Peugeot 206, was arrested at the scene and admitted causing death by dangerous driving and being at the wheel with excess alcohol in her system when she appeared at Canterbury Crown Court yesterday.

Since Mr Smith’s death, more than £82,000 has been donated to mental health charity Mind on his JustGiving page – breaking his original target of £1,000 by more than 8,000 per cent.

On his page, Mr Smith, from Boughton Aluph in Kent, spoke of his own mental health problems. 

He wrote: ‘I have had my own misfortune to suffer from a spate of poor mental health, which was unexpected and has been a real “game changer” in how I now view the future.

‘It has been a tough road to get to this point but I have been fortunate enough to have the support of my family and friends.'

Recent donors described Mr Smith as ‘kind’, ‘generous’ and ‘amazing’. One person wrote: ‘A great loss to his friends and family, but an inspiration to many’.

Inspector Martin Stevens from Kent Police said: ‘Christian Smith was a keen cyclist and was raising money for a cause close to his heart. His death, caused by this tragic and avoidable incident, is another reminder to everyone of the dangers of drink-driving.

‘Mackie will have to live with the consequences of her actions for the rest of her life. Her breath contained 73 microgrammes of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath, more than twice the limit. 

'Our message is that any amount of alcohol affects your ability to drive, so the only safe option is not to drink alcohol if you plan to drive.’

Mackie, from Herne Bay, Kent, was handed an interim driving ban. She has been released on bail until December 19 when she will be sentenced.  

Mackie was warned by Judge Adele WIlliams at Canterbury Crown Court, pictured, that jail was 'inevitable'
