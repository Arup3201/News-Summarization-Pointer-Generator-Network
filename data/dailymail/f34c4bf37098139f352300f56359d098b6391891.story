People living in certain parts of the UK are being forced to pay up to £170 million a year more for their broadband, due to a 'postcode lottery'.

New research from a broadband comparison site has revealed that in some cases, families are paying more than double what their neighbours are, despite living just 50 yards apart.

The study, the biggest ever of its kind, looked at more than 1.7 million postcodes covering 97 per cent of British households.

Research from Broadbandchoices.co.uk looked at 1.7 million postcodes and found that people in Greater Manchester and the West Midlands have the greatest choice of provider, price and speeds. Residents in Herefordshire and Rutland had the worst with some people paying £5 more than their neighbours

The study from Broadbandchoices.co.uk found speeds and prices often differ from street to street - sometimes within 50 yards - with postcode affecting choice of providers, deals and available speeds.

This system means 13 per cent of internet users are being penalised because they don't have access to cheaper deals - adding more than £60 to their yearly broadband connection bills.

Millions of broadband users are also suffering from reduced download speeds and limits.

In some areas customers can choose from 10 providers, while others have just five options.

This means that although some could pay as little as £2.99 per month for their broadband package, others are being forced to spend £8.15 or more.

The difference in availability doesn't
 only vary from county to county, some users in the same towns and even
 the same street can get better deals than their neighbours.

Those living on Bartons Place in 
Newmarket, Suffolk, for example, could find themselves paying over twice as much for 
their broadband than other houses less than 50 yards away - but getting 
just a third of the download speed of their neighbours.

Residents of Scarrowhill Road, Hornsby Gate, Cumbria, pay an extra £5 per month as well as receiving slower download speeds and having two fewer providers to pick from compared to neighbours just half a mile away on the same street.

The survey also reveals a north south divide in the number of providers.

Those in the South have an average of 10 while those in the North of England have a pool of 11 to choose from.

Herefordshire has the worst overall broadband choice where users have the narrowest choice of providers - at an average of eight.

The county also has the slowest advertised download speeds of just 12.3Mbps and pay the second highest minimum costs in the country of £5.47, second only to Rutland residents who have to pay a minimum of £5.99 a month.

Greater Manchester topped the study with the lowest broadband costs at just £2.99 per month, average advertised download speeds of up to 28Mbps and an average choice of 12 providers.

Those in the South can take some solace in the fact they just nudge the North when it comes to average advertised download speeds with 22Mbps compared to 21Mbps.

The difference in download speeds between counties ranges from 8.5Mbps to 40Mbps, meaning a two-hour HD film takes as little as 10 minutes (at 40Mbps) to download, whilst for others it will take nearly an hour.

Dominic Baliszewski, of broadbandchoices.co.uk, said: 'Broadband has become an essential utility for people in the UK and it's madness that in 2013 people are being penalised simply due to where they live.

'The Government has a responsibility along with providers to ensure a consistent standard of broadband service for every household in the UK.

Residents living at one end of Scarrowhill Road, Hornsby Gate in Cumbria, pictured, pay an extra £5 per month, get slower download speeds and have two fewer providers to choose from compared to neighbours just half a mile away at the other end of the street

'However, with the recent announcement that the Government will now roll out superfast services to 95 per cent of homes by 2017, it seems the goalposts are being repeatedly pushed back.

'Most customers will not even be aware that they are at a digital disadvantage. These discrepancies in speed and price occur when different broadband providers install their technology in different exchanges located around the country.

'If your local exchange has been 'enabled' by lot of different providers, you will have a great selection of broadband services to choose from. However, if you only have a handful of providers enabled at your local exchange, your choice will be extremely limited.'

He added: 'Strong broadband competition is vital to ensuring that customers get the best possible service at the best possible price, but even if you live in an area with limited options you should still regularly shop around.'
