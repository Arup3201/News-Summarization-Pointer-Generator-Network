Siem de Jong will be invited into John Carver’s backroom team at Newcastle with the forward almost certain to miss the rest of the season following surgery on a collapsed lung.

The Magpies have backtracked on their initial estimate that the 26-year-old would be missing for eight weeks.

Instead, it now appears likely that De Jong will only make a return to competitive action next season after Carver admitted there was no timescale on his recovery.

Siem de Jong has only played two Premier League games for Newcastle since joining from Ajax

The former Ajax captain will visit United’s training ground for the first time on Friday following last week’s operation.

And Carver will ask De Jong to play a behind-the-scenes role during his rehabilitation.

He explained: ‘We did something similar with Ryan Taylor when he was injured and he did some scouting. But with Siem I might ask him to come in and watch the Under-21s or the youth team and give me some feedback.

‘I want to make him feel part of the club because I think he's a little bit frustrated.’

De Jong’s frustration comes from a series of injuries which have limited his Premier League starts this season to just one.

He picked up a calf problem in pre-season and suffered a torn thigh muscle in September. The £6million summer signing was due to make his comeback at Crystal Palace last week when he was diagnosed with a collapsed lung for the second time.

And Carver added: ‘He's come here with a big reputation and he's not been able to get on the pitch and give something to the fans.

‘He got so close and then it's like chopping his legs away. So if can use him around the place I'd be mad not to.’

De Jong first suffered a collapsed lung at the beginning of last season with Ajax but his recent surgery is thought to have corrected the weakness, although it is not known when he will be strong enough to resume training.

‘I haven’t put a timeline on his return,’ said Carver. ‘The most important thing is how he feels. This was a big operation he had. So it’s really in his hands. We won’t force him before he is ready to come back.

‘But he’s such a positive guy he might be back quicker than anyone expects.’

Meanwhile, Newcastle will learn on Friday if midfielder Cheick Tiote’s season is over.

He picked up a knee injury playing for Ivory Coast during the Africa Cup of Nations and it is feared he will miss the remainder of the campaign.

United are not happy that their player has returned with a injury and could now take further action if tests reveal serious damage.
