It is a sight to make every man around the world wince in sympathy.

A Chinese builder was left in agony when he impaled his genitals on a steel rod.

Wu Hsing, 40, had reportedly tried to jump between two beams at a building site in the city of Zhangzhou in south-eastern China's Fujian province.

But as he leapt from one to the other he slipped, plunging more than 6ft to the ground and landing crotch-first on the 7ft steel rod, reported People's Daily Online.

Wu Hsing, 40, had to be rescued by firefighters after impaling his genitals on a steel rod, leaving the porr builder bloodied and pale with pain

Work pal Cheng Ni, 38, said: 'He was showing off his balancing skills and was doing a pretty good job until he missed his footing and slipped.

'When he landed, he let out a howl of such pain I thought the steel rod had gone right inside. Mind you what had happened was bad enough.

'I looked down and saw him sitting on the ground with this huge pole sticking out of his trousers.

'There was a lot of blood and he was very pale, sitting and staring at it.'

When an ambulance arrived, paramedics sawed off the top and bottom of the steel rod before rushing Wu to hospital where surgeons were able to remove the rest.

A hospital spokesman said: 'It was a very tricky operation as the rod had mangled his genital area. 

'We had to make sure we didn't make the situation worse.

'It is too early to say if he will regain use of his reproductive organs but in the first instance he is incredibly lucky that the bar only penetrated there and didn't go through his body, or pierce his neck. 

'It was long enough that it could have come out through his head.'

The man is now recovering in hospital.
