Shinji Kagawa was seen striking a few unusual poses during a training session with Japan ahead of the 2014 World Cup in Brazil.

Whether the Manchester United playmaker was using some new fangled training techniques that are yet to reach Roy Hodgson's antiquated camp orÂ simply messing about is not certain.

The 25-year-old was pictured balancing on a so-called Bosu Ball as if it were a raft while appearing to use a weights bar for an oar - or perhaps he was practicing for the world's smallest pole vault.

At a stretch: Kagawa is put through his paces during the training session in Tokyo

Kagawa was one of 12 Europe-based players to be selected for Alberto Zaccheroni's 23-man squad for Brazil, despite another underwhelming season at Old Trafford.

Kagawa was caught mid-flight when the squad was announced, with a cabin crew member breaking the news.

'It
 wasn't announced on the plane, a regular cabin attendant gave me the 
message,' he was quoted by Kyodo after landing in Tokyo on Monday.

'Quite simply I am relieved. But being a member of the team is not my goal. My aim is to deliver results.'

Japan will play warm up games against Cyprus (27 May) and Zambia (6th June) before heading to Brazil where they have been drawn in a group with Ivory Coast, Greece and Columbia.
