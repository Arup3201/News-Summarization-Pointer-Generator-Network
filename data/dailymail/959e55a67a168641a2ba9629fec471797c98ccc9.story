Shane Kelly, 10, ran away from home because he wanted to play computer games - sparking an £8,000 police search  - before he was found in his shed

A 10-year-old boy sparked a huge police search involving a helicopter and almost 20 officers after he ran off because he wanted to play computer games, before he was found hiding in the garden shed of his home 12 hours later.

Shane Kelly ran away from his mother and their home in Tyseley, Birmingham, after she told him he had to go to school instead of playing computer games. 

His disappearance led to widespread panic as 17 officers were deployed to search streets and even began looking in rubbish bins to find the child. 

Messages were sent out on Twitter to try and locate the boy while members of the community also helped with the search. 

Around 17 police officers were involved  and the West Midlands police helicopter - which costs about £700 an hour - was deployed.

The child was found around 12 hours later sitting in the garden shed of his home. The police operation to find him is believed to have cost £8,000. 

His mother, Jackie Burke, 36, said: 'He was hiding in the shed in the garden.

'I don't know how he managed to avoid the police, he must have gone from shed to shed.

'I'm just so relieved he was found. A family member found him while I was at Stechford police station worried sick.

'He ran off because he was rebelling about going to school. He wanted to stay at home and play computer games.

'But he is not in any trouble, I love him.' 

The 10-year-old  ran away from his mother as they walked to nearby Holy Souls Catholic Primary School at about 9.20am on Friday.

'He had been off for two days as he hadn't been very well, he complained that he had a bad stomach,' added Ms Burke. 

'I said he had to go in to school and he was shouting back at me. As we got to the end of the road he ran off. 

Members of the community and the police helicopter were involved in the search for the missing 10-year-old 

Shane disappeared from his family home in Tyseley but was found hiding in the garden shed 12 hours later 

'His dad lives across the road so I thought he was going there, but he carried on running.'

After his disappearance residents were so worried that a group met at Tyseley Working Men's Club to join the search as night fell.

It was not until shortly after 9pm, following the widespread police search, that Shane was eventually found.

A West Midlands Police spokesman tweeted on Friday: 'Shane has just been found. He's home and being checked over. Great news and a huge relief.'

'Thank you to absolutely everyone who has helped us in our search for the missing ten-year-old from Tyseley today.'
