Whether rugby, cricket, rowing or even fencing, it seems there's a sport for everyone at Oxford University.

But even the completely unfit can enjoy the latest addition to the University's sporting scene - a nude calendar featuring brave students.

70 elite sportsmen and women have stripped off for the Blues Charity Naked Calendar 2014, their modesty kept intact only by strategically placed bats, balls, racquets, helmets and oars.

The calendar, which was photographed and produced by students, has already gone on sale and proceeds from the £10 cover price will be shared between two charities in the city including its food bank and two international education charities.

The A4 calendar which opens to A3 comes ready to hang and boasts a large date grid 'allowing plenty of space for writing all your engagements.'

The calendar states: 'The Full Monty - Each Participant in this calendar has represented the university in their sport while a full time Oxford Student and has given their time to help raise money for these excellent causes.'

The black and white shots were taken around the historic college buildings and on sports pitches at the university.

Teams that feature in the calendar include the hunky rugby boys, the hockey team facing off with their hockey sticks, fencers fighting in a stairwell and the the rowing team posed in their boathouse with a carefully placed bottle of champagne.

Also included is the cricket team who stand ready to catch a ball, the swimmers and the polo team with helmets covering each student’s modesty

Student Grace Segall, a member of the fencing team who appears in the February photograph, said: 'It was a little bit nerve-wracking, we all had butterflies. But we were only exposed for a short time. It was tasteful.'

The 19-year-old, who is about to start her second year studying biochemistry at University College added: 'I think it is really good and I am really impressed with some of the motion pictures, such as diving. There is a good mix of sports in the calendar.'

Rebecca Bibb, a third year materials science undergraduate and tennis Blue, said: 'I did the calendar because it is an entertaining and unusual way of raising money for charity.

'The calendar features four men's, four women's and four mixed photos, taken by photographer and Oxford student Toby Mather.'

Louis Geary, Oxford University’s RAG events vice-president, said: 'Naked calendars aren’t themselves a new funraising idea but they tend to appeal to just a small target market.'

The RAG is the charity arm of the students union and last year raised around £100,000 for good causes.

Cash raised this year will be split between charities that students have voted to support and which include The Oxford Food Bank, Education Partnerships Africa, Students Supporting Street Kids, and the Oxford arm of Giving What We Can.
