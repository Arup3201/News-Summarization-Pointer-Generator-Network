David Coulthard has urged McLaren to retain Jenson Button with the British driver’s Formula One future hanging in limbo.

McLaren will discuss their line-up for next season at a board meeting on Thursday and it is likely that Button will make way for Fernando Alonso who re-joins the team from Ferrari.

The Spaniard is set to be partnered with the more affordable Kevin Magnussen, who managed less than half of Button’s points tally this season, or the team’s even younger protege Stoffel Vandoorne.

Jenson Button speaks to Red Bull driver Daniel Ricciardo before the final race of the season in Abu Dhabi, with the Brit's Formula One future hanging in the balance following the arrival of Fernando Alonso at McLaren

‘If you just look at results then Jenson is the guy who should be in that seat next year’, said Coulthard, who spent nine seasons with McLaren.

‘He has outperformed and outscored his team-mate and that has nothing to do with personality or his nationality. But unfortunately for Jenson, the business of Formula One is what funds the sport so he may well be a casualty.’

Alonso’s move back to the team he left so acrimoniously in 2007 is expected to net him £25million-a-year. Button currently earns about £13m against Magnussen’s £500,000.

‘I don’t know this for a fact, but there are all sorts of behind-the-scenes shareholding wrangling which is all about funding,’ added Coulthard.

Alonso has rejoined McLaren for the 2015 season and is likely to be partnered by Kevin Magnussen, Button or rookie Stoffel Vandoorne

‘I believe some of the partners already involved with McLaren are Danish companies so they are going to be supportive of Kevin.

‘He is a nice lad and has a bright future ahead of him, but Jenson has got a lot of public support. He is a well-known, recognisable, likeable face, an asset to Formula One and to McLaren.’

Button will end a 15-year career if he is not retained by McLaren, and the Briton has already explored options outside of the sport, most notably the World Endurance Championship.

But McLaren’s failure to determine his future before the season finale and thus depriving Button, the 2009 world champion, an opportunity of a public farewell in Abu Dhabi, has attracted widespread criticism.

‘McLaren are in a public sport and the heroes of the sport are the drivers,’ said Coulthard, a 13-time race winner.

‘They are still the ones that get the public support because they humanise the raw dream of being able to drive a grand prix car. With that in mind I can’t help but think it hasn’t been McLaren’s best year of PR.

‘The occasion of life and sport is that it is not like Jenson can come back in Melbourne and blow everyone a kiss. We have all moved on.

‘It would be easy to drop a one liner and say it is not right, but if you are a rational individual then you have to look at the bigger picture.

‘Did he deserve to be treated with a little bit more respect given his time in the sport? Yes, I certainly think that is a valid argument.’
