Newsnight's viewers accused the BBC of 'new depths of dumbing down' last night after it interviewed the Great British Bake Off contestant forced off the show when his Baked Alaska collapsed. 

Presenter Kirsty Wark and baker Iain Watters both wore aprons in the three minute segment as they discussed the scandal and ate some of the 31-year-old's best cakes.

The bearded baker lost his cool when his ice cream filled pudding melted after rival contestant Diana Beard took it out of the freezer - leading Mr Watters to throw it in the bin.

The controversy whipped up anger among viewers who accused Mrs Beard, 69, of sabotaging the pudding, and led to Watters' his exit from the show.

But furious Newsnight fans rushed to criticise the decision to feature the story on the BBC's flagship current affairs show and said standards have slipped since Jeremy Paxman left this summer.

Controversial: The melting of Iain Watters' Baked Alaska enthralled millions of Bake Off fans this week but Newsnight viewers turned on the show and said it should never have been featured

Critique: People took to Twitter the highlight the 'dumbing down' of the BBC's flagship news show

Yesterday the BBC's former editorial boss Peter Mosey said the programme’s under-fire editor Ian Katz is struggling to recover from the departure of its main presenter in June.

Paxman's own parting shot after 25 years at the helm was that the show was 'made by 13-year-olds'  and its producers were 'idealists' on a 'fool’s errand'.

Newsnight's has lost five per cent of its viewers in the past year. 

Ian Francis ‏tweeted: 'How many additional viewers has #Newsnight put on since it began dumbing down. Last night featured 'interview' with Bake Off contestant!

Bryan Robson tweeted: 'So Russia's invading Ukraine, our own country could split within the month, and are interviewing the bloke from the Bake Off.

Tom Jamieson ‏said: 'Iain from Bake Off on Newsnight, whilst over on Chatty Man Alan Carr is discussing the Ukrainian invasion with the Russian Foreign Minister.

@NickMotown tweeted: 'Ian (sic) from Bake Off is on Newsnight tonight. How I wish Paxman were still there. His contempt, harnessed, could power a small African village'.

Ben Dirs said: Newsnight doing a segment on a Great British Bake Off controversy - I imagine Jeremy Paxman crying and laughing while stabbing a sponge cake. 

He added: 'Kirsty Wark: "How many people died in Libya today?! Blimey. Wow. Anyway, have you edited that segment on the baked alaska yet?" 

Criticisms: Viewers and experts have said that Newsnight has struggled 

Tom Wilson ‏wrote: 'Newsnight, the gritty, hard hitting news show covering Great British Bake Off Baked Alaska controversies'.

Edd Kimber said: '#bingate is being featured in tonight's Newsnight?! Bake Off is still about cake right? Didn't change to politics did it?' 

Away from Newsnight the melting of Iain Watters' Baked Alaska has enthralled fans.

Great British Bake Off contestant Diana Beard has revealed she left the show but not because of the ice cream pudding controversy, because she lost her sense of smell and taste when she fainted.

But Mrs Beard, 69, said she wept as she claimed the corporation had cast her as the villain, deliberately editing the show to make it look as if she had left the dessert out of the freezer for several minutes. 

The scandal is the biggest to hit Bake Off since last year’s Custardgate drama, when one contestant tearfully admitted taking another’s custard to use in a trifle.

Getting to the soggy bottom of the baked Alaska incident, however, was proving rather more difficult last night.

Popular: The Bake Off had more than eight million viewers on Wednesday night - but the 590,000 who watch Newsnight were less interested

The story starts on Wednesday when 8million viewers watched bearded Iain Watters, 31, throw a wobbly when he found his dessert had been reduced to a splodge after Mrs Beard took it out of the freezer.

He was eliminated after he presented it in a bin to judges Mary Berry and Paul Hollywood, then stormed off set.

That led to Mrs Beard, from Shropshire, being pilloried as a cheat in cruel online comments. There were more than 550 complaints to the BBC.

She, however, insisted the recording had been edited to make it seem as if she had left the meringue and ice cream dessert out for minutes, rather than seconds. ‘They deliberately misled viewers and exploited me for the sake of entertainment,’ she said. ‘The BBC should be ashamed.

‘The cake was out of the freezer for 40 seconds and I was asking who it belonged to. Then Iain walked over and took it away. It happened as simply as that.

‘Iain didn’t blame me at all. I was very disappointed and upset by how they cleverly edited the show and as a result I have people saying all sorts of nasty things about me.’

A BBC spokesman said: 'The "Bingate" saga was a much talked about episode, leading to a huge audience reaction and prominent coverage across national newspapers and online, including the Mail.

'Newsnight approached Iain Watters directly to secure his first interview about what happened behind the scenes and subsequently since filming which gave our audiences an exclusive slice of the action.'

Newsnight has been suffering falling viewing figures and increased criticism about its tone by viewers.

Last night it was its feature with a failed Bake Off contestant but last week it was a row about whether it had played into the hands of terrorists when it carried an interview with an Islamic State fanatic.

The programme also got into hot water recently following its aborted investigation into Jimmy Savile and false accusations it made against Lord McAlpine, where he was wrongly accused of being a paedophile.

It was also ridiculed when Kirsty Wark did Michael Jackson's Thriller routine on Halloween.  

Argument: Ian Katz said that Kirsty Wark's Thriller last year was not a signal of dumbing down

Former BBC boss Roger Mosey yesterday slammed the flagship current affairs show for trying to chase ratings rather than focus on ‘intelligent viewers’.

He believes the show hasn’t recovered from losing Jeremy Paxman’s ‘sense of theatre’, 

Writing in the New Statesman, he said: ‘It’s possibly because of the grimness of the news agenda that I find myself ending the day with BBC2’s Newsnight less often than I used to. I admire the energy that Ian Katz has brought to the role of editor, but there’s a sense he could be flogging a dying horse.’

Defence: Under fire editor Ian Katz says the show is more serious than at any time in its recent past 

Before leaving Newsnight in June, Paxman, 64, admitted he sometimes felt like telling viewers to ‘go to bed’ because the programme had so little of value to say on slow news days.

Since Paxman left, ratings have in fact risen by 17,000, but still lag far behind the audiences it attracted ten years ago.

The show has endured a torrid couple of years in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal, after it emerged it had investigated the disgraced DJ’s paedophilic past but failed to air its findings before his death.

The following year, Newsnight came under further pressure when it wrongly identified former Tory treasurer Lord McAlpine as a paedophile, prompting a £185,000 payout for damages.

But Mr Katz has persistently denied he has been dumbing down the show after he took over the BBC's flagship current affairs show.

Newsnight has since hit the headlines thanks to Paxman's interview with Russell Brand, Kirsty Wark dancing to Thriller and Emily Maitlis "interviewing" Cookie Monster.

But Mr Katz told the Radio Times last year: 'Any suggestion of dumbing down is painfully preposterous. Newsnight is more serious than at any time in its recent past.

'The audience is improving from 605,000 in 2013 to routinely more than 700,000 and between 400,000 and 600,000 on Thursday when we compete with Question Time. But we were knocking on a million when Jeremy interviewed Russell Brand. That's a new and exciting way to do politics.'

According to Broadcast magazine: 'Newsnight has recorded an average consolidated audience of 590,100 (3.98%) from 2 September 2013 (Katz’s first episode) to 30 April 2014, compared with 623,300 (4.05%) over the same period in 2012/13'.
