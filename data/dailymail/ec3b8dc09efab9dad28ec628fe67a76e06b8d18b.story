Crawling though a muddy trench under barbed wire, clambering over obstacle courses and running in the sweltering heat - it's all in a day's work for this U.S. Naval Academy freshman class.

The entire class, known as Plebes, embarked on a 14-hour day of physical and mental challenges known as Sea Trials, starting at 3am on Tuesday.

The endurance challenge caps off their first year at the academy in Annapolis, Maryland.

Heat and humidity only make the day more rigorous - to fight off cramps, some carry bottles of mustard in their pockets.

The trials test the freshmen cadets' teamwork and endurance, while bringing them closer together.

Sea Trials are modeled after the Marine Corps' Crucible and the Navy's Battle Stations recruit programs, according to the U.S. Navy.
