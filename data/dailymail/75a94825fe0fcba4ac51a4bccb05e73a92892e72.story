Margaret Thatcher’s government considered redrawing the Irish border to move thousands of Catholics into the Republic, but abandoned the idea on human rights grounds.

The extraordinary plan to move part of Belfast from Northern Ireland to the Republic emerged in files from 1984 just released by the National Archive.

The plan - which was studied by Mrs Thatcher personally – would have cut Northern Ireland in half and created a ‘walled ghetto’ in west Belfast.

The idea was put forward by the Northern Ireland Office, based on a paper by Paul Compton, an academic from Queen's University Belfast.

Unionists would have been compensated for giving up their homes and businesses to the Republic.

But the Thatcher government concluded that while it might have been acceptable for a totalitarian regime, human rights arguments would be an obstacle, the Irish Independent reported.

The fact that the idea reached the desk of the British prime minister reflects the desperation of the government to find a way to end the troubles.

The newly-released files reveal details of several secret meetings between the UK and Irish governments.

After the IRA bombed the Conservative party conference in Brighton in October 1984, Mrs Thatcher called for the talks to be slowed down to avoid the impression that she was ‘being bombed into making concession to the Republic’.

Irish Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald was opposed the idea of partitioning part of Northern Ireland, because it would create a permanent division on the island, Margaret Thatcher said

The idea of redrawing the Irish border to move Catholics into the Republic was one of the most extreme to be considered by ministers.

Incentives would be offered to ‘drive out large numbers’, officials from the Northern Ireland Office suggested.

Mr Compton’s study was described as a ‘most respected analysis by the NIO. A copy of it was sent to Mrs Thatcher who added notes and heavily underlined the files.

Dr Compton suggested three options for repartition. It included one which would have seen more than half of Northern Ireland to the Republic, cutting its population to one million, three-quarters of which would have been Protestant.

Under a less extreme option parts of Fermanagh, south Armagh and most of Derry city would have been ceded, cutting the Catholic population by 105,000 to around 460,000. Around 30,000 Protestants would have been transferred to the Republic.

Officials also discussed Dr Compton's idea of slicing up Belfast itself, creating ‘a wedge-shaped area in west Belfast’ running from Twinbrook to the Divis Flats, including areas such as Poleglass, Andersonstown and the Lower Falls.

The briefing paper discussed ‘difficulties over the Belfast sector’.

It warned that the idea of a ‘walled ghetto’ would involve ‘physical as well as political difficulties’.

It adds: ‘Policing international boundaries across Belfast and any corridor between republican Belfast and the Border would be a formidable task.’
