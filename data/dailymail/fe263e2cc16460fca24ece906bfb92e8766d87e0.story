As a celebrity-obsessed culture, there is immense pressure on women to look good and females are forced to compare themselves to stars with perfect bodies.

A flabby stomach was the biggest concern for both men and women - with three quarters admitting they are carrying 2lbs of unwanted fat

But it has now been revealed that seven in ten women are so anxious about the way they look they fret about their weight three times a day, with a staggering 80 per cent of Brits saying they're depressed by the appearance of their own body.

The study found actress Cameron Diaz's legs, reality star Kim Kardashian's bottom, model Gisele Bundchen's flat stomach and singer Jessica Simpson's bust are considered to be 'ideal'.

And the desire to look the same appears to be having a serious impact on the way women look at themselves.

But it's not just women who are concerned about piling on the pounds.

The research by hotel chain Travelodge also revealed 61 per cent of men fret about their body three times a day.

Many
 desired athletic legs like David Beckham, the bottom of heartthrob 
actor Channing Tatum and the abs like Mark Wahlberg and Matthew 
McConaughey.

A flabby stomach was the biggest 
concern for both men and women - with three quarters admitting they are 
carrying 2lbs of unwanted fat.

Legs were the second biggest worry for women, followed by their bottoms, arms and hips.

And
 eight out of ten said their lives would improve considerably if they 
felt happy about their body, with over a third saying it would boost 
their sex drive.

The second biggest concern for men was their arms, followed by shoulders, legs and bottoms.

Travelodge spokeswoman Shakila Ahmed said: "We are living in a celebrity obsessed culture where image is everything.

Cameron Diaz has the ideal legs, according to the study

Gisele Bundchen's flat stomach has women green with envy

Kim Kardashian has the bottom that women rival

'And now more women and men are feeling more self conscious about their appearance.

'Stars like Cameron Diaz and Kim Kardashian as well David Beckham are thought to have the "perfect" figure.

'Many Brits feel the pressure to look just as good and it's having a huge impact on their lives.

'It's staggering that such a large proportion of men and women find themselves worrying about their weight every day.

'And it's worrying that as many as 80 per cent are actually depressed by the appearance of their bodies.'

Research also found 57 per cent of Brits find it hard to exercise while away from home.

And a further 40 per cent said a break means they struggle to resume their fitness regimes once they return home.

Most of us don't have the luxury of have a portable personal trainer with us like the celebrities do when they are on-the-go or traveling abroad.

And in light of the news, Travelodge has created a free room workout for guests, which can be done without specialist equipment.

The regime, put together by personal trainer Marko Mandic, includes lunges as well as press-ups, abdominals, squats and a variety of stretches.

Miss Ahmed added: 'Our customer feedback and research findings has highlighted Britons want to maintain their fitness regime when away from home.

'We have produced a room workout which requires no equipment but gives optimum results.'

Mr Mandic added: 'The workout targets large muscle groups which is great for overall strength and muscle toning.

'More lean muscle boosts the metabolism, which in turn means more calories are being burnt.

'Perform these exercises properly, regularly and safely and you will see excellent results.'
