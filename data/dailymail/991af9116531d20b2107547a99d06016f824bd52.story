Mechanics have created the world's longest Mini Cooper limousine - and it is almost as long as a double-decker bus.

The 27ft six-wheeler British classic began life as a humble Mini Cooper S before being flown to Las Vegas for a £65,000 makeover.

Specialists cut chopped the car in half and added an extra 16ft of space.

The six-wheeler vehicle is believed to be the longest Mini Cooper limousine in the world

The black and white limo seats six people
 in ultimate luxury, and according to owner Kamran Akram it has become 
his company's biggest head turner.

Mr Akram, who owns Krystal Limousines, in Coventry, West Midlands, said: 'People, and especially children, go crazy for the car every time it drives past them in public - they take pictures, come over for a chat and get really excited.

Length: 27ft

Engine: Standard 1.6litre Cooper S engine

Top speed: 100mph

Weight: Estimated there tonnes

Cost of hire: £200 per hour

'As far as I'm aware it's the world's longest Mini limo - and that's something we're extremely proud of.

'It's certainly an eye-catching car and a lot of people are now choosing it for special occasions over the more common limos. 

'And no wonder because it's absolutely bizarre - the Italian Job gone mad.'

The businessman, 40, came up with the idea of the Mini limo after discovering a bespoke modification garage in the U.S.

And after insisting the adapted car must represent the UK, he settled on the iconic 1960s Mini.

Mr Akram shipped the factory version Mini Cooper S over to Las Vegas, where mechanics took to building the bizarre car.

It can comfortably fit six people in the back and owner Kamran Akram said it is hired for proms and weddings

They
 also transformed the interior into a luxury lair for revellers - 
including disco ball, champagne fridge, TVs and DVD players, neon 
lights, blacked out windows and state-of-the-art music system.

It is kitted out with leather interior and curved seating, which face a fully-stocked alcoholic bar to get the night started.

Despite being the size of three Minis, the car can still reach speeds of more than 100mph.

Mr Akram said: 'There really isn't anything else like it around. When we were designing it there really wasn't any other car we'd choose.

'The Mini is a British classic - it is recognised around the world. Now we have the longest one on the planet.'

The four-year-old limo comes with its very own chauffeur to carry passengers anywhere they wish.

Mr Akram said customers are 'choosing it for special occasions over the more common limos.'
