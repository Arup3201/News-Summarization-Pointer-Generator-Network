Plans for a new airport in the Thames estuary have won political backing from senior figures close to David Cameron.

Steve Hilton, the Prime Minister’s strategy chief, and Chancellor George Osborne are said to have swung behind the scheme as the best way of tackling a crisis in airport capacity.

Big sell: The Thames Hub will have a high speed railway station under it running across the UK and into Europe

In July, The Mail on Sunday revealed Mr Hilton had joined forces with London Mayor Boris Johnson to persuade Mr Cameron to drop his opposition to plans for an airport off the Isle of Sheppey in Kent, nicknamed ‘Boris Island’.

Now senior Government sources have confirmed that although no formal discussions have been held, support for the £40 billion hub – which would replace Heathrow  as the UK’s largest airport – is gathering pace.

A separate £50 billion Thames airport scheme has been drawn up by architect Lord Foster for the nearby Isle of Grain in Kent.

Until recently, the Isle of Sheppey idea was viewed as a bizarre plan backed only by Mr Johnson but now the Chancellor is said to have warmed to the idea.

Support: Norman Foster designed the new Wembley Stadium, and he is looking to create something similarly distinctive at the Thames Hub - with new Transport Secretary Justine Greening thought to be an ally

Philip Hammond, who did not back the scheme, was last month replaced as Transport Secretary by Justine Greening, who is seen as an ally of the project. She previously campaigned against expansion at Heathrow.

Mr Johnson is due to launch a policy paper tomorrow calling for more runways to be built.

All airports in the South East are expected to be at full capacity by 2030, which has led to growing concern among business leaders about future airport provision.

The Department for Transport is due to produce a report on aviation in 2013.

A spokesman said: ‘The concept of a Thames airport forms a useful contribution to the debate and will be considered alongside all other responses.’

The four-runway airport which will be located sparse strip of land on the Isle of Grain, in Ken was designed by architect Lord Norman 
Foster – who created the new Wembley Stadium.

The airport would be a 
modern-day feat of British engineering built on reclaimed marshland. It 
would include the UK’s busiest railway station, handling 300,000 
passengers a day.

Planes would fly in from the 
north-east, primarily over water, greatly reducing the number of homes 
that would be affected by aircraft noise.

However not everyone has leant their support.

Councillor Rodney Chambers, leader of
Medway Council in Kent, said: ‘The Isle of Grain is home to one of the 
world’s largest liquefied natural gas terminals, with a fifth of the 
UK’s gas supply offloaded by container ships and stored there.

‘We have looked at Lord Foster’s plan
and he appears to want to place his fantasy Isle of Grain airport on 
top of the LNG plant and a power station. It beggars belief.’

Lord Foster said: ‘We need to 
recapture the foresight and political courage of our 19th century 
forebears if we are to establish a modern transport and energy 
infrastructure in Britain for this century and beyond. We can do it 
here.’

Danger: Medway Council say mixing the Liquefied Natural Gas import facility on the Isle of Grain, pictured, with a new airport would be a recipe for disaster

Lethal: The liquid gas for the area comes via the container port at the Isle of Grain, which protesters also say makes the area the wrong choice for an airport

Chancellor George Osborne has apparently changed his mind on the move and is now in favour of the project

A railway station to be built under the new airport would be the UK's busiest, handling 300,000 arrivals and departures a day
