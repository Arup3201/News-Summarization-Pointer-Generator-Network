At the inquest into the death of a young woman who was killed when her car slammed into a tree, conflicting accounts of her last moments came to light.

Sarah Durazza was travelling along the Wakehurst Parkway in Narrabeen on Sydney's northern beaches last August when she crashed her car and was killed almost instantly.

The 26-year-old swerved, crossed lanes and smashed into a tree in her Holden Barina while apparently on the phone to her boyfriend, who raced to the scene after he heard the accident.

However at court on Tuesday, confusion emerged over who was actually on the phone to Ms Durazza when she died.

Sarah Durazza was killed in a car crash last year when she lost control of her vehicle and veered off the road into a treeÂ 

It was originally thought that Ms Durazza's boyfriend, Scott Bidder had answered a call from the part-time model, but her mother, Fiona, told Parramatta Local Court she was the one who took the call, according to The Daily Telegraph.

'I heard her breathing and then one last gasp,' Mrs Durazza revealed, speaking of her recollection of her daughter's last moments.

Mrs Durazza said she had been in the car with Mr Bidden searching for Ms Durazza when she answered the phone.

However the Mona Vale model's boyfriend said he was the one who spoke to her, and was in the car alone when he picked up the phone, heard her swear, and then listened to the sound of the crash and Ms Durazza's final breaths.

The part-time model was apparently on the phone to her boyfriend Scott Bidder at the time of the accident, and a court has heard that distraction may have contributed to her death

Also at the inquest into the death of the beautician and part-time model, a magistrate called for a total ban on mobile phones in cars.

Magistrate Hugh Dillon said 'Frankly, If it was up to me I would ban mobile phones in cars all together',

Magistrate Dillon is set to release the formal findings of Ms Durazza's death early next month, but said it was likely that distraction caused by her mobile phone played a role in the accident.

Mrs Durazza described the Wakehurst Parkway as a dangerous strip of road, despite crime scene investigators saying the road was in good condition.

She revealed she wanted the road upgraded and called for better lighting and more guard rails to be installed.

Fiona, Ms Durazza's mother, called for the road to be upgraded while at Parramatta Court on Tuesday

Ms Durazza was the woman at the centre of a scandal involving a Manly Sea Eagles rugby league player in 2009.

She was attending a pre-season party with her father Paul, a sponsor of the club, when Anthony Watmough, Brett Stewart and Matt Orford began insulting her.

In the fallout, Ms Durazza's father was alleged to have taken a swing at Watmough before officers were called to the Manly Wharf Hotel where the event was held.
