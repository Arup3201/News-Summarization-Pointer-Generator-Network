It's no wonder that Jimmy Kimmel told Shia LaBeouf that he 'seems to have gone crazy' when he interviewed him recently.

The star was arrested for criminal trespass, disorderly conduct, and harassment at a Broadway production of Cabaret, after being photographed chasing a homeless man around Times Square and was filmed sitting in silence for an hour - bar a few giggles - with a British journalist. 

He also turned up to the premiere of his film Nymphomaniac wearing a paper bag over his head.

Now the Hollywood star is claiming that a woman raped him on Valentine's Day.

LaBeouf claims the incident happened during his week-long #IAMSORRY performance art installation.

'It was painful': Shia LaBeouf claims a woman raped him on Valentine's Day during his #IAMSORRY performance art installation at the Stephen Cohen Gallery in Los Angeles, California

For five days, the 28-year-old actor invited the public to visit him one-on-one in a small room in a Los Angeles gallery where he sat wearing a paper bag over his face that read: 'I AM NOT FAMOUS ANYMORE' - the same one he wore to the film premiere.

But three days in, a woman allegedly stripped and raped the former Disney Channel actor while their respective partners stood in line.  

LaBeouf did not explain whether he attempted to stop the alleged attack during his silent performance at the Stephen Cohen Gallery. He was reportedly unresponsive and silent during every one-to-one meeting.

The Nymphomaniac actor opened up about the incident on Thursday during a bizarre interview with Dazed Digital, conducted over email before he and the reporter sat staring at each other in silence for an hour.

'One woman came with her boyfriend, who was outside the door when this happened,' the Daytime Emmy winner wrote in his email interview.

'[She] whipped my legs for 10 minutes and then stripped my clothing and proceeded to rape me. 

'There were hundreds of people in line when she walked out with dishevelled hair and smudged lipstick. It was no good, not just for me but her man as well.' 

He explained Mia Goth, his girlfriend of two years, was among the 'hundreds' waiting for a one-on-one with him when the woman left his room.

The 28-year-old actor recalled: '[She] whipped my legs for 10 minutes and then stripped my clothing and proceeded to rape me...as hundreds of people [stood] in line'

'We both sat with this unexplained trauma silently': Even more unsettling was that Shia's girlfriend of two years, Mia Goth, was among the 'hundreds' waiting for a one-on-one with him (pictured on Tuesday)

'Some would hold my hand and cry with me, some would tell me  to "be a man"': The Nymphomaniac actor also felt terrible when gallery patrons would 'come in, take my [paper] bag off, pop off a selfie, and bounce'

'It was Valentine’s Day and I was living in the gallery for the duration [February 11-16] of the event,' LaBeouf wrote. 

'We were separated for five days, no communication. 

'So it really hurt her as well, as I guess the news of it travelled through the line. 

'When she came in she asked for an explanation, and I couldn’t speak, so we both sat with this unexplained trauma silently. It was painful.' 

LaBeouf also vented his frustration at gallery patrons who would 'come in, take my [paper] bag off, pop off a selfie, and bounce.'

'Some would hold my hand and cry with me, some would tell me to "figure it out" or to "be a man." I’ve never experienced love like that; empathy, humanity.' 

In the wide-reaching interview, LaBeouf confessed that he longed for the kind of family he saw in the 1990 flick Home Alone.

'I always had a f****d up view on masculinity,' he admitted.

'Metamodernist encounter': After corresponding with British reporter Aimee Cliff for two weeks online, the pair donned GoPros and sat together silently in LaBeouf's London hotel room last month

Seriously? The pretentious, hour-long 'metamodernist encounter' was mostly a chance for the two to stare awkwardly with intermittent giggles

#IAMSORRY was the culmination of several bizarre incidents - belligerent outbursts, plagiarism, and public martyrdom involving paper-bag masks marked: 'I am not famous anymore' (pictured February 9)

'My father [Jeffrey] was a gun nut like Hemingway. He was also a junkie and a bully, mainly to prove he wasn’t effeminate, even though he was a painter and a poet, a mime, and a storyteller.'

In June, the Transformers star was arrested for criminal trespass, disorderly conduct, and harassment at a Broadway production of Cabaret.

In an interview with Jimmy Kimmel he explained that his arrest came after he'd been drinking whiskey for several hours following a trip to Ireland and that he was merely trying to calm the homeless man he was photographed with in Times Square.
