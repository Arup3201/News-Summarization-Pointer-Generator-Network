A British company has created the ultimate boy toy every aspiring James Bond will want for Christmas - a wrist-mounted underwater jet pack.

The current prototype, called the ‘x2 Underwater Jet Pack’, is a unique arm-worn delivery system that generates powerful vectored thrust, amplifying movements of the user’s arms.

The creators say it gives scuba and free-divers a new way to explore freestyle underwater acrobatics as well as simply fly around underwater.

Unfortunately, the £3,500 gadget will not be released until next year,

It is the brainchild of Portsmouth-based start-up S.C.P Marine Innovation and is powered by the latest lithium battery technology, coupled with state-of-the-art digital motors and a wireless control system.

'The weightless environment underwater provides amazing potential for acrobatic stunts and freedom of movement,' said Simon Parke, co-inventor and co-founder of S.C.P. Marine Innovation.

Thrust: The inventors say the X2 'redefines underwater propulsion'

He added: 'The optimum position when using other technology is to hold it out directly in front of you, but this often means that the thrust is directed straight at the user.

The X2 uses two propellers strapped to the outside of the user's wrist.

It is powered by a lithium battery and controlled wirelessly.

The inventors say it is superior to other underwater propulsion systems because the thrust doesn't go straight into the users body.

'The x2 Underwater Jet Pack is worn on the outer arms and is fast, manoeuvrable, un-tethered, and frankly redefines underwater propulsion.'

The company's website also features the conceptual 'Fitting x2 Underwater Jet Pack System', which boasts a fully-enclosed body suit that makes the user look like a science fiction super-soldier.

S.C.P claims powered marine action sports is a dynamic new growth market and is trying to raise capital through Sharein, a crowdfunding company.
