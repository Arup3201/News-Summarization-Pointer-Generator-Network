Ronaldinho has revealed that Lionel Messi made the step up to the Barcelona first team after the players asked manager Frank Rijkaard to promote him.

Four-time world player of the year Messi made his Barcelona debut in 2004 at just 17 and has gone on to illuminate the football world, winning countless accolades and breaking numerous records.

And former team-mate Ronaldinho says that it was the players who convinced Rijkaard to give Messi his chance, and the 34-year-old believes the Argentina international is better than Real Mardid forward Cristiano Ronaldo.

After making his debut in 2004, Messi scored six goals during the 2005-06 season

'It was the players who asked Rijkaard to promote Messi to first team training,' Ronaldinho is quoted as saying on marca.com.

'Cristiano Ronaldo is a very complete player, but Messi is better because he has magic.'

Ronaldinho, who enjoyed five success-laden seasons with the Catalan club and was twice crowned the world's best player, also spoke of his rushed transfer to Spain from PSG after almost signing for Manchester United.

'Everything happened very quickly. A good friend of mine who was running to be on the Barcelona board, Sandro Rosell, had asked me if I'd play for Barcelona when they won the election and I told him that I would.

'I was on the brink of joining Manchester United, there were just a few details to iron out, but Rosell called me at the last minute to tell me that they were going to win the election. That made everything happen very fast.'
