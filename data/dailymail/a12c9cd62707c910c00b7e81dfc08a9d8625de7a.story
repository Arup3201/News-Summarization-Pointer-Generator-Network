A pair of drinking buddies became friends after discovering they were married to the same woman. 

Chris Thomas and Peter Sherratt, both 47, met when they found they were both married to bigamist Karen Sherratt, 45.

She is now out the picture - but their friendship has lasted in what they described as the 'only good thing' to come out their 'hellish' experience.

Mr Sherratt (pictured) fell quickly for Karen after they met in 2005 and they married within a year in a lavish ceremony at Edinburgh Castle - but he walked out in 2006 when he found their shared accounts were empty

Former RAF serviceman Chris Thomas (pictured), who is now a gas engineer, married Karen in 2012 in front of 40 guests at Cardiff's Holiday Inn - but months later he found out she was already married when he found a petition for divorce from Mr Sherratt in her laptop bag

Wedding cheat Sherratt was jailed for four months this summer when she was convicted of bigamy.

Her husbands could not contact each other before the trial was over due to the legal process – but when they met for a pint afterwards they struck up a close friendship. 

Mr Thomas, a former RAF serviceman, said: 'It might seem odd to some people that we get on so well.

'But we have an ex-wife in common. We have had a shared experience too. She had us both under her spell and our close friendship is a result of that.'  

Mr Sherratt, pictured after his wedding to Karen that took place at Edinburgh Castle, has since found a new partner

Mr Sherratt, pictured during happier times celebrating his 40th birthday, was smitten by Karen (to his left) when he first met her - but they split up when he found she was being deceptive about their finances

Mr Sherratt was immediately attracted to Karen (far right), an area manager for a food company, but shortly after the wedding in September 2006, cracks began to appear

Sherratt, an area manager for a food company, had already been married and divorced when she met Mr Sherratt, from Swansea, in 2005.

Their relationship blossomed and they were married within a year. 

But shortly after the wedding, Mr Sherratt starting having serious concerns when the joint bank account he shared with his wife frequently crept into its overdraft. 

Just a year since they were married, Mr Sherratt left his wife at their marital home in Swansea. 

Six years later in 2012 Sherratt met Mr Thomas on a dating website – and he fell for her quickly, just like Mr Sherratt had.

In a similar way to Mr Sherratt, he proposed quickly - within three and a half months. Only seven months since meeting Sherratt, the couple were married at Cardiff's Holiday Inn. 

But there was one serious hitch - although Sherratt was separated from Mr Sherratt, she had never formally divorced him and so they were still legally married. 

Mr Thomas found out about the bombshell last December when he found a petition for divorce from Mr Sherratt in his wife's laptop bag. 

Devastated, he took a copy and left it on the kitchen table for his wife to find, before leaving their home in Swansea - the same one she had shared with her former husband. He has since moved to Caerphilly. 

Similarly to his friend Mr Sherratt, Mr Thomas, from Caerphilly, became so taken with Karen he proposed very quickly and the couple married in March this year at the Holiday Inn, in Cardiff 

The pair met on a dating site in April 2012 and got engaged four months later, before marrying last March

He then contacted Mr Sherratt to break the news to him. 

He said: 'I wanted him to know that I existed when I first found out.

'So I let his solicitor know that Karen had remarried and was a bigamist.'

He added: 'As soon as it was ­discovered she was still married, our wedding became null and void. I'm thankful she has no claim over my home or assets but the betrayal has shattered my confidence. 

'I don't trust my own judgement anymore and I'm off work with the stress of it all.' 

During her sentencing at Cardiff Crown Court in June, Mr Recorder IWL Jones told her: 'It is rare for a case like this to come before the court, especially one involving a woman.

'Bigamy is clearly a serious offence that strikes at the heart of the marriage system. 

'I have no doubt at all that you are a deceitful and dishonest woman and that Mr Thomas is the victim.

'You cried during the course of this hearing, but I am by no means at all convinced that you are remorseful.'

The pair have now struck up an unlikely friendship which they said was the 'only good thing' to come out of the hellish experience

The friends meet regularly for a beer and a game of pool in Bridgend, South Wales - which is half way between their homes in Caerphilly and Swansea 

After she was jailed, Mr Sherratt and Mr Thomas met to discuss their respective marriages to the bigamist.  

Mr Thomas said: 'After the trial we became quite friendly and had some long chats over the phone about what we'd been through and the kind of woman she was.

'After that it was pretty clear we had this bonding ­experience and we were going to be mates for a long time.

'His friendship is the only good thing to come out of this hell.'  

Now the pair meet regularly for a beer and a game of pool.

Mr Sherratt said: 'It's been almost seven years since I was in Karen's grip so I have moved on and found a new partner who I love and trust and that's a whole different experience for me.

'I look at Chris now and I can see his pain and anger and I've been there too, so I can hopefully help him to move on past his upset.

'But it is hard. You never get over the deception and feelings of being a fool.'
