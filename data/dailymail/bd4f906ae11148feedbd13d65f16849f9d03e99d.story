England cricketer Kevin Pietersen has opened a luxury hair salon which focuses solely on haircuts for children

England cricketer Kevin Pietersen has opened a luxury hair salon which focuses solely on haircuts for children.

The salon, called Bella and Beau, opened yesterday in Notting Hill in West London.

The batsman and his wife, pop star Jessica Pietersen, have spent thousands on their unique vision, with furnishing based around the preferences of their three-year-old son Dylan.

Furnishings include a New York-style 
taxi, a Harley Davidson, an aeroplane and a giant toy firetruck, all of 
which are there for the entertainment of children frequenting the store.

A trim for a toddler will cost £25, while an eight year old will be charged £40 for the same service.

Children
 can have their hair cut sitting in the various toys throughout the 
store, like a toy car, as well as being provided an iPad to distract 
them while they get the cut.

In addition, there is a large fish tank full up with 30 sea horses to calm the young children.

The
 owners and collaborators in the venture have been very vocal about the 
project on Twitter, keen to create a presence in the competitive high 
class hair salon market.

Jessica Pietersen told the Sun: 'It's an expensive venture, so I hope it works.

'I won't be cutting hair, and definitely not Kevin.'

Kevin Pietersen's cricketing career has hit a snag in recent weeks, with the 5-0 ashes defeat causing the relationship between him and the ex-England coach, Andy Flower, to break down.

England officials have stressed that Flower's decision to leave as coach of the Test team was not connected to the breakdown of the relationship with the batting star, but nevertheless, he will have a major say in what happens next in Pietersen's career.

 For various reasons, Pietersen has played little limited overs cricket for England in the past two years.

Since playing against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates in February 2012, Pietersen has featured in just nine of a possible 37 ODIs and none of their last 20 T20s, though he was selected against New Zealand at The Oval last summer that was subsequently abandoned.

Pietersen's absences have occurred through a mixture of injury, rest and temporary retirement, and though he retains appeal as one of the most destructive batsmen in world cricket, England may feel his troublesome knee may reduce his all-round effectiveness.

In addition, insiders maintain the surprise news of Flower's departure means no immediate change to the thinking that Pietersen's days in Test cricket are numbered, no matter who replaces the ex-England coach.
