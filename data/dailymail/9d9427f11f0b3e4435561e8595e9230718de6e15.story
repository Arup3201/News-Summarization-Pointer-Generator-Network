The second fatal victim of the Boston Marathon terror attacks has been identified as a 29-year-old steakhouse manager who went to the race every year.

Doctors initially told William Campbell Jr. that his daughter Krystle had survived the bombing.

But doctors had mistaken her for her best friend, Karen Rand, because Rand had been carrying Campbell's identification and was in surgery and unable to correct the mistake.

Campbell spent 12 hours believing his daughter had survived and only learned the truth after going into the post-operating room and saw Rand lying there instead.

'We had the doctors come out and tell us everything they did (to save Rand) — and it wasn’t our daughter,' Campbell said.

Victim: Krystle Campbell's parents had believed she survived for 12 hours and only learned she had died after going into the hospital room and finding Miss Rand instead

Krystle went to marathon, which she did every year, and was with Rand, cheering on Rand’s boyfriend.

They were struck by the first blast as they waited near the finish line.

William Campbell rushed to the hospital and felt relieved when doctors said they were operating on their daughter's leg at Massachusetts General Hospital.

But when nurses brought him into a post-operating room around 2 a.m. and saw Rand instead.

'I said, "That’s not my daughter, that’s Karen! Where’s my daughter?" The doctors were as shocked as we were,' Campbell said.

A Boston detective later showed them a photo of Krystle, who worked as a manager at Jimmy's Steakhouse.

'I almost passed out on the floor,' Campbell said as he was about to view his daughter's body. 

'She was the best person you’d ever 
meet. She helped everybody,' Campbell said. 'I don’t care who you were, 
she was always there.'

Krystle was one of the three victims 
killed in the two blasts that came just seconds apart. The first victim 
identified was eight-year-old Martin Richard.

There were 183 people injured in the attack, and 23 people remain in critical condition. As many as 10 people suffered a lost limb, including two children.

'My daughter was the most lovable girl. 
She helped everybody, and I'm just so shocked right now. We're just 
devastated,' he said.

'She was a wonderful, wonderful girl. Always 
willing to lend a hand.'

Krystle went to watch the Marathon every year, according to Boston.com.

Krystle's mother, Patty Campbell, was overwhelmed with grief when she addressed reporters gathered outside her home on in Medford, Massachusetts on Tuesday.

'She had a heart of gold...she was always smiling and friendly,' Patty Campbell said, fighting back tears as she remembered Krystle.

'I couldn't ask for a better daughter. It's hard to believe this is happening. This doesn't make any sense.'

Krystle's grandmother Lillian Campbell said she went to the marathon every year 'because she loved people'

'She was the best,' the mother said.

'She’s been doing it since she was a little girl,' said her grandmother, Lillian Campbell. 'She didn’t miss a Marathon, watching it at the finish line.

'She enjoyed doing it because she liked people. She’d meet a lot of people over there. She was very friendly, Krystle. She’d talk to anybody.'

Her grandmother added that Krystle had just moved to the town a short time ago.

She was living with her grandmother to care for her during an illness for the past couple of years.

Lillian said that her granddaughter 'was just beautiful.

'She was fun, outgoing person. She was always there to help somebody. All her friends loved her.

'The family is besides themselves now because something happened to her,' the grandmother said.

Tragedy: Krystle Campbell worked as a manager at a steakhouse and was living with her ill grandmother so she could take care of her

Before working at the steakhouse, Krystle was a manager at The Summer Shack.

'The
 Summer Shack family is devastated by the loss of our beloved Krystle 
Campbell. Please keep her & her family in your thoughts & 
prayers,' the popular restaurant Tweeted this afternoon.

She attended the University of Massachusetts-Boston and was graduate of Medford High School.

Her father had harsh words for whoever carried out the attack.

'I’m very angry. I hope they catch the bastard and fry him,' Campbell said of whoever perpetrated the worst terror attack on U.S. soil since 9/11.

'I can’t understand it — someone doing that. People are out there enjoying a beautiful day and then to have this happen.

'And then the little boy that passed,' he told the New York Daily News, referring to 8-year-old Martin Richard. 'It’s totally tragic.'

The mayor of Medford, Mass., Krystle's hometown, said he had attempted to console her father.

'Mr. Campbell said that she certainly was a dream daughter, the daughter that every father dreams to have and friends of hers said that she was eager about life,' Mayor Michael McGlynn said, according to Reuters.

'She had a great sense of humor and freckles and red hair that brought her right to her Irish roots. She was someone who worked hard at everything she did.' McGlynn said.

'Another friend said she may have been a little loud at times but it was a loudness you loved.'

A former colleague of Krystle's, Steve Sullivan of Pembroke, MA, told BuzzFeed that Krystle was 'a beautiful person' and 'an angel.'

'Whenever I saw her she always had a smile on her face.' 

Campbell's death was reported as authorities released further information about the type of bombs used in the attack.

The two bombs were made from six-liter pressure cookers crammed with shards of metal, nails and ball bearings and stashed in black backpacks, police sources revealed today.

The cruelly-designed bombs have 'frequently' been used in Afghanistan, India, Nepal and Pakistan, according to a 2010 Homeland Security Department pamphlet - hinting at the origins of the bombers behind the worst terrorist atrocity in the U.S. since 9/11.

When the devices exploded near the crowded Boston Marathon finish line around 2:50pm on Monday, victims suffered as many as 40 shrapnel wounds each and at least 10 people needed amputations.

Witnesses described seeing body parts flying through the air and shoes that 'still had flesh in them.'

Fatal victim Martin Richard's younger sister, Jane, lost a 
leg in the explosion and his mother Denise is in hospital after 
undergoing brain surgery.

Martin's older brother, 12-year-old Henry, 
escaped injury while his father suffered minor shrapnel wounds to his 
legs.

The bombs used to kill and maim are believed to have contained black powder or gunpowder as the explosive, and information on how to make such a bomb is available on the internet, experts said.

he devices were then left at the scene to look like discarded property, CBS News reported.

Investigators have also found pieces of an electronic circuit board which could indicate a timer was used in the detonation.
