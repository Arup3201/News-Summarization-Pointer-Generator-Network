The European Union has sparked fury after it approved a plan for a 'social police' to control benefits handouts, healthcare and homelessness across the continent.

The plan is among a raft of measures laid out in a new report that calls for the creation of a 'social scoreboard' to allow for a 'better and earlier identification of major employment and social problems'.

But the plan, approved by a majority of the Parliament sitting in Strasbourg last week, triggered anger among Conservative MEPs who claim the EU is attempting to impose itself as 'Europe's social 
conscience.'

Controversial: The plan was approved by a majority of the Parliament sitting in Strasbourg last week prompting anger among Conservative MEPs who attempted to have the measures thrown out

Anthea McIntyre MEP, Conservative 
spokesman on employment and social affairs, said: 'Clearly this is the 
Parliament manoeuvring to create a role for the EU as Europe's social 
conscience.    

'Worse than
 that, they want to appropriate powers to supervise and intervene over 
the way member states deal with social problems. They want to set 
themselves up as the social police.

'Nobody
 is saying poverty, ill health and homelessness are not real problems in
 need of real solutions. What we are saying is that individual states 
and governments must be allowed to address them as they see fit, not 
according to a set of rules set down in Brussels.

'Sadly,
 my Labour and Liberal colleagues appear to think British voters are not
 responsible or compassionate enough to decide for themselves how to 
respond.'

Angry: MEP Anthea McIntyre branded the move as an attempt to create 'social police'

Under the title 'Social Dimensions of the European Monetary Union', the report, by French Socialist MEP Pervenche Beres, seeks to treat 'social imbalances on the same footing as economic indicators such as gross domestic product or national debt,' she added. 

The report calls for a 'social scoreboard' to score member states on measures such as child-poverty levels, access to healthcare, homelessness on a 'decent-work index'.    

But Tory MEPs say that, although the report is presented in the context of the single currency, there is no clause exempting countries outside the Eurozone, such as the United Kingdom.    

The text also makes references to a European Unemployment Benefit Scheme, Ms McIntyre said, claiming it betrayed a 'clear ambition for Brussels to control benefits payments across Europe'. 

However, the European Public Health Alliance (EPHA) called the plan 'a potential watershed moment in economic governance', adding: 'With one out of four people in the EU at risk of poverty or social exclusion and 11 per cent unemployment, it is clear that the current approach has not delivered on the Europe 2020 poverty and employment targets.

'This resolution will convey that a much stronger commitment is required from the EU and Member States to achieve the social objectives of the EU.'

European Commission president Jose Manuel Barroso added: 'The EU has taken giant 
leaps forward in terms of economic governance in the last five years, 
providing financial lifelines to many vulnerable Member States.

Vital reform: European Commission president Jose Manuel Barroso said the plans would ensure there is a 'strong social dimension in the way we run our Economic and Monetary Union'

'From the
 start of the crisis, we have taken targeted action to deal with the 
social distress created in part of our societies.

'But the severity of 
the crisis, particularly in the euro area, has taught us that we need to
 work even more closely to heal the social scars it has left behind.

'This Communication is about building on the rules we have already put in
 place under the European Semester to ensure there is a strong social 
dimension in the way we run our Economic and Monetary Union. We owe that
 to the 26 million unemployed and the most deprived in our society.'
