Tragedy: Fiona Geraghty, 14, hanged herself because she had been bullied over her weight an inquest was told

A girl of 14 hanged herself  after being taunted about  her weight at her prestigious  private school, an inquest was told yesterday.

Fiona Geraghty, who was nicknamed ‘yo-yo’ because of her  bouncy personality, developed bulimia after being called ‘fat’ by a  group of playground bullies.

Although the teenager had been  popular at her previous school, she  failed to settle in after moving to  £15,000-a-year King’s College in Taunton, Somerset, a coroner heard.

Yesterday Fiona’s mother, Dr Elspeth Geraghty, a GP, said she felt let  down by the school and psychiatric experts who saw Fiona four times before discharging her.

She also revealed her daughter had written an essay referring to her health problems and ‘self-loathing’ in the term before her death – but that the school had failed to pass it on to her family.

Dr Geraghty told the inquest: ‘I am disappointed the college failed to apply its own learning to its behaviour.

‘There was no real concern or significance placed on the events in that term. I also feel let down by the mental health services. Eating disorders such as this suffered by Fiona are the result of an underlying psychiatric problem.

‘Being seen on four occasions before being discharged seems a wholly  inappropriate response.’

Dr Geraghty also claimed her daughter had begun vomiting ‘following taunts from other girls about her size’.

‘She did have some relationship  problems within her peer group,’ she added.

‘I became aware Fiona had a serious eating disorder when I was contacted by her housemasters in February 2011. They said she had been vomiting.’

The teenager was taken to see Ross Gillanders, a community psychiatric nurse with the Somerset NHS Trust.

He believed she had an unspecified eating disorder, but claimed her binges were more the result of hunger.

He saw Fiona four times, between  April 12 and May 5 last year, before  discharging her from his care.

Mr Gillanders told the inquest: ‘I thought she was not seriously unwell. There are cases where you can be blindsided. Her problems at school were resolved, her weight was improving and she had plans for the future.’

The inquest also heard that her  parents had recently confiscated her laptop after she wrote on Facebook about her father’s confidential work as a hospital consultant.

Loved: Fiona was described by an aunt as a 'beautiful, sunny child who had everything going for her'

Help: Fiona saw a community psychiatric nurse on four occasions before she was discharged just two weeks before she committed suicide, the Taunton hearing was told

She had also uploaded her cousin’s 
passport photo, forcing the relative to get new travel documents and 
delay their travel plans.

Two months after being discharged, on
July 14 last year, her father, Dr John Geraghty, found Fiona’s body at 
their home in Nailsbourne, Somerset.

A letter was taken from the scene by police officers and pathologist John Oxley later gave the cause of death  as hanging.

According to toxicology reports there were no traces of alcohol of drugs in her system.

Two months later, her parents discovered a diary in which Fiona had revealed the full extent of her eating disorder. Mr Gillanders told West Somerset Coroner Michael Rose that had he seen the diary, he would have concluded she had bulimia.

School: The inquest heard that the Fiona had been very popular at her 
previous school but had been targeted by a group of her peers at the 
£15,000 a year King's College in Taunton

However, Bryan Lask, professor of child and adolescent psychiatry at the University of London, criticised Somerset Partnership NHS Trust.

‘I don’t know how the full clinical picture could have been evident in just four sessions,’ he said.

‘There was insufficient information about what was happening in her life. The parents should have been  much more involved throughout the process. Any child who induces vomiting is in a very troubled state.’

Paying tribute to Fiona, her aunt Fiona Symondson said: ‘She was  very bubbly and always had a smile on her face. Fiona was a very beautiful, sunny child who had everything  going for her.

‘Everybody has a smile on their face now when they think of her.’

The hearing in Taunton is expected to end today.
