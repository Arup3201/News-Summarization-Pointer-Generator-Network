In the midst of a grueling, final-hour push by Congress to rescue the economy from the looming fiscal cliff, House Speaker John Boehner sought brief reprieve with an evening of margaritas and Mexican fare in Arlington, a source told Mail Online. 

Dressed in a festive, bright red sweater, a cheery Boehner arrived through a side door at Guapo's in Shirlington around 7:15 p.m. Friday - about three hours after he left stone-faced from a meeting at the White House with other congressional leaders and President Obama - according to a diner who happened to arrive at the restaurant around the same time.

Accompanying Boehner to his table Friday were about six men - all security detail - who stood behind him for about 30 seconds and then sat down at a table nearby, said the diner, who works in government and said she wished to remain anonymous.

House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, was spotted at Guapo's Restaurant in Arlington Friday evening drinking margaritas with a group of three

After his night at Guapo's, Boehner returned to Capitol Hill, where senators were working on a solution to avert the fiscal cliff

Boehner was drinking margaritas while most of his party - two men and one woman - were drinking beer and sangria, the source said.

They were all chomping on chips and salsa at the table.

Other diners in the restaurant recognized the House Speaker and approached his table to say hello, the source noted. 

Boehner was 'very friendly to anyone that went up and spoke to him,' she said.

Despite the long weekend of work ahead of him, 'He and his group were laughing and having a good time,' the source said. 

Several times throughout the evening Boehner stepped outside - through the side door - to take smoke breaks with some of his security detail, she added.

'We saw him walking out when we were leaving at 8:30,' she said. 'We passed two of his detail driving away then so we assumed he was leaving for the night, but it could have just been another smoke break.'

Meanwhile, on Saturday, Senate leaders were working feverishly in private for a last-hour budget solution that could prevent the fiscal cliff - a package of tax increases for the middle class tax and deep spending cuts - from being triggered at dawn on New Year's Day. 

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, a Democrat, and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, are trying to find a solution in time for votes Sunday night by both houses.

Whatever manages to pass in the Senate, with its Democratic majority, would then face a second test in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives.

Boehner arrived at the restaurant through a side door about three hours after he left a White House meeting on the fiscal cliff, and he'd changed out of his work clothes and into a festive red sweater

Boehner and his party at Guapo's were 'laughing and having a good time' - a far cry from how he appeared after his meeting at the White House hours earlier

Boehner, a Republican speaker who has 
struggled recently with anti-tax rebels inside his own party, said 
through an aide that he would await the results of the talks between the
 Senate and White House.

With the deadline for action fast approaching, Obama reiterated his demand for Congress to strike a deal that would prevent taxes from rising on the middle class. 

'It's a balanced plan — one that would protect the middle class, cut spending in a responsible way, and ask the wealthiest Americans to pay a little more,' Obama said in his weekly radio address.

'And I'll keep working with anybody who's serious about getting a comprehensive plan like this done — because it's the right thing to do for our economic growth.'

Obama is expected to renew his demands during a rare appearance on NBC's 'Meet the Press' on Sunday. 

In a rebuttal to Obama on Saturday, Republicans held their ground on their view of how the fiscal cliff should be resolved. 

'The president's proposal to raise taxes on the top 2 percent of Americans won't even pay one-third of the annual interest that's now owed on this massive $16 trillion debt,' Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Missouri, said. 'We still can avoid going over the fiscal cliff if the president and the Democrat-controlled Senate step forward this week and work with Republicans to solve this problem and solve it now.'
