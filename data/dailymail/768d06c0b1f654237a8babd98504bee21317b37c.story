A successful marriage can be achieved in six steps over 21 days, say a married therapist couple.

In Making Happy: The Art and Science of a Happy Marriage, Dr
 Les and Leslie Parrott claim trying new hobbies, doing something 
charitable together and writing 'gratitude letters' to those that have 
supported their relationship are just some of the steps that can 
transform your marriage from 'good' to 'great.'

Implementing these steps over the course of three weeks promises to give a 25per cent happiness boost to any flailing relationship, say the Seattle-based couple.

Happy marriage: A new book promises to save your relationship in just 21 days, by following a 'six point happiness plan'

Dr Les Parrott is a clinical psychologist and his wife of 29 years,  Dr. Leslie Parrott, is a marriage and family therapist.

'A
 lot of couples sail along and do fine, they don’t want to rock the
 boat, but they’re missing out on the next level of commitment,' Dr Les tells MailOnline.

‘One of the biggest complaints we hear is that the couple's "spark" has gone, but by making little changes and creating new habits, you can kick the boredom and monotony out of your marriage and be much happier.

'And we know from psychological research that it takes three weeks to form a new habit.'

One of the book's 'Happiness Boosters' is, ‘Count your blessings,’ meaning couples must tell each other precisely what they are grateful for.

‘This will instantly increases your level of happiness,’ says Dr Parrott.

'By 
making little changes and creating new habits, you can kick the boredom and
 monotony out of your marriage'

‘Gratitude puts things in perspective. You can’t help but become more satisfied with what you have in your own life.’

The book also suggests couples write a letter to someone other than their own spouse, who
has been a significant part of their relationship - perhaps a parent they model their marriage on or a friend who gives brilliant advice.

But instead of sending them the letter, the doctors advise that couples read it to them aloud.

Not only will this make the recipient feel incredible, but it’s a reminder of the strength of a couple’s relationship, explains the doctors.

And while date nights are all well and good, going to the same old restaurant every Friday night simply won’t do.

The book instructs couples to try brand new activities together to recreate the chemistry of when they first fell in love.

‘This has been proven to change the chemistry in your brain,’ says Dr Parrott.

‘You can’t help but come away feeling more energized and excited.’

Another 'Happiness Booster' is ‘Celebrating each other,’ where the book encourages couples to give more attention and conversation time to positive things that happened to their partner that day.

'Celebrating 
positive things together greatly strengthens your 
relationship'

‘This shows that you’re supporting each other,’ says Dr Parrott.

'It's not about just taking an interest in your spouse but celebrating 
positive things together, which we’ve found greatly strengthens 
relationships. You should be each others biggest cheerleaders.’

Discussing the future is another vital step: ‘The moment a couple stops looking toward future, they are defeated,’ says Dr Parrott.

‘You have to be able to see where you are headed because, not only is it exciting to have a plan and something to look forward to, but also it certifies your commitment to one another.'

He suggests that a couple talks about what they want to have accomplished together in five years and where they want to be in ten years, like a business plan but for marriage.

For
 the more spiritual couples out there, in the ‘Attune Your Spirits’ 
chapter, couples are encouraged to pray or meditate together, which the 
authors are convinced will also bring partners closer.

Not so New Age-inclined? ‘Feel free to skip this step in that case,’ laughs Dr Parrott.

Finally, though the ‘Happiness Boosters’ do not need to be completed in any particular order, the book advises couples to ‘add value to others,' essentially asking them to look beyond their own marriage to those less fortune and help them together.

This

 could mean sponsoring a child (something the Parrotts have done and 
say it strengthened their relationship) or taking part in a charitable 
event or activity.

‘This is a big step and the effect is immediate,’ says Dr Parrott.

‘When a couple reaches out beyond boundaries of their own married life, it adds value to their life and becomes fulfilling.’

Once
 the book defines and explains each of these steps it draws out the 
21-day plan, suggesting how a couple can implement certain elements of each 
'Booster' to their marriage that day.

‘The plan works because couples become conscious of activities they can do together which will bring them closer and make them more grateful,’ says Dr Parrott.

‘It doesn’t require a major overhaul or a lot of hard work; it’s just about paying a little bit more attention to detail and making a little more effort in specific ways.'

The biggest message of this book, says Dr Parrott, is that marriage doesn’t make people happy, it is people that make their marriage happy.

‘Our research says that when you rely on your marriage as a "happy pill," you can elevate your mood for two years but, after that, the honeymoon period has worn off and you have to work at it,’ he says.

‘Any marriage in any stage can benefit: One that is doing badly will do better and one that is good will become great.'

Drs Les and Leslie Parrott have written several books, including Saving Your Marriage Before It Starts, which has sold over a million copies.

Their books, The Hour That Matters the Most and You're Stronger Than You Think were both number one on the New York Times Bestsellers List.

In 1991, they founded the Center for Relationship Development on the campus of Seattle Pacific University – a program dedicated to teaching the basics of good relationships.

They have been together for 37 years after meeting in Junior High School and married seven years later.

They live in Seattle with their two sons and, in June, will celebrate their 30th wedding anniversary.
