The first American to win a contract at the prestigious Bolshoi Ballet in Moscow has left after a year of scandal and intrigue at the theater, claiming she was advised to pay bribes just to appear on stage.

Joy Womack, 19, was born in California, but moved to Russia at the age of 15 to train with the school and graduated in May 2012.

This week she explained her struggles and isolation at the world's leading ballet institution and how she was told that a payment of at least $10,000 would be required just for a minor role.

Accusations: Joy Womack stands outside the prestigious Bolshoi Ballet in Moscow. She was the first American to get a contract at the famous theater, but recently quit amid claims that she was advised to pay bribes to get parts

Sadness: Womack described leaving the theater as like 'breaking up with your first love.' She posted these images to Twitter with the captions 'Going to miss this' (left) and 'Game time nutcracker on the last day of 2012' (right)

Womack told the Los Angeles Times: 'One person told me bluntly: 'Joy, the 
starting fee, even for an appearance in small variations, is $10,000 
just to show that you are serious.''

The star, who started dancing at the tender age of three, said she heard that another dancer gave someone else in the academy a Mercedes Benz to get a part.

And the American teenager claimed that a teacher mentioned that she should get 'a sponsor who could make gifts and presents on your behalf.'

Womack said she was consistently passed over for parts at the the theater, and left isolated. 'I realized I was a kind of invisible person, a virtual dancer,' she told the LA Times.

It has been very difficult year for the Bolshoi. Sergei Filin, the ballet's artistic director, was hospitalized for months after he was attacked in the face with acid by a mystery assailant.

Dancer Pavel Dmitrichenko is currently in court accused of masterminding the acid attack on Filin.

Filin lost most of the sight in one eye and 20 percent in the other when an masked man threw acid in his face as he returned home on January 17.

Former ballet star Dmitrichenko is on trial for allegedly organizing the attack, along with ex-convict Yuri Zarutsky, who is suspected of carrying out the assault.

Dmitrichenko had claimed he was passed over for the best parts in the theater.

Womack is devastated at leaving the academy, describing the departure as 'like breaking up with your first love.' Her accusations were supported by some members of the academy.

Dancer Natalia Vyskubenko told the LA Times: 'Some people get parts and positions in one way, some in another. What Joy is telling you is not far from reality.'

Yet others reacted with anger and indignation. Soloist Alexander Petukhov told the paper. 'I have worked with the company for 28 years now and I am not aware of such facts.

'If she knows something, let her name those people. Why smear the theater like that?'

But scandal has long been endemic behind the cream-colored, eight-columned facade close to Red Square.

The Bolshoi reopened to great fanfare in 2011 after a $700-million, six-year renovation that restored the theater's opulent tsarist beginnings, doused its interior in gold-leaf and introduced cutting-edge acoustics.

The theater's history is laced with tales of tricks to put off rivals: needles left in costumes; crushed glass in ballet shoes; an alarm clock timed to go off during a particularly intense dance sequence; even a dead cat thrown on stage.

Management of the theater has also seen controversy: in 1995, the departure of the artistic director sparked a wildcat strike by dancers, in turn prompting jeering and foot-stamping from an angry audience that had paid to see 'Romeo and Juliet'.

In 2003, world media had a field day when Bolshoi bosses tried to fire ballerina Anastasia Volochkova for being too heavy.

And in 2011, deputy ballet director Gennady Yanin - then seen as a candidate for the artistic director post - quit after pornographic images of him appeared on the Internet.
