Grant Hackett has broken his silence over the prescription drug dependency that plunged his life into chaos, forcing him to check into a rehabilitation centre for a five-week program. 

The former Olympic champion, who became dependent on the sleeping pill Stilnox, says the 2012 breakdown of his marriage to Candice Alley had taken a 'physical, mental and emotional' toll on the 33-year-old.

Hackett had taken Stilnox at the Crown Casino in Melbourne on Friday 21 February when he was photographed in his underwear and with a singlet pulled down around his waist in the hotel's reception. Witnesses at the time described the swimmer as appearing disorientated, and said the he was asking if anyone had seen his four-year-old son, Jagger. Hackett also had Jagger's twin sister Charlize with him.

Describing the events that led to the incident, Hackett says he had visited a doctor who'd prescribed him sleeping pills because he felt like, ‘the wheels were falling off’. 

‘I had seen a doctor because I needed a rest, I was exhausted,’ he told The Sunday Telegraph. ‘There was so much on my plate and the wheels were falling off.

‘I wasn't getting any sleep. I’d sleep for 45 minutes and wake up and need to do something for a couple of hours and then go back to sleep and I was anxious and sleep-deprived... so he gave me the Stilnox.

'The first time I’d taken it in quite some time was that Friday night.

'I sleep in my singlet and briefs so that’s what I was wearing. Then I jumped into the lift, it was empty, and as I was going down I thought: "Jeez, I’m not going to walk out into the foyer", so I took off my singlet and wrapped it around me, put Charlize down, and there was a security guard right near the lift. I yelled out to him and he came over and I told him what was going on and it was literally minutes and they found (Jagger), on a different floor.

'I was disorientated. I definitely was. That medication was still affecting me at that point because I didn't take it until late in the evening.' 

It later emerged the 33-year-old had developed a reliance on the powerful sleeping pill during the latter stages of his swimming career.

He said the public scrutiny following the breakdown of his marriage had seen him 'white-knuckling' for more than a year, before he finally admitted he needed help.

This week he completed an intensive five-week stint in an Arizona treatment facility. He'll now move in with his parents for a unspecified period of 'supervision' as Hackett adjusts to normal life again.

'I’d been talking to my mum and dad and I’d said things to dad for probably 12 months prior to that saying I don’t feel like I’m coping that well anymore with so many different elements of my life and being on my own,' he told The Sunday Telegraph.

'It was really difficult and I was white knuckle all the time, and I’d always push myself through it and physically, mentally, emotionally it really started to take its toll on me.'

Hackett blamed the toughness instilled in him as an Olympic athlete for the delay in seeking help. He said he had been trained to never reveal a weakness, and it was a mentality that stayed with him long after his Olympic career ended. 

‘I've been an athlete since I was four years old and every moment from there on ’til I was 28 was about pushing through, overcoming, push the pain away, get on with it,' he said. 

‘But when it came to something emotional, you just learnt to suppress it. To actually stop and assess for a second, you didn't do it. You just get on with it and just execute what you have to do and you kind of get to a point where you probably can’t keep going like that. It’s unsustainable. 

‘I was of that psychology in every part of my life. That was my approach and it’s probably good as an athlete, but not so good in every other part of your life.’
