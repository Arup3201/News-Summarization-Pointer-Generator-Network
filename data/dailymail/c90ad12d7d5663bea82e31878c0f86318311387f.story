A newspaper columnist has sparked outrage after suggesting that the deaths of six children in a house fire was 'an accident waiting to happen'.

Carole Malone appeared on This Morning where she said the Derby tragedy may have been a result of the family being targeted as a result of resentment from other people.

She said: 'This was an accident waiting to happen. There's a lot of resentment out there for families exactly like this, especially now, especially with the country in the state that it's in, there's not much money and people have seen families maybe like this one taking advantage.'

Carole Malone said on This Morning that there was a lot of resentment for the Philpott family

Grief-stricken: Mick and Mairead Philpott, the parents of six children that died following a fire at their home in Derby last week, appeared at a news conference yesterday

Mick and Mairead Philpott were inconsolable yesterday during a press conference about the house fire

Her comments were met with anger on Twitter with one user known only as Ellen saying: 'Carole Malone fails at empathy, sensitivity, decency and humanity. 6 children burned to death. Stem your hatred for a few minutes.'

Ms Malone added: 'This family became a target a couple of years ago and I suspect they have many enemies out there because they were seen to be on benefits, they were seen to be asking for a bigger council house and I think they upset a lot of people at the time.'

She was speaking the morning after the fire claimed its sixth victim, 13-year-old Duwayne Philpott, who succumbed to his injuries over the weekend.

His parents, Mick and Mairead, broke down in tears yesterday as police confirmed that an arsonist had started the blaze and petrol had been poured through the family's letterbox.

Jade Philpott, ten, and brothers John, nine, Jack, seven,  Jessie, six, and Jayden, five, all perished as flames and smoke engulfed their council house in Derby.

Mr Philpott's actions were praised by Schofield who was echoing comments by Ann Widdecombe who said that he did what he could to save his children's lives.

When Schofield pointed out that accelerants had been used so it didn't appear to have been an accident, Malone responded by suggesting the family had brought it on themselves.

She said: 'I mean the culture of the family and the fact that they consistently did interviews about their situation. They did bring attention to themselves. The tragedy; this is what's happened. Six innocent children have died as a result.'

On YouTube, user Thibor65 wrote: 'This is despicable! No one, Whether rich or poor, employed or unemployed deserves to lose a child, let alone 6! This "person", I use the term loosely as any normal thinking person would think "Is this comment going to hurt people that are grieving?", is abhorrent.'

There were people who agreed with Malone, however, with Lee Hadfield from Leeds saying: 'I can't help but think that Carole Malone might be right about the comments she made on @itvthismorning'

Distancing themselves from Malone's comments, a spokesman for This Morning said: 'The views expressed in the This Morning newspaper review on Monday were those of Carol Malone and not shared by ITV or This Morning.

'Our thoughts are with the family and all those affected by this tragedy at this difficult time.'

Today it emerged hundreds of people are to join hands in a mile-long human chain to help pay for the children's funerals.

The fund-raiser will see 1,600 people each pay £1 for the funerals, which are due to take place at Derby Cathedral on a date yet to be fixed.

The funerals were originally due to be held at a local Roman Catholic church, but have been moved to the cathedral because of the large number of people who want to pay their respects

The Philpotts want each coffin to arrive at the cathedral in a horse-drawn hearse.

A series of events have been organised by the local community in support of the family.

Anthony Slater, who is co-ordinating the events, said: 'The response from the community has been nothing short of overwhelming.

'Quite often people keep themselves to themselves but this tragic event has helped unite them in their grief and support for Mick and Mairead.

'Everyone in the area knows Mick, Mairead and the children and everyone knows how much he loved not just his own children but other people’s children too.'

Mr Slater said hundreds of people from across the world had offered to help raise money for the funerals and surviving family members.

The human chain event will take place on Tuesday, June 5; starting at the Philpott family home where the blaze took place and finishing at a local park.

Other fund-raising events include a 16-mile walk ending in Derby city centre.

Local schools are allowing children to come to school without wearing their uniforms tomorrow to raise money for a trust set up to help the Philpotts.

Police are yet to establish who started the fire that killed the six children or what their motive was but said yesterday they were ruling no one out.

One line of inquiry is that the family was targeted because of its ‘celebrity status’.

Mr Philpott, a father of 17 children by five women, became known as ‘Shameless Mick’ in 2007 after demanding a larger house to share with his wife, his girlfriend Lisa, and eight of  his offspring.

When asked if Mr and Mrs  Philpott would be quizzed as  suspects, officers refused to comment.

Appearing at a press conference yesterday, Mr Philpott, 54, repeatedly broke down in tears while describing the events of last Thursday night and thanking the authorities for their efforts in trying to save his children.

Mr and Mrs Philpott are believed to have been sleeping downstairs when petrol was poured through the letterbox of their three-bedroom council house and ignited with a match or a cigarette lighter.

The fire then funnelled upstairs, with smoke filling the rooms where the children were sleeping.

Respect: Well-wishers have left hundreds of cards, flowers, teddy bears and candles after a candlelit vigil

Mr and Mrs Philpott were woken by a smoke alarm but ‘valiant’ attempts to save the children were unsuccessful.

Mr Philpott said: ‘I want to thank my three eldest children because they have helped us cope. And then there’s a young lad who tried to get in the house the same as myself.

‘Then of course there is the four firemen, the police, the ambulances, the doctors and nurses – everybody who tried to help save our children.

‘We can’t express our gratitude enough. It’s not just us that have suffered, it’s them as well – it’s everybody.’

Mr Philpott said that his son Duwayne’s organs had been donated to save the life of another child.

‘That makes us happy and it takes a bit of the pain away,’ he added.

‘We grew up in a community that’s been through a lot of problems with violence and to see this community come together like it has, it’s too overwhelming.

'Those poor gentlemen from the fire  brigade, who saw what we saw – my heart goes out to them.’

Steve Cotterill, Assistant Chief Constable at Derbyshire Police, said: ‘The seat of the fire was inside the front door below the letterbox and there are clear indications petrol was used as an accelerant to light the fire.

‘The consequence was the fire took hold and smoke went upstairs to where the children were sleeping. Tragically, those children died of smoke inhalation.’

Mr Cotterill added that authorities were ‘not ruling anybody out’ as suspects.

Mr and Mrs Philpott are yet to be questioned fully because it would have been ‘utterly inappropriate’ so soon after the tragedy, he said.

Mr Philpott’s former mistress, Lisa Willis, 28, and her brother-in-law Ian Cousins, 38, had  been arrested on suspicion of murder before being released without charge.

Miss Willis shared the home in Allenton with Mr and Mrs Philpott until they fell out two months ago. She is in a custody battle with Mr Philpott over their five children.
