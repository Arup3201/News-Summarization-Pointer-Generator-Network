Corey wrote a post on his Facebook page explaining his different way of exercising after some negative backlash about his fun routine.

'Everyone is entitled to there [sic] opinion but when I dance I'm not on drugs! I dance for exercise and keep fit for footy. And btw I don't have disability. Anyone who knows me would know that. F*** the haters,' the post says.

'Bakground to this Lad is, this is His thing. Running His lokal streets on a daily basis, headphones on & dancing while jogging for exercise!' the post says.

'Respekt to You Mate! Ignoring this karload of gronks & doing Your thing!'

Hektor told Daily Mail Australia that when he first saw the video he immediately thought 'what a legend'.

'He's just a really awesome kid who is just loving life,' he said.
