Horrified onlookers watched as a Department of Water and Power employee flung a cat 15 feet to the ground - just moments after he rescued the animal from the top of a power pole.

The cat had been stranded on the top of the pole for three days in the Sunland neighbourhood of Los Angeles when the worker was raised from a bucket truck in an attempt to rescue it.

A video of the incident shows the worker holding the cat dangling out the bucket as it is slowly lowered. But around 15 feet from the ground, the worker suddenly throws the animal loose.

'Get out of the way, get out of the way,' he shouts, before dropping the cat.

A witness told KTLA he was 'astonished' to see the bizarre end to the rescue mission, especially after the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power worker had initially been 'real gentle' with the cat.

'He coaxed it over to him' he said. 'He got it in the bucket. He started coming back down … and he stopped about halfway.'

The cat landed on the ground and quickly ran off, while a woman who was waiting below with a blanket can be heard shouting, 'No, no, no, no!'

Another witness asks the worker: 'Couldn't you have come down a little lower?'

The worker responded: 'Sorry, but he was really clawing me up there.'

When questioned about the incident, Joe Ramallo with the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power told KTLA: 'This cat was up on the pole for days. The crew member said the cat was scratching him. It appears the crew member did everything to rescue the cat, and he did rescue the cat.'
