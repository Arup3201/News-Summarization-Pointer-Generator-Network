Louis van Gaal claimed Manchester United’s fighting spirit will take them back into the top four after Robin van Persie’s last minute equaliser against Chelsea at Old Trafford.

But the United boss criticised his striker’s ‘stupid’ reaction in ripping off his shirt after scoring the goal, earning him a booking.

The home side were seconds away from their third defeat this season when Van Persie smashed the ball home beyond 10-man Chelsea’s defence, the first goal of the Van Gaal era in what used to be known as ‘Fergie Time’.

Didier Drogba had put Chelsea ahead after 53 minutes, but Jose Mourinho was furious when Branislav Ivanovic was sent off by referee Phil Dowd in added time for a second bookable offence.

Van Gaal said: ‘Chelsea tried to kill the game, they made the pitch big and we had to run a lot but we fought till the end.

‘When we scored it was deserved. We created a lot of chances - far more than Chelsea.

Van Persie reacted quickest to fire the ball past Thibaut Courtois to make it 1-1

‘Chelsea created one chance in the first half, but it was a lack of communication that led to their goal. After they scored we lost our heads, but we played very, very well.’

Van Gaal admitted he was furious with Van Persie for ripping his shirt off after scoring. ‘It was a stupid reaction after the goal,’ he said. ‘I can see he was excited but after he was booked it was not so smart.’

Mourinho was angry with Dowd after he booked six Chelsea players and sent off Ivanovic for bringing down Angel di Maria.

Jose Mourinho looks frustrated as he leaves the pitch at the end of the game 

Chelsea will now be fined a mandatory £25,000 for picking up five bookings and Ivanovic will miss the Capital One Cup match against Shrewsbury.

Mourinho said: ‘When five “flash” interviews ask me about the sending-off it is obvious why. I cannot speak about the decisions, even though it was a mistake, because you know what happens when I speak.

‘I speak about the game and it was a good game, but it was a good Manchester United. In Van Gaal they have one of the best managers in the world and they are in great hands.

‘In the same way I had to build, I will not be so lucky. I won’t get five, 10 or 15 years to do it.’
