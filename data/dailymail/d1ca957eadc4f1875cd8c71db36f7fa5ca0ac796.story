A British man has appeared in court in Dubai accused of getting drunk and running naked through a building on the Palm Jumeirah.

The 33-year-old tourist, identified as RS, was said to have entered the reception of the building on the Palm Jumeirah in his underwear after consuming eight rums.

He was then allegedly seen by a security guard naked in a corridor on the second floor of the apartment block, Dubai Court of Misdemeanours has heard today.

The man has been charged with consuming alcohol without a licence and committing an indecent act.

He denies committing an indecent act but admits drinking alcohol.

The court today heard how it took police 30 minutes to talk him from his hiding place on December 20, according to The National.

It was reported that a Nepali security guard, identified as NT, 34, said he noticed the defendant arguing with other security guards, dressed only in his underwear, when he started his shift.

He said the tourist pushed him aside and ran to the second floor of the building after he tried to calm him down.

He said: 'I called our control room to contact police and then I followed him to the second floor, where I found that he had taken off his underwear and stood there in the brightly lit corridor, completely naked.'

RS is reported to have said he was unable to remember anything because he 'was too drunk'.

He had allegedly been drinking at Le Meridien Mina Sey hotel before returning to the Shoreline, on the Palm, where he was staying.

The next hearing is due to be held on March 27.

It is the latest in a string of court cases involving Britons in Dubai, home to a significant British resident population and a popular holiday spot.

Foreign residents in Dubai must have a licence to legally drink alcohol in the Gulf emirate.

Officials in the Gulf state have prosecuted several British tourists for indecent behaviour and for swearing in public over the past few years.
