An Alabama woman got more than she bargained for after she tried to clear toilet paper from her yard by setting it on fire and accidently burned down her house.

Cheryl Crausewell's home and yard in Dora were TP'd by neighborhood kids on Saturday and the nightmare began when she and her son tried to quickly clear the paper from a tree with fire on Monday.

A bit of the flaming toilet paper leaped from the tree, charred most of her yard, whipped around to a backyard barbecue propane tank and eventually engulfed the entire home.

Crausewell suspects the propane tank may have exploded, contributing to the blaze.

Seemed like a good idea: An Alabama homeowner whose house and yard were covered in toilet paper by neighborhood pranksters and tried cleaning it up with fire has burned her house down. Bits of the toilet paper can still be seen at left

Crausewell told WBRC she was just trying to get rid of a tiny bit stuck to a magnolia tree when the fire quickly escalated.

'It just popped out into a little patch and we tried to put it out and it just kept going, so I was trying to keep it from going down the front porch and came down the bank and around the back of the house,' she said.

Unfortunately, she wasn't able to get a handle on the flames and as she rushed to get her mother, elderly aunt and her aunt's caregiver out of the home she called the fire department.

Charred: Shocking footage shows the extent of the blaze, which charred most of Crausewell's yard on its path toward the family home

'It just popped out into a little patch and we tried to put it out and it just kept going, so I was trying to keep it from going down the front porch and came down the bank and around the back of the house,' said Crausewell

Crausewell told WBRC that firefighters arrived to the scene extremely quickly, but the speed of the flames made them too late.

The home, where the family had spent the last 12 years, was a total loss.

'A lot of memories. You know, my son was about a year and a half when we moved here and he doesn't really remember living anywhere else, and this is where we thought we would be for a long time, long time,' she said.

Thankful: Firefighters rushed to the scene, but were unable to control the flames before the house was engulfed. Crausewell's son, mother, her elderly aunt and the aunt's nurse were all able to escape

Helping the family out were their church and the American Red Cross. Even the mayor stopped by to show his support.

Crausewell has homeowner's insurance she thinks will cover the damage.

Right now, though, she's focused on the truly important things in life.

'I just realize life is really precious. I mean, you know that already but it just brings it home how precious life is and all these things really don't matter,' she said.

Total loss: The home was gutted but Crausewell said she has homeowner's insurance and plans to rebuild on the same spot. 'I just realize life is really precious,' said Crausewell
