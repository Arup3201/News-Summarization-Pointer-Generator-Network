Kim Major, 48, claims she has been handed a 'death sentence' after doctors failed to spot she had cancer 25 times

A mother-of-two claims she has been handed a 'death sentence' after doctors failed to spot she had cancer 25 times – and even advised her to see a psychiatrist for her 'anxiety'.

Kim Major, 48, has now launched a medical negligence lawsuit against the surgery, claiming the year-long delay in diagnosing her terminal lung cancer left her with just six months to live.

She has now been told she's unlikely to spend another Christmas with her son Lewis, 13, and daughter Roxanne, 31, because the tumours have spread from her lungs to her brain and liver.

During one visit to Fitznells Manor Surgery in Epsom, Surrey, she was turned away and told she had a virus and on another occasion she was advised to see a psychiatrist for her 'anxiety'.

'I just feel totally abandoned by the people I should have been able to trust to care for me. It's just so awful for the family, it's ripped our hearts out,' she told the Sunday Mirror.

'I could not believe what I was hearing when I was told I had lung cancer but to make matters worse it had been left undiagnosed for long it had spread to my lymph nodes and to my brain.'

'Each day I'm grateful to wake up. My son thinks chemotherapy is going to mend me.

'But I know the medicine might let me down. It's heart-breaking to tell your children you might not be here next year. I feel like I've been given a death sentence.'

She first visited the surgery in September 2013 complaining of recurring headaches, dizziness, coughing, chest and neck pain.

It was only when the 48-year-old had X-rays and blood tests in A&E after struggling to breathe that she discovered she had terminal lung cancer.

Doctors found a tumour on her lung, two tumours in her brain and two in her liver. 

'I do not know how long I have left but my condition is deteriorating and I am worried for my son who will be left without his mum,' she said.

'I am struggling to come to terms with my diagnosis and what the future has in store for me.' 

Her lawyer Richard Kayser, from Irwin Mitchell Solicitors, said: 'Kim's diagnosis has come as a complete shock to her and her family and they are desperately seeking answers as to why her condition was not picked up at an earlier point.'

A spokesman for Fitznells Manor Surgery said: 'The surgery was saddened to hear of this case and our thoughts go to the family. Due to patient confidentiality, we are unable to comment further.'

An NHS England Surrey and Sussex spokesman said it would be 'inappropriate to comment further due to legal proceedings'.
