A British man has been kidnapped by armed gunmen shortly after arriving in Nigeria, it emerged today.

Gunmen attacked a four-wheel drive car at 
around 7.30pm GMT on Tuesday after it left Lagos airport's 
international terminal.

Security sources say the man was returning to a 
residential area of Lagos when he was taken. The Nigerian driver of the vehicle was shot but survived.

The British High Commission (BHM) said in a statement today: 'The
BHM is working closely with others to secure the release of the 
hostage.

'Because of 
the nature of this incident, the BHM is not going into further detail 
about it.'

Many major companies with British connections operate in 
Nigeria including oil giant Royal Dutch Shell, British Airways, Unilever 
and PricewaterhouseCoopers.

it is not known where the 
kidnapped man was employed.

A Foreign and Commonwealth Office spokesman said it was working with authorities in Nigeria.

The spokesman said: 'We are aware of reports of a missing person and are liaising with Nigerian authorities.'

A spokesman for the British 
Consulate-General, Wale Adebayo, said diplomats are working with 
Nigerian authorities on the kidnapping.

He would not say what day it occurred or give any other information, citing the 'sensitive nature' of the issue.

Kidnapping of expatriates by armed gangs 
seeking ransom has long been rife in Nigeria's oil producing southeast 
but is rarer in Lagos where most foreigners live.

A British 
businessman was kidnapped in March in an upmarket district of Nigeria's 
commercial capital but was released four days later. It was not clear if
a ransom was paid.

In Nigeria's mainly Muslim north, kidnappings of 
foreigners for ideological motives by Islamist groups have taken a 
deadlier turn.

Islamist group Ansaru killed seven foreign hostages in 
March, authorities from some of the affected countries said.

Kidnappings for ransom are relatively common in oil-rich Nigeria - both of foreigners and wealthy Nigerians.

The son of a state legislator and four Chinese nationals in two different states all have been reported kidnapped this month.

Some cases are not reported because of fears for the safety of the hostages.

Most are released unharmed after ransoms have been paid, though people have been injured and killed if they resist.
