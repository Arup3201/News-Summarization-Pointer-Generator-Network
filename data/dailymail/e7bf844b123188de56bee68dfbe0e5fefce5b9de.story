David Villa has been spotted having a medical in Manchester ahead of his high-profile move to Man City's US franchise New York City FC.

The Atletico Madrid forward is reportedly close to confirming a deal with the American outfit, which comes to fruition in next year's MLS season.

The Spain international, caught on camera at the city's Bridgewater Hospital by the Manchester Evening News, would be NYCFC's first major signing.

Signing Villa would prove the Sky Blues' US counterparts mean business, despite soccer not being the most popular sport in America.

The forward, however, would not be eligible to play for Man City before the MLS, which is currently half way through its current campaign, begins.

Villa, having amassed 13 goals last season en route to the La Liga title, is preparing to go to the World Cup with Spain.
