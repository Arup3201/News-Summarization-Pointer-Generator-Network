Killed driving to work: Kathryn Bartlett was overjoyed about getting the all clear after her ovarian cancer battle but was killed in a car crash days later

A devoted mother was killed by a van driver who fell asleep at the wheel just days after she was given the all clear from ovarian cancer.

Kathryn Bartlett, 44, was overjoyed and looking forward to getting on with her life after undergoing chemotherapy and radiation treatment for two years since her diagnosis in 2010.

But while heading to work in Cardiff her car was struck by Nathan Cleaver's Peugeot van as he drove back after working a night shift 100 miles away.

Cleaver, 22, drove across the carriageway into oncoming traffic at Abercynon, South Wales, in January this year, Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court heard.

Mrs Bartlett suffered multiple injuries in the crash and was pronounced dead at Prince Charles Hospital in Merthyr Tydfil, where she had been battling cancer and was given the all clear just before Christmas last year.

Mother-of-one Mrs Bartlett, an administration worker, was travelling to work at 6.40am when her Astra Estate collided with Cleaver’s van.

Prosecutor Rachel Knight told how witnesses described how he made no attempt to brake on a bend and went straight across the carriageway into oncoming traffic.

She said: ‘There was no chance for her to avoid the collision.’

Cleaver had been working as a railway contractor more than 100 miles away in Oxford and had left there at 4.30am to drive home in Cwmaman, near Aberdare, South Wales.

Multiple injuries: Mrs Bartlett was pronounced dead at at Prince Charles Hospital in Merthyr Tydfil, the same hospital where she had been battling cancer and given the all clear just before Christmas last year

Miss Knight said: ‘Cleaver had worked from midnight to 4am on the morning of the crash.

‘Mrs Bartlett was driving safely and carefully and well within the 50mph limit but the evidence shows that Cleaver was not doing the same.

‘There was nothing she could have done.’

William Cordingly, defending Cleaver, said: ‘He is extremely remorseful about what happened.’

Jailing Cleaver for 10 months, Judge Dan Williams paid tribute to Kathryn.

Jailed: Nathan Cleaver was jailed for 10 months for the crash. Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court (pictured) heard that he was 'extremely remorseful about what happened'

He said: ‘Mrs Bartlett was 44 years old, a devoted wife, loving sister, prized daughter and doting mother.

‘In that terrible moment not only was a life so full of promise ended but the lives of those many people close to her were changed forever.’

Her husband John said after her death: ‘She was a wonderful mother.

‘Kathryn would help anyone and everyone. She was always smiling and there is a Kathryn-shaped hole in our hearts without her.’
