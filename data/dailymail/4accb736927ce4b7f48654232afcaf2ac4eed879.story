The worlds of golf and motor racing will meet in the United Arab Emirates next week for the season’s finale of the European Tour and Formula One respectively.

But while one sport frets about how a distorted points distribution in the final grand prix might affect the overall outcome, the other is left to reflect on how the lack of such contrivance means its race is already effectively run.

Rory McIlroy could claim title without swinging a club after sensational year

It’s an interesting one, isn’t it? Do you go the route of F1 and the PGA Tour with its FedEx Cup to ensure it all comes down to the final event? Or the European Tour route, which risks the final tournament, as it will be this year, becoming a 72-hole coronation?

Certainly you can understand the angst that will be on show amid the racing fraternity in Abu Dhabi. It does seem wrong that the most important prize in the sport might be decided by a gimmick.

But the Dubai World Championship? Couldn’t we have done with a gimmick to ensure the Race to Dubai is still a race when everyone gets there? 

Second-placed Jamie Donaldson must win last two tournaments to have any chance of claiming bonus

At the moment you’ve got the season concluding with four strong tournaments known as the Final Series. To be fair, the points totals for each event have been tweaked to try to ensure a big finish but the fact is nothing that happened in the first two events in China has made a blind bit of difference. 

Rory McIlroy began with a lead of just over three million points and, despite playing in neither, ends them with an advantage of just under three million.

What’s the point of linking four tournaments together if so little change takes place? Where’s the incentive to make sure everyone turns up when the leader can miss the first three events and still be miles in front going into the last one?

Lewis Hamilton’s dramatic duel in Formula One with Nico Rosberg will go to the final race

This week’s Turkish Airlines Open is a good event in its own right but it ought to be a pivotal tournament in terms of building the excitement towards Dubai. Yet even if second-placed Jamie Donaldson were to win it, there would still be no pressure on McIlroy for top spot.

Maybe this is how it should be, given the truly spectacular year the Northern Irishman has enjoyed. But, in that case, why go along with the pretence of a Final Series? If you’re keen for a four-tournament grand finale, surely the format has to reflect the fact?

Who’s got it right between F1 and the European Tour? Right now, it is tempting to think... neither.

Matteo mirrors past mistakes

Over the past five years, gifted Italian Matteo Manassero has rewritten the record books when it comes to being the youngest to reach a landmark.

Among the highlights are: youngest player to win the British Amateur; youngest to win the silver medal at The Open; youngest to win on the European Tour; youngest player to make the halfway cut at the Masters, and youngest to win the tour’s flagship event.

Now, however, comes one he could have done without: youngest player to suffer such a precipitous decline. What on earth has happened to him? 18 months ago he was on the cusp of the world’s top 20. Now he’s outside the top 120 and never came close to making Europe’s Ryder Cup team. 

Matteo Manassero finished 76th out of 78 In his last outing in Shanghai at the BMW Masters

Following an encouraging 19th place at The Open he has played in seven events with four missed halfway cuts and a best finish of tied 47th for the princely earnings, from the middle of July, of £23,000. In his last outing in Shanghai at the BMW Masters he concluded with a final round of 80 to finish 76th in a field of 78.

‘After playing in the majors and seeing the length of the courses, Matteo has been working on his swing to hit the ball further but unfortunately at the moment it has taken its toll on his results,’ explained his manager, Gorka Guillen. Manassero is not one of the power players and probably does need to find some length. And at just 21, he’s the right age to try.

But let’s hope he does not end up as yet another lost soul who is so bewitched by the big hitters that he loses sight of his own strengths.

Quote of the week

‘The Tour is in a very strong position now and that is why I have the confidence to move aside.’

After 40 years with the European Tour, chief executive George O’Grady announced last week he is standing down. 

The 65-year-old is certainly quitting at the top, following the most successful playing season in the tour’s history, with three of the four majors in European hands plus the Ryder Cup. 

It is also one where the top 25 in the Race to Dubai will all make in excess of £1million, and the top 10 more than £2m.
