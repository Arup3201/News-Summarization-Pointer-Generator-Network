All 20million families with internet connections are to be forced within months to say whether they want access to online pornography.

Hundreds of thousands are already signing up to have it blocked.

A scheme to combat the tide of web sleaze that is corroding childhood has been dramatically accelerated, David Cameron told the Daily Mail last night.

Speaking ahead of a Downing Street summit with online giants next week, the Prime Minister revealed that huge numbers of households have already opted for family-friendly filters.

Blocks: Internet service providers will ask families to make a yes or no choice on access to pornography over the next few months (posed by model)

Two of the major internet service providers, TalkTalk and Sky, are now telling all new customers they have an unavoidable choice on whether the filters, which block all pornographic sites, should be switched on or off. Virgin and BT will confirm on Monday that they are to follow suit in January.

Over the next few months, existing internet users will also be contacted by service providers and told they must make a similar choice.

New customers who set up a broadband account or switch providers are to have the filters automatically selected unless they opt to disable them. Customers who do not click on either option – accepting or declining – will have filters activated by default.

The filters will apply to all devices linked to a home wi-fi network and across any public network, such as those that can be accessed from shops and public spaces, wherever children are likely to be present.

Adult content filters are also expected to be fitted to all new mobile phones automatically.

Action: Prime Minister David Cameron  has said web firms have a 'moral duty' to take action over porn

Only an adult will be able to change the filter settings and the account holder will receive a confirmation email. Some providers are also offering text alerts, in case children hack into the account.

The UK’s biggest internet service providers, which are responsible for internet connections in about 95 per cent of homes, have agreed to sign up to the scheme after months of discussion with the Government.

The Daily Mail has campaigned to make family-friendly filters ‘default on’ to help protect a generation of children.

There has been growing alarm at evidence that a third of youngsters have accessed online pornography by the time they are ten years old.

Six in ten parents say they are worried or very worried about their sons and daughters seeing violent and sexual material on the web.

Mr Cameron has argued that web firms have a ‘moral duty’ to act but have not been ‘doing enough to take responsibility’.

 He said: ‘I made a promise in July that I would take action to help parents protect their children when online at home and we are now delivering on that promise.

‘In the weeks and months ahead, millions of hardworking families will only need one click to protect their whole home and to keep their children safe.

‘And when someone sets up a new broadband account, the settings to install family-friendly filters will be automatically selected and it will only be switched off if a parent chooses to do so.

‘As a dad, it is very simple: I want to know my children are protected when they go onto the internet. A family-friendly filter gives me the tool to do that and so this is a really important step forward by the internet service providers.

‘We all need to work together, both to prevent children from accessing pornography and educate them about keeping safe online, and I will continue to ensure this happens.’

Mr Cameron said he will install   filters in his own home to protect his three children, adding: ‘You’re always a few clicks away from something you shouldn’t see.’

Concerns: Six in ten parents say they are worried or very worried about their sons and daughters seeing violent and sexual material on the web (posed by a model)

On Monday, it will also be announced that BT, Sky, TalkTalk and Virgin Media are funding a £25million campaign aimed at advising parents how to tackle issues including cyber-bullying and access to adult content online. The six largest providers of public wi-fi – Arqiva, BT, Sky, Nomad, Virgin Media and 02 – will confirm they have switched on family friendly filters in all areas where children might access the internet.

An updated Brownie badge on computer skills and safety to keep pace with technology and help young girls with the challenges they face online will also be announced.

TalkTalk is working with Girlguiding UK to teach girls about how to make the most of the internet and how best to stay safe online. Dido Harding, of TalkTalk, said: ‘We are now contacting our existing customers to ask them if they want to use [the family-friendly filter] HomeSafe, and we will be pre-ticking HomeSafe as on for new customers from the end of the year.

‘One in three customers are choosing to turn on parental controls, and this equates to 30,000 more homes a week keeping their families safer online as a result.’

Campaigners will welcome the progress, but there is still deep concern about the phenomenon of ‘sexting’ – where children use mobile devices to exchange sexual pictures of each other – which will not be curbed by internet filters.

Critics have also argued that ‘default on’ filters risk giving parents the impression that they can install them and then consider their work is done.

They say faults or loopholes in existing internet service provider filters have been reported and warn that they can unintentionally block important sites related to sexual health and sex education.

A Government source said further work was necessary, but insisted: ‘We’ve acted quickly and decisively to help families with this problem. This is not about censorship or moralising but helping parents make an informed choice.’

÷ Almost a quarter of 11 and 12-year-olds had been distressed by an experience online in the past year, the NSPCC found. It said that, of these, 18 per cent felt upset or scared for weeks afterwards. Its poll of more than 1,000 youngsters also found that a fifth who had been upset by an online incident such as trolling or being sent inappropriate sexual messages, experienced this every day or almost every day.
