The pilot and crew of a National Guard helicopter have been suspended after using their Blackhawk helicopter to drop a stash of candy at a Halloween party.

Video footage from earlier in the week shows the military chopper swooping down over a neighborhood in Phoenix, Arizona, before jettisoning several bundles of sweets.

But though the drop may have added a sugar boost to the festivities below, it also got the crew into trouble with the Arizona national guard, who didn't know about the stunt.

Coming in: Neighbors spoke of their shock as the military chopper came bearing down on their homes, then swooped away after its delivery. The crew has been suspended

The elite crew was headed to a training mission in the Deer Valley suburb of Phoenix, when they made the unscheduled stop to pour out the sweets, incensing their superiors, according to Fox 10.

Neighbors not in on the joke spoke of their terror as they saw the ominous shape in the sky swooping over their homes at a sharp angle. 

After the footage got out, the Arizona National Guard issued a statement saying they had suspended the crew, who have not been named, while they investigate further. 

'Not for personal use': The Arizona National Guard said it would be investigating how the helicopter - worth around $6million - was used in such a way
