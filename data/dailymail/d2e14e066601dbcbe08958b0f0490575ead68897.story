President Obama's approval ratings have hit an all-time low as the continued problems with the health care roll out have forced him to apologize once again for his administration's mistakes.

A new poll by Quinnipiac University revealed on Tuesday that 54 per cent of Americans disapprove of President Obama's job performance while only 39 per cent approve.

Adding to the blow, the latest poll breaks the results down into gender and age demographics, showing that every such group disapproves of the work the President is doing.

New lows: President Obama has never had a 39 per cent approval rating, making this the lowest point yet during his two terms in office

Male and female voters, young and old, rich and poor, all have higher disapproval ratings than approval ratings for the second term president.

'President Obama's job approval rating has fallen to the level of former President George W. Bush at the same period of his Presidency,' Quinnipiac University Polling Institute assistant director Tim Malloy said in the release.

These new figures show that his public perception continues to deteriorate as just two weeks ago he was at an earlier record low, with only 42 per cent approving in an October 30 poll.

The latest hit coincides with the revelation that, in spite of his earlier public promises that anyone who liked their health insurance plan would not be forced to switch, about five per cent of Americans will not be able to retain their current health plans.

'President Obama's misstatement, "If you like your health plan, you can keep it," left a bad taste with a lot of people. Nearly half of the voters, 46 per cent, think he knowingly deceived them,' Mr Malloy said.

The only issue area where voters believe the President is doing a good job is that of handling terrorism, where 52 per cent of respondents think he has done a good job with 42 per cent disapproving of his approach on global terror.

Keeping his head up: President Obama, seen here on Tuesday with service members and vice President Joe Biden (blocked in view but sitting two seats to the left of Obama), has tried apologizing for the health care roll out to no avail

The Quinnipiac poll offers break outs on his handling of foreign policy, immigration, the economy, health care and the federal budget- all of which came out with deficits.

In spite of the opposition to the Affordable Care Act, the biggest gap between disapproval and approval came from in the federal budget arena, with 62 per cent disapproving his handling of the issue and 32 per cent approving.

The latest Quinnipiac poll focuses solely on President Obama, but when the previous Wall Street Journal/NBC poll was released on October 30 he was not the only one facing plummeting numbers.

Republicans were also feeling the backlash from voters as the government shutdown was still fresh in their minds. The GOP felt the heat with an all-time-low of 22 per cent approval rating and 53 per cent disapproval.

Numbers continue to plummet for the President as his approval rating was two points higher just two weeks ago

@highlight

Now every surveyed group of voter- male, female, old, young, rich, poor- disapproves of his job performance

@highlight

Change comes after he admitted that his previous statements- saying 'anyone that wants to keep their health insurance will be able to'- were false

@highlight

He now has the same approval rating as former President George W Bush at the same time in his second term
