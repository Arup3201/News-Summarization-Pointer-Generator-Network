A nation is questioning how intelligence agencies failed to stop the Tsarnaev brothers from allegedly launching a terrorist attack on Boston Marathon runners, even after they were outspoken on their extreme views on various social media platforms.

Older brother Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, who was killed Thursday night in a shootout with police, was interviewed by the FBI in 2011 after a foreign government, later identified as Russia, alerted U.S. authorities that he could have possible ties to extremists and radical Islamists. 

The surviving ethnic Chechen brother, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 19, is being treated at a hospital in Boston for critical injuries. A Twitter page identified by several news outlets to be his is full of cryptic messages like, ‘We try to find ways to kill time but time kills us.’

The Tsarnaevs, who have been named by the FBI as the two suspects for last Monday’s deadly bombings at the Boston Marathon, both had a fairly active social presence. 

Relatives said that Tamerlan was something of a ‘black sheep’ in the family and seemed to grow more radical and devout beginning around 2009. An avid boxer, he spent much of his time training in the gym. Despite working with other athletes, he said in 2010 that he had ‘a single American friend’ and didn’t ‘understand’ Americans. 

His YouTube page, which was created in August 2012, had playlists created on radical Islamism.

Speaking with Reuters, a U.S. law enforcement source said that because the 2011 dealings with Tamerlan did not produce any ‘derogatory’ information, the matter was ‘put to bed.’

Certain statutes do not allow dead-end cases within the FBI to remain open, according to CBS News.

The FBI, which first denied that it had spoken with Tamerlan, said yesterday in a statement: ‘In response to this 2011 request, the FBI checked U.S. government databases and other information to look for such things as derogatory telephone communications, possible use of online sites associated with the promotion of radical activity, associations with other persons of interest, travel history and plans, and education history. 

Friends told several media outlets that this Twitter feed was that of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev; his last tweet was from April 17

The two individuals believed to be responsible for the Boston Marathon bombings on Monday have been positively identified as Tamerlan Tsarnaev, now deceased, and Dzhokar Tsarnaev, now in custody. These individuals are brothers and residents of Massachusetts. Tamerlan Tsarnaev was a legal permanent resident and Dzhokar Tsarnaev is a naturalized U.S. citizen.

Charges have not yet been filed against Dzhokar Tsarnaev and he is presumed innocent.

Tamerlan Tsarnaev, age 26, was previously designated as Suspect 1, wearing a black hat. Dzhokar A. Tsarnaev, age 19, was designated as Suspect 2, wearing a white hat. Both were born in Kyrgyzstan.

Once the FBI learned the identities of the two brothers today, the FBI reviewed its records and determined that in early 2011, a foreign government asked the FBI for information about Tamerlan Tsarnaev.

The request stated that it was based on information that he was a follower of radical Islam and a strong believer, and that he had changed drastically since 2010 as he prepared to leave the United States for travel to the country’s region to join unspecified underground groups.

In response to this 2011 request, the FBI checked U.S. government databases and other information to look for such things as derogatory telephone communications, possible use of online sites associated with the promotion of radical activity, associations with other persons of interest, travel history and plans, and education history. 

The FBI also interviewed Tamerlan Tsarnaev and family members.

The FBI did not find any terrorism activity, domestic or foreign, and those results were provided to the foreign government in the summer of 2011.

The FBI requested but did not receive more specific or additional information from the foreign government.

A spokesperson for the federal agency told MailOnline Saturday evening that the FBI is not releasing any further statements at this time.

An Amazon Wish List, which was first unearthed by Slate, seems to belong to Tamerlan as well. Of the 23 items in the list, many are books on how to create fake driver’s licenses and IDs, as well as history books on conflicts in Chechnya. 

Among the titles are: ‘The Lone Wolf and the Bear: Three Centuries of Chechen Defiance of Russian Rule,’ ‘Organized Crime: An Inside Guide to the World’s Most Successful Industry,’ and ‘How to Win Friends & Influence People.’

It was also revealed that Tamerlan took a flight from New York to Russia in January 2012, and remained there for several months.

Dzhokhar has a profile on VK, the Russian equivalent of Facebook. It says that he lives in Boston and lists his world view as ‘Islam.’

But as the Atlantic Wire notes, what people post as their beliefs on a site like Facebook or Twitter isn’t always indicative of one’s beliefs. 

Friends and classmates of the Tsarnaevs said they found few omens of radicalism in the brothers.

Dzhokhar wrote on March 17: ‘See no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil until the morning alarm goes off and all hell unleashes.’ 

His last tweet, written on April 17, reads: ‘I’m a stress free kind of guy.’

Dzhokhar’s tweets are an amalgamation of irreverent thoughts, blasé observations, and comments, from his thoughts on the TV show ‘Breaking Bad’ to re-tweets from ‘Condescending Willy Wonka.’

April 15: There are people that know the truth but stay silent & there are people that speak the truth but we don’t hear them cuz they’re the minority,’ he wrote at 11:34pm on April 15, hours after the bombing. 

He also tweeted last September that the 9/11 attacks were an inside job. ‘IDK (I don't know) why it’s hard for many of you to accept that,’ he writes.

A tweet from March of last year reads: ‘A decade in America already, I want out.’ This comment was picked apart by other Twitter users following the bombings, with one person writing: ‘ProTip: Come here as a refugee, then blow up a public event…that’s a political statement. It’s terrorism.’

He writes on January 17, 2012: ‘some people are just misunderstood by the world thus the increase of suicide rates.’

In a detailed profile in the Boston Globe, Dzhokhar is described as the son who ‘thrived’ in America, coming to the country from Chechnya when he was either 10 or 11.

A student at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth, he even won a scholarship and was pursuing a major in marine biology.

Relatives across the globe speaking to reporters have expressed their grief that the brothers allegedly committed these acts of terrorism and seem baffled the two could do such a thing.
