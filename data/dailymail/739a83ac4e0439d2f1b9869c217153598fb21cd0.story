West Ham starlet Diego Poyet has joined Huddersfield Town on a short-term loan deal.

Poyet, who is the son of Sunderland manager Gus, will be with the Terriers until December 6, and is available to make his debut in their upcoming Sky Bet Championship clash with Fulham.

The 19-year-old signed a four-year deal with The Hammers in the summer and has already made two Premier League appearances, including starting against Manchester United.

West Ham have high hopes for Poyet who excelled during his short spell at Charlton last season. He made his professional debut for The Addicks in January 2014 and by the end of the season had won their Player of the Year competition. 

Poyet has made appearances for both the England Under 16 and 17 sides, although he does also qualify for Uruguay through his father.

Huddersfield Town manager Chris Powell said: 'Diego is a player I know very well from our time together at Charlton. He is a real talent and adds further quality to our midfield options.

'I have been told that Diego caught the eye of a number of clubs, including Huddersfield Town, following his performances for Charlton, but he's been out of our reach until this opportunity became available.

'He's made his Premier League bow for West Ham and we will give him further Championship experience. I am grateful that the Club has demonstrated a willingness to enhance the squad and move quickly to get the move done.

'Diego is a tenacious midfield player with a great range of passing; he should dovetail brilliantly with our other midfield players at the Club and fit right into the squad in terms of his personality.'

Poyet will wear the number 44 shirt at Huddersfield Town. 

He made his debut for Charlton in January 2014 then went on to win their Player of the Year competition
