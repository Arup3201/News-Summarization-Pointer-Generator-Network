Liverpool have snapped up 20-year-old defender Kevin Stewart, who was released by Tottenham this summer. But, having announced the move on Twitter himself, no-one seems to know that much about the player.

Here, Sportsmail reveals all...

What happened at Spurs for them to let him go?

He signed as a full-time scholar in 2010 when he turned 16 and joined the club with a lot of promise. Youth coaches there had high hopes that he'd push on and break through into the senior team. That was why he was called into first-team squads as a teenager, making the bench for a Europa League game against PAOK in 2011.

Move: Kevin Stewart was released by Tottenham in the summer but has signed for Liverpool

Was there any attitude problem there then?

Not at all, by the sounds of it. One source who knows the player said: 'He was popular amongst his age group and very polite. There were never any issues there, he got on with everyone.'

But why have Liverpool picked up a player deemed not good enough for Spurs?

The key link in all this is Liverpool's Under 21 coach Alex Inglethorpe, who used to be a youth coach at... Spurs. Inglethorpe was at the north London club from 2006-2012 when Brendan Rodgers signed him as part of his coaching staff.

It is thought that Inglethorpe has been instrumental in the signing of Stewart.

What's he like as a player?

Stewart has been described by those who know him as 'energetic' and 'a solid defender' who very rarely makes mistakes but can lapse in concentration at times.

He can play across the back, on the left or right flank or as a centre half. Last season, wearing the No 59 shirt, he was used predominantly as a centre-back. He is 5ft 7ins, so not exactly the tallest of players, and his height would suggest he is more suited to full-back.

Run: Stewart can play on the left, right or in the centre, even though he isn't the tallest at 5ft 7ins

Strength: Stewart is known as 'energetic' and a 'solid defender' that has potential to get better

Did he achieve anything at Spurs?

Stewart was part of the Spurs squad who won the Under 21 Southern League three years ago and was also a regular in the side who beat Liverpool in the quarter-finals of the 2011/12 Next Gen competition.

That will have been another occasion when he came under Liverpool's radar. Earlier in the tournament they also smashed Inter Milan 7-1, with Stewart in the side.
