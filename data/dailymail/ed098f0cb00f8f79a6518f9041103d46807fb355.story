Life takes on a different aspect when you’re dangling by your fingertips more than 300ft up a crane.

Death probably does too, although it doesn’t seem to be something that troubles James Kingston too much.

He’s seldom happier than when balancing on tip-toes at the top of a skyscraper, leaping a gap between buildings, or maybe just hanging out with friends – in every sense – on a precipice.

Dangling daredevil: James Kingston, 22, from Southampton, hangs from a crane 300ft above his home town

Not scared of heights: James gets his highs from scaling tall structures, jumping gracefully over unlikely objects and seeking out athletic challenges through 'urban exploration'

'It's a very safe thing to do': Mr Kingston says that because he is constantly working on his skills he never places himself in a situation where his life is genuinely in danger

And guess what? He’s not scared of 
heights. Yesterday the 22-year-old part-time model, whose video footage 
of his latest escapade has become an international hit on YouTube, 
explained that he scaled the crane (inevitably) because it was there.

‘I
 chose it simply because of how high it is,’ said James. ‘It’s very rare
 to have such high structures in my city so I couldn’t pass off the 
opportunity to climb it and get some awesome shots.’

The crane 
stunt, performed in his home town of Southampton, is just one of a 
series of daredevil feats he has accomplished since becoming a 
‘freerunner’ and practitioner of the modern sport of parkour – in which 
buildings, street furniture and other structures are used as a platform 
for spectacular acrobatic stunts.

Dizzy heights: Mr Kingston has scaled other cranes in Britain, as well as several in Italy. His headiest triumph was a 320ft crane in Los Angeles, from which he also did a one-arm dangle

James photographed hanging from Brighton pier yesterday: 'I don¿t want anyone to copy what I do,' he said. 'It¿s not dangerous for me, because I¿ve devoted my life to it. But for anyone else, it¿s highly dangerous'

‘I don’t just jump straight into crazy things,’ he said. ‘I have never been injured – it’s a very safe thing that I do, because I’m constantly working on techniques and stuff. I wouldn’t hang by one arm off a massive crane if I didn’t know that no matter what, I’d be able to pull myself up again.’

A film of his crane stunt has been put on YouTube with a soundtrack called Don’t Hold Your Breath, by Kota. Someone suggested ‘Would You Like to Swing on a Spar’ might have been more appropriate, but the film had nevertheless clocked up more than 115,000 hits by yesterday.

‘Climbing and going on adventures is my life at the moment,’ he said. ‘I don’t do it for the money. I do it because I have a passion for it.’

Isn’t the crane thing a bit irresponsible though? ‘I don’t want anyone to copy what I do,’ he added. ‘It’s not dangerous for me, because I’ve devoted my life to it. But for anyone else, it’s highly dangerous.’

Last night his mother Julie, 53, said: ‘He could walk when he was nine months old, so I guess I should have known, really.

'When he was two or three, he used to be scared of climbing trees – clearly he’s come a long way.

‘But this isn’t just about him being a bit of a nutter up the top of a crane. He’s totally committed to parkour and he’s starting to teach other people now.’

Does she worry? ‘All the time,’ she said. ‘I’m his mother. But he knows what he’s capable of and I trust his abilities.’

James has worked in several films including summer blockbuster KickAss 2, but his ambition, unsurprisingly, is to become a professional stuntman.

Meanwhile, he lives at home with mum. ‘She’s fully behind me with everything... apart from when I’m hanging from cranes with one arm,’ he said.

‘She doesn’t like that, so I don’t tell her until it’s done.’
