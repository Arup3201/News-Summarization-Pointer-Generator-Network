A hippo has been making a splash in the small beach town of Ponta Do Oura in Mozambique with daily trips to the beach. 

The one-and-a-half ton animal has been seen trotting through the waves and going for a swim, much to the amusement of other beach-goers. 

'Mr Hippo' - as he is known locally - was photographed by 44-year-old marine mammal guide, Angie Gullan who says that she has never seen anything like this before. The hippo spent three days in and out of the surf before moving on his way.

Better than mud: Locals have fondly named this regular visitor to the beach 'Mr Hippo'. He enjoyed a dip in the sea Ponta Do Ouro, Mozambique for three days before moving on

Making waves: The surf proves no problem for this hippopotamus to negotatiate. Mr Hippo has amused locals with his daily dips in the sea

Strong swimmer: The giant animal surprises everyone with his swimming skills amongst the surf and in the open ocean in Ponta Do Ouro

Unusual sight: Hippos, or 'horses of the sea,' are usually found swimming in rivers, lakes and mangrove swamps rather than the open sea

Wallowing: Mr Hippo looks quite at home lying in the froth amongst the ocean waves. His arrival has surprised nature experts who say it is very unusual to see a hippo in the sea 

Paddling: The hippo wanders about in the shallows before going for a proper swim, attracting the attention of bemused locals

Surfs up: The one and a half ton animal can be seen ploughing through the waves next to the beach at Ponta Do Ouro, Mozambique

Hippo-style: Mr Hippo wonders what all the fuss is about as he goes for a swim in the clear blue waters off the African coastline

Red flag: The massive mammal is largely unaware of the huge waves that are crashing all around him as he goes for a wander in the shallows

Dippopotamus: The hippo seems to be enjoying the last of the sunshine as he wallows in the sea off the coast of the popular holiday spot

Does my bum look big in this? The wild animal struggles to get his huge frame over a rock on the shores of Ponta Do Ouro in Mozambique

Life's a beach: Mr Hippo takes a well-earned rest after all of his swimming. He spent three days around this stretch of coast in Mozambique before moving on to pastures new
