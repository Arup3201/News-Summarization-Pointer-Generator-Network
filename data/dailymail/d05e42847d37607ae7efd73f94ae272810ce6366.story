Christmas has come early for six-year-old Mukund Soni after he won the world's most expensive mince pie, worth £3,000.

The luxury Christmas treat is decorated with the highest-grade platinum leaf and ambergris sugar and the pastry bound together with holy water from Lourdes.

Thrilled Mukund won the pie in a raffle at the Marvellous Mince Pie Manufactory at The Exchange shopping centre in Ilford, East London.

Winter wonder: The world's most expensive mince pie is dusted with ambergris sugar - excreted by whales - and covered in platinum leaf

The delicacy was created by 25-year-old luxury food designer Andrew Stellitano using vanilla beans and cinnamon from eastern spice markets.

He then brushed it with eggnog and gilded it with platinum leaf, dusting the dessert with ambergris sugar - a bile excreted by sperm whales that sweetens over many years floating on the ocean.

Mr Stellitano created his magical pie using a 17th Century recipe, Victorian moulds and modern-day technology - tracing the intricate pastry design on a computer.

It took ten days for the 25-year-old, who runs food design company Astarism, to make the exclusive treat.

At its centre, the lucky schoolboy will find a coin, as is traditional in festive cakes and puddings - but this one is 99 per cent pure platinum and worth £600.

Mukund's father Mahendra said: 'Winning the world’s most expensive mince pie has been a big surprise this Christmas.

'Mukund loves watching MasterChef so when we heard about the Mince Pie Manufactory we had to come and take part.

'My wife and I have been thinking of buying gifts for the children so 
this is a fantastic additional present for them. 

'We’re looking forward
to inviting friends over for a celebration.'

Mr Stellitano said: 'The original idea was to look back at the history of the mince pie.

'I recreated the techniques used in the Victorian era with modern day technology.

'The precision Victorians couldn’t get with a knife, I can with a laser.'

'I adapted the tradition of placing coins in Christmas puddings, so for 
my mince pie I decided to place a 99 per cent pure platinum coin.'
