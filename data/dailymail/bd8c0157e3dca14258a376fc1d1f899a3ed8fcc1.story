A young man who is on the run from police has taunted officers by posting and 'liking' a wanted story on his Facebook page.

Jamie Muttram, 21, and his two siblings were dubbed 'The Asbros' because they terrorised their neighbours in their hometown of Plymouth, Devon.

The thug was released from prison less than half way through his 32-month sentence for attacking a man outside a pub.

But he has breached the terms of his release failed to report to police and officers have launched a search for him.

Jamie and his brothers Lee and Michael are responsible for a one-family crime wave have all been given Asbos.

He has taunted officers by posting links to newspaper articles on his Facebook page and has 'liked' them.

One
of his friends, Ashley Greenaway, wrote: 'cant believe it though mate 
your on the run already bro thought you was gonna be good?? but f*** it 
check check nuff respect (sic)'.

And another friend 'Gary N Jess Purdy' wrote: 'Muttram you naughty boi haha'.

A relative quizzed Muttram about his
fugitive status - to which thug replied 'yh i no f*** it swilly lmfao' 
and 'You no that bro'.

Devon and Cornwall Police have urged anyone who sees him to contact them immediately.

A spokesman said: 'We are actively looking for this man and we would urge him to hand himself in sooner rather than later.'

On
his Facebook page Muttram brags about being a member of the 'swilly 
army', referring to Plymouth's North Prospect council estate, known 
locally as Swilly.

Joke: His Facebook friends enjoyed the link he posted on the page

Tearaway: Jamie Muttram, 21, who is wanted by police

Police say the boasts were uploaded from the 6ft 1in brute's mobile after their wanted appeal was issued on May 1.

Muttram was sent to a Young Offenders Institution for 32 months in February last year for attacking a drinker outside a pub.

He and two friends battered their victim then cruelly ordered him to roll them a cigarette. All three pleaded guilty to grievous bodily harm and affray.

Jamie and his two brothers Lee and Michael were dubbed the 'Asbros' after an earlier court appearance for terrorising their local community.

Plymouth Crown Court heard the vile trio subjected neighbours to years of abuse and were linked to crimes ranging from indecent assault to intimidation, theft and vandalism.

Their offending was so prolific it took the prosecution ten minutes to read out a summary of their previous convictions.

Jamie was first convicted in 2005 and has a record which includes battery, burglary and threatening a witness or juror with intent to pervert the course of justice.

He was slapped with an anti-social behaviour order but continued to flaunt the law and was jailed for 18 months in January 2010.
