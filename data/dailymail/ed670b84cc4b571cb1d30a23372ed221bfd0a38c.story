Vajazzles are behind a huge rise in hospital admissions for embarrassing injuries to private parts.

Admissions of A&E patients with cuts and infections to their genitals jumped 50 per cent over the past five years.

Many of the women seeking medical help did so after a botched DIY vajazzle - body art popularised by The Only Way Is Essex beautican Amy Childs.

Other grooming procedures such as Brazilians are also behind the rise, with women needing treatment for misplaced sequins and cuts from razors, among other injuries.

Women in their late 30s are most likely to end up in casualty, but there have also been increases for females in their early 20s and late 40s.

But the Department for Health's NHS figures for genitourinary injuries - involving the genitals, urinary tract and kidneys - show men are still responsible for seven out of ten admissions.

The most common injuries for men are caused by being hit by a cricket ball or falling over while getting out of the bath.

Shadow public health minister, Dianne Abbott, told The Sun: 'It's up to young men playing sport and young women having grooming procedures done, like vajazzles, to make their own decisions about their health.

'It's their business. But I think it's a real shame if people's health and lives are being damaged by not taking enough care or having the right kit.'

The figures follow a report by the University of California showing 16,000 people a year are admitted to hospital with genital injuries in the US - where the vajazzle craze began.
