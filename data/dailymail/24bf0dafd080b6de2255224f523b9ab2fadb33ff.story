A former media director for Syracuse University's athletics department today admitted he secretly videotaped more than 100 football players and other male athletes in locker rooms.

Roger Springfield pleaded guilty to a single count of unlawful surveillance, and confessed to another three counts of secretly filming young boys at the New York State school and others.

The 57-year-old former sportscaster for a Syracuse television station was originally charged in January after a fellow Syracuse University staffer uncovered 15 minutes of the footage while working on a football highlights video in December.

In exchange for his guilty plea, Springfield was told today by the judge he'll be sentenced in June to 10 years' probation. He could have faced four years in state prison. The judge is also expected to rule on whether Springfield should be required to register as a sex offender.

Syracuse fired Springfield when the videos first came to light. Prosecutors said he made four secret videos in the Carrier Dome locker rooms used by the football, men's lacrosse and soccer teams.

Police said Springfield, whose real name is Roger Cahak, set up a camera at waist level and covered a red light that indicated the power was on.

Before SU hired him as director of media properties and productions, Springfield was a sportscaster for 11 years at WSTM-TV. He was employed by the university for nearly a decade.

His Defense attorney Jim McGraw claims his client should not be be put on the sex offender list because he's not a 'sexual threat.'

'He has no interest in men or boys,' McGraw said today, according to Syracuse.com. 'He has no interest in anybody other than his wife.'

Investigation: Prosecutors said the charges stem from at least four secret videos the 57-year-old Springfield made between the spring of 2010 and November 2012 in the Carrier Dome

McGraw said Springfield taped the young athletes because of his childhood, but did not elaborate further. He said he provided the judge with a psychiatric assessment for his client.

But Assistant District Attorney Jeremy Cali said that is was 'clear from the content' of the footage that Springfield is a threat and should be listed because he committed a registrable offense.

Springfield is due to be sentenced on June 6 but McGraw asked today if the hearing could be brought forward.

'(Springfield) wants to get on with his life,' the lawyer said outside of court. 'His wife is gone, his reputation is ruined. There's no sense prolonging a trial.'

The former media director for Syracuse University's athletic department initially pleaded not guilty in January to charges that he secretly filmed at least 108 athletes taking post-game showers.

Roger Springfield was arraigned in Onondaga County Court on January 16 on four counts of unlawful surveillance.

The charges stem from at least four secret videos the 57-year-old made between the spring of 2010 and November 2012 in the Carrier Dome.

Authorities said Springfield made the videos in the locker rooms of the football team and the men's lacrosse and soccer teams.

Onondaga County District Attorney William Fitzpatrick said the investigation began after a Syracuse employee noticed 'clearly inappropriate material' on an 'exceptionally long' segment of locker-room footage on a video from Syracuse's football game against South Florida on October 27 in Tampa, Florida.

The district attorney said the 
employee brought it to the attention of his supervisor, the school 
notified Fitzpatrick's office and Syracuse police in early December, and
an investigation was begun.

After
reviewing the tapes, Springfield's home and the media room at Manley 
Field House were searched. Springfield was questioned by detectives, 
suspended and then fired by the university on December 13.

Fitzpatrick said the charges stemmed from videos that included the Louisville football game on November 10, a soccer game last year and two lacrosse games in 2010.

Authorities have identified 108 victims, all of them male athletes.

Fitzpatrick said there is no evidence that Springfield disseminated the recordings or still images to anyone else. There also is no evidence that Springfield engaged in any inappropriate sexual contact with any of the athletes, the district attorney said.

Authorities said at least 10 other videos were found, including one made in Massachusetts and one shot in Akron, Ohio, but they fell outside the statute of limitations.

Fitzpatrick said investigators quickly discounted the fact that the footage might have been accidental.

'You can see him setting up the camera, and it appears from the evidence uncovered that he placed the camera at waist level and used a piece of tape to conceal the red light on top of the camera indicating it was on and working,' Fitzpatrick said.

'This is in no stretch of the imagination a victimless crime.'

Syracuse has reached out to all student-athletes involved to offer them support and assistance, said Kevin Quinn, senior vice president for public affairs.
