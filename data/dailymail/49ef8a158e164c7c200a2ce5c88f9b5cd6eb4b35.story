She says she doesn’t feel a day over 70, but the oldest person in Britain celebrated her 112th birthday today.

Gladys Hooper said the secret to her longevity is ‘living a straight life’ and keeping active.

She has only just taken the title of Britain’s oldest person after the death of 114-year-old Ethel Lang on Thursday, who was who the last person in the UK born during the reign of Queen Victoria.

On finding out the news, Mrs Hooper, who lives in the Isle of Wight, said: ‘I am very surprised, I thought I was just the oldest person on the island.’

Mrs Hooper, who has a son, four grandchildren and six-great-grandchildren, added: ‘I have always been busy, I prefer being busy than being idle.

‘I have always lived a straight life, never done stupid things, I have never gone beyond the limit. I have always been active, I think always being active keeps you young. I have done what I wanted to do and helped others as much as I could. I do not feel anything like the age I am, I do not feel any different to when I was 70.’

The great-grandmother has certainly achieved a lot in her lifetime. Born in 1903 in Dulwich, south-east London, and brought up in Rottingdean, near Brighton, she became a concert pianist in London and often performed with bands in dance halls.

In the early 1920s, she also started what is thought to have been one of the first car hire firms, Autodrive, and turned down a request from the founder of Hertz to be his managing director.

She later ran Kingscliff House School, which is now Brighton College.

The theme of aviation has also run through her lifetime. She was born the same year the Wright brothers built the first successful aeroplane, and was close friends with Amy Johnson, the pioneering aviator who was the first woman to fly solo from England to Australia.

Her husband Leslie, whom she married in 1922, was a pilot in the Royal Flying Corps in the First World War and in the RAF in the Second World War. 

Her 84-year-old son Derek Hermiston is a retired pilot. After her husband died in 1977, Mrs Hooper moved to the Isle of Wight and now lives in an apartment in her son’s house in Ryde, a town on the coast.

His wife Veronica, 68, said: ‘She has done an awful lot. She is a very strong lady, a very amazing person.’

She added: ‘We are very proud of her and we have watched her go on and on, she doesn’t change.

‘She lost her last sister three months ago, the youngest one. There were six of them altogether – five girls and one boy – she was the oldest and the longest.

‘Gladys told me that she had a very difficult birth, she came out with a misshapen head and the midwife said “I do not think she will do much”. But she was brilliant at maths and music and proved the midwife wrong.’

Mr Hermiston said she is still mentally very fit, adding: ‘I am very proud of her, she does very well since she was 100. She is a really nice person who has done a lot of good things for others during her war service.’

Members of her family travelled from Brighton, Derby and even Canada to be with her for her big day. Mrs Hooper said her special treat for the day would be to have ‘a nice birthday cake’.

The oldest person in the world is thought to be Misao Okawa, a Japanese woman who turned 116 in March last year.
