Liberty Ross' world was turned upside down when allegations emerged that Kristen Stewart had an affair with her husband Rupert Sanders.

And the model and actress, who played 22-year-old Kristen’s mother in 
Snow White and the Huntsman, responded with just one word: 'Wow.'

She posted the message on July 24, just moments after Us Weekly called her director husband's spokesperson for comment, according to the magazine.

The 33-year-old, who has two young children with the British director, 41, has since deleted her Twitter account, presumably due to being bombarded with messages after the news broke.

Before deleting her page Liberty had also posted a series of cryptic tweets that seemed to be referencing the alleged affair.

She retweeted a quote from Marilyn Monroe which read: 'Sometimes good things fall apart so better things can fall together.'

She later followed this with another retweet, this time quoting American author and poet Maya Angelou, saying: 'If you find it in your heart to care for somebody else, you will have succeeded.'

'Wow,' was her final note before signing off.

Should Robert Pattinson forgive Kristen Stewart for cheating?

Liberty played Queen Eleanor to Kristen’s Snow White in the box office hit, which was directed by Rupert and released last month.

Last Tuesday, Kristen was caught in the arms of Rupert, with Us Weekly running photographic evidence of their intimate dalliance in it's new issue.

Kristen today issued a grovelling apology to her boyfriend, Twilight co-star Robert Pattinson, in a uprising public statement.

In a statement to People magazine, she said: 'I'm deeply sorry for the hurt and embarrassment I've caused to those close to me and everyone this has affected. This momentary indiscretion has jeopardized the most important thing in my life, the person I love and respect the most, Rob. I love him, I love him, I'm so sorry.'

Rupert quickly followed suit and issued a statement to People which said: 'I am utterly distraught about the pain I have caused my family.  My beautiful wife and heavenly children are all I have in this world. I love them with all my heart. I am praying that we can get through this together.'

Only a few weeks ago, Liberty gushed 
to YOU magazine about how proud she is of her husband since he found 
fame in his own right, compared to when she was the bigger star.

She recalled how she used to call him
'the Hand' and explained: 'In every picture that was taken of me at a 
party or a premiere, he'd be chopped off, and all you would ever see was
his hand.

'At the world premiere in London, I 
had tears in my eyes, because we got out of our fancy car and all of his
fans started screaming his name. The tables had really turned!'

The pair married when Liberty was 24 
and Rupert was 31, and Liberty said of the beginnings of their romance: 
'Once we started going out, I knew he was the one for me. He is a very 
special soul.'

Mum's the word: Liberty played Queen Eleanor, the late mother of Snow White in the film

They have a seven-year-old daughter named Skyla and a five-year-old-son named Tennyson together.

However Liberty has said that all the time they spent apart has caused difficulties, and told YOU: 'I would never say out loud that I am raising my children alone, but a lot of the time it has felt like that.'

Kristen's
alleged infidelity came just months after Robert gave an interview to 
Italian Vanity Fair magazine saying that he has 'never understood' 
people who cheat.

He 
said: 'There is one thing I've never understood: Why people cheat. My 
parents met when my mom was 17 and my father 25, they are still 
together, and seem very happy.

'I grew up believing that you can be together all of your life.'

The
pair made their latest public appearance when they took the stage 
together at the Teen Choice Awards on Sunday – just two days before the 
news broke.

Speaking about his lead actress in 
the role at one of the movie's premieres last month, Rupert said he was 
thrilled by Kristen’s performance.

He
told E! News: 'She's got a great spirit, she's really quite 
rebellious...and feisty and kind of wild. And that's really what I 
wanted the modern Snow White to have.

'I didn't want her to be timid and I didn't want her to be frightened and relying on men, you know. 'She's
very strong and very driven, and I think that's true in her personal 
life... She's got a big weight of the world on her shoulders and she 
carries it incredibly well.'

Snow
White And The Huntsman marks the first major motion picture that Rupert
directed - but he has already signed on to take the helm of the sequel.
