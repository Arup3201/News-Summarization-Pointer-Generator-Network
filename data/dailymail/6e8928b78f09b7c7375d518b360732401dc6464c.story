Don Lemon has had the last laugh despite his widely ridiculed coverage of the Blizzard of 2015 in which he tooled around a desolate Manhattan while reporting from a car he dubbed the 'Blizzardmobile.'

While Lemon trended on Twitter for hours, it was mostly thanks to viewers poking fun at such bizarre segments as his 4-way panel on Deflate-gate, report on Aaron Hernandez and repeated use of the word Blizzardmobile - which was in fact just a SUV.

However, CNN's Brian Stelter says it was a big hit.

It was just a car: CNN's 'Blizzardmobile' coverage with Don Lemon on the streets of a deserted Manhattan won ridicule Monday night but also big ratings

'About last night,' Stelter tweeted Tuesday. 'CNN's 10pm hour, w/ @DonLemon in the #blizzardmobile, was its highest-rated hour of the day in 25-54 demo. Topped Fox.'

The Twitter critics had no way to know this, of course, and even after Stelter's boast, jokes about Blizzardgate continued popping up across social media.

Among those making fun of Lemon and his glorified SUV was comedian Mike Birbiglia, who tweeted: 

Last laugh? Despite all the ridicule it received, the Blizzardmobile was a hit, according to CNN's Brian Stelter

Who's to blame? Viewers took to Twitter to express their confusion over Don Lemon's antics in the Blizzardmobile, which included a 4-way discussion of Deflate-gate with the chyron 'Who's to blame for deflated balls' all while Lemon sat inside the oddly-lit SUV

'Gotta be a strange feeling when you're driving in your weird, dimly lit "Blizzard Mobile" and realize it's only gonna be a foot of snow.'

Jezebel managing editor Erin Gloria Ryan joked, 'Twist: Don Lemon's Blizzardmobile rounds a corner and discovers, on an empty Manhattan street, the missing plane.'

And in response to one of Blizzardmobile's oddest moments, Mark Joyella tweeted:

'SOMEONE TELL ME WHAT I AM WATCHING,' along with screenshot of Lemon's 4-way discussion which featured a CNN chyron that read: 'Who's to blame for deflated balls?'

Despite its flashy name, the Blizzardmobile was a run-of-the mill vehicle
