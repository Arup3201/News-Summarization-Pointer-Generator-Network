Trendsetter: Natalie Massenet made Net-a-Porter a global phenomenon 

When Natalie Massenet set up a website selling luxury fashions 15 years ago, her critics said it would never work.

But that company, Net-a-Porter.com, proved to be a huge hit – with women saving up more than £2,000 for dresses by top designers such as Valentino.

Now the online firm she founded from a London flat in 2000 is about to go through a mega-merger with an Italian fashion group – netting the mother of two about £70million.

The deal with Yoox, expected to be announced this week after both sides confirmed talks yesterday, will make the business worth £1billion.

It is a remarkable success story for UK-based Miss Massenet, who is credited with changing the way women shop for high-end fashion.

Her website has become a global phenomenon, reaching sales of more than £500million and spawning copycat sites across the world.

The daughter of a British Chanel model, the 49-year-old former fashion magazine journalist set up her online business just as the dotcom crash hit in 2000. Aged just 33 and struggling to get any funding, she eventually managed to raise just over a million in start-up capital from her Chelsea flat.

She launched the business with her then husband Arnaud while pregnant with her first child, despite warnings from sceptics who thought women would refuse to buy expensive clothes without trying them on.

But the site has been a huge hit with the wealthy as well as those who simply live a long way from London’s designer shops and save for months for an item. Top-end products on the site include a JW Anderson leather panelled mini dress for £1,350 and a black silk satin jacket by Givenchy for £2,675.

Miss Massenet, who split from her husband in 2011 after 15 years of marriage, has since expanded the company into menswear with a site called Mr Porter and a discount site called the Outnet.com.

She is due to receive the fruits of the mega-merger, which analysts say will bring a range of benefits, once the deal is finalised. She is expected to receive more than £70million on top of the £50million she made from selling the business to current owner, Swiss luxury giant Richemont, in 2010.

That deal valued the business at £280million. The merger with Yoox, which sells overstocked or unsold designer goods from previous seasons, values it at a staggering £1billion.

California-born Miss Massenet, who is currently the chairman of the British Fashion Council, may stay on in her role as chairman of the business.

She worked for US magazine Women's Wear Daily and later became an assistant to stylist and fashion muse Isabella Blow at Tatler. 

Net-a-Porter is famous for its plush back and cream ribbon-wrapped delivery boxes, with designer items lovingly wrapped in crisp tissue paper. During the financial crisis women who were unable to give up their Net-a-Porter habit asked for their purchases to be delivered in plain wrapping, to hide their extravagance from colleagues.
