These stunning images reveal the battered surface of one of Saturn's icy moons in extraordinary detail.

The pictures were taken by Nasa’s Cassini spacecraft during its final flyby of Rhea, which is about 1.2billion km from Earth.

The unprocessed images show its large craters formed by millions of years of collisions with space rocks.

Battered: Saturn's icy moon Rhea has been pictured in extraordinary detail

Craggy: The deep craters were formed by collisions with space rocks

Deep space: Cassini took the images as it flew with 620 miles of the surface of the moon

Beautiful: Rhea is about 1.2billion kilometres away from Earth and is Saturn's second largest moon

Nasa's Cassini spacecraft took the 
photographs on March 9 as it flew within 997km (620 miles) of the 
surface of the moon - one of Saturn's 60 satellites.

It was Cassini's fourth and final encounter with Rhea.

The spacecraft is due to pass the moon in a few years’ time but at a much greater distance.

It is only scheduled to operate until 2017 and will not make another flyby of the moon before it disintegrates.

Carolyn Porco, Cassini imaging team 
lead from the Space Science Institute in Boulder, Colorado, was quoted 
by NBC as saying: 'Take a good, long, luxurious look at these sights 
from another world, as they will be the last close-ups you'll ever see of this particular moon'.

The flyby was designed to measure Rhea's gravity field.

Final: The pictures were taken during Cassini's last trip to Rhea

Scientists also collected cosmic dust to try to work out the rate at which objects and small meteors bombard the Saturn system.

However, the spacecraft managed to take detailed pictures of the moon's surface revealing its craggy and ancient landscape.

New 'curious' features were shown for the first time, which scientists still do not understand.

These include a narrow fracture or 
'graben' along the surface, which is made up of a block of ground lower 
than its surroundings and bordered by cliffs on either side.

A Nasa statement said: 'This feature 
looks remarkably recent, cutting most of the craters it crosses, with 
only a few small craters superimposed.'

Rhea is Saturn's second largest moon and has a diameter of 1,500km (949 miles).

The Cassini mission is jointly run by NASA, the European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency.

Rhea was discovered by mathematician and astronomer Giovanni Domenico Cassini, who gave his name to the mission.
