Painter Jack Vettriano, whose work has been labelled as 'dim erotica', but sells for hundreds of thousands of pounds has criticised the art establishment for snubbing his work.

The 63-year-old's paintings are hugely popular, and have been reproduced countless times on posters, calendars and souvenir mugs.

But despite his success, critics of the Scottish artist have branded his work 'brainless' and 'dim erotica' - statements he says are down to his popularity.

Painter Jack Vettriano, whose work has been labelled as 'dim erotica', but sells for hundreds of thousands of pounds has criticised the art establishment for snubbing his work

'They don't like an artist who is as popular as me because it takes away part of their authority,' he told Radio Times magazine. 

'If they want to ignore me, let them.

'I have what I want and that is the support of the public and that means far more to me than the approval of a bunch of well-educated art buffs.'

Vettriano's most famous painting The Singing Butler, featuring a couple dancing on a beach despite an approaching storm, sold for almost £750,000 at auction in 2004

Vettriano's most famous painting The Singing Butler, featuring a couple dancing on a beach despite an approaching storm, was rejected for display at the Royal Academy summer exhibition after it was completed in 1992.

However, it went on to fetch almost £750,000 at auction in 2004, a record at the time for a Scottish artist, and has since appeared on prints, posters and even Marks and Spencer biscuit tins.

'The person who made that decision ought to go and live in a cave somewhere,' Vettriano said of its omission from the Royal Academy show.

'That painting has since sold over 10 million copies. How could somebody get something so wrong?'

The artist, who often paints women in stockings, heels and suspenders, said: 'There are days when I think, 'What is it they (critics) don't like about me?'

'To be honest with you I just don't think they see sex as a serious subject. If I was painting drug use or inner-city violence they'd consider that to be art.

'They think what I paint is just titillation. It's not titillation, it's what every couple does on a Saturday night'.

Hollywood star Jack Nicholson and Sir Alex Ferguson are among owners of his paintings.

Despite his immense popularity with the public, Jack Vettriano has often been the recipient of more negative comments from art critics

Despite his immense popularity with the public, Jack Vettriano has often been the recipient of more negative comments from art critics, and was once famously described as 'The Jeffrey Archer of the art world'.

Throughout the years, his work has been described as twee and chauvinistic, with his more erotically-charged material written off as 'pornography'.

However, his work has sold for thousands, and he is believed to be Britain's most reproduced artist - making thousands from versions of his paintings. 

Scottish art historian Duncan Macmillan once said of Vittriano: 'He’s welcome to paint so long as nobody takes him seriously.'

And Guardian art critic Jonathan Jones said: 'Jack Vettriano is no 21st-century Van Gogh. He is the Tom Jones of art: big, bold, brassy and devoid of inner truth.'

Jones added: 'The world of Jack Vettriano is a crass male fantasy that might have come straight out of Money by Martin Amis.'

Sandy Moffat, head of drawing and painting at Glasgow School of Art, said: 'He can’t paint, he just colours in', while Richard Calvocoressi, former director of The Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art, said: 'I’d be more than happy to say that we think him an indifferent painter and that he is very low down our list of priorities (whether or not we can afford his work, which at the moment we obviously can’t). 

'His "popularity" rests on cheap commercial reproductions of his paintings.'  

Alice Jones wrote in The Independent that in Vettriano's paintings 'women are sexual objects, frequently half naked and vulnerable, always in stockings and stilettos.'

But sculptor David Mach has spoken out in support of Vettriano saying in The Scotsman: 'If he was a fashion designer Jack would be right up there. 

'It’s all just art world snobbery. Anyway, who cares, he probably makes more money than Damien Hirst anyway.'

Vittriano himself has said of criticism that his popularity is down to the prints and greetings cards, that Van Gogh and Monet would have been in favour of selling reproductions, telling Radio 4 in 2013: 'Let me put this to you, if Van Gough were alive, if Monet were alive, and you were to say to them, "look, you can sell a print to a Frenchman for 10 francs", they would have jumped at the chance.'
