The morbidly obese Frenchman left stranded in Britain after being stopped from boarding a Eurostar train for safety reasons has arrived in France.

P&O Ferries said the ship that Kevin Chenais, 22, was travelling on from Dover had arrived safely in Calais at 6.10pm yesterday.

A spokesman said: 'He did travel as planned on the Spirit of Britain at 4.40pm and the ship arrived in France on schedule.'

From
Calais, Mr Chenais and his family are now continuing their journey in the 
ambulance to their home in the town of Ferney-Voltaire in south-eastern 
France.

Heading home: Kevin Chenais is now finally going home in an ambulance and ferry

Condition: Kevin, who suffers from a medical condition, is helped onto an ambulane at St Pancras today

Ferry: P&O agreed to pay for his trip home on one of their ferries

P&O
Ferries finally offered to take him in an ambulance across the English 
Channel, the final hurdle keeping him from his home near the Swiss 
border, after Eurostar said he posed a safety risk.

'It's terrible. It's discrimination. 
It was very hard, tiring and a big waste of money for my parents," the 
22-year-old told RTL radio.

Slumped over in his mobility scooter, he said he was exhausted just before being loaded into the ambulance.

His mother was outraged by the treatment her son allegedly received, saying
he was discriminated against because of his weight.

'It's
not the fault of my son to be big. He has a genetic illness,' Christina
Chenais said.

'We are very happy to go home after this long, 
distressing and traumatic situation.'

Heading home: Kevin Chenais 22, who was 
deemed too heavy to fly with BA, arrives at Heathrow Airport yesterday 
after flying from New York to London

Kevin Chenais - who has a hormone imbalance and went to the United States for treatment - touched down at Heathrow yesterday

Refusal: He was refused a British Airways flight after the airline determined the 22-year-old, who weighs 230 kilograms (500 pounds), was too heavy to have on board

The
saga of Mr Chenais, who reportedly weighs 35 stone, began 
when he was left stranded in America after British Airways refused to 
carry him on his return ticket.

In the end, Virgin Atlantic flew him into London.

But
Mr Chenais, who uses a mobility scooter, then encountered more 
difficulties when trying to reach France from London when Eurostar 
declined to transport him.

It
said it had to operate under 'very strict safety rules' and that Mr 
Chenais' immobility meant he posed a safety risk 'to himself, our crew 
and all of the other passengers on board'.

Kevin's father criticised British Airways
for paying just five nights in a hotel, where in the end they spent
13 days

Clinic

Eurostar
said: 'Despite being unable to travel with us yesterday due to the very
strict safety regulations governing evacuation from the Channel Tunnel 
in the event of an emergency, we have nonetheless worked tirelessly over
the past 24 hours to identify an alternative solution.

'Having
arranged overnight accommodation in central London for Mr Chenais and 
his family, we contacted P&O last night to request their assistance 
arranging passage across the Channel.'

Eurostar said it has paid for the family to be driven to Dover in a special ambulance.

The
P&O Ferries spokesman said: 'We are used to carrying ambulances 
across the Channel, so we are set up for this type of thing.

'It's
difficult to imagine the frustration that this gentleman has gone 
through. But for us, it's very straightforward as we are set up to carry
people who have medical needs.'

Safety fears: Eurostar said Mr Chenais had been refused travel because of difficulties that could be faced when trying to evacuate him in an emergency

A BA spokesman said: 'We will always try to accommodate someone if it's possible and safe to do so'

Kevin and his parents were stuck at a hotel
close to Chicago Airport because British Airways refusal and were
preparing to travel to New York to sail home on the liner Queen

According to reports, Mr Chenais - who needs regular care - had been in the United States for treatment for a hormone imbalance.

A British Airways statement said: 'We will always try to accommodate someone if it's possible and safe to do so.

'Our customer service team worked diligently to find a solution and have exhausted all options.

'Unfortunately it was not possible to safely accommodate the customer and the family has been offered a full refund.'
