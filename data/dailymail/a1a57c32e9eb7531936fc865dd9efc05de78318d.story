Storms of up to 90mph are set to batter the country by the weekend. Winds as powerful as those which caused misery last winter will sweep in tomorrow, forecasters have warned.

The Met Office issued official weather warnings for northern England and Scotland, saying there may be power cuts, transport chaos and damage to homes and buildings.

The most powerful winds of 80 to 90mph will be seen in Scotland on Friday and Saturday, as the centres of two consecutive storms pass by the northern coast. In northern parts of England and Wales winds could reach 70mph, with gales of 50mph seen in the South.

Here they come: Two storms are set to hit the north of the UK in quick succession on Friday and Saturday because of a strong jet stream, currently travelling at a speed of around 250mph moving across the Atlantic Ocean. It will bring winds of up to 90mph in northern Scotland

The Met Office alert said: ‘The public should be aware of potential for disruption to transport and power supplies and the possibility of structural damage. Large waves may also lead to dangerous conditions along some coasts.’

At the same time, temperatures will be remarkably mild for this time of year, reaching 15C (59F) in London – compared with the average January temperature of 6.9C (44.4F).

Forecasters said the ferocious weather is being caused by an exceptionally strong jet stream triggered by cold conditions in the US.

Frank Saunders, chief meteorologist at the Met Office, said: ‘The jet stream effectively fuels low pressure systems moving across the Atlantic, causing them to deepen rapidly as they pass to the north of the UK.

‘This will bring some very strong winds across the UK, but they will most likely be strongest in northern Scotland.’

Mark Wilson of the Met Office said wind speeds would be similar to those seen in the fierce storms towards the end of 2013, when tens of thousands of homes were left without power, trees were uprooted, trains and flights cancelled and floods crippled huge swathes of the UK.

But while the worst weather then was seen in southern England, this time rural parts of Scotland will bear the brunt, Mr Wilson added. 

Yellow weather warnings for the strong gales have been issued for much of Scotland on Friday (left), when the first storm is due to hit, and for a wider area of the north and central England when the second jetstream is forecast to hit the country on Saturday (right) 

Severe weather warnings have been issued for both Friday and Saturday. 

These are currently yellow - be prepared - warnings, but Mr Saunders said these could be changed as the storm is tracked. 

Forecasters have not issued warnings for rain on Thursday and Friday, with heavy rain in the South East on Wednesday expected to end by Thursday.

The storms will also hit at a time when the UK is seeing above average temperatures for this time of year - double what is normal in some areas. 

In the North the mercury is expected to reach 10C on Friday and between 12C and 13C on Saturday.

This is more than double the average of 5.7C for this time in the region.

In London, Friday could see 'unseasonably warm' temperatures recorded as the mercury is expected to reach 15C.

Again, this is double the average of 7C expected at this time of year.

However forecasters said it will not feel warm because of the strong winds battering much of the UK. 

The deep and strong jet stream is currently moving towards the UK, with current winds of up to 250mph (depicted by the white areas to left) 

The first storm will hit the north of the UK on Friday and will be followed by a successor that will be even more wide ranging in the north 

The storms are similar to those experienced last winter in December and January, when high winds and downpours caused devastation in the South.

Tens of thousands of homes were left without power, trees were uprooted, trains and flights cancelled and floods crippled huge swathes of the UK.

Parts of the Somerset Levels were left submerged for weeks after the heavy downpours. 

Bethany Freeman, 17, died when the tree came down on a caravan as she slept in Kent.

And 14-year-old Dylan Atkins was swept out to sea when he played near waves in Newhaven, East Sussex.

However forecasters said this year's storms are different because they will be more focused on the North of England.

This part of the country is more used to coping with extremes of weather and less heavily populated. 

There is also expected to be considerably less rain, which caused havoc in the South during last winter.

Wintry weather is forecast to start on Thursday evening with strong winds hitting Scotland and the North West on Friday morning.

This is expected to move east on Friday afternoon.

But there will be little respite as by Saturday afternoon a second system will move in, bringing stronger winds to a wider area of the north.

Laura Young, a forecaster at the Met Office, said: 'These are being caused by very deep low pressure back to back in some areas. 

'It will be more widespread than anything we've seen so far this winter. 

'The cold weather in America is having an impact on the jet stream and is strengthening it. At the moment the jet stream is moving at about 230mph.' 

Yellow weather warnings are in place for the whole of Scotland and much of the north of the UK for Thursday and Friday. 

The double storm warning comes as it was revealed that last year was the hottest ever for the UK, with an average temperature of 9.9C. 

The previous record, set in 2006, saw an average temperature of 9.7C.

The 2014 record means that eight of the UK's top ten warmest years have happened since 2002.

Last year also became the fourth wettest year ever on record.
