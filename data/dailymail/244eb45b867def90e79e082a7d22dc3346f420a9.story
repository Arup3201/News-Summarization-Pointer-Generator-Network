One of Europe's largest Jewish associations has written a letter to EU ministers asking for gun laws to be relaxed to allow Jews to arm themselves to protect against terror attacks.

Rabbi Menachem Margolin, the head of the European Jewish Association, made the request in the wake of the Paris attacks in which four Jews were killed inside a deli in the French capital.

In the letter, dated January 13, he asks for permission for 'people in the Jewish communities and institutions to own weapons' to protect against 'anti-Semitism, racism, and intolerance'.

Rabbi Menachem Margolin warned that 'anti-Semitism, racism, and intolerance' were threatening Jews in Europe while calling for relaxed gun laws (pictured, French soldiers guard Jewish quarter of Paris)

Mr Margolin, who is also the head of the Rabbinical Centre of Europe, speaks of the need 'stop talking and start acting' while seeking to reassure ministers by saying the guns will be for 'self-protection only'.

The letter speaks about the need for protection after Islamist Amedy Coulibaly gunned down four Jewish shoppers in cold blood in a Paris deli last Friday before he was shot by armed police.

The fanatic said he had deliberately chosen a Jewish shop, claiming his victims were legitimate targets in revenge for the deaths of Muslims in Palestine. 

Police later found he had maps showing the locations of Jewish schools in Paris. 

Hundreds of armed police have been dispatched to guard Jewish schools around France since the attacks last week, with military units standing in reserve. 

The letter also comes amid warnings of a tide of antisemitism across France as a Jewish emigration agency warned a record 15,000 Jews are expected to flee the country for Israel this year.

In 2014 a total of 7,086 Jews emigrated from France to Israel, the highest number in the world, up from 3,293 in 2013. 

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has set up committee to look at ways of boosting Jewish immigration from France and other EU countries 'which are being hit by terrible anti-Semitism'.

His letter comes after Amedy Coulibaly attacked a Jewish deli, killing four. A letter was found justifying Jews as legitimate targets for attacks, along with a map marking Jewish schools in Paris

Netanyahu's said that every Jew who wanted to move to Israel would be 'welcomed with a warm heart and open arms.'

In Britain, a survey also found that half of Britons believed at least one antisemetic value to be 'definitely or probably true' when presented with a list of statements.

One in eight believed Jews talked about the Holocaust to get sympathy, one in four believed Jewish people 'chase money more than others', while one in six felt Jews thought they were better than other people. 

Nobody from the European Council of Ministers was immediately available for comment on the letter when contacted by Mail Online this afternoon.

Mr Margolin was also unavailable to speak with Mail Online, but told the Washington Beacon: 'We demanded from the European governments some time ago that action should be taken [and] were not surprised to see the results in Paris. 

'Many people today are not coming to synagogue because of the issue and they’d be more comfortable if they knew people were trained to react in an emergency.'
