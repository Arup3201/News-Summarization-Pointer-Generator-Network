St Helens player Louie McCarthy-Scarsbrook has been punished by the Rugby Football League for swearing in the immediate aftermath of his club's Grand-Final triumph.

Sky Sports were forced to apologise to viewers after an excited McCarthy-Scarsbrook accidently let slip a swear word during a live interview just moments after he had helped his side to a surprise 14-6 win over Wigan at Old Trafford last Saturday.

He was on Thursday fined £250 after being found guilty of misconduct, although the fine is suspended until the end of next season.

An RFL spokesman said: 'McCarthy-Scarsbrook was deemed to be in breach of operational rule D1.8(c) and the RFL's Respect policy.'
