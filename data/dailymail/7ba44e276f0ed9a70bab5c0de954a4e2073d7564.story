Two friends who got gastric bands together after getting fed up of their size 20 plus figures ended up being nicknamed ‘little and large’ after the surgery had an opposite effect.

Lisa O’Sullivan, 46, dropped to a size six after her gastric band was fitted as opposed to best friend Claire Green, 38, who remained a size 24.

They decided to take action after over two decades of friendship they slowly ballooned in size until 5ft 4ins Lisa became a 16-stone size 20 and 5ft 9in Claire was a 20-stone size 24.

Best friends Lisa O'Sullivan and Claire Green both decided to have weight loss surgery after they ballooned to size 20 plus

They both kept trying diets without success and with her 40th birthday close Lisa decided to take drastic action.

Inspired
 by her friend, Claire also booked in to have surgery and a month later 
they were lying in side-by-side hospital beds in Belgium.

But
 that’s where their paths diverged. While Lisa then lost so much weight 
she went down to a six-stone size four and was labelled anorexic, Claire 
didn’t lose a single pound.

Mrs
 O’Sullivan said: ‘We’d always been fat together so it was awful when I 
ended up so thin. We got called the Little and Large show.’

Only
 now, six years later, have they finally achieved the figures they 
always wanted. Procurement manager Lisa has gained weight and sales 
manager Claire has finally shed some of hers.

Mrs
 O’Sullivan added: ‘There were times when we questioned what the hell we
 had done. It’s been a bumpy ride but neither of us regret it because we
 got here in the end. We supported each other through it and now we love
 finally being slim together.’

The
 friends met at work in 1991 and with matching appetites for fatty, 
sugary foods they went shopping together for goodies to eat at their 
desks.

Mrs O’Sullivan, from Mansfield, 
Nottingham, said: ‘Every lunchtime we would hit the supermarket with a 
trolley. It looked like we were shopping for a party but it was just our
 lunch and afternoon snacks.

‘We
 would eat huge meals and desserts. For lunch we would have a huge 
filled baguette, a bag of crisps and some chocolate or biscuits.’

Every
 afternoon they snacked on treats including chocolate Minstrels, 
flapjacks, cookies, Dairy Milk bars and Babybel cheeses. But they hated 
being fat, felt guilty, and vowed to change their unhealthy ways.

Ms
 Green, from Birmingham, said: ‘Over the years we tried every diet going
 together. We’d lose a bit of weight then our love of food would take 
over and we’d start scoffing treats again.’

When Lisa was 39 they were living and working in different areas, but still remained best friends.

She
 recalls: ‘Food was still our favourite topic. But I didn’t want to be 
fat at 40 so told Claire my surgery plan and wasn’t surprised when she 
followed suit.’

With the operation likely to cost them £10,000 each in the UK, they went abroad where the price was £4,000. The night before the surgery in Brussels they pigged out at a Chinese restaurant.

Ms Green said: ‘It felt like the last supper because we both knew we would never be able to do it again.’

The next morning Lisa was first into theatre for the two-hour operation and the friends spent two days recovering before flying home.

In the first two weeks Lisa lost half a stone eating tiny amounts of pureed food. But Claire didn’t lose anything.

She said: ‘I wasn’t too worried at that point. Everyone is different so I hoped I would catch up.’

Over the following year Lisa lost three stone but Claire was still struggling.

Ms Green said: ‘I didn’t feel envious. Lisa was proof that it could work and I just needed to get mine right.

‘She could barely eat half of a plate of food but I could still polish off the lot.’

By the time Lisa had dropped to a size 12 Claire had gone back to Belgium for new surgery to adjust her band. Afterwards her weight finally started to fall off.

But Lisa was still losing pound after pound even though she’d passed her target.

After treating herself to a whole new size 12 wardrobe, in the year that followed it started to swamp her frame and soon she had to wear a tiny size six.

She said: ‘I was trying to eat more but would just bring it back up and kept losing more weight. I bought a size eight outfit before I went on holiday, and when I returned two weeks later it drowned me. I had lost another stone in that fortnight.

‘It got to the point where I could only eat tiny amounts of food and even that would leave me in pain and being sick. I reached a size four and looked anorexic.

‘I hated it – I looked old and haggard. People kept asking me if I was ill. I knew they meant with an eating disorder.

‘My husband Clive had been so supportive all the way. When I told him I wanted the surgery he said it was my decision and he would back me. But when I lost so much weight he was really worried.’

Eventually Lisa’s boss insisted she go to hospital for a check-up and it was later confirmed that her band had slipped, meaning she wasn’t absorbing any nutrients and had become seriously malnourished.

‘It was made even more difficult because my surgeon was in Belgium so I couldn’t keep nipping back to see him,’ she said. ‘When I was admitted to hospital here the doctors had to speak to my surgeon in Brussels so they could work together to solve the problem.’

She had a new operation to correct the problem and was told to keep eating until her weight reached a healthy range.

She said: ‘It was fun being able to eat what I wanted again. I was so relieved when my bottom and bust started to fill out again.’

Eventually she reached 10 stone and a size 10-12. She said: ‘My wardrobe was stuffed with everything from size 20 to size four. It was ridiculous.’

While Lisa was regaining weight Claire, who is single, had dropped to 13 stone 12lbs and a size 14 and was finally happy with her figure too.

She said: ‘We went from being two fatties to Little and Large and now we both feel fabulous. It wasn’t exactly the quick answer we hoped, but we couldn’t be happier now.’

Mrs O’Sullivan added: ‘Instead of bonding over our love of food, now we bond over our love of clothes and shopping.

‘Every time we see each other we hit the shops. Unless you have been overweight you don’t understand what it feels like now to be thin. It has boosted our confidence no end.

‘It is amazing just to be able to go out and buy what you want and wear what you want for the first time ever. We have both gone from wearing black shapeless things and leggings to buying nice colourful dresses, even bikinis for holidays.

‘I love shoes and have more than 300 pairs but even my shoe size has dropped from a 7.5 to a 6. I need to have a good clear-out to make room for some more.’

To celebrate their slimming success, the pair booked a glamorous photoshoot - something they would never have dreamed of before their surgery.

Ms O’Sullivan said: ‘I booked it as a surprise for Claire. It was a real treat and we giggled all the way there and back pretending to be famous.

‘Having the surgery really has changed our lives for the better in the end.’
