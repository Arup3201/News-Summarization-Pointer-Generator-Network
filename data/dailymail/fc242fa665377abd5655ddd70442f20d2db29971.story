If you are an actor or an engineer, you are more likely to be looking for casual sex than a long-term relationship, according to new research published by dating app Clover.

The newly-published survey, which polled more than 33,000 of the app’s users, aged between 18 and 60, on their relationship requirements, revealed that the majority of professionals fall into clear career stereotypes when it comes to their sexual desires - and states exactly which industries tend to be focused on friendship and romance, and which are more interested in quick flings and one-night stands.

While accountants, psychologists and nurses were deemed to be more likely to seek out long-term relationships, the app claims that actors and engineers aren’t often looking for anything more serious than a brief romantic encounter.

Other professions in the market for lasting love include pharmacists, designers and programmers.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, the majority of doctors and lawyers, many of whom have commit to extensive training before even qualifying, included in the survey said they were only looking for friends.

The most popular category to span the majority of professions was singles in search of a more casual relationship, with the majority of journalists, police officers, teachers, publicists, scientists, advertising professionals, construction workers and musicians, all falling under that same label.

But despite the clear evidence proving that our relationships are influenced by our career choices, Clover CEO Isaac Raichyk told MailOnline that the app's researchers haven't come up with any concrete theories to explain the results.

'But we feel how much free time you have and income might play a role,' he said. 'The fact that a lot of users seem to choose the casual intention might also be a way of playing it safe in order to ensure the best odds of meeting the most people.'

A second spokesperson for the app added that Clover's user base is 70per cent male and 30per cent female, and that respondents likely reflect that breakdown, though more specific demographics are unavailable.

In an effort to gather more information on whether people's jobs might affect their dating preference, Clover has asked its Twitter followers to share their thoughts.

Whitney Leigh Young echoed the poll's findings, tweeting: 'I'm an actor/journalist. And I'm looking for a casual hook-up.'

Caitlin Mooney, who identifies herself as a 'writer and quintessential PR girl', meanwhile, noted that she has a boyfriend despite having a job in the 'casual' category, writing: 'Hahah @mikeyryan23 we defied the odds.'

Clover, which launched in April, is a location-based dating app similar to Tinder in that users scroll through matches and indicate whether they're interested - but unlike Tinder, it allows users to revisit potential connections at a later time.
