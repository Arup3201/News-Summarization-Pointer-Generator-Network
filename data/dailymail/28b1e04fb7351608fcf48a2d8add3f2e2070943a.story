Nearly half of pupils from poorer backgrounds whose private school fees were paid by the last Tory government are now earning at least £90,000 a year.

More than 75,000 children took part in the Assisted Places Scheme, which ran for 17 years from 1980 before it was abolished by Labour.

A study revealed ‘virtually all’ have gone into well paid professional and managerial positions, including more than 40 per cent whose annual pay is £90,000 or more – nearly four times the national average salary of £24,000.

Two-thirds said the economic crisis had not affected their standard of living.

Even those who didn’t go on to university were still found to be in ‘solidly middle-class occupations with a good income’.

Most also reported they believed their schools had helped them develop important personal attributes including self-discipline and self-reliance.

The Sutton Trust, which campaigns to improve social mobility through education and commissioned the report, said its findings were powerful evidence that a similar scheme should be brought back.

Chairman Sir Peter Lampl said: ‘The new research shows the extent to which able children from less advantaged homes gain from an independent school education.

‘It shows the importance of ensuring that access to the best independent day schools is not restricted to those who can afford to pay full fees.’

The Assisted Places Scheme was launched during Margaret Thatcher’s first term in power and was open to bright pupils from low and middle-income homes in England and Wales whose parents could not afford full independent school fees.

The government paid a proportion of the fees, depending on the total income in the household. It was abolished by Tony Blair when he became prime minister in 1997.

Researchers have been following two groups of children with similar ability and parental background who qualified for the scheme. Some took up assisted places and others went to state schools.

Previous studies have shown those who went to independent schools did better in their public examinations.

And a third went on to elite universities, compared to less than one in ten who had studied at state schools.

The latest study by researchers at the Wales Institute for Social and Economic Research, found the benefits of the ‘private school premium’ continued into the workplace.

Three-quarters of respondents also said they expected to be even better off in ten years’ time and a ‘significant proportion’ expected to be able to retire early.

Report author Professor Sally Power said: ‘The relative unimportance the Assisted Place holders attach to factors such as luck and social background suggests that, for these individuals, the scheme alleviated the impact of socio-economic disadvantage.’

The Sutton Trust set up a similar scheme at Belvedere School in Liverpool from 2000 to 2007, with all places based on merit alone. The first pupils to sit exams at the girls’ school in 2005 achieved record results in their GCSEs.
