He's used to being chauffeur driven but Prince Charles has proved he's a dab hand behind the wheel as he test-drove a 4X4.

The
Prince of Wales was snapped in the driving seat of the green Land Rover Freelander on a 
visit to Kitridding Farm, near Kirkby Lonsdale, Cumbria yesterday.

The car firm has teamed up with the Prince's Countryside Fund to offer five Freelander 2 vehicles for a
year to individuals and groups who can prove they can put it to good 
use for the benefit of their community.

They
could be a young entrepreneur starting a rural enterprise, an 
apprentice hill farmer or an organisation offering free transport to 
rurally-isolated people.

Launching the scheme, the Prince showed off his driving skills as he 
drove one of the vehicles on a mini-Terrapod that uses
a combination of steep slopes, low friction surfaces and other 
obstacles to emphasise the grip and traction abilities of the vehicle.

Dressed in a tweed coat and olive 
green scarf and gloves, he smiled as he climbed behind the wheel - 
without a chauffeur in sight.

Just minutes later he'd completed the tricky maneuver with aplomb.

The Prince said said: 
'I want to use this opportunity to express my warmest possible gratitude
to Land Rover for their really remarkable generosity in ensuring we now
have this splendid scheme.

'This
is a wonderful act of generosity. It is the sort of willingness to 
become involved on the part of different companies which can make such a
fantastic difference, above all in ensuring we can maintain the 
priceless national asset which is our precious countryside. In 
particular, the upland areas which tends to be the ones that visitors 
want to go to - millions of them every year.

'The
important thing to remember is if we do not look after it, of course it
is the farmers who do much of that, then once that is lost you just 
cannot recreate it. It is not something you can start again so easily.

'So
far as I am concerned, the Countryside Fund will do its utmost to help 
the future of all of these smaller family farms and the rural 
community.'

The fund's 
director Victoria Harris said: 'We are excited about the variety of 
people and businesses that we are expecting to apply. 4x4 vehicles are 
crucial in helping rural businesses get around the countryside for their
daily business needs.'

Laura
Schwab, marketing director of Land Rover UK, said: 'Having reliable and
dependable transport to work in the countryside is essential and we 
hope these bursaries will benefit entrepreneurial farmers.'

Charles
set up the fund three years ago to support Britain's hard-pressed rural
areas. So far it has given more than £2.1 million in grants distributed
to 60 projects and directly benefiting nearly 40,000 people.

Earlier
this week, the fund authorised £219,000 from its emergency relief fund 
to help farmers during the Easter period following the recent cold snap 
and late arrival of spring.

He
said: 'I know at the moment that the farming community must be 
suffering the most awful difficulties and challenges, what with the 
weather and last year's awful difficulties again with the weather.

'On
top of that comes diseases of all kind and also rising prices, the beef
costs, and also the difficulties so many farmers have been experiencing
in not being able to drill their autumn crops and now with more 
difficulty in trying to drill the spring crops.

'And of course the snow now, the cold, lambing, people losing their lambs and sheeps...all of these things combining.

'What
we find is that the farming charities are experiencing more and more 
calls to their offices, in despair many of them at the situation they 
are facing. So that stress levels are rising all the time.'

Charles later enjoyed an hour-long tour of the historic market town of Kirkby Lonsdale which he last visited in 1993.

An
enthusiastic crowd braved the chilly temperatures to greet him as he 
walked around the market square and met stallholders, shopkeepers and 
well-wishers who lined Main Street.

One member of the public gave him an early Easter present of a Maltesers Easter egg.
