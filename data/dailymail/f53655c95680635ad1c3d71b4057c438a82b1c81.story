The detective who headed the Jimmy Savile inquiry is to investigate claims that up to 18 paedophile teachers abused dozens of young boys over five decades at a top public school.

Detective Inspector David Gray, who led the Metropolitan Police's Operation Yewtree, will command an investigation into claims that staff sexually abused pupils as young as nine as St Paul's School in central London and its preparatory school Colet Court.

Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne is among the former pupils of St Paul's, which was established in 1509 and is considered one of the leading schools in the country.

Allegations: The investigation was triggered by claims made by former pupils that staff sexually abused young boys at St Paul's School in central London and at its preparatory school Colet Court

Scene: Operation Winthorpe will focus on accusations from a number of former pupils that eight former schoolmasters at St Paul's and 10 at Colet Court (pictured) sexually abused dozens of young boys

The allegations were apparently reported to the police in recent weeks and focus on accusations from a number of former pupils that eight former schoolmasters sexually abused dozens of young boys between the mid-1960s and last year.

The victims are thought to have been aged between nine and 17, and were abused in dormitories, classrooms, a swimming pool, inside a car, and at teacher's home.

The inquiry comes just months after classics teacher Anthony Fuggle, 57, resigned his post after he was arrested and bailed on suspicion of possession of indecent images.

According to The Times, detectives have already compiled a list of 100 victims, suspects and potential witnesses following the claims against the former schoolmasters - some of whom are no longer alive.

The paper also revealed that a second teacher, Tim Harbord, 61, was arrested on suspicion of grooming a child. However he was not charged and denies the allegations.

The involvement of Mr Gray, who is the head of Scotland Yard's paedophile unit, will be to oversee the carrying out of a 'thorough and transparent review' of alleged sexual abuse at the two schools.

He said: 'The investigation will be conducted by a dedicated team of specially-trained officers who have experience of historic child abuse investigations and are sensitive to the needs of the victims.'

Operation Winthorpe officers have set up
 a telephone hotline and dedicated email address to allow former pupils 
to come forward with any relevant information that could help the 
investigation.

In

suspicion of indecently

assaulting a pupil in the 1970s. He denies any 
wrongdoing.

In
 the same month his former colleague Keith Perry, 70, was given a 
suspended sentence for possessing hundreds of vile images of extreme 
child abuse.

Mr Fuggle, who left his post in September, was reportedly arrested on suspicion of possessing indecent images of young boys, some of which may have been stored on a school computer. He is currently on bail.

The investigation into Mr Fuggle is 
believed to have been sparked when photographs of boys were found on a 
school computer during IT checks.

Alan Doggett, a choirmaster who helped launch the 
careers of Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice has been named was also named as one of the teachers involved in the abuse of children as young as ten.

The teacher, who committed suicide in 1978, is 
believed to have been a serial abuser while teaching at Colet Court - 
even making sex attacks part of his choir's audition process for some boys.

After he left Colet Court he was given a job at the equally prestigious City of London School 
but threw himself under a train when he was charged with the indecent 
assault of a ten-year-old boy.

The 
Metropolitan Police began looking into historical claims after a number 
of pupils who attended the school between the 1960s and 1980s came 
forward with new information.

Abuse: Detective David Gray headed Operation Yewtree, the investigation into the crimes of Jimmy Savile

Officers confirmed they made their first arrest earlier this summer before bringing a man into custody.

The
 school was founded in 1509 and moved from its original site near St 
Paul's Cathedral to its current riverside campus in Barnes, south west 
London in 1968.

According to its website, fees are £10,411 for a term of boarding and £6,951 per term of days. An Ofsted inspection in March 2013 described quality of learning at the school as 'exceptional'.

A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police said: 'We can confirm that due to the level of complexity involved, this investigation is now being conducted by the Metropolitan Police Service's Paedophile Unit.

'Under Operation Winthorpe, detectives continue to consider a number of allegations of non-recent sexual abuse alleged to have taken place in the Barnes area.
