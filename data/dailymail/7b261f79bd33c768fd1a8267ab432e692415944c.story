This is the dramatic moment police arrested a drugs courier after a police chase - an operation that led to a big time  cocaine dealer being put behind bars.

Mark Dainty, 46, who lived the high life from the profits of his evil trade has been jailed for nine and a half years.

He drove a high-powered BMW and bought top of the range motorbikes and a speedboat. He also took his glamorous girlfriend on numerous sunshine holidays to exotic locations.

But now the gang leader who believed he was too clever for the police is behind bars after a long term under cover operation ended with a dramatic car chase as a helicopter hovered overhead.

At Gloucester Crown Court, Dainty was jailed for nine and a half years and three of his henchmen received sentences of between four and five and a half years at the same hearing.

The court was told that police kept observations on Dainty's gang transporting cocaine regularly between Leicester and Gloucester over a two year period.

When police finally pounced on his courier van they seized around half a kilo of cocaine with a potential street value in excess of £100,000.

Officers allege that as a whole the conspiracy involved drugs with a potential street value of £250,000.

Officers also seized Dainty's Bayliner speedboat worth more than £25,000. It had a newly-fitted sound system costing £2,500. They also seized a high-spec motorbike.

Dainty, of Gloucester, had been running a motorcycle shop, Dockside Superbikes, as a cover for his illicit trade.

He pleaded guilty to conspiracy to supply cocaine and money laundering.

The police operation began in early 2011. On Thursday, April 21, 2011, Gloucestershire Police traced one of the group's couriers, Erik Thomas, 32, of Yate, Bristol, as he travelled in a Ford Transit van between Worcester, Leicester and Gloucester.

As he left the M5 at junction 12 near
Gloucester officers stopped his vehicle. Thomas tried to escape the 
blockade and drove dangerously onto the other carriageway in the face of
oncoming traffic.

He then 
pulled into a gateway, flinging the cocaine into a hedge as he did so. 
Several police vehicles swooped in behind him and armed officers leapt 
out pointing their weapons at his van.

Thomas, wearing just a pair of shorts, then emerged from the van, walked out onto the road and lay face down on the road to be handcuffed.

The package was recovered and discovered to be 246 grams of high purity (around 73 per cent) cocaine. Thomas was arrested on suspicion of supply of the class A drug.

Donna Gittings, 27, of Worcester, who 
was travelling in the van with him was also arrested on suspicion of 
possession of a class A drug.

She could be seen in the video emerging from the van after Thomas and kneeling on the road with her hands behind her head.

Following
Thomas' arrest the police investigation continued and on Wednesday 
September 7, 2011, Gloucestershire Police, supported by colleagues from 
Avon and Somerset Police and Leicestershire Police, carried out further 
arrests.

In total, seven 
people have been put before the courts as a result of the investigation 
by Gloucestershire Police's Serious and Organised Crime Unit.

Erik
Thomas entered a guilty plea to the charge of conspiracy to supply 
cocaine. He was sentenced to four years nine months for the drugs 
offence and nine months for dangerous driving and has been banned from 
driving for two and a half years.

Raphael
Franks, 27, of Leicester, who was a courier in the gang, admitted 
conspiracy to supply cocaine. He was sentenced to four years 
imprisonment.

Jason Edie, 
28, of Leicester, also pleaded guilty to conspiracy to supply cocaine. 
He was sentenced to five years four months in prison.

Donna Gittings pleaded guilty to possession of a class A drug and was sentenced to a nine month community order.

The
first arrest of the operation came on January 20, 2011, when another of
the group's couriers was arrested. Gary Hooper, 39, of Tuffley, 
Gloucester, was later charged with possession with intent to supply a 
class A drug and was jailed for four years in May 2011.

Dainty's
girlfriend, Paula Cutts, 30, of Tuffley, Gloucester, was also arrested 
as part of the investigation. She was charged with money laundering 
offences and was issued with a formal caution.

Gloucestershire
Police have released dramatic footage of Thomas' arrest to act as a 
warning to those involved in the use and supply of illegal drugs.

Detective
Inspector Neil Carpenter, of the Serious and Organised Crime Unit, 
said: 'This investigation disrupted a major supply route of cocaine into
the county and my team have convicted the main person responsible.

'Dainty
was living a luxury lifestyle with the illicit money he made by 
orchestrating the supply of cocaine and we're pleased to have both him 
and this harmful substance off our streets.

'The
footage we've released of one of the arrests shows the moment when one 
of Dainty's couriers Erik Thomas was captured and his poor attempt to 
dispose of the evidence.

'Our
investigation tracked the organisation as they sourced cocaine from 
Leicester and painstaking detective work and analysis also identified 
the persons who were supplying Dainty and they too were forced to plead 
guilty in light of the mass of evidence against them.

'Force
boundaries are no issue in these types of investigation as we aim to 
dismantle and disrupt whole criminal conspiracies. Proceeds of Crime Act
hearings will follow to hopefully strip people of any profit they have 
made.'
