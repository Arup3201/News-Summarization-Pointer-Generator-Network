John Collins has no worries over race row Celtic player Aleksandar Tonev ahead of their opening Europa League clash with Salzburg in Austria on Thursday night.

Scottish FA compliance officer Vincent Lunny is looking into the allegation that the Bulgarian forward racially abused Aberdeen full-back Shay Logan during Saturday's Premiership fixture at Celtic Park which the home side won 2-1 to register their first win in five games.

Afterwards a Celtic spokesman said: 'We have spoken to the player and he has stated that the accusation made is not true.'

Celtic assistant manager John Collins says the club are not concerned about the allegations against Tonev

The Bulgarian midfielder Aleksandar Tonev denies that he used racist language towards Shay Logan

Speaking at Glasgow Airport before the Scottish champions flew out to Austria, Hoops' assistant Collins said: 'He will be fine for the game. The club has made a statement and so we will move forward.'

Stand-in captain Charlie Mulgrew is out with a knee injury while winger James Forrest remains out with a hamstring injury.

Defenders Mikael Lustig is out with groin injury and Adam Matthews is missing with a calf injury while new loan signing from Manchester City John Guidetti has to drop out as he was not registered in time.

Collins is glad to see the return of skipper Scott Brown who made his first appearance of the season against Aberdeen after recovering from a hamstring injury.

John Collins praised his captain Scott Brown and said it was like having two or three players back in the side

He said: 'It is great to have him back. Anyone who was at the game on Saturday or watched it on television, he brings so much experience, legs, power, skill and drives other players forward.

'It is like having two or three players back when Scott is back in the park.'

The former Celtic midfielder is looking for Celtic to go all the way in the competition after being knocked out of the Champions League qualifiers.

He said: 'I want to get to the final and win and if you ask the same question to the players I am sure they will give you the same answer.

'There are a lot of good teams in the tournament but we will give it our best shot.

'We don't have a point to prove but we want to improve.

'We are all bitterly disappointed that we didn't qualify for the Champions League but you move on to the next challenge and the next challenge is Salzburg.

'It is a good challenge for us but we are confident of getting a result.

'I don't think a draw would be a bad result. We will have all the teams back at Celtic Park but we want to win every game.'
