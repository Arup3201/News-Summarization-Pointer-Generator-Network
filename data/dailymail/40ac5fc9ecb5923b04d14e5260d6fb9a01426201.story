It may not have been a tie that had supporters licking their lips with anticipation, but for the 300 Hearts fans who did turn up to their pre-season friendly with Dinamo Bucharest in Leigh certainly got their fair share of entertainment.

A change of kick-off time and venue would usually be more than enough drama for one afternoon, but when opposition supporters proceed to throw beer cans and fire crackers on the pitch at half-time then you know it is an unusual game of football.

Dinamo supporters withdrew banners and then were promptly kicked out of the Leigh Sports Village venue when they threw beer cans and fire crackers on to the pitch at half-time.

Angry: Frustrated Dinamo Bucharest fans prepare to throw firecrackers on pitch during friendly with Hearts

Boom: The firecrackers exploded on the pitch during half-time of the pre-season friendly

Escalation: Beer bottles were also thrown on by rogue Dinamo fans as the firecrackers continued to explode

Messages: The Dinamo fans had already unfurled banners at the match showing support for their team

Farce: The missiles were just one of an extended series of incidents at the game

Incidents: The venue and kick-off time were changed and Dinamo's captain was sent off for charging at the referee, before the Romanians sent on another player to replace him until the officials noticed

The Romanian fans remained, peering through a perimeter fence to catch the second half of a fixture they had paid a hefty Â£10 to watch, and even tried to get back into the venue.

But the reason for Dinamo's frustrations was down to their captain Laurentiu Rus, who was dismissed for hurtling towards the referee from 15 yards and pushing him to the ground.

He refused to leave the field, however, and Dinamo proceeded to bring on another player to even up the numbers without the referee noticing.

Number 35 played for several minutes before the officials noticed and asked him to leave the field of play.

Amazingly, before kick-off the tie was switched from Leigh Harriers' athletics ground after shot put damage forced the pitch to be deemed unplayable.

The venue switch also caused a 30-minute delay to the start of the match, something which further frustrated Dinamo fans.

Hearts eventually won the match 2-1.

Victory: Hearts did manage to win the pre-season friendly 2-1 despite all the distractions
