These incredible images of old baseballs come in a remarkable range of shapes and appearances as years of decay have taken their toll.

For years keen photographer Don Hamerman walked his dog near an old baseball diamond where he would pick up discarded old balls.

He bought them back to his studio in Stamford, Connecticut, where they sat for years until he decided to start photographing them.

Out of this world: The patterns of decay on this
old baseball look remarkably similar to the continents North and South 
America as seen in satellite photographs

Collection: For years keen photographer Don Hamerman walked his dog near an old baseball diamond where he would pick up discarded old balls. Then he finally decided to immortalise them in this unique set

Beaten: In this photo the baseball's wool windings are bursting out, perhaps after some mammoth strike

Curious: Mr Hamerman, who ironically hasn't been to a game for about ten years, admits he cares more about aesthetics than history. These two remarkable examples show the different kinds of balls in use

Home run! An official Major League basebal 
consists of a round cork centre, wrapped tightly in windings of wool and
polyester or cotton yarn, covered by stitched leather

Innards: Wool is the most-used material for the 
windings because its natural resilience and 'memory' means it compresses
when pressure is applied before rapidly returning to its original shape

Mr Hamerman, who ironically hasn't been to a game for about ten years, admits he cares more about aesthetics than history.

'I collected them more for the way they look than the sport itself - there is something quite fascinating about them,' he said.

'Some people have said it reminds them of connecting to their childhood. I just think what appeals to me is what appeals to other people too. They are just cool.'

To be accepted for use in competition each must weigh between five and five-and-a-quarter ounces and have a circumference of between nine and nine-and-a-quarter inches.

Range of shapes: The battered baseball on the left looks like it could almost be a face. The one on the right looks like it might explode if you put a match to the stitching poking out from its top

Grotesque: This beaten baseball bears a remarkable resemblance to a Halloween monster, with it's mouth half stitched together and two unevenly placed, malevolent eyes peering back

Decaying: Mr Hamerman insists he doesn't 
manipulate anything about his found baseballs, although he does try to 
preserve some live moss when it appears

Running out: Mr Hamerman says he's exhausted the supply of baseballs from the old diamond near his home in Stamford, Connecticut, and now has to collect baseballs when he's travelling elsewhere

Just rubber composite: This cheaper model baseball would be unlikely to pass the Major League's criteria

The patterns of decay sprawl across Mr Hamerman's battered baseballs - with one bearing an uncanny resemblance to a map of North and South America.

But Mr Hamerman insists he doesn't manipulate anything about them, although he does try to preserve some live moss when it appears.

'I have exhausted the field near my house so now I have to collect balls when I travel,' he added.

'Although there is one half-buried and growing moss in a local park. I know right where to find it if I ever need to.'
