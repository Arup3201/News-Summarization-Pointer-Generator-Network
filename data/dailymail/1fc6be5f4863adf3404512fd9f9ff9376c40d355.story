It's notoriously difficult to get students excited about science but one teacher has found a winning formula - taking them to McDonalds.

Caroline Molyneux has students flocking to her revision classes at weekends with her cunning combination of biology and fast food.

Working from Sharples High School, Bolton, Greater Manchester, she said students can munch on ice creams, breakfast or lunch while they work through past papers.

'We stage revision sessions in school and we started this one a month ago. It has been really successful. It is quite relaxed and informal and the pupils stay for quite a bit.' she said.

'Some have their breakfast or their lunch, and there are ice-creams on hand as we look through past papers.'

And her somewhat unorthodox commitment to helping students study their biology GCSE papers has seen her shortlisted for an award.

Her dedication to inspiring the next generation has her shortlisted for the prestigious 2014 School Biology Teacher of the Year Award - just one of three nominated nationwide.

The award recognises the 'very best and most inspiring biology teachers'.

'I was put forward for the award at my old school - Balshaw in Leyland,' she said.

'They kept it from me until I was shortlisted. I’m just one of three people - it was a big surprise.

'The assessors visited Sharples High School and spoke to the pupils - it is always nice to be nominated but it’s fantastic that this is because of student nominations.'

The assistant headteacher has been 
teaching for nine years, but has a background as a researcher at the 
University of Molecular Microbiology.

She now teaches biology, chemistry and astronomy and is an educational leader for the National Space Agency.

She is also not scared to lay down a challenge: 'If anyone tells me they don’t like science, I will find out why. Here we make science exciting and interesting.

'Balshaw is an outstanding school and Sharples is on its way to being outstanding. I wanted to be part of that.

'I think teaching is a vocation, and not just a job. I love it and to support the children in helping them get the most out of their five years in school.'

Dr Mark Downs, chief executive of the Society of Biology, said: 'Excellent teachers have a profound positive effect on their students’ learning, career choices and aspirations.

'It is rewarding to know that once again, the entrants for this award are teaching outstanding and innovative lessons which inspire their students.'
