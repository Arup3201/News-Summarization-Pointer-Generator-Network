Fiona Anderson fell to her death in April after she allegedly killed her three children

A heavily pregnant woman who is believed to have killed her three children before she fell to her death left messages on the walls of her home asking for them to be buried together.

Fiona Anderson had written notes saying that she loved her children and would 'keep them safe' shortly before she died last month.

Officers found her children - Levina, three, Addy, two, and 11-month-old Kyden - dead at their home in Lowestoft, Suffolk.

Ms Anderson suffered fatal head injuries after she fell to her death from a multy-storey carpark on April 15.

The parents of the 23-year-old appealed to the father of the 
children to grant Ms Anderson's last wish.

Ms Anderson's father Michael Anderson said in a pre-recorded interview shown on ITV's Daybreak this morning: 'She'd written that the children were asleep in their bed all together, all tucked up with their bears.

'They were all looking very peaceful and happy together.

'And she also wrote "please bury us together, we want to be together to keep them safe".'

The father of the children, Craig McLelland, reportedly does not want his children to be buried with their mother.

Mr McLelland had recently separated from Ms Anderson, who was depressed at the time of her death, according to neighbours.

The heartbroken mother said she reacted with disbelief when she heard the news of Fiona and her children's deaths

Mr Anderson said: 'We must understand that that was not Fiona, Fiona would never have done anything to hurt her children.

'So that evening, Fiona, whatever happened, she had in her mind that what she was doing was correct.

'She was looking after the children 
and she wants to be with the children to look after them still. 
Everybody must understand that.'

Her mother Kerry said Fiona seemed happy when she last saw her.

Mrs Anderson said: 'She adored the children. Everything was the children, they were just everything to her.'

The heartbroken mother said she reacted with disbelief when she heard the news, saying: 'Things like that just don't happen.'

Both
parents were emotional during their interview, and Mr Anderson said 
they would be unable to move on from their grief until their daughter is
buried.

He said: 'Until we can actually bury our daughter we can't even comprehend going forward.'

Speaking
on ITV's Daybreak this morning, Mirror columnist Fiona Phillips, who 
interviewed Michael and Kerry Anderson, said: 'Obviously Craig, the 
children's father, must be hurting too and Michael and Kerry realise 
that and the reason they wanted to do this interview is they're 
appealing to Craig.'

At the
time of her tragic death, Fiona's parents and her sisters Claire and 
Laura Anderson said that 'life was sometimes overwhelming' for her.

In
a statement, they said: 'Fiona was a beautiful, intelligent girl and a 
loving and caring person, but she had suffered from mental illness since
she was young and we believe she was driven to her actions yesterday.

This was not our Fiona - she was not
herself. She cared passionately about others but often brought stress 
on herself by caring too much. She was gentle but ended up under too 
much pressure.

'As a 
family we were close but she would often push us away, keen to do her 
own thing and not to listen when we offered support. Life was sometimes 
overwhelming for her.'

They
added: 'She was really popular but just didn't believe she was and had 
forgotten there were people there that could help her.

'We wish more had been done to recognise her mental health problems.'

The inquest into the deaths of Ms Anderson and her children was adjourned last month.
