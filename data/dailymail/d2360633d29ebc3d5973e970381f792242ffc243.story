 A conwoman has admitted trying to sell a mews house in an exclusive area of London for £1 million - right under its real owner’s nose.

Monika Brzezinska, 28, used false identity documents to pretend to be the lawful owner of a home in Clarendon Mews, in Bayswater, west London, in November last year.

The Polish national appeared at Southwark Crown Court wearing a long black skirt and black top with a beige coat draped over her arm.

Speaking through a Polish interpreter, she admitted one count of fraud and two counts of possessing false identity documents relating to a bogus passport and driving licence.

Benjamin Khoury, 26, pleaded guilty to one count of fraud earlier this year.

Jamara Pacskowska, 56, denies the charges and will face trial in April.

Addressing Brzezinska Judge Alistair McCreath said: ‘I will not sentence you today.

‘In part because the court will want to know more about you before your sentence and I have therefore ordered a pre-sentence report.’

At an earlier hearing prosecutor Peter Zinner said the defendants ‘adopted the identity’ of the lawful owner and had created the fake identity documents to support the sale of this property on Clarendon Mews, Bayswater, last November, for £1 million

Brzezinska of Croydon, admitted one count of fraud and two counts of possessing false identity documents and was released on bail ahead of her sentence.

Pacskowska, also of Croydon, was released on bail ahead of a trial later this year.
