They might have spent the last two weeks in a £14,000 Caribbean villa but, laden with bags and carrying their young son, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge looked very much like any other set of parents as they strode through St. Lucia's tiny airport.

The family was seen boarding a British Airways plane as they prepared to travel back to London, following their annual holiday on the island of Mustique.

Kate, who is almost seven months pregnant, and William were on the island to celebrate Carole Middleton's 60th birthday on the 31st January, as well as for a final family break before they become parents for a second time in April.

On their way: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge board a British Airways plane en route to London

18-month-old George was carried up the steps by his mother, who looked comfortable in a loose navy shirt and skinny jeans, and wore her hair scraped back.

William, meanwhile, got the job of carrying the  hand luggage and clutched a £74.95 floral-print holdall from Joules as he made his way into the plane behind one of the couple's two protection officers.

The couple have spent the last two weeks at the Villa Rocina on the secluded island of Mustique, with the Middleton clan, including James, 27, and Pippa, 31.

They were there for Mrs Middleton's birthday celebrations, which, according to sources, was fun, informal and noisy and included bespoke cocktails created especially for the event.

Along with Pippa and James, rumoured guests included Basil Charles, the owner of Mustique's much-loved Basil's Bar, and the island's resident doctor Michael Bunbury and his wife Lotty.

Long journey: The flying time back to London is around eight hours - a long time for a toddler like George

What a gentleman the Duke of Cambridge is. Whilst we can't quite see what the Duchess is wearing to fly home from their annual holiday on the island of Mustique, luckily we can get a load of the couples' luggage!

Ask any parent and they'll tell you that when travelling on a long haul flight with a one-year-old, only a bag of Mary Poppins proportions will do. And who better to turn to than cult brand Cath Kidston, whose vintage-inspired floral prints have got countless fans, including our favourite little prince?

We spotted Catherine carrying a polka dot print Cath Kidston holdall when en route to Canada, plus of course the guardsman print tank top that gorgeous little George wore in his official Christmas portrait was by the brand.

We love the contrast stripe print strap on this style, as well as the perfectly sized pockets. Unfortunately, it is now all sold out, but click (right) to buy a very similar version by clicking right.

Those not invited included Mrs Middleton's brother Gary Goldsmith, whose colourful lifestyle has proved embarrassing on occasion.

Also off the guest list was James' girlfriend Donna Air, 35, and Pippa's boyfriend Nico Jackson, also 35, who were dropped due to limited space at Villa Rocina.

The couple are heading back for the start of an intense period of engagements, beginning with the Duchess of Cambridge's visit to Hampshire on Thursday.

32-year-old William is currently studying for the pilot's licence that will enable him to fly EC145 T2 aircraft when he joins the East Anglia Air Ambulance Service this summer.

Although the prince is already qualified to fly a Sea King helicopter, his new role requires five months of training, which he is currently completing, 14 exams and a flight test.

Break: The Cambridges have been enjoying a two-week break in Mustique with the Middleton clan

Celebration: The holiday also included a 60th birthday celebration for Mrs Middleton

Busy: Kate, who is almost seven months pregnant, will have a busy run of engagements on her return

Once qualified, he will be part of the team who fly day and night shifts and attend a variety of emergencies, ranging from road crashes to heart attacks.

The Duke's new job will require him to spend more time in Norfolk, where he and the Duchess of Cambridge have their new home, Anmer House. 

With its sugar-sand beaches and gently swaying palms, it's no surprise that the Caribbean has proved a hit with holidaying royalty.

A particular favourite is St Barts, which earlier this year saw Princess Beatrice arrive on its shores for a break.

Part of the Leeward Islands, the island is one of four that make up the French West Indies, and is home to popular celebrity haunts such as Maya's, a beachside restaurant just outside the capital Gustavia.

‘The Caribbean island of St Barts is synonymous with the rich and famous, from Beyonce and Jay-Z to Roman Abramovich,' says MailOnline acting travel editor, Sarah Gordon.

Favourite: Princess Margaret owned a home on Mustique and spent much of her time there

While celebrities are certainly seen here, it is the ultra-wealthy media moguls and steel magnates who really love to splash out on holidays in this exclusive spot.

‘All of that makes it perfect for the royals, who can enjoy the island’s relative privacy and lack of “riff raff” – the island can be difficult and pricy to reach, ensuring most holidaymakers head elsewhere.'

Almost as popular with the royal set is the exclusive island of Mustique, which in January last year, was the scene of Prince George's first ever trip abroad.

While the little prince stayed in a rented villa with his Middleton relatives and did so again this year, his great aunt Princess Margaret, another royal fond of a Mustique break, sunned in style in the garden of the villa she owned on the island.
