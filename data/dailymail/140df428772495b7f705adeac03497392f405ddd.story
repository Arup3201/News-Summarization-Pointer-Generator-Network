Kurtley Beale has been stood down from all forms of rugby indefinitely following the revelation he sent 'highly inappropriate and deeply offensive' text messages and images relating to a Wallabies staff member.

At a press conference on Thursday afternoon, ARU CEO Bill Pulver confirmed that the integrity unit is investigating a second, more serious allegation against Beale, and the controversial rugby star will not be considered for selection until the hearing has concluded.

'This matter relates to Kurtley Beale allegedly distributing what we consider to be highly inappropriate and deeply offensive text messages and images to a number of people in June, referencing an ARU staff member,' Pulver told a news conference.

'We became aware of this incident this week and believe an independent tribunal is the appropriate forum for these allegations to be considered.'

The new incident was raised for the first time with ARU management on Tuesday, leading to the code of conduct tribunal hearing to be chaired by District Court judge Mark Williams.

Beale, whose future in the game is now on shaky ground, will not be considered for Test selection before the end the tribunal hearing, set down for next week.

He will miss Saturday week's third Bledisloe Test against New Zealand at Suncorp Stadium.

The hearing will investigate texts and images which were sent from Beale to other members in the team environment, which were then 'inadvertently sent to the staff member concerned', according to Mr Pulver.  

Bill Pulver addresses the media to address the new incident and ask questions about the integrity unit investigation, the impending hearing and Kurtley Beale's future

Pulver says, 'a date for the hearing will be set in the coming days and is anticipated to take place early next week.'

Kurtley Beale has been stood down from all forms of rugby and will face a code of conduct tribunal hearing early next week into the new, 'more serious' matter

Beale, whose future in the game is now on shaky ground, will not be considered for Test selection before the end the tribunal hearing, set down for next week. 

Beale was already facing disciplinary charges for being involved in a verbal altercation with Wallabies business manager Di Patston, while travelling from Johannesburg to Sao Paolo the day after the side's 28-10 loss to the Springboks in Cape Town.

The 25-year-old was dropped for Australia's match against Argentina.

Mr Pulver confirmed at Thursday's press conference Ms Patston is on 'indefinite sick leave.' 

'Our number one concern right now is getting (Di Patston) back to health,' said Mr Pulver. 

'The investigation into the argument on the plane has become a secondary matter in recent days, with our focus diverted to these new allegations.' 

'A date for the hearing will be set in the coming days and is anticipated to take place early next week.' 

Mr Pulver said he is disappointed that the incident has taken place, as the team are a 'mature' group of men who generally have a great understanding of the danger of social media and picture sharing.

Mr Pulver said he is disappointed that the incident has taken place, as the team are a 'mature' group of men who generally have a great understanding of the danger of social media, picture sharing, as well as of ethical behaviour.

'By and large we don't have these sorts of issues because it's a mature group who… understand these issues intricately.

'That's why it's such a shock. It's such a silly thing to happen.'

Mr Pulver says he is confident that the Wallabies do have the right team culture.

'Culture and discipline are an important aspect of a successful team environment and by and large I think we've got that.'

The ARU CEO was quick to emphasise that the controversial player will be subject to a fair proceeding and will be given the chance to defend himself.

'His history is his history but whether or not that will impact on proceedings, I can't say,' Mr Pulver said on Thursday.
