A video shows the incredible moment a herd of buffalo save one of their own from being devoured from a pack of hungry lions after it became separated from the herd.

The footage, which was taken in South Africa's Kruger National Park, shows four lions clambering over the lone buffalo and clawing at the weak animal while it falls to the ground.

One lion clasps its huge paws around the buffalo's neck, while the others bite as its legs, back and belly, as the pack prepares to feast on their prey.

Four fearless buffalo come storming onto the scene to rescue the stragler from the jaws of the lions

But just as it seems like all hope is lost, four fearless buffalo come storming onto the scene. One instantly charges at the group of lions headbutting them off the buffalo and sending the big cats scattering.

One brave lion refuses to let go of its dinner for, before another buffalo charges and it chooses to scarper rather than get rammed for a second time.

The weak buffalo scrambles to its feet and trots off to safety while the others stand guard to ensure the lions do not return to finish the kill.

The video was filmed by South African tourist Ronell Van Der Merwe and was posted online yesterday by Latest Sightings, a company which shares videos of happenings in Kruger National Park.
