A woman has revealed her horrific injuries after she was attacked by a pack of raccoons who knocked her to the ground and bit chunks out of her skin while she was walking her dog.

Gruesome images show the scores of deep gashes covering Michaela Lee's arms and legs that each needed staples, injections and treatment against rabies.

The 28-year-old sustained the lacerations when her dog chased several raccoons up a tree in Fort Steilacoom Park in Lakewood, Washington after he got loose - and they returned to attack.

When she went to grab the dog's 
leash, several raccoons began scratching her legs and when she ran away,
 they chased her 75 feet, before knocked her to the ground and biting 
her.

'I was trying to run to a neighbour's
 front door but the raccoons were between my legs and they tripped me 
and I fell,' she told KOMO News.

'They were on top of me, just biting my arms and legs and sides. I was just trying not to let them get to my face.'

Her six-year-old American dingo, 
Madison, eventually scared them off by barking and snarling, giving Lee 
the chance to grab one by the scruff of its neck and throw it away.

Raccoons, which are nocturnal animals, are known to attack dogs left outside homes at night, yet attacks on humans are rare.

Animal Control said it is likely a female raccoon felt threatened by Lee or her dog and tried to protect her young.

Those attacked by raccoons will need medical care as they carry diseases and parasites.

Although cases are rare, raccoons carry rabies, which attacks muscle function and is deadly if not treated immediately.

Another worry is the raccoon roundworm, which spreads to people by inhalation of roundworm eggs from raccoon feces. It can cause serious damage to the nervous system and death.

Neighbour Michael Parks said he heard 
Lee screaming and saw her on the ground.

He called 911 and stayed with 
two other neighbors to help her.

Lee, was treated for about 16 puncture wounds and numerous scratches, The News Tribune said.

She has needed staples in her arm and leg and has started a round of rabies treatment, although the disease is rare in raccoons in the area.

She told KOMO News that the worst part of the ordeal was having injections in every single one of the gashes - some without anesthetic.Â 

The treatment is expected to cost her thousands of dollars.

Parks
 said the raccoons have been in the area since he moved there 17 years 
ago.

They are sometimes violent towards each other, but he has never 
known them to attack humans.

Lee is determined to carry on using the park, but next time she will take precautions.

'I got some bear mace and I'm not going to be afraid to use it if they come after me again,' she said.
