The brother of Olympic wrestling champion Dave Schultz, who was shot dead in 1996 by multimillionaire John du Pont, has said it has taken him 18 years to come to terms with his brother’s senseless murder.

Foxcatcher is a Hollywood film that tells the incredible true story of Mark Schultz and his brother’s strange relationship with du Pont which ended when the eccentric philanthropist shot Dave Schultz dead on the driveway of his 800-acre farm in Delaware County, Pennsylvania.

The film, based on Mark's newly released memoir, is out this week and stars Channing Tatum as Mark, Steve Carell as du Pont, and Mark Ruffalo as Dave.

The memoir of Mark Schultz, left with Channing Tatum, tells the story of his brother Dave Schultz's, top right, tragic murder at the hands of John du Pont in 1996

‘I decided to write my autobiography because I didn’t want Dave to be forgotten,’ Mark Schultz, now 54, of Medford, Ore., told the New York Post.

‘It was a tough decision for me as I’ve always been a man of few words.’

The film, and Mark’s book, tells the incredible true story of how these championship-winning brothers managed to fall in with the wealthiest convicted murderer of all time.

It starts in the mid-80s when du Pont approached Mark Schultz, an Olympic gold medalist and world champion, and invited him to his Foxcatcher Farms estate to  put together a wrestling team for future Olympics.

Mark, who says his opportunities at the time were limited, jumped at the chance although he now says he regretted the decision almost immediately after.

‘Looking back, I should have trusted my gut and never let him into my life - or, indeed, the life of my brother a few years later,’ said Schultz.

‘Everything about him was weird, from the dyed red Ronald McDonald hair with layers of dandruff in the roots to his dark yellow teeth, caked with food. Within weeks of working for him, I realized I’d made a huge mistake.’

Despite his bad feeling, the two men formed an odd bond that was a mixture of friendship and unspoken sexual tension, but ultimately du Pont’s erratic moods became too much for Schultz and he walked out in 1988.

‘I couldn’t look myself in the mirror and continue to work for du Pont or live on his estate. That was his whole strategy in his friendships and business relationships - to see how much money people would accept from him and how much they’d compromise themselves,’ said Schultz.

To replace him, du Pont simply turned to Schultz’s older brother Dave who also had an Olympic gold medal and world title to his name.

Tragedy stuck on January 26, 1996, when John du Pont shot Dave Schultz three times at close range on the grounds of his 800-acre Foxcatcher farm in Delaware County, Pennsylvania

In 1989, Dave Schultz and his young family moved into a house on the grounds of the Foxcatcher estate.

Du Pont’s erratic behaviour continued to deteriorate and tragedy struck on January 26, 1996, when he shot Dave Schultz three times at close range.

The murder was witnessed by Schultz's wife and du Pont's head of security and afterwards the multimillionaire locked himself inside his mansion for two days.

Police negotiated with him on the phone before switching off his power and eventually arresting him when he ventured outside to fix his heater.

‘When my dad called to tell me that Dave had been killed, I threw the phone and destroyed everything in my office,’ said Mark. ‘Then, I curled into a ball and cried. I must have cried for a week.’

Steve Carell stars as eccentric philanthropist John du Pont in the movie

Du Pont, who was found to be mentally ill but not insane, was convicted in 1997 of murdering Dave Schult and died in prison in 2010

No motive was ever offered for the murder, although friends had noted Du Pont was acting erratically beforehand, and an expert witness testified he was a paranoid schizophrenic who thought Schultz was going to kill him.

Du Pont, who was found to be mentally ill but not insane, was convicted in 1997 of murdering Dave Schult in the third degree after the court rejected his plea of not guilty by reason of insanity.

He died of acute aspiration pneumonia in prison in 2010, aged 72.

Now 18 years later, Mark Schultz says the process of writing his memoir and working on the film has helped him come to terms with his brother's death.

‘I spent nearly a week on set. Watching Steve Carell play du Pont was like coming face-to-face again with the man who broke our family’s heart,' he said.
