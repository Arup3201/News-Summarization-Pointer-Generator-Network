More people were killed by crocodiles in the Northern Territory in 2014 than any other year since records began, and there will be more deaths, a wildlife ranger says.

Saltwater crocodiles killed four Territorians last year, which is almost one-fifth of the total 21 people killed since 1974.

This also comes as a significant number of saltwater crocodiles were captured by the Northern Territory's Parks and Wildlife Commission.

In 2014, the NT crocodile management team removed 287 saltwater crocodiles from the territory's waterways, up from 226 in 2013.

Wildlife ranger Tom Nichols said last year's number was close to toppling the most number of crocodiles ever caught, which is 318 in 2012.

2014's numbers meant more than five saltwater crocodiles were removed from the Top End's waterways every week.

Mr Nichols told AAP last year's number of crocodile deaths were concerning.

'This is the highest number of fatalities in one year since it's been recorded,' he said.

Most of those deaths were due to negligence in crocodile-infested waters, Mr Nichols said, and it was possible residents were becoming complacent, with more people out on the waterways, and high crocodile numbers.

'We're trying to get the CrocWise message across as best as possible, but unfortunately we will get another [death], we just don't know when,' he said.

'Stay away from the water, don't put your hands near the water, use hooks or nets to retrieve fish from the water.

'When you're fishing from the banks stay five metres back from the water's edge, don't have your camp close to the water.'

Three-quarters of last year's saltwater crocodiles were trapped in Darwin Harbour, with two over four metres long.

The largest crocodile caught in 2014 was 4.75m long at Daly River - south of Darwin - on December 16.

But Mr Nichols hosed down speculation about a cull, saying it was a decision to be made by the federal government, which listed saltwater crocodiles as a protected species in 1971.

It could negatively impact the NT crocodile industry, which is worth about $20 million per year, he said, and could lull people into a false sense of security.
