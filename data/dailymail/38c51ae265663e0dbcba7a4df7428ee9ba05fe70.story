They may have been divorced since 1996, but Prince Andrew is clearly still on very good terms with his ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson.

The prince today accompanied the Duchess of York - along with their two daughters, Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie - to the wedding of her stepmother, Susan Ferguson, 66.

Mrs Ferguson married former soldier Sir Richard Swinburn, 74, in a ceremony for 120 guests at the 900-year-old All Saints Church, Dummer, near Basingstoke, Hampshire.

The couple chose to marry by the old 1928 service - meaning the new Mrs Swinburn did not include 'obeying' in her vows - which was conducted by the Rev Christopher Walker, a retired Chaplain to the armed forces, and it is thought that the bride's son gave her away.

The Duchess of York - whose father Major Ronald Ferguson died nine years ago - wore a knee-length purple dress with a mauve shawl and a deep purple velvet coat. She topped her elegant ensemble with a delicate feathered fascinator.

Her daughters - legendary for the adventurous headgear they chose to sport to the wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton in 2010 - opted to go bare-headed.

Eugenie chose to wear black beneath a long dark-cream overcoat with brass buttons, while Beatrice decided on a dark grey overcoat above a pale flowery dress and stiletto boots.

After the service a peal of bells played as the newlyweds walked arm-in-arm down a path to the car.

Mrs Swinburn, who looked happy and relaxed with her new husband beneath their umbrella, wore a grey outfit and knee-length coat, and carried a bunch of flowers. Sir Richard tipped his top hat as they reached the car.

They were then taken to Susan's nearby home for the reception, just ahead of a Range Rover carrying the duchess, Prince Andrew and their two children.

Afterwards the reverend said Sir Richard was 'a very lucky man to meet someone like Susan', adding that 'the bridegroom was absolutely thrilled' and that the service went 'fine'.

Mr Walker - who has known Sir Richard for 50 years - went on: 'I was in the same regiment as the bridegroom for 20 years, and I had been chaplain for 25 years.

'She used the old 1928 Service which does involve obeying. I was very honoured and privileged to be asked to conduct the service.'

Mr Walker said he met Susan after they got engaged.

A local who defied the torrential weather to see the couple come out said: 'It is lovely for her to be married again.'
