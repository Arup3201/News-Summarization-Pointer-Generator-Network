Row: Celebrated chef Rick Stein is at the centre of a row after two Scottish restaurants claimed they produced the best fish and chips he had ever tasted

When top TV chef Rick Stein told Lilian MacDonald her fish and chips were the best he’d ever tasted, she couldn’t wait to tell the world.

She put up signs at the Oban Fish and Chip Shop, as well as an advertising board on the pavement outside her business in the bustling Argyll port, quoting the comment by her No1 fan.

But now a war of words has broken out after the neighbouring Nories establishment, on a shiny new advertising board, attributed similar words of praise about their fish and chips to a surname-less ‘Rick’.

Nories, just along from Mrs MacDonald’s shop in George Street, is run by the Di Ciacca family, who have served fish and chips to the people of Oban for three generations.

The board outside Nories quotes ‘Rick’ saying: ‘Best fish and chips I’ve ever had’ – while the one at the Oban Fish and Chip Shop quotes Rick Stein saying: ‘The best fish and chips I’ve ever tasted.’

Mrs MacDonald, who has been running the Oban Fish and Chip Shop for eight years, said the sign went up outside her shop to try and encourage business.

She said: ‘Rick Stein said our fish and chips were the best he had ever tasted. We were in his programme Food Heroes and he was seen coming out of our shop with fish and chips.

The sign: This is the one that is linked to the Oban Fish and Chip Shop but a rival has apparently tried to claim the same

‘We thought we would promote it, so we put signs up a couple of years ago and people are always commenting on it.

‘The reason I put the signs up was because I didn’t want people getting confused with the other place, it was just a bit of marketing.

‘But then one of my staff came in with a photo of their new sign. I think it is misleading the public, saying “Rick”. It might not say Rick Stein, but it says Rick and it is blatantly obvious they are trying to confuse people.

‘I feel that they are trying to undermine me in my business. There is plenty in the town for everyone, but they want the biggest piece of the pie.

‘How would they like it if I put a sign outside saying: “Three generations of fish-frying excellence?”’

Renato Di Ciacca said Nories did not wish to comment.

It is the second time that TV chef Stein has been at the centre of a local culinary storm. In 2000, he left a bad taste in the mouths of staff at a sea life museum as he filmed for the new television series.

Staff at the Scottish SEA LIFE Sanctuary in Oban claimed Stein borrowed five of their lovingly nurtured colony of rare horse mussels, known as ‘clabby doos’, but only returned four of them.

And they believe the TV chef ate one raw after a fisherman showed him the best way to eat it.

Museum curator Mark Steward said: ‘We’d had our horse mussels for seven years and we hadn’t nurtured them for so long just to provide a tasty treat for Rick Stein.’

But Stein’s production staff laughed off the claims. Programme producer David Pritchard said: ‘I can assure you that if Rick had eaten a raw mussel after it had been in a tank for seven years then he might not be with us now.

‘I don’t think they would have been very edible. He did open one up so that we could see what it looked like inside, but I have to say it wasn’t very appetising and he certainly didn’t eat it.

‘Rick may have thought about eating one on camera – but he would not have dreamed of  actually doing so.’

Nevertheless, Stein has helped to make the traditional fish and chip supper a staple across the country.

Experts have credited him with helping to boost tourism both locally and nationally. His second fish and chip shop opened in Cornwall almost three years ago. The Falmouth town centre shop has a sister outlet in Padstow.

Richard Voase, a specialist in the sociology of tourism, said the shops would generate wealth for the region through increasing visitors.

Mr Voase, from the University of Lincoln, said: ‘Restaurants are normally secondary attractions – you think about where you are going to eat once you have arrived.

‘But a celebrity chef turns a restaurant into a primary tourist attraction because it becomes part of the reason to visit.

‘Tourist attractions like these generate wealth for the region by increasing the volume of incoming visitors and, more controversially, for second-home ownership.’

Figures show around £1 out of every £100 consumers spend on food is handed over to the local chip shop.

According to recent surveys, the Welsh are most likely to prefer to fry their chips in the traditional fashion, rather than opt for the oven-cooked varieties.

During World War II, fish and chips – once described by Churchill as ‘the good companions’ – escaped rationing.

Rick Stein’s new programme, Rick Stein’s India: The Search For The Perfect Curry, started on BBC2 this week.
