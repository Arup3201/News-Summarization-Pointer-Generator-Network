A former squad mate of a Marine implicated in the deaths of 19 Iraqis testified today that after a roadside bombing, the group raced to nearby homes, firing and tossing grenades for 45 minutes even though the Marines did not take gunfire, cross a single insurgent or find a weapon.

Still, former Cpl. Steven Tatum told the jury at the Camp Pendleton trial of Staff Sgt Frank Wuterich that he felt the squad did nothing wrong that day in Haditha in 2005.

Marines killed 24 Iraqis, including unarmed women and children.

Wuterich, who led the squad that day, faces nine counts of manslaughter.

He is the last defendant in one of the biggest criminal cases against U.S. troops from the war.

The squad was returning from a supply run at a combat outpost in the early morning when one of the four humvees in their convoy hit a roadside bomb, killing Lance Cpl Miguel Terrazas and wounding two others.

Tatum said he rushed to help someone trapped under the humvee when he heard small arms fire hit the vehicle in front of him. Wuterich and another Marine ran toward the nearest home.

Tatum testified that when he caught up to Wuterich, the sergeant told him to 'treat the house as hostile'.

Charged: Wuterich is the last defendant in one of the biggest criminal cases against U.S. troops from the Iraq war. He faces nine counts of manslaughter.

Tatum said he understood that to mean there were armed individuals inside and he did not need to identify his target to attack.

The Marines tossed grenades in rooms and fired off rounds.

One man was killed near the kitchen.

Others were killed in a back room, where Tatum fired alongside Wuterich but said he was unable to see what he was shooting at because of the darkness and flying debris after a grenade exploded.

The Marines left when someone yelled that they had seen a person running out of the home.

They ran to a neighboring house, tossing grenades in rooms and shooting off rounds.

Tatum saw the body of an Iraqi man near the kitchen when he went in after his fellow Marines.

While checking an empty room, Tatum said he heard people in a nearby room moving then Wuterich firing his M-16.

He rushed to help him, shooting at what he said were silhouettes in the dark, some big, some small.

'The only thing that gave me any indication there was a hostile act in there would be Staff Sgt. Wuterich firing sir,' Tatum told military prosecutor Maj Nicholas Gannon.

He returned later when the house had been determined to be safe and learned they had killed an unarmed woman and children in the room.

The defense says Wuterich believed insurgents were in the homes and that's why he ordered his Marines to shoot first and ask questions later.

Wuterich of Meriden, Connecticut, is the last defendant in one of the biggest criminal cases against U.S. troops from the war.

Prosecutors have implicated him in 19 of 24 Iraqi deaths.

Yesterday, Maj Gannon charged that Wuterich made a series of fatal assumptions and lost control of himself during the massacre.

He made the accusations to a jury of battle-hardened Marines hearing the case against Staff Sgt. Frank Wuterich, more than six years after the squad committed the killings in the town of Haditha.

'The evidence will show that none of the victims were a threat,' Gannon told jurors in his opening statement.

Prosecutors told the military jury of four officers and four enlisted Marines that Wuterich shot indiscriminately without taking time to identify his targets after a roadside bomb exploded and killed a Marine.

The deadly attack known as the Haditha massacre occurred on November 19, 2005, led to the deaths of 24 Iraqis in total.

Seven of them were children.

The killings are considered among the Iraq war's defining moments, further tainting the U.S.â€™s reputation when it was already at a low point after the release of photos of prisoner abuse by U.S. soldiers at Abu Ghraib prison.

Sgt Frank Wuterich is the last of the eight Marines initially accused of murder or failure to investigate the killings to face trial.

Six others had their charges either dropped or dismissed, and one was acquitted.

A full investigation didn't begin until a Time magazine reporter inquired about the deaths in January 2006, two months after the incident.

The story behind the killings was retold in Nick Broomfield's 2007 film Battle for Haditha.

The prosecution has implicated Wuterich in the deaths of 19 of the 24 Iraqis killed that day, the Associated Press reports.

Wuterich and another Marine fatally shot five men in a car near the site where the bomb went off, prosecutors said.

Wuterich then ordered his squad to clear a nearby home with gunfire and grenades, telling them to shoot first and ask questions later, according to the prosecution.

After killing men, women and children inside the first home, the Marines went to a second home, where Wuterich stood at the foot of a bed in a back bedroom, spraying a woman and children with bullets, Gannon said.

The killings in Haditha on November 19, 2005, are considered among the war's defining moments, further tainting America's reputation when it was already at a low point after the release of photos of prisoner abuse by U.S. soldiers at Abu Ghraib prison.

The massacre is believed to have been set off by the death of Lance Cpl Miguel Terrazas who was driving a humvee that was destroyed by an IED. Two other soldiers in that humvee survived.

Wuterich is accused of ordering a driver and four Iraqi teens out of a taxi nearby and gunning down each of them in the street.

Both the defence and prosecutors agree that Terrazas' death influenced Wuterich's decisions later that day.

In his opening statement, Wuterich's 
attorney Haytham Faraj told jurors that Navy investigators, under 
pressure to show the Marine Corps was not covering up the massacre, 
brutally interrogated the other Marines in the squad for up to 14 hours 
and offered to drop charges against them if they testified against their
squad leader.

'You have a bunch of scared Marines promised immunity who are going to tell you about things that did not happen,' Faraj said.

Faraj, a retired Marine, asked jurors to apply their knowledge of the Marine Corps and combat experience when judging the case.

He said Wuterich's battalion had been
told by commanders that intelligence indicated the city was becoming a 
hotbed of insurgents.

After the bomb exploded, the squad 
came under small arms fire when Wuterich ordered the homes to be 
cleared, believing there were insurgents hiding there, Faraj said.

'We
don't believe there was a crime committed here,' Faraj said. 'It was 
the unfortunate result of an attempt to do the right thing, but it 
turned out to be tragic.'

Wuterich is charged with nine counts of voluntary manslaughter.

He has said he regretted the loss of civilian lives but believed he was operating within military combat rules.

He is the last of the eight Marines initially accused of murder or failure to investigate the killings to face trial.

Six had charges dropped or dismissed, and one was acquitted.

Gannon said evidence will show Wuterich 'never lost control of his squad ... but he made a series of fatal assumptions and he lost control of himself.'

Gannon also showed excerpts from an interview of Wuterich by '60 Minutes' in which he said he believed none of the Marines with him went against his orders.

A full investigation didn't begin until a Time magazine reporter inquired about the deaths in January 2006, two months after the incident.

Retired Army Col. Gregory Watt, who led the initial probe, testified that Wuterich told him that he had instructed his squad to go into the homes firing, recalling 'I told them to shoot first, ask questions later.'

'I clearly remember that,' Watt testified. 'Sgt Wuterich at the time was very straightforward, very professional and very forthcoming.'

Watt added: 'He said that on more than one occasion as we talked through the events that transpired.'

Army Lt Col David Mendelson, who assisted Watt in the investigation, told jurors he was surprised to hear that Wuterich had instructed his squad in that way and had acknowledged that he didn't positively identify his targets, a basic combat rule when deciding to use deadly fire.

'It seemed to show a lack of discipline and that essentially there were no rules... and that concerned me,' Mendelson testified.

Legal experts say military prosecutors face an uphill battle trying to prove, so many years later, that Wuterich's actions were criminal.

Wrangling over unaired outtakes of the 60 Minutes interview delayed the case from going to trial for years before prosecutors won the right to view the footage.

Some believe the jury of combat Marines - many of whom cleared homes in Iraq like the operation Wuterich ordered - will be better equipped for the case over a civilian one in which people may not feel comfortable judging what is considered to be an appropriate reaction in the chaos of war.

'Military jurors may say, look tens of thousands of us went to war zones and didn't kill civilians, but they may also be willing to consider the fact that the individual may have been caught in the fog of war,' said former Navy officer David Glazier, a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles.
