So long, era of the floaty, fluffy, waffle dressing-gowned girly spa weekend! These days it's all about the holistic sex retreat, don't you know.

Aimed at women who have lost touch with their sensuality, misplaced their mojo or are generally having a bit of a tough time locating their innermost confidence, these female-only residential getaways involve working with a range of trained therapists - including sexologists - to feel better about all aspects of your life, including your sex life.

And Shh... - a luxury, no-boys-allowed haven held in a secret Dorset location - is Britain's first such sensuality retreat, launched by long-time friends Vikki van Someren and Lucy Arrowsmith, both 39, who created their own retreat after both being left somewhat 'dismantled' by experiences with The Hoffman Process of psychoanalysis.

Shh..., an all-female sensuality retreat held in a secret Dorset location, is, according to founders, about 'celebrating and connecting with our femininity to live to our full potential'

Described in the Sunday Times by Stephanie Theobold, who experienced the retreat, as 'Babington House meets Anais Nin meets rebranded new age', Shh...  is described by van Someren herself as 'a fresher, more sophisticated way of thinking about sensuality'.

By taking part in a range of therapies including sensual healing, transformational breathing, reiki, massage, somatic experiencing, acupuncture, EFT, NLP and relationship 
and sex counseling, guests are taught how to build 
confidence, release anxiety, overcome trauma and explore their unique 
sensual potential.

The retreats - which cater for eight women at a time with eight therapists creating a completely bespoke experience for each - are based on three principles:

Sensuality: Unlocking our sensuality by connecting with and nurturing all of our 
senses through a guided physical and emotional journey.

Healing: Using therapeutic bodywork based therapy to help connect with our own innate healing capacity.

Harmony: Celebrating and connecting with our femininity to live to our full potential.

Using a range of therapies guests are taught how to build confidence, release anxiety, overcome trauma and explore their unique sensual potential

Speaking about their project, Arrowsmith and van Someren say: 'We want to shift the taboo 
around women's sensuality and sexual awareness.

'Shhâ€¦ retreats offer women
 the chance to experience, appreciate and celebrate their femininity 
through developing an understanding of the relationship between 
sensuality and self-confidence, creativity and the affects this has on 
living a full and rich life.

'We combined our experience, passion, skills
 and beliefs and have set ourselves a mission to organise unique 
experiences in the form of retreats and events to harness the collective
 power of women, and drive a new paradigm in the perception of 
sensuality and the language associated with it.'

The team call Shh... - which stands for 'sensual, healing harmony' - 'the 2014 destination for women looking to improve 
their sensuality and for those seeking a fuller, healthier and sexier 
life', explaining that the retreat offers 'unique, private, intensive retreats for women, hosted
 by a team of female expert practitioners and guides'.

'Shh is the 2014 destination for women looking to improve their sensuality and for those seeking a fuller, healthier and sexier life'

Arrowsmith - a former international swimmer, personal trainer and Sky Sport's TV presenter - and Vikki van Someren - a media director with 17 years in the publishing industry - joined forces on their current project having been inspired by each other's personal story.

Founded in 1967, The Hoffman Process is a residential course designed to unlock negative energies and leave you better equipped to deal with life's difficulties.

Created by health professionals, therapists, educational advisors, spiritual healers and others from the human potential movement, it is based on a variety of established teachings, from psychodynamic to cognitive.

Retreats includes counselling workshops and various types of therapy to help people overcome stress and depression.

Arrowsmith was one of the UK's leading fitness experts until she was diagnosed with ME in 2011. 

Then, combining her knowledge of sports science with her experience of traditional therapies, she developed a personal 
programme to manage the side affects of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, which had sensual healing at its core.

Van Someren herself turned to sensual healing as a way of overcoming childhood sexual abuse and a motorbike 
accident in 2011 which damaged her pelvic organ nerve endings.

She noticed profound improvements in her health and well-being, and quickly
 set out to research how sensual healing experienced with other 
therapies can improve health.

The two women decided to launch their own retreats, the next of which will take place in March 2014, based on the proven principle that 
'bodywork and alternative therapies can have a profound affect on 
removing the emotional scars of trauma'.

They say: 'Trauma can come in many forms; 
depressions, abandonment, infidelity, childhood bulling, 
sexual/physical/emotional and mental abuse, bereavement and many more.

'The body acts as a host for emotional and physical wounds; these 
scars play a significant part on our inability to remove emotional and 
physical blockages.

'On Shh... retreats we work closely with the body to 
identify and release the trauma that often-unknowingly affects us daily;
 be it in our self-confidence, our relationships, our work and or 
self-perception.'

These female-only residential getaways involve working with a range of trained therapists - including sexologists - to feel better about all aspects of your life, including your sex life

'It's not just about sex, by any means,' retreat spokesman Aimee told MailOnline. 'It's a really cutting edge combination of therapies used to heighten your senses and sexuality.

'It's about learning to live with all your 
senses and come to terms with them and heighten them. It's very unique.

'We 
work with each woman to see what they want and need. All therapists 
work together so you get a very bespoke retreat, and although you work as a group 
all treatments are unique to you.

'There's also a three-month aftercare 
program supporting you on your journey back to real life.

'I think there will eventually be couples retreats further down the line, but right now it's designed by solely women for women.'
