Engaged: The honourable Nicholas Knatchbull, with fiancee Raz Tedros by his side. The pair plan to marry in August

There is little about this casually dressed couple to suggest that you’re in the presence of aristocracy.

But the shaven-headed man in the hooded top is the honourable Nicholas Knatchbull, godson of Prince Charles and heir to the £100million Mountbatten fortune.

And the woman by his side is nurse Raz Tedros – who, as his new fiancee, is set to become the 9th Baroness Brabourne when he one day inherits the family title.

Eton-educated Nicholas, who currently has the courtesy title of Lord Romsey, is a former drug addict who once risked being disinherited because of his battles with crack cocaine and heroin.

Now, after almost two years free from drugs, the 32-year-old is steadily rebuilding his relationship with father Lord Brabourne, grandson of Lord Mountbatten.

He has proposed to Miss Tedros, whose family originate in Eritrea, and is planning a ‘simple’ wedding in August. The couple became engaged shortly before Christmas and have moved into a plush flat in a gated building in a fashionable part of East London.

Miss Tedros, 28, who works at a private hospital in Chelsea, is said to be a steadying influence on Nicholas who is attempting to start a career as a digital artist.

Her family are so impressed by Nicholas – who was a mentor to Prince William at Eton – that he became a godfather to her niece at Easter.

One friend said: ‘Nick is absolutely lovely and everyone is very happy for them both, they want to do things quickly and are planning a wedding in August.

‘I don’t think it will be a big affair as Raz likes to keep things very simple. When Nick told us about his background none of us believed it because it doesn’t really matter. He is already an important part of Raz’s family.’

The couple have been dating for almost a year and were photographed together at last year’s Notting Hill Carnival.

Miss Tedros, whose real name is Rahel, also appears arm in arm with 6ft Nicholas in photographs on his Facebook page.

Another friend said: ‘Raz makes Nick very happy and keeps him on the straight and narrow. 

Worlds away: His family's 60-room stately home at Broadlands, in Hampshire

‘They met on the clubbing scene and were friends before going out together, and their relationship has developed from there. Now he seems to have left his wild days behind him and is more interested in producing his digital art work with the support of Raz.

‘Everyone is thrilled for them. She doesn’t care what background he is from and he is the same about her.’

This is Nicholas’s first serious relationship since the end of his engagement to Anglo-Jamaican single mother Zeaphena Badley.

After the break-up Miss Badley, 31, said: ‘I’m not someone you could think could become a lady. I’m not like Kate Middleton.’

Miss Badley, who was brought up on a south London council estate, knew nothing of her lover’s privileged background when they first shared a rented room in a London house. 

She realised the scale of his family wealth only when she visited the 60-room stately home on their vast country estate at Broadlands in Hampshire. In the darkest days of his addiction Nicholas, who was a techno DJ under the name ‘Safe as Milk’, was at serious risk of being disinherited from the family fortune as his parents were worried about leaving the 5,000-acre ancestral estate in his care.

But in the last two years he has been steadily rebuilding his relationship with his father.

The Knatchbull family was  devastated in 1979 when Lord Mountbatten was assassinated  by an IRA bomb planted on  his yacht during a holiday in the Irish Republic.

Lord Brabourne’s beloved younger brother Nicholas, 14, was among the dead. Lord Brabourne named his eldest son after him.
