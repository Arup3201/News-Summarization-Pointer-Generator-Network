Shocking: Collin Brewer is facing fresh calls to permanently step down from Cornwall Council

A 68-year-old councillor who said disabled children should be ‘put down’ sparked further controversy today by comparing them to deformed lambs who need to be culled.

Cornwall Council veteran member Collin Brewer said children with disabilities should only be allowed to live after the cost has been evaluated - much like farmers who kill the runt of the litter.

Independent Mr Brewer stood down earlier this year after he claimed disabled children could be put to death to save taxpayers’ money.

He later apologised and quit the council - but then won back his seat in this month's local elections earlier this month.

But he now faces fresh calls to permanently step down after making more outrageous comments, saying ‘there may be a case’ for treating disabled children like deformed livestock.

He told the Disability News Service that runt lambs are often put down by farmers who deal with them by ‘smashing them against a wall’.

He said: ‘If they [farmers] have a misshapen lamb, they get rid of it. They get rid of it. Bang.’

Mr Brewer said he discussed his previous statements about putting disabled children down with a farmer from his Wadebridge East constituency. He claimed the farmer made it clear he ‘didn’t see a lot wrong with what I said, because it is something they do every day’.

He added: ‘We are just animals. He obviously has got a point - you can’t have lambs running around with five legs and two heads. It would be put down, smashed against the wall and be dealt with.’

When asked if he believed there was not much difference between putting down a lamb and a child with two heads, he said: ‘I think the cost has got to be evaluated.

'It is not something I would like to do but there is only so much in the bucket. If you are talking about giving services to the community or services to the individual, the balance has got to be struck.’

Asked if he believed it might be kinder to kill a child with two heads, he said: ‘Is that one child or two?

‘I would hope that, although I don’t like the idea of it, long before it is born that this problem is [dealt with] and it will probably be aborted in some way.’

And when questioned if a child with a similar impairment should be killed after birth, he said: ‘That would be up to the decision of whoever is there at the birth.’

Asked whether there was a good argument 
for killing some disabled children with high support needs to save 
money, he said: ‘Yes. That is why I keep as far away from health in the 
council as I can.

'There may be a case. I haven’t a clue how much they cost.’

Mr
 Brewer first caused outrage in February after telling a member of 
Disability Cornwall that disabled children should be put down because 
they cost the authority too much.

He
 later apologised and resigned but decided to stand again and won 
re-election to the ward of Wadebridge East by just four votes in the 
elections on May 2.

The UK's leading disability charity 
called on Cllr Brewer to resign - describing his comments as ‘insulting,
 demeaning and disgusting’.

A Mencap spokesman said: ‘We have been contacted by a number of people who share our disgust and who are asking us to take action.

‘In an attempt to give him the opportunity to apologise, or correct these comments, Mencap has tried, on a number of occasions, to contact Mr Brewer. We have had no success as we have been told has been on sick leave and his email doesn't work.

‘We have asked him what he means by these insulting, demeaning and disgusting comments, and whether he intends to meet local groups representing disabled people to reassure them.

‘Mencap is reluctant to give him further publicity but we now join the thousands of people who have contributed to an online petition calling for his resignation as soon as possible.’

Hayley Goleniowska, 43, whose six-year-old daughter Natty has Down's Syndrome, has been campaigning against Cllr Brewer’s comments and said he has ‘brought shame on our community’ with his ‘extreme views’.

She told MailOnline: ‘After Cllr Brewer's initial comments and resignation, many of us hoped he would make amends and prove the sentiments behind his apology by working with disability groups.

‘Sadly Cllr Brewer did not take the time to do this. The county was stunned when he stood again for election a few weeks later, making his apologies worthless, his arrogance all too apparent.

‘Many families were deeply angered and hurt. Cllr Brewer is bringing shame on our community, but it must be recognised that he is in a very tiny minority with his extreme views.

‘I have been invited to Number 10 to meet (Prime Minister’s wife) Samantha Cameron next week for the work I do in this field. I might just mention the thorn in Cornwall's side while I am there.’

A spokesman for Disability Cornwall said:
 ‘It’s particularly frightening these views may be held by those who 
have the positions and power to make life and death decisions.

‘It’s a sad indictment of our so-called civilised society that disabled children are increasingly discussed within the context of affordability, as if they are goods on a shelf that can be picked up and discarded at will.’

Joe Taylor, project coordinator at 
the Wave Project in Truro, which works with disadvantaged and disabled 
youngsters said Cllr Brewer's comments could put disabled people off 
visiting Cornwall.

Mr Taylor said: ‘We are dependent on 
tourism and an elected councillor is saying disabled people are not 
welcome here. What kind of message does this send to people?

‘The disabled tourism industry in 
Cornwall is worth around £1.5 million and the council is trying to 
encourage more disabled people to come here. It is really damaging on so
 many levels.’

Brewer is currently on sick leave from his duties as a councillor, because of medication he is taking for a long-term health condition.

His poor health meant he was not at County Hall in Truro while a demonstration of about 70 people against his re-election was taking place outside the building.
