Two professional cyclists have been disqualified from the prestigious Vuelta a Espana after they traded blows from their bikes 
during an uphill climb.

Russian
 Ivan Rovny and Italian Gianluca Brambilla were thrown out of the Tour of Spain after they appeared to take aim at each other during Monday's 16th stage.

The pair had been involved in an early
 breakaway during the pivotal 160.5km stage 16 from San Martin del Rey 
Aurelio to La Farrapona.

Trouble
 brewing: Tensions that had been building right through the 16th stage 
came to a head when Ivan Rovny (third right in yellow) tries to put his 
arm round Omega Pharma Quick-Step rider Gianluca Brambilla

Lashing out: The two riders then started to exchange blows as other riders in the leading pack watched on

Fist fight: Rovny and Brambilla exchange blows at close quarters as the leading group roll on at speed

Still
 going: The pair continued to trade blows for the best part of a minute 
as they negotiated an uphill section with about 40km of the stage left

Face off: Rovny and Brambilla continue to exchange glares and words as the race continues

As the leading group approached the 
climb towards San Lorenzo, about 40km from the finish,  Tinkoff Saxo
 rider Rovny appeared to try and put his arm around Brambilla.

The
 Omega Pharma Quick-Step rider then appears to swing his arm back in 
retaliation, sparking a fist-fight as other competitors looked on in 
amazement.

Race officials disqualified both from the race just a few minutes later.

Brambilla's
 Omega Pharma Quick-Step team confirmed on their Twitter feed that their
 man had been thrown out of the race and added that Rovny had also been 
expelled.

Brambilla
 reacted with exasperation as officials broke the news to him from a 
safety car, raising his arms up in the air. Rovny dropped back out of 
the main pack when told the news.

Alberto Contador won the stage ahead of Briton Chris Froome, extending his overall lead.
