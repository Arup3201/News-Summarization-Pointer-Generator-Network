The Ivy League-educated girlfriend of a New York banana tycoon was so badly battered and abused by her married boyfriend that she once wrote on the back of a photograph 'if you find me dead, Thomas Hoey did it,' prosecutors have alleged.

Despite her chilling words and what prosecutors say was years of abuse so brutal that she lost hearing in one ear and had her teeth chipped, Alison Bretherick is standing by her man - and fighting the Manhattan District Attorney's attempt to send Hoey away for beating her.

Hoey, 46, is already facing up to 11 years in prison after he admitted that he refused to call 911 when another mistress, personal trainer Kimberley Calo, overdosed on cocaine that he had given her following a three-way sex romp at a luxury Manhattan hotel in 2009. Miss Bretherick was not with Hoey the night Calo died.

The New York Post reports that Miss Bretherick, 29, is refusing to cooperate with authorities as they pursue charges that he savagely beat her and left her with a bloody scalp in 2012. She has even even showed up in court to support her alleged abuser. 

If convicted, Hoey could have four more years tacked on to his prison term. 

In court filings, prosecutors detail how Miss Bretherick was a promising University of Pennsylvania graduate who had just gotten into an executive training program at Macy's when she met Hoey in 2008, according to the Post.

Hoey, the millionaire owner of the Long Island Banana Corp., had seen Miss Bretherick on the street on the Upper West Side and had one of his bodyguards stop her and tell her his boss wanted to meet her. 

On their first date, he picked her up in a limo and 'accidentally' spilled soup on her dress -- then showed her two new outfits he had already picked out for her.

As the relationship progressed, however, Miss Bretherick was the victim of regular, brutal abuse at Hoey's hands, prosecutors alleged.

According to the Post, police say he beat her for not picking up the phone fast enough and once bashed her head through a wall. 

The abuse chipped her teeth and left her with no hearing in her left ear, according to authorities.

Miss Bretherick has publicly refused to turn on Hoey, but in 2010 she admitted to her cousin that she was terrified of him, authorities say. 

She wrote 'If you find me dead, Thomas Hoey did it' on the back of a photograph of her grandfather and showed it to her cousin, according to court documents. 

However, when a judge granted a protective order barring Hoey from seeing her in May, Miss Bretherick protested, telling the judge: 'I savor my trips to see Tom in jail; they are the highlight to my week.'
