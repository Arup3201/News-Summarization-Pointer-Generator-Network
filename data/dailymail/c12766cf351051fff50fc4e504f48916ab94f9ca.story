Premier League chief Richard Scudamore remains the front-runner to become executive chairman of English football’s elite division in the ultimate inside promotion.

As many as 10 Premier League teams were said to be backing such a move before the last club summit in November, but the subject was not raised during discussions.

However, the selection panel, led by Chelsea chairman Bruce Buck, are struggling to find suitable outside candidates to replace City financier Anthony Fry, who is too ill to continue in the post — leaving Scudamore as still the strongest option.

A final decision is not expected until the new year but the 20 top-flight clubs would be expected to endorse Scudamore as chairman if that is the recommendation.

It would represent a remarkable turnaround for the 55-year-old, who was fighting for his job last summer after a puerile sexist-text exchange with Premier League lawyer Nick West was made public.

Jonathan Gregory, the former England 2018 bid commercial chief who was one of the few to emerge from that doomed World Cup campaign with his reputation enhanced, has landed a major job in Russia, of all places. Gregory has been appointed World Cup director of adidas for Russia 2018 with the brief of maximising the brand in the host country. Russia’s national team have adidas as kit suppliers, and the firm are also top-tier FIFA sponsors.

 Brian Cookson, the British president of world cycling’s UCI, is eyeing a place on the IOC. 

But Cookson must show he is worthy of such a role by sorting out cycling’s chronic drugs problem — starting with a firm lead on whether the Astana team of Tour de France winner Vincenzo Nibali should be given a 2015 race licence after five doping offences.

 The pantomime at Leeds continues with club directors Jinesh and Saleem Patel, representatives of GFH, served High Court writs by a private detective as they arrived at Elland Road for a board meeting. 

The £1m damages claims are for deceit and conspiracy to injure former GFH colleague and ex-Leeds CEO David Haigh by luring him to Dubai. Haigh has been imprisoned there for more than 200 days without criminal charge.

 BEEB'S DOCU-DRAMA

Brian Cookson is eyeing a place on the IOC

BBC insiders are agitated about falling behind rivals ITV, as well as subscription channels BT and Sky, in the making of sports documentaries. This has been sparked by the upcoming BBC Sport programme on the FA Cup, which is seen as trite and celebrity-obsessed.

The two-hour documentary, commissioned by BBC3 for a New Year’s Eve slot, will be presented by Rio Ferdinand and singer Olly Murs, with Cup memories supplied by a varied cast including Russell Brand, Eliza Doolittle and boy band One Direction.

It compares unfavourably with BT Sport’s film for Boxing Day about Wimbledon’s Crazy Gang, which will not be much edited despite the storm of protest from Plough Lane old boys — following a private screening — about how they are portrayed.

Beeb sources, who acknowledge, too, the work done for ITV’s acclaimed Keane and Vieira documentary, are also unimpressed that husband and wife Jo McCusker and Peter Small are involved in the FA Cup production.

A Beeb spokeswoman said: ‘Jo and Peter are full-time employees of BBC Sport, so it is inevitable there will be projects they work on together. The Cup documentary is intended to attract a younger audience, which is a key aim.’

There is upset at Sky about Surrey chief executive Richard Gould claiming English cricket’s T20 competition desperately needs terrestrial coverage to grow the format. Sky have monopoly domestic 20-overs-a-side rights until 2017, with the option to extend until 2019.

Historic reforms agreed by the IOC open up the possibility that two cities in different countries could host future Olympics. Boston is considered the strongest choice for 2024 but a new bullet train-line, shortening the journey between Singapore and Kuala Lumpur to one hour, could make a shared Games between those cities feasible by 2028.
