Tottenham have made an enquiry for Croatia international striker Andrej Kramaric.

The 23-year-old plays for HNK Rijeka and has been valued at £10million after a startling season which has seen him score 27 goals in 19 games for club and country so far.

AC Milan and Inter are both keen on Kramaric but believed he could be prised out for £4million as part of a get-out clause.

However, the deadline for that clause has passed and any suitors will have to spend double that to sign him.

Tottenham have been looking for strikers with Southampton’s Jay Rodriguez and Saido Berahino of West Brom among those admired while Mauricio Pochettino also saw Sandro Ramirez score for Barcelona B last weekend.

Kramaric, though, is tipped to follow in the footsteps of former Croatia striker Davor Suker with his scoring exploits and has attracted attention from Napoli and Monaco as well.
