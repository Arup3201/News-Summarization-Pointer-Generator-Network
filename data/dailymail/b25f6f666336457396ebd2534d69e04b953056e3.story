Oscar: British director Mark Gill has been nominated for an Academy Award for his short film The Voorman Problem

He who dares, wins.

Director Mark Gill knew it was a long shot when he asked Hollywood A-lister Kevin Spacey to star in his debut film.

His cheeky request to the star of American Beauty to be in his film has certainly paid off though.

The star of America Beauty may have declined to act in The Voorman Problem - but he helped Mr Gill bag Rev star Tom Hollander, who in turn brought along Sherlock's Martin Freeman.

And the brass neck of the 32-year-old graduate has certainly paid off after he bagged a career-making Oscar nomination for the film, which was shot on location at Strangeways Prison and the University of Salford.

The accomplished blagger is now 
looking to push his luck even further with a bid for free flights to Los
 Angeles for the ceremony.

He was reported to say: 'At the minute we have no flights booked because we're skint, we poured all our money into the film.

'We've spoken to British Airways and we've tweeted Richard Branson, but we'll probably have to put it on a credit card.

'We'll be slumming it in the back, in steerage.'

The director chose to write to Mr 
Spacey after studing for a film degree from the University of Central 
Lancashire, where he had won an RTS Student Award with his graduation 
film.

After admiring the American's 
performance in Seven, he decided to try his luck and sent a letter to Mr
 Spacey asking him if he would like to star in his debut film.

After admiring the American's performance in Seven, he decided to try his luck and sent a letter to Mr Spacey asking him if he would like to star in his debut film.

Mr Spacey, the artistic director at the Old Vic in London, politely declined the offer but recommended Tom Hollander for the role.

Mr Gill said: 'All good actors love to read a good script and we had so much belief in the project.

'We always look to work with the best and it worked here.'

After bagging the Rev actor, Mr Freeman - currently starring as Bilbo Baggins in Hollywood blockbuster The Hobbit - soon followed.

Mr Gill told The Times: 'He wasn't Bilbo Baggins when we called him.

'He'd just got Sherlock.

'We were just grateful to get Martin.

'He's in aÂ  lot of short films and he's a great champion of the form.'

The Voorman problem was co-written by Mr Gill along with producer Baldwin Li and was adapted from a section of the novel number9dream by David Mitchell.

It won the Best Live Action Short at the St Louis International Film Festival and Best Screenplay at the Corona Fastnet Film Festival. It has also just been nominated for a BAFTA AWARD in the short film category.

Mr Gill's next project is another short film called Full Time starring Chris Langham.

He is also developing his first feature film.
