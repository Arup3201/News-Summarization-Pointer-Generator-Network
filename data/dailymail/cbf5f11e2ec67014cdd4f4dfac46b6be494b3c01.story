Eleventh-hour: Ronald Phillips, 40, was due to be put to death on Thursday but was issued a stay of execution so he could give his liver to his mother

A death row inmate has had his  execution rescheduled so he can donate a kidney to his mother.

Less than a day before child killer Ronald Phillips was set to die by lethal injection, the governor of Ohio called it off.

Phillips, 40, who raped and killed a three-year-old girl, also wants to give his heart to his sister.

‘I realise this is a bit of uncharted territory for Ohio, but if another life can be saved by his willingness to donate his organs and tissues then we should allow for that to happen,’  governor John Kasich said.

His sister, who has serious heart problems, might not be able to use the heart because it may be poisoned by the lethal chemicals.

The execution will now take place on July 2, 2014.

Critics have questioned whether the condemned can freely give consent, or are desperately hoping to win clemency.

They worry such practices could make judges and juries more likely to hand out death sentences.

And they are troubled by the notion of using inmates for spare parts.

Medical ethicist Arthur Caplan of New York University said organ donation is incompatible with the goals of punishment.

'It's unethical because this guy who's being executed raped and killed a 3-year-old. When you donate your organs, there's a kind of redemption,' Caplan said.

Postponed: Child killer Phillips will now be executed on a gurney similar to this next July

'Punishment and organ donation don't go well together. I don't think the kinds of people we're executing we want to make in any way heroic.'

Yet it's not unheard of for a death row inmate to become an organ donor. Condemned Delaware inmate Steven Shelton was allowed to donate a kidney to his mother in 1995, though his execution wasn't imminent.

Controversial: Governor of Ohio John Kasich said the decision was 'uncharted territory'

In 1996, the Alabama Supreme Court halted David Larry Nelson's execution so he could donate a kidney to his sick brother. His brother was too ill for surgery and later died.

Requests in other states, including Texas, have been rejected. All involved so-called live donations, never donation of a vital organ like a heart.

Richard Dieter, executive director of the Washington-based Death Penalty Information Center, which opposes capital punishment, said the practice raises troubling concerns.

'Once you put the person into the death row or execution category, then their life becomes less in the equation of things,' he said.

'That's a slippery slope of one life being used to save another.'

Anne Paschke, a spokeswoman for the United Network for Organ Sharing, said in a statement that her organization's ethics committee in 2007 deemed the practice 'morally reprehensible.'

She said the committee sees extreme difficulty 'in ensuring that a condemned prisoner could give proper informed consent for donation, free from any coercion or consideration of personal gain.'

Caplan said keeping vital organs viable during executions would require avoiding lethal injection, electrocution and other methods that would harm them.

Utah murderer Gary Gilmore, executed by firing squad in 1977, agreed to donate his eyes, kidneys, liver and pituitary gland for medical use. His kidneys proved unusable because of bullet wounds.

'The only way I can think of to get organs out of prisoners is to shoot them in the head or guillotine them,' Caplan said.

'Are we really going to have witnessed executions of that type? I don't think so.'

Dr. Brooks Edwards, the director of the Mayo Clinic Transplant Center and a transplant cardiologist, said it would be possible to use some organs after an execution, including the liver and kidney, but not the heart.

Even so, he said he is opposed to the idea, saying it could lead a judge or jury to believe that handing down a death sentence could help save another's life.

Precedent: In 1996, David Larry Nelson's (left) execution was halted so he could donate a kidney to his sick brother and Gary Gilmore, agreed to donate body parts for science before his execution in 1966

'One would worry that the enticement of organ donation could somehow be perceived, even subconsciously, as some kind of perverse incentive. I think that's wrong,' Edwards said.

'There are certainly accusations of prisoners being executed in other countries for organ donation, and we have to be well above that.'

States such as California, Utah, Arizona, Oklahoma and Texas have nonetheless considered policies promoting organ donation among inmates. Some proposals would shorten sentences in exchange for organ or bone marrow donations.

Some transplant recipients think such donations could be a good thing.

'I don't know who my donor is and I really don't care," said John Afek, a 57-year-old accountant and financial adviser who underwent a heart transplant nearly two years ago.

'It gave me my life back, and I'm a single dad with a couple kids who suddenly got their father back.'
