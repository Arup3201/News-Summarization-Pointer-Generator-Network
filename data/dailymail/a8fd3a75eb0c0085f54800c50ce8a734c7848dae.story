An alleged flasher has come up with a novel defence – his manhood is too small for anyone to notice it.

The 54-year-old man identified only as Herbert O was accused of showing a teenage girl rather more than the package he was delivering in August 2013.

That night the girl and her mother went to the police to file a complaint against man, from Leer, Lower Saxony, Germany.

However, Herbert has claimed that he is too under-endowed to have flashed the girl and has even asked his wife to stand up in court and testify to his lack of inches.

Leer town centre: Herbert O is on trial here accused of flashing a teenage girl but claims his penis is too small for him to have committed the crime and his wife stood up in court and testified on his behalf

'I'm sorry, darling, but your penis is too short to hang out of your trousers,' she told the local court in the town of Leer in East Frisia.

Defence lawyer Lutz Winkler then requested the judge Ulrike Andrees to measure the organ herself to verify the claims.

Judge Andrees has asked the coroners' office in Oldenburg to measure Mr O’s organ.

'If the wife has spoken out so frankly about this, I have to follow it up,' she said.

Herr Winkler is determined to see his client cleared and has refused to settle for a fine in exchange for settling the case.

They may yet have months to wait to see if the expert medical opinion stands up in court.

'We've never seen anything like this before,' said court manager Norbert Bruns.
