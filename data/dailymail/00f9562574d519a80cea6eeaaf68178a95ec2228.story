A quarter of Britons have not changed their bed sheets for at least six months, a new study claims.

Just 17 per cent of people were found to change their bedding every week, while 28 per cent admit they only wash their sheets once a month.

Even more concerning was the discovery that 24 per cent of Britons have not changed their sheets for more than six months.

The survey also revealed that 32 per cent of people have not cleaned their bathroom properly for at least six months.

Only 29 per cent say they vacuum or sweep their house every week.

The research also revealed that women are even worse at housekeeping than men are – 19 per cent of men claim to change their bedding every week, compared to only 15 per cent of women.

However, women were found to be better about cleaning the bathroom – 41 per cent of women claim to clean their bathroom every week, compared to just 36 per cent of men.

While the research, conducted by sales website HushHush.com,  suggested that Britons are not very good at cleaning their own homes, it did reveal that we want to live in clean houses – 62 per cent said that they would employ a cleaner if they could afford to.

Dr Adam Fox, a paediatric allergist at a leading London teaching hospital, warned that dirty sheets could exacerbate a number of health problems.

He told MailOnline:  'Having good bedroom hygiene when it comes to changing your sheets is about more far than just freshening up your linen.

'We spend about a third of our lives asleep and this is reflected in the debris that we leave between the sheets. 

'Our bodies shed millions of skin cells each day, many of which rub off in our sleep and are deposited in our beds.

The survey, which would horrify How Clean is Your House? stars Kim Woodburn and Aggie MacKenzie, also revealed that 32 per cent of people have not cleaned their bathroom for six months

'In addition to skin cells, our bodies also secrete fluids, sweat and oils during a long night’s sleep.

'While unsavoury in themselves, these deposits mostly pose a problem as they are all deliciously appealing for dust mites.'

He added that while dust mites in themselves are quite harmless, the droppings of the microscopic creatures are laden with allergens which can cause health complications. When inhaled, these allergens can provoke asthma and rhinitis and may also worsen eczema.

'In order to reduce the possible problems caused by dust mites, the professional recommendation is that people with dust mite allergies should be taking a number of measures to reduce allergen exposure.

'Those who suffer particularly badly should consider investing in dust mite proof bedding and we should all be making it a priority to wash our sheets once or twice a week at 60 degrees.

'It may seem like a bit of a chore but taking these precautions helps to protect against the health complications which may be caused or worsened by the unwanted dust mites which share our sheets.'
