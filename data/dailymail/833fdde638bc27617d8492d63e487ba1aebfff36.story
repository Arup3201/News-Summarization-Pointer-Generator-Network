Spectators were left somewhat astounded on Friday when a giant marionette stopped mid-parade to urinate on the street.

Little Girl Giant, one of many 'giants' created and operated by French street theatre company Royal de Luxe, squatted and lifted up her skirt in Perth's CBD before relieving herself in front of hundreds of thousands of spectators.

The six-metre-high marionette spent the day walking the city streets as part of a three day special ANZAC-themed production to commemorate the centenary.

Thousands of people packed Langley Park overlooking the Swan River to watch the spectacle begin on Friday.

The marionette awakened from her slumber, took a shower and then changed into a green dress and yellow raincoat before being craned onto a boat that 'sailed' down Terrace Rd.

The massive throng followed her stroll along Riverside Drive to the Bell Tower, where she got into her car and took off down Barrack St.

Thousands more spectators lined her well publicised route in anticipation of her arrival.

City dwellers gathered on their balconies to watch, construction workers downed tools and pin-striped executives wrangled access to rooftops to take in the spectacle.

Meanwhile, outside the Wellington St train station, her 11-metre-high companion slumbered in a diver suit.

He'll play a big role on the weekend, but for now, all eyes are on his smaller co-star.

As the legend goes, she was the last person to wave them goodbye

The massive marionettes require a team of 70 people to move the machinery that suspends them, while more than 300 volunteers will help them navigate the city streets.
