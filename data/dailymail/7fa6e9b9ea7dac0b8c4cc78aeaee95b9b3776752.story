‘Welcome to the World Cup in Brazil’. Phew! Nicely done, Mr Chiles.

I suppose if you were going to get it wrong, then the dress rehearsal in Miami was the best place. Yes indeed, ITV had made their way from Florida to bring us the opening salvos of Brazil 2014.

And right away, they set quite the challenge for their BBC counterparts. The opening title sequence was an absolute beauty (‘our director’s been working on it most of his life’, said Adrian), with its cool samba version of the evergreen standard ‘Brazil’ and famous World Cup scenes recreated by Brazilians on the street and on the beach.

Alright on the night: Adrian Chiles made a fine job of his opening credits in Brazil

Special guest: World Cup winning Italian Fabio Cannavaro joined ITV as a studio pundit

All-star cast: Lee Dixon, Cannavaro and Patrick Vieira offered expert opinion on the World Cup opener for ITV

On the beach: Ian Wright was given an even more luxurious location to report from

Speaking 
of sun-kissed sands, it certainly looks like Ian Wright has found his 
spiritual home on the Copacabana. He was having just way too much fun on
 there with his mate, the cameraman ‘Nozza’, as Wrighty called him.

It
 was the old Arsenal front man’s job to set the scene, which he managed 
to do whilst also name dropping ‘my dear friend Barry Manilow’ and 
accosting a surprised young German surfer called Stefan. Who thirty 
seconds later was Wrighty’s new dear friend ‘Stef’.

This
 sense of joie de vivre also made it into the opening ceremony In Sao 
Paolo - finally. Once the giant salad buffet made way for the dancers and
 the drummers, there was at last a sense of occasion rising up from the 
stadium.

Tragically
 though, that atmosphere didn’t make its way to our tellies when the big
 finale came. That was a five minute horror show.

Local
 star Claudia and top drawer import J-Lo teamed up for the World Cup 
song ‘We Are One’. But the sound was virtually non existent for the 
audience at home. And the close ups were ruined by what sound there was 
being out of sync with the pictures.

As
 the stars left the field, a barely whelmed Clive Tyldesley informed us 
‘there’ll be a closing ceremony in 31 days from now’. Which at that 
precise moment, seemed much too close for comfort!

Star of the show: Jeniffer Lopez was hired to add some extra glamour to the opening ceremony

Off key: J-Lo's performance was hampered by poor sound quality and syncing problems

Best of friends: Matt Smith and Carlos Alberto got on very well as they reported from the stadium

Back
 in the ITV studio, and Adrian was equally as crestfallen as Tyldesley 
had seemed. But that was because Matt Smith had the plum job of 
interviewing Carlos Alberto in the stadium. And got a big hug from the 
former Brazil captain in the process.

‘Wow,
 a pat on the back from Carlos Alberto’, said Chiles. Then looking to 
his right at the indefatigable Patrick Viera, told him ‘I’ve been 
waiting two years for one of them from you’.

Patrick smiled broadly, but didn’t twitch. ‘No?’, sighed Adrian. ‘OK’.

Mind
 you, worse was to come. ITV’s other special opening night guest was 
Fabio Cannavaro. And he spoke wistfully of Italia 90 and how he had been
 there as a ball boy to see his hero score - ‘Lineker’! No justice is 
there, Adrian.

Someone
 clearly happy to be there is Joey Barton. Eurosport are screening a 
series of live preview and review shows on site. Joey was sat on a 
veranda above the Copacabana.

There
 was a cooling breeze gently ruffing his quiff. And the presenter 
opposite him, Ashley House, was in a suit and Brazil T shirt. Be honest,
 Joey, Bit more like it than Question Time, eh?

But
 life isn’t all a beach. There was the small matter of a tournament to 
get under way. Which happened straight after a symbolic gesture of peace
 in Sao Paolo. ‘Nothing like a FIFA congress for bright ideas’ tut 
tutted Tyldesley.

Then, as we saw the three birds of peace rise into the air he muttered just under his breath ‘the doves from above’.

Vic
 and Bob will have approved, Clive. Indeed, they may have been 
scrabbling around in their front rooms for a notepad when, in the second
 half, he was chatting about the new World Cup ball.

“The one they used in the last tournament was roundly criticised’, he told us. Keep that one in the act, Clive.

Colourful: Locals showed up in their numbers to cheer Brazil on to victory against Croatia

Excitement: There was plenty of carnival atmosphere among the home crowd

Not
 everything was a laughing matter, though, we were to discover. Because 
at the end of the game and on the return to the studio, a shot of the 
beach that we had last seen empty as everyone left to to watch the game,
 was now busy with a protest.

‘FIFA
 GO HOME’ read one of the banners as Chiles explained people had been 
gathering for about ten minutes when they ‘heard sharp, clattering 
sounds’. At which point the studio camera picked out cracks in the 
window from stones thrown from the below.

Thankfully
 no one in the studio was hurt. Indeed, our plucky host was clearly 
determined not to let the incident ruin the mood. Because for no 
apparent reason at all, he wrapped coverage of the first game of the 
World Cup in Brazil with a clip of elephants playing football in 
Thailand.

‘You
 will see a hell of a defensive wall there’, he chuckled. You might want
 to have a word with Clive about some material, Adrian?
