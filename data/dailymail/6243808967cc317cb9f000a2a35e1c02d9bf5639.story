Andrew McGarry deliberately slammed the Vauxhall Zafira into the front of the terraced home early one morning in July

A road safety campaigner deliberately drove his car into the home of his estranged wife - setting the house on fire while she and their three children were inside, a court heard.

Andrew McGarry deliberately slammed the Vauxhall Zafira into the front of the terraced home early one morning in July. The car exploded and set the house on fire but nobody was hurt.

Architect McGarry,37, of Harwood, Bolton, Greater Manchester, admitted causing arson with intent to endanger life and property at Bolton Crown Court.

McGarry launched a campaign calling 
for drivers to stick to the 30mph speed limit after his then 
two-year-old daughter Lacey was knocked down and injured outside the 
family home in 2010.

He was remanded in custody until he is sentenced on January 18.

He will also be sentenced then for breaching a non-molestation order, which he admitted at an earlier hearing. No action will be taken against two charges of arson recklessly endangering life.

McGarry was the only person in his Vauxhall Zafira when the crash happened.

He drove his car into the house in Horwich, while his wife, Heather, and their three children were inside, at 7.05am on Tuesday, July 24.

Witnesses reported hearing a bang and then seeing the car engulfed in flames.

At the time a neighbour, who asked not
to be named, said: 'I was woken up first thing when the fire brigade 
got there and all I could see was smoke billowing everywhere.

He drove his car into the house while his wife, Heather, and their three children were inside. No-one was hurt

McGarry was said to be 'suffering some sort of breakdown'

'It was a big fire, there were flames everywhere.'

Large sections of nearby streets were closed while firefighters put out the burning vehicle 
and police launched an investigation.

Another nearby resident, who did not want to be named, said: 'I heard the crash and ran out of 
the house. The car was already well alight and the fire brigade had been
called. I didn't see anyone in the car or in the area.'

'There were a few small explosions. A
man stopped his van just after the crash and went over with a fire 
extinguisher, but the flames were too big.

'There was nothing that could been done and there was no-one in the car when it was on fire, from what could be seen.'

Another neighbour said: 'It was horrendous. I was asleep and I just heard a huge bang when the car hit the wall.'

Architect McGarry, who previously had run a road safety campaign, admitted causing arson with intent to endanger life and property at Bolton Crown Court

McGarry's traffic campaign was backed
by councillors and a Driver Feedback Sign was installed, telling 
drivers what speed they are doing.

Wayne Jackson, defending, said: 'The case is fairly straightforward because of what happened and the comments he made to various witnesses.'

'The psychological report states there are difficulties resulting from the breakdown of the relationship and difficulty letting go. He is depressed. It's clear that he had some form of breakdown.'

Judge Timothy Clayson remanded McGarry, an architect, in custody until he is sentenced in January.
