The frustrations of certain Scotland coaches appeared to boil over after their late defeat to Italy on Saturday afternoon.

A picture from the Telegraph shows how a reinforced glass door in the Scotland coaches' booth at Murrayfield was smashed during the late 19-22 defeat to Italy.

It is not known whether it was head coach Vern Cotter who smashed the door, which can only be accessed by coaching staff or the media, or one of his assistants.

A team spokesman failed to deny that a member of the coaching team had caused the damage after Scotland had given them numerous reasons to get angry.

Cotter concedes his 'message' is not getting through to his players after watching them crash to their third RBS 6 Nations defeat on the spin.

The Dark Blues' faces were left matching their crimson red change strip as they threw away victory against Italy with a late collapse - leaving them near certainties to take home the Wooden Spoon.

Having struggled to deal with the Azzurri's driving mauls and referee George Clancy's pedantic meddling at the scrum, the Scots found themselves a man light as debutant lock Ben Toolis was sin-binned two minutes from time.

And the visitors to Murrayfield clinched a 22-19 victory when Clancy's patience finally ran out as he awarded a penalty try after Scotland resorted to another infringement just inches from their own goal-line in a desperate bid to halt Italy's last-gasp surge.

It was the 14th foul committed by Cotter's men and came after penalty-littered defeats to France and Wales.

The Kiwi had warned Scotland to be on their best behaviour but after falling to the Italians for the seventh time in 15 years, he said: 'I'm obviously not getting the message across.

'That's one of those things that has been spoken about and it needs to be taken on board.

'I still think there is a lot of growth in this side. Things have gone forward.

'We just need to address a couple of simple things which will help us change and control outcomes better.'

But Cotter also admitted he will have to take his share of the blame.

Asked if he regretted replacing skipper Greig Laidlaw with five minutes to go just as the Italians were turning the screw, he said: 'Not just that. I'm responsible for the defeat so I will be having a good look at myself and how we can move forward.'
