Almost 200 secondary schools face being taken over or shut down after failing to meet basic GCSE performance targets.

League tables published today reveal how 195 comprehensives have fallen short of Government ‘floor’ standards, and will be closely monitored until they improve.

Nearly twice as many schools are below floor targets as last year, after the thresholds were raised to put heads and teachers under greater pressure to improve.

But the Government says 56 schools which were on course to miss the targets managed to rise above them following interventions such as giving heads greater independence from councils.

Struggling: 195 schools are at risk after failing to reach Government GCSE standards (picture posed by models)

Today’s tables give a school-by-school breakdown of results in GCSEs and A-levels taken by hundreds of thousands of teenagers this summer.

They will show that only 16 per cent of pupils across the country achieved the new school leaving certificate, the English Baccalaureate, which comprises C grades or better in the core subjects of English, maths, science, humanities and languages.

This marked a slight increase on last year.

Schools are considered to have fallen below floor targets if they fail to help 40 per cent of pupils to C grades or better in five GCSEs including English and maths, and if pupils’ progress in the two core subjects is too slow.

Last year’s floor standard was 35 per cent, alongside the progress measure.

Schools beneath the threshold are vulnerable to being taken over by new leadership teams or turned into academies under the control of outside sponsors. Some could even face closure.

Some 65 of the schools missing the standard have already been pulled out of local authority control and handed over to sponsors in a drive to raise results.

It emerged last week that the Government has ordered 100 academies to submit detailed scorecards direct to Whitehall every six weeks in a bid to

This year’s GCSE results were dogged by controversy over English grades amid claims that last-minute changes to grade boundaries deliberately suppressed pupil results.

One council, Suffolk, issued a press release claiming the changes ‘have had a detrimental effect on key stage four results across Suffolk schools, with even high-performing schools seeing the effect on their normally excellent results.

However the Government says national results show no evidence of a so-called GSCE English ‘effect’.

A spokesman for the Department for Education said: ‘These figures are further evidence of the great success of the academy programme in turning around our weakest schools – sponsored academies are improving their GCSE results five times faster than other schools.

‘They reveal the amazing power of academy sponsors to turn around under-performing schools – often schools which have been persistently sub-standard.

‘This shows we are right to continue to support the sponsored academy programme. These brilliant sponsors have a track record of arresting decline – and then reversing it.’
