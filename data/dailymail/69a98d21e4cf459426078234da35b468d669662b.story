A college student from South Dakota lost her family on Saturday after her mother, father, sister and brother were all tragically killed in a car crash.

The South Dakota Highway Patrol said 52-year-old James Vollmer, his wife 48-year-old Julie Vollmer and their two children 16-year-old Alyssa and 13-year-old Caleb were all killed when their Ford Explorer swerved off Interstate 90 and fell into an embankment.

The oldest child in the family, Brittney Vollmer, who attends Northwestern College in Iowa, was not involved in the crash.

The South Dakota Highway Patrol said James Vollmer lost control of the vehicle near mile marker 394 on Saturday night

James Vollmer, who was driving the SUV, died at the scene, along with his two children who were in the back seat.

Julie Vollmer, the front-seat passenger, was taken to a nearby hospital by helicopter, where she died soon after.

The South Dakota Highway Patrol said James Vollmer lost control of the vehicle near mile marker 394 on Saturday night.

At that point the red SUV crashed into the median, hit a guardrail and slid down into the embankment where it was launched from one side to the other, splitting the vehicle in two.

The driver and three passengers were all wearing seat belts, police said.

On Sunday, students and parents who knew the Vollmer family gathered at Sioux Falls Christian Schools where the children attended, to pray for the four who were killed and the one who is still living.

Neighbors cried at the memory of the Vollmer family

‘Both Caleb and Alyssa had smiles as big as Texas,’ Jay Woudstra, superintendent of Sioux Falls Christian Schools where Alyssa was a sophomore and Caleb was a 7th grader, told KDLT News.

‘They were a wonderful group of people to be around, and they were just a joy to have at our school,’ he said.

Woudstra said they are four faces he will never forget.

‘Mom and Dad were the salt of the earth, hard-working people,’ he said, adding that they were always there to support their two children in their many school-related activities.

A distraught neighbor told Sioux Falls South Dakota News that the Vollmers were the first people they met when they moved in.

‘It was the Fourth of July, and we were first moving in and they were having a party,’ said Chris Klein, as his wife Tammy sobbed over the news.

‘They literally swept us away from the moving truck and invited us over. Nicest neighbors I’ve ever met,’ Klein said.

The South Dakota Highway Patrol is investigating the exact cause the crash.

Brittney Vollmer has not spoken to the media.
