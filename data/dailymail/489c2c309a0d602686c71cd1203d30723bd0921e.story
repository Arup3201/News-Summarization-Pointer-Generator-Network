Jenny Roderick has posted thousands of fliers about her missing granddaughter in northern Kentucky cities.

A pretty 17-year old girl, Paige Johnson disappeared last September and police have no leads in the case.

Now, officials in Covington Kentucky, are they're telling the girl's grandmother to remove her posters from city property.

While putting up them up in Covington last week, Ms Roderick was stopped by police and told that putting fliers on city utility poles was illegal.

Missing: Jenny Roderick has posted fliers seeking her granddaughter all over northern Kentucky

Ms Roderick told WKRC Cincinnati: 'He wasn't mean or anything, he was just insistent that I had to take them down. And by the time I was walking back after he left, I was crying.'

Bearing the summer heat, Ms Roderick spends most of her spare time posting the missing girl's flyer around the region.

Refusing to give up hope, she said: 'We still want people to know that that she's not found. And that, you know, there's tons of people that love her.'

Paige Johnson is also the mother of a two-year-old daughter named Kenzie.

Her grandmother added that: 'It has affected our whole family. We miss her something fierce. And we want her home, you know, even if it is the other way.Â 

'We still want her home and this is what keeps me going.'

A spokesperson for the Covington Police said that the officer confronted Ms Roderick because the city received a complaint.

He suggested she put them up in legal spots, like store windows and bulletin boards.

But Ms Roderick chose utility poles because of their high visibility, and she said that: 'Some businesses will let us put them up in the windows, but not very many.

While insisting that the city has 'no intention of being insensitive to her family,' the city manager said that regardless of what the posters say, they have to come down because they break city ordinances.

Police department spokesman Spike Jones said officers had begun removing signs but would leave them up in some areas to 'try to balance compassion with the law.'

Paige Johnson was last seen on September 23 by her friend, 23-year-old Jacob Bumpus.

Mr Bumpus told police he dropped her off at a friend's house at 1am, but she never made it there and hasn't been heard from since.

He came under investigation and hired an attorney. Police say he has cooperated with them and is no longer considered a suspect.

Nevertheless, Mr Bumpus is currently locked up on a parole violation.

Paige's friends meanwhile have spread the word digitally about her disappearance on facebook and other social media sites.

They've also organized benefits to support the girl's family, and regularly post images of her online to remind people that she's still missing.

Under a facebook photo of Paige and her daughter Kenzie, one friend wrote: 'How cute are they.. Don't forget to pray for Paige's lil girl.. We hope you come back soon.'
