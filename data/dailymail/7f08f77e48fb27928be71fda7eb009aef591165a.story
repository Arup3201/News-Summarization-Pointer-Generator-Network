Rationing, the Second World War and crackly black-and-white TV, if you were lucky.

Surely no-one today would like living in the 1940s?

But Ben Sansum would because he is fascinated by the decade. Indeed, he has spent years transforming his home into the house that time forgot.

The 35-year-old, from Godmanchester, Cambridgeshire, has been obsessed with all things Forties since he was a teenager.

Ben, from Cambridgeshire, developed his obsession with all things 1940s in his childhood

Sleep easy: Even in Ben's cosy bedroom, he's made sure every detail is perfect

Cooking aids: Tins, a bread bin and a 1940s kettle in the kitchen

Ben's vintage living room complete with armchairs, a 1940s carpet and period fireplace

He has a bakelite phone, Vera Lynn record on his grammophone, and a kitchen full of old tins.

In the lounge, he has a 1930s three-piece suite, and his set of flying ducks came from a nearby house. 

But that's just the start. Mr Sansum, who works for British Airways, doesn't just make his house look 1940s, he lives it too. 

He gets up at 4am to fire up his range cooker, uses an outside loo and a carpet sweeper and does the laundry with a mangle.

Mr Sansum also attends 1940s events with his close friend and fellow war-time enthusiast, Jonathan Jefferies.  

He says his Ewbank carpet sweeper works really well, even though it is 80 years old. He also listens to his Dame Vera Lynn records on the gramophone.

But Mr Sansum does have to make some compromises.

He can use his old-style telephone only to receive calls because some numbers on the dial are broken. When he wants to ring out, he has to plug in a modern set.

And he confesses to other modern comforts. He has a flat-screen TV hidden behind a vintage magazine rack and keeps the mangle in front of the washing machine.

Ben Sansum completely gutted his modern home to go back in time almost 70 years to live in a post war era with his dog, George

Mr Sansom said: 'I only recently got into the internet and I find it a bit of a nightmare. People now have their heads stuck in their phones'

The original outside loo is in an outhouse in the garden, but sadly, there is no 1940s car on the gravel drive there. 

Mr Sansom told the Sunday People: 'I only recently got into the internet and I find it a bit of a nightmare. People now have their heads stuck in their phones.

'I think that's why I enjoy the era so much, people used to talk rather than worry about what was happening on things like Twitter and Facebook.'

He added: 'It's such a huge part of who I am it's become quite normal. I feel protective of the generation and I don't want it to slip away.'
