Facing trial: Shrien Dewani arrives at Belmarsh Magistrates' Court to hear he can be extradited to South Africa to stand trial for his wife's murder

Shrien Dewani, the British man accused of murdering his wife on their honeymoon in South Africa, is likely to stand trial after a judge gave the go-ahead for his extradition.

The millionaire Bristol businessman, 31, is accused of organising a car-jacking and shooting which left wife Anni, 28, dead in a Cape Town taxi last November.

Dewani denies any involvement in the killing and had fought extradition proceedings, arguing that he is suffering from severe post-traumatic stress disorder and is too unwell to be extradited.

His lawyers had claimed he was mentally ill and that extradition to face trial would be a violation of his human rights.

But District Judge Howard Riddle ruled he can be sent to stand trial in South Africa although the final decision will rest with Home Secretary Theresa May.

He said: 'The court must consider the strong public interest in honouring our extradition treaty'.

Judge Riddle added he had 'no doubt' that Dewani is suffering from severe post-traumatic stress disorder and depression and is at high risk of suicide or self-harm.

But he said he was satisfied he would receive the appropriate levels of mental health care at the hands of the South African authorities.

He took more than two hours to read 
out his judgment at Belmarsh Magistrates' Court in south east London, 
beginning with evidence relating to the serious problems with 
overcrowding, violence and sexual violence in South African jails.

He
 said Dewani, whom he described as 'good-looking, youthful and 
physically well-preserved', would be particularly vulnerable to sexual 
abuse.

He said: 'There has been some suggestion that he may be gay.'

But although many South African prisons are ill-equipped to deal with the mentally ill and inmates are at high risk of contracting HIV or Aids, the judge said he was satisfied that Dewani would be held in one with a good level of facilities and be kept in a single cell.

Wearing a dark blue sweatshirt and black 
trousers, bearded Dewani sat in the dock and stared straight ahead at 
the judge throughout the hearing.

Members of his family were also in court.

On February 20, Dewani, who has been staying at Fromeside Clinic, a secure mental health hospital in Bristol, was admitted to Bristol Royal Infirmary after taking an overdose, and was heard to have said 'I don't want to live'.

The judge said he accepted psychiatric evidence that Dewani remains at high risk of suicide but added: 'I'm satisfied that authorities are alert to the possibility and will take appropriate steps to prevent that risk.'

He added that Dewani is 'highly intelligent, an advantage not shared by many criminals in courts' and had shown awareness of developments in the country.

'He added: 'I have complete confidence in the South African system of justice.'

The extradition proceedings began in May but were adjourned while a psychiatric report was completed.

Shrien and Anni Dewani were ambushed by 
car-jackers as they drove through a dangerous South African township. 
initially it appeared to be a random attack.

The newlyweds were being chauffeured through the dangerous township of Gugulethu when their taxi was hijacked on November 13.

Dewani was ejected while his wife was
 driven off and shot dead. Her body was found the next morning in the 
back of the abandoned cab.

Taxi driver Zola Tongo, who has 
admitted his part in the crime, claimed in a plea agreement with 
prosecutors that Dewani ordered the car-jacking and paid for a hit on 
his wife.

Dewani denies any wrongdoing and his lawyers had argued he may not be safe if held in a South African prison.

But police investigating Mrs Dewani's
 murder soon developed a different theory centring on her husband, who 
had escaped unharmed.
