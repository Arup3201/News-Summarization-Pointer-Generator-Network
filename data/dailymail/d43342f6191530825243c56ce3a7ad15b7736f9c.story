Mersane Warria, also known as Raina Thaiday, who has been charged for murder after the deaths of eight children on Friday

Five fathers have been told their children were among those brutally murdered at the Murray Street house in Cairns on Friday morning, say Police.

The bodies of four girls aged 14, 12, 11, and two and four boys aged nine, eight, six and five, were found by their 20-year-old brother when he returned to the house on Friday.

Detective Inspector Bruno Asnicar says police have spoken to all five of the children's fathers.

'I don't think anybody would imagine any reaction other than absolute devastation, to be told that their child's dead. Of course that was the case,' he told reporters on Saturday afternoon.

He said the families have been co-operating with police, which had helped make the identification of the children easier.

'Even under these horrific circumstances and the trauma they've been through, the support that the family has been giving us in this investigation has been outstanding,' he said.

'And it's been because of them this process was able to be done in a really calm, easy and least intrusive way we possibly could.'

A 37-year-old woman, Mersane Warria, who is also known as Raina Thaiday, has been been charged with eight counts of murder, and appeared before a magistrate in a bedside hearing at the Cairns Base Hospital on Sunday morning. She is the mother and aunt of the children who were reportedly stabbed to death.

One grieving father said she should have been celebrating his daughter's 14th birthday today. 

'I've lost a beautiful daughter,' said the elderly man, who asked not to be named for cultural reasons.

'What for? What has she done?'

He says tears streamed down his face when he and his wife were told their girl was one of eight children found murdered at a house on Murray Street in the Cairns suburb of Manoora on Friday morning.

Warria, who is the mother of the other seven children, was arrested and under police guard in hospital where she was  treated for stab wounds. The bodies the children were found by her 20-year-old son on Friday.

The father said on Saturday his daughter had been staying with the woman, the girl's aunt, in the Murray St house for about a week.

'(The son) told us that everyone is dead,' he said.

'I said how come you are telling me this,' he said.

'And I was crying and (my wife) was crying, everybody was crying.'  

He last saw his daughter the night before she died at a local McDonald's restaurant where she was eating dinner with friends.

'I said come with me but she said: "Oh no dad, I'm going with my friends, my aunty",' he told AAP.

The man said he and his wife are now searching for answers.

'What happened?' he said.

'Do you know what happened? Me and my wife we want to know.'

He was shocked by news the aunty may be responsible.

The man said his daughter had spent many weekends and holidays at the house and there had never been problems. 

He said Warria had recently decided to turn her life around and was again attending church.

He said his daughter loved her friends, school and reading.

'When I dropped her at the house a week ago, everyone was happy,' he said.

'The last time I saw her she kissed me. She said she loved me and she asked for $100 which I said I'd give to her on Saturday morning on her birthday.

'My daughter, she was beautiful.'
