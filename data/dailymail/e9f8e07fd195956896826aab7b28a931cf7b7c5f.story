Alexis Wright, the Zumba prostitute from Maine, had sex with more than 100 men for money because she believed she was working as an undercover agent for the State of Maine investigating 'sexual deviancy' in the sleepy town of Kennebunk - or at least that's what she's telling her husband.

Wright, who is serving a 10-month sentence after pleading guilty to reduced charges, is refusing to testify at the trial of one of her alleged johns, invoking her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.

Wright appeared in court today and gave her married name, Alexis Sandra Trowbridge. It appears her husband, Jason Trowbridge, believes her story and is taking her back.

Pleading the Fifth: Alexis Wright, serving 10 months in jail, took the stand today and refused to testify against one of her alleged clients

Wright is claiming that her business partner Mark Strong, a private investigator, told her that he had hired her as an undercover agent

Wright's husband Jason says he believes his wife's story and is standing by her. Prosecutors say she had sex with more than 100 men for money - sometimes five in a day

Wright, 30, now maintains she was a pawn all along. It has emerged that Wright claims that Mark Strong, her business partner who was found guilty of promoting prostitution, told her that he was on special assignment for the state of Maine and that he had hired her as his undercover agent.

Wright claims that Strong, a licensed private investigator, told her that the brothel she operated out of her Zumba studio was really an elaborate sting operation backed by the state of Maine.

The goal, Wright claims she was told, was to catch sexual deviants in Kennebunk.

Strong's attorney said Wright's claims are laughable.

'That this woman, who had allegedly taken on 100 or so men to have sex with for money, was investigating for sexual deviancy, is the pot calling the kettle black,' lawyer Daniel G. Lilley told MailOnline.

The attorney for Strong, who was convicted of promoting prostitution and sentenced to 20 days in jail, said Wright's claims are laughable

Wright is refusing to testify against her alleged johns and has declined an immunity agreement, as well

Lilley said it doesn't appear prosecutors bought her claim. There was no evidence presented at Strong's trial that he had said he was working for the government.

Wright's husband Jason Trowbridge, however, does seem to believe her. He stood by his wife in an interview with a TLC documentary called 'Sex, Lies and Zumba.'

'It sounds crazy. It just made more sense that's what was going on,' Mr Trowbridge told the documentary. 'Put the pieces together. That fits the story.

'People think it's a joke and people might always think it's a joke. I'll stand by her story because that's what I saw.'

Wright first made reference to her bizarre claim when she spoke up at her sentencing hearing.

She claims that the meticulous records she kept and the fact that Strong had to be watching via webcab during each of her trysts are proof that she thought she was having sex with the men as part of an official government investigation.

Wright was called to the stand to testify against Donald Hill, a former high school hockey coach who was one of 68 men arrested and charged with being clients of Wright, according to the Portland Press Herald.

Hill, who was forced to quit his job after he was named publicly, maintains that Wright led him to believe he was having a romantic relationship with her.
