Wikileaks founder Julian Assange is to be given a platform to deliver his thoughts to Radio 4’s Today programme.

The controversial activist will speak to the programme tomorrow from his London embassy bolthole, where he has taken  refuge for more than a year.

Assange was chosen by award-winning singer PJ Harvey, who is guest editing the daily news show and has sought assurance from the BBC that no contributions will be edited.

Other guests she has lined up in order
 to create a ‘diverse group with thought-provoking views’ include former
 Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams and campaigning journalist John
 Pilger.

Broadcast from 6am,
 the show will also feature poetry readings by actor Ralph Fiennes and 
music by Tom Waits, Joan Baez and New Zealand comedy duo Flight Of The 
Conchords.

Harvey’s programme will include a Thought for The Day from Dr Williams, in the form of a poem.

Assange
 was given asylum by Ecuador and entered the country’s London embassy in
 August 2012 while he faced extradition to Sweden to face rape 
allegations.

He was recently played by Benedict Cumberbatch in the Wikileaks movie The Fifth Estate, which bombed at the box office.

Harvey
 – who was awarded an MBE in the summer – is one of a number of guest 
editors commissioned by the Today show over the festive period every 
year.

Others so far this year have included Michael Palin and Baroness Manningham-Buller, the former director-general of MI5.
