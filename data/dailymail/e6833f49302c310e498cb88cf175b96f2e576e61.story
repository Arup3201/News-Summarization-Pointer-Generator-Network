Stevan Jovetic carried out the ALS Ice bucket challenge in dramatic fashion as he wore only his boxer shorts and a pair of flip flops.

Jovetic received an icy reception  at Manchester City's Carrington training centre as two members of staff soaked the Montenegrin international.

The Manchester City forward had a positive pre-season and will be hoping he can play a part in City's bid to retain their Premier League crown.

The 24 year-old won't be short for competition for places and Manuel Pellegrini is adamant that Manchester City have the strongest squad in the Premier League. 

Pellegrini said: 'I think we always have to be better, we have to improve every season. It doesn't matter what happens with the other squads.

'Here in the Premier League you always have four or five strong teams that can win the title and if we want to continue winning titles, of course, we must improve.

'But I always say my players are the best players in the Premier League and we have the strongest squad, not only attackers but also defending, and in the whole squad.

'Other teams also have strong squads but if you are analysing the players I prefer mine.' 

Sergio Aguero, who made a late cameo appearance at St James' Park, getting himself on the scoresheet in the process is one of a number of players still not rated as match-fit after his an extended summer break when the World Cup finished.
