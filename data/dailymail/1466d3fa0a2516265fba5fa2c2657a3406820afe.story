It could be a really cool way to lose weight.

Research suggests that winter weather may help keep us thin.

In what will be welcome news for those who ate a few too many mince pies, it seems that something as simple as standing outside without a coat on could help rolls of fat melt away.

The troublesome white variety that we are all too familiar with soaks up extra calories and stores them in big bellies, love handles and saddlebag thighs.

But adults also have a small amount of a second ‘healthy fat’. 

This brown fat specialises in burning off calories and generates heat as it does so.

Babies have the lots of brown fat to keep them warm and adults that have more brown fat are slimmer than those without. 

A spokesman for the Californian researchers said: ‘Those who over-indulged during the holidays may want to get a shot of cold air to kick-start some extra fat-burning activity for the new year.’

The theory isn’t to do with low temperatures speeding up metabolism, instead it hinges on the different properties of two types of body fat.

The University of California, Berkley researchers, showed protein called Zfp516 to be key in turning ‘bad’ white fat into a fat that resembles the healthy brown stuff.

With around 90 per cent of the fat in an adult’s body of the unhealthy white variety, finding a way of browning it could have a big impact.

Importantly, cold temperatures ramp up production of the browning protein.

And the more Zfp516 there, is the more white fat is converted into calorie-burning brown fat.

In one experiment, mice that were genetically engineered to make large amounts of Zfp516 put on 30 per cent less weight than other creatures – despite feasting on fatty food.

It is thought that while babies still need brown fat to keep them warm, the amount of brown fat in adults may have dropped in tandem with our cosy, centrally-heated modern lives.

The researchers said: ‘It has been noted that outdoor workers in northern Finland who are exposed to cold temperatures have a significant amount of brown fat when compared to same-aged indoor workers but overall the per centage of brown fats in adults is small compared to white fat.’

Mice with high levels of the browning protein also found it easier to process sugar – something that should cut their odds of diabetes, the journal Cell Metabolism reports.

Researcher Jon Dempersmier said: ‘Brown fat is active, using up calories to keep the body warm. It will burn fat, it will burn glucose.

‘The idea is that if we can harness this, we can try to use this in therapy for weight loss and diabetes.’

The research backs up the Ice Diet, a slimming plan that includes advice such as starting each day with a glass of cold water, sleeping in a cool room and ending a shower with a bracing blast cold water.

In future, it may be possible increase levels of the browning protein – and so brown fat - without the need to endure the cold.

Lead scientist Hei Sook Sul said: ‘If you can somehow increase levels of this protein through drugs, you could have more brown fat and could possibly lose more weight even if eating the same amount of food.’

Others say that low temperatures will only help us lose weight if we don’t compensate for the calories burnt off by the new brown fat.

Lacking calories and miserable in the cold, it may be all too easy to reach for a bar of chocolate.
