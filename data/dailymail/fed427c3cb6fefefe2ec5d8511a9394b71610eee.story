Disgraced news anchor Brian Williams has resigned from the Congressional Medal of Honor Foundation’s board of directors after he was caught lying about his war reporting experiences.

Ron Rand, the head of the foundation, put out a very brief statement yesterday saying Williams had resigned, adding that he had been in the position since 2006.

The news comes after Williams was banned by NBC from making public appearances while serving a six-month unpaid suspension from the network for false reporting.

Williams' name has been trashed in recent weeks after it emerged he lied about being in a helicopter that came under fire while reporting on the Iraq War in 2003.

Bob Wright, a personal friend of Williams and the former chairman and CEO of NBC, said the decision was difficult, but NBC believes it was necessary in order to 'get past' the scandal that has besieged Williams. 

Banned: NBC have told news anchor Brian Williams not to be make any formal public appearances - such as events and speeches - as he sees out a six month suspension over claims of false reporting. Williams is seen here at the LA premiere of the film Neighbors in April 2014 

Tough decision: Bob Wright, NBC's former chairman and CEO, confirmed Williams is not allowed to attend scheduled appearances while he is suspect. The long-time friends are seen here together in 1996

The decision has lead to a series of cancellations of events that Williams was scheduled to appear, including Palm Beach Civic Association's annual awards luncheon on February, where he was to give the keynote address.

'I feel terrible about it,' Wright told Palm Beach Daily News. 'But life goes on. We'll get past it.'

Wright also told the newspaper that Williams is 'considerably restrained' as he deals with the suspension.

'He is just struggling,' Wright said. 'It’s very tough. He is a very people-oriented person. He’d certainly like to get on and explain what he has done and apologize. It’s going to take time.' 

Williams could lose his job if bosses decide he has brought himself into disrepute after it emerged he falsely claimed he was in a helicopter that came under fire while in Iraq.  

The foundation is a non-profit organisation which works to promote the Medal of Honor and support projects which encourage the values it represents.

Chief among them is integrity. The foundation's website says: 'We believe that the mark of a true hero is to have the moral courage to do what needs to be done because it is the right thing to do.'

The other values  are courage, sacrifice, patriotism, citizenship and commitment.

A statement on the foundation's website from co-chairmen Jack Jacobs, president Bruce Whitman and CEO Ron Rand simply said: 'Brian Williams has resigned from the Congressional Medal of Honor Foundation Board of Directors. 

'He had served in that position since September 2006.'

An investigation has been launched into his reporting, especially the Iraq incident, which he said happened while covering the war in 2003.

The probe is also looking into his reports about seeing a body floating by during Hurricane Katrina and his presence at the fall of the Berlin wall.

The 55-year-old faces the possibility of being fired because of a 'morality clause' in his contract that says his role can be terminated if he brings himself into disrepute. 

Williams, who has been the nightly news anchor for 10 years, had recently signed a $10 million, five-year pact, Page Six reported. 

The defining clause in his contract said: 'If artist commits any act or becomes involved in any situation, or occurrence, which brings artist into public disrepute, contempt, scandal or ridicule, or which justifiably shocks, insults or offends a significant portion of the community, or if publicity is given to any such conduct . . . company shall have the right to terminate.' 

Weekend anchor Lester Holt has temporarily taken Williams' place. 

The show has seen a significant drop in viewers since Williams was taken off air. 

In a statement, NBC chief executive Stephen Burke wrote: 'By his actions, Brian has jeopardized the trust millions of Americans place in NBC News. His actions are inexcusable and this suspension is severe and appropriate.

His claims came to light after a show was broadcast, featuring Williams describing how in 2003 he had survived his helicopter being shot down by a rocket propelled grenade.

His account was challenged by people who were in the actual craft that was hit and it emerged the NBC anchor was in fact in another helicopter entirely, around an hour behind the targeted helicopter. 

NBC Nightly News Anchor Brian Williams revealed he incorrectly assumed a helicopter he was travelling in had been shot down after it was part of a convoy that made an unscheduled landing in Iraq in 2003 

After the inaccuracies emerged Williams said he made a mistake about being in a Chinook helicopter that was shot down in 2003 because he was scared and in a warzone for the first time. 

NBC has launched an official probe into Williams, led by Richard Esposito, its top investigative journalist. 

Williams, who is Managing Editor of the United States' most watched network news program, has remained quiet since the allegations came to light and took himself off the air before he was temporarily suspended.

But his silence has not stopped him becoming a figure of ridicule.

In an awkward red carpet interview for the 40th anniversary of Saturday Night Live, comedian Jim Carrey asked Today newscaster Matt Lauer  'Where are you hiding Brian Williams?'

Jerry Seinfeld also made jokes about the newscaster during the show.

Red Bank, New Jersey, 1970s

In a 2011 interview, Brian Williams recalled his time as a teenage volunteer firefighter during which he saved a puppy. However in a 2005 Esquire interview, Williams had claimed to save not one but two puppies.

In the same Esquire interview Williams also revealed that he had been mugged at gunpoint while selling Christmas trees in the sleepy New Jersey town in which he grew up.

A number of locals have questioned the credibility of his claim that someone 'stuck a .38-caliber in my face'.

Berlin Wall, 1989  

Tom Brokaw was historically the only American anchor present at the fall of the Berlin Wall. 

But during a 2008 forum at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, Williams claimed he was at the Brandenburg gate 'the night the wall came down.' 

And although in a 2004 interview Williams said he arrived at the wall 'a day after -- more like 12 hours after -- Tom Brokaw did,' at a gala in 2014 he stated: '25 years ago tonight Tom Brokaw and I were at the Berlin Wall'.   

Iraq War, 2003

Over the years Williams has told multiple versions of a story about being in an Army Chinook helicopter during the Iraq War in 2003.

Last month he claimed his helicopter was hit by ground fire, an allegation he was later forced to admit was false after an outcry from soldiers who were present.

Williams issued an on-air apology and wrote on Facebook: 'Nobody's trying to steal anyone's valor.'

Hurricane Katrina, 2005

Williams has told several stories about his experiences reporting from New Orleans.

He has claimed to have seen a dead body float past the window of his hotel in the city's French Quarter – even though the area wasn't flooded.

The accuracy of other Katrina claims, including that he caught dysentery drinking the flood waters and that his hotel was 'overrun' with gangs, have been called into question by others who were on the ground during the disaster.

Israel, 2006

In a 2007 interview with Fairfield University Student Television, Williams recalled 'Katyusha rockets passing just underneath the helicopter I was riding in' during a trip to Israel.

In fact he was nowhere near enemy fire and in a broadcast segment filmed that day he described rocket fire 'six miles away'.

Boston, 2006

A Navy vet accused Williams of lying to skip an event honoring members of the Armed Forces so that he could appear on Saturday Night Live.

On the day of the Congressional Medal of Honor Society event the NBC News anchor told organizers that a 'pressing engagement' meant he wouldn't be able speak at the dinner, but later that evening he appeared in a walk-on role on SNL's Weekend Update.
