John Bilardi is paralysed with an unbearable sense of guilt as he tries to make any sense of what would possess his son, now known as Jihadi Jake, to volunteer to sacrifice his own young life for the Islamic State.

On the surface Jake Bilardi was far from what is perceived as a stereotypical recruit for an extremist Islamic group: a white boy from suburban Australia who, as the youngest of six children, had an atheist upbringing.

However, even his father admits you didn't have to dig too deep to see that his 18 year-old son was a troubled soul and now he will live with a life of immense regret.

Jake Bilardi's father John (pictured left) has spoken to 60 Minutes about his son's decision to join an extremist Islamic group 

Although no one could have foreseen that the loner, who turned his back on the real world, was living a secret second life locked away in his bedroom in Melbourne on the internet for the past 18 months as he slowly but surely assumed his new persona as Abu Abdullah al-Australi.

The painfully shy boy had never been happier after converting to Muslim and regularly attending mosques but his new lifestyle choice did not end there as he flew to the Middle East in December which ultimately cost him his life  in a failed suicide mission in Iraq last week.

His father struggled to find any words to describe his pain and overwhelming sense of guilt when he spoke to 60 Minutes reporter Michael Usher which airs on Sunday night.

'He is at a complete loss to try to understand any of it - he's trying to put the picture together now on not a lot of information at all to be honest - he is learning as much as anyone else is learning in the public forum,' Usher told Daily Mail Australia.

John finds it even more difficult to comprehend that his son had plans to orchestrate what would have been a deliberate act of mass murder right in his very own city where he had lived his whole life.

'He can barely talk about it all he struggles for words with the fact that his son had plan B which was to commit a major act of terror in Melbourne and had begun buying the chemicals for the bombs before he disappeared out of Australia,' Usher said.

'That atrocity John can not understand at all - the family are desperately trying to now go back and understand who Jake was because he wasn't the kid they thought he was and tragically all of the warning signs were there of a kid in trouble.'

When Usher suggested there were clear warning signs that his son had issues, John agreed saying: 'yes they were and I'm so sorry I didn't do anything about it.'

'He said he was at times very difficult emotionally - even as a little boy,' Usher said.  

'He also said "I'm sorry I wish i could have done more to understand my son and stop him" and he's finding it very hard to grieve because he's feeling so much guilt,' Usher said.

To add to Jake's complexities, his mother died from cancer in 2012 and was then looked after by his five older siblings as his parents had divorced years earlier. 

His father described his son as an 'extremely shy' loner who felt alienated from his family and even expressed in one of his blogs that he felt unsafe with his siblings.

He said he felt he should have known about the full extent of his son's bullying.

'I wish I could understand more of what went on,' he told Usher.

But John also feels that his son was brainwashed and believes that he was a 'soft target for' the Islamic recruiters.

His former fellow pupils also described Jake as a loner who walked around with his hands in his pockets and spoke seriously all of time about Middle Eastern politics.

Although it was unusual that the child from an atheist background converted to Muslim there was nothing to suggest that he was acting radically in his public life but online he was in active contact with Islamic State recruiters. 

Jake organised to get a passport and told his family he wanted to work at a charity in Uganda.

'He went online from writing about his love of soccer and wanting to buy a dog to children allowed to join the jihad and I cant wait for my pilgrimage to Mecca in December,' Usher said. 

The last time John ever saw his son was when he asked for his birth certificate in order to get a passport and said he seemed uncharacteristically 'upbeat'.

'He said he was articulate and clear and seemed happy and in fact in the last communications he seemed very content and he said to his dad "I feel comfort being a Muslim and I feel comfort in Islam", Usher said.

'John was optimistic that his son was on a good path that after the divorce and feeling alienated he thought that his son had found some happiness and peace.'

However, these feelings were short-lived as John had a growing concern for his son's welfare by the last time he ever heard from Jake again in the form of a Facebook message when was in the Middle East.

'The message was pretty veiled other than to say that he was in the region and had some intent,' Usher said.

John was understandably panicked but couldn't find a lot of places to turn to get help and was at a great loss at what to do.

'In fact even at that point, there was still some disbelieving that maybe this was just some great romantic notion of Jake's and he was off some ridiculous journey,' Usher said. 

'Then he couldn't contact him and had no further communication from him and John learned of his son's death as it appeared in the media last week.' 

John send a warning out to all parents to be more aware about who their children are interacting with online.

'It's going on, it's happening, it's real it's not just from a Muslim background, it's anybody they can find, any soft target they will aim, human life means nothing to them,' John told Usher.

'I could tell he was brainwashed but they are such a powerful influence.'

His father never wants to hear again the words that his son will be forever known as -  'Jihadi Jake'  but instead hold onto the memory of his beloved son.

'He's trying to preserve a little bit of who the Jake was that he knew and loved - the kid who loved soccer, the kid who used to run around in the backyard and play in the park with his dad

'He said that's the Jake I need to remember - Jihadi Jake I don't even want to hear that name because I don't even know who that person is and that's not my son.'
