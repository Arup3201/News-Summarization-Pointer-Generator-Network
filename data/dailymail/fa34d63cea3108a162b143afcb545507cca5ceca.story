The perfect age for a woman to start a diet is 32 – Kate Middleton’s age - according to new research.

Women of that age - including singer Beyoncé - find it easiest to lose weight and stick to a diet plan.

For men the best age to diet is 31 – the same age as Prince William.

Both sexes said their early 30s was the optimum time for weight loss because turning 30 was a watershed moment in their lives and they wanted to stay fit and healthy as they leave their 20s.

People are less likely to stick to diets in their mid-30s and 40s because they are not so bothered about their appearance as ageing takes its toll and they embrace middle age, according to 54 per cent of dieters.

Almost six out of ten slimmers - 59 per cent - said that diets are more likely to go awry in the 20s because people are more likely to be single and to party more.

The findings come from a survey of 1,000 male and female slimmers by the diet company Forza Supplements.

The overwhelming majority of those polled - 82 per cent - said that 30 was a 'watershed' age for both sexes and they were more likely to stick to diets afterwards.

More than a third of female respondents - 37 per cent - found the ages of 30 to 35 the best to slim.

Amongst this group 32 was the ideal age for women.

Another factor making it the optimum for women to slim is the likelihood that they had become mothers.

The average age of women giving birth in the UK is now a few weeks short of 30 - while first time mothers are older than ever at 28.

Losing baby weight is a powerful incentive for women to slim with 56 per cent saying they had found it easier to lose weight after childbirth than before.

Marriage was also a factor in helping women to lose weight.

Four out ten female respondents - 42 per cent - said they found it easier to lose weight after marrying because they are less likely to drink and eat to excess.

The average age for a new bride in the UK is 30.

For men, 36 per cent said the ages of 30 to 35 were the most effective years to diet - with 31 the optimum age.

Men's ideal age was a year less than women's because turning 30 was seen as a bigger watershed for them.

Forza managing director Lee Smith said: ‘There is no doubt that turning 30 is a big moment for both sexes.

‘The ageing process starts to catch up with us all and both sexes are desperate to turn back the clock.

‘They are both in the right frame of mind to diet - and that's why they are both better able to lose weight around that age.

‘This is certainly true of the typical Forza dieter who is a young mum in her early 30s keen to lose a bit of weight after starting a family.’

The early 30s are the best time for dieting as turning 30 is a 'watershed'

@highlight

When people are in their 20s they struggle to diet due to more partying

As they get older they tend to become less concerned about their looks

So, the 40s and 50s are not ideal for dieting as people lack motivation
