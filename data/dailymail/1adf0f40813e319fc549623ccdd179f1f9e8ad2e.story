It was the wackiest police chase anyone can remember - armed officers in the Chinese capital Beijing pursuing a runaway ostrich.

The flight-less bird – which in short bursts can reach 45mph - set the pace when he escaped from a farm and hit the asphalt running.

‘He was fast and he was big,’ said onlooker Chou Mai-an. ‘People stuck in traffic had to look twice when they saw it come up alongside them and cyclists had to swerve to get out of its way.’

Winging it: The ostrich was snapped running at speed besides traffic in China's capital, Beijing

The big bird, which is twice as fast as a road runner, got police headquarters in a flap, with several traffic patrol cars having to be diverted to monitor its progress through the city, because of fears it would distract drivers and cause an accident.

A police spokesman said: ‘We checked with the main zoo and it hadn't escaped from there so we are assuming it was either someone's private pet or broke out of an ostrich farm - there are several around. They are reared for their meat and eggs.

‘The bird was not violent but its beak is capable of blinding a human if it chose to attack, and its feet can do severe damage as well. Eventually we managed to overpower it with the help of a bird expert.’

Bird of a feather: The ostrich was eventually caught by armed police and an expert handler and taken to an animal shelter

The hunt is now on to reunite the bird with its rightful owner. It is being cared for in a Beijing animal shelter until they can be traced.

The ostrich is the world’s largest bird and its long legs help it to achieve its remarkable top speed.Its stride can stretch to between 10 and 16 feet. Although it can only reach 45mph for short periods, it can run for long distances at around 30mph.

Last year CCTV footage (above) emerged of an ostrich on the loose in Zhangzhou city in China, with the bird caught dashing at speed at night between cars and motorbikes.

A few seconds into the clip it is struck by a car - but it gets up after a few moments and runs off.
