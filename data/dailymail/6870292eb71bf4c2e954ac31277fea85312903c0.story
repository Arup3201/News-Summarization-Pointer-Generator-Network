Dubbed 'Siberia's greatest export' the dancers of Fraules Dancing Centre, in Novosibirsk, have achieved worldwide acclaim

Apart from the sheer skill of the dance routine, Fraules is a great Siberian business success story

Yelena's 
academy has gained a global audience after a video of the training regime of
 the some of the dancers was posted on the internet.

The
 international spotlight on Yelena's school came as a result of a video made by 
Zhenya Remizovskiy, which has now amassed more than 30 million 
hits on YouTube.

Yelena
 said: 'I think we were incredibly lucky to find Zhenya, that video got 
so successful first because Major Lazer reposted it - that immediately 
brought more people to us, and then the tune went on radio and TV and 
became really popular among dance hall dancers.'

Major Lazer is an electronic music project created by American DJ and record producer Diplo.Yelena
 said: 'Then the media noticed us - so now every week it adds a million 
more hits, I am not even always sure how it happens.

The academy has gained global appeal after a video of the training regime of the some of the dancers was posted on the internet

Many of the school's classes are held in the evening as the dancer either work or study during the day

'We filmed
 it not only to promote our school, but to show how great it is here in 
Siberia. It is fantastic to see that it worked, and naturally it helps 
our dancing centre's popularity.'

The video follows a women, who, despondent about the minus 42 C temperature, begins to dream of warmer climates.

Her daydream follows a group of scantily clad Fraules dancers working some serious moves against a tropical looking sunset, before stripping down further to twerk on a sandy beach.

Apart
 from the sheer skill of the dance routine Fraules is a great Siberian 
business success story in Novosibirsk, our biggest city, and the third 
largest in Russia.

Yelena
 said: 'I am aged 23 and was born here, I have lived here all my life. 
Two years ago I got my diploma from the faculty of business at 
Novosibirsk State Technical University.

'I
 began dancing when I was ten years old. For about seven years I was 
going to 'Todes' dancing studio, and then began adding various master 
classes to improve my skills, including the foreign master classes.

'Then I began teaching myself and in 2010 I opened my own school.'

The video, which has so far received over 30 million views on YouTube follows the daydream of a young girl

Twerk, which is a separate style when you shake your derriere, has gained popularity in recent years

The video which brought the academy worldwide fame sees the dancers move to the beach and strip down further

Besides the considerable talent of the dancers, it is not hard to see why the video has been viewed so many times

Owner of the school, Siberian born Yelena, 23, regularly organizes dance competitions and battles for her dancers

'I am very grateful to my teacher Yulia Masayeva - she got me into hip-hop, house, dance hall, popping and locking styles.

'In
 the end we chose dance hall, and later I got to vogue style. She got me
 to go to Moscow for master classes, then I went for four trips to Paris
 to visit various dancing classes.

'This is my life now - my school is my work, my business, the main thing I do.

'Our
 main classes are in the evening since our students either study or 
work, but there is a lot to do before that, and I constantly think about
 my school with a view to improving it. I want it to be bigger than just
 a dance class, though of course there are people that just want to 
come, have a dance class and leave.

'But many other students want to learn dancing with a view to take part in competitions - and win. This is what we help them do. 

Young ladies carefully watch themselves as they perform a 'twerking' routine, for which Frayles has become known for

Due to the sexual nature of twerking, the school only takes girls aged 16 or over

'It helped
 me to get business education, I went there with a thought of opening my
 own business one day. I am so happy it turned out that way.

'We
 organise most of our city's dance battles and competitions. The most 
recent and biggest of them was in May where we had eight choreographers,
 including our star guest Danielle Polanco.'

As well as being Beyonce's choreographer, Danielle was the leading lady in Omarion's music video Touch.

She
 also starred in the 2008 movie Step Up 2: The Streets, in which she 
portrayed Missy Serrano, and appeared in the Broadway revival of West 
Side Story as one of the Shark girls, Consuela.

Yelena
 said: 'The main goal for dancers is to take part in as many 
competitions outside Novosibirsk and Russia - and win - as possible'.

'Of
 course, it is not easy to travel as much as they wish as tickets can be
 expensive, and naturally it takes a lot of dedication to keep on 
training, sometimes months and months of endless rehearsals.

Many of the dancers who train at Fraules want to take part in as many competitions outside Novosibirsk and Russia as possible

'My students went to Moscow with me, soon we were going to the dancing camp. I've been to Europe and twice won competitions in Sweden and Germany.

'There is always a surprised reaction when people abroad hear that you came from Siberia. 'It is so cold there, how on earth can you do training?

'The right name for it is twerk, which is a separate style when you shake your derriere. Booty dance is more like its marketing, commercial name. '

'Girls and women of different ages come to study it - well, except that I try to limit the youngest and stop them from doing it.

'I think it is not correct from the moral point of view to teach 13, 14, 15-year-old girls, because the movements carry a quite clear connotation.

'They beg me to take them, and even their parents call me and plead to teach their children, saying that they give their permission.

'It is certainly an energetic and beautiful dance routine, by my position is that you should start it from an older age - at least from 16'.

'Perhaps you can compare us to America with their Broadway Dance Centre where a person can come and 'dive' into one particular dance style.

'They've inspired me to create something similar so that people from different cities can come and spend three months studying and working on one dance style. We are moving towards it gradually.'
