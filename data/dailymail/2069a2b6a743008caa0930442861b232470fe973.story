Sick of short hair or desperate for a change? Chantelle Houghton might just have the answer for you.

The reality TV star, who previously owned a fashion boutique in her native Essex, has announced that she is turning her hand to haircare.

Chantelle, 31, is releasing a 12-piece hair extension collection named 'Chantelles', which includes a clip-in pony and a sleek fishtail plait. 

Chantelle Houghton has launched a new 12-piece extensions range with prices ranging from £13.99

Chantelle says that she has stopped wearing extensions full time and now prefers clip in pieces 

She said of the range, which costs from £13.99: 'I have personally chosen every piece.

'I have been using hair extensions for years but recently went back to my natural hair. 

'I love mixing up my hair and using different styles and this is the perfect solution.'

Adding: 'It's been a really exciting road to launching the collection. I have learned a lot over the years and it has been amazing to work on a business from the initial idea to making it a reality.

'I am fully involved in it and loving it. And I feel like i am in a good position to advise people about hair - after all every knows how much I love big hair.

'There really is something for everyone and hair is so important to every girl and woman. I wear them all the time, they are so easy to use and give an instant salon look. We will be updating the range regularly too.'

Each piece in the collection comes in nine different colours which means you can match them to your natural hair.

Chantelle - who appeared in Celebrity Big Brother in 2006 - is not the first reality TV star to try her hand at the beauty industry.
