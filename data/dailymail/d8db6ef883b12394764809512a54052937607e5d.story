Chelsea forward Diego Costa has acknowledged that he will need to adapt his style in order to be a success with Spain.

The 25-year-old has hit the ground running in the Premier League so far, scoring four times in three games as Jose Mourinho's side have begun the new season with a 100% record, but has struggled to replicate that form with his national side.

Costa started the first two games at the World Cup, struggling for form as Spain lost 5-1 to Holland and 2-0 to Chile, before being dropped for their dead rubber victory over Australia in their final encounter.

And after failing to find the back of the net in their underwhelming 1-0 at the hands of Paris in France on Thursday night - with his new Chelsea team-mate Loic Remy netting the winner - Costa has now gone five international games without a goal since he switched allegiances from Brazil. 

'I really want to score with Spain,' he told Marca after the game. 'Our game is to have the ball a lot, have a lot of possession.

'I am [aware] that I have to adapt to them.

'Things are going very well for me at Chelsea and that encourages me to keep improving.' 

Costa will be hoping to be an integral part of the new-look Spanish side as they aim to transition away from their golden generation of stars following their World Cup debacle.

Stalwarts such as Xavi, Xabi Alonso and David Villa have all announced their international retirements since the tournament, whilst David de Gea was preferred in goal to Iker Casillas.

Also in were the likes of Real Madrid youngster Dani Carvajal, Atletico Madrid's star Koke and 25-year-old Athletic Bilbao forward Mikel San Jose making his international debut.

France, meanwhile, started with 10 of the players that featured in their 1-0 World Cup quarter-final defeat at the hands of Germany, with Moussa Sissoko in for Yohan Cabaye the only change.
