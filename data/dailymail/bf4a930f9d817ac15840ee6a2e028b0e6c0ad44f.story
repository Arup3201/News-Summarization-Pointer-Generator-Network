Donald Sterling's mistress was not only able to trick him on the phone but new photos reveal that she was able to convince him she was a decade younger as well.

Pictures show that V. Stiviano and her octogenarian lover celebrating her '21st' birthday on October 25 even though she is actually 31-years-old.

The photos show Sterling standing next to his model girlfriend as she is presented with a cake in the style of a basketball.

Rather than drawing a sporting goods brand name on the cake, the birthday 'girl's' moniker was written across the ball.

She is seen playfully threatening to put icing on her beau's face, and he smiles as he turns away in vain. 

The celebration was held inside the Staples Center where the Clippers play their home games and Stiviano is seen wearing a low-cut floor length teal gown that she was pictured wearing at the basketball game that same day.

Stiviano is in a far less celebratory mood lately, and a source close to the self-described 'artist,lover,writer,chef, poet,stylist, philanthropist' has been getting death threats since a recording of a phone call between her and Sterling was leaked.

All in the details: She was seen carrying a multi-thousand dollar Hermes bag

On her way: Friends say Stiviano has started going to counseling as a result of the backlash from the racist recording scandal that led to the ban of Donald Sterling from the NBA

'V started getting death threats almost immediately after Sterling’s racist rants — which she recorded — were made public,' an unidentified source told Radar.

'Most of the threats were made on social media, and this is one of the reasons why she has scaled back her activity. It has been very scary for V, and she also hired a bodyguard.'

She should get used to it though if she decides to seek off.

'One day, I will become President of the United States of America, and I will change the legislation and laws,” Stiviano told one news camera outside her home this week in bizarre comment.

'Modern day history. Civil rights movement.'

She reportedly has a number of other recordings involving both her lover, Donald Sterling, and his estranged wife, Shelly, but those tapes are being kept in a 'secure and safe location'.

'V has also been in contact with a counselor to deal with the stress of the fallout of the scandal,' the source said.

It's a look: Stiviano has been wearing visor hats popular in Asia ever since the tape was leaked on Saturday

The nature of the tapes where Shelly is heard have not been revealed, but the source says that she is 'extremely candid, unfiltered, and very different' than how she has been portraying herself since her estranged husband's recording was released on Saturday.

'While Shelly doesn’t make any racist comments, it gives the public an inside look into who she really is behind closed doors... She also swears like a sailor. Her tapes will definitely raise eyebrows,' the unidentified source reveals.

In addition to earlier court documents which named Shelly as part of a discrimination lawsuit filed against the couple by their former tenants, with one African American resident claiming that she called him a 'black motherf*****' during an argument, there is a new damning video.

Guarded: The mistress (pictured on Tuesday) has hired security since she has been the subject of death threats via social media

Taking turns: If not her formal bodyguard, this friend accompanied her to a car wash where her red Ferrari was taken care of on Wednesday

She is shown walking into one of her husband's buildings and posing as a health inspector and answering to a fake name.

The Radar source also makes claims about the nature of Stiviano's relationship with Sterling that calls into question their motives.

The source said that 'V absolutely didn’t have a sexual relationship with Donald' even though that is directly contradicted in the court papers filed against her by Shelly in an effort to get back some of the millions of dollars in gifts she was given during the course of their relationship.

'Donald enjoyed the attention a young woman would give him. Yes, he did give her very extravagant gifts, but it was based on a friendship,' the source claimed.

Her lies about her birth date are just the latest in a web of reinvention that she has spun for herself over the years.

The 31-year-old lives in an impressive $1.8m condo in an upscale, tree-lined avenue in Los Angeles, close to Beverly Hills.

Skating to notoriety: V. Stiviano is pictured outside her LA home on Tuesday. Her rise to fame is all the more startling given her poor Texan childhood marred by tragedy

Mystery woman: Stiviano - or V as she now likes to be known - has changed her name and moved between LA and San Antonio, Texas - where her family lives in Section 8 housing - throughout her 31 years

Reveling in her moment: Stiviano moved to LA to find fame and fortune and allegedly had plastic surgery to improve her 'below average looks'. Now she has found it thanks to the recordings of Donald Sterling's racism

Know my name: Born Maria Pererz, Stiviano changed her name in 2010, for a very disturbing reason adding: 'I haven't yet been fully accepted because of her race'

School days: Stiviano, who was born Maria Perez, allegedly attending Roosevelt High School in East Los Angeles - the same school Sterling and his wife attended in the 50s

She owns a bright red Ferrari, two top of the line Bentleys, a sporty Range Rover and a designer wardrobe to match - all of it bought for her by the man she eventually brought down.

But a MailOnline investigation can revealed the full story behind Stiviano that gives some insight into why she apparently burned her sugar daddy-sponsored life of luxury for the bigger prize of fame and notoriety - and just why she may have chosen racist Sterling as her springboard.

Stiviano turned her back on her dirt-poor upbringing in San Antonio, Texas, where she was raised by a jobless Mexican mother convicted of using her own children to steal from a supermarket - to seek her fame and fortune in Los Angeles.

There she got herself noticed through modelling and has even been linked to Jerry Buss, the late owner of the LA Lakers and friend of Sterling.

We can also reveal how Stiviano suffered bad skin problems which knocked her self-confidence in her teens, turning to plastic surgery to transform her looks.

Most shockingly of all however, MailOnline has discovered why Stiviano, who was born Maria Perez, changed her name in 2010 to wipe out her past.

MailOnline has seen the documents, but has chosen not to publish it due to its sensitive nature, but giving a reason for her name change, Stivano claimed in the court papers she hadn't 'yet been fully accepted because of my race'.

Stiviano's recordings, in which Sterling is heard telling her not to associate with black people, sparked wide-spread revulsion across America and resulted in the NBA handing Sterling, 81, a lifetime ban preventing him from attending any future NBA basketball games. 

Scandal: Stiviano has shot to fame after recording LA Clippers boss, Donald Sterling, berating her for hanging around with black people. She has been by his side since 2010 after they met at a Super Bowl game

He has also been slapped with a hefty $2.5million fine and his ownership of the Clippers – a franchise now estimated to be worth a staggering $430 million - now hangs in the balance.

Stiviano's lawyer insists that she didn't leak audio recordings of Sterling's vile racist rants. She said she felt 'bad' for him.

But Stiviano, up until now a mysterious figure who has been wearing a bizarre visor over her face, certainly seems to be lapping up the attention.

Her cat-like face has appeared on hundreds of TV networks, in newspapers and on news websites around the world and at last count her followers on Instagram had jumped to more than 164,000.
