Education Minister Chris Pyne refused to support Treasurer Joe Hockey's comments that poor people 'don't have cars or actually don't drive very far', despite being asked the question directly six times during an interview.

Mr Pyne was asked whether he agreed with Joe Hockey's controversial comments when he appeared on the Today show this morning with Shadow Infrastructure Minister Anthony Albanese.

Mr Pyne stated that the treasurer had the government's 'full support' and that he wouldn't 'cop any criticism of Joe Hockey on these remarks', but when directly asked whether he supported Mr Hockey's comments that 'poor people don't drive' he refused to answer, instead repeating that Joe Hockey was doing 'an inspirational job as treasurer'.

Education Minister Chris Pyne was asked six times during a television interview whether he supported Joe Hockey's controversial comments

Mr Albanese jumped in, pointing out Mr Pyne's refusal to back Mr Hockey's comments explicitly, telling the Education Minister: 'You had six opportunities to support what he said and you refuse to do so. Why? Because what he said was rubbish.'

'If you are in an outer suburb or a regional community you have no choice but to drive and this is the guy who cut all funding for public transport in the budget… and then he says that poor people don't have cars or don't drive very far,' Mr Albanese said.

'[Mr Hockey] should go to western Sydney today and have a look at people driving all the way in to the city, or all the way into their workplace in any capital city from the outer metropolitan areas, they spend a higher proportion of their income than high income earners.'

Mr Hockey has come under fire after remarking to ABC Radio on Wednesday that rich people spend more on fuel than poor households.

'The poorest people either don't have cars or actually don't drive very far in many cases,' he said.

Mr Pyne said he thought Joe Hockey was doing 'an inspirational job' as treasurer but refused to confirm whether or not he supported Joe Hockey's comments that 'poor people don't drive'

Joe Hockey has come under fire for his comments, which were made on ABC Radio as he was defending the government's proposed fuel excise

Mr Hockey made the controversial comments while defending the government's proposed fuel indexation, a budget measure opposed by both Labor and the Greens who say it will hit low-income families the hardest.

The comments have caused widespread outrage, prompting Opposition Leader Bill Shorten to call Mr Hockey 'the cigar-chomping, Foghorn Leghorn of Australian politics', as well leading to criticism from Greens MPs, Coalition MPs and welfare groups.

NSW Nationals senator John Williams and Queensland Liberal National senator Ian Macdonald criticised Hockey's comments on the grounds that people in the bush need cars.

'You have to have a car whether you're rich or poor, you need a vehicle to be able to get from one place to the other,' Mr Macdonald told ABC Radio on Thursday.

'Regional Australians don't have the alternative of public transport of other means of getting there.'

Mr Hockey was also lambasted on social media with people using the hashtag #OtherThingsThePoorDontDo to poke fun at Mr Hockey's remark.

Tony Abbott was also questioned about Mr Hockey's gaffe, which occurred while the prime minister was in the United Arab Emirates visiting Australian personnel participating in the international humanitarian aid drops in northern Iraq.

He refused to directly address Mr Hockey's comments, instead saying: 'I'm very proud of the budget the treasurer and I have brought about. I want to focus on the fundamental challenge facing the country… how do we get our economy under control?'
