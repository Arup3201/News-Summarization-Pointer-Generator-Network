Most Wanted: Yaser Abdel Said, 57, is wanted for killing his two daughters in 2008

A man suspected of carrying out brutal 'honor killings' on his two teenage daughters on New Year's Day 2008 has been added to the FBI's Ten Most Wanted list.

Yaser Abdel Said, 57, allegedly shot dead Amina, 18, and Sarah, 17, in a hotel parking lot in Irving, Texas, after driving them there in his taxi.

The girls were found slumped in the car, both with multiple gunshot wounds. In 911 calls moments before they died, Sarah told operators 'Help! My dad shot me' and 'Oh my God, I'm dying'.

According to the Dallas Morning News, relatives said Said would often beat his daughters, and killed them both when he found out they had American boyfriends.

Said, an Egyptian, was last seen in 2008. FBI investigators say Said carries a gun at all times, and is dangerous to approach. An official profile states that he always wears dark sunglasses, even indoors.

He is said to love eating at IHOP and Denny's, and black German shepherd dogs. He smokes Marlboro Light 100 cigarettes and is likely to be working as a taxi driver.

The Bureau said Said, an Egyptian, has links to the states of New York, Virginia and Texas, as well as Canada and Egypt. He is likely to be sheltering in Egyptian communities.

It is widely suspected that Said thought his daughters had brought shame on the family so decided to kill them. He has been described as an overly protective parent who exercised a lot of control over his daughters.

According to a recent documentary film about the killings, Amina had sent emails saying she thought her father would kill her. 

FBI officials have offered a $100,000 reward for information that leads to his capture.

On the run: Authorities have been seeking Said since the killings. A description said he has graying black hair, but he has also been photographed bald

Commenting on the renewed attention, the chief of the police force in Irving said his officers 'will not give up' in their pursuit of him.

Chief Larry Boyd said: 'This homicide is particularly disturbing because the one person whom Amina and Sarah Said should have been able to look to for protection is the very person who we believe took their lives.

'Yaser Said has been on the run since he committed this heinous act, but we will not give up on our quest to bring him in.'

The FBI file says Said is 6'2" with black hair, which is graying, and weighs 180lbs. He has also been photographed with a shaved head.

However, they warned he may have changed his appearance to dodge capture.
