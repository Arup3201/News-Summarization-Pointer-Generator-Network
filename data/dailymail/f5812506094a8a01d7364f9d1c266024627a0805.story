A teenager who threatened a shopkeeper and her young daughter with a sawn-off shotgun during a terrifying armed robbery has walked free from court - because he is 'young and impressionable'.

Jack Phillips, 18, from Middlesbrough, burst into the shop in Stafford and waved the 2ft-long loaded weapon at Ranvir Bassi, 35,and her seven-year-old daughter Sattreet.

Dramatic CCTV from the incident in November last year shows the robber pointing the single barrel gun directly at Mrs Bassi’s head while Sattreet hid at her feet.

Jack Phillips, 18, from Middlesbrough, burst into Ranvir Bassi's shop in
 Stafford in November last year and pointed a 2ft loaded gun at her and 
her seven-year-old daughter - but has not been jailed

Mrs Bassi, 35, was shutting up the family-run shop when the 
masked robber charged in - but Recorder Michael Elsom said someone else had possibly forced Phillips to commit the crime

Mrs Bassi - who was awarded £500 for her bravery - is then seen shoving the weapon away before bravely chasing the teenager out of the shop.

But Phillips has now been spared jail because the recorder believes he committed the crime 'under pressure'.

Mrs Bassi - who said her daughter still suffers with nightmares from the incident - has hit out at the 'ridiculous' decision and said she feels as though justice has not been done.

She said: 'I’m shocked, it is a ridiculous decision not to send him to jail.

'He
 terrified me and my family and my daughter still has nightmares about 
it. I can’t believe he is still walking the streets and free to do this 
to again.

'I just want to 
put it all behind me and move on now, and just forget about it. I don’t 
feel like justice has been served at all.'

Mrs Bassi - who said her daughter still suffers with nightmares from
 the incident - grabbed the gun barrel and shoved the intruder away

The shopkeeper was then seen chasing Phillips - who was 17 at the time - out of the shop before calling the police. In court, she was praised for her brave actions

After the incident, CCTV from the footage, which showed Mrs Bassi defending herself against the raider, went viral.

She screamed 'get out of my shop' before pushing the gunman back towards the door and chasing him away. 

Under the Firearms Act, anyone who uses a 
gun with intent should receive a custodial sentence - unless there are 'exceptional circumstances'.

During the hearing at Stafford Crown Court, the court heard how the teen - who was 17 at the time of the offence - was later caught bragging to his friends about the video being on YouTube.

Mrs Bassi, who runs Bassi & Son, said she was 'shocked' at the court's decision not to send the robber to jail

But Recorder Michael Elsom said Phillips'
 age - and the fact others had told him to carry out the offence when he was 'young and impressionable' - meant the
 three-year mandatory jail-term should not be imposed.

Defence solicitor Michael Anning had argued his client did not carry out his threats and the raid was over quickly.

He said the teenager had been under pressure in relation to a debt he 
allegedly owed and the gun was given to him by others to commit the 
offence.

The mother-of-two was awarded £500 by the court after what was described as a 'thoroughly frightening incident'

Sentencing, Mr Elsom said: 'The prosecution can’t exclude the possibility that what you did
 on November 4 was done under the direction of others more criminally 
experienced than yourself, or under pressure.

'I have reports which suggest you are a person particularly susceptible to pressure.

'There
 must be absolutely no doubt that what you did was a very dangerous 
thing indeed, should anyone think I have forgotten the undoubted bravery
 of Mrs Bassi.

'If they had 
the advantage, as I have, of seeing the recording of what occurred, 
no-one who saw that can think it was anything other than a thoroughly 
frightening incident.

'Mrs Bassi behaved with extreme bravery, she didn’t know the gun you had in your hand was quite incapable of being fired.'

The court heard how police found trainers belonging to Phillips near Mrs Bassi’s shop.

They then discovered the shotgun discarded among old bike frames.

The force’s armorer told the court it was an old weapon in a poor state that could have been put into working condition amd was loaded with a live 12-bore round.

Phillips admitted robbery, possessing a firearm with intent to commit robbery and 
possessing a prohibited weapon.

He was sentenced to two years detention, suspended for two years. He was also ordered to carry out 240 hours unpaid community work and given a six-month curfew.

After the hearing, Chief Inspector Jane Hewett, from Staffordshire Police, said: 'I would like to commend Mrs Bassi on her bravery. She showed tremendous courage.'

The incident took place at Bassi & Son newsagent in Stafford, which the family has run for 19 years

Speaking at the time, Mrs Bassi told how her 'mother’s instinct' took over as she grabbed the barrel of the gun to force the thug away.

She said: 'It was just horrific. I was shutting down the shop and he just burst in waving the gun around.

'I really don’t know why I did it, but I guess my mother’s instinct took over, my daughter Sattreet was hiding and I just grabbed the gun.

'He had shouted at me to give him the money and I just shouted ‘no, get out of my shop’ and started shoving him.

'I must have startled him because he turned and ran out of the shop.

'He just picked the wrong day to mess with me - I wasn’t having him take my hard earned cash.'
