A crash on a Chicago highway has sent a 4-year-old boy flying through the rear window, but police say the child's father who was behind the wheel was too drunk to notice.

Franklin Jackson, 46, of Texas, has been charged in connection to his toddler son's death Sunday on Day Ryan Expressway in Chicago. 

According to Illinois State Police, Mr Jackson was heading north on the highway with his wife and four young children at around 4.20pm Sunday when he smashed his Ford Expedition SUV into a guardrail twice.

Franklin Jr was ejected from the vehicle on impact, landing on a grass-covered embankment near the 87th Street exit.

The
 toddler's father reportedly didn't realize his son was not in the car 
until he pulled into a gas station four exits away to check on the 
damage to his SUV, Chicago Tribune reported.

Meanwhile, the 4-year-old was rushed to Comer Children's Hospital, where he was pronounced dead at 5.25pm. 

The Cook County Medical Examiner’s Office determined that the boy died from head trauma.

State
 police said Franklin Jr was among four children under the age of three 
in the car, but was the only one not wearing a seat belt.

The
 victim’s 23-year-old mother, who was also in the SUV, and his siblings,
 two boys ages 1 and 2, and a 3-month-old girl, were not injured in the 
accident. The father suffered broken ribs.

Mr
 Franklin, of League City, Texas, has been charged with reckless 
homicide and aggravated driving under the influence. He was being held 
on $250,000.

Police 
officers who responded to the scene found an empty vodka bottle, an 
empty beer can and an unopened beer in Franklin's car.

According to Prosecutor Maura White, six hours after the crash Franklin's blood alcohol level was .04 per cent, which is below the legal limit, Chicago Sun-Times reported.

But forensic experts estimated that at the time of the collision, his blood alcohol level was between .11 and .15 per cent – nearly twice the legal limit. 

Jackson's wife, Linda Bassett, posted a message on her Facebook page Saturday telling her friends how excited she was about traveling to Chicago to visit her family for the holidays.

'Chicago here we come,' the woman gushed. 'Will be there soon.'

Earlier that day, however, the 23-year-old mother of four expressed some concerns about taking the 1,110-mile trip up north.

'Heavenly farther I pray that you watch over me n[sic] my family on this long trip to Chicago,' she wrote.

In response to a friend's comment about the 17-hour road trip, Miss Bassett promised to be 'very careful.'
