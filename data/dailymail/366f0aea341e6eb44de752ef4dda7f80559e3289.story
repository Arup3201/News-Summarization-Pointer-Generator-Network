The charity which raised over $240,000 dollars for abandoned baby Gammy has revealed it will also buy him and his Thai family a three-bedroom home.

Hands Across the Water has been assisting the now nine-month-old, who was born with Down Syndrome and inspired a commercial surrogacy overhaul, with medical costs since his plight was first revealed.

The funds were supplied by over six thousand people when it was revealed that his biological father, convicted paedophile David Farnell, and his wife Wendy only took his healthy twin sister Pipah home with them to Western Australia.

Peter Baines, the founder and chair of the Australian charity has revealed that up to $140,000 will be used to buy a three-bedroom apartment for Gammy and his mother Pattharamon 'Goy' Janbua, as well as her husband and two other children, News.com.au reports.

'We hope to secure some new accommodation for the family which is close to the private hospital where Gammy will continue to receive care and therapy as he grows,' Mr Baines wrote on the charity's Facebook page.

'The accommodation options also allows the extended family to remain together for support and Goy's older children to remain in their current school.'

Prior to this decision, the charity payed for three months of rent in an apartment for Gammy's family.

Furthermore, a monthly allowance of $530 will be given to the family for everyday living expenses.

The decision was revealed after the charity's founder, Peter Baines, visited the family earlier this month to assess their situation and needs. Pictured: Goy and her three children, including Gammy, with Mr Baines

'In addition to the proposed accommodation solution, funds will be provided to the family on a monthly basis ensuring Gammy has all that he needs,' Mr Baines continued.

'Hands General Manager will remain in weekly contact with Goy to oversee the distribution of funds in the early days and also facilitate the roll out of the medical care plan for Gammy.'

Mr Baines told the Sydney Morning Herald that this allowance will mean Goy can stop working and instead take care of Gammy full-time.

The decisions were made following a visit Mr Baines paid to Gammy and his family on September 22.

Mr Baines described Gammy as: 'a strong little boy who certainly appears healthy and full of life'

'I was able to spend the day on the ground in Thailand (not at donors cost) planning the long term future of Gammy. The morning started with a visit and meeting with the Director of the Private Hospital where Gammy was treated for his pneumonia and where he spent 11 days. We discussed the ongoing treatment and the services that are offered by the hospital.

'I then spent a number of hours with Goy and her grandparents along with her older two children and of course Gammy. During the meeting I was able to listen to Goy and better understand her needs and desires.'

He added: 'Gammy is a strong little boy who certainly appears healthy and full of life.'

Mr Baines said: 'we anticipate the original donated funds being sufficient to see Gammy into early adulthood'

'With the accommodation option that we are pursuing on behalf of the family, the disbursement of income and payment of foreseeable medical costs, we anticipate the original donated funds being sufficient to see Gammy into early adulthood.'

Earlier in the year, Hands Across The Water administered $20,000 towards Gammy's medical costs, including moving him from a public to a private hospital, when he was suffering from a lung infection.

The charity, which has also been providing food, clothes and other supplies to Goy to help her care for Gammy, has often voiced that they do not believe it is in anyone's best interest to provide the child's family with large sums of cash, choosing instead to disperse it.
