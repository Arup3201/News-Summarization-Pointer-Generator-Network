A new Velcro suit for hospital patients could spell the end of the traditional backless gown.

Health managers at Birmingham Children's Hospital NHS Foundation Trust today unveiled the gowns, which are already being used on some of the hospital’s wards.

The Dignity Giving Suits for patients are the first of their type to be used in British hospitals.

Birmingham Children's Hospital NHS Foundation Trust today unveiled new Velcro hospital suits, which are already being used on some of the wards

They have been universally welcomed by the hospital's doctors, surgeons, nurses and also by the patients who have been trialling them.

The wrap-around suits have Velcro fastenings along the seams, doing away with the flimsy tie-backs of the backless gowns used in every hospital up and down the country until now.

Michelle McLoughlin, the hospital's chief nurse, said she had wanted the hospital's young patients to feel ‘protected, safe and secure’, and that the old gowns were failing to make them feel that way, so hospital chiefs authorised a replacement.

When it became clear there was no off-the-shelf solution, they ‘started from scratch’, she said. The entire process from idea to manufacture has taken 18 months.

Mrs McLoughlin said the suits are proving so popular that children have been asking to take them home, while parents have been bemoaning the fact they are currently only available for children.

The hospital's entire stock of 2,000 gowns will be replaced by May.

They will also come in colours and patterns other than the standard dark blue.

Eight-year-old Adam Payne, an 
in-patient who has spent his life in and out of the Birmingham hospital,
said the old gowns had given him nightmares that they were 
uncomfortable.

‘The old ones used to strangle me, and were quite big,’ said Adam, from Walsall in the West Midlands.

‘The new suits are easy to get on and off, they're better, and they don't itch.’

Bev
Ward, managing director of Fashion At Work, which makes the suits, said
the feedback from children using the suits had been ‘tremendous’.

She described the old gowns as 
‘hideous, transparent and cold’ while saying that their replacements are
‘warm, durable, and stylish’.

‘We
wanted to satisfy a diverse clinical need while challenging the 
utilitarian NHS style to give children something fashionable to wear,’ 
she said.

She
hopes the suits, made from 67 per cent polyester and 33 per cent cotton
- similar to the material used for nurse's uniforms - will 
‘revolutionise’ attitudes to designing clinical-wear.

Ms
Ward believes the suits will also be welcomed by adult patients, and 
particularly the elderly, who can struggle with the fiddly ties on the 
backless gowns.

She
is in talks with health bosses at Great Ormond Street Hospital and in 
Nottinghamshire over introducing the new suits for patients there.
