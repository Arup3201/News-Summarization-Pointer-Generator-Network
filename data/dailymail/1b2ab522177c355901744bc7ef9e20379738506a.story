The parents of a sixth form student who committed suicide following a split from her boyfriend warned yesterday about the constant pressure on teenagers from social media.

Lily Cleal, 18, hanged herself from a tree in the back garden in an ‘act of impulse’ after tearfully calling a friend to say she was ‘feeling down and needed a hug.’

Her loving middle class parents had no idea their only child was in such a tormented state and believe there is a ‘taboo’ amongst young people about admitting to feeling depressed.

Lily Cleal, 18, took her own life at her family home in Leeds, West Yorkshire, in December last year after calling a friend to say she was 'feeling down and needed a hug'

Kate Cleal, 53, an IT manager, said 
young people like her daughter were more vulnerable because they could 
not escape from the round-the-clock nature of social media that 
dominates their lives.

She 
said: ‘Once you would have an argument with your boyfriend on the phone 
in the hallway and then you would have to get back to chatting with your
 family where you could think things over. Now with Facebook, Whatsapp, 
snapchat and smart phones it is 24/7.

'There
 is no let up and no natural break to think. Often people feel down and 
don’t vocalise that for fear of being marked as mentally ill.  It means 
they can take themselves off in a moment of darkness and do what they 
do.’

Lily Cleal took her own life in December last year on an 'act of impulse' after becoming concerned it would be difficult to have the same friends as her ex-boyfriend if either of them was to start dating another person

The teenager (pictured when she was younger with her father Quentin) was a popular schoolgirl with a keen interest in sports

Mrs Cleal also called for greater awareness of high suicide rates amongst young people who ‘see things as black and white.’

Between
 600 and 800 people aged under 24 commit suicide every year in England 
and Wales. There are also up to 24,000 suicide attempts made annually by
 10 to 19 year olds, according to the charity Papyrus, which is 
dedicated to tackling the youth suicide problem.

An
 inquest heard how the talented A Level student from Leeds had broken up
 with fellow pupil Danny Capossela, 18, but felt it wasn’t a ‘clean 
break’ as they had the same circle of friends.

No one had anticipated her taking such a drastic step.

Recording a verdict of suicide, the coroner said: 'Lily was a bit of a free spirit and it would appear that she had a probably got a little upset about something'

The teenager (pictured a a child) was an 'independent and free-spirited' girl who was due to take A-level exams at Allerton Grange High School in Leeds

Speaking
 after the inquest, Mrs Cleal said: ‘What Lily did was a completely 
impulsive act. She was an out-going capable person with good upbringing 
and we just didn’t expect this.

‘One
 of our neighbours put it aptly “if Lily could do it, then it could 
happen to any family.” But sadly, like a lot of young people she took a 
temporary problem and gave a permanent solution to it.

‘This
 is the nature of her age group who often tend to see things as black 
and white when they haven’t got the maturity to deal with things 
troubling them. In a moment of darkness they act irrationally.’

She said talking about being suicidal is wrongly a ‘taboo’ topic.

‘Being
 able to say you feel down or feeling like you might do something silly 
should not have the stigma surrounding it that it currently does.

‘For
 Lily, all rational thought had gone. All it might have taken was to 
speak to someone about what was bothering her. Something needs to be 
done to remove the stigma that says it is odd just to say “I am feeling 
down.”’

Lily's mother, Kate Cleal (pictured with her daughter), said: 'What Lily did was a completely impulsive act. She was an out-going capable person with good upbringing and we just didn't expect this'

Following Miss Cleal's death (pictured as a youngster), her parents have called for greater awareness about the 'taboo' of teenage suicide after figures showed up to 800 people aged under 24 take their own lives in England and Wales every year

Lily was described
 as a ‘free-spirited’ young woman and was due to take A Levels in 
History, Psychology, Sociology and English Literature at Allerton Grange
 High School in Leeds.

She was a keen sportswoman and heavily involved in school drama productions.

Lily’s
 parents sat side by side with her former boyfriend as the coroner said 
he was at a ‘complete loss’ to explain why the teenager had committed 
suicide last December.

They
 had been friends since the age of 12 but became an ‘item’ at 16. After 
two years the relationship ended but they remained friends, said coroner
 David Hinchliffe.

He said 
that being part of the same group caused problems. ‘It may be that both 
of them found it difficult if one of the other was seeing someone else.’

On the evening prior to her death, the teenager spent time shopping with her mother Kate in Leeds city centre (pictured together above)

Miss Cleal (pictured left as a child and right as a teenager) was a keen sportswoman who played girls cricket for the school’s under 18s squad along with netball, hockey and swimming. She also wrote a school production

The inquest was told 20 
minutes after making a tearful phone call to her friend, Lily dialled 
999 and said she was going to kill herself. Paramedics rushed to the 
family home only to find her dead when they arrived. Suicide notes were 
left for her parents and the paramedics.

Recording
 a verdict of suicide, coroner David Hinchliffe said Lily’s parents felt
 no animosity towards Danny and still regarded him ‘as a very important 
person in their life.’

He 
said Lily ‘knew her own mind’ and her death may have been the result of 
the ‘headstrong impulsive aspect of her personality coming through.’

After
 the inquest Lily’s father Quentin Cleal, 53, an NHS finance manager, 
said: ‘There is an issue of under recording suicides. Young people who 
patently take their own lives are often deemed not to be considered old 
enough or responsible enough so they are recorded as accidental death.

‘Before
 Lily had done what she had done, I was completely unaware of this - but
 the reality is it has never been a comfortable thing for humans to talk
 about. It seems people feel so black that they see no options.'
