A quaint tea room in the picturesque Peak District has been branded the worst coffee shop in Britain.

Nestled next to a babbling brook in the quaint town of Castleton in Derbyshire, Mike Clarke's Hidden Tea Room should be packed to the rafters.

But he's become a cult figure on TripAdvisor because his customer's experiences are so awful -  with one branding it a 'filthy hovel' and the 'worst place on earth!'

Locals warn people to steer clear of the place and even staff at the nearby tourist information shop winced when we asked for directions there.

Brusque: Mike Clarke, the owner of the Hidden Tea Room in Castleton, Derbyshire, has become famous for his rudeness towards customers

Reviews on TripAdvisor are scathing and include phrases like 'filthy hovel' and 'the worst place on earth'

'It's called the Hidden Tea Room and it should stay that way – hidden,' warned one local.

Another said: 'He's a bit of a character to say the least and really not very nice. He's really rude to customers and scares people away.'

The Tea Room has 127 reviews on the site, with 100 deeming it 'terrible,' nine 'poor' and seven 'average.'

Only three people found it 'excellent' and eight 'very good'.

Visitors tell of being snarled at for only ordering drinks, refused water, shouted at to leave for being hikers as he didn't need their money and even being reduced to tears.

When one woman asked to use the toilet he reportedly handed her a bucket and newspaper. 

Others said the owner was 'rude, 'nasty' and 'dirty', that going there was like being in a League Of Gentleman sketch and a 'horrifying' experience.

Bizarre: A display at the venue. Some people enjoyed their visit as it was an 'experience'

Despite being situated in the Peak District, Mr Clarke has utter contempt for hikers who visit

But defiant Mr Clarke has hit back at the claims. He said: 'I don't give a s*** what people have to say on the internet.

'The comments on TripAdvisor are just moaning prats being nasty. If people want to know what it's like here they should come and see if for themselves.

'There are some customers I don't want in here - the ones who don't spend any money.

'I get walkers come in and order one pot of tea between two of them for two quid. Why would I let them take up a table when it could be filled with people eating and spending money?

'Yes, I'll tell them they can't come in if they're not eating. I go to a lot of effort with my food. If people are coming here because they've read bad reviews on TripAdvisor, as long as they're willing to spend money then I'm happy.

'People might think I'm a cantankerous old thing but I'm old school. I'm used to decent people, like caravanners, who will pay for quality. I've been in business here for 11 years and survived the recession, so I can't be that bad. 

'I just don't want people coming in wanting something for nothing and then going away and moaning on the internet.'

Now reviewers on Trip Advisor are starting to see the funny side. One, named fiftyandchildfree posted last weekend: 'Our main impression was being in a (cold) timewarp with a grumpy Santa moaning about how Castleton was going down the pan, mostly because of hikers not spending anything.

'Whilst I wouldn't recommend this place for the food or ambience, it is an experience that others might like to share - it kept us amused for some time afterwards which is more than you can say for the average cafe/tea shoppe.'

Another, SomeSamP added: 'I think the trouble with this place is its best just discovered by following the hand-written advert scrawled on a piece of wood, and then just accepting and enjoying the bizarre experience - after reading reviews most people wouldn't go, but we had a lot of fun.'
