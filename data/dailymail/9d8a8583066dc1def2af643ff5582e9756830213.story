Billed as a battle of two of England’s most talented No10s but Farrell was picked at inside centre, robbing fans of a direct battle. Sam Peters assesses their performances.

KICKING 

Farrell: tactical kicking heavily criticised in the autumn. No improvement.

Cipriani: more variety than any other English player. Kicked too long, too often.

GAME MANAGEMENT 

Farrell: not as influential at inside centre but still an excellent communicator.

Cipriani: More disciplined these days but struggled to put his stamp on the game.

DISTRIBUTION 

Farrell: Low error count is why England coaches regard him so highly.

Cipriani: Confidence to try the outrageous ... just not yesterday.

DEFENCE 

Farrell: Strong, but rocked by a thunderous Viliami Fihaki charge.

Cipriani: Better but still missed a couple of tackles.
