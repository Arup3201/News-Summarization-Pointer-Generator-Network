Lindsey Vonn is reportedly furious at boyfriend Tiger Woods because he won't commit to being at the Winter Olympics in Sochi to support her in February.The Olympic downhill champion has been back in training for the past week at her Vail, Colorado home base after a serious knee injury at the world championships in Schladming, Austria in February.

Vonn, 29, has been Woods' dedicated cheerleader at the Masters, U.S. Open, British Open, PGA Championship, Players Championship, Tour Championship and President's Cup this year.

She has previously acknowledged that scheduling may make Woods' presence at Sochi difficult, but seemed hopeful the pair could make it work.

'We’re going to see how his schedule goes, but he’s hoping to come,' she told People magazine.

'He’s kind of a fish out of water in the cold weather. It’s going to be really cute!'

But now, according to the National Enquirer, the pair has had 'very nasty' arguments about Woods' apparent disinterest in watching Vonn compete.

Sporting life: Vonn reportedly feels that Woods doesn't support her athletic career but expects her to attend all his events

According to the Enquirer, Lindsey told Tiger, ‘I supported you this season. Now, it’s your turn to support me in public. I’m not just your cheerleader - I’m a world class athlete too!’Earlier this year, Vonn acknowledged to The New York Times that it was difficult for her to adjust to a relationship with such a high profile athlete. 'Some people seem to forget that I'm not just Tiger's girlfriend,' she said.

World class: Vonn is the best female Alpine skier in U.S. history

Big plans: Lindsey Vonn speaks at a news conference regarding the Sochi Olympics, the World Cup season and 2015 World Championships on Friday

Vonn is the best female Alpine skiier in U.S. history, and needs only four more World Cup wins to beat the world record of 62 World Cup wins, held by Sweden's Ingmar Stenmark.

'Lindsey is demanding to be considered an equal, but she thinks Tiger still sees her only as a pretty accessory and doesn’t take her skiing career seriously,' a source reportedly told the National Enquirer.

Vonn is scheduled to compete in the slalom on February 18 and the giant slalom on February 21.

The two events Woods is considering competing in that would mean he would miss Vonn's events are the AT&T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am, which he's playing once since 2002, and the Northern Trust Open, which he hasn't played since 2006.
