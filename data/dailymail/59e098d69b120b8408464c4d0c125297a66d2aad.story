A group of MPs believe the delay in publishing the Chilcot Inquiry report into the Iraq War is part of a plot by allies of Tony Blair

A powerful cross-party move to end the ‘intolerable’ delay in the publication of the Chilcot Inquiry report into the Iraq War is being mounted by MPs who suspect it is part of a plot by allies of Tony Blair.

The group of MPs, led by Tory David Davis and former Lib Dem Minister Norman Baker, are planning to table a Commons debate early in the New Year calling for Sir John Chilcot’s incendiary £10million report to be released before the General Election.

Intense behind-the-scenes arguments over many of the sensitive Government documents seen by Sir John – including letters written by Tony Blair to George W. Bush – have held up the report’s publication, with many of the key players arguing that they should remain classified. 

But Mr Blair’s critics suspect that the objections are a ‘blocking device’ designed to delay the report until after the May poll to limit the expected political damage to Labour.

The inquiry was established six years ago to provide the definitive verdict on the UK’s role in the 2003 war, covering critical questions over whether Mr Blair had legitimate grounds to go to war and the extent of post-conflict planning.

It is now more than three years since Sir John held his last hearings.  

Mr Baker, who has written to Sir John to demand that he publishes his report, said last night: ‘Unless I can get a clear assurance from Sir John Chilcot that he is able to get his report published before the Election, I and others intend to try to force a debate and vote in the Commons early in the New Year on this important matter.’ 

Mr Baker and Mr Davis, the former Conservative leadership contender, are also expected to approach Labour MPs to support the motion. 

Last week, it was revealed that draft extracts shown to the key individuals in advance had ‘sent shockwaves’ through Whitehall, with strenuous efforts being made by those concerned to tone down criticism.

One source said: ‘It’s much more punchy than people thought it was going to be.’

If the report is not released by the end of February, Election rules will prevent its publication until after polling on May 7. 

Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood has tried to tackle the delay over the Blair/Bush letters by ruling that the ‘gist’, and not the detail, of their correspondence should be published.
