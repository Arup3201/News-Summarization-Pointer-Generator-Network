Winter storms are set to bring travel chaos to almost 100 million as they attempt to make their way home for the Christmas break. 

More than 15 inches of snow is expected in Washington State over Christmas with heavy falls over the Rockies, Montana, Wyoming and Idaho. 

Further heavy snows are expected in states surrounding the Great Lakes, while heavy rains are believed to to be threatening an area surrounding the Mississippi Valley according to the National Weather Service.  

Snow is threatening an area from the West Coast through the Great Lakes to Maine on the East Coast

Some parts of Washington State are being threatened with up to 15 inches of snow

But meteorologist Amy Seeley said various computer models showed differing forecasts Monday and "aren't in agreement yet."

More than 90 per cent of some 98.6 million holiday travelers are expected to get to and from home by car during the next two weeks, while about six per cent are expected to fly, according to Julie Hall, spokeswoman for the AAA motor club.

AAA expects car travel to be up more than four per cent this year compared to 2013. Hall says that's at least partly due to lower gas prices.

The storm could cause similar disruption as Winter Coast Storm Cato in November, when more than 400,000 people spent Thanksgiving without power as a nor'easter caused chaos across the East Coast.

Snow fell in every state from Virginia to Maine as the storm hit its peak and forced the cancellation of more than 700 flights.

The coming storms - whose precise tracks remain uncertain - will be bad news for many of the 98million people expected to make significant Christmas journeys this year.

According to AP, an area of low pressure will shift across the central third of the country today, while a coastal system will develop over the southern Mid-Atlantic.

A low pressure system will move eastward over the northern Plains and the Midwest on Monday. 

According to the Weather Channel, the rain could spread over much of the eastern third of the U.S.

Christmas Day is expected to bring poor weather across Idaho, Colorado and Wyoming 

This system will usher widespread precipitation across the Plains, the Mississippi Valley, the Tennessee Valley and the upper Midwest. Snow showers will be mostly confined to the northern Plains, while a mixture of rain and snow will affect the central high Plains and the upper Midwest.

Light rain will spread across the southern Plains, the middle Mississippi Valley, the Tennessee Valley and the Ohio Valley.

In addition, a cold front associated with this system will extend west northwestward over the Intermountain West and the Pacific Northwest. Scattered light showers will persist over Oregon and Washington, while moderate to heavy snow showers will develop across the central and northern Rockies.

Snow accumulations could exceed one foot across favorable mountain slopes. A light mixture of rain and snow will also develop across the northern Great Basin.

Moderate snow showers also developed across the northern Plains, while a mixture of rain and snow affected the upper Midwest. Just south of the mixed precipitation, several clusters of showers formed over the middle Mississippi Valley and the Tennessee Valley. 

Meanwhile, a stationary front extended across the eastern Gulf Coast, the Southeast and the southern Mid-Atlantic. Rain and thunderstorms developed over the Deep South and the southern Mid-Atlantic, while a mixture of rain and freezing rain formed across the northern Mid-Atlantic. 

Flash flood watches were issued over the Florida Panhandle, the southeastern corner of Alabama and the southwestern corner of Georgia. Additionally, freezing rain advisories were issued in northern Virginia, Maryland, eastern West Virginia, southern Pennsylvania, northern New Jersey and southeast New York. Kill Devil Hills, North Dakota reported a midday total of 1.73 inches of rain. 

Daytona Beach, Florida reported a midday total of 1.52 inches of rain. The West Coast stayed mostly clear of precipitation on Monday due to a ridge of high pressure over the eastern Pacific. Temperatures in the Lower 48 states Monday have ranged from a morning low of 10 degrees at Mount Washington, New Hampshire, to a midday high of 87 degrees at Immokalee Regional Airport, Florida.
