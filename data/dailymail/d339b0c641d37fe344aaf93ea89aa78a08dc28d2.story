The mother of a Tory MP has become a world champion triathlete - at the age of 65.

Jane Leslie  was crowned champion in the women's 65 to 69-year-old category at the World Triathlon Grand Final in Edmonton, Canada.

The super-fit mother-of-two, who entered her first triathlon aged 45, completed a 1,500m swim, 40km cycle and 10km run in two hours 47 minutes and 21 seconds, putting her four minutes ahead of her closest rival.

She is the mother of Charlotte Leslie,
 Conservative MP for Bristol North West, who was dubbed 'the Baywatch MP' after she recreated a photograph which emerged of her as
 a young Tory in a red swimming costume.

shows the svelte student working as a lifeguard in Cornwall during her 
university summers.

Mrs Leslie was one of just two Britons to compete in the event. Compatriot Sandra Abrams finished in ninth place.

She said: 'I'm pretty pleased with the result, I'm glad it's all over but I'm so pleased with what I achieved.

'You have to qualify in your own country first to be able to go, so it's quite a big thing to qualify.

'All the different countries around the world compete against each other so it's a big ask and the standard is very high.

Mrs Leslie's incredible feat meant she was crowned champion in the women's 65-69-year-old category at the World Triathlon Grand Final in Edmonton, Canada

'I have trained very hard, I really wanted it.

'I think if anything, it shows that we are not a whole lot of old ladies in swimming caps, this is a serious sport.'

Mrs Leslie first took up swimming aged 39 to help a friend who was recovering from breast cancer.

She
 was quickly talent spotted by coach Eric Henderson, coach of the City 
of Bristol squad at the time, and began to train seriously.

She broke a British record for her age 
in 1,500m front crawl just a few years later, and soon began to learn 
how to run, and cycle from scratch.

At
 45, Mrs Leslie started to compete in biathlons - a 100m swim followed by a 
one-kilometre run - coming third in her age group three times at the 
British Biathlon Championships.

At
 the same time unqualified she decided to head back to college and 
undertook both her GCSEs and A Levels, before studying English at 
Bristol University, graduating in 2003.

She trains six days a week, and can often be out for hours at a time when she is preparing for a major championship.

Miss Leslie said of her mother: 'Not only does she get mistaken for me in the Constituency, leading to many awkward comedy moments, or my sister, she's got quite an inspirational back-story.

'It wouldn't be an exaggeration to say she inspired me to be in politics today, and without her, my energy and aggression as a youngster could have landed me in prison.

'She has also been an inspiration to many older women in getting a bit more active, be it walking the dog or taking up sport.

'She is passionate about inspiring both young and old, but particularly those over 40, to show that even if it isn't the lunacy of World Triathlon Championships, you can achieve things in later life, if you have missed out on life-chances earlier on.

'I'm really proud of her.'
