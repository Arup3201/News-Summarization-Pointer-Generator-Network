Liberty Ross, who is being awarded a multi-million pound settlement in her divorce from film director Rupert Sanders 

She was left devastated when her philandering husband was caught publicly cheating on her with Twilight starlet Kristen Stewart.

Now stunning model Liberty Ross has had the last laugh with a multi-million-pound divorce deal which hits her cheating ex where it hurts … in his wallet.

Ross, 35, was heartbroken when her director husband Rupert Sanders was photographed in an intimate embrace with 24-year-old Stewart in a Hollywood car park in 2012.

But in court papers filed in Los Angeles last week she proved revenge is a dish best served cold as it was revealed she will keep three of the couple’s four homes, earn £23,000 a month in spousal and child support and a percentage of some of his future film earnings.

The 31-page document filed in LA Superior Court – which cites the grounds for divorce as ‘irreconcilable differences’ – also awards Ross eight per cent of Sanders’ gross income exceeding £1 million a year, half his pension plan – and even half of his credit card reward points.

Vogue model Ross, who will remain in the couple’s £1.2 million Hollywood Hills home and gets ownership of two other properties in London’s Waterloo and Ladbroke Grove, will also receive half of Sanders’ ongoing earnings for Snow White And The Huntsman in which, ironically, she played Stewart’s mother Queen Eleanor. The film has earned more than £230 million at the box office.

Sanders, 43, who issued a grovelling apology to his ‘beautiful wife and heavenly children’ after being caught cheating, keeps just the couple’s Malibu home, a 1970 Volkswagen van and a 2002 Nissan Pathfinder.

The pair have agreed to joint custody of daughter Skylar, nine, and son Tennyson, seven, with Sanders agreeing to pay 75 per cent of their school and medical fees. Ross will receive £14,700 a month in spousal support until 2018 or her remarriage and £8,235 a month in child support.

Ross was represented by Laura Wasser, a lawyer dubbed a ‘pitbull’ in Hollywood, who secured a reported £150 million settlement for Maria Shriver when husband Arnold Schwarzenegger admitted fathering a child with their maid. She has represented a Who’s Who of stars, including Heidi Klum and Angelina Jolie.

Ross and Sanders, both British born, married in 2003. Ross had a thriving career as a model in London, appearing alongside Kate Moss in a 2002 Burberry campaign. She moved to Hollywood to support Sanders’ career. The divorce document puts his ‘gross wages’ at £88,000 a month and hers at ‘zero’.

The model was heartbroken when this picture surfaced of Mr Sanders pictured in an intimate embrace with Twilight star Kristen Stewart 

Sanders embarked on an affair with Stewart, the lead in Snow White And The Huntsman. Ross later revealed she learned of the affair 20 hours before paparazzi pictures of her husband embracing Stewart went public. The affair also led to the breakdown of Stewart’s relationship with Twilight co-star Robert Pattinson. Ross later told Vanity Fair the split was ‘horrible... I have no words to describe what we went through.

‘But, I think, for me, something has to completely die for there to be a rebirth. I visualised [being] this sort of Masai warrior. I was just going to stand very still and very strong.’

The model is dating Interscope record boss Jimmy Iovine, who has a fortune of about $1 billion, according to Forbes.

The affair also led to the breakdown of Miss Stewart's relationship to her Twilight co-star Robert Pattinson, pictured 

Top divorce lawyer Raoul Felder, who represented Larry Fortensky in his split from Elizabeth Taylor, said last night: ‘This is an extraordinary settlement. She has taken him to the cleaners. When I see this sort of settlement, it is usually because the husband has a high degree of personal guilt.

‘Maybe he just wants to do the right thing. He is a relatively young man and so he is probably confident of his future earning potential.’

Representatives for Ross and Sanders did not respond to requests for comment last night.
