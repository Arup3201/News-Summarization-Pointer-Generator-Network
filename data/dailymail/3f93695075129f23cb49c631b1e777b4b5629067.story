This heavyweight porker looks relieved as a team of firefighters hauled her baulky 900lb body out of a muddy pond.

The group, made up of professionals and volunteers, worked together to heave Strawberry the pig to safety after she stumbled into the water behind a house in South West Ranches near Fort Lauderdale, Florida.

The huge American Yorkshire swine is reported to have slipped into the five-foot deep water as its owner was preparing to take her to Wakulla in Florida.

Quick-thinking neighbours helped keep the two-and-a-half-year-old pig's head above water until help arrived.

Members of Pembroke Pines Fire Department and Southwest Ranches Volunteer Fire Department saved herb bacon as they dragged her from the murky water.

Strawberry could be forgiven for taking a dip in the cool water as temperatures in Florida have regularly topped 90C during a sizzling summer.

American Yorkshires are popular with breeders in the US because of their large size

After all, the chunky porker is not best suited to boiling weather.

As the name suggests, Yorkshires are
descended from British stock, called Large Whites, which originated in 
the northern English county.

The breed was exported across the world by British breeders in the 19th Century.

Yorkshires are favoured by pig breeders in the US and other countries because of their chunky build.

Florida is home to an estimated 500,000 feral pigs who live wild in the countryside.

The pig was rescued from a pond in the town of South Ranches, 15 miles from Fort Lauderdale, Florida (pictured)
