Liam Bridcutt is set to benefit from Lee Cattermole’s suspension and make his first Premier League start of the season against Everton on Sunday.

Cattermole will be sidelined for almost three weeks because of the international break after picking up a one-game ban following his fifth booking of the season during Monday’s 3-1 win at Crystal Palace.

Manager Gus Poyet, however, isn’t too concerned by the midfielder’s suspension.

‘Lee is Lee,’ he said. ‘It doesn’t bother me.

‘It was going to happen sooner or later, especially in a game like that. It was a difficult game for the ref with so many fouls and tackles because you’re competing.’

It is Bridcutt – creator of the third goal at Selhurst Park – who will deputise for Cattermole, rather than £10million Jack Rodwell.

The former Brighton anchorman – signed by Poyet for £4m in January – has struggled to impact at the Stadium of Light but could now win an extended run in the side.

‘Liam has been fine and is waiting,’ said Poyet.

'I’ve even been tempted every now and then to play them both (Cattermole and Bridcutt) together.’
