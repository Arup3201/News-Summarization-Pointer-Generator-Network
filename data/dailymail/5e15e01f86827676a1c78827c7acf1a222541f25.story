The national broadcaster has refused to apologise to one of Australia's highest profile military officers, Captain Cate McGregor, caught up in a public furore over anti-transgender tweets aimed at her during the popular Q&A program. 

Viewers have railed against the published comments, even calling for the moderator's sacking but the ABC insists the tweets were 'within guidelines'.

Posts included 'Wow she/he is a hero' and 'God sets our gender, we shouldn't interfere', angering many viewers of the current affairs panel discussion.

But an ABC spokesperson has told Daily Mail Australia that: 'Q&A’s on-screen tweets are selected through a multi-stage moderation process to provide an alternative layer around the studio discussion based on the commentary of viewers on Twitter'.

'The tweets are chosen to reflect the diverse range of opinions in the Q&A audience,' the ABC said. 'We believe the tweets you identify meet those guidelines and were appropriate for broadcast.'

One of the tweets which offended some viewers

One of the tweets considered most offensive originated from an account listed as Security Advisers, but it was quickly removed as the social media backlash mounted. 

Security Advisers is an independent group which claims to provide strategic advice to government agencies and corporate Australia, and the tweet was apparently sent by mistake.

While the Q & A earned praise for inviting a transgender panellist for the first time and seeking her view on how the community can make life easier for those who make a gender choice, the fallout from the reaction of those watching has continued.

This post from a corporate account of a security firm was quickly deleted

But there appears little chance of a public apology, as demanded by some viewers. There were even those calling for the sacking of those moderating the published tweets.

'The tweets are chosen to reflect the diverse range of opinions in the Q&A audience,' the ABC said.

'We believe the tweets you identify meet those guidelines and were appropriate for broadcast.'

Group Captain Cate McGregor is considered one of Australia's most influential women and has won great support for her performance on Q & A and for her reaction to the controversial tweets.

The public backlash also included viewers calling for the sacking of those moderating the published tweets

The backlash was immediate, with viewers calling the comments of others 'disrespectful and offensive'

'I was called a boy for a long time, I was called a lot worse actually too,' she said on Q&A.

The RAAF Group Captain was born Malcolm McGregor in 1956 in Toowoomba, in Northern Queensland. After much heartache and depression, the life-changing event to become a woman took place in 2012. 

'There may be some people who may have felt incredibly conflicted by that language, it didn't, I transitioned quite late in life and had functioned as a male for a darn long time and had far worse stuff said to me from first slip when I was batting at cricket.'

However, not all the social media comments to the program caused anger, there were those who applauded Q&A for inviting a transgender panellist for the first time

Cate McGregor is a close friend of Prime Minister Tony Abbott after first locking horns on the rugby field in the 1980s. As Malcolm McGregor she had worked for both sides of politics

Cate McGregor counts the Prime Minister among her friends, after they first locked horns on the rugby field more than 30 years ago and has worked for both sides of politics. 

'It's no bargain being trans, if you have lived with that level of conflict and difficulty, it's a tough decision. I admire immensely people who come out young and early. It wasn't a huge career enhancer or bargain for me to do it, it happened to me after a lot of agony.

'When you choose to express your gender then be treated with respect and appropriate pronouns and so on and I've largely had that.' 

Transphobia is not something the leading ADF official has encountered much of since making the decision to change.

She told Australian Story earlier this year, 'with very few exceptions most people are gracious'.

'It's almost too exquisite being alive, I really mean that, it's a wonderful feeling to be alive and be me.'
