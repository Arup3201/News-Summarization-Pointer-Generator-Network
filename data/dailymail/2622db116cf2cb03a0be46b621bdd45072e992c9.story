The angry mother of a victim of the Oxford sex grooming gang last night demanded: ‘Someone needs to take the blame.’

Catastrophic failings by police and social services enabled the sadistic group to drug, rape and traffic girls as young as 11 for eight years. Victims repeatedly told police they had been abused and sexually tortured and care-home staff just watched as the men collected the under-age girls at night.

But despite the catalogue of appalling blunders and missed opportunities – and David Cameron warning police and council chiefs they faced ‘very searching questions’ – nobody is  prepared to take the blame.

Oxfordshire County Council's chief executive Joanna Simons, left, and Thames Valley Police chief constable Sara Thornton, right, have both refused to resign despite their organisations' failure to stop the abuse sooner

Seven members of a paedophile ring were found guilty at the Old Bailey of a catalogue of child sex abuse charges

Both Thames  Valley Police Chief 
Constable Sara Thornton and Joanna Simons, head of Oxfordshire County 
Council, say they will not resign.

Their defiance, a day after the seven
 vicious and ‘medieval’ predators were convicted at the Old Bailey, came
 as:

Most of the eight-year campaign of 
abuse by the gang took place after Miss Thornton was appointed head of 
the Thames Valley force in 2007.

She yesterday apologised for not 
acting sooner, but when asked if she had considered resigning from her 
£160,000-a-year post, she said: ‘The focus has got to be moving forward.
 I think the focus for me is on driving improvements in the future.’

Five of the six girls were abused 
while in the care of Oxfordshire County Council’s social services 
department.

But Miss Simons also said she was not quitting her 
£182,000-a-year job as chief executive.

She said: ‘My gut feeling is that I am
 not going to resign because my determination is that we need to do all 
that we can to take action to stamp this out.

‘[We are] incredibly sorry that we 
weren’t able to stop this abuse any sooner . . . what we understand now 
is much more about the grooming process.

'We didn’t understand that going
 back seven or eight years ago.

‘All I can do is apologise if we didn’t listen enough, if we didn’t do enough.’

The mother of one of the victims, only
 14 when the gang began plying her with drink and drugs before 
exploiting her for sex, said: ‘Oxford Social Services has failed our 
children and someone has to pay for it.

‘They were supposed to be looking 
after my child, yet the social workers went home at night knowing that 
she was being abused and did nothing.

‘The police are talking about there 
being more victims, something like 50 more girls, who they want to come 
forward.

But how can they expect them to have the courage to come 
forward when these six girls have been failed so badly.’

Speaking in New York, the Prime 
Minister refused to defend the Chief Constable and county council chief,
 saying the authorities would have to ‘respond for themselves in terms 
of what happened’.

Mr Cameron, an Oxfordshire MP, said: 
‘It really is just appalling, absolutely appalling – it’s shocking what 
took place. Everyone’s going to have to ask some very searching 
questions about how this was allowed to continue for so long.’

Abuse was carried out at the Nanford Guest House in Oxford. Pictured is a room at the guest house

As with similar outrages in Rochdale 
and Rotherham, police officers, social workers and staff in residential 
homes knew or suspected that children were being used and sold for sex 
by large numbers of men.

But a catalogue of opportunities to stop the abuse were missed from as early as May 2005.

Two of the three care homes where victims of the Oxford gang lived have been closed down.

But only one person has been sacked – a
 manager at Dell Quay, a privately run care home in Henley-on-Thames 
where the council placed girls, was dismissed after refusing to pay a 
victim’s taxi fare when she returned after running away.

The 14-year-old was driven back to Oxford where she was raped.

Steve Heywood, assistant chief 
constable of Greater Manchester Police, said yesterday: ‘Our No 1 
priority at the moment is child sexual exploitation. It is now ahead of 
gun crime. Expect a lot more convictions.’

Prosecutors
 have pledged to 're-review' three historic cases involving victims of 
the Oxford sex ring after admitting more could have been done to 
investigate their claims.

The
 Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said it would look again at the 
decision to take no further action over the allegations of abuse 
involving the girls from 2005 to 2006.

In one case, the CPS said information was requested from Thames Valley Police but the force did not respond.

Baljit
 Ubhey, chief crown prosecutor for Thames and Chiltern, said the CPS 
would now be more 'proactive' when dealing with sex abuse allegations.

She said: 'We want to encourage people who have experienced something similar to have the courage to come forward.

'What
 we shouldn't do is as soon as we see a weakness - the girls had taken 
drugs or alcohol or they lied about something in the past - that means, 
"this case is hopeless and we can't go ahead with it".

'Rather
 than be fatalistic and negative, it's about being really positive and 
saying, "how can we really get to the truth here?"'

Ms Ubhey admitted the CPS should have pursued Thames Valley Police when information was first requested about one of the claims.

The further allegations do not involve any of the defendants involved in the Old Bailey trial, she added.

'I think we could have been more proactive,' Ms Ubhey said.

'Of four cases we looked at, in three of those it's arguable we might have been able to do more.

'What
 I can't say is that we will change our decision. What I can say is 
perhaps we could have taken a more proactive approach in making further 
enquiries.'

Ms Ubhey confirmed a serious case review would be conducted following the conclusion of the trial.She
 said she expected more cases of a similar nature to come to light as 
new guidance is issued by the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) in 
the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal.

Ms
 Ubhey added: 'I think what these cases have highlighted is that they're
 probably not isolated incidents and there's probably more of this 
activity going on.'
