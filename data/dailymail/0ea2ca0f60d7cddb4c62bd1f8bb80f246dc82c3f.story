Robert Lewandowski got off the mark for Bayern Munich after netting in his first appearance for the club since his move from Borussia Dortmund.

The Polish striker scored just after the hour in their 1-1 friendly draw against third-tier German side MSV Duisberg.

David Alaba and Rafinha also appeared, and Holger Badstuber started as he continues his recovery from long-term injury, but it was otherwise a very youthful-looking side put out by Pep Guardiola, with many of his stars still on holiday following Germany's World Cup triumph.

Off the mark: Robert Lewandowski scored in his first pre-season appearance for Bayern Munich

Debut: The forward joined from rivals Borussia Dortmund on a free transfer over the summer

Looking pleased: Pep Guardiola will be happy that his latest acquisition got off to a good start

Bayern stars Manuel Neuer, Philip Lahm, Bastian Schweinsteiger, Jerome Boateng and Thomas Muller all started the final against Argentina - as did Real Madrid-bound midfielder Toni Kroos - whilst Mario Gotze came off the bench to score the all-important winner.

So it is Lewandowski who will be the centre of attention for the next couple of weeks as Guardiola and Bayern prepare for the upcoming season ahead.

And the forward will be glad he's off to such a good start, as he looks to replace the recently departed Mario Mandzukic, following his free transfer switch from Dortmund.
