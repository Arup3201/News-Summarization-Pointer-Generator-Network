Europe sealed a third consecutive Ryder Cup win on Sunday, turning a comfortable lead into a convincing victory by shading the singles matches.

But how did the two sides match up across the three days? Sportsmail's Derek Lawrenson rates the twenty-four players. 

Europe:

Thomas Bjorn — P3 W0 L2 H1

First Cup for 12 years; he came up against some inspired play from his opponents. 5 

Jamie Donaldson — P4 W3 L1

Does it get much better than partnering Lee Westwood and clinching the winning point? 9

Donaldson enjoyed the perfect Ryder Cup debut, picking up three points, including the winning one

Victor Dubisson — P3 W2 L0 H1

Can you imagine the Frenchman’s status by the time the Cup is played in his country in 2018? 8 

Stephen Gallacher — P2 W0 L2 

Unluckily paired with Ian Poulter in opening fourballs during a rare off-day for Englishman. 5 

Sergio Garcia — P4 W2 L1 H1 

Great to see the Spaniard so happy off the course and playing with such fire and passion. 7 

Martin Kaymer — P4 W1 L1 H2 

Found team aspect tricky early on but showed class of a US Open champion yesterday. 6 

Graeme McDowell — P3 W3 L0 

Should have played four matches. Inspired with Dubuisson and indomitable in the singles. 8 

Sergio Garcia (right) looked happy both on and off the course as Europe's big men performed

Debutant Victor Dubuisson formed a superb partnership with Graeme McDowell on Friday and Saturday

McDowell's comeback on Sunday turned the tide for Europe and was a crucial part of their victory

Rory McIlroy — P5 W2 L1 H2 

Showed how much he cared over first two days and then why he is world’s best on Sunday. 8

Ian Poulter — P3 W0 L1 H2 

Curiously peripheral, apart from a couple of great shots. Hope we haven’t seen best of him. 5 

Rory McIlroy showed on Sunday why he is the best, and the passion shone through all weekend

Poulter made one superb shot, but wasn't at his best at a competition that usually brings out his best

Justin Rose — P5 W3 L0 H2 

Hard to imagine what more he could do. Dug deep when he had to and some play was inspired. 9

Henrik Stenson — P4 W3 L1 

Cruel he lost singles by missing a four-foot putt. But a fantastic partnership with Rose. 7 

Lee Westwood — P4 W2 L2 

A fine job instilling belief in Jamie Donaldson and wonderful he passed Seve’s points total. 7 

Justin Rose was Europe's best player, winning four points over the three days and inspiring his team

Captain: Paul McGinley

His only error was pairing Gallacher with Poulter. Every bit the superb captain we had hoped for. 9

United States

Keegan Bradley — P3 W1 L2 

Didn’t unpack his suitcase after Medinah and might need to buy another after this. 4 

Rickie Fowler — P5 W0 L3 H2 

Unlucky to run into Rory in three of his matches and clearly overplayed by Watson. 5 

Jim Furyk — P4 W1 L3 

Ninth Ryder Cup and seven defeats. Hasn’t won a singles for 10 years. He’s just not up to it. 4 

Jim Furyk lost three of his four matches as his dismal Ryder Cup record only got worse

Zach Johnson — P3 W0 L2 H1 

Like Poulter a rock at previous Ryder Cups and like him stuck on the sidelines this time. 4 

Matt Kuchar — P4 W1 L3 

Actually played well but terribly unlucky to run into three hot European partnerships. 6 

Hunter Mahan — P4 W1 L2 H1 

Showed a lot of heart in team aspect but then came another terrible chip yesterday. 6 

Phil Mickelson — P3 W2 L1 

Stupid of Watson to bench him for foursomes on Saturday. Good singles win against local hero. 6 

Patrick Reed — P4 W2 L0 H2 

Brilliant Cup debut. Joint best American on view with Walker and a man to build team around. 8

Patrick Reed was a rare bright spot for a USA team that was constantly outplayed by Europe

Reed is congratulated by vice captain Andy North and the young American finished unbeaten in four matches

Webb Simpson — P2 W0 L1 H1 

Hard to see why he was ever chosen as a wildcard. Just not got enough game at this level. 4 

Jordan Spieth — P4 W2 L1 H1 

Great partnership with Reed that we will see in future but defeat by McDowell will hurt. 7 

Jordan Spieth lost his singles match but his partnership with Reed was excellent throughout

Jimmy Walker — P5 W1 L1 H3 

Surprise package in US team. Quiet and undemonstrative but showed he is a real player. 8 

Bubba Watson — P3 W0 L3 

Great fun on the first tee but that was the extent of his impact. Hopeless on Sunday. 5

Captain: Tom Watson

This was a Ryder Cup way too far for the great man. Out of touch and it showed. 4

American captain Tom Watson had no answer to Europe and this may have been a Ryder Cup too far
