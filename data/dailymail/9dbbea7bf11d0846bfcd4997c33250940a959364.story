An elderly woman suffering from dementia made the heartbreaking decision to take her own life before the crippling disease did.

Gillian Bennett, born in Christchurch, New Zealand, but who lived in Bowen Island, in British Columbia in Canada with her husband Jonathan Bennett, penned a heartbreaking letter explaining her decision before her death last week.

'I will take my life today around noon. It is time. Dementia is taking its toll and I have nearly lost myself. I have nearly lost me. Jonathan, the straightest and brightest of men, will be at my side as a loving witness,' the letter began.

The touching piece which spanned almost 2000 words, described in detail the crippling and deteriorative toll that dementia had already had on Mrs Bennett's life. The woman also made a passionate case for one's right to end their own life.

The 85-year-old great-grandmother is survived by her husband, their two children, six grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.

In the letter she detailed the impact her suffering would inevitably have on her family and friends, but also the healthcare system in Canada.

'Understand that I am giving up nothing that I want by committing suicide. All I lose is an indefinite number of years of being a vegetable in a hospital setting, eating up the country's money but having not the faintest idea of who I am,' Mrs Bennett wrote.

The couple had been married nearly six decades but it was illegal for Jonathan  to assist his wife, so he simply stayed by her side as she slipped away 

Speaking to the NZ Herald on Wednesday, Gillian's loving husband told of the moment his wife slipped away from him, laying on a mattress at the back of their Bowen Island home in one of her favourite spots.

'It happened amazingly quickly. After about half an hour her eyes were open but I couldn't see her, her chest was not moving. It looked like she was gone. I waited another half hour and then I called our doctor and then the police were called,' Mr Bennett told the publication.

He also revealed the difficulty he faced in not being able to assist her, as it is illegal to do so in Canada and many other parts of the world. Mr Bennett said he took comfort in the fact he could be by his wife of almost six decades' side.

'I knew all along what she was going to do, and that is legal. She was extremely anxious not to get anyone in any legal or criminal trouble', he said, 

In the letter Mrs Bennett opened up about her internal battle with the disease, and the feeling of each day losing parts of herself heading towards an inevitable end of not knowing who she was anymore.

'I know as I write these words that within six months or nine months or twelve months, I, Gillian, will no longer be here. What is to be done with my carcass? It will be physically alive but there will be no one inside,' Mrs Bennett wrote.

She passed away at the back of her home overlooking one of her favourite spots, and Mrs Bennett's letter has reignited the debate about the right to die with dignity

The moving piece ended with a peaceful sentiment, and an urge for people to reconsider the laws which surround assisted deaths.

'Today, now, I go cheerfully and so thankfully into that good night. Jonathan, the courageous, the faithful, the true and the gentle, surrounds me with company. I need no more.'

Since its publication last week, the letter has opened up widespread debate about whether the world needs to reconsider its tough constraints on people assisting their loved ones to make the decision to end their own lives pass away in peace.
