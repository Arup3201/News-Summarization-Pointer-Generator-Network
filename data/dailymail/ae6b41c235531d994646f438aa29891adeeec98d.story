Calum Chambers had no qualms about dropping down to the England Under 21s squad, saying it is an honour to represent his country whatever the level.

Having impressed with Southampton last season, the 20-year-old made a big-money move to Arsenal in the summer and quickly earned a first call-up from Roy Hodgson.

It saw Chambers' jump from the Under 19s without make a single appearance for the Under-21s - a level he now finds himself at after winning three caps for the senior team.

The defender made his Young Lions debut as Gareth Southgate's side won 1-0 win in the Czech Republic on Friday and insists, unlike some players, he has no problem with dropping down from the senior squad.

'As I've always said, it's an honour to play for your country, no matter what the age group,' Chambers said

'When I was asked to play for the U21s, of course I was going to come and play.

'I was really looking forward to this trip and I've enjoyed every minute of it so far.

'There is a smooth pathway between the U21s and the seniors now and there was an opportunity for me to play for the U21s so I jumped at it because I love to play for my country.

'Players should want to play for their country at any level and I've played for the senior team a few times, but that would never make me want to stop playing for the U21s. It's an honour and you should never turn it down.

'The lads here are great and there is a brilliant atmosphere in the squad. It has been a really enjoyable trip so far.'

Chambers is one of several players with senior international experience that could be on the plane to the Czech Republic this summer.

Friday's match offered the squad a taste of what they can expect at the European Championships, for which they continue their preparations with a friendly against Germany on Monday.

'I enjoyed it,' Chambers said of his debut. 'We knew it was going to be a tough game, playing at their home ground and in front of their home crowd.

'But in the end it was a good result and a good performance.

'Everyone here gives 100 per cent in every game and there is good competition for places which will only make us stronger as a squad.'
