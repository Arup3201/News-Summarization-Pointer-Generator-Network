Is it possible to get a group of 15 three to five-year-olds, who have never played the piano before, together on a concert stage to perform a piece of classical music in just five weeks?

Swedish insurance company Folksam attempted just that for a recent commercial project entitled ‘Mini Maestros’ and the results – although containing a couple of expected errors – are outstanding.

In the clip the conductor is shown at work leading an orchestra, before entering the room full of children from a preschool in Klara, Stockholm and uttering: ‘Oh dear’ at the sight of the youngsters running around.

The conductor is featured taking the children to the piano in turn and teaching them how to play a few notes

The 15 pianos, each featuring a photograph of a child, are assembled in a circle on the concert stage

Settling them down, he takes them one-by-one to the piano and begins the difficult task of teaching them how to play a few notes.

Teasing out a piece of the final performance, the development of the children is briefly showcased alongside the conductor stating: ‘Sometimes you don’t know what makes the penny drop.’

The stage is set, the conductor gets dressed and the pianos are fitted with photographs of the children who will momentarily play them.

Climbing up onto their stools, the children are silenced by the conductor’s baton and the performance gets under way.

The children stop talking and wait in anticipation to begin playing after the conductor raps his baton off of a music stand

Concentrating, the children hunch over their pianos and each play their individual bits with their index fingers

Each concentrating on their own individual part, the children – hunched over their pianos in anticipation – use their index fingers to press the keys and together play the beginning of Erik Satie’s Gymnopédie No. 1.

A few bum notes feature in the piece, but they fit wonderfully alongside the imagery of teddy bears accompanying the children at the pianos and feet swinging from stools miles from the ground.

As the performance ends, the conductor and the children congratulate each other and the credits begin to roll.

Despite hitting a few bum notes the children, who have only played the piano for 15 weeks, perform outstandingly well
