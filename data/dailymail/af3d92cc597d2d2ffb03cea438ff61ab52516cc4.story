Sony's highly-anticipated PlayStation 4 finally launches in the UK on Friday, with stores across the country opening at midnight tomorrow.

Yet keen gamers have already started queuing outside the PS4 lounge in Covent Garden, London to make sure they don't miss out and some have been queuing since Monday.

Armed with blankets, sleeping bags and tents, PlayStation superfans are bedding down to spend the the next 24 hours in almost freezing temperatures to be first in line.

Sony's PlayStation 4 has been praised for being cheaper than Microsoft's Xbox One console - the PS4 goes on sale for £349 in the UK and $399 in the U.S, while the Xbox One costs £429 and $499.

However, Sony is selling its console at a loss according to figures from analytics firm IHS.

The Colorado-based company found that the bill of materials (BOM) for the PS4 equates to $372, plus manufacturing costs taking it up $381.

This is $18 less than the retail price.

Although Microsoft saw similar queues ahead of its Xbox One launch last week, even the most die-hard fans didn't arrive until around 7am on the morning of the launch.

The PS4 Lounge in Covent Garden opened two weeks ago to coincide with the console going on sale in the U.S.

It was opened so fans could play PS4 games ahead of their official release Friday. 

Prices for the PS4 start at £349 - around £80 cheaper than the Xbox One, but some retailers have already sold out of pre-orders and others are warning they may not get new stock in time for Christmas.

Asda announced today it has got extra stocks of the console and 155 stores will be selling the machines from midnight Thursday.

The PS4's launch line-up features 22 games including military shooters, sports simulations and family-friendly adventures.

It also offers media apps, including Hulu and Netflix, with the aim of enticing non-gamers to splash out on the console.

The slimline machine has a new user interface that lets gamers connect with other users and download games and films from the PlayStation Store.

Sony says the console has ten times the processing power of the PS3 and offers a screen resolution of up to 1080p.

It claims the console's faster frame rates will mean environments in games, TV shows and films will be more detailed, lighting will look more realistic and animations will be smoother.

However, only time will tell if the PlayStation 4 will be as big a hit as Microsoft’s Xbox One.

More than one million Xbox One consoles were sold throughout the world in the first 24 hours, according to Microsoft, which surpasses first-day sales of the Xbox 360 - the previous-generation model.

The new console was launched in 13 countries at midnight on 22 November and the software giant said it sold out almost immediately at most retailers.

Microsoft statisticians estimated that in the first day of game play, fans killed more than 60 million zombies in Dead Rising 3 and drove more than 3.6 million miles on Forza Motorsport 5.

Sony’s Playstation 4 was released in the U.S and Canada on Friday 15 and also sold 1million units in the first 24 hours .

It was the first major console release for the Japanese company since 2006.

Analytic firm IHS predicted earlier this year that Sony's PlayStation 4 would outsell Microsoft's Xbox One and be the most popular console among gamers buy the end of next year.

However, John Lewis disagrees and predicted last week that Microsoft's console will outsell Sony's despite being more expensive.

John Lewis gaming buyer Robert Hennessey said: 'With exclusive titles, a strong multimedia offering, plus a thoroughly re-worked Kinect motion control system, the Xbox One appears to be ahead of the game this Christmas.
