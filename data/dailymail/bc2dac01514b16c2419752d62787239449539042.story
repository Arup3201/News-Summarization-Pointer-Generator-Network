A previously unseen letter showing the softer side of the famously stoic captain of the Titanic has emerged.

Captain Edward Smith has passed into legend for going down with his ship shouting 'Be British' as the luxurious liner sank on April 15, 1912.

But a touching letter he sent to his daughter has shown an altogether different side to the captain, who was known for both his discipline and toughness.

Softer side: Captain Smith on RMS Baltic - a few years before his transfer to the doomed Titanic

The letter was sent home to his daughter while Captain Smith was serving as the head of another ship before he took charge of the Titanic for her maiden voyage.

In the letter Captain Smith draws a picture of a little bird and apologises for not being able to send a bunny to his young daughter Helen.

The letter reads: 'My dear Daughter, I could not catch a little bunny to send you in my letter so send you a card by this little bird. I hope Mother and you and Gladys are well. I shall soon be home. Your loving Daddy.'

Smith joined White Star Line as a fourth officer on the SS Celtic in 1880.

He worked his way up through the ranks to become one of the top ship commanders for the company.

He wrote the letter to eight-year-old Helen while serving as the captain of the RMS Baltic on November 29, 1906.

The letter is being auctioned by Henry Aldridge and Son of Devizes, Wiltshire, later this month.

A photograph of his grown-up daughter Helen at the unveiling of a statue of her father in Lichfield, Staffordshire, will be auctioned alongside the letter.

A copy of a newspaper article from April 1912, featuring an interview with Captain Smith's widow Eleaonor will also feature in the auction.

Andrew Aldridge, of the auctioneers, said: 'Captain Smith was well known for his bravery and for going down with the ship.

'He was a tough and hard man, one who was incredibly disciplined by all accounts.

Loving: The letter, which is signed 'Daddy', is expected to sell for £10,000 at the auction

'But this letter to his daughter shows a different side to this man, who has been immortalised in various books, films and television productions, altogether.

'The way he addresses his daughter, talking about things like bunnies and sketching a bird for her, shows a completely different side to him.

'It shows us a loving and caring side to him and offers a window into his soul.'

The letter is expected to sell for £10,000 at the auction on April 20.
