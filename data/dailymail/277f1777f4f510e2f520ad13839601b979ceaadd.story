Supporters somehow escaped major harm in frightening scenes as a rally car flipped during a race in Italy.

Up to nine fans – who were sat watching the Jolly Rally Valle D'Aosta in North West Italy from a wall on a bend – dived for cover as the Renault Clio Super 1600 astonishingly flew towards them.

Both the driver Pietro Scavone and his navigator Diego D’Herin came away from the crash unscathed. They were released from hospital after precautionary tests. 

 The Renault Clio, driven by Pietro Sacvone, drove round the corner at high speed during the Jolly Rally Valle d'Aosta in northern Italy

The spectators realised there was a problem as the car misjudged the corner and mounted a grass verge, hurtling towards them at pace

The Renault Clio then hit a dip in the grass, catapulting on to its roof, with spectators having not had time to move back from the roadside

As the rally car lands on its roof, before flipping back over, it seems that there is no way the spectators will be able to avoid injury

 The driver of the car, Pietro Sacvone, is helpless as his car flips upside down, and heads dangerously towards innocent bystanders

Miraculously, the car bounces back towards the road, missing the spectators by inches, and nobody is hurt in the crash

One spectator was said to have been taken to hospital with shock, while the race itself was stopped immediately on the same day as Formula One's Jules Bianchi was fighting for his life after the Japanese Grand Prix. 

‘The pilot and co-pilot are well, we have heard a little while ago,’ said race organiser Maurizio Salice.

Scavone appeared to take a corner too quickly on the first afternoon of a three-day event and lost control just 800ft from the end of the track in the Aosta Valley – one hour north of Turin.

The vehicle was captured encroaching on a grass verge, a vantage point of choice for a number of fans.

They had to take swift decisive action, but the fact that nobody on the wall was injured remains fortuitous in the extreme.

One woman can be seen attempting to shield herself from the flying debris as the car tumbled back into the middle of the track.

Thankfully, the car missed all spectators, and even the driver and his navigator were unharmed, despite how the car looked after the crash
