A taxi driver who killed a talented teenager while acting like he ‘owned the road’ as he carried out an aggressive overtaking manoeuvre already had a string of previous motoring convictions for dangerous driving, a court heard.

Sarah Jane Burke, 17, suffered catastrophic injuries when she was struck by David Baillie’s Volvo as she crossed the road on her way home from college in Sunderland, Tyne and Wear on September 17 last year.

The talented teenager, who was excelling on an art and design course at Sunderland College, suffered multiple fractures and brain trauma after she was thrown into the air before landing on her head 20 metres away.

She died from her injuries five days later, leaving behind her parents and sister who are devastated by her death.

Taxi driver Baillie, 39, who was off-duty when he hit Miss Burke, denied causing her death by dangerous driving but was found guilty by a jury after just over an hour of deliberations at Newcastle Crown Court.

After the unanimous guilty verdict was returned, Baillie’s string of previous motoring convictions - which include two for dangerous driving - were revealed in court.

Prosecutor Nick Dry said: ‘He has around ten for theft of motor vehicles and taking without consent, five for driving while disqualified and five for having no insurance.’

The court heard how Baillie has even served time in prison in the past for his poor driving.

Miss Burke’s devastated mother and father attended court for the entirety of the trial, and are expected to return tomorrow to see Baillie – who has been remanded in custody – sentenced.

Judge Paul Sloan QC warned him: ‘You must understand, a substantial sentence of imprisonment is inevitable in the circumstances of this case.’

Prosecutors said Baillie was ‘consumed by a determination to overtake at all costs’ when he ploughed into the teenager.

Miss Burke had been crossing the road on her way home from college when she was hit by Baillie, who had a woman and small child with him in the car, as he tried to dangerously overtake a Vauxhall Corsa.

Witnesses claimed Baillie had been ‘tailgating’ the other vehicle and had hit the popular teenager in his desperate effort to get in front.

One motorist said he thought Baillie was a ‘road rage’ driver while another said he thought Baillie’s Volvo must be either stolen or being chased.

Another witness said: ‘It was as if the driver owned the road and no-one else was there.’

Baillie, of Sunderland, had pleaded guilty to causing death by careless driving but denied his behaviour was dangerous.

Jurors were shown footage which was picked up by a passing bus and showed Miss Burke making her way home along the city’s Ormonde Street.

A second set of footage, picked up by a camera on another bus, showed the aftermath of the tragedy which included the teenager lying on the road injured after being knocked down.

Mr Dry told the court: ‘Witnesses watched in horror as she was struck and thrown into the air before coming to the ground, head-first.

‘Paramedics were on the scene within minutes and did what they could to stabilise Sarah Burke, who had clearly suffered multiple fractures and serious head injury.

‘She was taken to the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle by air ambulance. Sadly, she died of her injuries five days later.’

The court heard how Baillie initially blamed the Corsa driver for causing the crash but went on to admit in a police interview that his driving had been dangerous as he had been paying more attention to the other motorist than to the road ahead.

Mr Dry said: ‘He conceded his driving was dangerous, particularly the action to overtake on a busy, 30mph street with blind junctions, approaching traffic lights at a time when he was not focused on the road ahead.’

However, Mr Dry said that after Miss Burke died, Baillie ‘changed his mind’ and instead started to claim his driving was careless not dangerous.

Mr Dry added: ‘We have a defendant driving dangerously from the traffic lights at Barnes Park Road until the point of impact with Sarah Burke.

‘Driving fuelled by rage and failing to get ahead of the Corsa, therefore consumed by a determination to overtake at all costs, culminating in the collision which cost a 17-year-old girl her life.’
