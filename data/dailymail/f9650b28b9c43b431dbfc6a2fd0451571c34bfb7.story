An angry mother attacked bar staff with her stiletto heels and handbag after she was 'caught having a drunken romp' in a nightclub.

Angelina Lloyd, 38, was so furious at having her tryst with a mystery man interrupted, she took out her false teeth and went on a rampage.

Lloyd, who works as a baker, unleashed a torrent of abuse at staff before hurling one of her high-heeled shoes at doorman Alex Jenkins, hitting him on the head.

Angelina Lloyd has admitted assaulting bar and door staff after they challenged her over claims of sexual activity with a man in a nightclub

She then punched a barmaid before swinging her handbag at a female bouncer and jabbing her in the chest. She fled the SugarHouse in Colne, Lancashire but was arrested when she returned home.

Details of the brawl emerged at Burnley Magistrates Court where Lloyd, from Colne, admitted three counts of assault by beating and was fined £65 and ordered to pay £105 costs.

Dominic Howe, prosecuting, told the court the incident occurred on July 25 after Lloyd was seen by fellow clubbers 'engaging in sexual activity with a male' in the nightclub and both were asked to leave.

Mr Howe said the man was leaving the nightspot, but Lloyd took exception to being ejected and became abusive.

He told the court: 'She swung her handbag at a club worker and punched her in the chest. Lloyd continued to be abusive, approached a bar lady and punched her in the forehead.

'The defendant then hit Alex Jenkins with one of her stiletto shoes.'

He added: 'She threw both of her stilettos at him. One missed, the other hit him on the head. Fortunately, nobody was injured.'

The court heard Lloyd had a previous conviction for being drunk and disorderly, but her defence solicitor claimed the attack was an isolated incident and she had shown remorse.

Daniel Frazer, defending, said: 'Passions had been running high at the time, but when she had time to calm down she had thought long and hard and acknowledged her behaviour was unacceptable.

'She says she was doing nothing untoward with this gentleman. It was misconstrued. She was remonstrating and asking why she was being ejected from the club.'

The solicitor said that, during the altercation, bakery worker Lloyd says she was pushed by a staff member, causing her to fall to the floor and she reacted by throwing her shoes at him.

Mr Frazer said: 'She apologises to all three people who have been subjected to this incident. The defendant has no previous convictions for violence.'

Lloyd was unavailable for comment after the hearing.
