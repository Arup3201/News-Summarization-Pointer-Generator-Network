England striker Wayne Rooney and Spain midfielder Juan Mata were eliminated in the group stages, while Ashley Cole didn't even make it to Brazil - yet the trio were all smiling in Denver on Saturday.

Manchester United's attacking pair and Roma's new recruit were able to share a laugh and a joke despite their collective World Cup woes.

Cole signed for a Roma on a free transfer from Chelsea during the summer but he was reunited with ex-England team-mate Rooney and former Chelsea pal Mata in Denver.

Opener: Rooney opened the scoring for United with a sublime strike from 25 yards in Denver

It takes two: Rooney is dispossesed by two Roma players in the first-half at Mile High

Sublime: Mata took the ball down from Rooney and lobbed over Roma goalkeeper Lukasz Skorupski

United triumphed 3-2 over Cole's Roma in an entertaining match which was most memorable for Miralem Pjanic's 60-yard wonder strike for the Italian side.

Rooney and Mata were the stars of the show, however, with the England forward bagging a brace and an assist while the Spanish playmaker also scored.

Louis van Gaal has now won two straight matches as United boss as the Red Devils continue their tour of the US.
