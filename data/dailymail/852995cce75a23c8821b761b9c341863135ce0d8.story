British phone fans eagerly awaiting Samsung's eight-core Galaxy S4 will be disappointed after it emerged the UK version will ship with a downgraded processor.

The latest version of the South Korean company's flagship smartphone will arrive on these shores with a only quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 600 CPU, the Samsung has admitted.

Other markets will benefit from an 1.6GHz Exynos 5 octa-core processor, which is the thought to be the most powerful chip yet squeezed into a mobile phone.

Crippled: The Galaxy S4 seen at the unveiling event in New York. It is emerged that the UK version of Samsung's flagship phone will ship with a four-core chip, rather than the eight-core chip expected

Samsung had previously said the S4's chip would vary between markets, but it was understood the UK would be one of those where the eight-core processor would be available.

A Samsung spokesman told Trusted Reviews: 'Samsung Galaxy S 4 is equipped with a 1.9GHz Quad-core AP or a 1.6GHz Octa-core AP. The selection of AP varies by markets.'

The spokesman added that 'in the UK the Galaxy S4 will be available as a 4G device with a 1.9GHz Quad Core Processor.'

It is as yet unclear why Samsung has chosen to downgrade the processor for British consumers, although 3G speculated that it could be because the Exynos 5 is incompatible with 4G networks.

Other markets where the S4 is expected to ship with the Qualcomm chip include the U.S., Canada and Sweden.

However, while some Samsung fans will be disappointed with the firm's decision, speed benchmark tests have shown that even with the Snapdragon chip the S4 will be twice as fast as the iPhone 5, TechDigest reported.

The main concern expressed so far over the drop to four cores is that the downgraded phone is likely to have less battery life than its eight core sibling.

The Exynos chip, which contains four high-powered cores and four slower cores, is thought to be able to pass over less-intensive tasks to less power hungry sections of the chip - a trick processor developer ARM calls big.LITTLE.

The feature-packed S4, with its always-on cameras tracking users' eye movements and the like, is expected to be exceptionally tough on battery life.

It is possible that the UK's S4 will be upgraded to an eight-core model later, but Samsung has as yet said nothing to indicate that might be the case.
