A property developer who strangled his solicitor girlfriend hours after she had breast cancer surgery had previously throttled his ex-wife.

John Doyle, 54, was jailed for life yesterday for killing partner Sian Rees in a drunken rage when she ended their relationship.

He was caught after he put her dead body in the passenger seat of his van and crashed while driving to an unknown location to dispose of the corpse.

History of violence: John Doyle, 54, was today found guilty of killing his partner Sian Rees, 50, in June last year. Following the verdict it was revealed he had been convicted of a similar attack on his estranged wife in 1989

Yesterday it emerged that Doyle had been accused of trying to throttle his ex-wife more than 20 years ago.

The jury which convicted him of the 
‘brutal’ murder was not told of the previous case, which was also said 
to be motivated by jealousy. Doyle, who killed Miss Rees in June last 
year, was jailed for life with a minimum term of 16 years.

The couple had argued after Miss Rees 
was forced to drive them home from hospital, even though she had had an 
operation for breast cancer, because Doyle was drunk.

Investigation: Police survey the scene in Hatherleigh, Devon where the strangled body of Sian Rees was found dead last year

After the 1989 attack, John Doyle's estranged wife Gina gave police a vivid description of her ordeal.

She
said: 'He grabbed me around the throat and started squeezing and I 
managed to say "don't kill me". I kicked at John and got him in the 
stomach.

'I was on my last 
breath and thought I was going to pass out when he let me go and went. 
He held my throat fairly hard and at one point I thought he was going to
kill me.'

Doyle's stepdaughter Michelle said in a statement: 'I heard Mum screaming "help, help, he's going to kill me".

'Mum
was on the bed with Dad standing over her with his hands around her 
throat, trying to choke her. She kicked him in the stomach and he ran 
off.

Doyle was arrested soon afterwards and told police: 'I grabbed Gina around the throat. Yes, I admit I was angry.'

He
insisted he hit her five times, as opposed to the 20 blows on the face 
or body which she reported, but accepted he was responsible for her 
injuries, which included a black eye.

Doyle admitted causing his ex-wife actual bodily harm and was punished with community service.

The
judge told him: 'You forced entry to the granny flat and attacked a man
and a woman there. You punched your wife repeatedly about the head and 
body and she says you were choking her.'

After she told him their 14-year 
relationship was over, Doyle stabbed her and then strangled her with a 
bra, which was found in the van.

He left her body lying in their kitchen between the butcher’s block and a Rayburn cooker.

The next day he put her corpse in his 
van and drove a short distance from their home, near Hatherleigh in 
Devon, before crashing into a traffic island, puncturing a tyre.

He was desperate not to stop but 
eventually lost control and crashed into a hedge, attracting help from 
passers-by – one of whom was a nurse who realised Miss Rees was dead.

Judge Graham Cottle described Doyle’s claim he was acting in self-defence as ‘preposterous’.

He said: ‘I have no doubt you stabbed 
her. You intended to cause her death with that knife but in fact it did 
not strike any vital organs. Thereafter you strangled her to death.’

The jury at Exeter Crown Court was told the couple rowed about Doyle’s lack of progress on renovations to their home.

He was also jealous of an aeroplane flying dentist Miss Rees was speaking to online.

The jury was not told of Doyle’s 
attempt to strangle his first wife Gina 23 years ago at her home in 
Wanneroo, Western Australia.

On New Year’s Day 1989 he broke into 
her flat, attacked her boyfriend and punched her 20 times in the face 
before starting to throttle her.

He fled after the attack was interrupted by his stepdaughter Michelle and a teenage babysitter staying at the house.

Gina Doyle told police at the time: ‘He held my throat fairly hard and at one point I thought he was going to kill me.’

Doyle admitted causing his ex-wife actual bodily harm and was given community service.

Miss Rees died of heart failure induced by asphyxia and pressure on her carotid artery. She also had 40 other injuries.

A statement from her friends said: 
‘Sian was a loving, compassionate, generous, clever and funny friend and
colleague whose untimely death leaves a huge gap in the lives of those 
who knew her.’
