Former world heavyweight champion David Haye wants to return to the ring, according to his trainer Adam Booth.

The 33-year-old was forced to abort his last attempted comeback against Tyson Fury after rupturing tendons in his shoulder - announcing his retirement in November 2013 after being advised not to continue by doctors.

However, the self-styled 'Hayemaker' has returned to the gym and is now ready to fight again and could face the winner from the Battle of Britain contest between Tyson Fury and Dereck Chisora in July.

Ready to come back: David Haye is preparing to return to the ring later this year

Speaking to the Daily Express, Booth confirmed his charge's imminent comeback: 'It's true, 100 per cent true, David is 
coming back.

'We will not be making any big announcement but David has 
been given the all clear by his medical people and he wants to fight 
again.

'We plan to get back in the ring before the end of the year and preferably by October.

'David
 has started training and there is no need to keep this a secret any 
longer. He has been trying to recuperate for five and a half months and 
only now has he been given the all clear to fight again.'

Long time out: Haye has not fought since he stopped Dereck Chisora at West Ham in 2012

Haye has not fought since July 2012 when 
he came out of retirement to beat Dereck Chisora in the fifth round at 
Upton Park, and was then set to take on Manuel Charr before pulling out 
with a hand injury.

His fight with Fury was initially scheduled for last September but was postponed before finally being abandoned.
