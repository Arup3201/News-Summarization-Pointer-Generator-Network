Sarah Palin's oldest son, Track, is getting divorced just 18 months after tying the knot, in another blow to the family values advocate.

The 23-year-old and his wife, Britta, 22, married in May, 2011, and just three months later, Britta gave birth to a little girl, Kyla. But the pair filed for divorce in an Alaskan court this week, according to TMZ. 

The news of Track's marriage breakdown comes after his sister Bristol's very public relationship dramas.

Bristol, who famously got pregnant in 
2008 at age 18, was twice engaged to high school boyfriend Levi 
Johnston, but broke it off both times.

Under Alaska law, by filing for divorce together, Track and Britta are signaling they have fully settled property and custody issues, including child support of Kyla, who is now 15 months old.

According to TMZ, the agreement requires
 Track and Britta to watch a 48-minute video showing them how to explain
 the breakup of the family to their child.

Britta's mother, Mary Hanson, confirmed Britta and Track were
separated.

She told MailOnline: 'They’re not divorced, but they are separated.

Happy: The couple seemed happy about the birth of their child, though things obviously went downhill

'They're both very private and all I can say is that
they're concentrating on working to be the best parents they can be to their
daughter.'

Abstinence 
preacher Sarah Palin claimed she couldn't be happier when the high 
school sweethearts wed in a ski slope ceremony last May.

In a joint statement with Britta's parents, Ms Hanson and and Reverend Duane Hanson, the Palin's said they looked forward to the couple's 'blessed' life together, but didn't mention the pregnancy.

'Our families couldn't be 
happier! These are two hard working, humble, active, studious young 
adults who grew up together,' the parents said.

'We're tickled that after two decades
 of friendship we proudly witnessed their marriage, knowing their new 
life together will be blessed.'

After Kyla's birth, Britta's mother expressed her delight over her first grandchild, telling RadarOnline the little girl was 'great.'

'She’s beautiful. I’m very happy,' she said. 'I love my daughter and my son-in-law very much.'

It's unclear what led to the couple's marriage unraveling.

Kyla Grace is the second of Palin's 
grandchildren after her daughter Bristol gave birth to a boy Tripp, in 2008.

Palin has famously advocated that schools teach 
teenagers to abstain from sex before marriage and became an even stronger advocate after her daughter's unintended pregnancy.

Pictures of an excited Britta before the couple's daughter was born suggested they were happy about the impending birth.

One photo captioned 'my beautiful 
britta pie!' taken after a baby shower, shows
 the expectant mother smiling brightly and surrounded by gifts.

Another, posted on a Wasilla woman's Facebook wall, shows Britta holding up a small hoodie as she smiles at the camera.

Track became the first Palin child to get married when the couple wed last May.

He spent a year with the Army in 
Iraq as a reservist before the wedding. Britta, the daughter of a 
minister, studied nursing at the University of Alaska.

Track's love story seemed to be much happier than that of Sarah Palin's daughter Bristol, who was twice engaged to high school boyfriend Levi Johnston, but broke it off both times.

However, it appears that wasn't the case.
