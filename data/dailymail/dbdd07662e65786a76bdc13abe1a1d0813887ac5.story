Twit twoo, who's a pretty boy then!

Two owls roosting in Cape Coral, Florida, appear to be having a hoot as they get to grips with a GoPro camera.

Photographs show the bright-eyed birds posing in front of the lens, cracking semi-grins with their beaks open.

Wildlife photographer Megan Lorenz, 39, put the GoPro out on a patch of grass in a bid to film the animals and was charmed by their reactions. 

'My intention was actually to just get some video footage of the owls... but when I saw how interested the one owlet was but it turned out much better - and different! - than I had hoped,' she said.

Say cheese! Two owls roosting in Cape Coral, Florida, appear to be having a hoot as they get to grips with a GoPro camera

Is this my good side? Photographs show the bright-eyed birds posing in front of the lens cracking semi-grins with their beaks open

Lorenz continued: 'He would peck at the camera, nudge up to it and at times he pushed it over and practiced head-bobbing which is one of my favorite behaviors.' 

The feathered friends are burrowing owls which measure just 11 inches long and are native to North and South America. They get their name from the fact that they roost in burrows on the ground. 

Lorenz, who is based in Toronto, Ontario, has followed colonies of burrowing owls in Florida, for the past few years.

She concluded: 'I love photos that show a link between people, animals and their environment and I'm very happy that I had such a curious owlet to photograph this year. 

'When I take photos that I look back on years later and they make me laugh . . . that's when I know I have a winner. If they make me laugh, I hope that others have the same reaction.'

Most recently Lorenz has been capturing the wintry wildlife in Algonquin Provincial Park back home in Ontario. She is a recipient of Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal for her services to photography.

Caught off-guard: 'My intention was actually to just get some video footage of the owls... but when I saw how interested the one owlet was but it turned out much better - and different! - than I had hoped,' Lorenz said
