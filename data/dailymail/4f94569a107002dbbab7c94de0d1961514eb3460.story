A Birmingham mother claims she is lucky to be alive after tiles from the roof of her house were blown off by a low-flying plane.

Sharon Ward, 51, from Kitts Green, described the scene as 'absolute carnage' after about 20 of the slates smashed into her backyard.

The freak winds  are believed to have been caused by a vortex created by a plane that passed overhead at about 2.20pm on Saturday en route to the nearby Birmingham Airport.

Moments before Sharon heard the loud crash she said neighbouring children were playing just yards from where the large ceramic tiles smashed into the crowd.

'It looks like a bomb site as about 20 tiles came off and smashed in my garden and onto the furniture outside,' Sharon told the Birmingham Mail.

'I'm lucky I wasn't sunbathing as I am usually outside if there's a spot of sunshine. The tiles could have fallen onto me.

'The neighbour's children had been playing outside ten minutes earlier. They could have been seriously hurt.

'It's so dangerous and something needs to be done about this.

'Another neighbour was in his garden at the time and said he saw a plane flying low over my house.

'I tried calling the airport but I was told to call back on Monday.' 

The airport has confirmed they are 'looking into the incident' after being informed by the press. It is not known which plane was responsible or at what height it was flying.

It was reported in 2009 that hundreds of houses in the Kitts Green were forced to get new roofs after vortex winds caused by landing planes caused damage.

The findings of resulting studies by the airport and the company Kinetic, which works with the Ministry of Defence, were not conclusive.

The tiles, which Ward believes were blown off by a plane, smashed into her yard near where children  played

A member of the airport's environment team said: 'Locating risk areas is very difficult. It can be the case that one side of the street has strikes and the other hasn't - it is very difficult to predict.'

The incident comes more than a year after Heathrow Airport promised to repair a widow's house after a passenger jet caused tiles to fall off her room.

Grandmother-of-four Patricia Hills was left with three large holes - with shattered tiles thrown as far as 20ft away from her home. 

A spokesperson for Birmingham Airport said they are looking into the incident at Ward's house

'It looks like a bomb site as about 20 tiles came off and smashed in my garden,' Ward says

Some even smashed the headlights and dented the front of a neighbour's car.

At the time, Mrs Hills said the 'vortex' gust left the scene outside her home looking like a 'warzone'. She now fears for her safety at the house in Old Windsor, Berkshire - which is under Heathrow's flightpath.

A spokesman for BAA said in March 2013 an assessor had been to Mrs Hills' house and the company will now send men around to replace her damaged roof.

He said: 'It is rare, but we have a policy of carrying out repairs where this has happened to people.'

Mrs Hills said: 'BAA have acted honourably and I'm very pleased at their quick response.'
