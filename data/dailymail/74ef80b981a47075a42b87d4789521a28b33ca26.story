Sir Cliff Richard performed at a special charity event in Barbados over the weekend with his lifelong friend John McElynn. 

Sir Cliff played a set in front of fans on the Caribbean island in aid of severely brain damaged children for St Michael's parish on Saturday night. 

The 74-year-old singer, who has denied allegations that he targeted a young boy in the 1980s said: 'I have never, in my life, assaulted anyone.'

Two new alleged victims have come forward since the singer’s £3million Berkshire home was raided last August by detectives investigating a historic allegation of sexual assault on a teenage boy under 16 at a Christian rally in 1985.

South Yorkshire Police has set up a dedicated team of officers, under the name Operation Kaddie, to investigate allegations that three boys were molested.

Detectives have already taken statements from a number of witnesses as the probe widens.

Prosecutors are also liaising with police to give ‘investigative advice’ on how to take the investigation forward after officers received a significant number of new lines of inquiry.

So far, three people have come forward and made allegations against the veteran performer who has strenuously denied any impropriety.

David Crompton, South Yorkshire Police chief constable wrote to Keith Vaz MP, outlining the current state of the investigation, which has 'increased significantly in size', involving 'more than one allegation'.

Mr Vaz, who is chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, published the letter from Mr Crompton. 

According to the document: 'South Yorkshire Police detectives are in very regular contact with Sir Cliff Richard’s lawyers. Typically this involves a verbal update about once a fortnight.

‘We have not written directly to Sir Cliff Richard. It is the responsibility of his lawyers to ensure he is fully briefed on the conversations which have taken place with investigators.

‘This is an investigation which has increased significantly in size since its inception. Sir Cliff Richard’s lawyers are aware that there is more than one allegation.’

However, the singer, whose house was raided while he was on holiday in Portugal, released a statement in response.

He said: 'I have no idea where these absurd and untrue allegations come from. The police have not disclosed details to me.

‘I have never, in my life, assaulted anyone and I remain confident that the truth will prevail. I have cooperated fully with the police, and will, of course, continue to do so.

‘Beyond stating that the allegations are completely false, it would not be appropriate for me to say anything further until the investigation has concluded, which I hope will be very soon.

‘In the meantime, I would, again, like to thank everyone for supporting me through this unbelievably difficult period.’ 

The allegations against Sir Cliff, pictured, surfaced when a man in his 40s approached police last year

The police investigation first began last year when a man, now in his 40s, came forward to claim Sir Cliff sexually assaulted him at a rally in Sheffield held by American evangelist Billy Graham. 

He initially contacted Operation Yewtree, the Scotland Yard investigation set up in October 2012 to examine claims against Savile and other celebrities. 

The report was passed to South Yorkshire Police last year.

Police have already been heavily criticised over the way the case against the singer has unfolded.

The raid was recorded live by a BBC helicopter circling overhead capturing officers wearing forensic gloves searching through drawers after a reporter contacted the force claiming they had information about the investigation.
