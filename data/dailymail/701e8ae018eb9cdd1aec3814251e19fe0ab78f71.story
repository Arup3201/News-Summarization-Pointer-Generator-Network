New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady may be used to taking the field during the Super Bowl, but he traded gridiron turf for the links as the big game was played yesterday.

The two-time Super Bowl MVP was pictured at a golf course in Los Angeles, golfing with a pal and eager to put last season behind him.

In his driving cap, Brady looked more like a Newsies castmember than an All-Pro quarterback as he took his swings.

The Patriots were knocked out of the playoffs by the Baltimore Ravens - who would go on to capture the Super Bowl title from the San Francisco 49ers - on January 20.

Brady has been to five Super Bowls since he was drafted in 2000, winning three of them.

His last appearance in the big game was last year, when the Patriots fell short to the New York Giants 21-17, but he hasn't won one since 2005.

At age 35, there is much speculation over Brady's future. He has two more years left on his contract after signing an extension in 2010.

When that contract expires, the quarterback will be 38, but has indicated he would like to remain a Patriot until well after that.

Brady is a father of two children with Brazilian supermodel Giselle Bundchen.

He and his wife were in the news late last month after they put the finishing touches on their $20million Los Angeles mansion with countless amenities - including a moat.

He also has another son, John, from a previous relationship with actress Bridget Moynahan.
