It's time for us to clear out our drawers: one in three British women own more than ten bras and three quarters have confessed to owning some they haven't worn for a year or more, according to a new poll.

Two thirds also admit they haven't had a proper bra fitting in a whole year, according to the Lorriane/elleuk.com poll of 2,300 women.

But this October, ITV's Lorraine's Bin Your 
Bra campaign is giving women the perfect excuse to get rid of those ill-fitting spare bras by appealing to the UK to donate their unwanted underwear.

Against Breast Cancer has teamed up with BCR Global Textiles who help small businesses in Africa

Supporting Breast Cancer awareness 
month, many well known celebrities, including Barbara Windsor, Sharon 
and Kelly Osbourne and Dawn O'Porter have already given their bras to be
recycled, in order to raise vital funds for research into the disease.

The
bras are collected and sent to developing countries by the charity 
Against Breast Cancer, where traders support their families selling the 
textiles locally.

The charity has teamed up with BCR 
Global Textiles who help small businesses in Africa. Through their 
textile project, the company prevents valuable textiles going to landfill, 
giving them a new lease of life in developing countries across Africa, 
where bras remain too expensive to produce.

BCR
Global Textiles then donate a percentage of money back into Against 
Breast Cancer's research centre in London. The research centre focuses 
on many areas of the disease including further research into early 
detection and diagnosis.

Fronted
by Michelle Heaton, women will be asked to take their unwanted bras 
along to special Lorraine bins at House of Fraser stores.

Launching today, Lorraine's Bin 
Your Bra will feature on the programme over two weeks and will hear from
high-profile women affected by the disease, including singers Anastacia
and Linda Nolan.

Anastacia said: 'l'm donating my bra for 
the Lorraine campaign. This is an amazing concept, raising money and 
awareness for a cause so close to my heart. Ladies, bin your bra and 
help make a difference.'

Dr 
Hilary Jones will also be highlighting the latest research, as well as carrying out a live breast 
examination.

Lorraine Kelly said: 'Our Bin Your Bra
campaign is a great way to help Against Breast Cancer's important and 
ongoing research into the disease, whilst also getting rid of those 
unused bras in the back of your underwear drawers. 

'I've got quite few to donate - so come on ladies, Bin your Bra.'

Other celebrities donating their bras 
include Penny Lancaster, Loose Women stars, Ruth Langsford, the cast of 
Coronation Street, Carol McGiffin, Celia Walden, Honor Blackman, Linda 
Barker and Rachel Stevens.

Against Breast Cancer added: 'This fun 
project keeps textiles out of landfill, helps small businesses in Africa
and raises funds for our groundbreaking research.

'The donation to our research work is based on the weight of bras collected so more bras mean more funds. Every £1 you raise is vital in enabling us continue our work to find a vaccine against breast cancer and to look at ways to increase the survival of women who have the disease.'

Lorraine's Bin Your Bra, launches Tuesday October 1, ITV, weekdays, 8.30-9.25am. #binyourbra

Bras can be donated in 56 House of Fraser stores, or can be posted to the Against Breast Cancer charity. All details can be found at itv.com/lorraine.

Elle supports breast cancer awareness month in their November issue

A new Ann Summers survey has discovered that
80 per cent of women have a faithful security blanket bra that 
they've owned for up to three years.

Their results also showed half of 
women hoard more than 20 bras at one time.

But a further 9 
per cent admitted to keeping hold of their bras for more than 4 years.

So it's no surprise that 60 per cent
of bra hoarders are spilling out or squeezing themselves into 
wrong-sized bras that are at least one cup too big or small.

A further 8
per cent have been wearing a poorly-fitted bra for over five years.
