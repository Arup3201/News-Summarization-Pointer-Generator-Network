SAS sniper: Sergeant Danny Nightingale, 38, arrives at Bulford Military Court Centre in Wiltshire with his wife Sally to plead not guilty

An SAS sniper faces a retrial over illegally possessing a pistol and ammunition - despite a last-minute claim prosecutors acted improperly by consulting on the case.

Sergeant Danny Nightingale, 38, today pleaded not guilty at Bulford Military Court Centre in Wiltshire to illegally possessing a Glock 9mm pistol and more than 300 rounds of ammunition.

He was convicted and sentenced to military detention last year for keeping the Iraqi pistol as a war trophy before having his sentence reduced and conviction subsequently quashed by Court of Appeal judges.

At a preparatory hearing to discuss the future of the case today, Judge Advocate Jeff Blackett said there was no abuse of process relating to content in emails apparently leaked by a Ministry of Defence source, which were referred to for the first time at the hearing.

He said: ‘Provided I am satisfied that there has been no bad faith or dishonesty and that the exercise of a prosecutorial discretion has been conscientiously undertaken, I should direct that the matter proceeds to trial.

‘I am so satisfied. There is no abuse of process and I dismiss the defendant’s application to stay these proceedings.’

Sgt Nightingale’s counsel, Simon McKay, told the court about emails leaked by an MoD ‘whistle-blower’ which he said appeared to show the Director of Service Prosecutions consulting the military ‘chain of command’ - the Adjutant General’s office - on whether or not to pursue the case against the soldier.

Mr McKay said: ‘There is an issue of disclosure. In theory the effect of this meeting is rather like the Director of Public Prosecutions saying to the head of the Metropolitan Police: “I’m thinking of charging one of your officers, I’d be interested in your views, thank you very much”.’

However, prosecutors said there was nothing ‘improper’ with the conduct alleged in the email.

Counsel
Timothy Cray told the court: ‘If there was a basis, for a second, to 
think that the Director of Service Prosecutions said to the AG: “Tell me
what you want me to do, I will roll over and go with the army’s view”, 
then there is something in my friend’s point.’

But he said there was nothing in the evidence which suggested a breach of regulations.

Sgt
Nightingale, from the Duke of Lancaster regiment, appeared in court 
wearing full military uniform and answered ‘not guilty’ to two charges 
put to him today. The trial is expected to start on July 1.

His family said outside court that they were ‘bitterly disappointed’ with the judge’s ruling.

'Sal and the family have been amazing, strong, very robust. I think a lot of people would have crumbled'

Describing his court ordeal so far, the soldier said today: ‘I wouldn't wish it on anyone's family - it's horrible. That's not just for Sally, myself and the kids, it's on the wider family. It's hard.

‘Thanks to everybody, the family who have come from around the world for this, thanks to the public and to the media who have been very supportive throughout.’

Paying tribute to his partner, he added: ‘Without her, without Sal and the family, I wouldn't be here now. They've been amazing, strong, very robust. I think a lot of people would have crumbled.’

Mrs Nightingale said: ‘Our lives are on hold completely. Every day is consumed by this case, all our conversations with our friends and family are consumed by this case. We've all struggled through it.’

Sally Nightingale

She said the financial pressures were being supported by a charitable organisation, which was helping raise money for their fight to clear the soldier's name.

She added: ‘We want a fair trial and to feel Danny has been given a fair trial. We're obviously bitterly disappointed today that we are going ahead with a re-trial now.

‘But in some respects there are still a lot of unanswered questions for us. Danny's pleaded not guilty today and we're still looking for the right outcome.’

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
