A mother  found dead in a suspected murder-suicide had taken out an intervention order against her estranged husband which expired just four days earlier.

The former couple’s flatmate heard moaning noises coming from a bedroom in the moments before Shikha Godara Beniwal died, but he did not intervene because he thought they were having sex.

Homicide detectives have confirmed the ex-couple, who had a three-year-old son, were known to them due to a history of domestic violence going back at least two years.

Melbourne physiotherapist Shikha Godara Beniwal was murdered by her estranged husband Sunil just four days after the intervention order she had in place against him expired

It is believed Sunil Beniwal, 36, killed Shikha Godara Beniwal at his home in Deer Park, in west Melbourne, on Saturday night or in the early hours of Sunday before committing suicide by veering into an oncoming truck. 

The Beniwal's  son was in the house at the time of the suspected murder, along with Sunil's unsuspecting flatmates, James Negri and his girlfriend.

Negri's younger brother, Jackson Kelly, said his sibling had heard the little boy crying and  the sound of a woman moaning but didn't call the police as he thought they were having sex. 

He said his brother is 'shaken up' and had never witnessed any fights between the estranged couple and thought they were trying to get back together as Shikha was a regular visitor to the house.

Kelly,17, told Fairfax Media: 'They had just come back from India. I thought they were trying to work it out.

'He seemed like a nice, normal guy. I don't know why he turned like this. I can't believe it.'

Although the police won't release how Shikha, 32, died until after an autopsy, they said they are yet to find a weapon and are not looking for anyone else in connection with her murder.

The couple had a history of domestic abuse and were known to police but Sunil's flat-mate thought they were trying to work things out and said they recently travelled to India together

They believe Sunil murdered her and then fled in his car, committing suicide  by swerving into a truck around 4am. He died on impact and the driver, a father-of-four, Tom Delios is still in hospital.

The emergency services rushed to the crash site on Hopkins Rd, Truganina, near Caroline Springs, and police discovered his wife's body just hours later at his Corey Close home at around 7.45 am.

Homicide Detective Sergeant Paul Tremain has confirmed Sunil and Delhi-born physiotherapist Shikha were known to them due to domestic violence.

While Sunil died on impace, the driver of the truck is still being treated in hospital for shock and minor injuries

He said: 'There was an intervention order taken out in 2012 which expired four days ago. 

'It's a shocking circumstance of two people who couldn't work out their differences and it's ended in a tragedy like this.

'We need an autopsy to be carried out and once that's happened we'll be in a better position to know what has gone on.' 

Police trying to contact Sunil's next of kin discovered Shika's body at his home in Deer Park, Melbourne

Devastated relatives of the couple congregated at the house on Sunday where she was murdered 

Police were still at the property Sunday night as grieving relatives arrived and confirmed they are treating her death as suspicious and are not looking for anyone else.

The  couple's young son has been taken into care of the Department of Human Services.
