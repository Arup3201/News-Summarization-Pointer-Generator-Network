Hospitals should let more elderly patients die, a top cardiologist has claimed.

Dr James Beattie believes that doctors resuscitate too many older people because society does not see enough death, leaving many people unwilling to accept mortality.

He pointed out that frail pensioners routinely receive hospital medical interventions such as flu jabs which are designed to prolong life, but not necessarily improve it.

The cardiologist said that when it comes to resuscitating the elderly, particularly those with dementia, patients’ quality of life should be given more consideration and more people should be allowed to die.

‘If a person is in hospital, particularly an elderly person with multiple co-morbidities, if they have a cardiac arrest it’s a sign they are in decline,’ he told Radio 4.

‘It’s their act of dying and they should not be resuscitated, they should be allowed to die.’ 

Dr Beattie, who works at the East of England NHS Foundation Trust in Birmingham, explained that the chance of an elderly person leaving hospital after being resuscitated is around 5 per cent.

But he said the issue was a difficult one because people today are less likely to think and talk about death thanks to advancements in modern medicine, which mean that people are living longer.

‘Society these days is much less familiar with death,’ he said, adding: ‘Our great-grandparents and to some extent our grandparents grew up with people dying before the days of antibiotics. 

‘That’s denied these days. People died at home. Death is now becoming something in hospitals and care homes, somewhere removed from the family and the home.’

He went on to say: ‘We need to make it a more natural expectation. Life is 100 per cent mortality and we need to get used to that.’ 

Family doctors are taking up valuable consultation time asking patients to sign petitions demanding extra cash for their surgeries, it emerged last night.

The average consultation is just seven minutes long. But despite claiming they often do not have enough time to listen to patients’ problems, some GPs have been using consultations to drum up support for extra funding.

The move follows an email from the Royal College of GPs, which urged practices to get as many patients’ names as possible to bolster their campaign.

Andrew Percy, a Tory member of the Commons health select committee, said: ‘It’s staggering that GPs claim to not have enough time to complete consultations with patients, but they can find time to get patients to sign petitions.

‘I doubt many patients feel comfortable saying no. This is a clear abuse of their position, especially as I suspect that with greater funding would come calls for even greater GP salaries.’
