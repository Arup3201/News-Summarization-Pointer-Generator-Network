A man and a woman have been arrested today in connection with a stabbing took at a christening party just yards from David Cameron's former home.

Officers swooped on an address in Ladbrooke Grove, west London, this afternoon and took a 25-year-old man and a 32-year-old woman into custody.

They are currently being questioned at a south London police station on suspicion of GBH with intent.

It came after 33-year-old man was seriously hurt and another man slightly injured in a fight outside a bowling club in North Kensington, around 500 yards away from where the suspects were arrested.

The incident is said to have taken place after the victim gatecrashed the event yesterday afternoon.

It is believed a feud that had been simmering between the victim and another man, the Evening Standard reported.

Pat White, president of the West 
London Bowling Club, told the paper: 'There was a christening, which was
all going beautifully and people were having a wonderful time.

'The person who was uninvited came in and was being good as gold himself. Suddenly something happened and it turned sour.'

Police and ambulance crews were called
to reports of a man being injured after a fight in Highlever Road and 
Barlby Road at around 5.45pm yesterday.

A 33-year-old man was treated at the 
scene and taken to hospital with a serious injuries. He was said to be 
stable in hospital today.

Another man, who is also in his 30s, was treated at the scene for a minor injury.

The incident took place just a few hundred yards from the former home of the Prime Minister.

Mr Cameron moved his family out of the
£1.5million four bedroom house in North Kensington soon after he was 
elected Prime Minister. He is believed to have rented the house out.

In February three teenagers were stabbed in a brawl in North Kensington, none was seriously injured.

Scotland Yard said the incident was being investigated by local borough officers.
