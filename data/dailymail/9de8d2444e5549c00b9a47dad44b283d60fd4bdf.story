R. Kelly's 14-year-old child, Jaya, has come out as transgender and changed his name to 'Jay'.

The brave teen made the announcement on his social media pages over the weekend and also revealed that his singer dad has yet to speak to him since the revelation.

Responding to questions on his Ask.fm profile, Jay explained that although he was born biologically female, he has identified as a male since he was '6 or 7' and that his mother has known for a year.

His mom Andrea Kelly, the singer's ex-wife and star of reality series 'Hollywood Exes', has been supportive of his transition and has proudly shared pictures of them together online.

Proud: Jay Kelly, whose father is singer R. Kelly, has revealed that he is female-to-male transgender and living as a boy. He said that he is not close to his father and they have not spoken about his announcement

'My mom was like, "Baby, you know I love you if you were bi, gay, lesbian, you name it and I would still love you so much",' he wrote.

'She was very proud of me, I was like, "Thank you mom for accepting the fact that I'm a transgender".'

'And same with my sister, she told me that she was proud of me, and respects me by calling me handsome and calling me her little brother now, and I love her for that, so you know it was great for me.'

He added that he is eager to undergo the gender realignment operations but that he knows he'll have to wait for several years.

Support: His mom, Andrea Kelly, who stars on 'Hollywood Exes', has been supportive of his announcement

Loved: Jay, right, said that his older sister Joann, left, has also told him that she is proud of him

'I believe I am a boy and want surgery, and the medication to help me (be) who I was supposed to be,' he wrote.

From a very young age he knew he did not want to be a girl, wear dresses, grow his hair long or have breasts or female sexual organs, he explained on Ask.fm.

Aged 11, 'I would look up like boy 
changes to girl, and girl changes to boy, and im like wow, theres people
 who feel EXACTLY the way i feel and then i knew like thats what transgender is,' he wrote.

He added that he was about six when he knew he was attracted to girls - but he has no plans to date any just yet, adding: 'I've got a lot on my plate right now.'

Silence: R. Kelly, who divorced Jay's mother in 2009, has not spoken to him about his announcement

His father has yet to publicly comment on the teen's announcement, but Jay revealed on Ask.fm that he and his sister are not close to the singer, even though their older brother is.

He added: 'I absolutely love my mother... and yea my dad has not reached out.'

R. Kelly divorced Jay's mother, who had been his former backup dancer, in 2009 after almost 13 years of marriage.
