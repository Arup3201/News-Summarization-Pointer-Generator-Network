These stunning photos reveal both the terrifying power and the unusual beauty of the great white shark.

The images, captured by photographer Chris McLennan, show the sharks exploding out of the water with helpless seals clamped between their jaws.

But luckily for the inhabitants of Seal Island in South Africa these sharks are only biting down on a decoy set up to tempt them from the deep.

Power: A great white shark breaches the surface and bites down on a decoy seal off Seal Island, South Africa. The startling image shows the power of the shark as it hits its 'prey' at full speed

Dramatic: The stunning shots - which show a number of sharks hurtling through the waves while hunting - were captured by wildlife photographer Chris McLennan

Caught: The tail of the decoy hangs from between the jaws of this huge shark as it launched itself from the deep. The power of its attack can be seen from the spray that surrounds it

Flight: The great white hurtles through the air, demonstrating the species' incredible power and strength - and showing why they are among the world's most feared predators

The waters around Seal Island are a key hunting ground for one of the world's most feared - and misunderstood - predators.

Mr McLennan spotted 28 hits on the decoy seal by hungry Great Whites as he waited with his camera poised.

The images show the sharks flying three to four feet clear of the water with the decoy in their mouths, demonstrating the incredible speed and power they use while hunting.

The great white shark's have been known to grow to up to 20ft in length and can weigh 5,000 lb. The species reaches full maturity at around 15 years of age and can have a life span of over 30 years.

Due to their portrayal in a number of films, great whites have been demonised as relentless 'man-eaters' - where as in reality humans are a long way down their list of favoured prey.

Doomed: In this attack a real young seal's body can be seen hanging limply from the shark's mouth as it crashes through the surface of the water

Meal: The Great White begins its descent into the depths with its meal. The waters off South Africa are an important hunting area for the sharks
