The FA are set to decide Jonny Evans’s fate today after the Manchester United defender denied allegations of spitting at Newcastle striker Papiss Cisse.

A disciplinary hearing was hastily set up last night after Evans confirmed his intention to fight the charge which will carry a six-game ban if he is found guilty.

The FA wanted to make sure the matter was dealt with swiftly before the Northern Ireland international played in United’s FA Cup quarter-final clash with Arsenal at Old Trafford on Monday night.

They tweeted confirmation of Evans’s decision on Friday, just over an hour after the 6pm deadline he had been given to respond to the charge.

It read: ‘Manchester United’s Jonny Evans denies FA charge in relation to incident involving Papiss Cisse. Independent Regulatory Commission hearing tonight, decision expected tomorrow.’

It is understood that United will submit video evidence to support Evans’s claim that he did not spit directly at Cisse. 

Both players were charged over the unsavoury incident in United’s 1-0 win at St James’ Park on Wednesday night.

Cisse issued a public apology and accepted his guilt, triggering an immediate seven-match ban. The Senegal striker’s suspension is one game longer because he had already served a three-match ban earlier this season.

Evans was expected to contest the charge after issuing a statement on Thursday denying any knowledge of a spitting incident, which followed a tackle between the two players in the first half.

He said: ‘Having woken up this morning I am shocked to have seen the media coverage from last night’s match. I would like to make it clear that I did not spit at Papiss Cisse.

‘I was totally unaware of any spitting incident and had assumed that the issue at the time was with the challenge and his attempted retaliation to the tackle from the floor.

Cisse has been banned for seven games after accepting the charge from the FA on Thursday

‘During the game Papiss Cisse and I spoke about the incident and it is clear by my reaction in the television footage that I was totally surprised by any suggestion of spitting.

‘It is not in my character or in my nature to spit at anybody nor is it something I have ever done or would ever do. It is certainly not something that I did last night.’

United boss Louis van Gaal also defended his player, insisting that he believed Evans’s version of events.

Spitting is understandably reviled among the majority of Premier League players, but Stoke striker Jonathan Walters mounted a surprisingly robust objection on Friday by threatening to leave any opponent who targeted him in such a manner ‘eating through a straw’.

The FA are unlikely to take any action against Walters but will not welcome any talk of physical violence on the pitch.

Walters told talkSPORT: ‘As a player you take anything off the ball; pinches and kicks that are meant to wind you up. Little things like that go on in any match.

‘But spitting is pretty low. If it happened to me and someone spat at my face or towards me then I think he’d be eating his supper through a straw that night. I wouldn’t be that happy. It’s the lowest of the low.’
