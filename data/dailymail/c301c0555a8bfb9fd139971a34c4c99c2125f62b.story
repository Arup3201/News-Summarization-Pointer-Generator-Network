The largest solar-panel plant in the world, built near the Mojave desert, has been blamed for blinding pilots flying over the California facility.

The Ivanpah plant, in San Bernardino, uses 173,500 mirrors to reflect sunlight on to boilers, but despite its green credentials it has been criticized as a flying hazard.

Two anonymous complaints were made to the Federal Aviation Administration in August last year, complaining of a 'blinding glare' coming off the plant.

The complaints came from a pilot who had taken off from Boulder City, and an air traffic controller working at a Los Angeles airport.

Every day, dozens of flights pass 
over the sprawling desert plant, which is under a flight path between 
Las Vegas and southern California.

A spokesman for the FAA told Daily Caller: 'The FAA is aware of potential glare from solar plants and is exploring how to best alert pilots to the issue.'

In one of the complaints, the pilot 
of a small transport plane described the glare from the mirrors, which 
are the size of garage doors, as 'like looking into the sun'.

The pilot and air traffic controller are not the only ones to have concerns about the plant.

Environmental
 groups are concerned about the impact of species such as the desert 
tortoise, which lost habitat during the building of the 3,500-acre 
facility, and birds injured by the intense heat given off by the 
mirrors.

The world's 
largest solar plant however, is able to provide clean, green power to 
140,000 homes - the equivalent of taking 72,000 cars off the road.

The plant's 173,500 mirrors, known as heliostats, reflect sunlight onto huge water towers, which are 459ft high - 100ft taller than the Statue of Liberty.

Steam is produced which can power a turbine.

As well as using a renewable power supply - the sun - the plant uses 95 percent less water than other thermal facilities.

The pilot and co-pilot were 'distracted and momentarily blinded by the sun reflecting off of mirrors' the written complaint stated.

'In my opinion the reflection from these
 mirrors was a hazard to flight because for a brief time I could not 
scan the sky in that direction to look for other aircraft,' the pilot added.

The air traffic controller also 
warned of the dangers of glare, saying the tower received daily 
complaints as pilots passed over the facility in the late morning and 
early afternoon.

'On this particular morning, an air 
carrier complained about the brightness and reiterated that it was "nearly blinding",' the controller said.

'I have no idea what can 
be done about this situation, but being a passenger on an aircraft that 
flew through this airspace and saw it for myself, I would say that 
something needs to be done. It is extremely bright and distracting.'

At
 the time of the complaints, the facility was still being built. The 
developer, BrightSource Energy was also in the process of 'testing and 
calibrating' the mirrors.

The $2.2 billion plant covers 3,500 acres near the Mojave desert and can be seen from the International Space Station, according to the SB Sun.

It started generating power in December last year, and is capable of providing clean power to 140,000 homes.

NRG Energy, which co-owns and runs 
the plants, has been notified of the complaints and is due to release a 
statement about it soon.

An
 impact study was carried out before work started at the plant, during 
which pilots and air crew had raised concerns about glare.

The
 study was reported to have found that the plant could cause temporary 
blindness to pilots withing 3,300ft of the mirrors, but the layout was 
reconfigured to minimize the risk.
