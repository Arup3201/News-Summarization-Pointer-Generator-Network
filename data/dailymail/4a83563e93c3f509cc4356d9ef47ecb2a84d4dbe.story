Two men caught on security cameras in two service stations are believed to hold 'vital clues' into the murder of a frail grandfather in his home earlier this month.

Raymond Parker's beaten body was discovered by a friend, after relatives had no luck getting in contact with the 75-year-old, upstairs in his property on Koo Wee Rup-Longwarry Road in Bayles, Victoria, around 2.20pm on January 13.

Mr Parker, a retired butcher who was in remission for cancer, had his wallet, credit cards and cash stolen at the time of the unexplained attack and his cards were used at two different petrol stations between January 10 and 12.

Police have confirmed that CCTV footage reveals two men in a white van arrived at both stations and purchased goods during this time period.   

Police hope the two men in this video can be identified to help solve the mysterious murder of Raymond Parker

The men were seen purchasing goods at both petrol stations during the same period that Mr Parker's stolen cards had been used

Mr Parker was last seen on the morning of January 6 and was discovered dead on January 13

Homicide squad detectives are keen to speak to the men as they believe they may hold vital clues that will assist in the investigation into Mr Parker's death - who was last seen alive on the morning of January 6.

Detective Senior Sergeant Stephen McIntyre said it was not known what involvement the two men may have had in Mr Parker's death.

'We are hoping that by speaking with these men it could give us some information that will assist the investigation into Ray's death,' he said. 

'It appears he was assaulted and this could have incapacitated him, causing him to die several days after the initial assault.'

Police also located a small hydroponic cannabis set-up at Mr Parker's property. 

'We also can't rule out at this stage that the presence of drugs at his property is connected to his death in some way, Sen-Sgt McIntyre said.

'We're urging anyone with information regarding the identity of these men or the circumstances surrounding Ray's death to come forward.'

Investigators have released CCTV footage and images of the two men and the white van in the hope someone can provide information regarding their identity. 

Sen Sgt McIntyre  described Mr Parker as a 'knockabout bloke' who 'kept to himself.'

'He was a fairly frail man, he was in ill health and he wouldn’t have posed any risk or threat to anyone,’’ Sen-Sgt McIntyre told the Herald Sun.

Anyone with any information is urged to contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000 or submit a confidential crime report at crimestoppersvic.com.au
