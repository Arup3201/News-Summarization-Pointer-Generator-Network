Two former top advisers to Bill Clinton have warned Barack Obama that he will lose to Mitt Romney in November if he does not abandon the ‘fool’s errand’ of trying to persuade Americans that the economy is getting better.

In a 16-page paper, James Carville, Clinton’s top campaign manager in 1992, Stan Greenberg, Clinton’s pollster in 1992, and Erica Seifert, a leading Democratic strategist, argue that a ‘new narrative’ is needed for Obama to win re-election.

Carville coined the dictum ‘it’s the economy, stupid’, while Greenberg was the person who identified ‘Reagan Democrats’ as a key voting bloc in the 1980s.

Their stinging critique is a sign of panic among Democrats about Obama’s campaign as well as a potential split between Obama and old hands from the Clinton era who believe he has moved too far to the Left.

Obama and Romney are currently in a statistical dead heat in most national polls with Obama leading by 1.6 per cent in the RealClearPolitics average. In a commentary for Fox News, Joe Trippi, a veteran Democratic campaign strategist said: ‘I believe the race is even tighter than the Real Clear Politics averages indicate’.

He added: ‘Five months is a long time in presidential politics -- the pendulum can swing back and forth several times between now and November. But at this moment, as a Democrat who wants to see Barack Obama re-elected, there is no denying that the pendulum is moving in the wrong direction.’

The paper, by Democracy Corps and Greenberg Quinlan Rosner, is based on extensive work with focus groups in Ohio and Pennsylvania, states that Hillary Clinton won in the Democratic primaries of 2008 and where Obama has struggled to connect with blue collar voters.

‘It is elites who are creating a conventional wisdom that an incumbent president must run on his economic performance – and therefore must convince voters that things are moving in the right direction,’ the top Democratic strategists contend.

‘They are wrong, and that will fail.’

The paper could be seen as a pre-emptive post mortem should Obama lose to Romney in November, perhaps laying the foundation for a presidential bid by Hillary Clinton in 2016.

Its argument is all the more devastating for Obama because it identifies fundamental weaknesses in Romney’s candidacies, arguing that it is only what they see as Romney’s significant vulnerabilities that has kept Obama in contention.

The strategists state bluntly that voters don’t believe Obama’s central campaign message that the economy is getting better.

‘These voters are not convinced that we are headed in the right direction. They are living in a new economy - and there is no conceivable recovery in the year ahead that will change the view of the new state of the country.

‘They actually have a very realistic view of the long road back and the struggles of the middle class - and the current narrative about progress just misses the opportunity to connect and point forward.

While we hear some optimism, this is framed mostly by the sense that this has to be rock bottom.'

This means that Obama ‘will face an impossible headwind in November, unless his campaign shifts to a more realistic economic message that offers solutions to voters who are struggling terribly.

'The pendulum can swing back and forth 
several times between now and November. But...as a 
Democrat who wants to see Barack Obama re-elected, there is no denying 
that the pendulum is moving in the wrong direction.'

-Democratic strategist Joe Trippi

The key to an Obama victory, the paper says, is a new message ‘with minimal discussion of the recovery and jobs created and maximal empathy for the challenges people face’.

Obama, the paper suggests, risks being seen as out of touch with ordinary Americans if he keeps pretending things are improving. ‘These voters want to know that he understands the struggle of working families and has plans to make things better.’

This comment comes after Obama’s remark on Friday that ‘the private sector is doing just fine’ prompted a furore and gleeful attacks from Romney and other Republicans.

Obama has repeatedly stressed ‘progress’ in interviews this week.

On Friday, he opened by saying that ‘after losing jobs for 25 months in a row, our businesses have now created jobs for 27 months in a row - 4.3 million new jobs in all’ and ‘job growth in this recovery has been stronger than in the one following the last recession a decade ago’.

The strategists state, however, that ‘the current narrative about progress just misses the opportunity to connect and point forward’.

Bill Clinton recently made clear his dissatisfaction with Obama’s message, particularly the attacks on Romney’s work as a venture capitalist with Bain Capital.

Telling CNN that Romney had had a ‘good business career’ at Bain, he said: ‘I don't think that we ought to get into the position where we say “This is bad work”. This is good work. The man who has been governor and had a sterling business career crosses the qualification threshold.’
