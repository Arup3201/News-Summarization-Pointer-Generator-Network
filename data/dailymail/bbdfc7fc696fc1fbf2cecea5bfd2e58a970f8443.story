A grandmother with an allergy to penicillin died after a doctor and nurse missed seven warnings against using the antibiotic, an inquest has heard.

Susan Hammond, 61, had previously suffered bad reactions to the medication on two occasions.

One injection of the antibiotic had once even triggered a heart attack, the inquest in Lincoln heard.

Susan Hammond, who was allergic to penicillin, died after doctors and nurses missed seven warnings against using the antibiotic, an inquest has heard

But when Ms Hammond was admitted to hospital with a suspected chest infection, despite her allergy being marked on all of her notes and even a bright red warning wristband, she was still prescribed and given penicillin-based antibiotic Augmentin, it was said.

The Mirror reports that her allergy was marked on her notes from Accident and Emergency and the ambulance, a letter from her nursing home, and an Emergency Admissions Unit (EAU) form.

The inquest heard it was also highlighted on her prescription chart, doctor’s notes, and the allergy wristband.

Dr Viv Gunasekera prescribed the penicillin-based drugs and nurse Susan Elliott administered it, it was said.

The inquest heard the widow died after suffering a massive anaphylactic reaction.

Coroner Stuart Fisher told nurse Susan Elliott that while the fault did not entirely lie with her, there had been a 'number of occasions' when she should have been aware of the patient's allergy to penicillin.

He said: 'Despite those seven indications... you carried on and administered Augmentin.'

It also emerged at the inquest that attempts to save Ms Hammond's life had been ended because a doctor thought she did not want to be resuscitated - unbeknown to distraught members of her family.

Nurse Diane Payne told the hearing Dr 
Nivedita Ghosh made the decision to halt resuscitation, and that her 
feeling was that they 'stopped it too soon'.

Mother-of-two Ms Hammond was living in a care home in North Clifton, Lincolnshire, when she became ill in July, 2009.

She was admitted to A&E at Lincoln County Hospital after staff became concerned and called for an ambulance.

The inquest heard, after nurses first gave the grandmother non-penicillin antibiotics they marked her allergy with the warning wristband and she was sent to the Emergency Admissions Unit.

It was said that on July 3, at 3.10am, nurse Elliott then administered the antibiotic containing penicillin, despite a telephone conversation between Dr Viv Gunasekera and members of staff at the care home.

Ms Hammond's daughter Alison Wane and son Paul Hammond, had also been unaware that attempts to save Ms Hammond's life had been ended because a doctor thought she did not want to be resuscitated

The medic - who is now a registrar - was said t have concluded that the reaction could not have been severe as no-one at the nursing home knew what it was.

Ms Hammond died shortly after the injection.

Nurse Elliot told the inquest of her 'upset' at delivering the injection and Dr Gunasekera said she was 'very, very sorry', according to the paper.

The week-long inquest is expected to finish today.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
