In an industry obsessed with staying young, one fashion icon is celebrating grannies with a new book.

Legendary Vogue photographer Tim Walker collaborates with illustrator Lawrence Mynott and writer Kit Hesketh-Harvey for two volumes of coffee table book The Granny Alphabet.

The insightful coffee table book champions cool and fashionable older women.

The coffee-table book features features photographs of ladies of a certain age in cutting-edge fashions

Book one of this two-volume collection offers an assortment of Walker's characterful portraits

Walker's photographs of ladies of a certain age in cutting-edge fashions and strutting their own poses feature alongside Mynott's playful illustrations and Hesketh-Harvey's humorous words.

'Part photographic love letter to the 
elderly and part documentation of the dying breed of little old ladies 
who live down the lane,' in Walker's own words.

Book one of this two-volume collection offers an assortment of Walker's characterful portraits of grannies and the things dearest to them.

The first page of A Is For Alphabet features an older lady with a walking stick and chic croc bag

Snaps of their most treasured possessions accompany Tim's pictures of the stylish grannies 

These are arranged alphabetically and accompanied by short, gently funny verses written by Hesketh-Harvey.

In
 Book two, fashion illustrator Lawrence Mynott contributes his own A–Z 
featuring 96 drawings of lively, fashionably fierce older ladies.

Spirited, stylish, sweet - there are granny archetypes of every stripe.

The
 affectionate two-volume A–Z is a whimsical vision of a rose-printed, 
feline-filled arcadia and will be irresistible to style-setters, 
photography enthusiasts and anyone touched by its delightful tribute to 
the grannies we love and admire.

 Hesketh-Harvey is an award-winning performer, composer, writer and

Artist-photographer Tim Walker has 
won a cult following for his flamboyant, lavishly staged and surrealist 
fashion photography. Now he brings his unique brand of very British 
fantasia to a subject close to his and all our hearts: grandmothers.

In the book you’ll find Lucinda, whose hat addiction shows no sign of 
waning (she even goes to bed in one), and Hattie, who’ll give you a 
humbug if you’re helpful.

The
 Granny Alphabet by Tim Walker, Lawrence Mynott and Kit Hesketh-Harvey 
(Thames & Hudson) comes in at £24.95 and is available to buy from 
Amazon form November 11.

All proceeds are being donated to Friends of the Elderly, fote.org.uk. Text 'Friends' to 70007 to donate £3.
