Most groggy-eyed workers need a kick in the mornings.

But a businessman is offering a buzz which will make most bosses frown - a nice bottle of cannabis-infused iced coffee.

At up to $11 each, the drinks could be on sale as soon as next month and are the brainchild of an entrepreneur in Washington state, one of only two in the U.S. where selling the drug is legal.

Coffee pot: Cannabis-infused iced coffee could soon be on sale in Washington state and Colorado

The drinks will contain 20 milligrams of THC, the active ingredient in cannabis, roughly the same amount as in half a joint.

And their website makes no secret of their promised effects, claiming the Cold Brew, coffee infused with cannabis, is the 'the John Wayne of cold brews - strong and bold with a true cowboy’s swagger.'

Cannabis is decriminalised in almost 20 states - but only for possession or medical use, and in some it can still be a small-scale violation.

The drink will only be sold in markets where selling cannabis is fully legal, including for recreational use. These are:

WASHINGTON STATE

Small amounts were legalised for over-21s in 2012, but regulatory delays meant the first licences were only granted in March this year.

COLORADO

Legalised last year and the first stores opened in January. Over-21s can grow up to six plants or possess up to an ounce with no penalty.

It adds: 'Knock one back with your 
compadres and take on the day with a smooth buzz and a grin a mile 
wide... A powerful body buzz and a smooth, freeing head high.'

Another
drink's advert claims: 'Drinking this coffee is like riding a cool avalanche of pure 
deliciousness down a tall mountain and landing in an ocean of good 
feelings.

'You’ll swim off into a day of work or play filled to the brim with pure joy.'

The
 soft drinks are set to come in five flavours, including cherry, lemon 
ginger and pomegranate, and will only be on sale where cannabis is 
legal.

Called Mirth Provisions, the firm was dreamed up by e-commerce firm manager Adam Stites, 34, in the city of Longview, Washington.

He told MailOnline he has been working on the drink for about six months.

'I wanted to be part of the history of my home state,' he said 'It's revolutionary and a great opportunity to establish some intellectual property in this state.

'It wasn't simple. We're still using two strains of it, then there's the dynamic of how it plays with the caffeine.'

Mr Stites added: 'We
 don't want to pack so much THC into every one of our drinks that it's 
unpleasant, especially for people that are just getting into marijuana.

'I'm 6ft 4in and 205 pounds, and 20mg is sufficient for me, especially when it's brewed with coffee'.

Chill out! In case any customers were in doubt, each bottle reminds them of its legality in huge lettering

He
 claimed he will be able to produce 'several hundred bottles per hour' after the manufacturing method gains approval from state regulators.

The drink passed its final tests with the Washington State Liquor Control Board on May 16.

There is just one stumbling block - its drinkers may not be allowed to drive.

Cannabis
 is decriminalised in almost 20 states, but in the vast majority of 
those it is still a civil offence or only allowed for medical use.

Tax hit: Colorado has collected more than $12m

Only two states allow the drug and related products to be sold.

Washington state legalised cannabis for recreational use in 2012, and after several delays the first licences were granted to stores this year.

The drug is also legal in Colorado, where over-21s can grow up to six plants for personal use or possess up to an ounce without facing any penalty.

Since the laws were passed a huge industry has sprung up offering seeds and a bewildering array of products.

Cannabis-lovers can now buy THC-infused elixirs, massage oils, bath soaks and hundreds of varieties of plants with names like Ghost Train Haze and Somali Taxi Ride.

Authorities, meanwhile, have collected millions of dollars in tax.

In the first three months after shops opened on January 1 in Colorado, the state reaped $7.3million - not including licensing fees or medical marijuana, which bring the total to more than $12million.

Mr Stites told MailOnline it had been a very creative process - especially after a few 'coffees'.

'It certainly taps into a different part of your mind,' he said. 'It can release perspectives that you didn't know existed.'
