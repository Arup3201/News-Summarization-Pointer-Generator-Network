Mourning: They victims will be laid to rest at Potocari cemetery near the town of Srebrenica, eastern Bosnia, on July 11 alongside 6,066 previously-discovered victims

Despite being in a UN safe zone, the town was 
only protected by a lightly armoured Dutch peace-keeping force of 600 
men when it was attacked by  Bosnian Serb forces led by general Ratko
 Mladic.

The forces rounded up 8,000 Bosniak (Bosnian Muslim) men and boys from Srebrenica and surrounding villages, before stripping them off their clothes and possessions, executing them and burying them in mass graves.

They also forcibly transferred 25,000-30,000 women and children to Muslim areas.

So far, the remains of 6,066 people have had their
 remains exhumed from mass graves in the Srebrenica region for reburial 
in the Potocari cemetery.

Heartbreaking: The 1995 Srebrenica massacre, which took place on July 11, 1995, saw more than 8,000 Muslim men and boys executed and buried in mass graves

Praying: It took place just a few months before the end of Bosnia's 1992-1995 war, which claimed some 100,000 lives in total. Above, mourners pray beside the truck

The massacre, labelled a 'genocide' by two 
international courts, took place just a few months 
before the end of Bosnia's 1992-1995 war, which claimed some 100,000 
lives in total.

In May 2011, Mladic was arrested in Lazarevo, near Zrenjanin in the Banat region in northern Serbia, on suspicion of 11 charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity.
