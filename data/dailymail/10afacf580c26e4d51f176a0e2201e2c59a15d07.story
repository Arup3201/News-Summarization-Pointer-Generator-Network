To many, William Shakespeare could lay claim to being a genius and possibly the greatest writer of all time.

But according to one ITV boss, the Bard would have struggled to get a job writing for Coronation Street.

Soap creative director John Whiston made the remarkable statement as he defended using Shakespeare's poetry in an advert for Coronation Street and Emmerdale.

Lady Macbeth? Michelle Keegan plays Tina McIntyre in the soap, which William Shakespeare, possibly the world's greatest ever writer, would have apparently been lucky to get a job on, according to one ITV boss

He said: 'Having read a lot of his stuff, I think Shakespeare would be lucky to get a job on either of our soaps.'

Mr Whiston made the comments at a screening of an Emmerdale special in which Gennie Sharma, who is played by Sian Reese-Williams, falls to her death, according to The Mirror.

He said the channel felt it could use Shakespeare's Sonnet 18 to advertise the soaps as they were both 'at their peak'.

Corrie characters David Platt, Hayley Cropper and Rita Sullivan all read out lines of the poem, along with Emmerdale's Cain Dingle and Cameron Murray, as part of the advert.

The trailer finishes with the line: 'The greatest drama: Every day'.

Meanwhile,
the world's longest running soap is continually looking to the future -
it was announced earlier this year that Coronation Street could soon be
filming life on the Weatherfield cobbles in 3D.

In February bosses said they were planning a 'future-proof' set at its new studio at MediaCity in Salford Quays, paving the way for 3D technology to be used in special episodes.

And the show, which was first broadcast in black and white in 1960, was also named as one of the 50 most influential international TV programmes of all time in April.

The list was compiled to mark the 50th anniversary of Mip TV, a TV trade show held in Cannes each spring.

Trailer: The advert also features characters including Emmerdale's Cain Dingle (played by Jeff Hordely, pictured in the soap with Emma Etkins as Charity Sharma) reading lines from the sonnet
