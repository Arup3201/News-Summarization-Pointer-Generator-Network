It's the stuff made of many people's nightmares, but it was a reality for one Queensland homeowner last week.

A  company called Snake Catchers from Brisbane posted the series of photos on its Facebook page, which shows the carpet python, entering the bathroom through the light fixture.

It's the stuff made of many people's nightmares, but it was a reality for one Queensland homeowner when they found a snake coming through the light fixtures

Bryan from Snake Catchers says it's common for them to remove snakes from suburban homes in and around Brisbane. 

'We’ve had a few do that... if it's not entry via lighting or bathroom heaters, it's through the exhaust fans,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

'It depends on the weight of the snake, some are heavier enough to push their way through.

'These aren't rural areas either... we're talking suburban homes within a stone throw to the city.'

'In case you were thinking of leaving that cover off the bathroom light for a little longer... think again!!! You may end up with an unwanted visitor,' the company posted alongside the photos.

Hundreds of people reacted and shared their fears on the page.

'You'd wanna hope there's a toilet in that bathroom after walking in to see that - it'd be needed LOL,' Nikki Day said. 

'We are attaching all our covers,' Mark Lord followed up with. 

'Omg. That's not even funny. Our heat light is like that,' another user, Shara Feneck, posted. 

The Snake Catchers Facebook page is inundated with photos of snakes they've captured from houses in Brisbane and the surrounding areas.

It comes comes a month after a large four metre snake was found atop a bed in a home in Morayfield, north of Brisbane. 

The 'non-dangerous' carpet python was discovered slipping around underneath the bed sheets before it was reported to snake handler Julie Baker. 

Ms Baker removed the large non-venomous snake from the Morayfield home using a large hook and a canvas bag, before releasing it back on the resident's acreage.
