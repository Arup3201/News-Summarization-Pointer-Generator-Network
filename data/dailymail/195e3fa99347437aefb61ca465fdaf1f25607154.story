Twelve thrill-seekers were plucked from a high-speed rollercoaster at Universal Studios by firefighters today after a malfunction.

The 'high-speed rampage' of a ride, which hits 67mph and goes upside-down seven times, came grinding to a halt Tuesday evening after a mechanism went wrong.

Riders were left stuck on the tracks of the 16-year-old coaster, reportedly for around a quarter of an hour, while firefighters with cherry-pickers drove up to bring them down to safety.

Stuck: The ride came to a halt in the Orlando theme park around 5pm Tuesday afternoon. A cherry-picker, which was used to get passengers off, can be seen to the right

Fixing up: 12 people were removed from the ride by firefighters, some of whom can still be seen investigating above

Local news station WESH2, which captured footage of firefighters aboard the empty cars not long after 5pm, said that nobody was hurt in the incident.

Riders were left approximately 15ft off the ground while firefighters responded. 

In a statement given to the channel, Universal described the malfunction as a 'glitch', following which 'the ride did what it was supposed to do, and shut down'.

According to the Orlando Sentinel, the theme park is not yet certain what went wrong, and has launched an investigation.

The Hulk ride was built in 1999 at the Island of Adventure theme park, an expansion area which is next to the original Universal Studios, and costs a premium to enter.
