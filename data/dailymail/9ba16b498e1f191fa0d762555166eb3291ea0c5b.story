Google chairman Eric Schmidt has warned that National Security Agency spying is going to 'break the Internet' and cause countries to start their own networks to avoid foreign surveillance. 

The Silicon Valley titan spoke out at a conference organized by NSA opponent Senator Ron Wyden. He was just one of the big voices sounding an alarm about American surveillance practices. 

Representatives from Google, Microsoft, Facebook and other major tech firms say their industry stands to lose a fortune as international customers flee American technology companies over concerns that their data is being siphoned off carte blanche and analyzed by American intelligence officials.

'The simplest outcome is that we're going to end up breaking the Internet,' Schmidt said in the gymnasium of a Palo Alto, California, high school.

'Because what's going to happen is, governments will do bad laws of one kind or another, and they are eventually going to say, "We want our own Internet in our country because we want it to work our way, right? And we don't want these NSA and other people in it."

'The cost of that is huge, in terms of knowledge, discovery, science, growth, jobs, ect.' 

He also said that spying is already hurting global connectivity and trust in the Internet.

'The impact is severe and getting worse,' he warned. 

The result could see American companies cut out technology growth - no longer able to provide apps, server space, hardware or other services, to the rest of the world because of NSA spying, Schmidt said.

Sen Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, has been an outspoken critic of the NSA's spying practices and has stepped up his criticism ever since former NSA contractor Edward Snowden leaked a drove of top-secret documents. 

The internal memos revealed that intelligence services have been tapping directly into the data streams of US tech companies to mine personal information  in the name of national security.

The publication of those practices have caused many foreign customers to flee American tech services like Google and Facebook. 

'Just as people won't put their money in a bank they won't trust, people won't use an Internet they won't trust,' Microsoft General Counsel Brad Smith said.

The panelists pointed out that Germany recently ended a contract with US phone carrier Verizon because of the company's participation in the NSA surveillance program.
