Dramatic photographs released on Sunday reveal the difficult moment the father of UC Santa Barbara campus shooter Elliot Rodger met the father of one his of shooting spree victims.

Peter Rodger came face-to-face with Richard Martinez earlier this month, less than two weeks after his son, 22-year-old Elliot Rodger, shot and stabbed six students including Martinez's 20-year-old son, Christopher.

Courageous Martinez met Rodger at a Santa Barbara coffee shop on June 1. They wouldn't discuss details of what they called a 'private conversation between grieving fathers', but did say that they reached common ground.

'We plan to work together so other families such as ours will not suffer as ours have,' Martinez told the station.

Martinez has been an outspoken critic of the nation's gun laws since his 20-year-old son, Christopher Michaels-Martinez, was shot in the rampage that left five other UC San Barbara students dead. Police believe the killer took his own life after crashing his car as officers moved in.

Elliot Rodger's parents issued a statement the morning after the killings that they were "staunchly against guns" and support gun-control laws.

They said in another statement Thursday that it had been 'hell on earth' knowing their son's actions led to tragedy.

'We are crying out in pain for the victims and their families. It breaks our hearts on a level that we didn't think was possible,' Peter and Chin Rodger said in the statement.

'It is now our responsibility to do everything we can to help avoid this happening to any other family.'

Rodger killed six people between the ages of 19 and 22 on May 23 after years of what he claimed was rejection and ridicule and sexual jealousy because he was a virgin.

He took his own life after his shooting rampage and it was claimed in the days afterwards that his family had tried to get him professional help weeks before the massacre.

This comes as ABC announced that Barbara Walters will have the first interview with UC-Santa Barbara shooter Elliot Rodger's father.

Peter Rodger has not spoken out about his son's killing spree that left six dead and 13 others injured before killing himself.

The special will mark the famed broadcaster's first return to television since she retired last month.

ABC did not reveal when the interview will air, saying only that it will be an upcoming special edition of 20/20.

The killer's mother, Li-Chin Rodger, was the first one to realize that something was awry at the time of his killing spree.

Final warning: Elliot Rodger posted a confessional video titled 'Retribution' shortly before going on a killing spree near the UC-Santa Barbara campus in May

Promising: Christopher Martinez had planned to study in London for a year before starting law school

Victim: Christopher, 20, was one of six students to be killed in May's attack

Emotional: One day after his son was shot dead, Richard Martinez, center, blamed Christopher's death on 'irresponsible politicians and the NRA'

Li-Chin, who have been divorced for many years, received an email from her 22-year-old son shortly after 9pm on May 25 which included a 140-page manifesto.

She immediately went to Elliot's YouTube page and saw that he had uploaded a video called 'Retribution' wherein he describes how he plans to slaughter sorority girls.

His mother knew something was horribly wrong and she called her ex, filmmaker Peter, and after they watched the video, they called 911.

Both parents rushed to the scene separately and reportedly realized they were too late once they heard news reports of the ongoing rampage on the car radio.

Neither parent has spoken out about the killings yet, and in the immediate aftermath they gave permission to a close friend to speak to the media on their behalf, explaining how Elliot had been receiving professional help for some time.

'(His parents) were conscious and concerned about their son's health,' Simon Astaire told CNN.

'They thought he was in good hands.'

Change: Richard Martinez, who son Christopher was shot dead in May's attack, called for tougher gun laws

Richard Martinez has become a crusader for more stringent gun laws in the wake of his son's killing.

In late May, Martinez addressed a crowd of about 20,000 who gathered for the University of California Santa Barbara memorial, the crowd got to their feet and joined his chant of 'Not One More'.

Moments earlier he had given an emotional tribute to his only son, Christopher, who just before his death had been planning a year in London before starting law school.

Instead, the 20-year-old became the sixth victim to die on May 23, during a deadly rampage by a college student in Isla Vista.

Mr Martinez used the memorial on Tuesday to call for an end to gun violence, telling the crowd: 'Too many people have died, and there should be not one more,' NBC Los Angeles reported.

'How many more people are going to have to die in this situation before the problem gets solved?' he asked.

'They [politicians] have done nothing and that's why Chris died ... in my opinion,' Mr Martinez said.

'It's almost become a normal thing for us to accept [mass shootings] ... It's not normal. Life doesn't have to be like this.'

After talking of his son's love of basketball, and describing him as kind and competitive, Mr Martinez addressed lawmakers who had reached out to him after Christopher's death.

Composed: Richard Martinez also read statements from relatives of other victims, including the Hong family who called for 'Hatred to be gone with the wind'

'Don't tell me you are sorry about my son's death until you do something,' he said, according to Anderson Cooper 360.

Mr Martinez told the crowd he should not be seen as a spokesman for all the families caught up in the stabbings and shootings.

But he was asked by the families of Cheng Yuan Hong and Weihan 'David' Wang, to give statements on their behalf.

As he held a Gone With The Wind book bag aloft, Mr Martinez read a statement from the Hong family, which said: 'May we together create a peaceful world and let hatred be gone with the wind.'

The family of 20-year-old Wang have also called for tighter gun control.

In their statement read by Mr Martinez, they said: 'Our child desired a land free from fear.'

When Mr Martinez ended his speech, he called on the students gathered there to join him in his demand to end gun violence.

As he returned to his seat, the grieving father was given a standing ovation, and the crowd continued the chant 'Not one more', which he had led them in just moments before.

Mr Martinez had began his campaign just one day after his son's death, making an emotional televised appearance on Saturday.

Clutching a photo of his son, he said: 'Why did Chris die? Chris died because of craven, irresponsible politicians and the NRA.

'They talk about gun rights, but what about Chris' right to live? When will this insanity stop?'
