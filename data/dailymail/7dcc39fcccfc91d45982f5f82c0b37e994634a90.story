Samantha Cameron tried to gain access to Sarah Brown's records to copy how to be the perfect Prime Minister's wife, it has emerged.

Former No.10 spin doctor Damian McBride said David Cameron's wife wanted to use Mrs Brown's emails, diary and contacts when setting up her private office.

But the request was refused, and Gordon Brown's wife's strategy for handling her public profile remained secret.

Mr McBride writes in his explosive memoir Power Trip about his admiration for Mrs Brown, and the way she stood by Gordon when the pressure of being Prime Minister mounted.

'Over the years, I came to realise that Sarah Brown was a deeply intelligent, private person with a ferocious passion for causes and people close to her heart,' he said.

'To her, Gordon was always the star and, whatever she did to support him, it was always to enhance the story of the day — not become the story herself.'

Mr McBride went on: 'When she was 
sworn at by the PR supremo Matthew Freud for failing to deliver Gordon 
for a photo-stunt with Blair and Rupert Murdoch at Davos, she just 
shrugged — because what really mattered to her was what was best for 
Gordon and her boys.

'It was
little wonder that when the Tories came into No  10, they asked for 
access to her emails, diary and contacts book to study ‘best practice’ 
for setting up  Samantha Cameron’s private office.

'They
were refused permission. Sarah, however, will always be a tough act to 
follow, because — like Michelle Obama — with her, it was never an act.'

He has also contrasted Mrs Brown's private loyalty to her husband to Cheri Blair's love of the limelight during the long feud between Mr Brown and Tony Blair.

Recalling an incident at a party conference when just as Mr Brown was saying in a speech how great Mr Blair was, Mrs Blair shouted back: ‘Well, that’s a bloody lie.’

Mr McBride added: 'You could argue, of course, that Cherie was only showing loyalty to her husband.

'But unlike Sarah Brown — who was no less fiercely loyal to Gordon — Cherie was never happy unless her loyalty was expressed publicly, with her face all over the papers.'
