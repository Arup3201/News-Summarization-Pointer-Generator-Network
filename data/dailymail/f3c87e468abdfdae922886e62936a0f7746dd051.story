Manchester United Starlet James Wilson has revealed that Wayne Rooney outshines the likes of Angel di Maria and Radamel Falcao during training by scoring more stunning goals than any of his team-mates.

The highly-rated 18-year-old has been training with the United first team since March of this year and has gone on to make five appearances for Louis van Gaal's side this season.

And Wilson has given some insight into performances at Carrington by insisting England international Rooney is more likely to score a picture-book goal than any other player in the squad.

'It would probably be Wayne, with a volley or something,' Wilson told manutd.com. 

'The ball will drop out to him and he’ll just go for it when nobody else would think to do it and it’ll fly into the top corner.

'He can score from anywhere, outside the box or inside the box. He can score with free-kicks, penalties, volleys, headers.'

Wilson, who has also represented England at youth levels, is making the most of his involvement with the Manchester United first team by learning from experienced strikers Rooney, Falcao and Robin van Persie.

'Wayne is the captain so he’s very verbal and you can go to him for advice. You can learn things from Robin and Radamel that you probably could also learn from Wayne but it’s mostly within a game. 

'So if you do something that isn’t particularly correct in a game, they’ll tell you what you could have done instead and next time you can learn from your mistakes.'
