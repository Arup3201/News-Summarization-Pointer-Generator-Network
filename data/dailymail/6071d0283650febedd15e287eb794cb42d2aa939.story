Mel B has delayed a crucial eye operation to restore her sight

Mel B delayed a crucial eye operation to restore her sight yesterday, just a week after claims she is splitting from her husband amid rumours of physical abuse.

The X Factor judge, right, was left blind in one eye after laser surgery 15 years ago to correct her vision went wrong.

After waiting two years for a corrective procedure, the singer was due to have a corneal transplant at a Los Angeles hospital. It has now emerged the surgery has been postponed.

The singer had to undergo tests to check the transplant would work and book the specific eye surgeon she wanted.

But it has now emerged the planned surgery - which she talked about in an interview with Hello! Magazine last week – has been postponed.

The postponement comes just seven days after Mel pulled out of the X-Factor final as speculation broke out online that she had been beaten up by her husband Stephen Belafonte, 39.

The following night she appeared on the ITV show with viewers taking to the social networking site Twitter saying the singer had a ‘bruised and swollen face’ and was not wearing her wedding ring.

Belafonte denied the claims, when contacted later in the States, saying: ‘I did not hit her, this isn’t going on, that’s not going on.’

But on Thursday the controversy over Mel B’s marriage was re-ignited when her mother Andrea Brown attacked Belafonte on Twitter.

‘Little good news 4 me lost half a stone in 1 week+ will never suffer a vile abusive 3am call from stephan Belafonti again!!’ [sic] she wrote.

She later added another message, writing: ‘On average It takes 30 beatings 4 a woman to leave abusive man how sad more should b done 4 these victims!!’

In an interview with Hello! magazine this week, Mel B explained: ‘I can’t see at all out of my left eye. The lasering went wrong so this (operation) will be totally life-changing.

‘I had laser treatment done to correct (my eyes), but it started to reverse in one eye. It’s scary.

‘I’m going blind again. I had a bit of a nightmare. I was reading the autocue and then suddenly I realised that I couldn’t see properly.’

Mel, 39, pulled out of the X Factor final amid speculation she had been beaten up by husband Stephen Belafonte, which he denies

The transplant would involve doctors replacing the transparent front part of her left eye with donor tissue, under general anaesthetic.

Mel B’s publicist said yesterday: ‘She was due to have it (the operation) in LA this week.

‘Mel talked about it in the Hello! interview and said she would have the operation as soon as she got back.

‘But she hasn’t returned to LA, she’s still in the UK and she’s had to postpone the surgery for now.’

The film producer Belafonte flew back ahead of Mel B with the couple’s nanny and Mel’s daughter by Jimmy Gulzar, Phoenix, 15, last weekend.
