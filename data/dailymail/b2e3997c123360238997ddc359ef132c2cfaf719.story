Detectives have started a charity in memory of brothers Charlie and Braden Powell who were murdered by their father in February.

Police in Pierce County, Washington, created Charlie's Dinosaur, a non-profit to help foster children, after they came across a heart-warming picture of a dinosaur, drawn by seven-year-old Charlie, while cleaning out the family's storage unit.

'Having gone through that investigation, and having been very affected by it, a small group of us decided to get together,' detective Lynette Anderson told Komo News.

Charlie and his five-year-old brother Braden were murdered when their dad, Josh Powell, blew up their home, killing all three.

The organisation fills backpacks with toiletries, books, toys and other items that are donated by the public and distributes them to kids in foster homes.

They also want to provide schools supplies to disadvantaged children.

'Our goal is to provide a backpack of 
personal items for these children to help them gain a sense of comfort 
and security in owning their own clothing and hygiene supplies,' said 
the Charlieâ€™s Dinosaur Facebook page.

'Our wish is that when faced with the overwhelming emotion that comes from being removed from their normal care, that the children can maintain the dignity and reassurance of having their own complete set of clothing, personal care items, small toys and comfort items.'

Ms Anderson told Komo News that Charlie's Dinosaur was aiming to distribute a hundred backpacks every month.

Josh Powell had lost custody of his sons
after his father, whom he and the children lived with, was arrested in 
September and charged with 14 counts of voyeurism and one count of 
pornography.

Mr Powell was a person of interest in the disappearance of his wife, Susan, who he claims went missing from their Utah home in December 2009 when he and the boys were camping.

He killed Charlie and Braden in a home explosion when they were on a supervised visit.
