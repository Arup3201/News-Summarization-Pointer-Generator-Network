Shocking surveillance footage shows the moment that a man who had been shot was stepped over by customers at a convenience store.

Jheryl Wright, 31, was fatally shot in September 2012 as he left a shop in Kalamazoo, Michigan.

As Mr Wright lay dying, customers and clerks at the store ignored him for almost five minutes, some even callously stepping over his body.

Jheryl Wright, 31, was fatally shot in September 2012 as he left a shop in Kalamazoo, Michigan. As Mr Wright lay dying, customers and clerks at the store ignored him for almost five minutes, some even callously stepping over his body.

Jheryl Wright, 31, (pictured left) died in September 2012. His mother Jackel (right) is completely distraught after learning that people stepped over his son's body rather than help him as he lay dying

In the disturbing images, two men leave the store, look down at the man's body and walk on.

The store clerk peers over the counter at the shooting victim - but does nothing.

Another customer steps over the body twice as he leaves and then re-enters the store.

After about five minutes, a man comes into the shop, sees that the man is clearly seriously injured and makes a call on his cell phone.  .

The footage came to light last week during the trial of Clarence Ross who was found guilty of Mr Wright's murder. He is due to be sentenced next month. 

The victim's mother Jackel Wright, 
described the disregard for her son's life as awful and disgusting. She 
has only been told about the tape and cannot bear to watch it.

Speaking of those customers who walked over her son, Ms Wright told WWMT: 'I hope God have mercy on your soul because you was wrong, sitting there and not helping my son, like he was 
just a doormat; walking over him, laying there dead, I hope y'all can't sleep at night, 'cause that 
was awful. Just plain awful.'

Finally a customer sees that the man has been seriously injured and makes a call on his cell phone presumably to 911
