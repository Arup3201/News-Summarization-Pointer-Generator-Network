They may be able to stand the heat on the pitch, but young  stars Luke Shaw and Adnan Januzaj will no longer have to stay out of the kitchen - with Manchester United arranging for a top chef  to teach them how to cook.

According to The Sun, the club sends a chef to their homes to give them advice on diet and food preparation. 

And they could easily have taken advantage of their new-found skills on Christmas Day, after Manchester United players were given the day off by Louis van Gaal ahead of the visit of Newcastle on Boxing Day.

'Some of our players - including first team regulars like Luke Shaw and Adnan Januzaj - are in their teens and some haven't learned how to cook,' a source told The Sun.

'So we send a chef to give their fridges the once-over. The chef explains what needs throwing out, what's healthy and what's not. Then they re-stock the fridge and work on some healthy recipes.

'Most have £30,000 designer kitchens which wouldn't be out of place in Michelin-starred restaurants but some can barely use a microwave let alone an oven.'

Shaw's Manchester United career has been blighted by injury thus far, as he has managed just seven Premier League games since joining the club for £30million during the summer.

His most recent start came during the club's 2-1 victory over Arsenal at the Emirates stadium last month, although he managed just 16 minutes of that game before being forced off through injury.

And he is set to miss out again when Newcastle visit Old Trafford on Boxing Day.

Januzaj, meanwhile, has struggled to make an impact so far this campaign after such an impressive debut season under David Moyes.

The youngster is out of favour with Van Gaal, and could be set to leave the club on loan in January, with French champions Paris Saint-Germain among those interested to take him on loan.

His last appearance for United was on December 2 against Stoke City at Old Trafford, and with the club not in Europe this season, Januzaj would be eligible to play in the Champions League, while Premier League clubs such as Everton and Hull are also keen.
