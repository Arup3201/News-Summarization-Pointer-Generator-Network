Stephanie Mack has revealed that she was so overcome
with emotion that she threw up the first time she went back into the home where
her husband killed himself.

The widow of Mark Madoff said that she was also horrified to
still see the marks left by the dog leash on one of the beams which he used in
the hanging.

Miss Mack said that she never intended to go back to
the apartment in Manhattan, New York, but did so along with their two children to give
them some ‘normalcy’.

In an interview she also revealed that for the first time
she is thinking about forgiving Bernie Madoff having previously said she would
‘spit in his face’ if she saw him again.

Miss Mack had vowed she would never set foot in her old
apartment in Manhattan after Mark’s suicide in 2010.

He and his brother Andrew were the ones who turned in their
father in late 2008 over his £41 billion Ponzi scheme.

He is now serving 150 years in jail for his crimes but the
fallout on his family has been even more devastating - with Mark unable to cope
with the pressure.

Speaking to Harper’s Bazaar, Miss Mack, 37, said that
she decided to return to the SoHo loft with Audrey, five, Nicholas, three and
her own parents.

She said: ‘I thought, you know, I need to bring, like,
normalcy back to their life? But when I got home and walked in the door, I threw up.’

Miss Mack had hired a builder to ‘cover up’ the steel
beam from which Mark hanged himself but unfortunately she could still see the
‘scuff marks on the ceiling’.

She said: ‘I mean, this is so gruesome, like, I guess from
hanging the dog leash over the thing.

'I don't know. And then the floor, from a
certain area, was really scratched up. I tried to figure out some clues and
stuff.’

Now living in a rented apartment in the Tribeca area of
Manhattan with her children, Miss Mack opened up about how Mark’s death
had affected them.

She said they don’t talk about ‘Grandpa Bernie’ too much and
when asked about their father they say: ‘Daddy got a boo-boo on his brain that
made his heart stop.’

But more than a year after her husband’s death, Miss Mack  said that she was only now entertaining the idea of forgiveness.

She said that in her gym class her instructor was talking
about how ‘if you don't have forgiveness, you're stuck’.

She said: ‘I'm not going to be stuck. I'm going to move forward.
I'm not going to let Bernie Madoff ruin my life anymore.’

Last year Miss Mack gave an interview to ABC News in
which she said that if she saw Bernie she’d tell him ‘that I hold him
fully responsible for killing my husband, and I’d spit in his face’.

'I thought, you know, I need to bring, like, normalcy back to their life? But when I got home and walked in the door, I threw up'

She also wrote a bitter memoir titled ‘The End Of Normal: A
Wife’s Anguish, A Widow’s New Life’ in which she talked of how she coped with
the public humiliation of being part of America’s most notorious family.

The book detailed how Bernie once eyed up her bottom
when she was pregnant with his grandchild and made crude jokes about how big it
was.

Miss Mack also said that his wife Ruth was such a diet
freak she poured copious amounts of salt on food to stop her eating any more
than she deemed sufficient.

She is now calling herself 'Mack' as opposed to her former 'Madoff Mack' because she wants to avoid the hassle people give her.

'It just sucked to, like, pick up a prescription at the pharmacy and have someone say something,' she said.

'I don't feel ashamed anymore, but I don't want to have to hear it.'

She chose the name Mack because of the M from Madoff and 'ACK', which is the airport code for Nantucket, the Massachusetts town where she and Mark loved spending time together.

She told People magazine last October she felt ‘betrayed’ by Bernie and has not forgiven Ruth, or her husband’s brother Andrew, for allegedly abandoning Mark.

Her late husband relentlessly followed news coverage about his father and failed in a 2009 suicide attempt, leaving a note saying his life was 'destroyed' and telling his dad: ‘F**k you’, she added.

She told ABC that her daughter Audrey sometimes shouts ‘I love you, daddy!’ in the sky and recently asked her: ‘Why didn’t daddy take his cell phone with him when he died?’, reported People magazine.

The couple wed in 2004 after meeting on a blind date when Miss Mack worked in fashion and Mark worked in finance. But she said his ‘handsome face aged overnight’ when Bernie was jailed.

‘The smile that made me fall in love with him disappeared altogether,’ she wrote in her book, adding that Mark would obsessively follow news reports in fear of being implicated in the scandal.
