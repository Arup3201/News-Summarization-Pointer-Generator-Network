More than two dozen British holidaymakers are seeking compensation from a UK tour operator after claiming they contracted nasty stomach bugs or skin rashes at a Portuguese resort.

The tourists say they were swept up in outbreaks of gastric illnesses that occurred over the spring and summer months at Holiday Village Algarve.

Young children were among those who fell ill with symptoms including diarrhoea, stomach aches or fever during their stay at the all-inclusive First Choice hotel.

Holidaymakers claim that the hotel’s cleaning standards were poor and there was mould around placemats in its restaurants, food was left out and diners’ tables were swarmed by birds.

Sarah Andrews, 34, from Derby, said her family’s relaxing holiday was ruined when she, her 35-year-old husband Robert and their two children came down with symptoms of illness or rashes.

Her two-year-old son suffered from diarrhoea, stomach aches and a high temperature at the hotel, and the illness continued once the family returned home.

He was taken to a local GP for tests but his condition worsened and he had to be admitted to Royal Derby Hospital.

While in hospital the young boy was isolated and became anaemic.

Doctors confirmed he contracted gastroenteritis, an inflammation of the stomach or bowels.

Mrs Andrews said: ‘It was awful. It was horrible to see my two-year-old in such a lot of pain. It was heart-breaking.

‘You could hear people being ill when you walked down the hotel corridor. You could hear babies screaming, clearly being quite violently sick.’

She said the hotel’s cleaning standards were ‘appalling’ and its manager and staff denied that there was an outbreak of illness.

Mrs Andrews said a worker reused the same mop and failed to use disinfectant on the floor after her six-year-old daughter became sick in their hotel room.

The tables were scrubbed and the placemats were replaced after someone complained about the mould, she added.

Both Mr Andrews and the couple’s daughter were also affected by a skin condition thought to be caused by a hotel swimming pool.

They were prescribed antibiotics and antihistamines once they returned to the UK.

Reports of illness first surfaced last May at the resort in southern Portugal.

Guests, who have hired Your Holiday Claims, a division of Farnworth Rose in Lancashire, have described queues of people waiting to complete sickness forms after falling ill at the hotel, according to the law firm.

Debbie Middleton said she and her children were affected by similar symptoms during their time at the resort in Olhos de Agua.

Her baby daughter continued to experience symptoms after they returned home.

Farnworth Rose said it has been contacted by 28 holidaymakers to pursue claims for compensation against First Choice.

Mrs Andrews said she is hoping the claims will lead to changes at the resort.

She said: ‘It would be nice if when you arrive on a holiday and there is an illness there that they let you know when you get there.’

In a statement, First Choice said it is 'sorry to hear that a small number of customers have reported that they were unwell at the Holiday Village Algarve in May'.

The tour operator added: 'We closely audit all the resorts to which we operate to ensure that health, hygiene and comfort levels are maintained in line with industry standards.

'We would like to reassure customers that this hotel remains very popular and 96 per cent of customers who stayed there in May rated their holiday experience as either good or excellent.

'As this case is now subject to legal proceedings it would be inappropriate for us to comment further.' 

Anne Thomson, Head of Travel Law at Your Holiday Claims, said: ‘A number of visitors to the hotel have reported suffering gastric illness and skin infections during their holidays, with many requiring medical attention due to the severity of their symptoms.

‘It is vital that the highest standards of hygiene within restaurants are always maintained in order to protect the health of holidaymakers. In this case, many visitors to the hotel feel that that they have been let down in this respect.

‘I hope that such reports from holidaymakers falling ill are fully investigated by their tour operator in order to prevent any further spread of infection.’
