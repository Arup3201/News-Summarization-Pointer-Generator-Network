A Bulgarian man who was won the National Lottery - twice - has an illegal cabin in the back garden of his home that he rents out for as much as £10,000 a year, it has been reported.

George Traykov, 46, a former member of the Bulgarian skydiving team, beat odds of one-in-438 million when he picked up a £160,873 EuroMillions prize in March to add to the £1million sum he won in the Millionaire Raffle in September 2011.

Now a home he owns in Harrow, north-west London, has been investigated by council staff after the cabin - which has a kitchen, toilet and bedroom - was discovered.

The scourge of these often rickety, cramped and unhygienic buildings looks set to grow as the country struggles to accommodate the huge numbers of immigrants arriving here – both legally and illegally.

It was detected after officials used an aircraft equipped with a thermal camera to fly over the borough to pinpoint the illegal structures.

'The beds-in-sheds phenomenon means there
 is a hidden community springing up in the back gardens of our cities - 
in our borough alone the thermal pictures we receive suggest there are 
four times as many as we first suspected,' said Susan Hall, the 
Conservative leader of Harrow council.

'The pressures of migration in London, fuelled by recent waves of new arrivals from eastern Europe, are creating new stresses on local authorities that we just haven't had to contend with before.

'What was once thought, even just 18 months ago, to be a problem for the centre of big cities is now rippling out to the suburbs.'

She added: 'These are people who use council services - like bin collection - but for whom we receive no extra funding.

'In many cases the people in beds in sheds are at the bottom of a pyramid of exploitation. But we get complaints from their neighbours that we cannot ignore, and it is not fair on them that these houses should turn into cash cows for opportunist landlords.'

Earlier this year, Ealing Council estimated that the inhabitants of beds in sheds has pushed the area’s population up by 60,000 to nearly 400,000.

Mr Traykov, who is believed to be travelling through Europe, was contacted by the Sunday Telegraph but was not available to comment.

Speaking at the time of his win, the property developer, who has lived in the UK for 20 years,  said: 'I've always worked very hard and never spent more than I have so money has never been a major problem for me.'

The house itself has been divided into four separate rooms, one of which is rented by Polish special educational needs teacher Agnieszka Klojzy, who lives in it with her two children, aged five and two.

She said: 'George is a good landlord. He looks after us quite well. It was scary [when the council came]. I felt like a criminal.'

A neighbour, who did not wish to be identified, said a lot of people go to and from the property and claimed a fence was installed to hide the structure in the garden.

Harrow council served Mr Traykov with two planning enforcement notices.

In a statement, the council said: 'There is a national yardstick for what constitutes a licensable HMO [House in Multiple Occupation]. In Harrow, the rule is that a building has to be at least two storeys and have four unrelated people living there.

'Courtenay Avenue was clearly licensable and was not. The outbuilding constituted a breach of planning because it had no planning consent to be constructed, especially as it was equipped for stand-alone living - i.e. kitchen, lavatory, bedroom etc.

'In November Harrow Council served a 
planning enforcement notice with two elements.

'One required the beds in 
sheds outbuilding to be demolished while the other part required the 
main building to be returned to a family dwelling.

'The notice should 
have taken effect from December 12th with a six-month deadline, but has 
been frozen because the landlord has appealed.'
