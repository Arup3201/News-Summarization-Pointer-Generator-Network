Alf-Inge Haaland has dismissed Roy Keane's latest comments in their long-running feud and mocked the Irishman's beard by comparing him to Saddam Hussein.

Keane re-ignited the issue in his new autobiography The Second Half, having admitted in the first book that he deliberately set out to injure Haaland during a Manchester derby at Old Trafford in 2001.

'There are things I regret in my life and he's not one of them,' wrote Keane.

Asked what he thought of the comments by his former Norway teammate Egil Ostenstad on Twitter, Haaland posted a picture of a bearded Saddam shortly after his capture in 2003 with the message: 'cant take a man seriously when hes got a beard like....'

The tweet was later deleted but the former Manchester City and Leeds defender posted another message on Tuesday joking that the former Iraqi tyrant’s family would not want him to be connected to Keane.

He wrote: ‘Sorry for deleting my tweet last night. I had to. SH’s family did not want to be associated with your former leader.’

Haaland also gave a statement to TV2 in Norway, saying: ‘I haven’t actually said anything. I just said that I don’t take his comments seriously. There’s no use getting on your high horse and saying that everybody else is an idiot if they don’t agree with you.’

The feud goes back to a game between Manchester United and Leeds in 1997 when Keane ruptured the anterior cruciate ligament in his knee in a tackle with Haaland who stood over his opponent and accused him of faking the injury.

The United captain exacted brutal revenge four years later with a horror tackle on Haaland, launching into a high tackle on the Norwegian's right knee. He was sent off and handed a three-match ban and a £5,000 fine.

Writing in his first book in 2002, Keane said: 'I'd waited long enough. I f****** hit him hard. The ball was there (I think). Take that you c***.

'And don't ever stand over me sneering about fake injuries. Even in the dressing room afterwards, I had no remorse. My attitude was, f*** him. What goes around, comes around. He got his just rewards. He f***** me over and my attitude is an eye for an eye.'

Keane's shocking revelations led to an FA enquiry and he was banned for an additional five games and fined a further £150,000.

Haaland never played another full match and quit the game in July 2003 at the age of 31. He launched a £6million legal action against Keane following his rival's admission but that was dropped when he accepted that he had been forced to retire because of problems in his other knee.

Speaking recently about his rift with Keane, who is now assistant manager at Aston Villa, Haaland said: 'He has never apologised and if he doesn't want to apologise, that's up to him. I don't expect him to say sorry. He's not exactly Nelson Mandela. It seems that this is the way he wants it. I can't get my career back.

'I don't think him talking about it is going to change much. I'm not expecting anything. It's not like I'm not sleeping at night.

'Maybe he wants to show that he is still a hard man. If that's how he wants to be, that's up to him.

'It's not good to talk like this, just like in his book, for kids who grow up hearing this stuff from him. I hope he realises that he has more responsibility now as assistant manager.'
