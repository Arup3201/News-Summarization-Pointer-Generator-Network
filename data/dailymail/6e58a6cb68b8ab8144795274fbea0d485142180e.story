Louis van Gaal will not rush to bring new players in before he assesses his current squad first.

The Manchester United manager makes his Premier League debut at Old Trafford against Swansea City on Saturday,and will use it to make judgements on whether he needs to bring in new faces.

And the former Netherlands boss insists he will only turn to the transfer market if he feels it is necessary to do so.

'I know I already have a good team and I am very pleased with the squad,' Van Gaal told United's official website.

'I still have more assessing to do but I don't buy players for buying players' sake. I buy players to improve my selection.

'The fans were fantastic (against Valencia). It gave me goosebumps when everyone was singing my name. 

'I want to assess my team and I can only judge when I am the trainer-coach. And I transfer my philosophy and I know how they perform my philosophy. That is what I am doing.

'Not only with the players that have trained and played football in the United States, but now I give these other players a chance for two weeks. I think that is honest. Then we have to wait and wait. You can buy a player in 24 hours, believe me. That is not a problem.

'I could discuss this (specific targets) with you but I won't do that. I will discuss it with Ed Woodward, not with you.'
