Daniel Sturridge's place in the England squad to face Switzerland is in doubt after he picked up a thigh injury during training on Friday.

Roy Hodgson's men begin their European Championship qualifying campaign in Basle on Monday against the side ranked ninth in the world.

It is a match they may well be without Sturridge for after the striker sustained a knock in training at St George's Park on Friday morning.

Blow: Daniel Sturridge picked up a knock during England training at St George's Park

Waiting game: Sturridge will have a scan before being assessed by England medics

Striker light: If Sturridge is ruled out, Wayne Rooney (L) may have to lead the line on his own

A post via the team's official Twitter account, @england, said: 'Daniel Sturridge felt an injury in training this morning and will go for a scan this afternoon. He will then be assessed by England medics.'

Sturridge's absence could see his Liverpool teammate play in the No 10 role supporting Wayne Rooney as the main striker. 

Gary Cahill was the only absentee as England continued preparations at St George's Park after the Chelsea defender aggravated a sore ankle during the 1-0 win against Norway on Wednesday.

Hodgson expects Cahill to return to the group on Saturday and be fit to face the Swiss after already having  lost two of his original 22-man squad to injuries.

Jack Colback returned to Newcastle having failed to recover from a kick on the ankle suffered against Crystal Palace, and Ben Foster has pulled out with a thumb problem.
