Christmas is a time for indulgence – but a coffee with 600 calories, 19 teaspoons of sugar and 27 grams of fat might be taking things a bit far.

Still, Costa’s sticky toffee latte has certainly proved popular, with the coffee chain selling 100,000 a week during the festive season. 

The drink contains a heady mix of espresso, steamed milk and sticky toffee sauce, and is topped with cream and – what else? – more toffee.

If made with full-fat milk, the largest ‘massimo’ size has around 598 calories, more than a quarter of a woman’s 2,000 recommended calories a day. 

It contains up to 75g of sugar – nearly 19 teaspoons, or twice the amount in a can of Coke.

The smallest ‘primo’ size, if made with skimmed milk, has 266 calories.

Costa says it sells a range of festive drinks including low-calorie hot spiced apple juice. But nutritionists said the latte’s success was part of a worrying trend.

Costa’s brownie hot chocolate has up to 654 calories for the 568ml ‘massimo’ – compared with a modest 12 calories in a black Americano coffee the same size.

Rival store Starbucks has a ‘venti’-sized honey and almond hot chocolate with whipped cream and whole milk, at 642 calories, while its toffee nut latte with whipped cream contains 467 calories.

Starbucks also sells festive themed drinks such as an eggnog latte (left) which contains 351 calories in the smallest size. Right, a coffee topped with whipped cream and chocolate

With a quarter of the population thought to be obese, National Obesity Forum spokesman Tam Fry said: ‘I find it amazing that Costa is turning out this stuff.’

‘Sticky Toffee Latte’ from Costa is made with espresso coffee, steam milk, sticky toffee sauce and is topped with cream and sticky toffee sauce.

In a ‘massimo’ 560ml cup of sticky toffee latte with full fat milk there are 598 calories, 26.6g fat, 16.7 of saturated fat, 76.7g carbohydrate, 74.8g sugar, and 460mg salt.

The smallest ‘primo’ size with skimmed milk contains 266 calories, 8.4g of fat, 5.3g of saturated fat, 414.1g carbohydrate, 40.1g of sugar, and 234mg of salt.

But he added: ‘They wouldn’t be doing it unless there was demand and that speaks volumes for how people are failing to understand how many calories and how much sugar goes into stuff they drink.’

'But if the people don’t demand it, Costa wouldn’t make it.’ 

Costa said: ‘The Christmas season is the perfect opportunity for us to showcase some of our most innovative and festive drinks.

‘Costa has created a menu for a variety of tastes. From lower-calorie praline cappuccinos to our hot spiced apple winter warmer, we’ve got something for everyone.

'Customers can also personalise their drink by opting for skimmed milk or sugar-free syrups. The Christmas range wouldn’t be in-store without customers’ stamp of approval.’
