Paul Walker's family toured a famous Los Angeles cemetery Wednesday, looking for the perfect place to lay their loved one to rest.

Eleven days after he was killed when the Porsche he was in crashed and burned in Santa Clarita, Walker's father, Paul Walker Sr., brother, Cody Walker, 25, and other family members arrived at Forest Lawn Cemetery to finalize plans for the actor's funeral service, which is reportedly going to be small.

They also walked around the grounds of the cemetery, choosing a grave site plot.

Private service: His family are expected to mourn the star in a very private ceremony for mainly relatives, though certain cast and crew from the 'Fast & Furious' movies will be invited also

According to RadarOnline, Walker's remains are already at the cemetery and will be cremated.

His family is expected to mourn the star in a very private service mainly for relatives, though TMZ reports certain cast and crew from the 'Fast & Furious' movies will be invited also as he considered them kin.

The Walkers are keen, however, to avoid throngs of media and fans. It's not known when the service will be held.

The news comes after the family claimed plastic road markers may have been responsible for the crash that killed him.

The Fast And Furious actor's relatives have reportedly spoken to stunt experts who claimed the 2005 Porsche Carrera GT driven by the star's friend careered out of control after hitting the markers - called Botts' Dots.

Small service: Eleven days after he was killed when the Porsche he was in crashed and burned in Santa Clarita, the family were together planning the small service

According to TMZ,
sources close to his family said that having visited the site, the 
experts claimed the bumps may have caused the car to hydroplane, 
resulting in the driver losing control.

Walker and driver Roger Rodas died on November 30 when their car hit a pole and tree and caught fire in the Los Angeles suburb.

The
experts told the family that the car could have lost traction after 
hitting the bumps, which are used to separate lanes of traffic, and 
skidded off the road.

The claims come after question marks were raised over the safety of the car itself following the crash.

The Porsche was being driven by the Hollywood star's friend and business partner Rodas.

It has since emerged that car experts have long expressed concern about the souped-up model's suitability for the road, due to its ultra light carbon-fibre frame and 5.7 litre race-derived V10 engine.

It has a flat out speed of 205 miles per hour and its design is derived from earlier Porsche Le Mans models.

Porsche knew of the car's sensitivity 
when they launched the model in 2004.

According to TMZ, a memo 
circulated to sales staff said of the GT Carrera: 'This vehicle cannot 
drive over a Foster Beer can that is lying on its side.'

'You need to be aware of what type of road surface you are on (dips; pot holes, seam heights, etc.)

'The Carrera GT is as close to a racecar as we will ever get, this car has all the disadvantages of a racecar.

The actor's family claims that experts say the crash could have been caused by Botts' Dots in the road - raised plastic markers that separate traffic lanes

Police have revealed that a second man
has been charged with stealing a piece of the wreckage of the Porsche 
that Walker was a passenger in when he was killed.

Anthony Janow, 25, was released on $60,000 bail following the charges.

 According to the California Department of Transportation, Botts' Dots were invented by Dr Elbert D Botts as a way of making the painted lines that separate lanes in the road last longer.

The plastic raised bumps were eventually made mandatory in California and have since become popular on roads across the world.

There are 20million Botts' Dots on Californian roads.

The dots also alert drivers when they drift out of their lane.

Prosecutors say that Janow and 18-year-old Jameson Witty stole a roof panel from the wreck as it was being towed away from the site.

The pair could face up to four-and-a-half years in prison for the offence.

Witty, who is also free on bail, was caught on video stealing the T-top roof of the Porsche right off the tow truck and afterwards he even bragged about the heist by posting pics of the stolen wreckage on Instagram.

The wrecked Porsche Carrera GT was being hauled by a flat-bed tow truck hours after the wreck that claimed the movie star and friend Roger Rodas, who was driving the vehicle when it crashed.

The tow truck stopped at a red light and a male jumped out of a car following it to grab a piece of the car – he then hopped back into his car and sped away, according to police.

The tow truck driver immediately reported the theft.

A search warrant was executed on Thursday, and police found the stolen car panel - a part from the sports car's roof.

Witty has since taken to Instagram to apologize for his actions. 'I wanted to say my intensions for the piece I took off the two truck were to make a memorial out of it. Paul was a childhood idol to me and many.

The investigation into the crash that killed both Walker and Rodas is still ongoing.
