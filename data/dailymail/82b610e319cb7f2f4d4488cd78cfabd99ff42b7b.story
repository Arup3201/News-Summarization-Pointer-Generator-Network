A World War II vet would like to pay his taxes but the IRS insists he'd dead.

Ohio man Siegfried Meinstein says that despite multiple attempts to convince the federal agency that he is, in fact, among the living, he has been unable to get someone to believe him.

The 94-year-old lives in an assisted living facility not far from Columbus.

'It isn’t really a problem in my daily life,' he told reporters. 'Everybody accepts my money.' 

Fox News reports that his family has given him good-humored teasing about it.

'If they keep insisting, what is it you say?' said his son, Ron Meinstein. 'Eventually, they’ll be right.'

In April, Meinstein attempted to file a tax return online but the IRS rejected it saying he was deceased.

A few days later he visited a Social Security office in Columbus which told them that they did not list him as a dead man, and gave him a letter to send to the IRS. The tax agency ended up sending it back to Social Security.

'We are unable to process your tax return. Our records indicate that the person identified as the primary taxpayer…was deceased prior the tax year show on the tax form,' the IRS noted on a letter responding to Meinstein.

The IRS has told journalists that their people get information from the office of Social Security and that that was the best venue to reach an understanding. 

They've also sent Meinstein a letter curious as to why he prepaid $14,000 in taxes in 2014, and telling him that they'd lost his latest tax return.
