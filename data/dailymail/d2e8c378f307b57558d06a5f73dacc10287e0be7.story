Finding good-quality snow all year round is near impossible for most skiers.

But Marco Tomasello has found a novel way around the issue.

The 36-year-old Italian, a self-described 'free-rider', has taken to speedily descending the powdered volcanic ash slopes of Mount Etna on skis, rather than waiting for winter to come.

Marco Tomasello uploaded the footage to his Vimeo account on Monday and the footage has since gone viral, already garnering some 50,000 views from stunned viewers

Mr Tomasello works as a ski instructor at Les Trois Vallées in France, but in the summer acts as a tour guide on the 3,350-metre-high Mount Etna in Sicily.

However, during his down time he and his friends take to the mountain to ski down the slopes.

Using a camera strapped to his head, Mr Tomasello is shown slaloming his way through the dark ash, which appears to look like powdered snow.

Mount Etna erupts on a regular basis, ranging from explosions on the summit to smaller eruptions on the side of the mountain.

Because of the frequency of eruptions – on average once every 1.7 years, but every year (excluding 2007) since 2001 – the volcano’s height is always fluctuating.

The notorious Italian island's volcano erupted in spectacular fashion in August.

A handful of other adrenaline junkies have also taken advantage of the powder-like ash.

Mr Tomasello's footage shows the skiers, wearing full snowsuits and gloves, carving down the volcano.

As well as skiing in more unusual places, Mr Tomasello also enjoys more traditional locations such as Niseko, Gulmarg, Alta, Lofoten, Telluride and Chamonix.

His said his favourite moments have been skiing down the Yotei volcano in Japan, skiing in Kashmir in India and in Utah, US. He also enjoys skiing in Lofoten, Norway. 

During his free time his other hobbies include downhill bike riding, surfing and travelling.

He explained that he now wants to go skiing in Lebanon and Iran, and that his ultimate place to ski is Alaska.
