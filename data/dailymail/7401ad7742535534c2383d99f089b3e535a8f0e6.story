As career moves go, they don’t come any more extreme than swapping Barnsley for Panathinaikos. From Yorkshire grit to Ancient Greece.

Sitting in his seaside apartment in the upmarket Athens suburb of Glyfada, Luke Steele has had time to reflect on the dramatic switch that took him to the Apostolos Nikolaidis Stadium in the summer after six years at Oakwell.

‘It’s the biggest change I’ve had in my life,’ says the former Manchester United and England Under 21 goalkeeper ‘There’s all the culture surrounding the place — and I live by the sea, so it’s drastically different from the streets of Yorkshire. People ask how I’ve adapted but it’s not like I’ve gone to Mars.

‘I didn’t have any regrets staying that long but I needed to be put out of my comfort zone. This is a new life and a new beginning. The adventure really appealed to me, being thrown in the deep end.

‘It’s a short career and I’m just about at the halfway point. I really want to achieve things in football, not just plod along and see it out.

‘If I really wanted to kick on and reach the places I’ve dreamed of, like playing in the top leagues or in Europe, I needed to change completely.’

A clause in his contract meant that Steele could leave on a free transfer when Barnsley were relegated last season. There were two opportunities to join bigger Championship clubs but the 30-year-old had caught the eye of Nikos Dabizas, the former Newcastle defender who is now technical director at Panathinaikos.

The 20-time Greek champions were offering a two-year contract and the lure of European football.

‘He said he wanted to meet me face to face in London,’ recalls Steele. ‘It’s a Greek thing. They like to look you in the eye and make sure you’re up to the job. Apparently I passed the eye test.’

The Peterborough-born keeper has not been afraid to make bold decisions before. Steele played under Fabien Barthez and Edwin van der Sar during four years at United, and was an FA Youth Cup winner in 2003, but he left Old Trafford for West Brom in search of first-team football.

‘I didn’t expect to be here,’ says Steele, who shot to prominence when he starred in Barnsley’s FA Cup wins over Liverpool and Chelsea in 2008 after signing from Albion on loan.

‘I didn’t set out to sign for Panathinaikos, but I made the decision pretty quickly.

‘I thought that it wouldn’t happen but the move was agreed at 10pm and I was on the 8.30am flight from Manchester the next day.

‘This felt right, especially the attraction of playing in Champions League qualifiers. We ended up in the Europa League but European football was huge for me.’

Steele admits he was a little naive about the move but was given a crash course in the passion of Greek fans during a pre-season ‘friendly’ at lower league Panegialios.

‘I couldn’t believe it,’ he says. ‘I thought there would be two or three hundred and there were thousands. It was like they’d just been let out of prison for their first football match. I absolutely loved it.

‘There were fireworks and smoke bombs — and this was a pre-season friendly. I came on in the second half and I was jumping around because firecrackers were going off behind me.

‘That got blown out of the water when I went to the Panathinaikos stadium and saw our fans for the first time. You’ve got Gate 13 who are the fanatics. They’re behind one of the goals like a hive of bees. The noise, the smoke bombs, the fireworks. It’s absolutely electric.’

That was Steele’s league debut, a 1-0 win over Niki Volos in September. Four days earlier, he played his first competitive game on his 30th birthday in a Greek Cup-tie against Olympiacos Volos, not to be confused with his club’s bitter Athens rivals Olympiacos.

Games between the teams are known rather dramatically as the Derby of Eternal Enemies, and the exaggeration is only slight. This is one of the most hostile encounters in football. Away supporters are now banned but that did not stop Panathinaikos fans setting fire to their own stadium two years ago.

In March, their coach Yannis Anastasiou was floored by an object thrown by the home fans at Olympiacos’ Karaiskakis Stadium — which hosts the first derby of this season a week on Sunday.

‘I’ve been told it’s on a different planet,’ says Steele. ‘I’ve seen some crazy footage and heard of police getting involved in the dressing rooms. I’ve played in big games but this might be a bit different.’

Steele believes his Greek adventure could open the door to a move to the Premier League, and has not abandoned hope of a senior England call-up after representing his country at every age-group.

‘I’ll be 31 by the time I finish here and, being realistic, I can play for 10 more years,’ he says. ‘I never think my chance has gone.’

Meantime, will he be taking in much of Ancient Greece? ‘My advice is go to the Acropolis but go once. That’s enough. It’s one of the oldest buildings in the world and I did love each of the 45 minutes I was there, but I’m not going to be getting a degree in Greek history.

‘For me, it’s pretty much sand, sea, crazy football fans and Panathinaikos.’
