Presenter Susanna Reid drew just over half of the audience of her old BBC colleagues when she launched ITV’s new breakfast show, Good Morning Britain, according to overnight figures.

The programme, which began broadcasting yesterday, had an average audience of 800,000 viewers while Reid’s old show, BBC Breakfast, pulled in 1.5million.

The launch of GMB was also markedly down on the first-morning figure for its predecessor, Daybreak, which pulled in one million viewers when it began in 2010.

ITV chiefs can draw some comfort from the new show proving more popular than the audience levels of around 600,000, which axed Daybreak had recently been achieving in recent months.

Yesterday’s Good Morning Britain launch peaked at 1.2million viewers.

But its distance behind BBC Breakfast is marked, and even more so when analysing 
audience reach, which adds up the total number of people watching at any
 time during the broadcast for at least three minutes.

For BBC Breakfast, the reach is 6.81million, for Good Morning Britain it's 3.08million.

On Daybreak, which ended last week, it was 2.32million.

In terms of audience share, Breakfast got 35 per cent of viewers yesterday and Good Morning Britain 18 per cent.

What's more, Breakfast's peak number of viewers on the day Good Morning Britain launched was higher than its peak the previous Monday.

Reid was the big signing to launch the new show after being lured from the BBC, where she had proved to be a popular figure. Her profile increased hugely late last year in the wake of her appearances on last year’s Strictly Come Dancing.

Reid - who wore a dazzling red dress for launch day - has been joined on the weekday ITV show by Ben Shephard, Charlotte Hawkins and Sean Fletcher.

For viewers, one of the biggest changes to predecessor Daybreak - along with the presenting team - was the introduction of a glass desk at which the hosts were seated for much of the show, although they moved to sofas later in the show.

Twitter storm: Many people took to social media sites to voice their discontent about Good Morning Britain looking similar to Good Morning America

Many observers have interpreted the discussions around the desk as more of a US-style approach, taking its cue from ABC’s popular Good Morning America.

Viewers were divided on the show, with some lamenting the passing of its predecessor while others praised its fast pace and gloss.

The programme also featured Andi Peters presenting a regular ‘Wheel Of Cash’ competition slot from a different location each day, inviting the public to win prizes.

Helen Warner, ITV’s director of daytime, was pleased with the performance and said: ‘The launch was a fantastic team effort, and we are focused on building a strong breakfast brand going forward.’

Media commentator Steve Hewlett believes it stands a fighting chance of succeeding, not least because of its poaching of Ms Reid from Breakfast.

He told MailOnline: 'This is a major throw of the dice - there's a new production team and new presenters. It's a major move, but on paper it stands every chance of working. Susanna Reid is a great booking.

'The question is whether Good Morning Britain gets to know its audience and whether it gets the right tone.'

Mr Hewlett said that arrogance was the cause of Daybreak's failure.

He said: 'With Daybreak corporate hubris took over at ITV. In one fell swoop they demonstrated everything that can go wrong in one show. They hired Adrian Chiles and Christine Bleakley, an amazing partnership on The One Show, but transplanting chemistry from one place to another is very hard to do.'

He added: 'It would be really good, not least for the BBC, if ITV manage to make a success of Good Morning Britain, because if it gets traction the BBC will be forced to react. Not having competition is not good for the viewer.'

Ms Reid’s ITV debut initially drew mixed reactions, with criticism that the show looked too similar to its U.S counterpart and that Ms Reid’s figure was obscured by a desk.

As the show began viewers took to Twitter to complain that the legs of the 43-year-old - whose pay for the role has been reported as £400,000 and as much as £1million a year - were hidden from view.

One viewer commented: 'Why has ITV paid so much for @susannareid100 only to put her behind a desk? Its like buying a Ferrari and keeping it in the garage #gmb.'

Another wrote: 'You don't hire Susanna Reid and then stick her behind a desk #getyourpinsout #GoodMorningBritain.'

The dismay was short-lived, though, as Ms Reid, dressed in a knee-length red dress, soon moved to a sofa.

Speaking recently about the desk and the new set of the show, Susanna said: 'Our set is different, fresh and it's not what people have been used to over the last couple of years in breakfast television. 'It is something new and exciting for us. We all start behind the desk, which hasn't happened for a while.'

Sky News anchor Kay Burley told MailOnline that she found the show too frantic.

The presenter, who was a reporter on Good Morning Britain's distant cousin, TV-am, in 1985, said: ‘The show itself is just too busy for me at the moment but I'm sure it'll settle down after a couple of weeks.

‘Breakfast viewers just need to know that the world is still turning, they can get to work on time and what the weather is doing...'But she added: ‘I love Susanna. I think she has all the ingredients a great presenter needs. Smart, presentable, serious when she needs to be and fun when she doesn't.’
