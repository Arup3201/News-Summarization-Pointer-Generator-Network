Eddie Ray Routh shot dead Navy SEAL sniper Chris Kyle and his friend because he thought they were pig-human hybrids who were going to assassinate him, a mental health expert has testified.

On Thursday, Mitchell H. Dunn, a forensic psychiatrist for the defense, testified in Routh's murder trial in Stephenville, Texas that the former Marine had shown 'significant signs of psychosis' before the killings at a shooting range in February 2013.

Routh feared pig-human hybrids were taking over the world - and when he climbed into Kyle's car on the day of the shootings, he feared they were also pigs, Dunn said.

He believed he was climbing inside the vehicle for a 'one-way trip', the court heard.

His fear intensified when the men did not speak to him in the car and when Kyle's friend, Chad Littlefield, did not shoot at the gun range.

Thinking he was acting in self-defense, he shot the two men and felt relief afterwards, Dunn said.

'He said he thought he had neutralized the threat,' Dunn said, but added that Routh told him: 'As soon as I did it, I realized I made a mistake.'

Dunn said that he does not think Routh knew what he was doing was wrong at the time because he was suffering from schizophrenia.

Routh's defense team is trying to prove the 27-year-old was in a psychotic state when he gunned down Kyle and Littlefield after they took him to the gun range in 2013.

He has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity - but the prosecution claims he acted knowingly after smoking marijuana and consuming alcohol on the morning of the killings. 

Expert: Psychiatrist Dr Mitchell H. Dunn testified on Thursday that Routh was having delusions, including that his colleagues were going to eat him and that his neighbor was in the Mexican mafia

Dunn, a forensic psychiatrist at Terrell State Hospital who interviewed Routh for more than six hours last April, explained that tests revealed the former Marine was showing signs of psychosis, including delusions, before the murders, and that he does not think it was related to substance abuse.

He described Routh's belief that he was surrounded by half-pig, half-human hybrids.

He 'believed pigs were taking over the earth,' before the killings, Dunn said. 

Among them were his colleagues at a cabinet shop, who he believed wanted to roast him with the space heater at work and then eat him, he said. 

He also believed his girlfriend, Jennifer Weed, was also becoming a pig-human hybrid, the psychiatrist added.

When he saw her eat bacon, he was shocked. 'He was thinking she was a pig hybrid. Why would you eat the flesh of your people?' Dunn explained, according to the Dallas Morning News.       

And after he arrived in jail, he believed people were going to cook him and eat him, Dunn said.

Dunn also listed Routh's multiple stints to psychiatric hospitals, starting in July 2011. 

'It was clear that he was psychotic,' Dunn told the court. 'There was no question about that.'

Fear: Laura Blevins, the sister of Eddie Ray Routh, is pictured on the stand in his murder trial on Wednesday. She recounted how he came to her home in February 2013 and admitted to killing two men

When he was hospitalized again the following year, he had bipolar disorder and a major depressive disorder with major psychotic features, and heavily used alcohol and cannabis. 

His testimony came after state district Judge Jason Cashon agreed to prosecutors' request to disqualify Dr Charles Overstreet as an expert witness for the defense after he said he does not have a physician's license.

Earlier this week, the jury heard Routh's mother, sister, brother-in-law and ex-girlfriend recall his fragile mental state after returning from service in Haiti and Iraq.

On the witness stand, his former girlfriend Jennifer Weed recalled how he once grabbed a ninja sword to protect them from people who 'were out to get them' and accused her of being a demon and trying to steal his soul. 

On another occasion, she went to see him at the request of his concerned uncle.

'He was visibly upset,' she said of Routh. 'Staring at the wall most of the time, then would break into tears and then laughter. Then he would go back to staring.' 

Weed described how she would take care of Routh, helping him take his medication and even bathing him because he would refuse to wash himself for weeks

Former life: Routh, pictured with his mother, was a Marine who served in Iraq and Haiti after the earthquake

On the night before he murdered the two men, she went to get his medication when he knelt down and proposed to her. She said yes and they hugged and cried, she said.  

But the next morning, they fought over his smoking, she said.

'F*** you, go eat a peanut and die,' he told his girlfriend, who is allergic to peanuts. She left, but called his uncle to come over because she did not want him to be alone.   

His sister and brother-in-law testified about similarly bizarre behavior on Wednesday.

Laura Blevins said her brother drove to her house in Kyle's stolen truck after killing him and Littlefield at a shooting range in 2013 but was 'not all there'. 

'The man who was my brother was not at my house,' Mrs Blevins told the court. 'When I was looking at him, he kind of looked like he was out of it, almost in a daze or something.' 

Her husband Gaines Blevins added: 'He said he took their souls before they could take his. I asked him what he meant by that, and he said they were out to get him.' 

Kyle, whose story has appeared across movie theaters in 'American Sniper', had taken Routh to the shooting range after Routh's mother contacted him, asking him to help her son, who had PTSD.  

The court has also heard how he smoked marijuana and may have consumed whiskey before heading to the shooting range with Kyle and Littlefield, but voluntary intoxication is not a defense.

A Texas Ranger testified that authorities also found anti-psychotic medication for schizophrenia while searching Routh's home after the shooting.

Last week, a former deputy testified that he overheard Routh after he'd been taken into custody say that he shot the men because they wouldn't talk to him as the three drove together to the shooting range. 

The court also heard this week how Routh became irritated when Littlefield was not shooting. 

'Are you gonna shoot? Are you gonna shoot? It's a shooting sport. You shoot,' Routh said in a phone call to a New Yorker reporter after the killings. 'That's what got me all riled up.'

In his taped confession, he also said he was fearful that if he didn't shoot the men, whom he called 'headhunters', then they would turn on him.

'If I didn't take out his soul, he was going to take my soul next,' Routh said.

The trial has drawn intense interest, partly because of an Oscar-nominated film based on Kyle's memoir.
