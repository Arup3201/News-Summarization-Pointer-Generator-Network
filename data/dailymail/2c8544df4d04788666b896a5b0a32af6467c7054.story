The 'Game of Thrones effect': More and more children in Britain are being given Olde English names by their parents - with mothers and fathers inspired by the hit television series

They may sound more like characters in a historical drama than our next generation of children.

But Millicent, Elvina and Alfred, along with other Olde English names, are making a comeback – with many parents inspired by fantasy television series Game of Thrones.

Medieval girls’ names including Kendra and Winnie, as well as boys’ names such as Peyton and Audley are now popular choices for babies, according to a survey.

Two in five parents questioned chose a name for their child which was last popular more than 350 years ago, with some names previously fashionable as long ago as the Middle Ages.

It replaces the previous trend for giving children more modern ‘fantasy’ names like Princess, Crystal or Prince, with 36 per cent describing these choices as ‘outdated’.

The survey of 3,961 parents, by the website Netmums, found the second most prominent British naming fad is customised spellings.

One in five had altered a name with their own spelling – for example replacing Chantel with Shantelle – in a bid to make their child stand out.

And one in eight said they had opted for a ‘posh-sounding’ name, such as Hugo, Arabella or Harriet.

Traditional surnames, for example Mackenzie or Harrison, also continued to be popular as first names with one in nine parents choosing them.

According to the survey, most parents settle on a name between the 20th week of pregnancy and the baby’s birth.

But some start thinking about their choice considerably earlier, with one in eight mothers saying they had decided on a name before they were even pregnant.

Netmums founder Siobhan Freegard said: ‘Baby names usually work on an 80-year cycle of popularity - but some of the Olde English baby names coming back haven’t been in fashion for almost 800 years.

‘However, they tick all the boxes for modern parents, being unusual but traditional, and cool but not too wacky. It’s a trend which may well grow.’

One in ten wait for around a week after the baby is born before finalising their decision, to ensure that the name suits.

But just under one per cent wait until the final day they can register their child’s to commit to a name – a full six weeks after the birth.

For boys:                    For girls:

1) Ned                        1) Millicent

2) Alfred                     2) Audrey

3) Cole                       3) Kim or Kym

4) Audley                   4) Kendra

5) Peyton                   5) Elvina

6) Wyatt                     6) Winnie

Despite the struggle to find a decent name, almost all parents said that their child’s name had been commented on, with 13 per cent saying family, friends or even strangers had been negative about their choice.

A further 19 per cent of parents admitted they chose to keep their favoured name secret – as a friend or relative had previously stolen a name they hoped to use.

But one of the most decisive factors in determining a name was whether or not it went well with the child’s surname, with 32 per cent of parents deciding on this basis.

One in five opted for a ‘name to help my child do well in life’, while 17 per cent chose an ‘unusual name to make my child stand out’.

A further 14 per cent picked a name which they felt suited their baby’s appearance.

Three in four parents (76per cent) also said that they believed children’s names influence how teachers respond to them.

George, Edward, Emily, William, Hannah and Elizabeth were perceived as the names teachers felt most positive about.

But Jayden, Crystal, Bailey, Chase, Tyler and Phoenix were seen as the names most likely to make teachers assume the child could misbehave.

Among the more unusual names which can currently be heard on British playgrounds include Lanesra (Arsenal spelt backwards), Galaxy Star, Egypt, Kaseza, Cash, Mysti-Rae, Woodrow, Tarrant and Odin Fox.
