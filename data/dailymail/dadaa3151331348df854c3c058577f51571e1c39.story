A 10-year-old girl from San Jose, California, who offered the contents of her piggy bank in hopes of getting her stolen puppy back was reunited with her beloved pet on Thursday.

The pooch, a five-month-old shih tzu-Yorkie mix, was returned to Marissa Mabang after being spotted in Los Banos - more than 100 miles from home.

The happy reunion was made possible by Blanca Del Real, who said that a woman handed her the puppy after she noticed Meeko wandering around a Target store parking lot on Wednesday.

Del Real offered to take the apparently stray dog home, but later that day she read a story about Meeko and realized that the pooch she picked up in the parking lot for her young son might be the missing pet, the San Francisco Chronicle reported.

She called Marissa's family, who then asked Los Baños Animal Control to check the puppy's microchip, which turned out to be a perfect match.

The pet was taken along with thousands of dollars worth of electronics when someone broke into the Magangs' home on Monday.

The desperate Marissa issued a public plea, offering her piggy bank savings in exchange for the safe return of Meeko.

Heart-warming: The overjoyed Marissa thanked everyone for helping reunite her with Meeko and promised to keep him safe

On Thursday, when she came home from school, the 10-year-old was greeted by her older sister, who was carrying little Meeko.

'Thank you to everybody who made this happen,' said Marissa. 'I can’t believe he is in my arms.

She added, 'I am so happy he’s back with my family. He's gonna be safe no matter what now.’

The police and fire unions put together a $5,000 reward for Meeko’s return and Councilman Ash Kalra added another $1,000.

Noble gesture: Del Real, right, was handed a check for $6,000 as a reward, but she declined to accept Marissa's piggy bank

Del Real accepted their reward but declined to the contents of Mabanag’s piggy bank, according to KGO.

'This is not just a dog, it’s not money, it’s my daughter’s heart,' said Mabanag’s mother, Marie. 

Police believe the burglars dumped Meeko after seeing that the dog's photo was splashed across the Internet.

Safe return: Marissa Mabanag, 10, centre, has offered the contents of her piggy bank to get back her puppy, Meeko

Stolen: Meeko, a six-month-old shih-tzu-Yorkie mix, was stolen when their house was burglarised on Monday

The Mabanag’s home has been burglarised twice this year already. Marissa's father, Michael Mabanag, told the San Jose Mercury News that while the family had taken preventative measures following the first burglary, it clearly wasn’t enough.

The father came home Monday to find their garage open and windows of the house smashed in. Several electronic items were missing, as well as the family’s bicycles.

He said the first thing he did was to look for Meeko. But the little pup was nowhere to be found. ‘It was one of the worst days of my life,’ he told the paper, after he realized Meeko was gone.

‘How do you break that to your daughter?’

Big reward: Marissa is offering her piggy bank - plus an additional $6,000 donated by the police and firefighter unions, and a donation from San Jose City Council's Ash Kalra

Namesake: Marissa said she named the puppy after Meeko, the mischievous raccoon from the Disney film Pocahontas

Talking to a group of reporters, Marissa said that she named the dog after the mischievous raccoon from the Disney movie, Pocahontas.

She added that he was a ‘dead ringer’ for Chewbacca from the Star Wars films.

According to ABC affiliate ABC7 News, Mr Mabanag brought home the puppy over the summer after his two daughters made their school’s honor roll.
