The family of a cable fitter who died after taking an accidental overdose of a drug he bought online to fight the pain caused by a work accident has been awarded a five-figure compensation deal.

Father-of-one Daniel Batchelor, 36, was forced to have his lower right leg amputated after falling off a ladder while working as an engineer and breaking his limb in two places.

He bought a drug online to help him deal with the pain, but was found unconscious in bed at his home in Weymouth, Dorset, in January last year after taking an accidental overdose of the medication.

Mr Batchelor had been working for Wifigear Ltd as a wireless installation engineer when, in 2011, his ladder collapsed underneath him, sending him plunging 12ft through the air, before hitting the concrete ground below.

He broke his right leg in two places and fractured his right wrist in the fall.

Despite multiple operations, he was unable to return to work and he went on to develop compartment syndrome in his leg - when pressure within the muscles builds to dangerous levels, causing paralysis and infection.  

Struggling to deal with the pain, Mr Batchelor decided to buy a drug online because he was allergic to opiate-based medicines that are usually prescribed. 

But he was found unconscious in his bed by his long-term partner of five years, Shari Newman, on 22 January, 2014.

He died after choking on his own vomit, which caused his brain to be starved of oxygen.

An inquest found he had died as a result of an accidental overdose, taken with the intent to relieve himself from pain. 

The hearing at Dorset Coroner's Court also heard how he had suffered short-term memory problems after the accident and, as a result, took too much of the painkiller.

Coroner Sheriff Payne said there was no evidence to suggest Mr Batchelor had taken the drugs with the intention of ending his life and said it was another episode of the father trying to get pain relief and misjudging the amount he was taking.

His former employer has now admitted he had been given a ladder to carry out his work, despite it being inappropriate and dangerous for the task he was trying to do.

And his family, including three-year-old son Alfie, has been awarded an undisclosed five-figure settlement.

Anna Pask, from the Irwin Mitchell law firm, described it as 'a heartbreaking case'.

She said: 'Daniel was working so hard to get his life back on track after his accident and he was looking forward to marrying his fiancee, Shari, in September 2014.

'His recovery and rehabilitation were very painful, but he showed remarkable courage and strength.

'We are pleased that Daniel's employers accepted liability for the accident and we have secured a settlement for Daniel's family which will provide Shari and Alfie with some financial security for the future.

'The last few years have been incredibly traumatic for the family and the conclusion of the legal case means they can now start to rebuild their lives. '

Ms Newman, 35, said: 'Our family are still desperately struggling to come to terms with what has happened to Daniel and the most heartbreaking thing is knowing Alfie will have to grow up without a father.

'Daniel knew he was lucky to be alive after the fall. He wanted to be able to provide for me and Alfie and he was desperate to be able to return to work - even after his amputation, Daniel talked about training to become a postman.

'But Daniel struggled to manage his pain and it was very hard watching him suffer.'

Ms Newman, who was engaged to marry Mr Batchelor, also called for a change in the law to prevent people from buying certain drugs over the Internet.

She added: 'Daniel felt completely helpless and he thought the only way he could cope with the pain was to purchase his own medication.

'The drugs Daniel bought should not be available over the internet and more should be done to raise awareness of the huge risks that come with taking them.

'It is heartbreaking to think what we have been put through as a family, all as a result of an accident which was completely avoidable.

'Companies have a duty to provide appropriate work equipment and if Daniel's employers had done this, he would still be here today.

'I am relieved that the legal process has come to a conclusion and I can now try and focus on mine and Alfie's future.'
