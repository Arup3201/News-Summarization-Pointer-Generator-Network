Jose Mourinho's decision to release Samuel Eto'o could prove costly  if the striker does the damage against Chelsea at Goodison Park on Saturday evening.

With that in mind, Sportsmail have decided to take a trip back down memory lane to identify the players who have made either a good or bad impression on their first appearance for their new side.

Debuts to forget

Fernando Torres (Chelsea debut)

Chelsea 0 vs 1 Liverpool (6th February 2011)

Chelsea’s record £50million signing failed to make the impact he would have wanted on his debut against former club Liverpool, as Chelsea slumped to a 1-0 defeat. 

Fernando Torres was named in a three man attack alongside Didier Drogba and Nicolas Anelka, which on paper looked deadly, but Torres couldn’t get off to the fairy tale start he desired.

Instead Torres struggled to get into the game and saw his only effort fly high and wide, before he was replaced by Salomon Kalou on 66 minutes, met by cheers from the travelling contingent who taunted their former hero.

Teddy Sheringham – Man United debut 

Tottenham 1 vs 2 Man United (10th August 1997)

It was mixed emotions for Teddy Sheringham on his Manchester United debut as despite getting off to a winning start, he missed a penalty against his former club. 

Sheringham was jeered throughout by the home fans, but he missed his chance to silence the White Hart Lane faithful when he saw his penalty cannon back off the post, leaving the score at 0-0. 

Two second half United goals saved Sheringham’s blushes, but it is a moment he will not look back on fondly, and not the way he would have liked to start his United career.

Neil Alexander – Hearts debut 

Rangers 1 vs 2 Hearts (10th August 2014)

Neil Alexander spent over five years at Rangers and despite mainly being used as a second choice goalkeeper throughout his time at Ibrox, he relished his debut against his former club. 

This joy was short lived however, as after 67 minutes the 36-year-old was left concussed after a clash of heads with his new team-mate and was rushed to hospital. Not the way he would have envisaged his Hearts debut, but nevertheless his new side grabbed a last gasp winner earning the three points.

Debuts to remember

Dean Saunders – Aston Villa home debut 

Aston Villa 4 vs 2 Liverpool (19th September 1992)

Dean Saunders became Aston Villa’s record signing in a £2.5million deal, and he made his home debut against Liverpool, the side that had broken the British transfer record to sign him the year before. 

In a game that is remembered for Ronnie Rosenthal’s famous open goal miss, Saunders also grabbed some headlines himself with two goals against his former employers. 

This was a bitter pill to swallow for Liverpool fans, as the man who had struggled to make an impression for the reds, tore them apart on his Villa debut.

Stephane Sessegnon – West Brom debut 

West Brom 3 vs 0 Sunderland (21st September 2013)

Stephane Sessegnon’s West Brom debut was delayed due to his failure to obtain a work permit any earlier, which set up a fiery debut against his former club Sunderland. 

Paolo Di Canio criticised Sessegnon’s attitude in the build up to the game, but this only served to fire up the Benin international who came back to haunt the Italian by taking the lead for his new side 20 minutes in. 

His sale was not popular amongst Sunderland fans who gave Sessegnon a large ovation when his name was read out, and the new West Brom man responded by refusing to celebrate against his former club.

Silencing the critics: Stephane Sessegnon done his talking on the pitch by giving his side the lead 

Craig Bellamy – Man City debut 

Man City 2 vs 1 Newcastle (28th January 2009)

Craig Bellamy marked his £14million move to Mark Hughes’ Man City with a winning goal on his debut against former side Newcastle. 

Bellamy spent four years on Tyneside where he netted 42 times, but he came back to haunt his former club with an impressive display and a decisive goal as he started a new chapter at his 8th new club.

Match winner: Craig Bellamy scored for Manchester City against Newcastle in the Citizens' 2-1 win

John Barnes – Charlton debut 

Charlton 1 vs 0 Liverpool (13th February 1999)

John Barnes enjoyed a successful 10 year spell at Liverpool and there were no hard feelings when he pulled on a Charlton shirt to make his debut against his former team. 

Instead this gave Barnes, who came on as a second half substitute, the chance of one more farewell to the travelling Liverpool support. It wasn’t only a testimonial game for Barnes though as his new side ran out 1-0 winners in a rare win for them in a season which saw them relegated.
