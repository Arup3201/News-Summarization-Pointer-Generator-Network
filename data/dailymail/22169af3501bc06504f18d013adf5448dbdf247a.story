Eight suspected militants were killed on the Afghan border of Pakistan today in a strike by several missiles from American drones.

Two Pakistani intelligence officials said the compound was located near the town of Mir Ali in the North Waziristan tribal area.

One of the officials said an al Qaida operative was believed to have been killed in the strike.North Waziristan, the area where the strike occurred, is considered a stronghold for insurgent groups operating in both Afghanistan and Pakistan.

It is one of the few parts of the tribal areas that border Afghanistan in which the Pakistani military has not conducted a military operation to root out militants, despite repeated pushes to do so from the American government.

Today's strike was the fourth since the new year began.

On Sunday nine Pakistani Taliban fighters were killed when American missiles fired from several drones flying overhead slammed into three militant hideouts in another tribal area, South Waziristan.

The militant in charge of training 
suicide bombers for the Pakistani Taliban was believed by Pakistan 
intelligence officials to have died in Sunday's strike.

On January 2, a drone strike killed a top Pakistani militant commander, Maulvi Nazir.

He was accused of carrying out deadly attacks against American and other targets across the border in Afghanistan.

But unlike most members of the Taliban in Pakistan, he negotiated a truce with the Pakistani military in 2009 and did not attack Pakistani troops or domestic targets.

The US's covert drone programme is extremely controversial in Pakistan where many in the country look at it as an infringement on their sovereignty.

Many Pakistanis complain that innocent civilians have also been killed, something the US rejects.
