A Russian oligarch who lost a multi-billion pound legal battle with Chelsea Football Club owner Roman Abramovich last year is a 'man under financial pressure' according to a top judge as details of a fresh High Court fight with his former partner emerged.

Boris Berezovsky had wanted 'total privacy' imposed upon early proceedings of his multi-million pound High Court case involving Elena Gorbunova.

But complaints from journalists prompted Mr Justice Mann to yesterday release a written ruling he made during behind-closed-doors proceedings last week.

The ruling read that Ms Gorbunova - the mother of the couple's two children who sat alongside Mr Berezovsky during much of his legal wrangling with Roman Abramovich - was complaining that she had not received millions she had been promised by her former partner.

A freezing order of up to £200million of Mr Berezokovsky's assets was already made last month with Justice Mann asked to discharge that order.

But the judge ruled that a freezing order should remain and include proceeds from the sale of property in England and France. He did not disclose a total figure.

Mr Berezovsky is expected to 'vigorously contest' his former partner's legal claim.

He had originally wanted the proceedings to be removed from court listings which are freely available to the public.

But written representations by journalists argued that there was a danger that people would think that the rich and powerful are allowed privileges if the case was held in private.

Mr Justice Mann said in his ruling: 'On the evidence, Mr Berezovsky is a man under financial pressure.

'It is likely he will feel a more pressing need to satisfy creditors than satisfy Ms Gorbunova.'

In August 2012, Mr Berezovsky was criticised by the judge who ruled on his battle with Mr Abramovich.

Mrs Justice Gloster dismissed a series of claims by Mr Berezovsky - who wanted more than £3billion damages from Abramovich - and the loss left Mr Berezovsky facing legal bills totalling tens of millions of pounds.

The judge said Mr Berezovsky had been an 'unimpressive, and inherently unreliable, witness' and had, at times, given evidence which was 'deliberately dishonest' and 'incredible'.

He had sued and accused Mr Abramovich of blackmail, breach of trust and breach of contract.

He said the billionaire Russian businessman had 'intimidated' him into selling shares in a Russian oil company at a fraction of their value and broken a promise made during a deal relating to a Russian aluminium company.

Ms Gorbunova, 45, had testified in Mr Berezovsky's favour in that case, but her evidence was dismissed by the judge.
