An enraged golfer has been caught on camera breaking all of his golf clubs in a post-game tantrum.

The unnamed man was filmed following a round at Spring Mill, Pennsylvania by fellow golfer Bryce Bundy, who then shared the video to Facebook and YouTube.

In the footage, the man works through his clubs one-by-one, snapping them across his leg, throwing them to the ground and even using his head to bend their shafts.

And once he's done with the clubs, he moves on to his bags, which he throws to the ground and kicks - all while using a fair few foul words.

Destructive: A golfer breaks his clubs in a fit of rage at a Pennsylvania golf course after a bad round

During his rant, other players can be heard laughing, which only serves to encourage him.

'That's about the end of that,' he yells after destroying one club, before spying another one and adding: 'Hold on, I kind of like this one.'

He spares a few other items.

'I just got this towel,' he can be heard saying. 'I'm keeping this motherf*****.'

Think he'll be invited back? Finally, he takes his anger out on his golf bag, throwing it to the ground

At one point, a course marshal approaches him 'probably asking the guy to act like a rational human being,' said GolfNewsNet, which first shared the video.

Bundy, a basketball coach from New Jersey, shared the video to his Facebook page, quipping: 'The funniest golf video ever.'

But not all viewers shared the same opinion.

'These guys are an embarrassment to the sport of golf,' one YouTube viewer wrote. 'This is supposed to be a gentleman's game, not a game of thuggery.'
