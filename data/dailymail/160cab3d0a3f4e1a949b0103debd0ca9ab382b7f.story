Arsenal midfielder Santi Cazorla has been named the PFA Fans’ Player of the Month for December after some magnificent performances for the Gunners.

The Spaniard has been instrumental for Arsenal keeping pace with their rivals for the Champions League places, scoring four goals and contributing one assist in December.

Cazorla’s fine form saw off competition from David de Gea, Harry Kane, Cesc Fabregas and Charlie Austin for the award.
