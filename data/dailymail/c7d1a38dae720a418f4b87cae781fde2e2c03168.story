This tree was always destined for greatness and now it is finally going to be seen by almost everyone in the country at some point over the festive season.

This year's Christmas tree arrived on the West Front Lawn of the Capitol Building on Friday afternoon.

The 2014 model is an 88-foot-tall white spruce which comes from a national forest in Minnesota.

It was harvested on October 29 in the Chippewa National Forest and has spent several weeks on the road visiting communities and military bases before reaching its final, picturesque home in Washington D.C.

The holiday tradition of the Capitol Christmas Tree, or 'The People's Tree', began in 1964.

Rigged: Steve Graham signals to a ground crew atop the Capitol Christmas tree on the west side of the Capitol

Graham was rigging the white spruce that came from the Chippewa National Forest in Cass Lake, Minnesota for its place on the West Lawn of the Capitol.

House Speaker John W. McCormack put a 
live Christmas tree on the Capitol lawn. 

That particular tree, a 24-foot
 Douglas Fir from Pennsylvania, lived three years before succumbing to 
wind and root damage.

All selection, installation, and decoration of the tree are all overseen by the Superintendent of the Capitol Grounds of the Architect of the Capitol.

In 1970, the Capitol Architect asked the U.S. Forest Service to provide the Capitol Christmas landmark. So for the last 44 years a different National Forest has been chosen to provide The People's Tree.  

Finally in place: The tree will be decorated with approximately 10,000 handmade ornaments from Minnesota communities as a gift from the 'Land of 10,000 Lakes'
