A eye-catching building from a world-famous architect will soon become the home of the faculty of business for the University of Technology Sydney.

Revered Canadian architect Frank Gehry, labelled by Vanity Fair as 'the most important architect of our age', is behind the design, which is his debut in Australia.

The building, with its crumpled paper bag exterior, joins an architecture revolution in the areas surrounding and included in the institution.

It's labelled the Dr Chau Chak Wing Building, after a prominent Chinese-Australian businessman who donated $20 million to the project, reports ABC.

It's a far cry from the brutalist Tower building, which Frank Gehry himself dubbed 'Sydney's Ugliest Building' in 2009.

And the warped, Gaudi-esque aesthetic functions for more than just appearances-it encapsulates the educational direction the university is taking.

Professor Shirley Alexander, the University deputy Vice Chancellor, says the innovative structure would encourage creative thinking and innovation among students.

 'There are no more lecture theatres in our buildings because we think they can be done just as well online,' she said.

The  shift in teaching sees a change towards intimate, hands on learning environments, with online lectures largely replacing conventional classes.

The design represents a broader construction revolution at the nationally acclaimed institution.

In July, the University opened the home to the Faculty of Engineering and Information Technology, a state-of-the-art energy sustaining building adorned with eye catching LED green lights.

Across the street, the 33-storey Central Park apartment complex has attention worldwide accolades, with lush greenery adorning the walls and a hovering cantilever which turns to a shimmering firework of movement at night time.

These buildings are rapidly changing the face of what was an outmoded architectural district of Sydney.
