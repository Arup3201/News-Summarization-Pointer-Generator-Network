Bobbi Kristina Brown's distraught father Bobby Brown headed to her bedside today as she continues to battle for her life.

The concerned father was seen walking towards Emory University Hospital in Atlanta with his wife Alicia Etheredge and his daughter LaPrincia Brown, 24, on Wednesday morning.

Hiding beneath hats, the trio stayed largely silent as they walked towards the facility, where Bobbi Kristina was moved on Monday.

It comes days after the 21-year-old aspiring singer was found face-down in a bathtub in her Roswell, Georgia home by her purported husband, Nick Gordon - nearly three years after her mother, Whitney Houston, died after being found in eerily similar circumstances.

On Wednesday, it emerged that police are looking into the possibility that eye-witnesses may have fled the scene after Bobbi Kristina was found on Saturday morning.

Police said Gordon attempted to revive her while a friend called 911, and that she was alive when rushed to a hospital.

Now Roswell Police Detectives are investigating whether people fled before officers arrived and have been asking local businesses if they saw anything suspicious that morning, E! News reported.

Nearby bank employees told detectives they saw nothing but police have requested surveillance footage, sources told the website.

She remains in a medically-induced coma and is breathing with the help of a ventilator.

During tests for brain activity, she briefly opened her eyes and doctors have found 'minimal' improvement in her brain function, TMZ reported earlier this week.

Questions still remain over what part drugs - if any - played in Saturday's incident; police reportedly found narcotics in the home during a second search last weekend.

Bobby Brown has had his own share of drug troubles, including how he admitted to using 'an awful lot' of cocaine after marrying Whitney Houston in 1992.

'I think I was bored,' he previously told VH1's Behind the Music. 'I had just gotten married and things weren't right. Unfortunately, I turned to alcohol and drugs.' 

He was also previously arrested for drug possession, including in 2002 when he was found carrying marijuana while speeding - just months after he was taken to hospital by his concerned wife and friends.

In 2000, he also spent 26 days in a Florida jail for violating probation on a 1996 drunken-driving charge by not submitting to a drug test. 

Other, more recent troubles have included a 2012 arrest for DUI and a stint in rehab in August of that year for alcohol addiction - before being arrested for another DUI just three months later.

In 2013, he served just nine hours behind bars after pleading no contest to suspicion of driving under the influence of alcohol.

He has remained tight-lipped about Bobbi Kristina's condition, only saying on Monday that the young woman was continuing to fight for her life.

But on Tuesday, Bobby Brown spoke out again through his lawyer to correct reports that his daughter had married Gordon, who found her in the bathtub on Saturday.   

Following Houston's death three years ago, Bobbi entered into a relationship with Gordon - a sort-of step-brother after her mother welcomed him into their home when he was 12.

Then last January the couple announced that they had got married, and Bobbi Kristina posted photos of their 'wedding rings' on social media.

But on Tuesday a lawyer representing Bobbi's father released the following statement: 'We are currently investigating the events that led to the hospitalization of Bobbi Kristina.'

'To correct earlier reports, Bobbi Kristina is not and has never been married to Nick Gordon,' added Christopher Brown of Brown & Rosen LLC.

Relations between Gordon and  other family members have been rocky and he remains subject to a protective order barring him from being within 200 feet of Bobbi Kristina's aunt, Patricia Houston.

Bobby has five children; LaPrincia, 24, is his daughter with Kim Ward, from who he split in 1991. Bobbi Kristina is his only child with Whitney Houston, whom he divorced in 2007.
