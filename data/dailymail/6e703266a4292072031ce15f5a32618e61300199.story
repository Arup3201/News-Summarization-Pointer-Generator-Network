Amy Pascal got applause from Sony Pictures employees at a town hall meeting

Embattled Sony Pictures boss Amy Pascal has gotten applause from employees at a town hall meeting where she apologized for the damage caused by her hacked emails being released to the public. 

Pascal, the co-chairman of Sony Pictures, is fighting to save her job after her emails revealed racially insensitive comments and snipes at some of Hollywood's biggest stars.

She was joined by CEO Michael Lynton at a brief meeting with employees on the studio's movie lot in Culver City in Los Angeles.

'It devastates me that something I did or said in a second would hurt any one of you and for that I am profoundly sorry,' she said at the meeting, according to audio obtained by Good Morning America.

Employees responded by applauding Pascal, according to The Hollywood Reporter.

Pascal remains defiant and is refusing to step down - despite rising calls for her to be fired over the contents of her hacked emails. 

Her message of regret to employees - who lined up out the door to hear her speak - is part of a wider apology tour. 

Pascal is reaching out to movie bigwigs, including Harvey Weinstein, to apologize in advance for more leaks of her emails, according to Variety. 

Sony appears to be rallying behind her, as well, and is attempting to get executives at other film studios to signs a letter of support for her and for Sony.

Variety reports that many movie honchos are reluctant to be drawn into the hacking scandal - or be seen showing solidarity with Sony, lest they be targeted by hackers, too.  

Show of support: Sony Pictures CEO Michael Lynton appeared at a town hall meeting with Pascal on Monday to reassure employees

Lynton called the meeting on Monday to rally employees at the film studio after it was attacked by hackers who released millions of documents. 

'Our business has a strong economic foundation. This won’t take us down,' he told employees, The Hollywood Reporter says. 

The email leaks have garnered the biggest headlines. Pascal was forced to apologize after making racially tinged remarks about President Barack Obama. 

Emails also reveal a producer friend calling Angelina Jolie a 'minimally talented spoiled brat,' Pascal herself called Leonardo DiCaprio 'despicable,' a fellow executive called Kevin Hart a greedy 'whore,' and she also allegedly made a joke about TV deals being the new 'black baby' - the accessory top Hollywood stars have to have.

Today, a source close to the studio told MailOnline: 'This is ridiculous. Amy was making an Orange is The New Black reference and like anybody else could have, left out the comma in the middle of writing a quick email filled with shorthand and abbreviations.'

However, the personal information - including social security numbers, addresses, salaries and other details - was released for some 47,000 past and current Sony employees - a devastating security breach. 

Sony's stock has also fallen 10percent since the leak, which came just after Thanksgiving. Hackers - possibly either from North Korea or sympathetic to the hermit regime there -  have promised a 'Christmas gift' that will 'put Sony Pictures into the worst state.'
