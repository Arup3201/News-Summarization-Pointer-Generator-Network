Accused: Alicia Gould, 28,  has been charged with attempted murder

A 28-year-old woman has been charged with attempted murder after police say she threw a plugged-in radio alarm clock into a motel bathtub while her boyfriend was in it.

Police in the Rochester suburb of Webster tell local media that Alicia Gould and her boyfriend were in a room at motel early Friday when they got into an argument. 

It is alleged that while the man was taking a bath, Gould threw the radio alarm clock into the water in an attempt to electrocute him.

Police say the room's ground fault interrupter went off, stopping any electrical current from making its way through the water.  

Police arrived at the Super 8 Motel at 4:32 a.m. on November 28.

Webster Police Chief Gerald Pickering said: 'Officers arrived at the scene and through their investigation, found a male and a female that were in a domestic disturbance.

'It appeared that the female had attempted to murder her male counterpart.

He said under New York State Law Gould was arrested immediately. 

'It sounded like there was some admissions, some confessions made to the investigators and the 911 dispatchers prior to the response,' Pickering said.

'I'm sure that there are circumstances that may come out regarding the allegation, and perhaps in defense of the victim.'

Gould is facing a second degree attempted murder charge and is being held in the Monroe County Jail on $20,000 cash bail. 

It was not immediately clear if she has a lawyer.
