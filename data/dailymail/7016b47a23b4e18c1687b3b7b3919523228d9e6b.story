Two gunmen have been jailed for life for shooting dead an aspiring rapper in a case of mistaken identity as he sat in his car outside his family home.

Umar Tufail, 25, was the victim of a South London gang's 'deliberate execution' after his younger brother Amir stabbed one of the two gunmen three months before, the prosecution told the Old Bailey today.

Kyrone Daley and Sanchez Thomas, both 19 and from West Norwood were found guilty of murder.

Revenge: Gunmen Kyrone Daley, left, and Sanchez Thomas, both 19, were told by the judge 'the motive for this shocking murder lies in the gang culture in South London'

Victim: Umar Tufail was likely to have been mistaken for his brother who had stabbed Sanchez Thomas last year

Thomas will serve a minimum term of 25 years and Daley 22 years.

In July last year, Thomas drove with Daley, both members of Bromley-based 
gang Squeeze Section, to South Norwood where the
 Tufail brothers lived, bent on getting their revenge.

As Umar Tufail, who rapped under the name 
Humuh and was also known as Rems, sat in his car the pair pulled up and a single shot was fired at 
his head through the window at almost point-blank range with a .32 calibre handgun.

The 
pair, then both 18, sped off in Thomas’ mother’s Vauxhall 
Corsa, while Tufail’s mother and brother raced out of their home to help Umar.

Despite being rushed to King's College Hospital Tufail died the next day.

Judge Stephen Kramer told them: 'It seems that the motive for this shocking murder lies in the gang culture in south London in which guns are readily available.

'For a perceived slight for you, Sanchez Thomas, having been stabbed in the leg by the younger brother of the deceased, I am satisfied your motive was revenge.

'Both brothers looked similar. Whether by accident or design, you took your revenge on the brother who had not stabbed you.'

During the trial both Thomas and Daley attempted to blame each other for the murder.

Daley in his defence said Thomas stopped the car alongside the red Vauxhall Corsa that Umar was sitting in, opened the front passenger window and 'repeatedly accused the victim of being Rems' which he denied.

Grieving parents: Umar's mother Francesca Thompson, left, ran out to take her son to hospital but Umar died the following day. His father Saj Tufail, right, holds a picture of his late son.

Daley then alleged that Thomas reached down below the driver’s seat and pulled out the gun and 'when Thomas established that the victim was the brother of Rems he, without any notice, shot him.'

However, Thomas claimed a third person in the car, who asked for a lift earlier in the journey, was the gunman.

Thomas told the court the identity of the alleged killer for the first time during the trial blaming a member of Croydon’s Don’t Say Nothing (DSN) gang called Pauser.

It delayed the start of the trial but detectives found the third man had been in Maidstone on the weekend of the killing.

After returning to West Norwood, Daley and Thomas took a minicab to a friend’s house in Fulham.

Police examined the car and later found gunshot residue on Thomas’ top.

Thomas and Daley waved to family members as they were led from the dock, while some in the public gallery applauded the killers and shouted ‘well done’.
