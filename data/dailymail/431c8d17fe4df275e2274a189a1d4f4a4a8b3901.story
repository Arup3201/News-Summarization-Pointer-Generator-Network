A thief stole a diamond engagement ring from a woman's hand while pretending to comfort her as she suffered an epileptic fit.

Charlotte Hardy-Pickering, 23, had a seizure as she walked through a park near her home in Bootle, Merseyside, earlier this week.

As she came round, she found herself lying on the ground with a man she did not know next to her, fiddling with her hand.

Charlotte Hardy-Pickering, 23, had her aquamarine and diamond ring stolen from her during an epileptic fit

It was only later that she realised the nine carat gold diamond and aquamarine engagement ring had gone from her finger.

Today Miss Hardy-Pickering, who is to marry her fiancé Ian Callister next month, pleaded for the ring, worth several hundred pounds, to be returned to her. 

She said: 'I feel really violated and upset. During and after a seizure I'm at my most vulnerable and someone has taken advantage of that.' 

Mr Callister, a drain maintenance worker, gave her the ring when he proposed to her last June.

She said: 'I was cutting through North Park to get to Bootle train station to meet my mum and go swimming in Formby. 

'All I can remember is waking up on the grass by the playground.

'After a seizure I'm confused and out of sorts, and it's very scary. I saw a woman to my right holding my bags: she smiled at me and was really reassuring and asked me if I needed an ambulance.

'But there was a guy to my left who made me feel uncomfortable. He smelt of booze and he was playing with my hand. I could feel my ring going up and down my finger.

'He said I shouldn't worry and he was just making sure my hand was clean. I wanted to tell him to get off but I couldn't because my voice wasn't back yet.

North Park, Bootle: Miss Hardy-Pickering was walking through this park when she suffered a seizure

'I just looked back at the woman and her reassuring eyes, then I looked back at the man and he had gone.

'I only realised my engagement ring was missing when I was on the train afterwards.'

She said she didn't believe the woman who helped her was with the man, and wanted to thank her for coming to her aid and ask her for help in tracking the man down. 

Miss Hardy-Pickering is unable to work due to her epilepsy and had to give up her dream of becoming a teacher because of the condition, which was diagnosed when she was 11.

She said: 'I have three different kinds of seizures. I have two daily and one type, the bigger 'tonic-clonic' seizure, sometimes known as grand mal, which this one was.

'It's a degenerative form, so it's only going to get worse.'

A Merseyside Police spokesman said: 'This is a despicable crime which has left the victim very upset.

'I would urge anyone with information that could help our enquiry into the incident on Tuesday to get in touch.'
