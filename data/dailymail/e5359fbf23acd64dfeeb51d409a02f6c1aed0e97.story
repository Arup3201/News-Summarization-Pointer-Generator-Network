The controversial new high-speed rail line will cost every household £3,000 and ‘defies economic logic’, an independent report has warned.

Senior Tories were braced for a revolt against HS2 after a study found its price tag had soared to £80billion, double the official estimate. 

The report, released today, increased the pressure on David Cameron to abandon the scheme.

Several cabinet ministers, including Environment Secretary Owen Paterson, are known to have doubts, and some senior Labour figures have publicly turned their backs on the project.

Last night former Welsh Secretary Cheryl Gillan, who has been campaigning against HS2 since leaving the Cabinet last year, warned party leaders that opposition was growing among backbench MPs and Tory grassroots.

Ministers hope the 250mph rail link will be running between London and Birmingham from 2026, with two further lines to Leeds and Manchester planned for 2032.

But conservationists said the environmental impact will be far worse than initially feared, with a 40-mile wide construction corridor blighting 500,000 lives.

And a report published today by the Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA) found the project’s costs have been vastly underestimated. It set the real price tag at £80billion, concluding it offers ‘incredibly poor value for money’.

The planned route for HS2 cuts through Mrs Gillan’s constituency of Chesham and Amersham, Buckinghamshire.

Last night she said the Government’s determination to continue with the scheme could lose the Conservatives thousands of votes – particularly if Labour decided to oppose the project.

‘I’ve always said this is a very unpopular policy in my constituency and among a large and increasing number of Conservatives,’ she said.

‘I don’t think this is quite an election loser across the country yet, but if I were in Cabinet I’d be asking a lot of questions, because the more we look at this, the more unfeasible it is.’

A minister close to Mr Cameron told the Daily Mail: ‘We’re right to press on with this but if the political pain starts to outweigh the economic gain I suspect we’ll find a way of delaying things.’ 

Last night a source close to Mr Paterson said: ‘As Environment Secretary, Owen has reassured concerned MPs who have approached him that the full rigour of environmental regulation will apply to this project as to any other.’ 

The IEA report comes a month after Britain’s business leaders called on the Government to review HS2 because of its spiralling cost.

The think-tank is now calling on ministers to cancel the scheme, suggesting taxpayers’ money is being used simply to ‘buy votes’. If the projected £80million was used for alternative road and rail schemes, it would benefit the economy by £300billion, it found.

Dr Richard Wellings, the report’s author, said: ‘The real tragedy is that if they want to spend our money well, they could get a massive return from other projects, whereas with HS2 the scheme itself will be loss-making. It is slightly better than digging a hole on the ground and filling it in again, but compared to alternative schemes it is very poor value for money.’ 

The original budget for HS2 was £33billion. It rose by £10billion this summer, but the IEA said this would inevitably spiral further due to route changes and extra tunnelling needed to placate opposition, as well as new stations and transport infrastructure.

The Campaign for the Protection of Rural England (CPRE) is also warning that life in towns and villages up to 25 miles each side of the route will be disrupted for years. 

And some areas will be blighted by noise of up to 95 decibels – the same as a Tube train.

A spokesman for HS2 Ltd said: ‘The IEA’s approach has clearly been designed to suit its aims and those of its funders to dismiss any major government project, something it has consistently done.’
