Arrested: Ryan Tannenholz has been accused of having sex with a cat

A man who enjoys dressing up as a dog has been arrested for having sex with a cat in Idaho.

Ryan Havens Tannenholz, 28, is accused of sexually abusing the pet several times over the course of a year.

Police arrested the man from Boise, Idaho, on August 1st, on six felony counts of crimes against nature and one misdemeanor count of cruelty to an animal.

Tannenholz is said to be a 'furry' - the name given to a member of a community of people who dress as animals.

According to Flayrah, a site dedicated to furries, he had a number of animal alter-egos including a dog, a wolf, a white husky and a fox.

Photos on a social media site posted by Tannenholz appear to show him in character as a creature called Bubblegum.

He is currently being held in custody in lieu of a $250,000 bond and faces up to five years in prison if convicted.

An arrest warrant was issued on July 31, and he was arrested on August 1. Police did not specify how the alleged activities came to light.

On Tannenholz's Bubblegum Husky website, he describes his interest in cats and reveals his own pet cat named Einstein.

He writes: 'Have you ever been on the internet and seen one of those cat videos? Bubblegum Husky sure has and man, I'll tell you what, they really get me going!

'Cats are so furry, soft plush and loving. Plus, only Bubblegum Husky can REALLY appreciate how truly great these furry felines truly are.'
