Five Chelsea fans who were allegedly involved when a black man was shoved off the Paris metro amid racist chanting are fighting proposed bans which will stop them travelling to football matches.

Souleymane Sylla, 33, was trying to board the busy train at Richelieu-Drouot station, ahead of the club's match against Paris St Germain, when supporters twice forced him back onto the platform.

In shocking footage filmed at the scene, fans of the Premier League club can then be heard chanting 'We're racist, we're racist and that's the way we like it', while clapping along.

Richard Barklie, a former policeman from Carrickfergus, Northern Ireland, could also be banned from games, if the Metropolitan Police win a court case to stop the men travelling to games both at home and abroad

The French commuter said the incident had 'destroyed' him, leaving him unable to work or travel on public transport. His children had also been left traumatised by the reports, he said. 

The Metropolitan Police are now applying for football banning orders to be imposed on five men whom they believe were involved in the incident.

Football banning orders can last between three and five years and are designed to stop trouble making fans travelling to matches at home and abroad. 

The men involved in the court case are former policeman Richard Barklie, 50, from Carrickfergus, Northern Ireland; City worker Joshua Parsons, 20, from Dorking; Dean Callis, 32, from Islington, north London; Jordan Munday, 20 from Sidcup and William Simpson, 26, from Ashford, Surrey. 

The group attended Waltham Forest Magistrates' Court in north-east London today for a preliminary hearing.

The men, who all wore smart suits, spoke only to confirm their identities. But prosecutor Ian Rees Phillips told the court that all five opposed the implementation of the banning orders.

Jordan Munday, 20, from Sidcup (left) and Joshua Parsons, 20, from Dorking (right) also appeared in court today. All five men are planning to fight the proposed bans 

He said: 'I understand all five respondents wish to contest matters.' 

District Judge Mary Connolly said the orders would involve severe restrictions to civil liberties. 

The incident broke out on 17 February this year while supporters were travelling to the Champions League  1-1 draw. Footage of the 'ugly scene' was recorded by British expat Paul Nolan, sparking outrage across both France and Britain. 

Barklie, who works as a director of the World Human Rights Forum, was a member of the Royal Ulster Constabulary and an officer with the Police Service of Northern Ireland.

He has previously apologised for his involvement on the night of the incident and has insisted he is not a racist person.

A spokesman for the law firm representing him said: 'He did not participate in racist chanting and singing and condemns any behaviour supporting that.

'He accepts he was involved in an incident when a person now known to him as Souleymane S was unable to enter a part of the train.

'He has an account to give to police which will explain the context and circumstances as they prevailed at that particular time.' 

Parsons, who attended £30,000 a year Millfield private school, has been suspended from his job at the Business and Commercial Finance Club in Mayfair.  

A picture emerged of Parsons posing with Ukip leader Nigel Farage, complete with the caption 'UKIP BOYS! What a geezer' but the party denied that he is a member.

Callis is expected to argue that he was not on the train carriage where the incident occurred.

Meanwhile, a statement issued by lawyers acting on behalf of Munday outside court said he 'adamantly denied' being involved in the incident. 

He said: 'We question why the Metropolitan Police Service has chosen to become involved in an incident which occurred in another European country, and only after the football fans have returned to the UK, particularly in view of the fact we are aware that football officers from the Metropolitan Police Service were on the Metro train in question.

'Mr Munday now faces a football banning order application which he intends to contest. The effects of a civil football banning order are very draconian.' 

Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho previously said the club was 'appalled' by the incident and owner Roman Abramovich is reported to be 'disgusted'. 

Club captain John Terry has previously faced scrutiny for racially abusing former QPR player Anton Ferdinand.

He was banned for four matches and fined £220,000 by the Football Association in September 2012.

Terry was acquitted of using racist language following a criminal trial on 13 July of the same year.  

All the men are expected to give evidence at the upcoming hearing scheduled for the 15 and 16 July.  

An investigation revealed earlier this week that Chelsea supporters have been involved in the highest number of reported racist incidents as they travelled to and from matches on trains.

The British Transport Police told the Press Association that since 2012 it had dealt with 15 incidents of alleged racism involving Chelsea fans, the most of any club in the country.
