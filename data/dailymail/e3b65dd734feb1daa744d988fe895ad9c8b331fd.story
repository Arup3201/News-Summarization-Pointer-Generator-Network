A new five-day break in Scotland is being launched which invites participants on 'an inner journey of discovery and remembering' with the goal of learning how to cope with loss.

The retreat is aimed at those who have lost a loved one, or who are grieving for some other reason, such as relationship breakdown, 'empty nest' syndrome or simply a lost opportunity.

Led by qualified counsellors, the holiday will be based in Ardoch House, in Scotland’s picturesque Loch Lomond National Park. 

The retreat is aimed at those who are newly separated or divorced and even empty nesters

Up to 20 people at a time can book on the retreat, and the cost of the five day break is £2,750 per person, not including travel.

The plan is to hold the retreat four times a year at Ardoch House, offering a combination of 'cutting edge therapeutic interventions and ancient African ritual practices' for people grieving about a loss in their lives.

The 133 acre Ardoch House estate has 17 bedrooms, a large dining room, numerous meeting rooms and a number of 'break-out spaces' for time out.

The five day retreat will run in three stages, past, present and future, explains course leader Donna Lancaster, who is a registered member of the Health and Care Professions Council.

Lancaster has a degree in social work and has been coaching and counselling people for more than ten years.

The  retreat will  implement meditation, visualisation, dance, breath and body work and other practices.

Co-facilitator and qualified counsellor Gabi Krueger says losses can include bereavement, separation and divorce, but also a 'loss of innocence, betrayal of trust...lost opportunities.'

'The focus is on supporting people to grieve and let go of their losses and in so doing so allowing them to return to their natural state of well-being,' she says. 

Kruger has trained in various therapies, including Non Violent Communication (NVC), the Hoffman Process, Trauma Training and Neuro Linguistic Programming (NLP).

The pair believe the course will be useful for people who recognise they have unprocessed emotions holding them back, or 'who feel blocked or hijacked by their life experiences and conditioning'.

The pilot retreat is booked to run between April 7-12 with a second planned for June. 

Ardoch House is around 20 miles from Glasgow airport and has views over nearby Loch Lomond. 

Ardoch sits on the edge of Gartocharn, a village in Loch Lomond and The Trossachs National Park. The property stands alone on high ground in the middle of the 133 acre private estate. Hill walking, water sports and numerous golf courses are all close by.
