Concerns: Europol director Rob Wainwright has warned of travelling crooks who exploit cheap flights and visa-free travel to commit crime abroad

Travelling criminals are exploiting cheap flights and visa-free travel to launch 'burglary blitzes' in foreign countries including the UK, says Europe's top policeman.

Organised criminals are flying in crooks from eastern Europe for short-term crime sprees, then shipping them out before they can be tracked by police, said the chief of Europol.

The growth of such gangs is now raising questions about the ability of British police to cope with international organised crime. 

One in seven people arrested last year in England and Wales was a foreign national.

Rob Wainwright, the director of Europol, the European crime agency, told i: 'In the past, 95 per cent of housebreakers were committed within half-a-mile.

'Now you're having Lithuanian, Polish, Romanian and Bulgarian gangs and others from across Europe jumping on airlines, knocking off [homes and businesses], and almost getting out of the country the next day.

'We have some criminal groups we've identified in Europe that are operating literally in every European country over a one- or two-year programme.'

Last year it was revealed that police from Eastern Europe were being drafted in by their British counterparts in a crackdown on the growing number of foreign criminals.

For the first time officers from Poland, Lithuania and Romania were working alongside British colleagues and targeting known convicts from their home countries.

But since then the tactics used by international gangs have only got more sophisticated. The i cited senior police who said foreign crooks were increasingly working with domestic criminals to plan crimes and launder the profits.

And those criminals who are caught before they are able to flee the country are increasingly being allowed to stay, according to a report earlier this month that found hundreds are escaping deportation.

John Vine, the independent Chief Inspector of Borders and Immigration, gave the report to the Home Secretary in the summer but it was only published at the beginning of this month.

The report looked at a major new scheme known as Operation Nexus, which involves immigration officials working in police stations to run checks on suspects’ immigration status and criminal history.

It concluded that despite significant improvements in some areas, many foreign offenders were still being released by police without checking they were allowed to be in the country.

The scheme has had a ‘positive impact’ after it was introduced in London in October 2012, the report said.

The number of immigration offenders deported from the capital has risen by 158 per cent from 418 in 2011-12 to 1,077 in 2013-14.

But 336 of 717 foreign nationals detained by West Midlands Police – the other force in the scheme’s trial – were released before their immigration status was checked.

The force also only saw a small rise in the number of foreign criminals that were removed – from 239 in 2012-13 to 274 last year.

And some suspects held by the Metropolitan Police were freed because staff shortages meant there were no immigration officers available to run the checks.
