There's a strict set of standards for organic foods. But the rules are looser for household cleaners, textiles, cosmetics and the organic dry cleaners down the street.

It's a little known fact that the USDA doesn't regulate the use of the term 'organic' for any of such products, unless they're made entirely from food or agriculture products overseen by its National Organic Program.

Companies, therefore, can brand their non-food products as ‘organic’ with little USDA oversight as long as they don't use the USDA organic seal or certification. 

Confusing: It's a little known fact that the USDA doesn't  regulate the use of the term 'organic' for many non-food products including cleaners, personal care products and textiles

When it comes to personal care products, clothing, bed linen or even some gardening products, a shopper's only way to be sure they are really buying organic, is do his or her own research.

'The consumer should not need a law degree to read a label,' says Laura Batcha, president of the Organic Trade Association, the industry's main trade group.

Concerned about the image of organics, the association is pressuring the government to better investigate organic claims on non-food items.

According to its figures, sales of these non-food organic items were about $2.8 billion last year, a small share of the overall organic market but growing rapidly; and unlike food, with very little regulation.

Miles McEvoy, head of the USDA's National Organic Program maintains there are indeed clear standards for items within the scope of its regulation, but says: 'The areas that are outside of our scope could cause some confusion.'

The Federal Trade Commission normally investigates deceptive claims. But the agency demurred in its 'Green Guides' published in 2012, saying enforcement of organic claims on non-food products could duplicate USDA duties.

A claim is only deceptive if it misleads consumers, the agency says. So, it will study consumer perceptions of the word organic. But officials weren't able to say when such a study might begin.

Ms Batcha of the Organic Trade Association says the lack of enforcement could erode confidence in the organic industry as a whole.

The industry has similarly been fighting overuse of the word 'natural,' which has no legal meaning at all.

'Companies are chasing the consumers and the government is in the rear-view mirror,' says Ken Cook, head of the Environmental Working Group, an advocacy group that publishes online consumer databases on cosmetics and cleaning.

So what's a consumer to do, especially when organic products are often more expensive and the market is continuing to grow?

Right now, retailers are the first line of defense.

Four years ago, Whole Foods Market announced strict standards for labeling in the store's well-stocked cosmetics, home cleaning and clothing aisles.

The retailer also requires all products to list ingredients.

Joe Dickson, global quality standards coordinator for the Austin, Texas-based chain, says: 'In areas where there isn't a government regulation, we have stepped up to create our own.'

David Bronner, the president of Dr. Bronner's Magic Soaps, has fought for years to get the USDA to expand its powers on organics to include personal care products.

He says Whole Foods' standards have helped clean up the market, but there are still less scrupulous companies that stretch the meaning of the word organic.

Often this includes petroleum-based oils and non-organic palm and coconut oils - which are not generally perceived as organic by the general public - and make up the base of many personal care products.

Some grocery stores, spas and online retailers have no standards at all; and some dry cleaners promote 'organic' on their windows and in their stores, despite there being no legal definition for the practice.

Mary Scalco, CEO of the industry group Drycleaning and Laundry Institute, said some of those businesses may actually be using petroleum-based solutions.

'The difficult part is the scientific meaning of organic and the consumer perception of the word,' she says.

'Because there is no real regulation on this right now, you want to make sure you don't mislead the public.'

Aside from Whole Foods, there do exist private certification agencies; including the NSF/ANSI 305 and the Global Organic Textile Standard, but most consumers don't know to look for that label.

Mr Bronner's advice to shoppers is to read labels carefully and scan lists of ingredients.

If you find several unpronounceable ingredients that sound like chemicals, 'it's probably not organic,' he says.
