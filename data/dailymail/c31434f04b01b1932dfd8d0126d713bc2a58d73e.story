Pull on the white shirt for the Under 21s at a major finals and get international experience of competing for a trophy? Or take a holiday and return in time for a shirt-selling operation in the Middle East or the United States?

We all know the answer. Will Arsene Wenger give his blessing for Jack Wilshere, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Calum Chambers and others to join up with England's junior team at the end of this season, or focus on his team-sheet for the next money-spinning global tour?

Brendan Rodgers will no doubt take Liverpool to glad-hand their Boston-based owners some time before the start of next season and would rather have Raheem Sterling along to show his dazzling smile.

Everton will insist on some rest for Ross Barkley (currently resting while injured) and John Stones (currently resting while injured), Phil Jones will need a break from helping Manchester United defend while most of his team-mates attack and the rest will find something better to do. Like the talented Jonjo Shelvey, who has made it clear that Under 21 football is not for him.

Speak to senior figures at the FA and they will tell you that agents do not want their clients 'stepping back' into the Under 21s for fear of damaging their brand in the money-dash world that is the Premier League.

Under 21 football has long been the place to avoid and the caps nobody wants. Gareth Southgate has set about changing those attitudes and Luke Shaw's performances in the last two games suggest he is making progress. Shaw limped off in his previous game for Manchester United but declared himself fit for duty. Well done to him.

The senior team, however, still robbed Southgate of Chambers, promoting him for matches against San Marino and Estonia — and that sent out the wrong message.

Players born on or after January 1, 1992 are eligible to participate in the 2015 European Under-21 Championship.

This means that some players - such as Jack Wilshere - will be 23 by the time of the tournament.

Yet these players are allowed to play because they were aged 21 or under when the qualification process began.

Southgate is a sensible, intelligent football man. He has guided the Under 21 team into the European Championship finals, where they lost all three games last time. Now they have won 10 games in succession, with players who are not regulars with their clubs, and won their play-off with home and away 2-1 wins against a threatening Croatia.

He is not a coach who wants to add to Roy Hodgson's problems and will take what he is given. He also believes in the unity of the group who have taken England this far and doesn't want 'outsiders'.

But he should still have the chance to pick the best team he can. The seniors are strolling through a pathetically weak qualifying group that is doing nothing to arrest dwindling interest in the national team.

Imagine if a strong Under 21 team won their first trophy since 1984? Holders Spain are out, so are Holland. There are still dangerous opponents, but this might help to reverse a trend of suffocating failure.

This might be the breakthrough we have been looking for.

Many of Roy Hodgson's young England squad would benefit from competitive internationals next summer

The squad would become familiar with the pressures of tournament football before the senior European Championship in France the following summer, when others such as Wayne Rooney, Joe Hart and Theo Walcott would be along to boost the average age. With the next two World Cups at venues unlikely to suit the English travel sickness, the next Euros in France are the biggest chance of progress. Why not look to start the winning habit now?

Burn-out needs to be given thought, but few of the players we are talking about will go the distance with their clubs. Barkley, for instance, is carefully managed by Roberto Martinez. Oxlade-Chamberlain is not an Arsenal regular, Shaw and Chambers must still impress their club managers, despite costing a combined £40million-plus.

It would be a terrible shame if an opportunity of success was lost because the selfish heavyweight Premier League clubs come out on top again. This is England's time.
