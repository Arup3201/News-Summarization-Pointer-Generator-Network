Muslim preacher Robert 'Musa' Cerantonio has taken to the internet to post a string of new extremist messages assuring would-be Islamic State fighters that even if they are killed by a woman they will still go to paradise.

The self-styled 'fake sheik' from Melbourne, who  has an online cult following, was deported from the Philippines in July and has been under close police surveillance since his return to Australia.

The 29-year-old has taken to his account to post his new rants in response to reports  that ISIS fighters fear they will not meet 72 virgins in paradise if they are killed by Kurdish female fighters.

Extremist preacher Robert 'Musa' Cerantonio has taken to a new blog to express his latest set of views

Mr Cerantonio says in his latest post on an online blog that is 'utter nonsense'.

He said: 'There is absolutely nothing in Islam which teaches that a person cannot go to Paradise if killed by a woman. 

'In fact the opposite is more likely to be true, that a person who is killed and dies as a martyr who fought for the sake of Allah is guaranteed a place in Paradise regardless of the gender of the one who kills him.' 

He explains it is 'well known' Prophet Mohammed died after being poisoned by a woman. 

A picture of female Kurdish fighter only known as 'Rehana' went viral earlier this year after it was reported she had killed 'scores' of IS fighters. 

The photo of the young girl, wearing military gear and holding a gun, and showing a victory salute went viral, it was reported she had been beheaded by IS but the rumours turned out to be false.

Cerantonio (pictured) talks about how jihadi fighters will still go to Paradise if they are killed by a woman, Kurdish fighter 'Rehana' (pictured right) was supposedly beheaded by IS but the reports were incorrect 

Police say that although his social media postings are 'considered offensive and disturbing' but have not breached Australian law 

Cerantonio was arrested in central Filipino city of Cebu and later released back to Australia in July 

Mr Cerantonio added: 'So rather than being a barrier to entering Paradise it is proven that the best of mankind who is promised Paradise was a martyr who died due to the attack of a woman.' 

Professor Greg Barton, an expert in radicalisation from Monash University told the Herald Sun that Certantonio's 'charisma and communication skills' were a dangerous threat rather than his intellectual skills.

Cerantonio was born in Melbourne and converted to Islam when he was 17. 

His Twitter account, which boasted around 6000 followers, was closed down in September.  

A spokesman for Victoria Police told Daily Mail Australia: 'We do not discuss individuals who may or may not be of interest to Victoria Police. 

'In saying this we would also like to advise that the safety of all Victorians is of the highest priority for Victoria Police. 

'We remain committed to working collaboratively with the community and other law enforcement and intelligence agencies to ensure the safety and security of the Victorian public.'
