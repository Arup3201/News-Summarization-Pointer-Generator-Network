Britain's women need at least at 15 days more sleep each year than they get, says a new survey.

They feel worse off than men – who reckon they are 10 days short of the ideal sleep ration.

Overall, Britons say they need seven and a half hours a night, but they are getting fewer than six hours 40 minutes.

Experts believe insufficient sleep has become a worldwide epidemic, with chronic sleep deprivation linked to medical problems such as obesity, diabetes, cancer and immune deficiency.

Previous US research even found lack of sleep could double the signs of skin ageing, including fine lines.

The latest survey of 2,000 UK adults showed men claim to get less sleep than women, but also need less time in bed.

The survey showed men were getting 6 hours 3 mins sleep on average, compared with 6 hours 40 mins they believe they should have – a sleep deficit of 40 mins a night.

Over a year, the shortfall would reach 10 days 3 hours.

Women claim to get 6 hours 21 mins each night – but want 7hrs 23 mins.

The sleep deficit of 1 hr 2mins a night adds up to a staggering 15 days 17 hours annually.

The figures emerged in a survey of the nation’s sleeping habits for a new app, iCukoo, which allows users to donate to a charity of their choice every time they hit the snooze button on their phone alarm.

Fewer than half of Britons actually wake up to an alarm clock or phone alarm.

Almost a fifth of people wake naturally, and most of the remainder are awakened by partners, pets or children.

More men than women are woken up by their partners – 11.5 per cent versus 9 per cent – and twice as many women are woken by children – 11 per cent versus 5.5 per cent.

A quarter of those surveyed by OnePoll said they always got a good night’s sleep, but almost one in five were kept awake by work worries, and one in eight had their sleep affected by issues with family or friends.

Snoring by a partner kept one in 10 awake while a further seven per cent suffered because of their own snoring, or conditions such as sleep apnoea.

Inevitably, women suffer far more with snoring partners: 15.5 per cent said this kept them awake, compared with just 6 per cent of men.

One in four people said needing the toilet was the thing guaranteed to get them up.

Research suggests seven and a half hours of sleep a night is the optimum level for good health.

Earlier this year scientists at Surrey University last month found just one week of poor sleep can disrupt hundreds of genes linked to stress, immunity and inflammation.

Other research shows women are more likely to seek help for sleeping problems – but they are twice as likely to become reliant on medication.

Josh Hart of Chelsea Apps Factory, which created iCukoo, said the app would help good causes because every time a user hit the snooze button, a small sum of money was donated to their charity of choice.

He said ‘With so many people struggling to get enough sleep, it’s no wonder so many of us feel the need to snooze every day. ‘Now, using an app, we can use that snooze time to help others and snooze guilt-free!’

Mark Bishop, Director of Fundraising at Prostate Cancer UK, one of the charities involved, said ‘Extreme snoozing is a brilliant way of fundraising if you don’t fancy climbing mountains and skydiving.

‘Prostate Cancer UK is conscious of the clock, with one man dying from the disease every hour in the UK. We cannot afford to hit the snooze button, but our supporters can.’

Paul Jackson-Clark, Director of Fundraising at Parkinson’s UK ‘We all struggle to get out of bed on cold and dark winter mornings, and anything that can make getting up more bearable can only be a good thing.

‘Waking up and snoozing with iCukoo is a fun and simple way to kick-start every day, whilst making a donation to Parkinson’s UK at the same time.’

Laura Lee, Chief Executive of Maggie’s, said: ‘Maggie’s is here for everyone and anyone affected by cancer as well as their family and friends and we are delighted to have been selected as one of iCukoo’s charity partners.’
