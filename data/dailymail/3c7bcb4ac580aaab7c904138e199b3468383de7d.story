All grandparents dream of greatness for their grandchildren - but one man's bet that his baby grandson would one day play international football has paid off in spectacular style.

When sixteen-year-old Welshman Harry Wilson ran out on to the pitch against Belgium last night for his national side, he made history as the youngest-ever player for Wales.

But he also made his grandfather £125,000, and an early retirement, after Peter Edwards, 62, bet £50 in 2000 that his grandson, aged just 18 months, would one day represent his country.

Long-shot: Peter Edwards won £125,000 on odds of 2,500-1 when his son played his first game for Wales

The odds of 2,500-1 did nothing to stop Mr Edwards making the confident bet, and last night's appearance as a substitute confirmed his excellent talent-spotting abilities.

Mr Wilson, who plays in Liverpool FC's under-18s squad, came on in the 87th minute last night before the game concluded as a 1-1 draw between the Welsh and Belgian teams.

Mr Edwards, who services electrical cables for a living, said he retired immediately when his grandson took to the field, while he watched the game on his iPad from his caravan in Buckingham.

He works away from his home in Corwen, North Wales, most of the year and sees his wife Dorothy, 58, just once a fortnight.

But he was able to retire early thanks to his winnings, which he says will be used in part to support Mr Wilson's development as a professional footballer.

He said today: 'I've retired one year early. I have come home now and will not be going back. Not bad for a daft bet.

Record player: Mr Wilson is Wales' youngest-ever national player, beating the record previously held by Gareth Bale

'I retired immediately. I told my manager yesterday that if Harry plays I wouldn't be coming back.'

He said he put on the original bet on a whim after seeing how Harry liked playing with a football even as a toddler.

'He used to chase the ball around the front room on his hands and knees even before he could walk, that's what gave me the idea. But I hoped the bet would come up.'

Young talent: Mr Wilson can be seen being prepped for action by Wales manager Chris Coleman last night

Mr Wilson plays on the left wing, the same as Gareth Bale, the Real Madrid superstar whose record as the youngest Welsh player he beat last night aged just 16 years 207 days, compared to Mr Bale's 16 years 315 days.

Dorothy Edwards said: 'It was a historic moment and very a proud one for the whole family.

'We're delighted for Harry and of course Peter's bet makes it all the better - we had the champagne out last night.

'We all knew Harry would make it one day but no one expected it was going to be quite this soon.

Warming the bench: Mr Wilson, right, came on as a substitute in the 87th minute. He had previously sat out a game against Macedonia.

'It's great that he's broken the record set by Gareth Bale - they are some really big boots to fill.

'He's such a talented boy - he was kicking a football as soon as he was standing up.

'My husband always enjoyed a flutter on the horses and on the football 
and one day he just decided he was going to place the bet.

'It's something which has really paid off now.'

Mr Edwards also revealed that he tried to make a second bet on Harry's prospects at the William Hill shop in Wrexham, but was politely refused in light on Harry's more obvious talents.

He said: 'Harry was about 12 then. But they turned me down and said I already had a substantial bet with them. But they threw in England as a gesture of goodwill.'

It meant even if the teenager had opted to play for England, something he could have done because his grandmother was born in Chester, the pay-out would have been safe.

Mr Edwards said: 'This means I will be able to help Harry out. You can be quite sure that he will get a share of it.'

A William Hill spokesman said: 'Peter has been able to quit his job as a result of his amazing ability to spot fledgling talent earlier than almost anyone else we've ever taken a bet from.'
