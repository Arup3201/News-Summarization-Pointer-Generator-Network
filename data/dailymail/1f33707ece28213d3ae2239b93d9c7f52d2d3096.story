Cyprus was on the brink of going bust last night as its teetering government faced a growing clamour to ditch the euro.

As
horrified islanders faced new limits on cashpoint withdrawals and a ban
on taking money out of the country, a poll showed more than two-thirds 
now want to leave the single currency and turn to Russia for help.

Last
night, as one bank was said to have just a ‘few hours’ left before it 
runs out of cash, politicians were scrambling to cobble together a ‘Plan
B’ to avoid a bankruptcy that would send shockwaves through the 
European banking system.

They insisted they will not go 
ahead with a plan drawn up in Brussels to confiscate up to 10 per cent 
of every bank deposit, branded the ‘great EU bank robbery’.

There
was growing concern that Germany’s attempt to strongarm the 
Mediterranean island, already blamed for undermining confidence in banks
across the Continent, is turning into a geopolitical blunder of 
historic proportions.

Even
if an emergency bank restructure – which could mean big deposit holders
losing almost half of their savings – goes ahead, Cyprus will need to 
raise billions by next week to avoid collapse.

Credit ratings agency Standard & Poor’s cut its rating on Cyprus to CCC, which means it risks defaulting on its debts.

Yesterday
there were extraordinary reports that Cypriot leaders were refusing to 
take calls from the European Central Bank. Instead, they were locked in 
talks with Vladimir Putin’s government about a Russian bailout.

Russian depositors have huge sums in Cyprus’s banks, which critics say have become a haven for tax evasion and money laundering.

Finance
minister Michael Sarris has been in Moscow attempting to negotiate 
rescue package and was said to be willing to offer access to financial 
assets and gas deposits as part of any agreement.

Energy minister George Lakkotrypis is also in Moscow, ostensibly to attend a tourism exhibition.

A
poll for a Cypriot TV station showed that 67.3 per cent say the country
should leave the euro and tighten relations with Russia, which is 
desperate to regain influence in the eastern Mediterranean and Middle 
East.

As extra police were drafted in to 
control angry crowds outside the parliament in Nicosia, protesters 
brandished placards reading ‘No to Fourth Reich’ and ‘Better die on your
feet than live on your knees’.

The
Bank of Cyprus, the country’s biggest bank, warned the island needed a 
‘liquidity lifeline’ which would make the difference between ‘salvation 
or destruction’.

Cyprus
Popular Bank announced limit on ATM withdrawals of 260 euros per 
customer. Banks, which have been shut all week to prevent mass 
withdrawals, are to stay closed until Tuesday.

Last
night an emergency Bill submitted to parliament gave the finance 
minister or central bank governor the right to impose capital controls 
on banks – a ban on moving cash outside the country, which would be a 
serious blow to the single market.

The European Central Bank warned it may halt emergency funding on Monday if Cyprus fails to come up with a viable rescue plan.

Eurozone
finance officials acknowledged being ‘in a mess’, and discussed 
imposing capital controls to insulate the region from a possible Cypriot
collapse. One described emotions as running ‘very high’ and referred to
‘open talk’ of Cyprus leaving the eurozone.

In an unprecedented snub, Cyprus decided not to take part in a conference call with EU leaders.

‘If Cyprus does not even feel that they can attend the call it is a big problem for us,’ one French representative said.

It
is thought that Cyprus’s ‘Plan B’ to avoid bankruptcy will mean 
depositors with account balances in excess of 100,000 euros would be hit
hard. Cyprus Popular Bank and the Bank of Cyprus would be split to 
create a ‘bad bank’.

Insured
deposits – below the EU ceiling of 100,000 euros, supposedly guaranteed
in the event of a bank collapse – would go into a ‘good bank’ and not 
sustain losses, while uninsured deposits would go into the bad bank and 
be frozen until assets could be sold. Losses to depositors could reach 
40 per cent.

Restocked: Cypriots still have access to cash for now as bank machines which were emptied at the weekend have been restocked

John Cridland, director-general
of the Confederation of British Industry, said last night that the 
proposal for a levy on bank deposits in Cyprus had ‘created a real mess’
and ‘undermined the confidence of ordinary depositors’.

He
added: ‘The events are a stark reminder that not only has the eurozone 
crisis not gone away but also how much Europe and the eurozone countries
in particular, are going through a period of rapid transformation.’

Asked
if the bailout row would sour relations between Moscow and the EU, 
Sergei Aleksashenko, a former bank governor and now an economist at 
Moscow’s Higher School of Economics, replied: ‘It’s not possible to 
damage what does not exist.’
