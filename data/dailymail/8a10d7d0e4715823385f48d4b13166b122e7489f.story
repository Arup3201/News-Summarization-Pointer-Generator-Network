He is still at school but is fast becoming the go-to-guy for predicting what Apple will release next.

Mark Gurman, 18, is so interested in technology - and, specifically, Apple products - that he writes in his spare time for website 9to5Mac.

In four weeks alone, the teenager correctly predicted seven out of eight announcements that the tech giant then made at the Worldwide Developers Conference in San Francisco on Monday.

By any reporter's standards, that is some hit rate, especially when his eighth prediction has not been proven incorrect and could still come true.

But when you consider that Mark is attending high school in Los Angeles, it is fast making him something of a celebrity as Apple fans seek out a reliable source for what lies in store.

On May 11, Mark claimed that Apple would announce that its forthcoming iOS 6 operating system would ditch Google Maps and replace it with its own in-house 3D version.

That same day, he said the iCloud would include web versions of Apple's Notes and Reminders apps.

On May 14, he predicted the Culvertino-based firm would revamp its 15-inch MacBook Pro with an ultra-thin design, retina display and super-fast USB 3.

Eight days before the Worldwide Developers Conference, on June 4, he predicted that Apple would introduce its voice-activated Siri control system on the iPad; that Facebook would be integrated into iOS 6; and that the firm would introduce an revamped line of MacBooks.

And a day later, he claimed Apple would update its Mac Pro after two years without an update.

All of the above were proved to be correct when Apple top executives took the stage at the Worldwide Developers Conference on Monday.

The only prediction yet to be proven, was Mark's May 15 claim that Apple is working on MacBook Airs and iMacs with retina displays.However, this could still be correct.

So, where does Mark get his information from? A combination of Apple insider information and poring over documents searching for 'giveaway' titbits.
