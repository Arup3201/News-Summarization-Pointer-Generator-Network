The Olympic row between the U.S. and China rolled on today as the personal details of the American swimming coach who questioned the gold-medal success of Chinese swimmer Ye Shiwen were shared with 15 million bloggers.

The home and work addresses, phone numbers and email of John Leonard were posted to Sina Weibo, a Chinese Twitter-like site.

The information was posted by Kaifu Lee who once ran Google in China. He has since deleted Tuesday's post but not before it was retweeted 14,000 times.

Mr Lee wrote that he had read numerous articles on 16-year-old swimmer Ye Shiwen and that all were 'relentless attacks from John Leonard'.

According to the BBC, he then wrote:  'John Leonard should apologize. Below 
are his background and contact details. If you want to contact him, I 
suggest using civilised and factual approach.'

Twitter user @fryan reported that among the responses to Mr Lee's remarks on Weibo were Internet users telling others to hack into Mr Leonard's computer and even one chilling comment saying the coach should be killed. 

The post was also picked up by users on Twitter many of whom expressed outrage at Mr Lee's actions. 

Mr Lee has since issued an apology, saying he did not want to tarnish China's image.

Row: Chinese swimmer Shiwen Ye has won two gold medals but American coach John Leonard cast doubt on her success

Counter-attack: Michael Phelps, who became the greatest-ever Olympian after winning 15 golds, was criticized for his stunning performance by a former Olympic team doctor in China

He wrote on Weibo: 'I apologize for the inappropriateness of my actions, and any inconveniences this may have caused John. At the same time, I sincerely hope that John would also consider an apology to Ye Shiwen.'

Describing Miss Ye as a 'superwoman', Mr Leonard, executive director of the World Swimming Coaches Association, triggered the controversy on Monday by casting doubt on her performance.

Miss Ye's extraordinary swim came in the 400m individual medley, in which she managed the last 50m of the freestyle leg in 28.93 seconds – compared with the 29.1 seconds 27-year-old American swimmer Ryan Lochte managed in the men's event minutes earlier.

Leonard suggested the performance was reminiscent of swimmers at previous Olympics who had subsequently been caught for using performance-enhancing drugs.

Miss Ye denied accusations that she has ever used substances, saying that her success comes from rigorous training five hours a day, for nine years.

Information superhighway: Sina Weibo, started in 2009, is China's leading micro-blogging site and is used by more than 300 million Chinese

Earlier this week, British journalist Guy Adams was kicked off Twitter after he posted the email address for an NBC executive following a row over Olympic coverage.

Adams called the network 'utter, utter b******s' on his Twitter page and encouraged his followers to email NBC's Olympics President Gary Zenkel with their complaints.

The site responded by promptly shutting down Adams' account. However the company later apologised and reinstated the journalist's feed.

Since the start of the London 2012 Games, China and the U.S. have entered a tit-for-tat over their Olympic swimming champions.

Earlier this week, a former Chinese Olympic team doctor suggested that U.S. champion Michael Phelps may have used performance-enhancing drugs.

Doctor Chen Zhanghao, who led medical staff at four previous games, said he believed Phelps, who is now the greatest-ever Olympian, was guilty of doping - but had no evidence for his claims.
