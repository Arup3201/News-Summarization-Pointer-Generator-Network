It is mentioned in the works of Shakespeare and Chaucer – and celebrated in the  carol Twelve Days Of Christmas – but the  turtle dove is in danger of becoming extinct in Britain.

The number of breeding pairs in the UK is thought to have dropped this year to a record low of below 14,000, marking a 84 per cent drop since 1995.

The birds are now found in just a few areas of southern England, mostly in Norfolk, Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire, Oxfordshire and Suffolk.

A spokesman for the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds said: ‘The turtle dove is the fastest declining bird in this country  and within ten years we could lose this icon of the British countryside completely.’ 

Known for its gentle purring call, the turtle dove has a narrow diet consisting mostly of seeds from weedy plants which are gradually being killed off in Britain by modern herbicides used in intensive farming.

There is little respite in their wintering grounds in mid-Africa which are lacking in food because of over-farming. Many are also being killed off by a disease called avian  trichomoniasis.

And hunters in Malta and Cyprus shoot the birds as they return to Britain following their migration.

Simon Tonkin, the RSPB’s farmland 
adviser, heads the charity’s Operation Turtle Dove project which 
encourages farmers to re-plant the bird’s natural habitats. He said: 
‘There is now a very real possibility of losing this beautiful bird from
Britain  completely, which would be terrible.

‘Their
call is very distinctive – it is a warm purring sound that sums up a 
British summer’s evening for many people. The challenge is to provide 
food and habitat for them when they are here from May until late August 
or early September.

‘Of
course, we think of them at Christmas because of the carol but instead 
of singing “two turtle doves”, we might soon being singing “no turtle 
doves”.’
