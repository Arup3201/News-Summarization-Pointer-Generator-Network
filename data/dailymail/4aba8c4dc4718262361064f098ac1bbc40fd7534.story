Firing six bullets into her boyfriend, twice in the head and four more times to stop the twitching, detectives say Shayna Hubers admitted giving him the nose job he always wanted.

Testifying at a preliminary hearing for murder on Thursday, Highland Heights, Kentucky, Detective Bill Birkenhauer revealed that while the 21-year-old from Lexington, changed her story a few times, her intent has remained.

'She said she gave him the nose job he wanted,' he said according to Cincinnati.com. 'She said she couldn't stand to see him deformed (after shooting him in the face.) She said he was vain.'

She also said it was in self defense.

Grave charge:  Firing six shots Shayna Hubers, left, is accused of murdering her boyfriend, 29-year-old attorney Ryan Poston, right, in what she says was self defense

Crime scene: Police say Hubers gunned down Poston inside his Highland Heights, Ohio, condominium

Her boyfriend of one year Ryan 
Poston, 29, a local attorney, was found dead at the scene with his 
family claiming the victim had an on and off relationship with Hubers 
that he was most recently trying to end.

On
October 12, she called police to the scene 15 minutes after shooting 
him according to Detective Birkenhauer who said she told him that they had been arguing when 
Poston became verbally abusive toward her.

Birkenhauer said Hubers shot him from across his kitchen table not once, but six 
times, with at least three guns found residing in the condominium.

One of those guns, hanging on Poston's bed, was loaded. It
was in that room Birkenhauer said Poston retreated, locking him inside
before Hubers told police she used a key to open the door.

'I’m
quite concerned about the safety of the community,' Judge Karen Thomas 
said of her decision to revoke Hubers' bond that had been increased to $5million. 'She has no ties to this community.

Seated
in the front of the courtroom were Hubers' parents, Sharon and Robert 
Hubers from Kentucky, who were described by her attorney to be ready to 
do anything to get their daughter out.

Troubled: Poston's family described his relationship with Hubers, left, as tumultuous and said that the 29-year-old was trying to end it

Gristly: Hubers allegedly told police she shot her boyfriend in the face and then fired again to put him out of his misery

As new details emerge many are still quite foggy, however, at least according to Birkenhauer.

The whereabouts of the gun used in the crime for instance, a .38-caliber handgun, is so far uncertain.

'She
made numerous statements,' Birkenhauer said. 'She said the gun was in 
his hand at one time. She said the gun was in the cabinet.'

Bold claim: Hubers' attorney said that the 21-year-old was never prone to violence and shot Poston in self-defense

She also said the gun used was at one time on the kitchen table, 'although that story changed quite a few times,' he said.

Hubers was found unharmed at the scene and admitted to police of having torn her boyfriend's shirt during their argument.

Hubers stopped police while they were
questioning her to tell them that she shot her boyfriend in the face 
and then fired again to put him out of his misery, according to the 
report.

'I’m
not going to talk about the facts of the case, except to say that it is
a self-defense case. The only thing she did wrong was having bad taste 
in men,' said defense attorney Wil Zevely. '...She is a very young and 
kind person. She would never do anything violent: never has, never 
would.'

The attorney said 
his client and Poston had dated for at least a year. The victim’s family
and friends described the relationship as 'tumultuous' and 
'on-and-off.

'Please keep in mind that the real victim in this tragedy is Ryan Poston, not the woman who shot him multiple times,' his family said in a statement cited by WKRC. 'Anyone who ever knew Ryan knows her claims of self-defense are absurd. We look forward to the day when the truth comes out in a court of law, not from the mouth of a criminal defense lawyer trying his case in the media.'

Hubers previously appearing in court on October 16 via video from the Campbell County jail. No plea was entered, but a visiting judge reduced her bond from $2million cash to $1million cash or $2million property. Later that day, however, Hubers’ bond amount was increased to $5million by the regular judge.

Poston graduated from Salmon P. Chase College of Law, Northern Kentucky University in 2008, following in the footsteps of his grandfather and uncle. In May, he started his own law practice specializing in personal injury cases in downtown Cincinnati, Ohio.

'He had a strong feeling of wanting to 
help people who wouldn't otherwise have access to the legal system and 
who might be steamrolled by the legal system without someone there to 
help them,' said attorney Kenneth G. Hawley, who worked across the hall 
from Poston.

His family and friends have described
him as a bright and hard-working young lawyer who had a promising 
future ahead of him. He is survived by his parents and three sisters.

One
of his friends, Matthew Herren, told the Kentucky Enquirer that he 
wouldn't have been surprised if Poston had run for Congress at a young 
age.

Hubers graduated from Lexington’s Paul Laurence Dunbar High School in 2009.

In the fall of 2010, she made the Dean’s List at the University of Kentucky as a sophomore psychology major. Zevely said she is close with her parents, and her mother spent the day with her in Northern Kentucky prior to the shooting.

A friend talking to the station WKYT described Hubers as a quiet and sweet girl who was smarter than most of her classmates.
