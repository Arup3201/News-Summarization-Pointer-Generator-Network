A brave rape victim has spoken out about her horrific ordeal in a bid to help others after she was attacked by a man because 'he was bored'.

Student Taylor Walker, 22, was walking through her dormitory carpark at Vanderbilt University, in Nashville, Tennessee, on a Friday evening in March 2012 when 25-year-old Tyrone Batts pounced from the shadows as she approached her car.

As he forced her inside the vehicle and raped her she thought of reaching for the pepper spray in her handbag. But she couldn't move.

'The big responses are fight or flight,' she told The Tennessean. 'But a huge one during rape is
freeze. It’s just the most powerless thing ever.'

Ordeal: Taylor Walker, a 22-year-old Vanderbilt graduate, has spoken out about her horrific rape in a bid to help others after she was attacked by a man because 'he was bored'

But it wasn't until the ordeal was over that Batts did something that chilled her to her core.

'He kissed me on the head before he left,' she said. 'That was just the craziest 
thing. Like, you just did that and you’re going to act like this is a 
tender moment?'

He then demanded she give him the $22 in her purse and skulked off into the night.

When Batts was arrested he allegedly told police he approached her because 'he was bored'.

More staggering still, he also claimed the encounter was consensual and that Miss Walker has 'given him a look' before he came over.

Attack: Miss Walker was walking through a carpark at Vanderbilt University, in Nashville, Tennessee, on a Friday evening in March 2012 when Tyrone Batts, 25, pounced from the shadows as she approached her car

'It's just the most powerless thing ever': As Batts forced Miss Walker inside the vehicle and raped her she thought of reaching for the pepper spray in her handbag. But she couldn't move

At the time of the assault, Batts was already on bail for aggravated robbery and attempted rape in 2001. And before the weekend was through, police claim, he would attack and rob three more women in the carparks of three nearby hospitals.

He has pleaded not guilty and awaits hearings on all of the charges having been transferred to a mental health clinic to determine if he is capable of standing trial.

In the aftermath of the attack, Miss Walker became unrecognisable to herself. She became too terrified to go outside and became a recluse, imprisoned by her own fear. She says she stopped dressing up or wearing make up because, thereafter, she simply 'didn't care' about her appearance.

But now the law graduate says she has turned a corner after a year of therapy to help handle her anxiety and gradually return to a normal life.

Fighting back: Miss Walker, a law graduate, has now become an advocate for rape victims and is soon to train as a lawyer to 'put the needs of victims first' in a country where, she says, rape is an 'epidemic'

Trying to help others: Miss Walker says that, while she may never 'recover' from the ordeal, she is on the way to creating 'a new normal' and wants to share her experience with others 'less lucky' than her

'I do not remember who I was before the rape,' she said. 'I do not remember who that girl was.'

Now she says, while she may never 'recover' from the ordeal, she is on the way to creating 'a new normal' and wants to share her experience with others 'less lucky' than her.

'I’m past the point of feeling shameful about it,' she said. 'Because it’s not even my shame to carry.

'For me, it would almost be dishonest not to come forward and say who I am. I want people to know, number one, that I have nothing to hide. And it’s not my fault.'

She has now become an advocate for rape victims and is soon to train as a lawyer to 'put the needs of victims first'.

'Rape and sexual assault [in America] is an epidemic,' she added. 'In order for a victim of any sort of crime to heal they need each step along that process to be the best it can be.

'That means we need to have good police officers, we need good hospital staff, you need to have good attorneys that understand, and you need to have counselors. And all of those need to work together.'
