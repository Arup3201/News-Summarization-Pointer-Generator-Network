MPs and council officials in Essex have expressed their disbelief after it emerged that disgraced former peer Lord Hanningfield is still receiving his £11,500 councillor allowance despite being jailed for fiddling his Parliamentary expenses.

The shamed Lord, real name Paul White, 70, was jailed for nine months last week after he was found guilty of illegally claiming £13,379 in parliamentary expenses.

But despite the scandal he has still not resigned his post at Essex County Council.

Still being paid: Lord Hanningfield, centre, remains in his post at 
Essex County Council despite being jailed over his expenses claims

Lord Hanningfield, a former pig 
farmer from West Hanningfield, near Chelmsford in Essex, was convicted 
in May of six counts of false accounting relating to his House of Lords 
expenses.

However, despite being jailed he has retained his place as Essex County Councillor for the village of Stock - and is still receiving his councillor allowance of £11,500.

On ECC's website it states that 
councillors receive their allowance so they can do their duties, which 
includes 'being accessible and available to all residents in their 
electoral division'.

But although he is under pressure to resign 
from his post the council have said they are powerless to suspend or axe Lord Hanningfield until an 
appeal against his conviction is complete.

Councillor Mike Mackrory, Liberal Democrat deputy leader on Essex County Council, said the former Conservative peer should do the 'honourable thing' and step down.

He said, 'It cannot be right that Lord Hanningfield will continue to receive his £11,500 a year allowance whilst serving his prison sentence.

'He cannot represent people in his ward from a prison cell so he should not be a councillor. He should do the honourable thing and resign his seat and save further embarrassment to Essex County Council.

'This would cause a by-election to be held, which would enable the 13,500 electors of Stock to be properly represented again at County Hall as soon as possible,' Cllr Mackrory added.

"The CPS said Hanningfield's case was one of the most clear cut examples of expenses fraud so he doesn't have a leg to stand on.'

Bob Russell, MP for Colchester, said: 'I think most people would be amazed that someone in prison can remain a councillor.

'The judge has sentenced him to a term of imprisonment which should be an automatic disqualification.'

Emma Boon, a spokeswoman for the Taxpayers' Alliance, said: 'It's absurd to have a county councillor being paid while he is in jail. How can he be serving taxpayers while he is in jail?

'It's unacceptable that he's allowed to stay in his position once he's been convicted as a criminal. There's no way he should be allowed to continue as a county councillor.'

Claims: Lord Hanningfield stayed at his home in Chelmsford, Essex, while claiming for overnight stays for his work at the House of Lords

Essex County Council has confirmed that Lord Hanningfield is still being paid councillor expenses pending the outcome of his appeal.

A spokeswoman said: 'Essex County Council is now awaiting the outcome of Lord Hanningfield's application for leave to appeal his conviction.

'In the meantime we are continuing to co-operate with the police over the ongoing Essex investigation and it would not be appropriate for us to comment until that is complete.'

Lord Hanningfield was found guilty of six counts of 
false accounting in May and joins four ex-MPs and a fellow member of the
Lords convicted of dishonestly obtaining thousands of pounds from the 
taxpayer.

Lord Hanningfield, an unmarried 
ex-Lords opposition frontbencher and former leader of Essex County 
Council, has lodged an appeal.

He denied fraudulently claiming parliamentary expenses totalling nearly £14,000 
between March 2006 and May 2009. The charges relate to six individual 
one month periods.

The
peer claimed £13,379 in parliamentary expenses for overnight stays in London 
when he was not in the capital, as well as £382 in train fares and £147 in mileage by 
doubling the seven-mile distance from his house to the railway station.

He
told his trial that he treated the Lords expenses for staying overnight
in London as an allowance for living outside the capital and spent just
'a minute a month' completing his claim forms.

He
alleged that most other peers treated the House of Lords as a 'club', 
turning up there for only 10 minutes to claim their daily allowance.

Prison term: Lord Hanningfield was jailed for nine months despite claims he was in poor health

The shamed peer insisted his 
parliamentary duties left him thousands of pounds out of pocket and said
he 'averaged out' his claims to recoup some of the money he spent.

When
he was questioned by detectives, he told them to look at the records of
other peers and claimed he was not the only one claiming expenses in 
this way.

Unmarried Lord 
Hanningfield told the trial that public service was his life and he 
worked very long hours on Lords and county council business.

He
said he re-mortgaged his bungalow to fight the case and was living on a
modest pension because he 'never got round to signing the forms' for 
the local government pension to which he was entitled.

But prosecutors rejected the peer's 
'feeble excuse' for his 'blatantly dishonest' behaviour, saying that 
peers are meant to serve the public and 'not top up their income at the 
public's expense'.

Four 
former Labour MPs - David Chaytor, Eric Illsley, Jim Devine and Elliot 
Morley - have already received prison terms for fiddling their 
parliamentary expenses.

Illsley
has already been released from jail, and Chaytor was freed from Spring 
Hill open prison, near Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, on the day Lord 
Hanningfield was convicted after serving just a quarter of his 18-month 
sentence.

Another Conservative peer, Lord Taylor of Warwick, was jailed for 12 months and faces being suspended from the House of Lords.

In
mitigation, defence counsel Alun Jones said Lord Hanningfield had been 
convicted of offences over a period of six out of 72 months.

He
said: 'He is convicted of dishonesty in six months of the prosecution's
own choosing out of 72 months when the reality is that this man has 
actually given his own money for public service for all the 40 years he 
has been involved in it.'

Mr Jones said it was 'unjust and cruel' to jail Lord Hanningfield because of his old age and ill health.
