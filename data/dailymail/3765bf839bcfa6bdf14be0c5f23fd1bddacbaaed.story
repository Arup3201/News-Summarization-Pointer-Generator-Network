It is often called the best kept secret in the City - company shares that come with lucrative perks.

From discounted theme park tickets to Marks & Spencer shopping vouchers, firms are ramping up the freebies they hand out to small shareholders.

Investors in luxury goods group Mulberry can get up to a fifth off its wares – potentially saving £300 on a £1,500 designer handbag.

Incentive: Anybody who holds 250 shares in Mulberry can get 10 per cent off purchases worth more than £500

More than 40 companies listed on the London Stock Exchange now offer such perks, according to Hargreaves Lansdown.

Richard Hunter, head of equities at the stockbroker, said the trend became particularly popular in the 1990s.

He said: ‘Companies jumped on the bandwagon as a means of getting to their shareholder base - after all, it is likely that a shareholder of the company will also be a customer.’

Even though the perks culture peaked before the turn of the century, many companies still offer enticements to investors, he added.

The most recent example is Merlin Entertainments, which owns attractions across the UK including Madame Tussauds, Alton Towers, Thorpe Park and the London Eye.

The company floated last week, and anyone buying more than 1,000 shares - which cost around 348p each – is entitled to a 30 per cent discount on up to two annual passes which give unlimited entry to the firm’s 31 UK attractions.

But companies differ in how many shares are required to gain the extras. Groups such as M&S, Moss Bros and Legal & General say their discounts are open to all shareholders.

Others require a minimum level of investment, and place conditions on the benefits.

High street clothing giant Next requires investors to own 500 shares, which currently have an eye-watering total value of £27,475, to be able to claim its 25 per cent discount – and the offer lasts only between  April and the end of October,  so cannot be used in the Christmas rush.

Larger size clothing retailer N Brown, which trades under brand names including Simply Be, High and Mighty and underwear label Figleaves, increases the discount shareholders can claim based on the number of shares they own.

Other companies offer more unusual rewards. National Grid says its shareholders are entitled to go on a two-day annual visit each December to its sites around the country.

Anyone holding more than 250 shares - worth around £2,400 - in pubs and brewing group Fuller, Smith & Turner can get a 10 per cent discount when booking to stay in any of its venues, with further offers on its food and drink.

P&O owner Carnival offers credit that can be spent on board its cruises, but investors still have to pay full whack when booking their holiday. Others, such as chocolatier Thorntons or Frankie & Benny’s owner Restaurant Group, say they offer discounts periodically to investors.

But the cost of offering such jaunts and freebies has led some firms to roll back the offers.

British Airways used to give a discount of 10 per cent for shareholders of its parent company IAG - but the scheme is under review and the company last night couldn’t say whether it would continue.

Mr Hunter warned that ‘perks are not a reason to buy shares’ and investment decisions should be based on key measures such as dividend and capital growth.
