A model has given a homeless puppy a second chance in life  after discovering the paralyzed pooch dragging its hind legs across a beach in Thailand.

Meagan Penman, 22, from Ottawa,  found the paraplegic dog on a beach in Hua Hin suffering from a broken back and with grisly infected wounds on his legs.

But after local animal shelters refused to take the dog, who Meagan named Leo, she made a vow to rescue the poorly pet and take him home with her to Canada to find him a permanent home.

Leo has made a miraculous recovery since he was found on a Thai beach, and he has even been fitted with a wheelchair which means he is able to walk again without dragging his hind legs across the ground

The blonde model raised more than $5,000 on crowd funding websites to pay for veterinary care to treat the dog's injuries at a clinic in Thailand.

And more than three months after she found him, Meagan finally welcomed Leo onto Canadian soil last month - and she has since found him a foster home with Jamie Smith.

Meagan said: 'I was just walking along the beach and saw what looked like half a dog sticking out of a small tide pool - I couldn't understand what I was looking at so I went to have a closer look.

'I realized then he was paralyzed and tried to find a rescue center in the area to take him - but not one would. So I decided then that I would try to take him home with me.

'I really didn't know what I was getting myself into at first but next thing I knew I was in the middle of a huge process that took months to finally pull off.

'There were times where I was so stressed and frustrated but I would not let myself take no for an answer.

'So many people told me he would be better off put down, but you cant put a value on a life. 

'He was in such distress and I couldn't just ignore this kind of neglect. No animal deserves a life like that.

Leo was found on a beach in Hua Hin dragging his hind legs due to injuries that prevented him from walking

Leo suffered a broken back, as well as painful wounds to both of his legs - but Meagan raised money for him to be treated at a clinic in Thailand

'And Leo was so desperate for any kind of human contact, it was heartbreaking, he is such a sweet dog.'

After Leo arrived in Canada last month, Meagan set out to find him a permanent foster home - as she was unable to dedicate enough time to him herself.

And Leo now lives with Jamie Smith in Sarnia, Canada - which is around eight hours away from Meagan's home in Ottawa.

Thanks to crowdfunding, Leo was treated for his injuries in Thailand and has found a home in Canada

But the pup is making a miraculous recovery and has even been fitted with a wheelchair which means he is able to walk again, without scraping his hind legs across the floor.

Meagan said: 'He still has some health issues that are being dealt with but he is doing really well.

'Jamie has alot of time for him and they are really enjoying each others company, they go for many walks and he gets to go to the park and chase squirrels.

'I am so happy that he ended up with her, they are great for each other. And I am hoping to make the journey to visit them in the next couple of months.'
