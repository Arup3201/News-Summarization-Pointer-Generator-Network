A concept artist has painted crockery onto contortionists as part of a launch campaign for Macmillan's 24th World's Biggest Coffee Morning.

Emma Fay created the incredible body art celebrating the nation's love of hot drinks ahead of the charity event on Friday. The fundraiser will see more than 200,000 people hosting a coffee morning with proceeds going to the cancer charity.

Emma created the images symbolising an alternative coffee morning by ornately painting a mug, cupcake, tea pot and teacup onto human bodies.

Participants of the World's Biggest Coffee Morning will drink an estimated 5million cups of coffee and eat 10million slices of cake with the aim of raising more than £20million for people affected by cancer. 

At 24 years old, the event is the most successful charity fundraising event of its kind, raising more than £113million to date.

The idea is simple: Get together with friends, colleagues or neighbours to hold a coffee morning and raise money for Macmillan. In 2013, 154,000 people signed up, raising a record £20million. 

Many coffee shops are also taking part to help raise funds.

Every donation helps the charity continue providing services to ensure that no-one has to face cancer alone, from the moment they’re diagnosed, through treatment and beyond.
