Blow: Canadian Environment Minister Peter Kent announced his country was withdrawing from the Kyoto Protocol last night

Canada has abandoned the Kyoto Protocol on climate change as it bids to protect the third largest oil reserves in the world.

Environment minister Peter Kent said Canada was invoking the legal right to withdraw and would be saving the country $14billion in penalties for not achieving its Kyoto targets.

The Conservative government is reluctant to hurt Canada's booming oil sands sector - which holds more than 170 billion barrels - with daily production expected to more than double by 2025.

Canada becomes the first nation to formally renounce the protocol, although Japan and Russia have also indicated they would not accept new Kyoto commitments after the protocol expires at the end of 2012.

Mr Kent said: 'The Kyoto Protocol does not cover the world's largest two emitters - the U.S. and China - and therefore cannot work.

'It's now clear that Kyoto is not the path forward to a global solution to climate change. If anything it's an impediment.

'To meet the targets under Kyoto for 2012 would be the equivalent of either removing every car, truck, ATV, tractor, ambulance, police car and vehicle of every kind from Canadian roads or closing down the entire farming and agriculture sector and cutting heat to every home, office, hospital, factory and building in Canada.'

Currently, Canada produces 1.5million barrels from the oil sands a day. Only Saudi Arabia and Venezuela have more reserves.

Critics say the enormous amount of energy and water needed in the extraction process increases greenhouse gas emissions, meaning Canada will only be more likely to fall foul of the carbon dioxide targets in the future.

There is also the possibility that further global warming could make it easier to extract the oil in hard-to-access areas where the Arctic conditions make it difficult to drill or strip out.

Target: The protocol required 37 countries to commit to reducing their greenhouse gas output to 1990 levels by the end of next year (file picture)

Mr Kent's announcement comes a day after marathon climate talks finished in the South African city of Durban.

Negotiators from nearly 200 countries agreed on a deal that sets the world on a path to sign a new climate treaty by 2015 to replace the Kyoto Protocol, which expires at the end of next year.

Canada's previous Liberal government signed the accord, but current prime minister Stephen Harper's Conservative government has never accepted it.

The accord requires countries to give a year's notice to withdraw.

Much heralded: Then prime minister Jean Chretien received a standing ovation after the protocol was ratified in 2002. Kyoto did not include the U.S. or China

The Kyoto Protocol was signed in 1997 in Japan and ratified by most major countries except the U.S. and China. It only came into force in February, 2005.

It committed 37 industrialised nations to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions to below 1990 levels and provided financial help to developing countries to accomplish the task.

Although Canada ratified the accord, it was not on track to meet its targets as emissions climbed while the economy expanded.

The protocol will continue to be in effect until the end of 2012, despite Canada quitting.

While many city authorities in Canada approved the decision, others accused the government of destabilising future action on global warming.

Greenpeace Canada spokesman Mike Hudema said in a written statement the Harper government 'has imposed a death sentence on many of the world's most vulnerable populations by pulling out of Kyoto'.

He added: 'This is a further signal that the Harper government is more concerned about protecting polluters than people.'

New Democratic Party environment critic Megan Leslie said the costs for Canada to say in Koyoto were 'absolutely made up'.

She told CBCNews: 'What this is really about is the fact that our government is abdicating its international obligations.

'It's like we're the kid who's failing the class so we have to drop it before that happens.'
