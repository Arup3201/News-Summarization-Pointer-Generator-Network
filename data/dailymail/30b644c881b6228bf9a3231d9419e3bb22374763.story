Mitt Romney has re-emerged on the national political stage 18 months after he lost a presidential bid to President Barack Obama - and he came out swinging.

Romney blasted Hillary Clinton as 'clueless' Sunday for her support of the release of five Guantanamo detainees for U.S. Army soldier Bowe Bergdahl.

He also had harsh words for the Obama Administration and Clinton's tenure as Secretary of State for failing to use American power to protect the country.Â

Still swinging: Mitt Romney pulled no punches criticizing Hillary Clinton, who he deems the most likely Democratic opponent in 2016

Appearing on NBC's Meet the Press, Romney - who has kept a low profile since losing the 2012 Presidential election to Obama - said: 'This administration, from Secretary Clinton to President Obama, has repeatedly underestimated the threats that are faced by America.

'It has repeatedly underestimated our adversaries. And whether that's Russia or (Syrian President Bashar) Assad or ISIS or al-Qaida itself, it has not taken the action necessary to prevent things from happening. We have not used our influence to do what's necessary to protect our interests.'

While Romney pounded Obama with criticism, he reserved most of his harsh words for Clinton - who is widely thought to be the front-runner for the 2016 Presidential election.

'I believe the playbook is to look at her record. I think you have to consider what's happened around the world when she was Secretary of State. And it's been a monumental bust.

'And then her most recent comments... she was asked whether the Bowe Bergdahl trade was one that presented a threat to the United States. And she came back with a clueless answer. She was clueless.

Hillary Clinton, pictured last week, was blasted for her comments while on tour promoting her book, Hard Choices: A Memoir

'She said, "Look, these commandos don't represent a threat to the United States." Well, of course they do. And then she went on to say, "They only represent a threat to Afghanistan and Pakistan." Are you kidding? I mean, we're in Afghanistan. And we're in Afghanistan in part to protect America's security.

'I think her clueless comments about the Bergdahl exchange as well as her record as the secretary of state are really going to be the foundation of how a Republican candidate is able to take back the White House.'

Romney spoke from Park City, Utah, where he hosted a Republican fundraiser attended by a slew of 2016 heavy hitters, including New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, Kentucky Senator Rand Paul, Ohio Senator Rob Portman, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and Romney's former running mate, Wisconsin Congressman Paul Ryan.

Despite this, he roundly dismissed any suggestion he planned to run for president a third time.
