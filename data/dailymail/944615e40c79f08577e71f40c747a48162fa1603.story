George Osborne today hailed a surprise fall in inflation to a five-year low which means a rise in interest rates could be delayed until the middle of next year.

Cheaper travel, restaurants, books and gadgets like tablets and laptops meant the CPI rate of inflation was just 1.2 per cent in September, well below the Bank of England's target of 2 per cent, and the lowest since September 2009.

Low inflation removes any immediate pressure on the Bank to raise interest rates amid the continuing uncertain recovery in the wider economy.

The Office for National Statistics said the fall from 1.5 per cent in August had been sharper than expected.

For the fifth month in a row food bills fell, down by 1.4 per cent year-on-year, the steepest drop since June 2002.

The coalition's triple lock in pensions means the state pension will still rise by 2.5 per cent. 

Mr Osborne said: 'We have a double-dose of good economic news for families and for pensioners. The increase in prices is much lower than expected. And that helps families. 

'And the pension next year will go up by more than double the rate of inflation thanks to the Government's triple-lock. 

'So it's an example today of how the long-term economic plan is not just working, but working for you.'

Today's figures reveals the longest sustained period of flat or falling food prices since the end of 2004.

Low inflation is good news for millions of families who have been struggling to cope with rising bills.

Latest figures show that average wages are rising by 0.7 per cent year-on-year, so even with 1.2 per cent inflation incomes are being outstripped by rising prices.

Prime Minister David Cameron said: 'It's good news that inflation remains low. Our long-term economic plan is delivering more financial security and stability for families.

'Today's inflation figures mean a big real-terms increase in the state pension next year - helping people who've worked hard all their lives.'

The Bank of England targets inflation at 2 per cent but it has now been below this level for nine months in a row.

With inflation falling, the Bank will be reluctant to put up interest rates amid fears it could stifle the recovery. 

New figures from the Office for National Statistics show the CPI rate of inflation has fallen to just 1.2 per cent

Cheaper transport and computer prices and lower bills in restaurants were the biggest factors for the lower rate of inflation, the ONS said

Britain's house price boom is showing no sign of slowing – after fresh figures released today revealed the cost of buying a house has increased 11.7 per cent over the past year.

The average cost of a house in the UK hit a new high of £274,000 in August, as increases in London and the South East fuelled a nationwide jump in prices.

In the capital property prices jumped by 19.6 per cent – with the average home now worth £514,000.

The increasing cost of housing is making it increasingly difficult for first-time buyers to get their foot on the ladder.

In August, prices paid by first-time buyers were 12.9 per cent higher on average than the same time last year.

The average price for properties bought by first-time buyers increased was £210,000.

England continued to see the largest house price growth across the UK – with properties going up in value by 12.2 per cent in the year to August.

The cost of buying a home in Wales was up 4.7 per cent, while in Scotland prices jumped 6.7 per cent. Northern Ireland also enjoyed strong house price growth – with property values up 9.6 per cent over the year.

Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said: 'With oil and petrol prices falling, import costs dropping due to the exchange rate, supermarkets engulfed in price wars and wage growth at a record low, it's hard to see why inflation should do anything other than fall further in coming months,.

'This more benign inflation outlook should certainly take pressure off the Bank of England to raise rates, and could even add to calls for policy-makers to do more to shore up the recovery amid signs that growth could fade in coming months.

'While a few months ago, the likelihood was growing that the Bank might need to hike interest rates in late 2014 or early next year, the data are now stacking up to suggest a hike could be delayed at least until next summer, after the general election.'

ING Bank economist James Knightley said: 'With inflation substantially below the Bank of England's 2 per cent target and the eurozone growth outlook appearing to deteriorate, there is little pressure to tighten monetary policy any time soon.

'This means our February prediction for the first rate hike may be a little early.'

Howard Archer, of IHS Global Insight, said: 'We have long been expecting the Bank of England to first raise interest rates from 0.50 per cent to 0.75 per cent in February - but it is looking ever more likely that the Bank will delay acting until nearer mid-year.'

The pound fell sharply today as the sharper-than expected inflation drop meant it was less likely that the Bank of England will need to take action soon to raise interest rates from their five-year low of 0.5 per cent.

The ONS said there were three key factors in the fall in inflation: transport, recreation and culture, and restaurants and hotels.

The cost of transport fell by 2.4 per cent between August and September, especially for air and sea fares, as travel firms cut costs after the summer holidays.

Under recreation and culture, prices fell by 0.1 per cent. The ONS said: 'Much of the downward contribution came from price movements for technological goods such as laptop and tablet computers, computer accessories (eg printers and routers), games consoles and computer games.

'Prices for hardback books and ebooks also contributed to the slowdown in the rate of inflation.'

Prices in restaurants and hotels rose at a slower rate between August and September, with the downward contribution coming from price movements in restaurants, cafes and canteens.

The figures also showed that petrol fell by 0.8p per litre in September compared with the previous month, and diesel by 0.7p, amid tumbling oil prices.

The CPI figure means that state pensions will rise by 2.5 per cent or £2.85 a week next spring as the Government's 'triple lock' ensures an increase of whichever is the greater out of average earnings, September's inflation rate or 2.5 per cent.

Lib Dem Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander said: 'This below target inflation number is good news for everyone, but will help pensioners in particular as the Liberal Democrat flagship 'Triple Lock' policy will kick in to give an above inflation pension increase. 

'The Triple Lock delivers a pension rise of whichever is the greater of average earnings, inflation or 2.5 per cent. 

'This means that next year the basic state pension will rise by 2.5 per cent or £2.85 a week. With Liberal Democrats in Government the basic state pension has risen by over £950.'

Labour's shadow treasury minister Catherine McKinnell said: 'The squeeze on working people continues despite this fall in the rate of inflation. 

'Total pay is rising at just 0.6 per cent, which is half the rate of CPI inflation announced today.'
