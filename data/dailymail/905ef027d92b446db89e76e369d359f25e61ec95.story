Jailed: Rawad Bastawi was sentenced to eight years in prison for rape and sexually assault

A man who raped and sexually assaulted a 13-year-girl after plying her with drugs and alcohol has been jailed for eight years.

Rawad Bastawi was found guilty of abusing the underage teen over a number of days at an address in Whitehawk, Brighton.

The 31-year-old maintained his innocence throughout the two-week trial but was found guilty by a jury and sentenced today at   Lewes Crown Court.

Bastawi, who has no fixed address, was arrested in January this year and charged with rape and sexual activity with the 13-year-old girl.

He was also accused of the rape of a 15-year-old girl and sexual assaults against a 16-year-old girl but was found not guilty of the crimes.

Detective Constable Ed Downes, who led the investigation, said: ‘Bastawi is a despicable individual who abused the trust of the victim over a number of days by plying them with alcohol and cannabis.'

He said that by pleading not guilty Bastawi had put his victim through the ordeal of having to give evidence and relive the abuse she suffered at his hands.

‘Today’s verdict and sentence brings a 
successful resolution to what has been a long ordeal for the families 
involved,' he added.

Bastawi was sentenced at Lewes Crown & County Court in East Sussex earlier today

'The sentence imposed sends a clear message that offences of this nature will be harshly dealt with if found guilty.’

Bastawi was ordered to sign the sex offenders register and has also been served with a Sexual Offences Prevention Order restricting his contact with teenage girls.

Mr Downes said: ‘I would appeal to anyone who is a victim of sexual crime or knows of someone who they think is being abused to please contact us.

‘Your call will be dealt with in the strictest of confidentiality and we will work with our partner agencies to provide you with the right support and care.’
