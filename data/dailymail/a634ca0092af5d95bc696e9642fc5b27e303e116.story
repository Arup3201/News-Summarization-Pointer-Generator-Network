A Labour council forced residents to sit through a 45-second anti-cuts message every time they rang their town hall.

Derby City Council was accused of holding callers ‘hostage’ by ‘force feeding’ them with taxpayer-funded propaganda about government cuts.

The monologue tells people who ring its switchboard about savings targets before they are given menu options.

Everyone who phoned Derby town hall, which charges callers the local rate, was forced to listen to a 45 second message before being given menu options

It begins: ‘Due to the cuts in government funding and the rising costs of providing services, our council has to save another £60million over the next three years.’

The message then asks residents to give their views about which services should be cut, and which should be saved.

The council’s number is not a freephone one, meaning callers have to pay the normal local rate charge to hear the message.

Last night Bob Neill, a Conservative Party vice chairman, said: ‘This is a new low for Labour – ramming anti-Government propaganda down the throats of people while they’re held hostage on the phone.

Due to the cuts in government funding and the rising costs of providing services, our council has to save another £60million over the next three years. 

This means we will not be able to provide all of the services we currently do.

Through Derby’s Big Conversation you can influence the decisions we make about the future of council services by telling us which services are important to you, your family and your community.

You can get involved by giving us your views by using our online budget simulator.

‘It’s a disgraceful misuse of hardworking taxpayers’ money, and is particularly audacious at a time when Labour leader Ed Miliband refuses to talk about the deficit and has no long-term economic plan for the country.

‘The truth is, Labour’s policies that got us into a financial mess in the first place, and under their watch British people and their families would be much less secure.’ 

Derby’s anti-cuts message was broadcast to anyone who rang up the council with a query or complaint about a service. Following complaints, an option to skip it was installed on Monday night.

The council is expecting to shed another 350 posts on top of the 1,200 lost since 2010. Band D council taxpayers in Derby pay £1,404.50 a year – slightly below the national average of £1,456.

Matthew Holmes, the council’s deputy Conservative leader, said: ‘I very much doubt that residents calling the council to have something important dealt with or to ask for advice will be happy to be force fed an anti-government message, nor be pleased at the delay in being able to speak to an adviser.

‘It’s completely the wrong way to deal with customers who are likely to be quite angry when they are eventually put through to a member of staff due to the message.

‘The customer is also paying for the phone call, which is being artificially extended with what a majority see as propaganda.’

Last year another Labour council, Lambeth in south London, was accused of using taxpayers’ money to fund anti-government posters complaining about the effect of cuts. 

One of the 50 posters even warned benefits claimants that cuts mean they ‘may have to find work’.

Derby Council (town hall pictured) refused to apologise for the message, which was branded 'propaganda' by critics, saying the information was factually accurate

In Derby, Labour refused to apologise for its message. Martin Rawson, deputy leader of the council, said the recording was ‘a statement of fact’.

‘It was a collective decision by the [Labour] leadership to put the message on there because we feel it is important for the people of Derby to tell us what… they think about the cuts,’ he told the BBC.

‘The council is facing unprecedented cuts to its budget both now and in the future, which is why we’re inviting everyone to take part in the Big Conversation – to give Derby people a say on how we balance the budget.

‘A message was added for incoming callers to the council to maximise our engagement through the Big Conversation.

‘By using as many channels as we have available, such as phone messages, our website, e-shots and social media, it enables as many people as possible to tell us their thoughts.

‘Ultimately, this is about driving people to the [online] budget simulator and encouraging them to share their views to enable decisions to be based on the feedback of the public.’
