A former NBC employee who says he used to keep guard outside Bill Cosby's door after teenage models were taken to his dressing room has spoken out about his shame.

Frank Scotti, who has also claimed that he funneled thousands of dollars to women the star favored, said some of the visitors were as young as 16.

'I felt like a pimp,' Scotti, now 90, told the Today show on Monday. 'I felt dirty.'

He said he decided to come forward now after 18 women stepped forward to accuse Cosby of inappropriate behavior - from unwelcome advances to drugging and rape.

Scotti said he feels sorry for the women.

'I just felt he's not the person I thought he was,' he said.

Scotti first spoke to the New York Daily News about his relationship to the comedian, claiming he spent years as NBC's 'fixer' for Cosby, funneling thousands of dollars to his virtual harem of women as The Cosby Show was being filmed.

'He had everybody fooled,' said Scotti. 

He eventually walked away from the star because of how he treated women, he said.

The NBC veteran said Cosby had a rotating lineup of young women brought to his Brooklyn dressing room by a complicit modeling agency in Manhattan.

Scotti said the Manhattan agency's owner would lead the girls there and leave once Cosby picked his chosen lady.

'She knew exactly what was going to go on,' Scotti told the News. 'Then he'd tell me, "Stand outside the door and don't let anyone in." Now you put that together and figure (out) why.'

According to Scotti, some of the girls were as young as 16.

Scotti claims Cosby would put women he especially liked up in apartments and give them up to $2,000 per month.

After decades, Scotti has even saved receipts from money orders he says he gave those women for Cosby.

One of those women, Shawn Thompson, had a daughter named Autumn Jackson who would claim Cosby was her father.

The money orders, though, are in Scotti's name and not Cosby's.

'I did a lot of crazy things for him,' Scotti told the Daily News. 'He was covering himself by having my name on it. It was a coverup. I realized it later.'

And when he did, Scotti said he had to walk away.

'You've got all of these kids, every time,' he told the Daily News. 'I used to like him, but that's the reason I quit him after so many years — because of the girls.'

In recent weeks, at least seven women have publicly accused the 77-year-old Cosby of sexual assault years ago.

Cosby has not been charged in connection with any of the allegations. Only one woman has filed suit - Andrea Constand, who sued in 2005 and settled for an undisclosed amount before the case went to trial.

Cosby's attorney, Martin Singer, has criticized previous 'decades-old discredited allegations' and denied some others. He suggested in a Friday statement that Cosby's accusers may have another agenda.

'There has never been a shortage of lawyers willing to represent people with claims against rich, powerful men, so it makes no sense that not one of these new women who just came forward for the first time now ever asserted a legal claim back at the time they allege they had been sexually assaulted.' 

A statement issued Friday by Bill Cosby's lawyer, Martin Singer, in response to allegations of sexual assault against the comic:

'The new, never-before-heard claims from women who have come forward in the past two weeks with unsubstantiated, fantastical stories about things they say occurred 30, 40, or even 50 years ago have escalated far past the point of absurdity.

These brand new claims about alleged decades-old events are becoming increasingly ridiculous, and it is completely illogical that so many people would have said nothing, done nothing, and made no reports to law enforcement or asserted civil claims if they thought they had been assaulted over a span of so many years.

Lawsuits are filed against people in the public eye every day. There has never been a shortage of lawyers willing to represent people with claims against rich, powerful men, so it makes no sense that not one of these new women who just came forward for the first time now ever asserted a legal claim back at the time they allege they had been sexually assaulted.

This situation is an unprecedented example of the media's breakneck rush to run stories without any corroboration or adherence to traditional journalistic standards. Over and over again, we have refuted these new unsubstantiated stories with documentary evidence, only to have a new uncorroborated story crop up out of the woodwork. When will it end?

It is long past time for this media vilification of Mr. Cosby to stop.'
