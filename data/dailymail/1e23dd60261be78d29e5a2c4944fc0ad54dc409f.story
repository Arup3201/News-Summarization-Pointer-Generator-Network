At best, theirs is a fractious relationship.

But it seems that the two Koreas have been united by one thing - a love of chocolate.

For a marshmallow chocolate pie has become so popular in North Korea that people are buying it for up to a day's pay on the black market after it has been smuggled out of the South.

The average North Korean reportedly makes the equivalent of between $100 (£60) to $200 (£120) a month.

But they are paying up to $10 (£6) for South Korea's Choco-Pies - a Wagon Wheel type biscuit containing two disc-shaped, chocolate-covered cakes, filled with marshmallow cream. 

In South Korea, where the treats are manufactured, they cost less than 50 cents, CNN reports.

It is believed the North was first introduced to the confectionery via the Kaesong Industrial Complex - where 100 South Korean factory owners employ about 50,000 North Korean labourers.

The North Korean workers were given soup and snacks to sustain them throughout the day - and received the Choco-Pies in their lunchboxes.

The South Korean companies were also banned from paying their North Korean employees cash bonuses and instead rewarded them with food products, including the chocolate biscuits.

It soon became obvious to factory owners that the workers were not all eating the treats at work, and many had taken them home to their families.

A South Korean factory owner, who gave his North Korean workers Choco Pies, along with Coca Cola, said his workers were 'ecstatic at the taste'.

He told CNN: 'It was clear that the workers had gotten at least some idea of capitalism and that it wasn't all bad.'

In North Korea, the black market for capitalist products is highly illegal, but thriving.

North Korea suffered a crippling famine in the 1990s that killed an estimated one million people, and it has struggled with food production since.

Previously, food such as pizzas, hamburgers and french fries were banned from the North.

Choco-Pies have even been sent to North Korea in balloons by advocacy groups.

Last year it was reported that many workers sold the Choco-Pies on the black market as a means of supplementing their income.

When Pyongyang closed the Kaesong Industrial Complex, amid heightened tensions in the region, black market values of the Choco-Pies soared, with some changing hands for up to $23 or £14.

It is believed the price has soared once again thanks to the decision by some factory owners to change lunchbox snacks from Choco-Pies, to noodles.
