Francois Hollande has been pictured for the first time with his ‘secret’ lover Julie Gayet – relaxing in the official home of the French president. 

According to French sources Gayet has been a regular fixture at the Elysee Palace for months. 

The images of the pair sitting in the gardens of the Elysee Palace come as former first lady Valerie Trierweiler prepares to arrives in Britain. 

She was unceremoniously dumped by Mr Hollande in January, but is now promoting a kiss-and-tell book subtitled: ‘A story of love, power and betrayal’.

Caught in the act: The pictures, published by a French magazine, shows Francois Hollande and his rumoured girlfriend Julie Gayet, 42, sitting in the gardens of the Elysee Palace in Paris

It describes how Mr Hollande, 60, carried out a secret affair with Ms Gayet, a 42-year-old TV actress, behind her back.

The head of state was infamously pictured coming out of their love nest, just around the corner from the Elysee, trying to use a crash helmet to hide his identity.

But today Voici magazine shows Mr Hollande and Ms Gayet together for the first time in a spread entitled ‘Pictures of a couple in love’. 

They show Mr Hollande wearing a suit and tie, as he leans towards his girlfriend, while she looks lovingly into his eyes.

There was speculation in Paris today that Mr Hollande may have allowed the blurred pictures to appear as a message to Ms Trierweiler, 49, who has been hugely vitriolic towards him.

There was speculation in Paris today that Mr Hollande may have allowed the blurred pictures to appear as a message to Ms Trierweiler, 49, who has been hugely vitriolic towards him

She is expected to pour further humiliation on the man she portrays as a liar and a cheat while appearing on flagship BBC programmes including the Andrew Marr show and Newsnight. 

Asked about his affair on French TV earlier this month, Mr Hollande replied: ‘If I made mistakes, I recognise them. There are pains, and I forgive them.’ 

But his ambiguous – not to say confusing – reply did not mention well sourced claims that Ms Gayet is actually staying overnight at the presidential palace, and there are even claims that she has her own bodyguard. 

Many have complained that taxpayers' money is being used to fund the president's relationship with Ms Gayet, but this has not stopped her issuing privacy complaints through the French courts.

The latest photographs were taken in October, when Ms Gayet is said to have tried to throw photographers off the scent by having a driver approach from different routes. She is said to always enter the Elysee Palace via a stately back gate.

Asked whether his secret trysts with Ms Gayet had debased the institution of the presidency, Mr Hollande said in the TV interview: ‘I think the responsibility is collective. I don’t want to shirk my responsibilities but there comes a time when one must respect private life.’

 The President, who has four grown up children with his ecology minister, Segolene Royal, is officially single, and his press office would not comment on the Voice photos. 

The latest opinion polls show Mr Hollande’s popularity at a record low of 12 per cent, and his hopes of re-election in 2017 already look extremely thin.
