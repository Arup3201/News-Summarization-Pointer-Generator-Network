A mother-of-three humiliated when she was told she was too large for a rollercoaster has gone on to lose more than 8st.

Amy Beveridge, 31, was asked to step off the ride after staff at a Yorkshire theme park were unable to fasten her safety belt. Amy had to do what she describes as the 'walk of shame' past all of the customers sitting in the rollercoaster ready to ride.

Mortified, she decided to turn her life around. She banned processed foods, joined a slimming club and began regular exercise to slim down from 17st 6lb to the 9st 2lb she is today.

At her largest she wore size 24 clothing - today she can fit into a stylish size eight.

She said the turning point was a mortifying experience on the Eagle’s Claw ride at the Lightwater Valley theme park in North Yorkshire.

She said: 'After I took my seat on the ride an attendant came over to click everyone’s safety bars into place. When he got to me, he couldn’t get the bar to close - it wouldn’t fit over me because I was too big.

'The ride was full of people at the time and I had to get off and take a walk of shame back to the queue.

'It was mortifying. I knew there and then I had to make some big changes.'

Mrs Beveridge, of Edinburgh, said her struggle with weight began while she was pregnant with her first child Callum, now aged nine, and got worse while she was carrying her second son, Euan, now seven.

She said: 'With Callum, but even more so with Euan, I found it very difficult to keep food down while I was pregnant. I was sick very easily.

'I couldn’t hold down fresh meat, so instead I relied on processed foods which I thought would be safer. When I found I could keep something down, I just kept eating it.

'Unfortunately, that meant I ate a lot of pre-packaged cheesy pasta. I could eat a whole box of it without even noticing. On top of that I ate crisps, sweets and chocolates during the day.'

Following her excruciating experience at Lightwater Valley in August 2009 Mrs Beveridge, a project worker for children’s charity Bernardo’s, was supported in her determination to change her lifestyle by her husband Douglas, 39, who serves in the British Army.

She said: 'The very next day I joined a slimming club. It was the first time I’d been weighed since I was 16 year old - it was a bit of shock to be told I’d reached 17st 6lb. I hadn’t realised quite how overweight I’d become.

'I went home that night and threw out all the processed foods. I still made the boys their healthy square meals, but when making my own food I was sure to follow the healthy eating plan which had been set by the slimming club.

'I began buying fresh ingredients and learned to cook healthy things for the family. If I made a spaghetti bolognese I made it from scratch rather than just getting sauce from a jar. I came to enjoy cooking - it was something I could do with my boys too.'

She also committed to exercising up to five times a week, including swimming, which she continued until only a few days before she gave birth to the couple’s youngest son Ross, now two.

Today she exercises at her local gym, undertaking a mixture of cardio and weight training.

Amy joined a slimming club and threw out process foods, instead cooking healthy meals from scratch and also committed to exercising 5 times a week, resulting in her losing an incredible 8 stone

But the dramatic weight loss came with a price as she struggled with more than 5lb of excess skin.

She said: 'It was really hard. At the gym I was always very conscious that my skin was wobbling around. I tried to wear clothes that were one size too small to stop my skin moving around too much. It was very uncomfortable.'

In July 2013, Mrs Beveridge underwent an NHS-funded operation to remove the excess skin.

She said: 'The surgeon removed 5.5lb of skin. Once it had gone, I felt as if I had reached an amazing goal. I feel absolutely amazing.

'I’m so much happier and more confident now. I know Douglas is very proud of me and happy with the way I look.

'It’s made such a difference to my life and I really feel as if all my efforts have been worth it. I’m completely over the moon with how far I’ve come.'
