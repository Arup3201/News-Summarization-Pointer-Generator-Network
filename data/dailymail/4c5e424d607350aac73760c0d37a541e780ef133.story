A retired Canadian Mountie admitted in court Thursday to killing his wife over a Ninetendo Wii game bet.

Keith Wiens, who has been charged with second degree murder in the 2011 killing of his common law wife Lynn Kalmring, said in court in British Columbia that he only killed her because he feared for his life.

On August 11, 2011 - the night that Kalmring died - the two had played a Ninetendo Wii video game after drinking alcohol and eating dinner.

Wiens said they usually waged bets of a sexual nature, and that Kalmring had won the game that night.

Later, when he went to bed, Wiens found sex toys scattered across his pillow.

Wiens, who wanted to get rest before a golf game the next day, pushed the toys aside and tried to go to sleep.

That's when Kalmring became upset.

Wiens said that she confronted him multiple times and then suggested that he didn't want to have sex because he wasn't attracted to her and that he wanted to go to work in Grand Prairie to get out of their relationship.

'I said "No, it's nothing to do with that. I love you. I just need to get some sleep,"' Wiens said.

He went back to rest, but Kalmring wouldn't give up. He told her to go sleep in the spare room and thought that worked until he was woken up later by Kalmring hitting him.

Something had changed, Wiens noticed. And he began to fear for his life.

'She was not Lynn. She was crazy and she'd just assaulted me when I was sound asleep, and I was worried about what was coming next,' he recalled.

So he pulled out the handgun he kept in his bedside table for protection.

When Kalmring burst through the bedroom again, this time with a knife, Wiens shot her once in the head.

He then says that he put his gun back in his holster and went to throw up in the bathroom. He called 911, got dressed and waited for police outside.

According to Wiens, this was the first fight that the couple ever had.

But the prosecution and experts found faults in Wiens testimony.

First of all, it wasn't the first fight.

Crown counselor Colin Forsyth pointed out that they had been in an argument before when Wiens stopped Kalmring from breaking into Willie Nelson's dressing room at a concert and flashing her breasts.

'That's the only time we had a disagreement with each other,' Wiens said.

A forensic pathologist also found it strange that Kalmring was found with the knife in her hand.

If she was shot she would have dropped the knife, or if she grasped it as she fell to the floor, it wouldn't have been easy to pry from her hands.

'I didn't touch Lynn in anyway, shape or form,' Wiens responded.

The trial continues Monday.Â

An expert testified that Kalmring would not have been found with a knife in her hand, or - if she had - it would have been difficult to pry away
