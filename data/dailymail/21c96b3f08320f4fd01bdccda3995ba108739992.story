Jeremy Hunt described Ukip as unpatriotic

A Tory Cabinet minister yesterday made an outspoken attack on Ukip, describing it as an unpatriotic party which attracts racists.

Jeremy Hunt also accused Nigel Farage’s party of being divisive.

The Health Secretary’s attack was sparked by what he described as the ‘absolutely disgusting’ comments made by one of the party’s council candidates, who said comedian Lenny Henry should emigrate to a ‘black country’.

The remarks by Mr Hunt, one of David Cameron’s closest colleagues, echo the Prime Minister’s famous description of Ukip as a bunch of ‘fruitcakes, loonies and closet racists’.

Mr Hunt’s attack was also a sign that the political establishment is becoming rattled by Ukip’s success and that the Tories are worried about a bloodbath at the European elections on May 22.

It followed the release of a poll which put Ukip in the lead for the first time in the European elections battle.

The Eurosceptic party was at 31 per cent in the YouGov poll for The Sunday Times. This was three percentage points higher than Labour and well ahead of the Tories on 19 per cent and the Liberal Democrats on 9 per cent.

It indicates that Ukip’s fortunes have not been hampered by its week of gaffes.

Last week, builder Andre Lampitt, who starred in a party broadcast, was suspended after tweeting criticism of Islam and Nigerians.

It also emerged that a ‘British builder’ featuring in an election poster about cheap foreign labour was actually an Irish actor.

And an ordinary voter featured in the Ukip manifesto turned out to be party worker Lizzy Vaid.

At the weekend, Lib Dem peer Lord Oakeshott accused Ukip of being the ‘BNP in blazers’ – after an analysis of Ukip’s political posters showed startling similarities withadverts put out by the far-Right BNP. It also emerged that William Henwood, who is standing for Ukip in Enfield, north London, had sent a tweet about Lenny Henry saying: ‘He should emigrate to a black country. He does not have to live with whites.’

His comments came after Henry said there should be more people from ethnic minorities on TV.

Yesterday, Mr Hunt told BBC Radio Five Live: ‘I do think those comments about Lenny Henry were absolutely disgusting and I do think it’s for Nigel Farage to make absolutely clear that that isn’t Ukip’s official view, but also to explain why so many people with those kinds of views seem to be attracted to becoming candidates for Ukip.’

Asked whether the tweet was racist, he said: ‘I think it is, and that’s why I would like to hear a very clear denunciation of that from Nigel Farage. I think it is totally unacceptable and [Lenny Henry] is as British as you or I are.’ 

Jeremy Hunt has called on Nigel Farage to denouce Mr Henwood's comments and make it clear that they will not be tolerated

He added: ‘I think there’s a broader risk for Ukip here, because they position themselves as a patriotic party, they plaster the Union Jack all over their leaflets, but actually I think there is something very un-British about this kind of language, very unpleasant.

‘We are not a divisive country, we want to be a country where we avoid that kind of rhetoric, and I think that’s where there are some real dangers for Ukip.’

Mr Cameron made his ‘closet racist’ comments in 2006 – but since then the Conservatives have been wary of making personal attacks on the Eurosceptic party.

Ukip’s deputy chairman, former Tory MP Neil Hamilton, said Mr Henwood’s comments were being investigated by the party.

He claimed that ‘every party’ had ‘unknown’ activists who ‘may have said something unpleasant on social media’.

Mr Hamilton told the BBC that the party was attracting ‘decent’ former supporters of the BNP who feel ‘swamped’ by immigrants.

Would-be Ukip councillor  William Henwood said Lenny Henry should emigrate to a ‘black country’ after the  comedian said there should be more ethnic minorities in  creative industries.

Defending his Twitter remark, the Ukip candidate later told the BBC: ‘I think if black people come to this country and don’t like mixing with white people why are they here?

‘If he (Henry) wants a lot of blacks around go and live in a black country.’

In previous tweets Mr Henwood, 66, has compared Islam to the Nazi Third Reich. He wrote: ‘Islam reminds me of the 3rd Reich. Strength through violence against the citizens.’

Mr Henry, 55, is the son of Jamaican immigrants and was born and raised in Dudley, West Midlands. He shot to fame as a comedian and has recently  performed to great critical acclaim in Shakespeare.

Earlier this month he said that he wanted the public to join his campaign to put more ethnic minorities on the screen. Ukip has already launched an investigation into another of its aspiring politicians after apparently homophobic and racist comments came to light.

On March 29, the day gay marriage was made legal in the UK, Robert Bilcliff, who is standing to be a councillor in Tamworth, Staffordshire, wrote on Twitter: ‘Sad day for all us straight people.’In a separate Facebook post in July 2012 he allegedly made a joke against Muslims.
