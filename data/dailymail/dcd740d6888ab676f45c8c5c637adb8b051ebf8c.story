Britain’s first mobile ‘drunk tank’ has been launched to treat intoxicated revellers at Christmas - and help ease the strain on the NHS and police.

The Alcohol Recovery Centre (ARC) is a state-of-the-art medical facility to take care of drunkards instead of them being sent to A&E or police cells.

Ten of the 65ft vehicles will be rolled out across the country at no cost to the taxpayer, and the first of them was unveiled in Bristol yesterday.

The £5.5million scheme has been funded by a grant from the National Licensed Trade Association (NTLA), and an initiative called Barcode.

Tomorrow, the first of the 10 ARCs will be launched in Bristol city centre in time for the last Friday before Christmas.

The ARC can treat 11 people with eight beds, three ‘restraint’ bucket seats with straps and two showers.

It comes with medical drips, oxygen, blood testing equipment that can send results to hospitals, a sluice room and pump system for the worst patients.

It is part of a multi-partnership between Avon and Somerset police, South West Ambulance Service, Bristol City Council, NHS Bristol CCC, NLTA, and University Hospitals Bristol NHS Trust. 

Andy Bishop, managing director of the NLTA, said: 'I am delighted to be involved with this pioneering national scheme that will have a profound effect on the licensed trade and in turn reduce the pressure of anti-social drinking on the emergency service.

'Although we look forward to seeing the success of the project across the UK, our aim is that, through education, there will be no need for such assistance in our society.'

Vicky Titterton, an operations officer for South West Ambulance Service, said: ‘It’s brilliant. 

'Obviously lots of companies will have Christmas parties. People shouldn’t be getting into this state though. Everyone is entitled to have fun but everyone has to be aware of their safety.’

The self-sustaining lorry will be rolled out on December 18, 19, 20, 27 and 31, before returning to the East Midlands for upgrades in January.
