A social network for sex toys has been revealed that aims to allows users to meet and interact with each other easily has been launched.

Called FriXion, the firm says it will allow people to easily and remotely control a range of sex toys from differentmanufacturers easily.

It even hopes to develop games and live broadcasts using the technology, where one performer can control thousands of devices around the globe.

The firm  is adapting this $199 computer game controller to work with sex toys as part of the project to link couples remotely.

The Florida -based cyberdildonics company FriXion is currently beta-testing the system.

'Frixion is a software company, we want to take off the shelf products and work with them, the firm's founder Seth, who would not reveal his last name, told dailymail.com .

'We are working with robotic devices that we are adapting for this.'

The firm is initially adapting a $199 game controller with a built in vibration function.

'We met the guys who invented this, and it fitted perfectly. 

'Eventually we will sell out own devices - we have some great ideas.' 

'We are an ambitious startup with the goal of getting people interacting physically on the internet,' it says.

'With this in mind, our beta explores ways that intimacy can be augmented by technology. 

'Using sophisticated haptic teledildonics two or more FriXion users are able to touch each other and even have sex at any distance.' 

The network uses off-the-shelf sex toys and already existing technologies and connects them using its network.

It allows teledildonic devices — dildos, vibrators, and sleeves, for example— to interact with each other using real-time bidirectional force feedback.

Called FriXion, the firm says it will allow people to easily and remotely control a range of sex aids from different manufacturers easily.

'On the next generation haptic social network innovative and affordable haptic peripherals empower FriXion users to come together and touch each other in tangible, stimulating ways; from holding hands and kissing up to and including full penetrative sex whether your partner is across the room or across an ocean,' the firm says.

Founder Seth, says the effect is extremely realistic.

'Frixion is a software platform we're developing to enable people to connect physically over distance,' he told Nerve.

'It feels like the act of sex. While you're thrusting, I'm being penetrated. You're pushing back. I'm feeling the resistance.'

Elsewhere, people who want to hold hands with someone miles away can buy a pair of Freebles.

When one user squeezes their Frebble (pictured), the corresponding Frebble in their loved one's hand will gently apply pressure to the back of their hand, simulating what they would feel if you were holding hands right next to each other.

When one user squeezes their Frebble, the corresponding Frebble in their loved one's hand will gently apply pressure to the back of their hand, simulating what they would feel if you were holding hands right next to each other. 

When combined with Skype, for example, the experience is said to be 'immersive'.

Frebble uses haptic technology, or 'tactile feedback' to mimic the sensation of hand-holding through two devices.

Once the Frebbles have connected to each other through the internet, when one user squeezes their device, the other user will feel the sensation of their hand being held.

They do this thanks to two pressure sensors at the front of each device to register squeezing, two vibration motors on the side to make the sensation feel more real, and one integrated 'squeeze bar' to replicate holding hands.

A multicolour LED will indicate connection status and when a squeeze is waiting. 

'For a granddaughter calling grandma with special news, for a husband far away from a wife, for distant grown daughters who crave the comfort of their mother's touch, for a best friend who wants to let her friend know it will all be ok, Frebble connects – as simply, subtly and as powerfully as though the person was right there with you,' the company says.

'While there are many ways to see and hear your loved ones through the power of the internet, the tactile element has been missing – until now. With Frebble, you can cut through the distance and share that smallest gesture – the squeeze of the hand – that means so much.'
