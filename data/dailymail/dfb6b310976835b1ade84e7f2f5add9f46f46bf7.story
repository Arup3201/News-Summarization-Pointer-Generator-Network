An inquiry into Ched Evans' rape conviction is underway as the former Premier League striker is keen on clearing his name after serving half of his five-year sentence.

Evans was sentenced to five years in prison after he was found guilty of raping a 19-year-old woman in April 2012.

The incident occurred at a Premier Inn near Rhyl, Denbighshire in May 2011. 

Ched Evans was pictured at a petrol garage in Wimslow, Cheshire earlier this week

Evans, now 25, has maintained his innocence despite being found guilty.

The Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) said in October that they would fast-track its inquiry into Evans' sentence, however it could still take 35 weeks for the independent public body to make a decision.

A CCRC spokesman said: 'The case has not been prioritised because Mr Evans is relatively famous, because he plays football for a living, or for any reason external to the specific facts of the case.

'Prioritisation like this is not typical but it is by no means unprecedented.

'We prioritise applications where there is need and where it accords with our policy to do so, we expect to prioritise perhaps one or two such cases each month.'

Evans has been unable to find a new club since his release from prison in October.
