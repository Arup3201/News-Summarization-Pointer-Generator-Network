Sydney has become one of the world's growing  hotspots for ultra-millionaires, outranking the likes of Moscow and Los Angeles, a new report has revealed.

Sydney has claimed the 14th spot in a survey of 40 of the most important cities in the world for the wealthy by Knight Frank. 

Ultra High Net Worth Individuals (UHNWIs) must have a net worth of more than $30 million to qualify for membership of the exclusive rich-list.

According to a list of Australia's wealthiest people by BRW, Gina Rinehart, James Packer, Frank Lowy, Harry Triguboff and Anthony Pratt are among some of the country's richest citizens.

Rinehart has an estimated wealth of $20bn, Pratt and family's wealth is estimated at $7bn as is Packer's and Lowy's. Triguboff is thought to have a fortune of over $5bn. 

Sydney is home to most of Australia's wealth with 764 UHNWIs, followed by Melbourne at 456, Perth at 267, Brisbane at 249 while Auckland  sits at 557.

The Knight Frank Wealth Report's annual Attitudes Survey found London remains the single biggest centre for global UHNWIs, followed by Tokyo, Singapore and New York.

Still, Knight Frank's head of research and consulting, Matt Whitby, said that over the past 10 years, Australia has grabbed fourth spot in terms of countries with the greatest foreign inflows of High Net Worth Individuals (HNWIs).

'Of these HNWIs, there were 1,734 UHNWIs living in Australia in 2014, that is, someone with a net worth of over US$30 million. Sydney currently accommodates almost half of these individuals, with the capital cities of Melbourne (26%), Perth (15%) and Brisbane (14%) taking up the balance.

The report's Global Cities Survey expanded to 40 cities for the first time, collecting data from 108 major metropolitan centres to rank the UHNWI population numbers.

Sydney has the highest concentration of UHNWIs, and high-profile Australians have maintained their properties across the state.

Billionaire Gina Rinehart, from Perth, recently listed her extravagant property in the exclusive Sydney suburb of Mosman.

Rinehart's daughter Hope Welker and her husband Ryan previously lived in the stunning harbourside home before moving to New York in 2011.

Billionaire casino mogul James Packer recently revealed his new dream to build the world's finest luxury six-star hotel Barangaroo in Sydney.

Football Federation Australia (FFA) chairman Frank Lowy is reportedly living in one of Sydney's affluent suburbs of Point Piper with his family.

The Wealth Report's annual Attitudes Survey studied cities where the wealthy congregate, work, invest, educated and spend their leisure time.

'One of the clear trends to emerge from the Global Capital Markets Survey results is the increasingly global nature of private investments,' the report said.

'UHNWIs still hold most of their property investments in their own country, but in the vast majority of the locations surveyed, wealthy private individuals have been increasing the amount invested overseas.'
