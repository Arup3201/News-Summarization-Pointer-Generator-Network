This year's list of global billionaires has revealed that Mark Zuckerberg made the most money in the world in over the past 12 months.

Forbes reports that the Facebook founder's net worth nearly doubled, going from 2013's estimate of $15.2billion to $28.5billion as a result of the social network's increasing share price.

That still wasn't enough to earn him the top spot, however, as Microsoft founder Bill Gates came in at number one after slipping from the position four years ago.

Back at the top: Bill Gates was the 'richest man in the world' for 15 out of the past 20 years but was dethroned briefly by Mexican telecommunications magnate Carlos Slim up until now

Going up: Mark Zuckerberg's net worth nearly doubled to $28.5billion since Facebook's share price is now up 130 per cent over the past year

Sheryl Sandberg is arguably the most famous of the 34 women who are new to the list this year, and she just made the cut with $1.05billion after Facebook's share price increased dramatically.

Nigerian fashion head turned oil magnate Folorunsho Alakija who is worth $2.5billion. 

Denise Coates from the United Kingdom who made her $1.6billion in online gambling and developed the site Bet365.com.

Estee Lauder's granddaughters Aerin Lauder Zinterhofer and Jane Lauder have been added to the list.

Gates held the title of 'richest man in 
the world' for 15 out of the past 20 years, but he was succeeded- 
briefly- by Mexican telecommunications magnate Carlos Slim Helu for the 
past four years.

Gates, who now spends most of his time in
 philanthropy, earned his spot back as his net worth increased by 
$9billion to $76billion after Microsoft's stock had a promising year.

That stock jump put him ahead of Mr Slim Helu who came in at $72billion.

Zara owner Amancio Ortega held onto the third place spot for the second year in a row and was followed by investor Warren Buffett and Oracle head Larry Ellison came in fifth place. 

The rest of the top ten show the power of American family connections, as sixth and seventh place went to Charles and David Koch respectively.

Casino magnate Sheldon Adelson came in
 eighth place, followed by Walmart heirs- with Christy Walton and family
 coming in ninth and her brother-in-law Jim Walton came in 10th.

Their relatives Alice and S. Robson Walton also got their own spots on the list, meaning that the Walton family was responsible for four of the top 15 billionaires in the world.

Christy
 Walton's high placement means that she holds onto the title as the 
richest woman in the world, but that doesn't mean that there wasn't a 
great deal of change for women on the list.

Titans of tech: Google co-founders Larry Page,

and $31.8billion respectively

Jan Koum from WhatsApp, $6.8billion

Brian Acton from WhatsApp, $3billion

Evan Williams from Twitter, $3billion

Kenneth Feld of Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus, $1.8billion

Alexandre Grendene Bartelle owns the Brazilian shoe company that produces Havaianas flip flops, $1.5billion

Drew Houston, the CEO of tech company DropBox, $1.2billion

Vince McMahon from WWE, $1.2billion

Michael Kors, fashion designer, $1billion

More women than ever were included this year, with 172 female billionaires on the list of 1,645.

That jump marks a 24 per cent increase from last year, as only 138 women were on the list in 2013.

One
 of the new female faces was that of Sheryl Sandberg who is one of the 
youngest self-made billionaires with a net worth of $1.05billion.

Like Zuckerberg, she was helped dramatically by the fact that the Facebook share price is now up 130 per cent.

This year's billionaire's list, which is the 28th such issue for the financial magazine, comes on the same day as reports that Sandberg may be turning her gaze from Silicon Valley to Washington, D.C.

There is speculation that she may challenge Democratic Senator Barbara Boxer for one of California's two Senate seats.

Her sizable fortune would make the $30-$40million required to win the seat easily within her reach without raising a dime from anyone.

When MailOnline contacted Sandberg over the weekend, there was no comment. However, this morning a source close to her said that 'it is 100 per cent untrue.'

Though the new wave of wealthy 
technology leaders made their presence known on this year's list, 
neither of the Facebook faces were in the top 20 with Zuckerberg just 
narrowly missing the cut off.

Gates clearly led the way with Ellison
 not far behind, younger iterations like Google's Larry Page and Sergey 
Brin came in 17th and 19th place respectively.

They were interrupted along the way by Amazon's Jeff Bezos, who came in 18th place with $32billion.

Aside
 from Sandberg, another first time mention was given to designer Michael
 Kors, whose fortune breached the billion dollar mark after he took his 
eponymous company public in 2011.

Hard times may have knocked off a few:

Eike Batista, an oil and gas magnate from Brazil, was profiled as having $10.6billion to his name in 2013 but only $300million this year.

Ship-building magnate George Economou was listed with $1.7billion previously but took a hit due to the floundering Greek economy.

Mystery money men who couldn't be valued:

Larry Gagosian, an American art dealer, is believed to be a billionaire but the value of his collection is unknown.

Clinton confidante and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein was not included. His assets- including a $50million Upper East Side apartment and 100-acre plot in St Thomas- that could help him reach the billionaire's club.

Who didn't qualify, even though they're loaded:

Forbes explained that they do not consider 'royal family members or dictators who derive their fortunes entirely as a result of their position of power'.

Rwandan president Paul Kagame and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un are two such examples, with their murky financial dealings thought to put them above the billionaire mark.

Though he is near the bottom of the list, retail giants were represented well in the top 20.

Between Ortega, H&M's Stefan Persson, and LVMH's Bernard Arnault and the four Walton relatives, there were seven retail billionaires in the top 20.

By comparison, there were only six tech billionaires in the same subset, including Gates, Ellison and former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg.

Forbes says a record 1,645 billionaires made the list this year, with an average net worth of $4.7 billion. That's up from 1,426 billionaires last year with a net worth of $4.2 billion. Total net worth of this year's list was $6.4 trillion, up from $5.4 trillion last year.

The magazine said that 1,080 of the billionaires were self-made, 207 inherited their wealth and 352 inherited a portion but are still growing it.

Forbes said 268 billionaires were new to the list, beating out a prior high of 226 newcomers in 2008. And a record number of women made the list this year, with 172 women joining, up 25 percent from last year.

Altogether 100 people dropped out of the rankings, while 16 passed away.

The biggest loser dropped so dramatically that he is no longer a billionaire.

Eike Batista, an oil and gas magnate from Brazil, was profiled as having $10.6billion to his name in 2013 but only $300million this year so he wasn't included on the list.

The U.S. was the country with the 
greatest number of billionaires at 492, followed by China with 152 and 
Russia with 111.

Algeria, Lithuania, Tanzania and Uganda to the geographic mix.
