New York City police officers drew blood from an 84-year-old man on Sunday who was alleged to have jaywalked near a dangerous intersection in the Upper West Side.

Kang Wong, who lives in the area, was stopped by an officer for allegedly crossing against the light, just before 5 p.m.

According to one witness, several officers quickly converged on the man, who didn’t seem to understand English-language commands, after he simply tried to walk away.

‘The guy didn’t seem to speak English,’ Ian King, a 24-year-old Fordham law student, told the New York Post.

‘He [the officer] stood him up against the wall and was trying to write him a ticket. The man didn’t seem to understand, and he started walking away.’

That’s when the officer and several colleagues quickly converged on the senior citizen and left him badly beaten and bloodied.

‘The cop tried to pull him back and that’s when he [the pedestrian] began to struggle with the cop,’ said King.

‘As soon as he pushed the cop, it was like cops started running in from everywhere.’

With the man’s blood left spilled on the pavement, he was handcuffed and taken to a local hospital.

Police, who have promised to step-up enforcement, said they were looking into the arrest.

Law enforcement in the area had earlier promised to step-up enforcement of the law after three pedestrians were struck and killed 
within a two-block radius in the neighborhood in nine days.

The latest crash occurred when a 26-year-old woman, Samantha Lee, was crossing 96th street when she was clipped by the driver’s side mirror of an ambulance.

She was run over by a red, four-door Dodge Charger after ending  up face-down in the road and was pronounced dead at the scene.

Both drivers stayed at the scene and no arrests were immediately made.

A week ago on Friday, a nine-year-old boy, Cooper Stock, was struck and killed by a taxi while crossing with his father, while the same night a tour bus dragged 73-year-old Alexander Shear to his death.

‘This intersection is getting worse and worse,’ one elderly neighbor told the Post.
