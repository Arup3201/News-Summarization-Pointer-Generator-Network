Ashley Cole yesterday backed his ‘good friend’ John Terry and insisted it was wrong to prosecute him for alleged racist abuse.

Giving evidence for his England and Chelsea team-mate, the footballer told Westminster Magistrates’ Court: ‘We shouldn’t be sitting here.’

He was supported by a host of football stars, including their Chelsea team-mate Frank Lampard and former manager Jose Mourinho, who vouched that Terry was not racist.

Former England captain Terry is accused 
of calling QPR player Anton Ferdinand a ‘****ing black c***’ during a 
game after being goaded over his extra-marital affair with Vanessa 
Perroncel, the ex-girlfriend of former team-mate Wayne Bridge.

Support: Ray Wilkins told the court Terry was a peacemaker in training if players had words

But Cole told the court that he believed Terry was only repeating back the slur that Ferdinand mistakenly thought he had used.

He said that while racism should never be tolerated, saying back what you thought someone said was ‘completely different’.

Cole said he did not hear what Terry said to Ferdinand despite being 
only about a car-length away from the row at the end of a bad-tempered 
West London derby between QPR and Chelsea last October.

But he said he saw Ferdinand shouting either the word ‘black’ or 
‘Bridgey’ – an apparent reference to Wayne Bridge – and make a lewd 
gesture at Terry.

Cole said he told Ferdinand: ‘What you’re doing to JT [Terry] is out of 
order’. He added that he did not shake Ferdinand’s hand after the game.

The left-back said abuse towards Terry over his affair with Miss 
Perroncel was commonplace during games, but he had never seen him react 
to it, explaining: ‘He would probably laugh about it, it’s part and 
parcel of the game and you get used to it.’

Describing what happened after the match, when Terry invited Ferdinand 
into the Chelsea dressing room to try to put the row ‘to bed’, Cole 
said: ‘I think John said, “Did you think I called you a black c***, did 
you think I was being racist?”

Then I said, “Did you think John was 
being racist?” Anton said, “No, no”.’

Scandal: Terry's alleged comments came in response to taunts by the other player about his alleged affair with an ex-team-mate's girlfriend, Vanessa Perroncel, pictured, the prosecution said

The players then shook hands and left. Cole said he remembered little 
else about the discussion because he was ‘looking forward to a night 
out’.

Later that evening Terry phoned Ferdinand’s brother, England defender 
Rio Ferdinand, in another attempt to try to ‘smooth over’ the incident, 
but he did not take the call.

Cole insisted on sitting in the witness box as he testified, despite 
Chief Magistrate Howard Riddle suggesting that most people in the court 
would prefer it if he stood up as it would be easier to hear him.

Cole described Terry as a good friend and a great captain.

He said: ‘He’s one of the best, very inspirational. He gets the team  going in big games. He’s cool, calm and collected.’

But he said he felt an internal ‘conflict’ in giving evidence on his 
behalf, because he is also friends with Ferdinand and his brother, and 
had not wanted to get involved in the dispute.

Cole was also asked about having ‘lurid details’ about his sex life 
published in the media, an apparent reference to allegations of his 
infidelities during his marriage to Cheryl Cole. But Cole replied: ‘I 
don’t mind, I’m a grown man.’

Statements were also read from 17 Chelsea players and former manager 
Mourinho, all saying that they had never heard Terry make a racist 
comment.

Terry, 31, denies a racially aggravated public order offence.

The trial continues.
