Council bosses have threatened to rip up a pensioner’s flowerbed – because she didn’t get permission to grow plants in it.

Rose Kay decided to brighten up the council-owned area opposite her flat with some wildflowers and herbs to smarten the neighbourhood in Tiverton, Devon.

After a string of angry letters from environmental service officers and a site visit from a senior council boss she was told to remove them, otherwise they will be ripped out for her.

Mrs Kay, who has lived at the flat for four years, said: ‘I just thought it was a nice thing for the residents and no one seemed to mind it.

‘Most of the flowers I’ve planted are wild so they are in keeping with the look of the area. I like to help nature along because it encourages the bees and birds.’

She said the problems began in September after a neighbour complained about a set of table and chairs she had set up in the area so people could sit out and enjoy the sun.

But the council accused the move as ‘intimidating’ and told her to get rid of them too.

‘I put them there so people around the community could sit there and use it.

‘The council said I could sit there but I can’t leave them there so we removed them and put them in the garage,’ said Mrs Kay, who moved to the area from Lancashire in 1996.

She has received five letters from Adrian Cook, head of open spaces at Mid Devon District Council, and Paul Williams, its head of environmental services, insisting that she remove the plants.

The most recent, from Mr Williams, said: ‘It is council land and there is no permission to exclusively "use" it for benefit, nor would permission be forthcoming.

‘The buildings were built without private gardens and open space provided as a buffer to the built environment.

‘If, when the grass team arrives to cut the grass, the plants are still there, they will be instructed to remove them.’

Mrs Kay said: ‘I’m so disappointed because I’m retired and my husband works long shifts so it’s my little area of sanctuary.’

However, Mr Williams, from the council has said that the authority is not prepared to let people use its land without permission.

He said: ‘The resident was told that it was a green open space and not to be used by individuals as tended gardens.

‘There is also clearly insufficient land for every flat to have a piece of the open space as a garden which is why it is open space.’

He added: ‘Not all residents are happy with the arrangement that this resident has taken upon herself - without any permission - and the council is not prepared to have adverse possession of its land.

‘Mrs Kay has been told to remove the table and chairs and the plants and restore the council’s land to its original condition.’

Mr Williams added that Mrs Kay was asked to identify an area she thought would be ‘non-intrusive to other residents’ and also told of the possibility of allotments in the area, however, he said nothing has been forthcoming.

The pensioner has started a petition 
which 22 neighbours have signed in favour of keeping her plants – but is
 resigned to having them removed.
