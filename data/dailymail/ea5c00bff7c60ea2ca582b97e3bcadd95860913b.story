Australian of the Year and domestic violence campaigner Rosie Batty has marked her 11-year-old son Luke's one year anniversary of his murder on social media.

The 52-year-old from Tyabb, Victoria, has taken to her Twitter page to pay a heartbreaking tribute to her son who was murdered at cricket practice by his father Greg Anderson last February.

One year ago today, Luke was brutally attacked with a baseball bat and knife by his 54-year-old father during a custody visit at Tyabb cricket ground before Mr Anderson was fatally shot by police.

'My world changed a year ago today. I miss Luke every moment of every day but I push forward with courage because of everyone's support,' Ms Batty posted on Thursday morning.
