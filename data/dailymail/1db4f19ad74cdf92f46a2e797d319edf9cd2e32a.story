Embattled travellers at Dale Farm - the UK's largest illegal site - say they will barricade themselves in at the Essex camp to halt their planned eviction.

A spokesman for the community confirmed that they would 'resist the bailiffs and build barricades' in a bid to remain on the six acre plot.

Basildon Council have confirmed that they will begin eviction proceedings within weeks and that planning is advanced for the multi-million pound policing operation to carry out the court order.

A 28-day notice served on residents expired on Wednesday following a ten year row over the use of the site for permanent homes.

The travellers based at the camp have
confirmed that they are not armed and that they wish to adopt a 
peaceful approach when opposing their removal.

Resident Kathleen MCarthy said today: 'We will resist but none of us have weapons or anything like that.

'We have gas canisters but they are for fuel and will absolutely not be used as weapons.'

Protesters are planning to chain 
themselves to concrete blocks at the traveller site – part of which was 
built illegally – in the battle against the bulldozers.

Details
emerged as a ‘foreign legion’ of activists began joining the barricades
at the camp in Crays Hill, Essex, an area of which the travellers 
bought and then built on without planning permission.

Swedish Marxists and German campaigners, as well as British university students, are among those who have drifted in to the six-acre site, where about 400 of the 1,000 residents have been ordered to leave.

A press conference at the site today saw the two groups, supporters and travellers, present a united front over tactics to oppose the eviction order.

One mother, who has a six-month-old son with Down's Syndrome, told of the human impact of the mass eviction.

Margaret Culligan said: 'If this eviction goes ahead it will place an enormous strain on us as a family and his health might deteriorate. All we want is to stay in our homes.'

One supporter, who gave her name as Marina, revealed that specialists in peaceful resistance had already joined the group and were holding training sessions to show the travellers how to combat the eviction using peaceful methods.

About 80 newcomers are understood to have presented themselves at a makeshift headquarters and scores more are expected to join them over the weekend.

Tents providing temporary shelter and large gazebos for communal meals have sprung up. Police fear up to 2,000 people from 30 groups are planning to try to block the eviction, despite having no direct link to the site.

Officers believe they could use the confrontation as an excuse for politically motivated violence.

Aerial photos taken yesterday showed the occupants are turning the camp into a fortress, with watchtowers, barbed wire and hay bales and tyres that can be set alight.

High-pressure canisters that can be detonated have also been stockpiled. One activist, who declined to be named, said: ‘We will take whatever action is necessary to stop innocent people being left homeless.

‘They’re not hurting anyone. We have chains and padlocks to lock ourselves to the concrete blocks. Children will form part of the human barricade.’

Another, who covered his face with a hood and jumper, added: ‘There is no way we are leaving them (the travellers) here to be attacked by the thugs who pass themselves off as bailiffs. Yes, we are preparing for battle and want here to be our fortress.

‘What other option have these people been left with? A life in supermarket car parks is no future for these good people.’

In a sign that the operation is being
taken over by outside elements, one traveller described a meeting 
yesterday between the two groups, saying: ‘They (the anarchists) were 
telling us what to do. They seem to know exactly how to handle the 
situation.

‘They were saying there was still plenty of time to prepare and reinforcements are on their way.’

Another
said: ‘A lot of us accept we will have to move on and won’t put up much
resistance, although there’s plenty who want to fight to the end.

'It’s 
the people who’ve been turning up over the past few days who really want
to square up to the authorities.’

The evictions of 80 families living on 
52 plots are set to begin within a fortnight, ending a ten-year legal 
battle.

The travellers’ application for a High Court injunction to delay
the evictions failed on Wednesday.

A
local homeowner, who asked to remain anonymous, said: ‘There is genuine
terror about what is to come. The misery and fear we have had for years
could be nothing by comparison.

'The
fact that children could be used to make the police operation more 
difficult shows the depths that these people are prepared to stoop to. 
It’s the sort of thing a demented despot would do.’

The
travellers were moving valuables including TVs from the area in transit
vans yesterday to minimise the damage to their property when the 
confrontation begins. 

An Essex Police spokesman said that if any children took part in the protests, ‘social services would be involved’.

John Baron, the MP for Basildon and Billericay, appealed for the travellers to leave peacefully.

He said: ‘The law must be enforced 
equally and fairly, otherwise we discriminate against the law-abiding 
majority. No one group or individual can be above the law.’
