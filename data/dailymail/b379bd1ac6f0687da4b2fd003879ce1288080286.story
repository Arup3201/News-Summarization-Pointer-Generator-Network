Shawna Lynn Palmer, 22, has been charged with defrauding an insurance company after 

An aspiring beauty queen is facing fraud charges after she claimed she was unable to work her grocery-store job because of a fractured toe - before being spotted in high heels at a pageant.

Shawna Lynn Palmer, 22, has been charged with defrauding an insurance company after she told her employer, Stater Bros grocery store in Riverside, California, that she was unable to work because of a painful foot injury. 

She went to the doctor in March and was told to keep weight off the injury and given a pair of crutches.

However a few days later she was posing in her bikini- and a pair of towering stilettos - at a Long Beach beauty pageant. 

Palmer then went back to the doctor for a second visit where she claimed, according to the California Department of Insurance, that she could not put any weight on her foot or wear shoes. 

The 22-year-old was told to take several weeks off work - which she used to compete in yet more beauty pageants.

On July 3, she posted a  picture of herself on Facebook winning third place at a Harley Davidson bikini contest, wearing a black bikini and a pair of black stilettos. 

Under the grinning snap, she thanked her family, friends and boyfriend for their support. 

Palmer is facing three felony counts of defrauding an insurance company and was released on $5,000 bail.

Palmer (pictured fourth from left) at a California beauty pageant in July, boasted on social media that she won third place in this competition, all the while claiming compensation from her workplace for a foot injury

She faces a year in jail and up to three years on probation if found guilty. She will also have to pay back the $24,000. 

Byron Tucker, who works with the state's deputy insurance commissioner, told KTLA: 'People might want to say here's a young lady who had beauty and bravado in making these claims, but it really didn't add up on the brains side of it.'

Mr Tucker said it was easy to build a case against her because of her widespread social networking.
