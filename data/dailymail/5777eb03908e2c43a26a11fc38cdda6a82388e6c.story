There are touchdowns and there are touchdowns ... and then there are touchdowns like this. 

High-school quarterback Ross Bowers knew he wasn't going to get past the boy-mountains that formed his opponents' defensive line during the 4A state football championships at the Tacoma Dome in Tacoma, Washington.

So rather than get crushed under a melee of superior muscle and brawn, he somersaulted over their heads instead, and landed feet first in the end zone.

A video of the flip was soon uploaded online and has since gone viral as millions of football fans around the world shared the footage.

'I saw an opening and I took it,' he told the Seattle Times. 'Nothing was going to keep me out of the end zone and I happened to land on my feet after. It was an awesome play for me because it was my last impact on a football game in high school, and I think I'll remember that one for a while.'

A teammate told the paper: 'That was like a video-game play.' 

According to KING-TV, Bowers' mother, Joanne, is the head gymnastics coach at the University of Washington, giving the high-schooler ample opportunity to hone his acrobatic skills.

'He spends hours on the trampoline and that's what I just saw -- trampoline work right there,' coach Tom Bainter said of the touchdown.
