With three million snapped up in its first four days on sale, the new iPad is the hottest gadget around.

For some customers, however, that’s been a big problem.

An influential U.S. consumer watchdog is investigating online reports that Apple’s tablet computer generates too much heat.

The thermal camera shows the new iPad (left) is considerably warmer than iPad 2 - tallying with user complaints that the new tablet can become 'uncomfortably' warm while in use

One disgruntled customer said they were returning theirs after it reached temperatures of 47c (117f) following only ten minutes of use.

Dutch technology website Tweakers said the new iPad, which went on sale last Friday, was 5c hotter than its predecessor when running.

Customers have complained that the gadget is ‘too hot to hold’, particularly when playing games, prompting a spokesman for the U.S. watchdog Consumer Reports to announce it was conducting its own ‘scientific analysis with thermal imaging’.

It found that the product became ‘significantly hotter’ after playing the popular game Infinity Blade II, with temperatures of 47c recorded on the device’s front and back.

However, tester Donna Tapellini said the gadget was ‘not especially uncomfortable if held for a brief period’.

Users have claimed that the problem with overheating iPads is particularly bad with 3D games

One user of Apple’s official support website said: 'I think we all know what we have to 
do - which is to return the iPad.

'They 
simply did not do a good enough job with this iPad, maybe next year. 
They also have so much money now that they are giving it away to the 
stock holders.

'It was 
reported that Apple sold over 3 million iPads over the weekend. I hope 
they all return their iPad forcing Apple to revise and fix this iPad 
sooner rather than a year from now.'

A spokesman for Apple said the new iPad’s performance was ‘well within our thermal specifications’, adding that concerned customers should contact the company.

The launch of the iPhone 4 in 2010 was also troubled, with buyers complaining that the handset could not connect to the internet or make calls if held in a certain way.

Smokin' hot? Apple forum users have claimed that the new gadget is far hotter than previous iPads and can be uncomfortable to use

Tweakers said: 'On the left is the new iPad - with a temperature of 33.6c in the lower right hand corner.

'The iPad 2 scored in the same place a temperature of 28.3c, a difference of 5.3c.'

The Dutch bloggers say that their image tallies with complaints on Apple websites.

'Forum messages noted that the location of the processor is a hot spot,' says Tweakers.

'At 33.6c, the iPhone is not too hot to touch, although the warmer housing is very noticeable.'

On blogs, some iPad owners have even claimed that it goes into ‘cool down mode’ and freezes until it has reached a stable temperature.

The
issue seems to be confined to the bottom left hand side, though some 
people said that the whole left side of the device was too hot.

User
Faatty began the discussion by posting: ‘It gets rather warm/hot after 
30minutes of usage. It has never happened on my iPad 2. Do you think 
it's harmless or..?’

Rawwave
added that his got ‘almost too warm to hold whilst malegno said: ‘The 
heat on mine is concentrated on the bottom-left although the whole left 
side seems to be hotter than the right side.’

Forum messages noted that the location of the processor is a hot spot. At 33.6c, the iPhone is not too hot to touch, although the warmer housing is very noticeable.

In a separate threat on the Apple 
website user znz212 wrote: ‘It begins getting warm within about 10 
minutes for me, and after about 25 it's quite hot to touch (not hot 
enough to burn or anything, but hotter than it feels like it should be).

‘I can even feel the heat on the front - the top half of the screen is warmer than the bottom half.

‘It
cools down very fast (within 5 minutes) when locked or even on the home
screen, so I'm not sure if the heat is normal with the new chip.’

Apple
has not addressed the problem directly but customers who took their 
iPad to a store have written that it has been exchanged for a new one 
with no problems.

This is not the first time that the company has run into teething problems with its gadgets.

The launch of the iPhone 4 was marred by reports that it would not connect to the Internet if it was held in a certain way.

Apple solved the ‘grip of death’ issue by giving out a free silicone rubber band to put round the phone.

Among
the other other glitches have a software problem with iPhones and iPod 
touches which stopped the alarm clocks working until Apple issued an 
update to sort it out.

The
iPad went on sale earlier this month and was widely praised for its 
3.1million pixel 9.7" Retina display, which is the sharpest out of any 
tablet computer.

On the official Apple website it says the iPad should stay below 35c for optimum ‘operating temperature'.
