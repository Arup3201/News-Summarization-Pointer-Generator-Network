The Tattooing of Minors Act 1969 makes it a criminal offence for a tattooist to ink anyone under the age of 18

A tattoo parlour is being investigated for inking an underage teenager with 'awful' upside down and wonky sergeant stripes - called the 'worst tattoo ever done' by his mother.

Robin Elliott, who is just 17, came home after getting three upside down sergeant stripes tattooed on his right arm at a tattoo studio in Dymchurch, Kent.

His mother Michelle exploded in anger and demanded her son take her to the LoveTattoo studio run by Dagmar Oates - who also reads tarot cards and does botox and dermal fillers - but found the studio closed.

The Tattooing of Minors Act 1969 makes it a criminal offence for a tattooist to ink anyone under the age of 18.

Michelle and husband Jason were so 'outraged' at the tattoo they called the police and local council.

Michelle said: 'This person thinks they can tattoo. She is willing too tattoo under age kids and needs too be stopped and shamed.'

She called her a 'monster' and said her tattoos were marking youngsters for life with awful inkings.

She then posted a photo of her son's 'awful' tattoo on Facebook, adding: 'This is what a so called tattooist did to my underage son! DO NOT Get a tattoo done at LoveTattoo in Dymchurch.'

Speaking last week, Michelle said it was the 'worst tattoo she had ever seen', adding: 'He was silly for having it done and regrets having it, but no-one should be subject to such shoddy work.'

Father Jason said Dagmar Oates should have asked for ID from Robin before inking him and said: 'The tattoo cost £5 - you can see why.'

Writing on her Facebook page Dagmar Oates claimed that she was being persecuted and that Robin had told her he was 18.

A sign on her tattoo shop door reads that she has 'closed for winter' and will be 'back in May',

Mrs Oates' Skillpages entry reads: 'Tottooing (sic) is one of my hidden skills. I just love to ink...anything...i welcome tatt parties & home visits as i am mobile.'

A spokesman for Kent Police said: 'We are aware of a case of a 17-year-old old who was given a tattoo - we have reported this to Trading Standards.'

A spokesman for Shepway District Council said it was investigating the tattoo parlour, adding: 'We are aware of certain concerns about this business which has been registered with the council.

'We are following up these concerns and officers from both licensing and environmental health will be visiting the premises.'

When council officers visited the tattoo shop recently they found it closed with the 'closed till May sign' still on the doorway.
