Arsenal Ladies and England forward Kelly Smith has discussed her battles with injuries, alcohol addiction, depression and  suicidal thoughts.

The 36-year-old is an icon of the women's game but her career has been plagued by injuries, from breaking her leg in 2004 while with the New Jersey Wildcats to missing out on the England squad for World Cup qualifiers as recent as June due to a quad strain.  

Smith admitted in 2011 she would 'drink every day until I passed out, vodka usually' following her leg-break in America but, as she prepares to face Germany at a sold-out Wembley on Sunday, the veteran believes she has turned the corner.

'I struggled with injuries and alcohol addiction through to that part. Being lonely out in the States, not knowing how to cope with the injuries that I had,' Smith begins.

'Really in a low, low state. I got help for that, though, and I'm in such a better place now that if I am injured [as I have been] in the last few years, I find that my coping strategy is a lot better to deal with.

'Injuries are part of the game, it's just obviously how you deal with them. Now, I'm a lot better. I've been a little bit unfortunate with injuries but what I'm proud of is I haven't given up.

'It's been tough but I kept pushing through. Always wanting to come back stronger and fitter. Still want to play for Arsenal, still want to play for England at the age of 36, and I think that speaks volumes.

'I had suicidal thoughts. I don't think there were ever real actions of me going through with it. But I certainly had thoughts of ending my life due to the fact that I couldn't play football. I was really in a low state, drinking a lot. 

'Not knowing how to cope with not playing football. I removed myself from a lot of my team-mates and was by myself a lot of the time. That probably didn't help. I struggled. It was tough times but they're in the past now and just looking to the future.' 

England women play in front of a record crowd of 55,000 fans at Wembley on Sunday when they take on European champions Germany.
