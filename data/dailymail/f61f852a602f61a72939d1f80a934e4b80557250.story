Absence, as the saying goes, makes the heart grow fonder. And apparently it makes the face more attractive, too.

For despite having kept an uncharacteristically low profile since leaving the X Factor judging panel in 2011, Cheryl Cole has been voted the celebrity most women want to look like.

She has the most desirable eyes, hair, cheekbones and skin tone, according to a recent survey. And according to clinical psychologist Dr Linda Blair it is because she has been absent from television screens, while Victoria Beckham, who is rarely far from the media spotlight, was among the stars women least want to copy.

Dr Blair said: 'If we see something all the time we also get bored with it, no matter how fascinating it is. 

'So it's actually a really wise trick to not be in the spotlight all the time. Over-exposure is boring. Being slightly inaccessible is endearing and attractive.'

Cheryl, who rose to fame after winning Popstars: The Rivals in 2002, was once named the sexiest woman in the world by FHM magazine.

In this latest survey almost a quarter of women asked said they would like to have her thick auburn hair and large dark eyes.

11 per cent said they wished they had her golden skin tone and 10 per cent were keen to copy her nose.

Miss
Cole, whose recent hiatus from the television might have pushed her out
of people's minds, was one of 15 British and American female 
celebrities survey recipients were presented with.

They
were asked by beauty brand Transformulas to select their favourite 
features from stars ranging from Miss Cole, to Victoria Beckham, to 
Angelina Jolie.

Mrs Beckham didn't appear in the top three for any feature. 

Other
celebrities did, however, including Jennifer Aniston for her hair, 
Keira Knightley for her cheekbones, and Eva Longaria for her skin tone.

According to psychologists it is because the pop star has been away from our TV screens, and absence makes the heart grow fonder when it comes to admiring style

But the only feature Miss Cole was beaten on was her mouth. The survey found that American actress Angelina Jolie's smile is more popular.

Explaining the psychology behind why Miss Cole's features are attractive, Dr Blair said: 'When it comes to attractiveness what we are looking for is someone who is not quite symmetrical. Perfect symmetry is boring, so you want it to be slightly off-beat.

'Also you are looking for some sign that that individual is interested in the world around them, and in particular about you. And that comes mainly in the eyes. Eyes that are dark, or that have large pupils, show interest. 

'When we get interested in someone our pupils enlarge, we can't help it. And when we are interested in someone else they feel flattered so they think that you're more attractive.

She added: 'We've been conditioned to think that darker skin is more beautiful because it's associated with the ability to take a holiday and get a tan. 

'Normally you would go for really glowing skin and good colour which shows good blood flow and so the tan thing is something we've been conditioned to through advertising and things.' 

Miss Cole, was married to footballer Ashley Cole for four years until 2010, has undergone a glamorous make-over since breaking into the music industry 11 years ago. 

Her hair has got fuller, her teeth whiter, and her skin a deeper shade of tan.

But her smile has remained the same and Dr Blair said that could be why she was beaten by Miss Jolie to top the best-mouth category.

Dr Blair said: 'With the smile, if you show your teeth a whole lot that usually is a sign of appeasement, you don't feel quite confident. 

'If it's a sort of gentle relaxed smile then that is very, very attractive because they're saying we're equals and I'm really engaged in you.'
