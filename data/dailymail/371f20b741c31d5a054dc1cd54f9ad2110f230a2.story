Barcelona will take a one-goal advantage into the second leg of their last-16 Champions League clash against Manchester City following a 2-1 win at the Etihad Stadium.

Luis Suarez's first-half double was enough to hand the Catalan giants victory, as they take two valuable away goals into the second-leg clash on March 18 at the Nou Camp.

Here, Sportsmail's Martin Keown gives his big match verdict to Tuesday night's events in Manchester.

Luis Suarez celebrates the crucial first away goal for Barcelona after an emphatic finish past Joe Hart

Manuel Pellegrini wants his teams to play with two strikers.

That’s his philosophy but it left Man City exposed, especially in the first half.

They only played one striker in this fixture last year, so he clearly wanted to go on the offensive. But David Silva and Samir Nasri are not designed to chase and press teams.

They needed one striker sitting deep but with two further forward and the City midfield chasing shadows, Barcelona could dominate.

Playing against Barcelona, you don’t want to give anything away.

But that’s exactly what the first goal was. A gift. It was far too easy for Luis Suarez.

The second was not too good, either. Fernando was dragged wide and with no midfield protection, Vincent Kompany came flying out of the defensive line.

That left space for Messi to drive into and once City started retreating, left back Jordi Alba bombed forward and was able to pick out his pass, which is not hard when the defenders are like mannequins.

I thought we might have seen the best of Lionel Messi, but he was excellent.

He receives the ball in positions where almost every player in the world would lay it off.

It was the Messi of old — though I can’t remember Messi missing a penalty or spurning an open goal too often!

It feels like another false dawn for City.

Before the match all the talk was of how they can match Barca, but they were still short.

They did well to get it back to 2-1 but it will be difficult at the Nou Camp. It seems that City’s quest for Champions League greatness is going to take longer than they thought.

Barcelona's front three were magnificent.

Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Neymar were all so willing to run straight at defenders. It was terrific to watch.

With Suarez as a focal point in the middle, Neymar and Messi could cut inside onto their stronger foot and they tore into City.

No longer do Barcelona just pass for the sake of it. They are more direct, can play on the counter and their current system is getting the best out of Messi and Neymar.
