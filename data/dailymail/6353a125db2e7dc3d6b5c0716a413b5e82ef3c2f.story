She had hunted frantically for them for hours, so when Zoe Kerr heard that her two missing dogs were safe she was naturally overjoyed.

Her beloved pets had been found after running off across moorland and given to a local farmer for safe-keeping overnight, she was told.

But Miss Kerr’s relief turned to horror when police went to the farm and found that both dogs had been shot with a bolt gun and their bodies hidden in a barn.

Police have arrested a farmer, Simon 
Tidswell, in connection with the incident. He has been released on bail 
pending further inquiries.

Hairdresser Miss Kerr, 36, was tending
her horses at stables near her home in Haworth, West Yorkshire, on 
Mothering Sunday when the dogs ran off at about 1pm.

Frank, a German shepherd cross, and 
Macy, a husky cross, jumped out of the back of her pick-up and headed 
across the moors.

Miss Kerr couldn’t find the two-year-old dogs anywhere
and enlisted friends and members of the local young farmers group to 
help the search.

‘I was frantic with worry,’ she said. 
‘We covered about 90 per cent of the moor and looked for them well after
nightfall without success.’

The following morning Miss Kerr 
received a call from a local resident who said her husband, John 
Hodgson, had been walking his dogs on the heather moorland on Sunday and
had found both her pets.

Mr Hodgson’s wife, Sam, had contacted 
the local dog warden on the Monday morning and told him where the 
missing dogs could be found. She had then discovered Miss Kerr’s details
through a Facebook campaign and rang her with the good news.

Mrs Hodgson said: ‘If John had known 
what was going to happen to them he would never have handed them over 
[to someone else to give to the dog warden]. He is gutted.’

'I take full responsibility for them 
escaping and running away. I feel so guilty, it's killing me, and I have
not slept since Sunday.

'It was all so unnecessary, my lovely dogs did not deserve to be killed.

'They were apprehended by a third party and did not need to be destroyed.'

Police officers visited Mr Tidswell’s farm later that day and reportedly found the dogs’ bodies under a pile of wood in a barn.

Miss Kerr was told that Frank and Macy
had both been shot at point-blank range with a bolt gun. Police were 
baffled by the apparent ‘execution’.

Miss Kerr, whose other dog, 
seven-month-old Dave, did not run off, said her four-year-old daughter 
Esme has been left heartbroken. Both pets were microchipped and 
well-behaved.

‘I’m a country type and understand 
that if my dogs had been worrying sheep, a farmer would be fully within 
his rights to shoot them,’ she said.

‘I would have been upset, but I 
could have accepted that. But the dogs had not caused any damage. It was
all so unnecessary, my lovely dogs did not deserve to be killed.’

Mr Tidswell was unavailable for comment yesterday.

A police spokesman said: ‘A man has 
been arrested on suspicion of criminal damage and released on bail. The 
bodies of the dogs have been seized by the RSPCA pending further 
investigation.’

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
