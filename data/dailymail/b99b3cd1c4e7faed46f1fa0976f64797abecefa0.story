Love triangle: Singer Bryan Adams fathered a child with his PA Alicia Grimaldi but failed to tell his love Antonia Harrison

When it comes to expressing romantic regret in epic love songs, Bryan Adams is considered something of a master.

Now the Canadian rocker may need all his songwriting skills after apparently failing to inform his lover he was expecting a child with his personal assistant.

Adams has denied even being in a long-term relationship with glamorous advertising executive Antonia Harrison, 36.

But she says they had been dating each other for two years and that Adams has still not told her the truth about Cambridge-educated Alicia Grimaldi’s pregnancy.

Antonia refused to see the singer, who is best known for his hit ballad (Everything I Do) I Do It For You, on learning about the baby.

But friends say he has tried to get back in touch with Antonia and they believe he wanted to see her again.

A friend of Antonia’s revealed: ‘Bryan has never confirmed to Antonia that the child is even his but we can only assume so. He has still never answered a direct question on it.

Lots of people believe he would have preferred never to tell the public about the baby.

‘Maybe Bryan would have liked to continue seeing Antonia and looking after Alicia and the baby.

‘But he didn’t have any choice when it came to Antonia – she refused to see him again after hearing the news.

‘They did tentatively speak as friends on many occasions. I believe Antonia had a thought in her mind that it could all go back to normal.’

Last week, 51-year-old Adams was pictured outside his £2.4 million London home with his first child, three-month-old Mirabella Bunny, who was born on Good Friday.

The baby has come as a shock to Antonia, who began seeing Adams at the start of 2009.The friend said: ‘Antonia had kept their relationship to herself for a few months. She smiled a lot around that time – a lot.’

Adams would call Antonia whenever he was in London and arrange to meet.

‘He is a very, very busy man and obsessive about not stopping for one minute. For a clean-living man, that is his addiction. He travels perhaps two weeks out of every four. Antonia saw him when he was in Britain.

‘He made her glow. Even though she didn’t like to talk about him, you could tell that she was very happy. She is a passionate character so the relationship was obviously very passionate.

‘They would talk about photography, fashion, music and film. They’re both into anything cultural. Antonia studied history at university and reads everything and anything.

‘She likes to learn from people and found his knowledge of world topics a very attractive aspect of his personality.

‘They also found each other very physically attractive.’

Antonia also has a high-powered job as deputy general manager of the luxury atelier division of creative ad agency Leo Burnett and was happy to accept the erratic nature of their relationship.

The friend said: ‘I believe that there was a “we live for today” attitude between them. But he never gave off any signs of wanting to settle down and Antonia’s not a jealous person anyway.’

The couple were seen at upmarket restaurants where teetotal and strict vegan Bryan would nurse a hot water with lemon.

Sometimes he would sing to her.

‘I think when they were together it was their time – hiding away from the world in his place. It was all very romantic, I suppose.’

Bryan was forever welcoming guests into his many homes, and troubled actress Lindsay Lohan once stayed for three weeks with girlfriend Sam Ronson.

Late singer Amy Winehouse also stayed at his house on the Caribbean island of Mustique, which she ‘hated – he only had beetroot and carrot juice in the fridge’.

Despite this generosity, Antonia’s friend said: ‘When he is busy then love life comes second. I know an ex-girlfriend of his from way back and she said he was very selfish and everything was only on his terms.’

In October, Antonia was invited

to spend time with Adams after his concert in Manchester, and the couple spent the night together in the city’s Lowry Hotel.

But by this time Alicia was already pregnant.

Alicia, 31, who is the daughter of the Isle of Wight’s deputy lieutenant Peter Grimaldi, met Adams in 2004 while helping to set up his Bryan Adams Foundation, which provides grants to support vulnerable people.

Mr Adams’ spokesman Gary Farrow last night dismissed the friend’s comments and added: ‘It’s all been done before.’
