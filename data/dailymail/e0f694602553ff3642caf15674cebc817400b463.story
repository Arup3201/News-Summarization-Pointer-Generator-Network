Many couples thinking about downsizing when they retire, but one Baltimore couple have taken the tradition to an extreme.

Greg Cantori, 52, and his wife have a new home measuring 238 square feet, which comes with two bedrooms, a kitchen and a bathroom.

The couple paid $19,000 for the 'tiny house' which is built on a trailer so can be moved around the country.

Moving house: The tiny-house was built onto a trailer frame that can be towed

New life: Greg Cantori with his daughter Andrea, 19, center, and wife Renee in their 238-square-foot 'tiny-house.' The Cantoris intend to downsize into the tiny-house in the future and taking it with them as they travel

Although their new home is compact, every inch of space has been well utilised with a tiny 
stainless-steel fireplace, a closet and a combination washer-dryer.

Friends come pop over for dinner as the 
table in the living room/dining area can seat up to five people if folded out and the kitchen has an RV stove, microwave and small refrigerator.

In 
the bathroom is a full-sized shower and a composting toilet - the loft accessible by ladder has two bedrooms.

'No wasted space,' said the father-of two.  'It's all about not wasting,'  he told the Baltimore Sun.

Their tiny home - which Mr Cantori says is smaller than the walk in closet in their current home - was built by a lawyer from 
Kansas who intended to live there with his family of three.

But as the family grew he sold his home to Mr Cantori who now has it sitting in his Pasadena yard.

'It's so cheap — that's what's so 
cool about this,' said Mr Cantori. He believes the white walls and 16 windows help give the wooden structure a sense of spaciousness.

Mr Cantori and his wife Renee now plan to split his time between the small home and a sailboat.

Environmentally friendly: For Cantori, the affordability of a tiny house is part of the draw, but also the ability to use less energy

Downsizing: Greg Cantori, right, and his wife Renee. Their retirement home is one-tenth the size of the average new American house
