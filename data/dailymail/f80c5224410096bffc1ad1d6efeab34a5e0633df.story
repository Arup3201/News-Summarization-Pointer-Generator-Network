Michael Brown died from a 'kill shot' to the top of the head, a renowned medical examiner revealed today - but could have survived his five other bullet wounds.

Dr Michael Baden, who was asked by the family to perform an independent autopsy, told a press conference in Ferguson, Missouri on Monday he reassured the teen's mother, Lesley McSpadden, that her son had not suffered.

The family's autopsy, which was released on Sunday, revealed the unarmed 18-year-old had been shot at least six times by police officer Darren Wilson in the St Louis suburb on August 9.

Family lawyer Benjamin Crump described the teen's death as an 'execution in broad daylight'. He said it was important for the family to have their own autopsy results as they did not trust the work of the local police. Scroll down for video

Ms McSpadden had just one question for her lawyers and medical examiners: 'What else do we need to get 
them to arrest the killer of my child?'

Dr Baden said the number of shots Michael Brown had suffered could have been revealed on day one of the investigation as withholding the information causes the family more pain.

The doctor, a former chief medical examiner for New York City, said: 'We can answer those questions on day one... telling the family on day one, can be helpful in a trying time.'

Attorney Daryl Parks said that the shot which killed Michael supported eye-witness reports that his head was in the downward position, trying to surrender to the officer.

Shawn Parcells, a forensic pathologist who assisted Dr Baden, used an anatomical diagram to explain each of the six shots they found.

Assistant medical examiner Shawn Parcells indicates that the wound which struck Michael Brown's forearm could have hit from behind or when his hands were raised

This sketch from Dr Michael Baden's post-mortem examination report showed the places where Michael Brown was shot. Two bullets entered his head - one through his eye - and four bullets hit his right arm

The 18-year-old was shot twice in the head and four times on the arm.

One bullet entered and exited Brown several times. That shot struck the teen above the right eyeball, went through his face, left through his jaw and re-entered his 
collarbone.

It is believed that five of the shots hit Brown on the front of his body.

However
 Parcells said that the gunshot wound to Brown's forearm appeared to be 
consistent with someone walking away or putting their arms up in a 
surrender or defensive manner before adding, 'but we don't know'.

Following
 the family's press conference on Monday, St Louis County medical 
examiner Mary Case said Brown had suffered between six and eight gunshot
 wounds and was shot from the front.

The teenager also had marijuana in his system when he died, a source told The Washington Post.

Michael Brown's mother, Lesley McSpadden, wept on Monday as she appeared alongside family attorney Benjamin Crump, who discussed details of a private autopsy on her son. The examination revealed that 18-year-old Brown was shot six times, including twice in the head 

Family attorney Benjamin Crump said 
during a TV interview on Monday morning that the family had ordered an independent autopsy because 
they did not trust local law enforcement.

Michael Brown was most likely killed by a shot to the top of his head, a medical examiner said on Monday

He said: 'They did not want to rely on the autopsy from St Louis law enforcement officials who they believe executed their son in broad daylight.

'Our clients understood that relying on the police autopsy was not a good thing.'

The Department of Justice is currently conducting a third autopsy on Michael Brown.

Brown's mother wept today as she spoke out following the devastating autopsy results which were released on Sunday.

Lesley McSpadden appeared on GMA on Monday along with attorney Benjamin Crump who said the family were deeply troubled by the independent autopsy results.

Mr
 Crump said: 'The witnesses were telling the truth. Michael Brown Jr was
 shot multiple times and most troubling was the head shot.'

Ms McSpadden had asked that autopsy questions not be directed to her.

She wept as she said: 'We want justice... being fair.'

When
 asked by GMA anchor Robin Roberts what would bring justice for the 
family, Ms McSpadden replied: 'Arresting this man and making him 
accountable for his actions.'  

The
 autopsy was conducted by Dr Michael M Baden, the former chief medical 
examiner for New York City. Baden has testified in several high-profile cases, including the O.J. Simpson murder trial.

While Dr Baden did not comment on the heated
 debate surrounding Wilson's actions, he did say the sheer amount of gun
 shots was out of the ordinary.

'In my capacity as the forensic 
examiner for the New York State Police, I would say, "You’re not 
supposed to shoot so many times,"' Dr Baden told the New York Times. 'Right now there is too little information to forensically reconstruct the shooting.'

The newspaper said the bullets did not appear to have come from very close range because there was no gunpowder on his body.

St Louis County Police released preliminary results of their autopsy, KSDK reported. The report concluded that the teen died of gunshot wounds but would not specify how many bullets had hit the teenager.

The autopsy, which was conducted the day after the teen died, is preliminary. No further details about Brown's death will be released by police until toxicology results become available in the next four weeks.

The
 results of the post-mortem examination emerged as Missouri's governor 
ordered the state National Guard into Ferguson after it was convulsed by
 yet another night of clashes between police and protesters.

Governor
 Jay Nixon said the National Guard would help 'in restoring peace and 
order' to Ferguson, where protests continued last night.

Police
 said they fired tear gas and rubber bullets in response to gunfire, 
looting, vandalism and protesters who hurled Molotov cocktails.

'These
 violent acts are a disservice to the family of Michael Brown and his 
memory and to the people of this community who yearn for justice to be 
served and to feel safe in their own homes,' Nixon said in a statement.

The
 National Guard is a reserve military force, and its deployment marks a 
serious escalation of the crackdown on dissent in Ferguson, which has a majority African-American population.

Dr
 Baden's post-mortem examination found Brown was shot a total of six 
times, with four bullet wounds in his right arm and two in his head.

The final shot appears to have entered Brown's head at the top of the skull suggesting his head was bowed down at the time.

'This
 one here looks like his head was bent downward,' he said of the wound 
at the top of Brown's skull. 'It can be because he’s giving up, or 
because he’s charging forward at the officer.'

Dr
 Baden, 80, is one of only 400 board-certified forensic pathologists in the 
country and he has reviewed autopsies for both President John F Kennedy 
and Martin Luther King Jr.

He has performed 20,000 autopsies and hosted the HBO show Autopsy.

He
 criticized authorities in St Louis county for keeping details of 
Brown's death concealed - which has only made the community more 
enraged.

'People have been asking: How many times was he shot? This information could have been released on Day One,' Dr. Baden said.

'They don’t do that, even as feelings built up among the citizenry that there was a cover-up. We are hoping to alleviate that.'

Considering the sensitivity around Brown's death, Dr Baden decided to waive his usual $10,000 fee.

The
 Brown family's attorney, Benjam L Crump, paid to fly Dr Baden out on 
Sunday to perform the autopsy at Austin A Layne Mortuary.

He says the autopsy results prove that Wilson's actions were unjustified.

'The
 sheer number of bullets and the way they were scattered all over his 
body showed this police officer had a brazen disregard for the very 
people he was supposed to protect in that community,' Mr. Crump said.

'We
 want to make sure people understand what this case is about: This case 
is about a police officer executing a young unarmed man in broad 
daylight.'

Following Brown's death, Ferguson has become a hot-bed of protest, and the Rev Jesse Jackson thinks the latest autopsy results will only lead to more outrage.

'This is bound to escalate tensions,' Rev Jackson told CNN. 'This is a very provocative report.'

Dr Baden consulted with the St Louis County Medical Examiner before performing his autopsy.

Brown's body is expected to undergo a total of three autopsies, with U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder scheduling a rare extra examination by the Justice Department.

The Ferguson Police Department has not commented on the latest autopsy results.
