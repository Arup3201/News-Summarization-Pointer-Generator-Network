Gerard Pique believes there are 'no words' to describe Lionel Messi following the Argentine's latest hat-trick in a Barcelona shirt during his side's 5-1 win against Espanyol on Sunday.

Messi's third hat-trick in four games saw the forward bring his goalscoring tally to 402, while sparking Luis Enrique's side into life in the Catalan derby.

Pique, who put Barca into a 3-1 lead with a second-half header, struggled to think of any terms that would adequately describe his team-mate's impact on the side.

The defender said: 'There are no words to describe Messi. He's given us so much that, I repeat, there are no words to describe everything he's done for us.'

Barca boss Enrique was also full of praise for Messi after the 27-year-old's first-half finish spared the home side's blushes following Sergio Garcia's opener for Espanyol.

Enrique said: 'Today, Leo wasn't only decisive with his goals, but also with the way he set up chances and in his defensive play.

'He was extremely involved all over the pitch and we have seen that since the beginning of the season.'
