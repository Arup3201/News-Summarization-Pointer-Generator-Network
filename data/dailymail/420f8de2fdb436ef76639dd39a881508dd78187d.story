She has walked the catwalk for Chanel, Balmain and Oscar de la Renta and even occupies a much coveted place as a Victoria's Secret Angel.

But Cameron Russell has warned young girls away from the career choice she made eight years ago.

Speaking at the annual TED (Technology, Entertainment, Design) conference in Palm Springs, U.S., the 25-year-old spoke out about the importance of not choosing a career that is 'out of your control.'

Warning: Victoria's Secret model Cameron Russell has warned young girl's away from her career choice

She said: 'What I really want to say to these 
little girls, is "Why? You know, you can be anything",

'You 
could be the President of the Unites States or the inventor of the next 
internet or a ninja cardio-thoracic surgeon poet, which would be awesome
because you would be the first one.'

The model, who has featured in campaigns for Belstaff, Louis Vuitton and Calvin Klein, added: 'Saying you want to be a model when you want to grow up is akin to saying you want to win the Powerball when you grow up.

'It's out of your control and it's awesome but it's not a career path.

'I am the recipient of a legacy - I've received all these benefits from a deck stacked in my favour.'

Not all it's cracked up to be: Cameron says modelling is 'awesome' but not a career path
