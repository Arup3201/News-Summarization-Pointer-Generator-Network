As England to prepare for friendly competition at Wembley Wednesday night, Sportsmail gives you the lowdown on Norway.

The most experienced member of Norway’s squad is 81-cap Morten Gamst Pedersen, who played for Blackburn between 2004 and 2013. He’s at Rosenborg now.

Norway’s current squad contains four UK-based players — Mats Daehli (Cardiff), Stefan Johansen (Celtic), Joshua King (Blackburn) and Alexander Tettey (Norwich).

Knows his stuff: Coach Per-Mathias Hogmo has managed Norway at almost every youth level

Norway have won just one match this year — a 2-1 victory against Moldova in January. They have also drawn with the Czech Republic, Russia and UAE, and lost to Poland and France.

Coach Per-Mathias Hogmo has managed Norway U19 (1993), Norway U15 (’94), Norway U16 (’95), Norway U17 (’96), Norway Women (’97-2000), Norway U21 (2000-03) and Norway (2013).
