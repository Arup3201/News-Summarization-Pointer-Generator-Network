Ka-paw! This is the moment a naught bear gets caught red-pawed as he knocks out a Santa decoration with one blow.

Robert Martinez, a wildlife photographer from Glendora, California, set up a camera in the Big Dalton Canyon and was shocked when he saw the grizzly strike.

Footage shows the large mammal wandering out of the woods sniffing out and attempting to nibble Mr Claus. He then swipes the jolly man with one arm.

Ka-paw: Footage shows the large mammal punching a Santa garden decoration 

Out with one blow: Mr Claus is instantly floored and lays lifeless on the ground 

Back for more: Martinez thinks he captured the same 'huge male bear' who has been recorded in a same spot several times before

The plush ornament is instantly floored.

The bear is seen nuzzling it into the leaves headfirst.

Martinez titled his video 'Merry Christmas! Santa gets KO'd by a Bear!'  

Over the years he has filmed dozens of animals around his hometown.

Along with bears, he has spotted mountain lions, deer and foxes roaming around.  

Four weeks ago, he placed the miniature Santa by one of his trail cameras to see if wildlife would interact with it. 

Commenting on the resulting footage of the bear, he told KTLA: 'I haven’t seen any bears on my cameras for a few months, so I was pleasantly surprised and happy that he knocked out Santa right in front of the camera.'

Martinez thinks he captured the same 'huge male bear' who has been recorded in a same spot several times before.

He says his videos are intended to bring awareness to local wildlife, especially mountain lions.
