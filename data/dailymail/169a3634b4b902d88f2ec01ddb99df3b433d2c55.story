Tom Cleverley is confident he can revive his Manchester United career because he 'is a (Louis) Van Gaal type of player'.

The midfielder struggled under David Moyes last season starting on just 18 Premier League games but is convinced he can thrive under new manager Van Gaal.

'I watched the manager’s Holland team in the World Cup and from that I think I’m going to be his type of player,' said Cleverley.

'I have to show that in training and most importantly games. I think there’s a place for me but I have to prove it.'

Cleverley missed out on a place in Roy Hodgson's World Cup squad but says the time off has helped him.

He said: 'I managed to have a good break and recharge my batteries. Now we’re back and all trying to impress the boss.

'We know what he wants – a passing and 
moving style. He’s very clear and we have a good group of lads who are 
willing to learn. We made a good start the other night and we’ll see how
 we go from there.'

Cleverley played 45 minutes in Manchester
 United's 7-0 win over LA Galaxy on Thursday and he will get another 
chance to impress Van Gaal when United take of Roma in a pre-season 
friendly in Denver on Saturday.

And Van Gaal has already confirmed that the 24-year-old will play the entire 90 minutes. He said: 'All the players will play for 45 minutes except Tom Cleverley, who will have to play the whole match.'

Competition for places in United's midfielder has increased with the signing of Ander Herrera from Athletic Bilbao and Van Gaal also retains an interest in Roma midfielder Kevin Strootman.

Michael Carrick, however, has been ruled out for 12 weeks after picking up an ankle injury in training.
