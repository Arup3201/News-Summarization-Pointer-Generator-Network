Former vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin said lat night's debate moderator was 'tough' on Paul Ryan and allowed Joe Biden to 'run roughshod over the conversation'.

Palin, who went up against Biden in the during the last election, told Fox News she was unimpressed with Martha Raddatz, saying: 'Really tough format for someone like a Paul Ryan or anybody else up against Joe Biden, when the moderator allowed one candidate to absolutely run roughshod over the conversation, over the opponent.

'It reminded me... of watching a musk ox run across the tundra with somebody underfoot. And in this case, when it came to style, it was Paul Ryan underfoot because of the moderator allowing Biden to do the interrupting, to kind of take control of the conversation.'

The reporter faced conservative 
criticism even before the start of the debate after it was revealed that
 Obama was a personal acquaintance who had attended her wedding in 1991.

Backing a winner? Sarah Palin waited until the last-minute until she backed Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan for the White House

Raddatz faced a tough job as 
moderator of last night's vice-presidential debate, just a week after 
Jim Lehrer's widely derided performance at the helm of the first 
presidential debate.

Despite
 Palin's criticism most commentators praised her no-nonsense demeanour, 
after Jim Lehrer's much-derided performance in last week's presidential 
debate.

According to Buzzfeed, Raddatz spoke 380 more words than Lehrer did last week, as she said 1,940 words during Thursday's debate while Lehrer only said 1,560.

Some Twitter users praised the control that she showed throughout the debate. Film critic Roger Ebert wrote that she 'makes a strong impression. Knows her stuff'.

CNN
 reporter Roland Martin tweeted 'Martha Raddatz is not messing around. 
You hear that Jim Lehrer? She ain't allowing filibustering!'

When asked after the debate, Romney 
spokesperson Michael Steel told Politico said 'I'm not sure I would say'
 that Raddatz was fair.

'I
 thought she obviously asserted herself more than Lehrer did, but there 
was still a great deal of crosstalk, there was still a great deal of 
difficulty making points in a reasonable and progressive fashion,' he 
told the site.

Raddatz faced a particular challenge
 given that she is the only one of the four debate moderators 
who is not a television news anchor.

She has spent much of her career covering foreign news and specialising in the Middle East.

In keeping with the tradition that the moderators briefly address the audience before taking their seat on stage, the 59-year-old Raddatz said that she isn't used to the fuss surrounding the debate.

She also added that, given her experience in war zones, she isn't used to having her back to the action.

The role of the moderator was 
highlighted following the first debate between Republican nominee Mitt 
Romney and President Barack Obama, when veteran Lehrer was 
criticised for his lacklustre performance.

Predecessor: So-called 'Dean of Moderators' Jim Lehrer was widely criticized after last week's presidential debate because he allowed the candidates to simply steamroll over him

Lehrer
 came out of retirement to moderate the debate last week - making it his
 12th and earning him the title of having moderated the most debates in 
U.S. history - and tarnished his previously stellar reputation.

Romney
 steamrolled over Lehrer as he tried to intervene, and the President 
alternated between looking on longingly for help or giving a jab at the 
PBS newsman.

Some conservatives were worried about Raddatz's neutrality in the days leading up to the debate as it was revealed that then-Senator Obama attended her wedding.

Obama went to law school with Raddatzâ€™s first husband Julius Genachowski, who is the current chairman of the Federal Communications Commission.

ABC News, which has employed Raddatz since 1999, issued a statement characterising the allegations that Obama's presence at her wedding proves she is biased as 'absurd'.

'Martha Raddatz is known for her tough, fair reporting, which is why it was no surprise to her colleagues inside and outside ABC News that she was chosen by the Commission on Presidential Debates for this assignment,' the statement said.

'Barack Obama was a law school classmate of Raddatz's ex-husband Julius Genachowski at Harvard. At the time Barack Obama was a student and president of the Law Review.

'He attended their wedding over two decades ago along with nearly the entire Law Review, many of whom went on to successful careers including some in the Bush administration. Raddatz and Mr Genachowski divorced in 1997 and both are now remarried.'
