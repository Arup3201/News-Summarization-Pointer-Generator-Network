Pensioners and middle-class workers are being hit by taxes that discourage them from earning more, according to the Government’s champion for older workers.

Ros Altmann, the former director general of Saga, branded the inheritance tax, 40p tax rate and increased stamp duty ‘draconian and penal’ because they were stinging those who did not consider themselves ‘remotely wealthy’.

‘After all that we’ve been through it would be wise from a social perspective to recognise that people deserve a break,’ she said. ‘

Hard times: Pensioners and middle-class workers are being hit by taxes that discourage them from earning more, according to the Government's champion for older workers

'The ordinary people who work hard and try to get on and live a good life deserve to get something back. These taxes are hitting people and their families who are not in any way even close to being rich,' Miss Altmann said.

‘I would like to see a proper overhaul of the tax system and a detailed study of how we can make it fairer,’ she told the Daily Telegraph.

Savings: One in ten people will pay inheritance tax by 2018, compared with one in 20 this year

Economist and consumer champion Mrs Altmann was appointed Business Champion for Older Workers by the Government last month.

The number of Britons paying inheritance tax is expected to rise by more than a third this year and double over the next five years.

Critics say this is unfair because it taxes assets such as homes which are typically bought with income that has already been taxed.

Mrs Altmann urged the Government to give pensioners a break and reward them for working hard.

She said inheritance tax ‘was supposed to be a tax on the very rich, but it is now hitting anyone in the South-East who has a house’.

She added: ‘It is a disincentive to build up savings or assets in later life if you worry you are going to lose nearly half of it in tax. Anybody who has a house is likely to risk losing 40 per cent of its value to the taxman.’ 

One in ten people will pay inheritance tax by 2018, compared with one in 20 this year.
