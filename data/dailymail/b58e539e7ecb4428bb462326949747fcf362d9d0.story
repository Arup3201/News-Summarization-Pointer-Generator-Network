When class favourite Roger the goldfish appeared to have a tumour, staff at the school feared there was only one likely outcome. 

However the seven-year-old fish has now made medical history after he became the first in Britain to receive microsurgery to remove the growth. 

Roger has now made a full recovery and is back with pupils at Mont Nicolle primary school in St Brelade, Jersey. 

George the goldfish became the first in Britain to have a lump removed by a vet in Jersey using microsurgery 

Teachers at the school feared Roger had developed cancer and took him to veterinary surgeon Jeremy Miller. 

Mr Miller had seen a similar, world-first procedure earlier this year on an Australian goldfish called George and offered to repeat the treatment.

He cut out the lump using intricate micro-surgery and the procedure went so well, the vet has offered to repeat the treatment. 

The pet fish was sedated by infusing his tank with anaesthetic before he was removed and placed on a plastic tray with a pipe flowing into his mouth to monitor his tiny heart.

Jeremy Miller performed the pioneering surgery on Roger the goldfish at All Pets Veterinary Centre in Jersey 

Mr Miller said Roger started swimming round the tank and eating minutes after the surgery was completed 

Mr Miller, did the work for free at Jersey's All Pets Veterinary Centre, and said the biggest concern was getting Roger to go to sleep as they were concerned about giving him too much anaesthetic. 

He said once the fish was unconscious they sprinkled water on his mouth and gills while he got to work removing the tumour. 

He said: 'We did not know how serious the tumour was or whether it was benign. But it may have grown and got close to his eye.

'It was a bit terrifying but I made it clear that if the operation did no go to plan we might lose him, but we decided the risk was worth taking.

Dr Tristan Rich, head of exotics and wildlife medicine at Lort Smith Animal Hospital in Australia performed the world-first surgery on George the goldfish in September that inspired Roger's groundbreaking procedure 

'We did something called an electro cautery. Basically, we have a small wire attached to something like a pen that cuts and coagulates the flesh at the same time so it stops the bleeding.

'We had Roger lying in a plastic dish attached to small probe called a Doppler probe that monitored his heart rate.

'The whole operation only took about five minutes but it took about 45 minutes to get him to sleep. 

'I was so delighted when I saw him coming round, I did give a little fist pump.'

Electrocautery involves using heat from a metal probe, conducted by an electric current. 

This allows the cutting through of soft tissue and is known as diathermy.

At the same time the heat seals, or cauterises the cut, preventing bleeding. 

Electrocautery was used for the first time on goldfish Roger in Australia in September this year. 

Electrocautery is routinely used on humans and is seen as a safer alternative to chemical cautery. 

It is often used to stop bleeding after an injury or during surgery . 

Mr Miller said once the surgery was completed Roger woke up around five minutes later and was swimming round the tank and eating.  

The surgery had been arranged for half-term to give staff at Mont Nicolle primary school in St Brelade, Jersey, the chance to break the news sensitively if it failed.

Roger was named after tennis star roger Federer and previously shared his tank with a another goldfish named Rafa - after Rafael Nadal.

Roger's tumour developed over the summer holidays after Rafa died and teacher Sarah Anderson thinks it may have been caused by the trauma of losing his companion.

Sarah said: 'It seems strange that Rafa died in June and almost immediately the tumour began to grow. 

'It was growing rapidly and within a couple of weeks it became very noticeable.

'The kids love him and the first thing they asked when they got back after half-term was 'is Roger OK?'

'We were a bit worried about how they would react if it did not go well, which is why we waited until half-term.

'The children have written about Roger and painted him and will be now writing letters to thank those involved, and the children want to interview Jeremy to ask him questions about what he did.

'He got back on Wednesday and the children are ecstatic.'

A biopsy of the tumour has since confirmed it was benign, but it could have grown causing him to go blind had it not been removed.
