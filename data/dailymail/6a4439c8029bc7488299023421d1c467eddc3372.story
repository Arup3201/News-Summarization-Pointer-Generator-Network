The nationwide Christmas shopping spree has renewed fears of an alarming increase in personal debt as Britons get carried out with the euphoria of bargain hunting.

Debt advice organisations are today bracing themselves for a huge upsurge in consumers admitting to money problems after drastically overspending their festive budget.

Some £2.5billion passed through the tills yesterday on top of an estimated £1.8billion on Boxing Day. Retail analysts believe the combined final total will be the highest ever spend for December 26 and December 27.

No end in sight: Some £2.5billion passed through tills yesterday on top of an estimated £1.8billion on Boxing Day

Financial analysts today warned that the Christmas buying experience can easily get out of hand as people spend huge sums of money.

Over 60 per cent of people are struggling to pay for Christmas this year and over a quarter will end up with debts because of Christmas spending, according to uSwitch.com.

On average the festive financial hangover will last almost 6 months as people strive to pay off their Christmas bills, but almost one in ten will still be clearing their debts next Christmas.

In order to put presents under the tree and food on the table, more than half will dip into their savings while over a third of savvy consumers will use up hard-earned shopping vouchers or reward points.

Of particular concern though is that over 40 per cent will have Christmas on credit this year, with 4 per cent taking out new credit especially to fund Christmas.

A further 16 per cent will sell possessions in order to get the Christmas cash they need and 3 per cent will borrow from friends and family (although with personal finances under pressure, many friends will not be in a position to lend money even if they want to).

Michael Ossei, personal finance expert at uSwitch.com, said: 'If you're struggling with your festive finances, and are thinking of turning to credit, I would urge you to use credit cards sensibly.

'Putting your spending on a card with 0 per cent on purchases could give you some breathing space. '

But the mass spending has been greeted with gloom by debt experts who fear that many people have gone back on their pledge not to use their credit cards to snap up sales bargains.

There are growing concerns that large numbers of Britons will go into 2012 burdened by mountains of extra debts that they have no realistic chance of repaying.

Not only are some risking being in debt next Christmas, they are still in debt from last Christmas.

Cash-strapped shoppers will slash nearly £1billion from spending on non-essential goods such as electrical items, furniture and carpets next year.

Retail sales are expected to grow by just 1.2 per cent to £295.3billion in 2012 - their third slowest year of growth in the past four decades - spelling more pain for the sector, according to a report by leading retail research firm Verdict.

Sales of groceries will grow by 3.3 per cent as consumers eat more meals at home to save money, but spending on non-food items is set to shrink by about 0.5 per cent as the change in attitudes - from extravagant to austere - continues.

That would mean retail non-food sales will have fallen by £9.5billion since the recession of 2008.

Electricals, furniture, floor 
coverings, DIY and gardening goods will be hardest hit, with sales down 
by about £900million, and are unlikely to improve until mid-2013.

Clothing
and footwear will grow by just 2.4 per cent, or £14 extra per person, 
as a result of higher prices, but the rise in youth unemployment will 
hit fashion retailers.

The report, compiled in conjunction 
with business analysis firm SAS, will add to fears that major retailers 
are in danger of collapsing in coming weeks amid unprecedented levels of
price reductions.

Among the most vulnerable are lingerie chain La Senza, Blacks Leisure and Millets.

Stores
across the country saw scenes reminiscent of those before the economic 
downturn as thousands of people flocked to the sales.

They were taking an average of at least £4.6million a minute, or £77,000 a second.

Experts
said the predicted £10billion plus spend for the whole of this week 
will be 2011's most lucrative for retailers, beating the pre-Christmas 
rush. Consumers are expected to have spent at least £22.8billion by the 
third week of January - £338million more than in the equivalent 
post-Christmas period last year.

Anita
Manan, an analyst at Experian, said: 'It's good to see so many people 
visiting stores and the milder weather has helped. With retailers' 
quarterly rent due, the difficulty is that they are selling a lot of 
stock at very low prices.

'What remains to be seen is if this quarter's takings are enough to see them through this difficult period to the next quarter.'

The
peak weeks of Christmas trading are crucial to retailers as this period
accounts for nearly one-fifth of the UK retail industry's annual sales,
making stores fight harder than ever to tempt shoppers through their 
doors.

The beleaguered 
retail sector has suffered from poor footfall figures during the course 
of the year. High street takings were down by around £200million a week 
in November versus October.

Many retail managers have complained once-thriving shopping centres have come to resemble ghost towns.

Shoppers crowd the Harrods doorway yesterday morning as the London store opened its Christmas sale

Bargain hunters: Shoppers at the Harrods winter sale search for big discounts

Christmas
sales were brought forward in many stores with discounts increasing on a
daily basis. Many stores are now offering 70 per cent or more off 
items.

Tom Nathan, manager 
of London's Brent Cross shopping centre, said Boxing Day had been the 
busiest ever – following on from a record breaking December 23 and 
Christmas Eve.

He said: 'We 
have broken three records in three days in terms of numbers, with each 
of the last three days being the biggest ever for the time of year.'

Industry
insiders, however, say that despite the encouraging trading, some 
big-name players may not make it through the next few weeks, with many 
now due to pay their rent bills for the next quarter.

La Senza, which has 146 stores and 18 concessions in the UK, has announced it plans to enter administration in coming days.

And
Blacks Leisure, which owns 98 Blacks outlets and 208 Millets stores, 
has fuelled speculation that it would go into administration in a move 
that would allow rivals to cherry-pick its best assets.

People rummage through handbags at Harrods yesterday as thousands descended on the Knightsbridge department store

Last
week chocolate-maker Thorntons said annual profits would miss 
estimates, while music chain HMV said weak sales may cast 'significant 
doubt' on its future.

Up to 
12million shoppers – one in four of the population aged over ten – were 
thought to have crammed into high streets and malls yesterday.

John Lewis, Harrods and Ikea all joined the retail frenzy, launching in-store sales on top of those already started online.

High
shopper numbers and busy traffic were reported at centres across 
Britain, including Bluewater in Kent, the Trafford Centre in Manchester 
and the MetroCentre in Gateshead.

Professor
Joshua Bamfield, director of the Centre for Retail Research, said: 'I 
don't think we're stretching it to say the 26th and 27th of December 
combined have been the best ever, certainly if we include online sales. 
I'd have thought it could be a record two-day takings.

'People
have definitely been waiting for the sales. Many decided to play a 
waiting game with retailers in anticipation of deep sales cuts. Because 
of the way Christmas has fallen and the fact that many people have taken
the whole week off that has prompted a huge boost in spending.'
