The shamed son of Pink Floyd guitarist Dave Gilmour was ‘thoroughly intoxicated’ when he attacked the royal convoy during the student fees riots, a court heard yesterday.

Charlie Gilmour, 21, was seen swinging on the Union Flag at the Cenotaph just hours before he hurled a bin at a car escorting the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall.

The disgraced Cambridge University student also jumped on the bonnet of the car, which was carrying close protection officers, blocking the driver’s view of the Prince’s Rolls-Royce in front, it was claimed.

Kingston Crown Court heard 
details of the chaos as a 100-strong baying mob laid siege to the royals
 during the tuition fees protest in London on December 9 last year.

During the five-minute onslaught, the 
windows next to the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall were smashed and the 
car battered by rubbish bins, sticks, fists and paint.

Prosecutor Duncan Penny told how a 
royal protection officer sitting in the front seat of the Prince’s 
limousine reacted with shock on coming under attack after dismissing the
 crowd’s mood as merely ‘boisterous'.

Mr Penny said: ‘At first he thought the mood was merely boisterous with the crowd chanting and waving banners and flags.

‘But the inspector said people then 
started kicking and punching the vehicle, making obscene gestures and 
striking the car with sticks.

‘He said how one man stood in front 
of the vehicle with his arms raised, a person threw a large cardboard 
box into the carriageway forcing the car to veer and another man raised a
 large black bin to shoulder height and threw it at them.

‘The window next to the Prince of 
Wales shattered but remained in place but the window next to the Duchess
 of Cornwall was broken and almost completely open.

‘He estimates the vehicle was under 
attack for at least five minutes and was deeply concerned and was under 
extreme levels of pressure.’

Under attack: The Rolls-Royce of Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall was attacked during the protests

A constable sitting in the Jaguar 
following the Rolls-Royce pushed his car door open to fend off the 
attack, striking a number of protesters with the door, including 
Gilmour.

The yob responded by sitting on the car’s bonnet, causing the driver to brake suddenly.

The officer was later injured when a bottle was lobbed through the door, hitting him on the forehead.

The Jaguar was also covered in spit 
from the jeering crowds who chanted: ‘Off with their heads’, ‘Tory scum’
 and ‘Give us some money’.

In a third vehicle carrying members of the Royal household, the back window was smashed.

Prince Charles’ equerry, Major Will 
Mackinlay was ‘very concerned and fearful for the people in the vehicle 
and also concerned about how the police protection officers may react,’ the 
court heard.

Gilmour claims he was so high that he cannot recollect whether he threw a bin at the Royal protection officers’ car.

Minutes later he looted a mannequin’s 
leg after smashing his way into Topshop with other protesters causing 
£50,000 with of damage and terrifying customers and staff who needed 
counselling afterwards.

Yesterday the court were shown a 
series of video clips showing the pop star’s son at the heart of the 
demonstration earlier in the day around Parliament Square and later in 
Regent Street and Oxford Street.

He was pictured clutching a rock and threatened to ‘storm parliament’ during the violent clashes with police. 

The defendant squirmed in his seat as footage was shown of him confronting police lines, shouting: ‘Let them eat cake, they say.

‘We will not eat cake, we will eat fire and ice and destruction because we are angry, very f****** angry.’

In other clips, he is heard shouting: ‘They broke the moral law, we are going to break all the laws. Arson. Destroy.

‘We are not going to stand for it any f**king more, storm Parliament.’

Later the protester appeared unsteady
 on his feet, slurring his words in a BBC interview in which he 
attempted to hide the stolen mannequin’s leg under his jacket.

David Spens, QC, representing Gilmour 
said he was ‘thoroughly intoxicated’ and ‘didn’t remember’ throwing a bin, 
and had simply spent the day ‘playing the fool’.

He said: ‘There was a huge amount of 
playing to the cameras and attention seeking during the course of the 
afternoon and early evening.

‘Up until Topshop, the extent of his behaviour was playing the fool, acting up to the cameras and showing off.

‘The defendant has no recollection of throwing anything. The defence case is there is no reliable evidence showing he did so.’

But Judge Nicholas Price QC said: ‘It was more than intoxication.’

Yesterday, dressed in a designer grey
 suit and his hair newly cropped, Gilmour cut an altogether different 
figure than the long-haired lout seen on CCTV.

The defendant’s biological father is the poet and playwright Heathcote Williams.

His adoptive father David Gilmour and mother, writer and journalist Polly Samson, accompanied him to court.

Gilmour faces jail when he is sentenced today after pleading guilty to violent disorder.
