A Halfords lorry with the slogan 'We fit' on the back has got stuck under a 15ft railway bridge.

The articulated lorry with a 17ft trailer has been lodged under the bridge at Eden Park in Beckenham, Kent, for more than four hours, causing delays for road and rail users.

London Fire Brigade said crew members are working with police and other agencies to remove the truck and the road will remain closed until then.

Trains are not running over the bridge to Eden Park, West Wickham, and Hayes stations, and are terminating at Elmers End.

A London Fire Brigade spokesperson said: 'Thankfully the driver got out of the lorry unhurt. We're working with other agencies to safely remove the lorry from under the bridge. Trains from London Bridge to Hayes have been affected and are currently terminating at Elmers End.'

A Met Police spokeswoman said: 'We are still working on removing the lorry.'

Ian Price, 59, who lives nearby, said: 'I was pulling out of my drive at around 1.30pm and stopped to let the fire engine past.

'I decided to down to the bridge as it is just down the road, and see what was going on.

'I saw an unmarked police car at first with its lights flashing so I thought there could have been a collision, although on closer inspection it was clear what had happened.

'The driver couldn't have been going very fast as he came off a roundabout onto the bridge, although he was stuck a fair way in, meaning he didn't try and edge under it.

'You can see the lorry is tilted at an angle, it is clear that the driver has forgotten the height of it.

'I am sure it caused quite a bit of disruption to the railway as it is the only line to Hayes.

'Luckily nobody seemed to be hurt, but you couldn't define irony any better with the saying 'we fit' on the back of the lorry.'

A Halfords spokesman said: 'We’re relieved to report that no one was hurt in the incident involving one of our lorries in Beckenham today. 

'Clearly ‘We Didn’t Fit’ and we would like to apologise for any delays and inconvenience caused to road and train travellers. We will be working with the authorities to carry out a full investigation.'
