England qualified for the 2015 European Under 21 Championship with an impressive 4-2 aggregate victory over Croatia - yet an astonishing eight players who did not feature in the second leg of that tie would makeSportsmail's strongest Three Lions XI.

Stoke City goalkeeper Jack Butland started in goal, with Manchester United's Luke Shaw and West Bromwich Albion striker Saido Berahino up front for Gareth Southgate's men but there are eight eligible players who did not feature in Vinkovci who could start in the Czech Republic next June.

Liverpool's Raheem Sterling, Everton's Ross Barkley and Arsenal's Jack Wilshere would be the star names in the England XI of players eligible for the tournament.

Sportsmail's strongest England Under-21 XI

Wilshere will be 23 by the time of the tournament but is eligible to play for the Under 21 side as he was born after January 1, 1992.

Any player who was born on or after this date is able to participate in the tournament because they were aged 21 or under when the qualification process began. 

Interestingly, Tuesday's goalscorers in England's 2-1 second-leg victory - Leicester City defender Liam Moore and Derby County's Will Hughes - would not feature in the side.

With Butland in goal, the defence would be comprised of  Shaw at left back and United's Phil Jones at right back - with Arsenal's Calum Chambers partnering Everton's John Stones at centre back.

A holding midfield duo of Wilshere and Southampton's James Ward-Prowse would help control the middle of the park.

They would be able to set the platform for England's exciting attacking midfield trio of Sterling, Barkley and Arsenal's Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain to provide the flair and pace.

Berahino - one of only three survivors from Tuesday night in Sportsmail's team - would then be given the task of firing England through the group stages and to European glory.

Goalkeeper: Jack Butland (Stoke City).

Defence: Eric Dier (Tottenham Hotspur), Liam Moore (Leicester City), Ben Gibson (Middlesbrough), Luke Shaw (Manchester United).

Players born on or after January 1, 1992 are eligible to participate in the 2015 European Under-21 Championship.

This means that some players - such as Jack Wilshere - will be 23 by the time of the tournament.

Yet these players are allowed to play because they were aged 21 or under when the qualification process began.

If England played their strongest XI, not only would they stand a good chance of winning the tournament next year - but also of progressing in the future.

Of the Germany U21 starting XI who beat England U21s 4-0 in the 2009 Euros final, five went on to lift the 2014 World Cup in Brazil.

Manuel Neuer, Benedikt Howedes, Jerome Boateng, Sami Khedira and Mesut Ozil all started in Holland on June 29, 2009. 

Encouragingly, England U21 boss Southgate refused to rule out including some of the star youngsters in his squad for the tournament, meaning this XI could become a reality rather than a mere fantasy.

Leicester City's Liam Moore scored one of England's two goals on Tuesday but he would not make the side 

Germany U21s beat England U21s 4-0 in the 2009 European Championship final in Holland.

Of the Germany side who started that day, five went on to lift the 2014 World Cup in Brazil.

GERMANY-U21 XI vs England U21 (June 29, 2009 - players in bold lifted the World Cup in 2014): Manuel Neuer; Andreas Beck, Benedikt Howedes, Jerome Boateng, Sebastien Boenisch; Mats Hummels; Fabian Johnson, Gonzalo Castro, Sami Khedira (c), Mesut Ozil; Sandro Wagner.

When asked if players such as Sterling or Chambers could play for his side, Southgate said: ‘I have been very careful throughout the (qualifying) campaign about who comes into the squad. They have to have a connection with the team and desire to come and play. I never worry about who I haven’t got and I’m not going to start now.

‘You can drive yourself to distraction. We could write a team sheet with illustrious names not involved here. The fact is, I believe we have such depth that we can challenge whoever we are playing with whatever players we put out on the pitch.

‘There may have been cases where some players haven’t fitted in to what we are doing. I certainly haven’t had a club pull out a player and thought, “That’s a bit off”. Managers and coaches at clubs have been really supportive - and I don’t think that will change.’
