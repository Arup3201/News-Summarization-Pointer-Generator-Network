The actor who plays Osama bin Laden in a new thriller has spoken about the difficult task of playing the former al-Qaeda leader.

Zero Dark Thirty has limited release on December 19 and the movie is hotly tipped to win several awards.

British actor Ricky Sekhon, 29, who describes himself as 'the least dangerous person I know', plays Bin Laden in the film that tells the story of 'the greatest manhunt in history' following the September 11 attacks.

Sekhon told the New York Post he was nervous about preparing for the role: 'There were a few sleepless nights, to say the least,' he said.

'I don’t 
care how much confidence you have, hearing news like that will really 
put the s**t into you if you’re planning on taking it seriously, which I
was,' Sekhon added.

The actor, who only has few minor credits to his name so far, was made to audition for the part without knowing what it involved. Sekhon only discovered he would be playing Bin Laden once he was successful.

Sekhon is six feet four and of Indian descent: 'I think I was asked about my height a few times, and that made me think, "OK, I’ll be playing a tall man or woman,"' he said.

But the actor wasn't under any illusions about the type of character he would be portraying.

Sekhon went on: 'I wasn’t fooling myself. My span of film castings have consisted of 
either terrorist, drug dealer, drug addict, heavy, henchman, large man, 
very tall man. I think it’s something to do with how I look.'

He told the Post he spent eight weeks preparing to portray the former al-Qaeda leader, reading books about terrorism, learning basic Arabic and slimming down.

Sekhon was made to sign a non-disclosure agreement with the filmmakers. 'But I told my mum, dad and my girlfriend, because they would see me doing strange things during my preparation,' he admitted.

Zero Dark Thirty comes out on limited release and full nationwide showings will begin on January 11. The film was nominated for four Golden Globe awards last week.
