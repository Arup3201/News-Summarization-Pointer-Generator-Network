A one-year-old baby died after being crushed by bricks outside his family home when his father reversed his pick-up truck into a wall.

Amaan Yaseen suffered serious head injuries after heavy bricks crumbled down on top of him as he played outside the semi-detached home in Stetchford, Birmingham, yesterday afternoon.

Witnesses said they saw the 19-month old lying in a pool of blood on the pavement after the crash and his distraught father stood over him 'crying his eyes out'. Despite the best efforts of paramedics, Amaan was pronounced dead at the scene.

Today, the family paid tribute to their 'lovely little boy' and said it was 'obviously a very difficult time'.

Speaking on their behalf, family friend Mohammed Hafeez said: 'His father was driving the vehicle. This was an accidental and tragic death.'

Floral tributes and teddy bears have been placed outside the family's home in the quiet residential suburb, which has been left stunned by the tragedy.

Speaking from outside the property today, Mr Hafeez read out a statement on behalf of the family which paid tribute to Amaan.

He said: 'At about 5pm last night, the Yaseen family suffered a tragic loss.

'A member of the family was parking a heavy goods vehicle when it collided with a wall and bricks fell onto Amaan Yaseen, who was only 19-months-old.

'Despite efforts to resuscitate him by paramedics, Amaan died at the scene.

'His parents are devastated and shocked. Amaan was a lovely little boy who brought a lot of joy and happiness to his entire family, especially his parents.

'He will be deeply missed.

'Amaan's family would like to thank West Midlands Ambulance service and West Midlands Police.

'It is very traumatic for Amaan's parents to have to go through.

'His father was driving the vehicle at the time. He is obviously and understandably very distraught and upset about it.

'This is obviously a very difficult time for the family. This was an accidental and tragic death.'

Roy Ives, 70, from Kitts Green, Birmingham, was walking home at about 4.50pm when he saw the incident. The carer described it as a 'scene of devastation'.

He said: 'It was horrendous. There was two big plots of bricks, one was 12ft high and a smaller one.

'I must have missed it by seconds.

'The driver had started to back up and hit the bricks because you could see the lorry was blocking the slip-road to the driveway. It was facing down the hill, so it must have reversed.

'I was only there for about 12 seconds. A helicopter landed on the park and ambulances came.

'But I could see he was gone.

'There was a pool of blood but not immediately beside his head so he must have been moved.

'He had his hands on his chest but I knew he had gone. 

'I didn't see it happen but the scene afterwards was awful. It was a scene of devastation. The poor baby was lying on the pavement.

'There were a lot of people around but I don't know who was the dad or mum.

'The driver looked to be Asian and in his 30s. I don't know if it was his father or not.

'It made me feel sick. I haven't eaten since. It has disturbed me that much. It is sad and very tragic.'

Amaan's parents have not yet been named but residents said the father was a taxi-driver who also owned a truck pick-up firm.

The couple are said to have lived at the £120,000 semi-detached property for about 10 years and have four children together.

Their next door neighbour Mary Mason, 67, added: 'The pick-up truck is there quite often so I think it belongs to the dad.

'I saw it reversing out my window and then it lurched forward and I heard a massive crash. I looked out and their garden wall had collapsed.

'Next thing I know I can just hear screaming and shouting, I don't know what was going on. There was chaos. I could just hear yelling and panicked screams.

'There were blue flashing lights everywhere but I had no idea what had happened, I thought the wall had just collapsed but the shouting and the noise made me think it could have been something worse.'

Another neighbour Glenys Cooper, 68, said: 'I went out after hearing a lot of commotion. There were sirens blaring.

'I spoke to one woman who was in a right state, she was really upset and she said it was her cousin who had been involved.

'But she couldn't get to anywhere near the scene really, the police soon had it all taped off. It's such a tragedy.

'I'm a grandmother and when you think it could have been one of your grandkids, you just can't imagine what the parents must be feeling.'

Several neighbours said they thought the owner of the truck was the boy's father, a taxi driver, who was seen 'crying his eyes out' after the crash. Dozens of flowers were left at the scene outside the property today

Another neighbour, who did not wish to be named, added: 'The dad was driving his van, it's there all the time and he obviously didn't see his son who must have been on the footpath.

'They have a pick-up truck and a taxi, he has a few jobs - he is a hardworking and decent man.

'He is always reversing it on and off the drive and tragically he has hit the wall which collapsed on his lad who was the other side.

'They have lived there about 10 years and have about four children. They are good people. They will be heartbroken.

'I looked out my window and could see the man crying his eyes out - he was a mess, he was really in a bad way.'

Grandmother-to-two Tracy Wilson, 50, added: 'I am really shocked.

'I won't drive past that part of the street for some time now. It has shocked me that much. I will drive the other way down the street just to avoid it.

'It is just horrid. I am a grandmother myself. It must be awful for the family. It is very very sad. I just feel sick.

'The family must be absolutely devastated.

'It is a close-knit community. There is a great feeling of sadness on this street.'

Another neighbour, who did not wish to be named, said: 'A truck hit a wall, which fell and squashed a baby.

'I am so shocked that the baby has died. It crushed the poor kid. It is just absolutely heart wrenching.'

Paramedics and an emergency doctor made desperate efforts to save Amaan and Northamptonshire Air Ambulance attended the scene (pictured). However, despite the attempts, the boy was pronounced dead

Barbara Porter, 76, added: 'I heard the helicopter land in Old Yardley Park over the road and there was police and ambulances everywhere.

'It's a really busy road and we've had loads of accidents down here. To know it is a little child is just heart-breaking.

'There's a lot of pedestrians as we are by a school and the cars are always bombing down the road. It's such a shame.

'It doesn't get more tragic than this. It's upsetting to think about what his family must be going through right now.'

West Midlands Police confirmed that Amaan's father was the driver of the truck and  said he is being supported by specially trained police officers.

Inspector Paul Bennett said: 'This is a very tragic set of circumstances – words cannot describe what his family are going through and our thoughts are with them at this time.

'Specialist officers will be supporting the boy's family and – as with all serious and fatal collisions - an investigation has been launched to establish the cause.'

A spokesman for West Midlands Ambulance Service added: 'A rapid response vehicle was on scene within four minutes of the call and was backed up by an ambulance, a paramedic officer, a BASICS Emergency Doctor and the Warwickshire and Northamptonshire Air Ambulance.

'The boy suffered a serious head injury.

'Ambulance staff carried out advanced life support but sadly nothing could be done to save him and he was confirmed dead at the scene by the doctor.'

Police are appealing for anyone who witnessed the crash to come forward.

Anyone with information about what happened should call police on 101 and ask for the Collision Investigation Unit quoting log 1637 16/3/2015.
