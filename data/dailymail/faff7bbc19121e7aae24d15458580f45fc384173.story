Spinning wind turbines might soon be confined to the recycling bin.

That's because German company Festo have revealed their innovative design for a new wind turbine that can operate even in low wing conditions.

Known as the DualWingGenerator, it uses 
two pairs of wings to generate power even when the wind speed drops to 
nine miles (14 km) per hour.

The product is part of Festo's Bionic Learning Network and mimics the natural beating of a bird's wings.

As one wing rises the other drops so that they help each other move even when the wind speed is low.

The shape of the wings means they generate lift when wind passes over them.

The motion of the wings is turned into electricity by an integrated circuit motor.

As one wing rises the other falls, so it can operate even in conditions when wind speed is low

But it's the effectiveness of the turbine to operate at low wind speeds that really makes it impressive.

It's possible that it could one day be used as an alternative to modern wind turbines.

Festo's DualWingGenerator is the first flapping turbine of its kind

The DualWingGenerator is an evolution of Festo's SmartBird.

The SmartBird's revolutionary design allows it to start, fly and land autonomously.

Its wings not only beat up and 
down, they also twist at specific angles, providing the ultra-light 
model with 'excellent aerodynamic qualities and extreme agility'.

Controlled by a radio handset, it can also simply glide through the skies if left to its own devices.

Steering is achieved when the SmartBird, which weighs just 450 grams, moves its tail and turns its head from side-to-side.

Inspired
 by the herring seagull, scientists at technology firm Festo control the
 up/down flapping motion of the wings by spinning two wheels inside the 
robot's torso.
