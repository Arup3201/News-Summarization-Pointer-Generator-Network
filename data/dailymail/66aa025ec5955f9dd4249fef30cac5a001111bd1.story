A pensioner with a terminal illness committed suicide after watching a TV programme about euthanasia by right-to-die campaigner and author Sir Terry Pratchett, an inquest heard.

Thomas Hobkinson, 71, suffered from motor neurone disease and had bought drugs over the internet so that he could kill himself at home.

It is believed the programme he watched was the controversial BBC documentary Choosing To Die which looked at the procedure of assisted death when it was broadcast in June of last year.

Last September the retired auditor's 
wife Anne discovered his body at their home in Falmouth, Cornwall, after
he had spent his last night watching their son Ben's wedding DVD.

He
had told his wife of his intentions and they had 'said their 
goodbyes'. He also reminded her where the instructions were for their 
home's heating system.

The 
inquest heard that after Mr Hobkinson was diagnosed in 2009 and the 
disease worsened, he informed family, friends, doctors and carers of his
intention to end his life.

Mrs
Hobkinson, 64, described her husband as 'courageous, strong-willed and 
determined'. She told the hearing in Truro: 'He had watched a television
programme by Terry Pratchett about euthanasia with people talking about
how to do it.'

Choosing To
Die, which filmed the 'assisted' death of motor neurone sufferer Peter 
Smedley, drew 900 formal complaints to the corporation by viewers 
questioning if the BBC was right to broadcast it.

Sir Terry, who has Alzheimer's disease, has been vocal in his campaigns to legalise assisted death in the UK.

By the time Mr Hobkinson died he was 
in a wheelchair and was having trouble swallowing and breathing. 
According to doctors he was approaching the end-stages of his disease.

He and his wife, who now lives in Plymouth, had two sons, Ashley, 38, and 28-year-old Ben, who married in August last year.

Mrs Hobkinson said that on the night of September 29 last year her husband told her he was ready to die.

'Tom said he was going to do it,' she told the inquest. 'He was watching a DVD of our son Ben's wedding.

'He told me to go to bed and to take one of his sleeping pills. We said our goodbyes.

'As I left the room he told me not to
forget the heating instructions for the flat were in the bottom drawer –
that was typical of him.'

She said she left her husband sitting in his wheelchair next to the living room table at around 10.45pm.

At around 3am she woke up and found 
him dead with a typed suicide note, signed and dated, which read: 'I 
have committed euthanasia by my own hand and without any assistance.' He
went on to say that if he was found alive he did not want to be 
resuscitated.

A post-mortem examination revealed he had overdosed on the drug he had bought.

Mrs Hobkinson added: 'I was hoping it wasn't going to work. But on the other hand it was what he wanted.'

Detective Constable David Palmer told 
the inquest that examination of Mr Hobkinson's laptop showed emails 
between himself and a Mexican contact who is thought to have supplied 
the medication he used to kill himself.

When coroner Dr Emma Carlyon asked if 
there had been any third party involvement, assistance or pressure 
exerted on Mr Hobkinson to kill himself, the officer replied: 
'Absolutely none whatsoever.'

Dr Carlyon recorded a verdict that Mr Hobkinson had killed himself.

After the inquest Mrs Hobkinson said: 
'Tom loved life and even though the disease was getting worse and worse 
he was happy right up until the end. We all love him very much and miss 
him.'

An amendment has been made to this article since publication after a representative of Sir Terry Pratchett contacted us.  He asks us to make clear that Mr Hobkinson watched Sir Terry's documentary over three months before committing suicide.
