House Speaker John Boehner says he's working to get out a two-part plan to raise the nation's $14.3trillion debt limit, but he can't say whether it will include Democratic support.

Boehner said that he hopes to have a bipartisan approach to solve the problem, but he's ready to move forward with a Republican plan if a deal couldn't be reached with President Obama today.

The speaker flatly rejects the White House insistence that the plan get the country through the next election instead of offering a short-term fix while a longer-term solution can be worked out.

He told Fox News Sunday it's
'not physically possible to do all of this in one step,' and said he 
was focused on a package that was 'doable at the 11th hour.'

'It may be pretty hard to put Humpty Dumpty together again,' he said.

Boehner's two-part deal includes a savings package first, followed by reforms to entitlement programs and the tax code.

He hopes for bipartisan support, but
said 'if that's not possible, I and my Republican colleagues in the 
House are prepared to move forward on our own... today.'

Boehner said he would develop a package 'within the principles of Cut, Cap and Balance.'

Meanwhile, as top lawmakers struggle today to 
hammer out a deficit deal, debt ceiling negotiators have unveiled a new 
solution to address how America can avert a catastrophic default and 
hold onto its prized credit rating - by creating a new Congress.

Tense negotiations: Boehner remains locked in debt limit negotiations with fellow congressional leaders and President Barack Obama

A
new 'Super Congress' or 'super-committee', comprised of members of both
chambers and both parties, is part of a new plan proposed by Senate 
Majority Leader Harry Reid and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell.

The
proposal includes an unprecedented formation of a 12-member panel of lawmakers, in addition to legislation to lift the $14.3trillion debt ceiling.

Legislation approved by the 
proposed committee is intended to move quickly through both chambers and
could not be amended by lawmakers by casting an up or down vote, 
reports the Huffington Post.

The panel would thus be 'less 
accountable than the system that exists today, and would find it easier 
to strip the public of popular benefits,' the report suggests.

Lawmakers are scrambling to 
assure investors before Asian markets open on Monday that America can 
avert a catastrophic default which would have devastating effects on the
global economy.

Congressional staff planned to 
work through the night after President Barack Obama told lawmakers in an
emergency White House meeting to find a way to lift the $14.3 trillion 
limit on U.S. borrowing that would allow the world's largest economy to 
pay its bills past next year's November election.

House Speaker John Boehner has 
made a Super Congress a central part of his last-minute proposal, 
multiple news reports and people familiar with his plan say.

But new acrimony flared late 
Saturday on Capitol Hill over that timetable, adding to the difficulties
facing negotiators who have been at impasse for weeks over the role of 
taxes in any deficit reduction plan.

An aide to Republican leaders said 
lawmakers were working on a plan for $3trillion to $4trillion in savings
over ten years, but another high-ranking Republican official said no 
numbers had been set.

It was not clear if this package contained additional tax revenue alongside cuts in government spending, as Obama has demanded.

Republican
leaders want 'to show progress' by 4pm ET on Sunday, before financial 
market trading gets under way in Asia, and have legislation to unveil 
Monday.

'Congressional 
leaders are working in good faith with the goal of having something to 
present to their members on Monday,' a second Republican aide said.

The
U.S. will run out of funds to service its debt on August 2 if Congress 
does not approve additional borrowing. Republicans have insisted the 
White House agree to deep spending cuts for long-term deficit reduction 
before they approve any increase in America's debt burden.

Negotiations
toward that agreement have whipsawed for weeks, finally hitting a brick
wall over taxes, one of the most ideologically divisive issues in U.S. 
politics.

A Democratic aide said Republicans were pushing a package that raised the debt limit and cut spending in two steps, while Democrats want a single deal to cover borrowing through 2012.

Michael Steel, a spokesman for House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner, the top Republican in Congress, said that 'a two-step process is inevitable.'

Disagreement on that issue prompted 
Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid to express new disappointment with 
the process, saying Republican 'intransigence' was 'pushing us to the 
brink of a default.'

Treasury
Secretary Timothy Geithner and White House chief of staff Bill Daley 
were scheduled to speak on several Sunday television news shows to 
hammer home Obama's argument that a deal must include more revenue from 
taxes.

Head to head: President Obama and U.S. Speaker of the House John Boehner meet again with top lawmakers on Saturday to revive debt talks in a bid to avert an August 2 default

The frantic drive toward a deal over the weekend began after closed-door talks between Obama and Boehner collapsed on Friday.

Those talks broke down as Republican leaders balked at a White House plan to raise revenues by $3.5trillion to $4trillion over ten years, complaining it contained $400billion more in additional tax revenue than they could stomach.

Obama, angry at the collapse of negotiations, chided Republicans and warned time had run out to lift the debt limit. The White House kept up the pressure on Saturday, urging Congress not to play 'reckless political games' and warning against stop-gap measures that fail to tackle the deficit.

Boehner must overcome stout resistance from Tea Party movement conservatives in his own party, who adamantly oppose any steps to raise tax revenue.

Rating agencies say they will cut America's Triple-A credit rating if the U.S. fails to meet debt payments, likely triggering global market turmoil. Even if the U.S. does not default, its rating will be under pressure if Congress fails to tackle long-term deficit reduction.

Financial markets are growing more edgy and U.S. banks and businesses are making contingency plans for the possibility of a debt default that would drive up interest rates, sink the dollar and ripple through economies around the world.

Mohamed El-Erian, co-chief investment officer at Pacific Investment Management Co, said: 'We continue this weekend to monitor very closely the negotiations in Washington, with frequent updates and assessments. We are also evaluating reactions outside the United States.'

A breakdown in Washington, he feared, 'will be highly detrimental to the already fragile health of both the U.S. and global economies.'

Lawmakers have scrambled despite the new wrinkle to show progress just before Asian markets kick off their trading week.

Lawmakers also were mindful of what could happen in financial markets if a deal is not quickly reached.

Republican Representative Charles Dent said: 'I am concerned that there might be an adverse reaction in the markets.'

Dent also said Boehner told members a default was not an option and lawmakers have to come to agreement.

A Republican congressional aide said: 'We need to have something posted online by Monday.'

In the White House meeting, Obama warned lawmakers not to pursue a short-term extension of the debt limit.

White House spokesman Jay Carney said after the talks: 'Congress should refrain from playing reckless political games with our economy. Instead, it should be responsible and do its job, avoiding default and cutting the deficit.'

A short-term extension of mere months could cause Wall Street credit agencies to strip America of its gold-plated triple-A rating and increase interest rates for American consumers, Obama told them.

Meanwhile, Republican presidential candidate Tim Pawlenty has fired off at Obama, accusing him of showing no courage in the debt showdown.

The former Minnesota governor told CNN: 'If you're the leader of the free world, would you please come to microphone and quit hiding in the basement about your proposals, and come on up and address the American people? Is he chicken?'

He said Obama needs to talk specifically and publicly about where he would cut entitlement programs to reduce the nation's debt.

'Where's the president of the United States on the most pressing financial challenges of our country on entitlement reform? Where is his specific Medicaid reform proposal? Where is his specific Medicare reform proposal? Where is his Social Security reform proposal?' Pawlenty asked.

'The answer is he doesn't have one. You can't find him publicly talking about that. He's ducking, he's bobbing, he's weaving. He's not leading, and that's not the kind of president we need, and that's why he needs to be removed from office.'

Pawlenty himself has been criticised for not being aggressive enough in his 2012 campaign.
