There were sightings of original Crazy Gangsters at Kingsmeadow, including former manager Dave Bassett, goalkeeper Dave Beasant, still affectionately known as 'Lurch', and Terry Gibson.

Lawrie Sanchez, scorer of Wimbledon’s most famous goal in the 1988 FA Cup final and on BBC duties on Monday night, was applauded around the pitch to his position.

Adam Lallana is expected to be ruled out for a month after scans confirmed he damaged a thigh muscle during Liverpool’s draw against Leicester at Anfield on New Year’s Day.

He has been slow to adjust since his £25million move from Southampton in the summer but Lallana had started recapture some of his best form and scored twice against Swansea last week. 

He will miss both legs of the Capital One Cup semi-final against Chelsea.

British Paralympian David Weir was also at the game. Weir trains in the athletics stadium behind Kingsmeadow with coach Jenny Archer, who is an AFC Wimbledon fan.

Neal Ardley met his wife Sarah when she worked as a receptionist in the sports centre now named in Weir’s honour, which was turned into a temporary home for the national media. 

Ardley was working on extra training at the time with Archer.

The rise and fall of the original Wimbledon has been played out in full since the third round draw was made last month but they are most proud of the recovery and no pre-match tune was greeted most warmly than ‘I Am The Resurrection’ by The Stone Roses. The rest of the playlist took fans back to the Eighties, when Wimbledon were climbing through the tiers to the top flight (and Liverpool won the title), with Depeche Mode and The Clash both featuring.

Brendan Rodgers was taking no risks at Kingsmeadow, picking a stronger team for the game against their League Two hosts than he did when Liverpool played reigning European champions Real Madrid at the Santiago Bernabeu in November. Liverpool’s star performer, Steven Gerrard, was one of the surprise exclusions from that starting XI in Spain, which included Fabio Borini, Joe Allen and Kolo Toure.
