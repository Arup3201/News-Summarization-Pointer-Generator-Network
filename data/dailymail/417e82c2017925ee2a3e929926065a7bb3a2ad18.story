Canadian Nick Taylor picked up his first win on the PGA Tour on Sunday as he won the Sanderson Farms Championship.

The 26-year-old from Winnipeg - in his first season on the Tour - finished two shots clear of the field in Jackson.

It is some achievement in just his 13th full-time start and he becomes the first man from his country win on the tour since Stephen Ames five years ago.

A final-round 66 helped him finish 16-under-par for the week and earns him a cheque of £450,000.

He was so untroubled that he could even afford a bogey on the par-four last, with a run of birdies from 13 to 15 having got him into a winning position.

'It's been a whirlwind of a summer; six months ago I was struggling,' Taylor told the PGA's official website.

'I'm shocked but I'm happy about it.

'I felt very comfortable, I had some nerves but I was able to make some putts.'

Boo Weekley and Jason Bohn came home tied for second after respective rounds of 66 and 69.

Overnight leader John Rollins finished fourth and will be left kicking himself, with the three shots between him and first avoidable.

He dropped three shots coming home on 12,14 and 18, losing his game when he needed it the most after a level front nine.

England's Greg Owen was the highest-placed European, ending nine shy of Taylor in a tie for 22nd.
