Cristiano Ronaldo has accepted he was wrong to have a night out to celebrate his birthday just hours after Real Madrid were thumped by rivals Atletico.

Ronaldo made his first appearance since suspension in the derby at the Vicente Calderon stadium, but the Ballon d'Or winner was well off the pace and was part of a side dismantled 4-0 by their rivals.

According to Spanish publication Marca the Portuguese attacker has apologised for his partying antics and has vowed to regain his best form in the coming games.

Ronaldo is keen to win back the respect of the Real Madrid players and fans as the 30-year-old, who has scored 38 goals this season, looks to Sergio Ramos for support.

The same publication also claim that Barcelona's move for Porto right back Danilo is heavily dependent on fellow Brazilian Neymar.

The duo are big friends and it may be up to Neymar to persuade the 23-year-old defender, who is out of contract in June 2016, to move to the La Liga giants.

Juventus star midfielder Paul Pogba has been warned by someone only too familiar that swapping Turin for a move to Real Madrid isn't always the best thing to do.

Brazilian midfielder Emerson moved to the Bernabeu Stadium for almost £12million in 2006, shortly after Juventus were relegated to Serie B, and went on to win the La Liga title.

But he played just 28 games for Los Blancos and returned to Serie A with AC Milan less than a year later.

French international Pogba has been heavily linked with a move to Real Madrid but Emerson thinks the former Manchester United should stay put.
