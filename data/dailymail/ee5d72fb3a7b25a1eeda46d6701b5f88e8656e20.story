The increased police presence and use of checkpoints is the police's reaction to both the recent bomb attack at Cairo University and the escalation of violence in pro-Morsi protests around the country

The attack came after fresh violence has been hitting the country, as many people engage in protests and demonstrations.

Much of the protests have been carried out by students loyal to the ousted Islamist President Mohammed Morsi, who was deposed by a military backed coup at the end of the Arab Spring last year.

Daily battles on university campuses are now a common occurrence, thanks to the increased levels of violence and protests.

Because of this, the Egyptian forces have had to up their security measures, and have begun tavelling in armoured cars more regularly, dressing in full riot gear, and setting up checkpoints in key areas.

There were two bombs that exploded outside Cairo University's main campus in a coordinated attack that killed two people, including a senior police officer - a brigadier general, and a civilian.

The two bombs were planted by the roadside near the faculty of engineering, and went off seconds apart.

According to security officials, the bombs seemed to have been targeting riot police who were routinely deployed at the university in anticipation of near-daily student protests supporting the Muslim Brotherhood.

Seven people were injured in the incident - four civilians and three senior police officers, including Maj. Gen. Abdel-Raouf El-Sirafy, who is the deputy chief of police in the Giza province, parts of which are located in the Greater Cairo area.Â

The attack was the latest by militants targeting security forces following Islamist president Mohamed Morsi's overthrow in July

Egyptian state TV said the bombs were crude and homemade.

The military-backed interim government has branded the Brotherhood a terrorist organization, alleging it has plotted violence since Morsi's removal.

The Brotherhood denies the claims, saying the labels of 'terrorist' are intended to give a legal veneer to the removal an elected president.
