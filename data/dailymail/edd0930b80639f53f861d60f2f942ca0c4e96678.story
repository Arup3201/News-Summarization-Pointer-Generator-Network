Amanda Knox and her former boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito are 'fearing the worst' as Italy's highest court prepares to decide their fate, according to their entourage.

Knox is waiting for the verdict in their final appeal for the murder of British student Meredith Kercher at home in Seattle, while her one-time lover is in Rome for the hearing at the city's imposing Supreme Court, nicknamed the Palazzaccio or 'Bad Palace'.

Sollecito could be seen arriving at court this morning with his current girlfriend Greta Menegaldo, before appearing deep in thought as he left this evening after the case was adjourned until Friday morning.

Knox's lawyer Carlo della Vedova described her client as 'very worried' about adding: 'She hasn't been sleeping much.'

Della Vedova also scotched rumours that the American had been trying to get pregnant to avoid possible extradition. 'That is absolutely false. She is not engaged either,' he said.

However, it has now been revealed Knox's lawyers have turned to the European Court of Human Rights in a last ditch attempt to stop the final ratification of her conviction for murder.

They have asked for the case to be suspended, pending the acceptance of her appeal to the European Court against a conviction for slander.

Knox claims that she was coerced by police into making false statements blaming the murder on bar owner Patrick Lumumba during interrogations of more than 40 hours in November 2007.

As the slander is considered circumstantial evidence in her murder trial, her legal team asked for the murder trial to be suspended, Knox defence lawyer Carlo Della Vedova confirmed.

But the move has left representatives of the Kercher family shocked. 

The Kercher's lawyer Vieri Fabiani said: ‘If the Strasbourg court condemns the Italian Republic, what would it change? What could it usefully serve? Absolutely nothing.’

Meanwhile, a consultant for Sollecito said that he had already said his goodbyes to his family and air hostess girlfriend Greta Menegaldo, who accompanied him to the packed courtroom this morning, where neither was able to find a seat.

The assistant said: 'It is as if he is not there anymore. He said goodbye to his family and Greta outside the court. He fears the worst.'

Knox and Sollecito served four years for the brutal murder of Leeds Student Miss Kercher in Perugia in 2007.

She was found half naked with multiple stab wounds to her body and a deep gash in her throat.

The pair were freed on appeal in 2011. But last year, they were sensationally reconvicted and ordered to serve 28 and 25 years respectively for the murder.

Now the Supreme Court can opt to confirm the convictions, in which case extradition proceedings would start against Knox.  Or if they find contradictions or illogicality in the guilty sentence they could send the trial back to appeal stage.

Sollecito has asked to have his case annulled on the basis that it should have been separated from that of Knox, as all the proof points to her.

One of the world's leading DNA experts, who has extensively investigated the murder of Meredith Kutcher, has claimed the forensic evidence against Amanda Knox and Raffaele Sollecito is 'incredulous' and 'made up' by prosecutors.'

Knox, 27, and Sollecito, 30,  stand accused of killing the British student in Perugia and the Italian Supreme Court is expected to either uphold or quash their convictions today.

Professor Peter Gill, a lecturer of Forensic Genetics at Oslo University, Norway, looked in-depth at the DNA results from the crime scene using the originally analysis by the Italian Police Scientific Department and also a second independent analysis ordered by the judge in the first appeal.

In an exclusive interview with the Daily Mail, Professor Gill admits that the evidence against Knox and Sollecito is very weak and and compares it to something out of the fictional CSI TV series.

He said: 'It's very, very tenuous to use this [DNA] evidence to link to the conclusion that it proves  an activity such as stabbing a victim. 

If Knoxs' conviction is upheld she could delay going to jail if she were pregnant, according to Italian legal experts.

There has also been speculation that political pressure from the US could hamper the extradition process.

Sollecito is reportedly seeking to separate his case from Knox's, with his lawyers pointing out that a partial confession written by the American and later retracted did not mention his presence at the scene of the crime. If that argument succeeds, the Italian could be given a new trial.

Since being convicted Sollecito has deserted Knox, his one-time lover, and is now insisting that their positions are 'not intertwined'.

His case should have been considered independently of Knox's, he now insists. 

Yesterday bombshell court papers revealed that Sollecito claims he does not remember whether Knox was with him at the time of Ms Kercher's murder.

In a dramatic change in legal strategy, Sollecito has cast serious doubt on Foxy Knoxy's alibi, with the Italian now saying he can't be sure she was at his house for the whole of the night on which the British student was brutally murdered.

All the evidence against the former couple points to Knox, Sollecito claims in papers filed by his lawyers in advance of the make-or-break Supreme Court hearing today.

Supporters of Amanda Knox are convinced that her guilty verdict for murder will be upheld by the Italian Supreme Court when they make their decision later this week.

American Amanda Knox and Italian Raffaele Sollecito both stand accused of killing British student Meredith Kercher and have been tried three times for the crime.

The last hearing, in January last year, again found them guilty.

Knox's legal team has been warned that this decision is likely to be rubber-stamped by the Supreme Court today.

People close to the case do not believe Ms Knox stands a chance in the hugely-divisive case. 

One supporter said they were prepared for  the 'greatest miscarriage of justice' that has ever happened to a US citizen.

In their previous two trials, Knox maintained that they were together at Sollecito's flat on the night of the murder after which Miss Kercher, 21, was found half-naked with her throat slit in the cottage she shared with Knox in Perugia, Italy.

In an A-Z of reasons for distancing his position from hers, Sollecito's lawyers are attempting to demonstrate that the evidence used against Knox does not concern him.

In the 306-page paper, Sollecito claims that his computer records prove he was watching the Japanese Manga cartoon Naruto at the time of the alleged murder.

But he is not sure whether Knox was at his house for the whole night as he had been smoking marijuana.

The document says: 'The defence intends to emphasise that Sollecito has always shown himself to be extraneous to the crime, and has always said that that night he did not move from his own home. However, he did not rule out that Knox could have gone out.'

The document also points out that Knox, unlike Sollecito, had an alleged motive for the murder.

The report explaining the motivation  refers to a statement that Rudy Guede made to police that Miss Kercher believed Knox stole €300 and two credits cards from her.

Ivory Coast-born Guede is serving a 16-year jail sentence for his involvement in Kercher's death after a separate trial. Judges ruled he did not act alone.

Sollecito, by contrast with Knox, 'had no reason to want the death of Meredith Kercher.'

The document states: 'The alleged motives [not getting along and the missing €300] concern only relations between the victim and Amanda Knox, not Sollecito.'
