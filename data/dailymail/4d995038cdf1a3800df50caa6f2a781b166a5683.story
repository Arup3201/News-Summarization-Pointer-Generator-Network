Intrusive new powers to spy on the last 12 months of everybody’s bank statements are being demanded by the taxman.

In a major escalation of its existing rights, Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs wants to be able to access monthly copies of bank, Isa and even joint account statements.

This would mean sensitive personal details such as the size of families’ monthly mortgage payments, how much they spend in restaurants and the amount saved into a tax-free nest egg are open to scrutiny.

Under the powers, HMRC would examine spending levels for a year before raiding accounts for unpaid tax

Last night, critics condemned the 
unprecedented power grab as ‘Big Brother’ tactics.

It is the latest 
twist in the furore over HMRC’s plans to take money directly from bank 
accounts to settle unpaid tax bills. 

At least 17,000 people a year will 
have funds seized under the proposed new powers.

But
 yesterday HMRC chief executive Lin Homer went further, telling MPs on 
the Treasury Select Committee she also wants to be able to ask banks or 
building societies to hand over 12 months of a person’s bank or Isa 
statements.

This is to check their income flow so officials can be sure the money will be there when they swoop on the account.

Ms Homer even suggested that if HMRC is given the power, a ‘debate will follow’ about extending it to other public bodies such as retrieving money owed for TV licences or car tax. 

But she told MPs she accepted there was a risk that HMRC could make mistakes when targeting someone’s finances.

Under the powers, HMRC would contact people who owe money up to nine times and if they fail to respond their bank account would be frozen for 14 days.

During this ‘cooling off period’, tax officials want to have access to a year’s worth of bank statements to assess whether the person can live on what money might be left if their taxes are taken from their account.

HMRC says it would leave £5,000 in accounts once the debts have been removed. 

Labour MP George Mudie said: ‘This is another intrusion into people’s lives. 'You are going to have the power to get 12 months’ bank accounts from people, building societies… the lot.’ 

HMRC chief executive Lin Homer insisted the powers were needed to target 17,000 'recalcitrant debtors' but Lib Dem MP John Thurso said it was a 'unique right to go against the Magna Carta charter'

The taxman fails to answer more than one in five phone calls.

MPs demanded ‘resignations on the table’ unless significant improvements were made.

HMRC admitted it would not be able to guarantee to answer 90 per cent of calls this year, as it brought in hundreds of extra staff to deal with peak periods.

According to latest figures, in 2013-14, the HMRC answered just 79 per cent of calls to its call centres.

Labour MP George Mudie said there must be improvements or there should be ‘resignations on the table’.

He raged: ‘It’s no use trying. Trying is not the word. Either do it or go, that’s quite straightforward. You are harming a tremendous amount of people.’

Ms Homer insisted ‘significant progress’ was being made, but would like it to be ‘much better’.

‘It is one of the most important things we are doing.’

Liberal
 Democrat John Thurso led a chorus of criticism of the move.

He said: 
‘We are talking here about the ability for one organisation of state... 
to have the unique right to go against the Magna Carta and all the other
 things we have established and to go in and seize – without judicial 
process or review – a bank account. 

'I just want to know if it is 
justified, because my sense is that Parliament is going to reject it.’ 

Mr Thurso said that HMRC was trying to become 'judge, jury and executioner' and to remove legal protections from those who it believes owe tax, simply because it was 'slow and expensive' to follow the legal processes.

He demanded to know whether the taxman would pay compensation in full if it removed money from people's bank accounts or ISAs in error and their house purchase fell through or they missed out on a windfall from rising share prices as a result.

But Ms Homer insisted: 'I don't think this is against Magna Carta. I don't think it is substantially different from the PAYE arrangement.

'This is not disputed tax, this is tax that is due, that people who are not subject to PAYE are choosing simply not to pay and they are creating an environment within which the normally very low collection cost of tax is made substantially higher by their action, in a way which in the vast majority of cases is wilful.

'I believe that for the taxpayer as a whole, it is right that we have sufficient powers to stop these limited numbers of people avoiding paying tax.'

More than 90 per cent of people pay their taxes, but a minority take the view that they will delay paying for as long as they can get away with it, said Ms Homer.

'We are talking about 17,000 people who don't dispute the tax is due, they just don't pay,' she said. 'We will have written to them, we will have engaged with them and they just fold their arms and wait for us to take some other action.

'Of course, we can go to court, but the cost both in time and money of going to court will often outweigh or seriously diminish the amount of tax collected. In these cases, we believe with proper safeguards... this is a fairer way of extracting the tax everybody is due to pay.' 

The plan to take money directly from people’s bank accounts was announced in the Budget.

But
 the proposal to scrutinise statements emerged only  yesterday when HMRC
 officials were questioned by MPs on the Treasury Select Committee.

At present, the taxman is only allowed to know how much interest you have received from your bank accounts.

Last
 night, an HMRC spokesman insisted the new information it is demanding 
would not be used for ‘any purposes other than the direct recovery of 
debts’.

He said: ‘We would immediately destroy the information once DRD [direct recovery of debts] has  been applied.’

Warning: David Beckham

Celebrities such as David Beckham, the Centrica boss Sam Laidlaw and around 1,300 other people have been warned to prepare for tax demands of more than £520million.

They have been caught up in a £7billion crackdown by the Treasury that forces people to immediately pay disputed tax bills if they have used an alleged tax-avoidance scheme.

Beckham, Mr Laidlaw and other investors are, or have been, clients of Ingenious Media, an investment company that financed films.

The firm says it is ‘fundamentally unjust’ to demand payment for tax bills before a tribunal, due to begin in November, takes place.

'THIS GOES AGAINST THE MAGNA CARTA'

HMRC’s new powers will ‘go against the Magna Carta’ by allowing it to seize money without needing the permission of the courts, an MP said yesterday.

In the Magna Carta, which will celebrate its 800th anniversary next year, Article 39 states: ‘No free man shall be seized or imprisoned or stripped of his rights or possessions… nor will we proceed with force against him or send other to do so except by the lawful judgment of his equals, or by the law of land.’

Lord Thurso, a LibDem MP, said: ‘We are talking here about the ability for one organisation of state to go against the Magna Carta and seize – without judicial process – a bank account.’

HMRC
 says it wants to look at the bank statements in order to make sure that
 a person will not suffer hardship after the money is removed to pay the
 tax debt.

It has promised 
all those targeted will be left with a minimum of £5,000 across their 
accounts after the tax debt has been paid. It will also not seek to 
‘create or increase overdrafts’.

Mrs
 Homer told MPs that the people who will be targeted by the new 
money-grabbing powers can afford to pay their tax, but simply refuse. 
‘They don’t dispute that the tax is due,’ she said.

‘They just won’t pay. They just fold their arms and wait for us to take some other action.’

But
 Chas Roy-Chowdhury, head of taxation at the Association of Chartered 
Certified Accountants, said: ‘There is a dangerous sense of “Big 
Brother” about it.

'There is a fear that this will set a precedent for 
HMRC and other government agencies [such as the collection of unpaid 
council tax].

‘This is a dangerous route to begin to go down.

‘These
 powers, if implemented, will affect families and individuals, as well 
as small businesses, up and down the country and not large 
multi-national businesses with armies of lawyers and accountants on hand
 to prevent it happening.’

HMRC’s
 consultation document says revealing bank or Isa statements would 
‘strike a sensible balance’ between ensuring it has accurate information
 and maintaining the debtor’s privacy.

But Lord Thurso added: ‘HMRC is asking to become judge, jury and executioner on this.

‘Is
 it not very concerning that we are removing from the process that 
currently exists the legal process simply because it is slow and 
expensive?’
