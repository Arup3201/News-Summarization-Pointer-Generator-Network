David Cameron has intervened in the UK’s biggest ever takeover, warning he is 'determined' to protect British jobs as US drugs giant Pfizer stepped up its bid for AstraZeneca.

Viagra maker Pfizer said it hoped the new offer of £50 a share – up 7 per cent on a bid in January – would speed up a move towards a ‘combination’ between the two drugs firms, but UK-based AstraZeneca rejected the move.

The Prime Minister revealed he had sought 'assurances' from Pfizer about protecting jobs, and insisted he would not allow an 'abject surrender' of a British firm.

Viagra maker Pfizer stepped up its bid for British firm AstraZeneca, which employs more than 50,000 people around the world, including 6,700 in the UK

The proposed deal would is being driven by Pfizer’s desire to get its hands on Astra’s cancer unit, make cost savings and gain a foot in Britain to reduce its tax bills.

Government sources point to George Osborne’s decision to cut corporation tax to 21 per cent this year – one of the lowest among leading economises – as one of the key reasons Pfizer wants to move some operations to the UK.

In a letter to Prime Minister David Cameron, Pfizer said it was committed to building Astra's planned research and development (R&D) hub in Cambridge and that 20 per cent of the combined company's research and development workforce will be in the UK.

Mr Cameron spoke to AstraZeneca chairman, Leif Johansson, hot long after the firm rejected Pfizer's increased offer.

Speaking at a Tory election campaign event in north Staffordshire, Mr Cameron said the Government had received 'robust' assurances from Pfizer.

He said: 'My priority is absolutely clear - British jobs, British science, British inventiveness, British research and development. We are seeing a revival in those things and I want to see that go further.

Downing Street revealed David Cameron has personally spoken to the head of AstraZeneca to highlight his 'determination' to protect British jobs

'My job is to protect the United Kingdom's interests. I want to see great jobs in these industries here in Britain.

'That is why we have sought and received robust assurances from Pfizer were a deal to go ahead.

'But
 it is not for us to endorse any deal, it is for us - the British 
Government, the British Prime Minister - to fight hard for Britain's 
interests and deliver Britain's interests.

'That is exactly what I will do. I will not make the mistakes of some previous governments.

'Outright
 hostility, abject surrender - that's what you have seen in the past. 
What I am interested in is results for Britain and that's exactly what 
you will see from our stance over this issue.'

Officially the government does not have a
 formal role in the deal, but Mr Osborne, Business Secretary Vince Cable
 and Science Minister David Willetts have also been in regular contact with 
the heads of both firms to press the need to protect British jobs and 
skills.

Chief executive Ian 
Read said in the letter making the increased offer: ‘We believe the 
industrial logic for a combination between Pfizer and AstraZeneca is 
compelling.’

He said the deal would bring together ‘powerful and world-leading’ research expertise in key areas such as cancer, inflammation, and cardiovascular and metabolic disorders.

Mr Read said the takeover would create a ‘golden triangle’ of medical expertise in Oxford, Cambridge and London.

Today Mr Willetts insisted he was pushing Pfizer in a 'very hard-nosed way' to protect jobs here.

He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'This is ultimately going to be a decision for AstraZeneca shareholders.

'We are pressing Pfizer in a very hard-nosed way. Their letter has a set of proposals for research and development and manufacturing in the UK that have moved a long way from where they were a week ago.'

Us drugs giant Pfizer has cited Britain's lower tax regime for wanting to move operations to the UK

But Labour's shadow business secretary
 Chuka Umunna warned Pfizer has a history for asset stripping in 
previous takeovers., and this deal is being driven by wanting to take 
advantage of lower tax rates in the UK.

'I've not spoken to anyone in the sector who has anything but grave reservations,' he told BBC Radio 4.

Astra
 employs more than 50,000 people around the world, including 6,700 in 
the UK, but numbers are being reduced as it shifts its headquarters to 
Cambridge, closing a research centre in Cheshire and offices in London.

Pfizer
 employs more than 70,000 people around the world, including 2,500 in 
the UK, with 900 at its regional headquarters in Surrey.

The
 development came as Lord Heseltine, the former Tory Deputy Prime 
Minister, voiced concern about the absence of a role for the government 
in approving major takeovers.

Lord Heseltine. former Tory Deputy Prime Minister, voiced concern that the government did not have power to intervene in big takeovers while Labour's shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna said the pharmaceutical sector has 'grave reservations' about the deal

The Conservative peer, who is an adviser to Prime Minister David Cameron on economic growth, said takeovers ‘could be very helpful’, but argued that Britain should do more to protect key national interests, such as the science base.

He said ministers should have ‘reserve powers’ to protect British companies when crucial interests are at stake.

‘Foreign takeovers can often be hugely helpful and I have no doctrinal preoccupations - I've done enough takeovers of small businesses myself to know how valuable they can be,’ Lord Heseltine told the BBC.

‘But the important point is that every other advanced economy has mechanisms of some sort on a failsafe basis to scrutinise foreign takeovers and we're the only country that doesn't.

;I think that is a mistake and I think there are so many issues about the science base, about supply chains, about employment prospects that ought to be explored.

‘I don't see any way in which this can be adequately done unless the Government has reserve powers.

‘It's a question of where their headquarters are, where the decisions are taken, who determines what research is done and where, how much government money goes into supporting the science base within a co-operative arrangement, where the supply chains are going to be and what the motive is.’
