Andy Murray arrived in Perth on Sunday evening as the British No 1 gears up for the start of the Australian Open later this month.

Less than 24 hours after winning the Mubadala World Tennis Championships in Abu Dhabi following the withdrawal of Novak Djokovic, Murray landed in the Western Australia capital ahead of his first match at the Hopman Cup team event on Monday.

Murray is representing Great Britain alongside Heather Watson, with the pair taking on France's Benoit Paire and Alize Cornet in their first Group B match.

After experiencing pain in his left shoulder following a straight-sets win against Rafael Nadal on Friday, Murray has said he should be fit to play in Perth, which will be his last event before the Australian Open gets underway on January 19.

The 27-year-old had an ultrasound scan on his shoulder in Abu Dhabi on Saturday morning which showed there to be no serious damage to worry about.

Speaking before leaving the United Arab Emirates, Murray said: 'I had an ultrasound scan on it and the results of that were clear and very positive so that was good.

'Hopefully in a few days with some more rest and more treatment it will be absolutely fine when I get to Australia.'

Murray received some more good news after arriving in Perth as brother Jamie and Australian partner John Peers beat top seeds Jean-Julien Rojer and Horia Tecau 6-3, 6-4 in the first round of the Brisbane International on Sunday night.
