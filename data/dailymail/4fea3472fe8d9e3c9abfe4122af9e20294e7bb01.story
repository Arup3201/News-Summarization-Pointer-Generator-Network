 A drunken thug who dangled his girlfriend over a major road bridge continued to harass her from behind bars.

Adam Scott was jailed for the terrifying incident when he threatened to drop her on to a main road over the pedestrian bridge.

But within days he sent letters to his girlfriend from behind bars breaching a restraining order which banned him from any contact with her for life.

A court heard the letters were meant to be loving but a judge said one of them threatened the young woman’s new partner by ‘stabbing him in the face’.

Scott, 21, was given a suspended jail term after he admitted three breaches of a life long restraining order against his ex lover.

But the judge warned him that he will lock him if he makes any contact with his ex-girlfriend again.

Exeter Crown Court heard Scott, from Exmouth, Devon, has 27 convictions for 44 offences.

Judge Francis Gilbert QC said: 'You have a record for violence and aggressive behaviour, often when in drink.'

He said Scott had a restraining order banning him from contact with his father and when he harassed his ex-girlfriend the last time, he also intimidated her and his own mother about giving evidence against him.

The judge said the latest offences were relevant to what he had done to his ex-girlfriend before.

Judge Gilbert said during the bridge incident Scott punched her and pulled her hair before picking her up over the railings and with her head pointing towards the main road below where he threatened to drop her which would have caused her serious injury or worse.

A family driving below saw what he was doing and alerted the police and were ‘very shocked by his extreme aggression’.

The court heard Scott sent her a letter from jail intimidating her saying he held a grudge adding ‘it was far from over and not to underestimate me’.

The prosecution said Scott sent three letters to his ex girlfriend in breach of the restraining order in May and July.

Defence lawyer Rupert Taylor said the letters ‘professed his affections for her’ but the judge disagreed saying they caused her ‘considerable harassment’ and threatening to ‘stab’ her new boyfriend ‘in the face’.

Mr Taylor said one letter expressed he was ‘truly sorry’ and saying his ex-girlfriend was ‘still the one I miss, love and think about’ but the judge said Scott acted ‘regardless of her wishes’.

While Scott wrote telling her she was ‘still the girl I want to spend the rest of my life with’ the judge replied: 'She wants to be left alone.

He was jailed for a total of eight months, suspended for two years, and told to pay £100 victim surcharge.

The judge warned him that if there are any more breaches of the restraining order he will face more time behind bars, saying: 'You must be very careful.'
