Controversial wannabe glamour model Josie Cunningham has been pictured taking her children to school in a taxpayer-funded taxi, moments after smoking a cigarette.

The 23-year-old from Leeds, who infamously had a £4,800 breast enlargement operation on the NHS, was pictured days after it emerged her council is spending £6,000 a year on the cab journeys.

The pregnant mother-of-two and her children, aged six and three, are driven two-and-a-half miles to and from the local school every day in a journey which costs Leeds Council £30 a day.

She receives the free taxi journeys on health grounds, after claiming she is now so hated that she cannot use public transport without facing abuse - and the stress was giving her anxiety attacks.

The photographs also showed her holding a cigarette before getting into the car, after it was revealed she is smoking 20 cigarettes a day and will only quit if the taxpayer helps her kick the habit.

Yesterday, Miss Cunningham clashed with Loose Women co-host Myleene Klass who suggested it was wrong that NHS money was used to fund her £4,800 cosmetic surgery.

She insisted: 'It has been used in the wrong places, but not with me', and told a shocked ITV audience that she wanted to be an 'inspiration to young women with 0 per cent breast tissue'.

Before her appearance - which caused a stir on Facebook and Twitter - she tweeted a photo of herself in the changing rooms with the message: 'Not long till I'm on Loose Women... Haters are going to hate regardless.'

The talk show’s presenters began the interview by saying that it was an opportunity to 'explain her side' after continuous negative publicity.

Miss Cunningham said: 'You expect a bias opinion when you put yourself out there in the media. I won't say I disagree with everything they say. I did the first story so I can be an inspiration for young women or women of any age that are suffering from 0 per cent breast tissue.

'I have received a lot of abuse online and have just been bullied all my life for having no boobs. I am not going to be bullied again.'

She added that her GP never offered her counselling, instead opting for the operation.

Miss Cunningham also used her appearance to defend her use of taxpayer-funded taxis.

The journeys, which cost Leeds Council £30 a day, would cost around £30 a week by bus, but Miss Cunningham insisted it was worth it, and said taxpayers should be grateful it was taxis rather than more expensive private hire cars.

This year Leeds City Council is having to make savings of £50million from its budget.

Fear: The mother-to-be defended her use of taxpayer-funded taxis, suggesting she developed anxiety issues after angry bus passengers confronted her

Pout: Miss Cunningham pictured leaving the ITV 
studios after appearing on Loose Women this morning where she clashed 
with Myleene Klass on whether her boob operation should have been funded
 by the taxpayer

She said: 'I have been suffering with anxiety for about the last year now. Initially I was fine with the bus,' she said.

Miss Cunningham has reportedly called police after a Coronation Street star claimed she wanted to ‘smack’ her over the taxpayer-funded taxis row.

Catherine Tyldesley (right), who plays barmaid Eva Price in the ITV soap, had said on Twitter: ‘If she ever gets on my bus, I’ll smack her myself. #disgrace.’

The 30-year-old actress has since deleted the tweet, but Miss Cunningham told The Sun: ‘She glorified an attack on a pregnant woman to over 200,000 people’.

Miss Tyldesley’s spokesman insisted that the comment was a ‘figure of speech’, adding that she ‘doesn't condone violence’.

Her fellow star Simon Gregson, who plays Steve McDonald, said on Twitter: ‘I wonder if the Government will pay for my transport [because] I don't want my moobs on a bus.’

‘It
 is more of a confrontation in front of the kids really. It's not on. 
Any mother would agree. I have never said that I can't go on a bus 
because I am famous.'

She 
said passengers tended to direct their frustration at her, angry about 
her breast operation.

Klass then asked her: 'But can you understand that
 kind of anger?

Miss Cunningham replied: 'I fully understand that. But the hatred shouldn't necessarily be aimed towards myself.

'There is more that the NHS should be doing to help these people. People who are not getting the funding.'

When
 asked about plans to abort her baby, she said producers from Channel 5 
had approached her about appearing in the Big Brother house and asked to
 meet at a hotel in Manchester.

'It was all looking promising. But then I informed them that I was pregnant and it went downhill from there,' she said.

Miss
 Cunningham then explained that she does not believe the father of her 
unborn child will be around, but said she strives to provide a 'stable 
future for her kids'.

Criticism: She was grilled by Mylene Klass, who suggested taxpayers' money had been used in the wrong place when it came to her boob job

Interrogation: The panel directed hard-hitting questions at Josie which sparked a flurry of comments on Twitter about the controversial mother of two

Anger: She sparked outrage after posting a provocative tweet saying: 'Sticks and stones may break my bones, but tax payers will always fund me'

She 
said: 'There was a lot of work opportunities in the pipeline, but then I
 sat down and thought about it like a good mother should. This career 
can't be approached with a third child. I have actually gone from being 
on benefits to a self-employed single mother at the age of 23.

Smoking:
 Pregnant Miss Cunningham said she's cut down the cigarettes from 40 to 
20 a day but wants help from the doctor to help her quit

'My
 career is made up of a lot of things. Whether it is dealing with media 
inquiries or photo shoots. I have also had my first endorsement with the
 Pull the Pig dating website.'

Miss
 Cunningham, who is pregnant after working as an escort girl, revealed 
in The Sun that she had cut down from 40 cigarettes a day to 20, but 
would need help from her GP to cut the habit completely.

She
 said on the ITV show: 'I'm hoping my doctor will be able to help get me
 off the fags.  But the public will probably whinge about funding that 
as well.'

Anti-smoking advice, counselling, drugs and patches are all available on the NHS, but at a cost to the taxpayer.

News
 that Miss Cunningham had had a breast augmentation, funded by the same 
NHS trust that refused to fund surgery that would have enabled a 
two-year-old girl with a form of cerebral palsy to walk, provoked 
outrage across the country.

Miss
 Cunningham later claimed her breasts, which were boosted from a 32A to a
 36D, were ‘so big’ she found them embarrassing, and said the NHS should
 pay for a reduction.

Then she tried to placate public opinion by promising to pay back the cash.    

But
 when she became pregnant after working as a £1,000-a-night escort, she 
admitted she could not uphold her pledge – and now continues to soak up 
public funds.

She has had 
£1,500 of Botox treatment for excessive sweating, and two months ago, 
she boasted she would be having £2,500 of free dental work now she is 
expecting.
