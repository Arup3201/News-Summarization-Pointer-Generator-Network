A two-year-old girl has made an astonishing recovery after she was bound in duct tape and left in a cold shower until she lost consciousness.

Though Alexis Salaz was initially pronounced brain dead at the hospital, she has made a remarkable recovery, surmounting both physical and mental disabilities.

The child’s aunt, 50-year-old Mary Horsley, was found guilty of felony child abuse and faces between 20 to 48 years in prison when sentenced next month.

During the trial, jurors heard that the Colorado Springs woman would often put tape over her niece’s eyes and put her in the shower as punishment for any small misstep. 

Deputy District Attorney Debbie Pearson told the court of the torture borne by Alexis. ‘If she moved, she was dunked. If she cried, she was dunked,’ the Colorado Springs Gazette reported.

Ms Pearson continued: ‘Alexis never had a break. It was constant, constant torture.’

Alexis’ mother and Horsley’s niece, 19-year-old Samantha Salaz, also pleaded guilty to child abuse resulting in serious injury, and received a 24-year prison sentence.

Horsley’s attorney, Ed Farry, plans to appeal. He argued that Salaz – not Horsley – was to blame for Alexis’ injuries.

However, Horsley was acquitted of the most serious charge against her -attempted murder – but was convicted for abusing two of her grandchildren as well.

The child’s father, Joseph Saunders, said in an email to KRDO that he was unaware he was a father until the trial; Salaz apparently told him that he had miscarried.

'If she moved, she was dunked. If she cried, she was dunked. Alexis never had a break. It was constant, constant torture.'

Still, the father is grateful for her daughter, and notices improvement every day.

He said: ‘Within months of living with my wife, our kids and I, she had started regaining some physical activity, and its seemed as if her brain started “turning on.”’

He added: ‘She is a true miracle.’

Alexis has a long road to recovery yet – according to Mr Saunders, she has to attend therapy five times a week, and cannot walk, talk, or eat on her own.
