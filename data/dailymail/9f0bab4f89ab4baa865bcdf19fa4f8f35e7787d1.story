West Ham striker Andy Carroll hasn't had much luck on the pitch lately after injuring his knee in February, which ruled him out for the rest of the season, but he's been keeping busy away from Upton Park.

The former Liverpool striker, who has struggled for injuries since sealing his £15m move to the Hammers in 2013, was pictured building a rocking chair for his baby he's expecting with fiance Billi Mucklow.

Carroll was obviously missing his team as he wore a West Ham training kit while reading instructions on how to build the chair.

The Hammers' record signing stepped up his recovery this week and completed a spin and gym session. 

The latest injury, which he suffered against Southampton in February, joins a long list of injuries the 26-year-old has suffered throughout his career. 

But Carroll was in high spirits as he looks forward to welcoming the new addition to the family.
