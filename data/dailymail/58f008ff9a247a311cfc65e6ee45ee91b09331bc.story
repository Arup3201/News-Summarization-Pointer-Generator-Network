All that fun buying a new frock can often be ruined by the torturous wait at a till to pay for it.

But thanks to a new mobile phone app, you may never have to queue again. In fact, you may even be able to pay while you’re trying on the clothes in the fitting room.

The ‘InStore’ app from online payment firm PayPal will allow shoppers to purchase goods on the shop floor in less than 30 seconds.

PayPal inStore works by generating a barcode on screen, which the shop then scans to take money from the customer's account

The app is locked by a PIN, and no financial details are stored in the phone itself

Shop assistants carry portable scanners which are used to read the barcodes on customers’ goods wherever they are in store.

Shoppers then use their PayPal app to enter a passcode, which produces a unique barcode on the screen of the phone.

This second barcode is then scanned 
by a shop assistant, which completes the sale while avoiding the need to
 visit a conventional cash till.

Receipts are automatically sent to a 
shopper’s email. It has been launched at 230 branches of fashion stores 
Oasis, Warehouse, Coast and Karen Millen today with more stores expected
 to accept the payments later this year.

The app can also be used to issue refunds, with the barcodes stored in the phone, and able to be brought back to the store for a refund

No personal or financial information is 
stored on the phone - and the app is locked with a PIN code, so if a 
phone is stolen, it's useless.

The app can also be used to issue 
refunds, with the barcodes stored in the phone, and able to be brought 
back to the store for a refund.

To begin with the app will only work in fashion chains Coast, Oasis and Warehouse as well as Karen Millen.

The service launches nationally on 31st May and will be available in 230 stores.

Cameron McLean, managing director of 
PayPal UK, said: ‘Today marks the start of a quiet revolution in the way
 we shop on the high street.

'We’ve created a simple, secure way to use a
 mobile phone to pay in your favourite stores.’

Millions have already been invested 
in developing ‘contactless’ technology, which lets us buy goods without 
inserting a card into a machine.

Barclaycard and Orange launched Quick 
Tap last year – where shoppers can spend up to £15 by waving their phone
 over an electronic pad. However, customers using this still need to go 
to a till.
