Burka fugitive Mohammed Ahmed Mohamed is believed to be a follower of the world's most wanted female terrorist, British 'White Widow' Samantha Lewthwaite, and may have fled abroad to join her.

The Somali-born 27-year-old has been on the run for four days after removing his electronic tag and giving surveillance officers the slip by walking out of a mosque in Acton, west London, in a full cloak.

He has links to Al-Shabaab - a terror group that Lewthwaite is believed to help lead - and Mohamed may be trying to leave the UK to join them on a fake passport.

Fanatics belonging to the terror group, which recruits extremists from all over the world, were behind the Kenyan mall massacre which left 67 people dead. They are also accused of plotting attacks on Western interests in east Africa.

A Kenyan intelligence file shows a direct link between Mohamed, Lewthwaite - the widow of 7/7 bomber Germaine Lindsay - and the terrorist group.

'It is known that his associates have
 access to false passports and cash to facilitate international travel,'
 a source told the Mirror.

'The
 fear is that will try to join up with his former terror unit to help 
carry out attacks like the one we saw in Nairobi in September.'

Two former leaders of Al-Shabaab, Saleh Nabhan and Harun Fazul, who trained Lewthwaite, are named in a High Court judgement on Mohamed's appeal against his Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measure.

According to the Mirror a High Court judge described the national security case against Mohamed - named only as CC - as 'overwhelming'.

The Mirror reports the following passages form the judgment, by Lord Justice Jones, who wrote: 'The Security Service assesses that CC is linked to a group of British nationals who received terrorist training from al-Qaeda operatives, Saleh Nabhan and Harun Fazul in Somalia in 2006.

'It assesses that the group returned to the United Kingdom in late 2006 and early 2007 and has evolved into a well established and prolific extremist facilitation network, actively supporting extremist associates in East Africa.

'The network consists of a UK-based group and an East-Africa based group. The UK-based group supports the activities of the associates in Somalia and also seeks to recruit and radicalise further individuals.'

It is understood Mohamed took part in terrorist training in 2008 and is believed to have helped various individuals travel from the UK to Somalia to allow them to engage in terrorism-related activity.

Mohamed, who is 5ft 8in and of medium build, is also suspected of helping to plan attacks in Somalia and overseas, including an attack intended for the Juba Hotel in Mogadishu in 2010.

He is thought to be a member of a UK-based network that had access to money, false passports and documentation, as well as equipment, and is understood to have procured funds and weapons for terrorism uses for the network.

It emerged last night that he repeatedly purchased phone cards used to call contacts overseas in the weeks before he fled.

He bought the international Lycamobile cards from a newsagent close to the An-Noor Masjid Mosque and Community Centre in west London â€“ the same mosque from which he made his escape dressed in a burka last Friday.

The purchase of the phone cards will fuel suspicions he had long been plotting to escape abroad, possibly back to his Al-Shabaab associates in Somalia.

Security officials fear he may already be overseas, and there are question marks about how he was able to disable his tag because it should trigger an alarm.

'If Mohamed tore off his tag, an anti-tamper alert should have been activated,' a source told The Sun.

"If it did activate, why was it not acted upon more quickly?"
