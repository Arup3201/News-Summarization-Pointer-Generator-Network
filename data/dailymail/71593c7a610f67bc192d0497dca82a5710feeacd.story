A 911 operator taking calls when two NYPD officers were murdered this weekend allegedly said the victims 'deserved it', sparking a row with other emergency services, it was claimed.

A worker in the call center is said to have outraged colleagues at the FDNY with their 'anti-police' remarks while officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu were dying, the New York Daily News reported

Details of the alleged behind-the-scenes argument came as it emerged the gunman who killed the men had posted details online of an app he used to track police movements.

Cop tracker: Screenshots emerged of Brinsley posting to Instagram about his use of the Waze app - on which users post updates

Ismaaiyl Brinsley, 28, posted screenshots of an app called Waze - on which users can upload details of officer movements.

He wrote of his admiration for Waze, according to screenshots taken by Breitbart, which he was using to track two officers in Staten Island, New York, on his Instagram page. The post was said to be made in early December.

He used the same account to announce his intentions to gun down the two officers in Brooklyn, styling it as a revenge attack for the deaths of Eric Garner and Michael Brown. It has since been deleted.

Officers continue to investigate exactly what Brinsley was doing in the hours before he opened fire on the his targets, but there has been no suggestion he used the app to find his eventual targets.

Meanwhile, details of the alleged argument in the 911 call center came to light - as one FDNY handler told the News the comments made him 'sick to his stomach'.

The unnamed man then said he moved to avoid further confrontation.

However, call center authorities say they have no record of the spat - and that nobody was disciplined in relation to it.

A spokesman for District Council 37, the public sector organization which runs the call center, added: 'The 911 call operators are extremely dedicated to their jobs and do everything they can to protect and help police officers at all times.'

The NYPD did not immediately comment on either the alleged call center incident, or Brinsley's use of Waze.
