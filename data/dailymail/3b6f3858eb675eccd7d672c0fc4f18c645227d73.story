A father has claimed he was threatened with being removed from a bus by the driver because his deaf toddler was being too noisy.

Kyle Johnson was travelling back from a paediatric hospital appointment with his son Ethan when the two-year-old got excited and started talking loudly.

The driver called the 23-year-old over and said passengers on the Plymouth, Devon, bus had complained.

He allegedly told Mr Johnson, a supermarket cleaner, to make his son be quiet or face getting off the vehicle.

Mr Johnson managed to lull the toddler, who wears two over-the-ear hearing aids, to sleep in his pushchair and stay on the bus - but he has accused the First driver of discrimination.

He said: 'I explained to the driver that Ethan was deaf, but his response was "I really can't do a lot, I've had complaints".

'It's just discrimination against a disabled child at the end of the day.  

'I don't want the driver to be in trouble, but I do want people to have more awareness of deaf children.

'I've had a couple of friends who have deaf children and they've told me it's happened to them numerous times.'

Ethan suffers moderate hearing loss in one ear and severe loss in the other, and was travelling home from a development check up at Scott Hospital.

Mr Johnson said the driver called him over a few stops into the short journey back to their house on Wednesday to give them the warning.

He said it was the second time he has been threatened by bus drivers over Ethan making too much noise. 

He said: 'The first time was when Ethan was much younger and didn't have his hearing aids and he was shouting at the top of his voice.

'That was on a longer journey when we were on our way back from Derriford Hospital.

'I know it happens to a lot of parents of deaf children and it's not something they can help.'

A spokesman for First Bus Group apologised for the 'difficult journey' and said all drivers get customer service and disability awareness training.

He said: 'However, as you would expect we cannot anticipate every situation and we don't have a specific instruction for drivers for the set of circumstances as described by Mr Johnson.

'Therefore, in such rare and unpredictable situations, it is left to driver discretion. 

'We absolutely recognise how important it is that bus services are accessible for all customers and are currently involved in a number of initiatives to explore specifically how our services can become more accessible for the deaf community.'

First Bus Group confirmed it is investigating.
