A married New York investment banker has thrown himself out his seventh-floor Upper East Side apartment window after a battle with the co-op board over his three prized poodles; Prince Polo, Princess Jasmine and Prince Bonbon.

Adam Silberman, 47, husband of high-flying Manhattan real estate broker Monique Ender Silberman, was rushed to hospital after the dramatic dive at around 10.18 a.m. yesterday.

He is in intensive care at Weill Cornell Medical Center being treated for 'multiple trauma' injuries including broken bones, and doctors put a balloon in his aorta to avoid blood clotting, police said.

According to his father-in-law, Paul Lord Ender, Silberman had been depressed after neighbors complained about the couple's dogs barking and playing in the lobby, prompting an ongoing battle with the co-op board.

One dog had already been sent away, The New York Post reported.

Police also found 'crack paraphernalia' during a search of the couple's apartment at 860 Fifth Avenue near 68th Street, according to The Post.

It wasn't clear, however, whether Silberman used the drug himself.

A family friend of Silberman's, Michael Moss, insisted Silberman did not abuse alcohol or illegal substances.

He said the banker's troubles were all down to his high pressure job and beloved pets.

'The stress was too much for him,' Moss told The Post, adding that his own daughter took one of the French poodles off the Silbermans hands last week.

Ender, who, with his wife, Simone, owns the Silbermans plush apartment, agreed the pooch problems were taking their toll on his son-in-law.

'He
was depressed about the situation,' Ender told The Post.

'It's horrible
what happened. I've been praying and crying the whole day.'

However, the newspaper reports money 
troubles were also plaguing the couple, who vacation at the Hamptons and
regularly appear in New York social pages.

According to public records, the Silbermans were hit with more than $650,000 in state and federal tax liens during the past five years.

On top of that, their co-op corporation has an $18,000 judgment against Monique Ender Silberman's parents, The post reported.

Silberman miraculously survived the seventh floor swan dive after he struck an awning on the second floor, which broke his fall, police sources said.
