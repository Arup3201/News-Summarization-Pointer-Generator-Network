Three men are in hospital after having bleach thrown in their faces in a suspected homophobic hate crime with one man believing he might have lost his sight.

The 23 year-old is thought to have been hit with bleach in a hate crime involving two woman and a male assailant outside the Lightbox club in south London.

He and a male friend, 21, had struck up a conversation with the trio 
outside the club after being refused entry because it was past closing 
time.

Police wish to find these three people following an ammonia chemical attack in South London at the weekend

But the women, thought to be Eastern European, began hurling homophobic abuse at the pair when they discovered they were gay.

One of the victims has described 
feeling his face 'melting' when his attacker sprayed him with the 
chemical at around 4am on Sunday.

The older victim said: 'As we walked away I heard a man shout 'Oi! Come 
here.' At first I thought it was the doorman saying he'd changed his 
mind and we could go in.

'Then I saw this white guy with a beard, and his hand coming up with a water bottle that he squirted really hard into my face.

The first attack occurred outside 
Lightbox, (pictured) which is located on South Lambeth Place, where two men were 
sprayed in the face with the substance following a row with another 
group nearby

'It went right in my eyes and it 
sprayed into my friend's mouth. My face was burning so much, I thought 
it was acid. I thought I would never see again and my face was melting.

'He poured every last drop onto us and then turned around and walked away, like it was mission accomplished.

'The chemical burnt the cornea in my left eye and the vision hasn't 
cleared since. The doctors said it should hopefully return but there is 
no guarantee.

'My friend's tongue was swollen and it looked like someone had scratched part of it away. It was horrible.'

The owners of the nightclub have issued a statement, condemning the 'homophobic attack'.

Spokesperson Mark Williams, from Lightbox owners Orange Nation, said: 'Unfortunately, there was a homophobic attack outside the cafe by Vauxhall Bus Station early on Sunday morning.

'This was an isolated incident and we have been speaking to police since it occurred, including supplying them with our CCTV footage of the local Vauxhall area.

'The police have confirmed there is no direct link with the venue or our customers.

'Our doors were closed at the time of the incident, with no gay events at the Lightbox that morning.

'Our extensive commitment with the council and Vauxhall One to provide a safe environment for everyone continues.

'Our thoughts go out to the victims of this awful attack and we wish them a speedy recovery.'

Police are treating the attack as a homophobic hate crime because of comments made during
 the argument.

The victim added: 'I feel this was a hate crime given where we were and the situation with the two girls.

'What's playing on my mind is the fact that this guy has left his flat and thought 'wallet, keys, bottle of bleach.'

'The guy has gone out with the intention of blinding someone.'

It later emerged that a third man had been hit in another random acid attack inside the venue earlier in the evening on Sunday.

All three men were treated at hospital.

Police have now released CCTV images of the suspects. There have been no arrests.

Ammonia is a powerful chemical which can cause blindness if it comes into contact with the eye, and severe burns if it comes into contact with skin.
