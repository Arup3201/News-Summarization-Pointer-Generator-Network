With the roars of the crowd and all of Britain in his ears, Andy Murray, Britain's first Men's Wimbledon Champion in 77 years, climbed into the stands to shake hands and share the moment with everyone who made it possible.

In a Wimbledon tradition, Murray climbed into the player’s box where he first hugged coach Ivan Lendl, then girlfriend Kim Sears, along with other members of his team, but he then turned to climb back down to the court - completely forgetting his mother directly behind him.

His gaffe was brought to his attention and he quickly ran over to Judy Murray, 53, and gave Britain's proudest mother a hug and a kiss, to the delight of the wildly cheering crowd.

Good work, son: Judy Murray, Andy Murray's staunchest supporter, gets a hug from her triumphant son - eventually

Her joy and pride was plain for all to see as she beamed at her son, after so much pressure, so many dashed hopes, fulfilled the dream of Britons everywhere. She broke down in tears and could be heard to say 'finally' as she hugged other supporters in the box.

She said: 'It's the best feeling ever to see your son win Wimbledon.

'This is what he has talked about winning since he was a little boy, it was a dream that has become a reality now for him.'

Murray admitted she found it hard to watch her son's triumph.

Stalwart: Judy Murray has been behind her son every step of the tournament

'I have been shaking for the last three hours," she added.

Should Andy Murray be given a knighthood for winning Wimbledon?

'I am fine now but 15 minutes ago (just before Murray won) I was an emotional wreck.

'I can't remember exactly what happened. I know he was 40-0 up in the last game and then it went to deuce, but he gutsed it out.

'There were some outrageous points in the final game.

'They had been out there for three hours and it was so hot, but he was so determined to win it.'

Murray was seeded second for the tournament behind Djokovic, but his mother always suspected her son would go on to become the first British man since Fred Perry to triumph at the All England Club.

'I had a good feeling,' she said.

'He has been strong and composed all week, but Novak is such a tough competitor so to bury him you have to play unbelievably.

'You have to play your A game to win and Andy brought a pretty decent game today.'

After her moment with her son she was congratulated by the parents of his vanquished opponent Novak Djokovic.

The Murray matriarch has passionately supported her son throughout the tournament, and indeed throughout his entire career.

Joy: Before the match Judy Murray, was seen laughing with Ronnie Wood of The Rolling Stones and smiling, but during the game she admits she was an 'emotional wreck'

She has also brought
 laughter to the BBC commentary box by light-heartedly flirting with a 
presenter earlier in the tournament.

For her son’s last two matches, Judy 
Murray, 53, has sat with Radio 5 Live’s George Riley, most recently in 
the players’ box on Centre Court.

They were seen giggling, whispering and sharing a bag of sweets. And they have also been exchanging jokey Twitter messages.

In February she revealed she has been the victim of hate mail sent by fans of her son.

Critics describe her as a constant domineering presence, a woman who refuses to cut the apron strings.

Even tennis legend Boris Becker has joined in, blaming her attendance for her son losing last year’s final of the Australian Open.

It appears her support has now been vindicated.
