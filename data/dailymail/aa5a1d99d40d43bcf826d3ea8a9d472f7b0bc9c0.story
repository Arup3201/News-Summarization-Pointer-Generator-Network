Rolf Harris, 84, pictured before he was jailed, has reportedly lost a stone since being behind bars

Disgraced Rolf Harris has reportedly lost a stone since being jailed because he does not like the taste of prison food.

The 84-year-old entertainer, who was convicted for 12 indecent assaults in June, previously enjoyed eating curried lobster and roast quail as part of his pre-prison diet.

But he now has to make do with meals such as tuna salads and low-fat chicken curries at HMP Bullingdon in Oxfordshire.

Harris, who is serving five years and nine months at the prison, has reportedly seen his weight plummet as a result. 

A source told The Sun: 'This is a world away from what he is used to.'  

According to the Ministry of Justice, prisoners must be provided with three meals a day.

Breakfast includes a continental breakfast, while there are a minimum of five options at every meal time.

There must be at least one hot meal, as well as one vegan choice, one vegetarian choice and one Halal choice. 

A typical menu shows that dinner options include shepherd's pie, pasta bake, white fish in tomato and basil sauce and Halal chicken curry.

Lunch options include cous cous with bread, a variety of sandwiches and pasta salad boxes. 

Guidance given to catering managers by the MoJ says prisons should 'constantly review their practices in order to provide increasingly healthy meals'.

Recommended ways of doing this include replacing saturated fats with unsaturated fats, using reduced fat products such as skimmed milk where possible and 'using one layer of pastry rather than two'.

The guidance also suggests using oatmeal 'for coatings or to add to crumbles and other suitable dishes'.

Caterers are also told that a third to a half of all cold desserts should be decorated with fresh or dried fruits rather than 'over-relying on piped cream'. 

Harris, who is serving five years and nine months for the offences, has had a tough time since arriving at the prison as he has become a 'hate figure', one inmate said.

in July, he was spat at by an inmate during a prison church service which sparked a mass brawl.

Rolf Harris has become a 'hate figure' since being put behind bars at HMP Bullingdon in Oxfordshire 

The fellow prisoner shouted insults from the pews of the chapel, before attempting to spit on the convicted paedophile.

When it missed and hit another prisoner, a grapple broke out between the two convicts, who had to be separated by officers. Harris was ‘was not physically hurt’ in the scuffle.

Two weeks ago, it also emerged that Rolf Harris had angered fellow inmates after being handed a ‘plum job’ as a prison gardener. Other prisoners believe he may have ‘jumped the queue’ to land the cushy role.

Harris is now being paid to look after the vegetable patch and parts of the ground, despite one prisoner saying he had been waiting 12 months for a similar job.

But he has since softened inmates by signing drawings for convicts who queue outside his cell, it was reported.  

The entertainer, once a family favourite, was unmasked as a paedophile who was fixated with underage girls after his trial at Southwark Crown Court.

He was jailed for his decades preying on victims including and abusing his daughter's friend for 16 years. He even attacked her as his daughter slept in the same room.  

His fall from grace was underlined as he was stripped of a Bafta fellowship and accolades in his native Australia were removed, and he faces losing his prestigious CBE.

The performer's multi-million pound fortune is also at risk from potential compensation claims.

Earlier this month it was confirmed that lawyers representing Harris have lodged papers at the Court of Appeal asking for permission to appeal against his conviction for 12 counts of indecent assault.  

The court will now consider whether to grant permission for him to continue with his appeal bid.

No-one from the Prison Service was available for comment.
