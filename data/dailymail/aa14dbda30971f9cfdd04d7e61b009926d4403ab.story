An invasion of Asian super ants is believed to have spread across southern England after a massive nest was found in London.

The UK’s first colony of the insects, which are attracted to electricity and munch through cables sparking fires and blackouts, was reported in 2009 at Hidcote Manor, Gloucestershire.

Experts were called in to get rid of them but it is believed many ants escaped and have since colonised a huge swathe of southern England.

The nests found at a home in Hendon, north London, last week are believed to be the first in the capital, but there are fears the whole of the UK could be swarming with the pests within the next ten years.

Asian super ants, which swarm together rather than crawling in lines like garden ants, form large colonies with interconnected nests spreading over many miles. 

They are dependant on the sugary liquid called honeydew left by aphids, form ‘super colonies’, with many queens and interconnected nests spreading out over many miles.

The ants, called Lasius neglectus, were first found 20 years ago in Europe after a colony was found in Budapest, Hungary, and have now colonised areas of Germany, France, Spain and Poland.

If the ants from Gloucestershire have made it all the way to London - almost exactly 100 miles from where they were first found in 2009 - it could mean they have marched through Gloucestershire, Oxfordshire and Bucks before reaching the capital.

Bosses at Cleankill Environmental Services say they were called out to home in Hendon last week after the owners noticed that the ants were ‘behaving oddly’ and that there were ‘tens of thousands of them’.

The species are drawn to electricity, a compulsion that is stronger in the ants that the drive to eat or drink, and the can cause blackouts and fires by eating through electrical cables.

In the house in Hendon, pest controllers found thousands of the ants inside the couple’s microwave and other electrical equipment as well as in the garden and a bedroom.

Chris Davis, one of the managers with Cleankill, said yesterday that the find in London was a ‘wake up call’ that the ants are spreading across the UK.

He said: 'Initially our technician thought they were garden ants but then we noticed they were behaving in an unusual way and they weren’t following trails.

'They were being seen absolutely everywhere in the house including the microwave and on a bed.

'We sent a sample of insects to experts who identified them as Asian super ants, and with treatment advice from (fellow pest control experts) at Killgerm Chemicals and Bayer we were able to modify our inspection and treatment procedures accordingly.'

A spokesman for the firm said the ant infestation in Hendon was ‘serious’ and that it was harder to control and kill the super ants than normal black garden ants.

He said': 'Asian super ants form super colonies, sometimes consisting of tens of thousands of ants in interconnected nests.

'New satellite colonies are formed by ‘budding’ - ants leaving the ‘home nest’ and forming new colonies.

'These satellites may be very small, for instance in a potted plant, and it is thought that in this way the super-colonies can gradually develop.

'This budding behaviour means that the ants can be easily transported by commerce and seed a new colony.

'These nests do not compete with each other although they do compete strongly with other ant species in the area. Nests are found in leaf litter, under paving, and other stones, and around the base of trees.'
