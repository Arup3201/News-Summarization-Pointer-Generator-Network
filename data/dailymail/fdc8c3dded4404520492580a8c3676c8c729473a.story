Emmanuel Adebayor has promised to try and win back the Tottenham fans after ending his first team exile with a return at Manchester United.

Adebayor admits he has come through a 'dark moment' and has fallen from favour at a club where he was a goal hero this time last year.

He understands how quickly things change in football and issued a warning to Harry Kane on this score, but vowed to join forces as they attempt to salvage Spurs' top four aspirations.

The Togo international has vowed to win back the supporters after going through a 'dark moment'

Aston Villa (home) - April 11

Newcastle (away) - April 19

Southampton (away) - April 25

'I went through a little bit of a dark moment in my career but now I am back training hard and that's it,' said the Togo international.

'A lot of things went wrong. We are all human beings. We all go through a lot at certain time of our lives. I think I have learned from it. I went through a lot of family issues. As I said earlier on, now it is behind me and I am back on the football pitch. I am very glad to be back.'

Adebayor, 31, returned as a late substitute at Old Trafford on Sunday, his first appearance for nearly two months, during which he returned to Africa to address family problems.

While he was out 21-year-old Kane has reinforced his position as Tottenham's first-choice striker.

Adebayor said: 'I'm very happy and pleased for Harry Kane, who has been doing fantastic. In football, we all have our moments. He is a young lad that came out and at the moment, I think he is the only one that can save our season, like I did the last season.

'Two years ago, it was Gareth Bale. So you know, football is always changing. I am very happy for him, very pleased for him. He is a young lad. He is learning through his difficult moment as well but he is fantastic player.

VIDEO Top four still possible - Pochettino

Adebayor has fallen out of favour with Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino and had been criticised by fans

Adebayor had not featured for Tottenham since the end of January in the 2-1 FA Cup defeat by Leicester

Tottenham's defeat by United left them six points adrift of the top four places

'If he keeps scoring two goals every weekend, he can help us into the top four. But don't get me wrong, now people are starting to get to know him and what he can do and what he cannot do, his positives and negatives on the pitch.

'But he is an intelligent lad and he just has to find his way again and bounce back. We all have a huge faith and believe in him. Hopefully, he will drag us out of the top seven and put us in the top four.

'And for me, sitting on the bench, as a player, I have been there before. I just have to work hard on the pitch and come back and play football. Football is a fun game. Today, you are zero. Tomorrow, you are a hero and the most important thing is you, what makes you happy, keep believing, keep doing your thing on the pitch.'

Adebayor was in demand on transfer deadline day in January, when he rejected a move to QPR but almost joined West Ham before Spurs chairman Daniel Levy blocked the loan transfer.

'That is already behind me,' said Adebayor. 'I am still at Tottenham so for me, the most important thing is now Tottenham and help the team achieve our target which is to finish in the top four. Don't get me wrong, it's going to be hard but at the moment, just let me focus on my game and how I can help the team. 

Adebayor was given the captain's armband for the second leg of the Captial One Cup semi-final against Sheffield United in January

Adebayor posted this picture to Instagram days before the United match, with a message saying it is not important what people think of you, but who you are

'Why not? I am part of the squad. I am very happy. And for me, the most important thing … I'm not 21 years old any more. I am 31 and I look at things differently. As I said, I am available. We have a lot of fantastic players in the squad and the manager has a choice to make.

'If I am in, like when I came in for ten minutes I run around, I did what I can do and whenever I am selected, I just have to help my team and show respect for them and show respect for the club.

'The summer is a long way to go. We've got what, nine games to go? Which is almost two months. So we've got plenty of time. At the moment, I'm a footballer, I'm a professional... keep doing my work, keep doing my job as professional as I can. At the beginning of the last season, everyone wanted me out; at the end of the season, they wanted me to stay. I just have to keep believing in myself, keeping doing my thing.

'I travelled to Europe to be a footballer and today, I am a footballer. Already, I am very glad because obviously in my country, only God knows how many people would love to wear the Tottenham shirt today and play for Tottenham. So whenever I have a chance to wake up and be alive, I always thank God for that and for me, all the rest is a bonus. Keep enjoying my life, keep enjoying myself.'

Adebayor was booed onto the pitch at Old Trafford by travelling Spurs fans, upset with what they consider a casual attitude and comments made earlier in the season that the team would rather play away than at White Hart Lane. 

Adebayor came close to leaving Spurs in January but chairman Daniel Levy blocked a move to West Ham

The striker returned to favour under Tim Sherwood last season and scored 11 goals after January

He added: 'I don't know if I have been punished or not but what I know is, I'm me, I'm being me, and if I have to say it and correct the future for the club, I will do it. Don't get me wrong, this club has given me the chance to play again in London and I'm so grateful.

'If Tottenham won the cup a few weeks ago, I'm part of the club that won the Capital One Cup in 2015. Tottenham didn't win it. Me and the fans are in the same boat. So today, obviously, I am very disappointed and I think the fans are disappointed as well. At the end of the day, somebody will say something that people will misunderstand and take the wrong way but I have nothing against the fans, I always love the fans.

'I don't want to get involved in that any more. It's behind and for me now, it's just play football and enjoy my life again. As a Togolese boy, who has suffered a lot and today he's in Europe. As I tell you before, my junior brother, my senior brother, my uncle, I think they would love to be in my position today, being a footballer, being a striker for Tottenham, trust me. Even just travelling with the team, a lot of my family members, a lot of my countrymen, would love to do that. For me, let me just enjoy it and embrace it.'
