Celtic boss Ronny Deila believes John Collins would make a brilliant successor to departing SFA performance director Mark Wotte.

But the Norwegian insists that he would hate to lose the right-hand man who has become so crucial to his plans.

Deila, reacting to suggestions that former SFA youth coach Collins may be on the list of potential candidates for the post about to be vacated by Wotte, said: ‘I can say that John Collins knows what he’s doing.

‘He’s a fantastic person with a lot of experience and knowledge about what is needed to become a good player.

‘But I want to have him here, so I really don’t hope that is happening. He is too important for me and the club.

‘But I understand that people want him,’ added the Norwegian, whose team host Partick Thistle in the League Cup quarter-finals tomorrow night. ‘He has helped me a lot. The most important thing is we have the same kind of view of football, we want to create and to play.

Collins has been linked with a role at SFA as performance director to replace the departing Mark Wotte

‘We know it takes time but we’re working together every day to do it. We just talked for two hours before we understood that this was going to work for us. We knew at once that we were going to have a good relationship.

‘That feeling has been proven right. Every day we have good discussions. I think we suit each other very well.’
