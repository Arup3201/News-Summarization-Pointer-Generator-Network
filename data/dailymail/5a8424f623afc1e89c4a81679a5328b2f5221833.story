Steve Jobs' ancestral home of Syria has banned the iPhone as the under-pressure government looks to crackdown on pro-democracy activists.

Syrian president Bashar Assad is attempting to crush an eight-month-old revolt against his autocratic rule which has led to violent protests across the country and thousands of deaths.

It has now been reported that the government has outlawed the iPhone - which was created by Jobs as CEO of Apple - in a bid to prevent activists from using the popular device to post footage of violent protests on the internet.

The ban would no doubt anger Jobs' biological father Abdulfattah John Jandali who is a native Syrian and recently came out in support of protesters in a YouTube video.

According to Times Live, the Lebanese website Al Nashara, said the ban had been issued by the Customs Department of the Syrian Finance Ministry.

A statement by the department read: 'The authorities warn anyone against using the iPhone in Syria.'

One Syrian activist, who wanted to remain anonymous, told the newspaper: 'It is enough for any tourist or guest visiting Syria to own an iPhone to be a spy suspect.

'Steve Jobs must be turning in his grave on learning that his iconic device is banned in his home country.'

The U.N.'s top human rights official warned on Thursday that Syria has entered a state of civil war with more than 4,000 people dead and an increasing number of soldiers defecting from the army to take up arms against the president.

The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, Navi Pillay, said the death toll for the revolt stands 'at 4,000 but really the information coming to us is that it's much more than that.'

Almost all foreign media has been banned from Syria since the protests began in March.

The Syrian government shut down the internet and 3G mobile networks in June in a bid to prevent protesters from communicating.

Jobs' biological father Mr Jandali, who did not have a relationship with his famous son, recently expressed his support for the pro-democracy protesters in a YouTube video.

He said: 'I am in solidarity with the Syrian people.

'I reject the brutality and killing that the Syrian authorities are committing against the innocent people in Syria.

'And because silence is participation in this crime, I declare my participation in the Syrian sit-in on YouTube.'

Mr Jandali is a Syrian immigrant to the U.S. and now works as vice president of a casino in Reno, Nevada.

He only learned that Jobs was his son in 2005 - one year after the technology icon was first diagnosed with cancer.

Before his son's death in October, he told how he had emailed Jobs a few times but had not called for fear he would wrongly think he was after his money.

'This might sound strange, though, but I am not prepared, even if either of us was on our deathbeds, to pick up the phone to call him,' Mr Jandali said.

'Steve will have to do that, as the Syrian pride in me does not want him ever to think I am after his fortune.

'Now I just live in hope that, before it is too late, he will reach out to me, because even to have just one coffee with him just once would make me a very happy man'.

It was 56 years ago that Mr Jandali's girlfriend Joanne Simpson fell pregnant and he was forbidden from marrying her.

Without telling him she left their home in Wisconsin and went to San Francisco where she have birth to Jobs and gave him up for adoption.
