A Melbourne council has been forced to admit that ratepayers  have been let down after forking out for $153,000 worth of golden ribbons and cardboard stars to line shopping strips in the lead-up to Christmas.

This is the first year Bayside council has put up decorations across nine shopping strips in Melbourne's southeastern exclusive waterside suburbs - and judging from the reaction of residents - it has been an epic fail.

The village streets are lined with golden ribbon wrapped around trees and cardboard golden stars placed on the side of rubbish bins and fences with the occasional pieces of tinsel.

Beaumaris resident Renata Frith said most people were complaining about the lack of creative effort.

'Its lovely to have festive spirit but there has been no positivity about it - it's more of an embarrassment really,' she told Daily Mail Australia.

'It's not really good use of money and it doesn't look that festive - it's just a ribbon around a tree.'

A shop manager on Bay St in Brighton, who did not want to be named, told Daily Mail Australia that she expected more for a nice suburb.

'It's pretty pathetic - it's just gold paper wrapped around a tree - I think it's a pretty poor effort,' she said.

'We have a lot of clients coming in and saying it is a poor effort - it's not even Christmasy decorations - there's not much Christmas spirit here.'

The decorations have been described as 'woeful', 'tragic', and 'embarrassing' by residents

The council admits to not meeting community's expectations with the first year of street decorations

Bayside Mayor Felicity Frederico has conceded that the council had needed lived up to the festive expectations of their ratepayers.

'In hindsight we probably tried to do too much with too little in our first year and spread ourselves too thin,' she said in a statement.

'We’re getting lots of feedback. We know we haven’t met community expectations in our first year.'

'We’ll review all that feedback in planning for next year to achieve a bigger impact.' 

Residents even took to the council's Facebook page to express their dissatisfaction over the decorations.

One ratepayer described them as 'woeful', 'tragic' and 'very tacky'. 

Another said the decorations were disappointing and embarrassing. 

Cr Frederico added that the decorations were part of a package to create a festive vibe in the shopping centres and support local traders who struggle to compete with the likes of Southland at Christmas. 

'We are also running a shop window display competition to encourage traders to decorate their shop windows and organising school and church groups to sing carols in our shopping strips,' she said.

The council will review the feedback in planning for next year to achieve a 'bigger impact'
