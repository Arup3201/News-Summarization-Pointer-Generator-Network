The terrifying risk of sinkholes opening up without warning has increased in large parts of the world.

In the U.S., a sinkhole recently swallowed eight rare cars at a Kentucky sports museum and in the UK, scientists have warned that more sinkholes are expected to swallow up Britain - and perhaps unsuspecting Britons - following the recent flooding.

Now Nasa has revealed that its radar data, routinely collected by satellites, may be able to predict these strange geological formations months before they appear.

The space agency claims that signs of a sinkhole that is now 25 acres large (10.1 hectares) and growing were caught by its radar before it opened.

The technique, while not able to detect all sinkholes, could help spot them in areas where sinkholes are likely to form.

Sinkholes are depressions in the ground formed when the Earth’s surface layers collapse into caverns below. They usually form without warning.

Nasa made its discovery after analysing data from a special kind of radar aboard a jet flying over the Louisiana coast in 2011 and 2012.

The team used an Uninhabited Airborne Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar (UAVSAR) to measure subtle lumps and holes in Earth's surface. Their study showed the surface layer deformed at least a month before the collapse, moving mostly horizontally up to 10.2 inches (260 mm) toward where the sinkhole would later form

Typically, sinkholes have no natural external surface drainage, and they form through natural processes and human activities.

They are usually the result of what are known as Karst processes. They occur when a layer of rock underneath the ground is dissolved by acidic water.

In many cases rainfall get through the soil, absorbing carbon dioxide and reacting with decaying vegetation.This causes the water to become acidic.

The acidic water causes the erosion of the soluble rock layers beneath the surface - eventually creating a sinkhole.

The deepest is China's Xiaozhai Tienkeng at 2172ft (662m).

The Qattara Depression in Egypt is roughly 50 miles (80km) by 75 miles (121km) in surface size.

The radar detected a huge sinkhole before it collapsed near Bayou Corne.

Researchers Cathleen Jones and Ron Blom analysed something known as interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) imagery.

This imagery uses an Uninhabited Airborne Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar (UAVSAR) to measure subtle lumps and holes in Earth's surface.

Their study showed the surface layer deformed at least a month before the collapse, moving mostly horizontally up to 10.2 inches (260 mm) toward where the sinkhole would later form.

These initial surface movements covered a much larger area - about 1,640 by 1,640 feet, (500 by 500 metres) - than that of the sinkhole, which measured about 2 acres (1 hectare).

‘While horizontal surface deformations had not previously been considered a signature of sinkholes, the new study shows they can precede sinkhole formation well in advance,’ said Ms Jones.

‘This kind of movement may be more common than previously thought, particularly in areas with loose soil near the surface.’

The Bayou Corne sinkhole formed unexpectedly in 2012 after weeks of minor earthquakes and bubbling natural gas that provoked community concern.

It was caused by the collapse of a sidewall of an underground storage cavity connected to a nearby well operated by Texas Brine Company and owned by Occidental Petroleum.

The sinkhole, which filled with slurry - a fluid mixture of water and pulverised solids - has gradually expanded and now measures about 25 acres (10.1 hectares) and is at least 750 feet (229 metres) deep. It is still growing.

Typically, sinkholes have no natural external surface drainage, and they form through natural processes and human activities.

They occur in regions of terrain where the rock below the surface can be dissolved by groundwater, most commonly in areas with limestone or other carbonate rocks, gypsum or salt beds.

Nasa said continued radar monitoring of the area as recently as October 2013 has shown a widening area of lower ground, with the potential to affect other nearby storage cavities,

Continued growth of the sinkhole threatens the community and Highway 70, so there is a pressing need for reliable estimates of how fast it may expand and how big it may eventually get.

‘This kind of data could be of great value in determining the direction in which the sinkhole is likely to expand,’ said Ms Jones.

‘At Bayou Corne, it appears that material is continuing to flow into the huge cavern that is undergoing collapse.’

Mr Blom says there are no immediate plans to fly radar over sinkhole-prone areas.

‘You could spend a lot of time flying and processing data without capturing a sinkhole,’ he said.

‘Our discovery at Bayou Corne was really serendipitous. But it does demonstrate one of the expected benefits of an InSAR satellite that would image wide areas frequently.’
