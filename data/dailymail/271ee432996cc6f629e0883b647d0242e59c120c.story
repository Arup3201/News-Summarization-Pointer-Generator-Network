Scientists have finally answered the question: is there anybody there?

A spooky experiment which conjured up a ghostly illusion in the laboratory has proved once and for all that it’s only our mind playing tricks.

The invisible, creepy presence reported by so many people over the centuries is just a set of mixed-up signals in the brain.

Artificial 'ghosts' have been conjured up by scientists in an experiment so spooky that two participants asked for it to stop. By having signals mixed up in their brains (shown), volunteers were made to feel that a creepy 'presence' was behind them. They counted up to four phantoms positioned where no-one was standing

The sensation was re-created by researchers using a robot to interfere with the sensory signals in the brains of blindfolded volunteers.

Two volunteers were so unnerved by the feeling of being surrounded by ghosts, they asked for the experiment to stop.

They counted up to four phantoms positioned where no-one was standing - and touching their backs with invisible fingers.

The illusion came from a programmed delay between the brain’s processing of the body’s movements and the body’s position in space.

Whether we are alone in the universe is one of life’s unanswered questions.

But a new poll suggests that the majority of us are convinced aliens exist, and that we're more likely to believe in little green men than God.

According to the research, children in particular are so confident in the existence of extraterrestrial beings that they think family members are aliens in disguise.

The poll of 2,000 adults and children was carried out by Ripley’s Believe It or Not! attraction in London.

Each of the participants were asked to rate how strongly they believed in five supernatural or religious beings including aliens, ghosts, UFOs, angels and God.

Ghosts topped the adult’s list on 55 per cent, followed by aliens on 51 per cent and UFOs on 42 per cent.

God was at the bottom of their list of beliefs on 25 per cent, behind angels on 27 per cent.

Children believed in aliens and ghosts equally (64 per cent), UFOs scored 50 per cent followed by God on 33 per cent. Angels were bottom of this group's list on 27 per cent. 

The interference in the brain was sufficient to make the volunteers believe the signals were no longer from their own bodies - but from someone else.

The findings appear to explain the common experience people have of feeling an unseen presence, even a guardian angel, demon or apparition stalking their movements.

These are frequently reported by people in extreme physical or emotional situations, such as mountaineers and explorers, or those grieving for a lost loved one.

They are also associated with medical conditions that affect the brain, including epilepsy, migraine, schizophrenia and cancer.

Professor Olaf Blanke, who led a team at the Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne (EPFL) in Switzerland, says the research has given up the ghost to science.

He said: ‘Our experiment induced the sensation of a foreign presence in the laboratory for the first time. It shows that it can arise under normal conditions, simply through conflicting sensory-motor signals.

‘The robotic system mimics the sensations of some patients with mental disorders or of healthy individuals under extreme circumstances.

‘This confirms that it is caused by an altered perception of their own bodies in the brain.’

Here an unamed participant takes part in the experiment. The robot made humans feel the illusory presence of a non-existent 'ghost'.


The study was conducted on 12 individuals with various neurological conditions such as epilepsy, stroke, migraine and tumours

The scientists re-created the ‘feelings of presence’ - known as FOP - using a slave robot device that allowed volunteers to control the movements of a jointed mechanical arm with their index fingers.

The movements were translated to another robot arm behind them which touched their backs.

When both the finger-pushing and back-touching occurred at the same time, it created the illusion that the volunteers were caressing their own backs.

That felt weird enough to the blindfolded participants. But something a lot stranger happened when the back-touching was delayed and about 500 milliseconds out of sync with the finger movements.

One in three of the volunteers felt as if they were being watched, and touched, by one or more ghostly presences.

At the same time, they had the disconcerting sensation of drifting backwards, towards the unseen hand.

When questioned, several reported a strong feeling of invisible people being close to them. On average, they counted two, with up to four being reported.

Two of the 12 healthy participants were so disturbed by the experience that they asked the scientists to halt the experiment, the results of which appear in the journal Current Biology.

The scientists say the experiment that what some people believe to be a ghostly presence is just a trick of the brain. ‘This confirms that it is caused by an altered perception of their own bodies in the brain,' said Professor Olaf Blanke of the Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne (EPFL) in Switzerland

Co-author Dr Giulio Rognini, also from the EPFL, said: ‘Our brain possesses several representations of our body in space. Under normal conditions, it is able to assemble a unified self-perception of the self from these representations.

‘But when the system malfunctions because of disease - or, in this case, a robot - this can sometimes create a second representation of one’s own body, which is no longer perceived as ‘me’ but as someone else, a “presence”.’

The researchers describe in the journal the case of mountaineer, Reinhold Messner, who had an FOP experience while descending from the summit of the Himalayan peak Nanga Parbat in June, 1970.

Accompanied by his brother, he was freezing, exhausted and oxygen-starved. He recalled becoming aware of a third climber 'descending with us, keeping a regular distance, a little to my right and a few steps away from me, just outside my field of vision'.

Before conducting the experiment, the researchers carried out brain scans of 12 patients with neurological disorders who had encountered FOPs in the past.

They identified disturbances in three specific brain regions, the insular cortex, parietal-frontal cortex, and temporo-parietal cortex. All were involved in self-awareness, movement, and sense of position in space.
