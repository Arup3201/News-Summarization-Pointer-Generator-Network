DNA tests are being carried out on bones thought to belong to kings and queens from 1,000 years ago, including King Canute.

Experts at Winchester Cathedral are studying the contents of mortuary chests full of bones, which are expected to include those of former Anglo-Saxon and Norman monarchs.

The conservation work at the cathedral had focused on the chests themselves rather than the bones inside them.

But an official cathedral tour guide is thought to let slip to visitors that focus was shifting to analysing the bones.

She told a group of tourists: 'What's happening here is very exciting.

'We've begun work here to look at the DNA of some of our oldest kings.'

Rumours are now circulating that a confidential deal has been signed with a television company to produce a documentary about the work.

However, this was denied by Winchester Cathedral, which attracts 300,000 visitors a year.

King Cynegils, who ruled from 611 to 643 as well as King Cenwalh, King Egbert and King Ethelwulf are all thought to be interred in the caskets.

The bones of King Eadred, King Eadwig, King Canute and his wife Queen Emma of Normandy could also be inside.

If they do belong to ancient kings and queens, they will be the first ancient bones to be discovered since those of Richard III, which were uncovered under a car park in Leicester in 2012.

The work to identify the bones will also be a difficult task as those inside the Cathedral chests are not in order.

In 1642 during the English Civil War, Roundhead troops stormed the cathedral, with the large bones used to smash the building's precious stained glass windows.

When they were gathered up and returned to the chests in 1661, it was not known which bones went together, meaning some might have been mixed up.

They remained in place for 350 years until two years ago when they were moved from the cathedral's quire by the altar to the Lady Chapel in the east of the building.

This is now closed off to visitors as the chests - six in total - are lined up under strong lighting behind a screen while the DNA work is ongoing.

In addition, the bones of Norman monarch King Rufus, who was felled by arrow on August 2, 1100 in the New Forest, are expected to be interred at the cathedral.
