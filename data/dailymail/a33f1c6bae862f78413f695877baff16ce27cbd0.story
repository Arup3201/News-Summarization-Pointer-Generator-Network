Beauty school may sound like something from Grease, but Sephora has made it a reality for us non-professionals with their new University Beauty Classes.

On Sunday, FEMAIL went bare-faced to a Flawless Foundation class at Sephora SoHo in New York City to determine whether the average woman really needs to master the skills usually left to make-up artists.

During the lesson, a team of beauty experts taught us invaluable skills for applying eye cream, concealer and foundation - and unlike your average beauty school, the whole course took just two hours.

Beauty school: On Sunday, FEMAIL went bare-faced to a Flawless Foundation class at Sephora SoHo, where a team of beauty experts instructed us on the correct way to make-up

The class - which had the 
added morning perk of free coffee and breakfast - is one of many that 
are being offered on Sundays at Sephora locations around the country - and it's free 
if you sign up on the website as a 'Beauty Insider'.

After pouring myself a coffee and grabbing a cereal bar, I took my seat at one of the four tables, which were set with clipboards, pens and various cosmetics tools.

The beauty experts introduced themselves, asked us our biggest concerns when it comes to applying foundation and told us how the class would be structured.

Next, we were ushered to the cleansing station, where we wiped off any excess make-up or bacteria before picking out a foundation.

To determine which foundation suits 
your skin, Sephora uses a technology developed by Pantone called Color 
IQ, a kind of camera that identifies exactly what skin tone you are.

Once you have your 'IQ' number, the machine tells you every product in the entire store that matches up with your skin.

Suits your skin: Beauty experts helped me pick out the best moisturizer, eye cream (both from Origins) and foundation (Touche Eclat by Yves Saint Laurent) for my complexion

Instruments: We had a choice of tools for applying foundation - a make-up brush, which is good for a 'buffing' technique, or the Beauty Blender- a hot pink egg-shaped sponge

I was recommended to use Le Teint Touche Eclat, a liquid foundation by Yves Saint Laurent with a golden undertone.

After putting the foundation in my Sephora basket, I was led over to the moisturizer station, where another expert figured out which moisturizer and eye cream I should be using based on my skin sensitivity and concerns.

A helpful tip for applying the 
products came from beauty expert Aneeka, who told us to apply our eye 
cream first to give our eyes 'a chance to plumpen'.

Instead of rubbing it in with your 
forefingers though, she said we should use our ring fingers for the 
lightest amount of pressure, gently dabbing the cream under our eyes and
up to the outside edge of our eyebrows.

Highlighting and contouring: I started, as I was told to, at the top of the ear, and brushed in a downward diagonal motion, stopping two inches below the outside edge of my eye

The art of application: Using a Make-Up Forever palette (pictured), I was given a fan-shaped brush to apply the contouring color

We had a choice of tools for applying foundation - the #55 brush, which is good for a 'buffing' technique, or the Beauty Blender, a hot pink egg-shaped sponge.

I chose the former, and started at the center of my face, as instructed, since that is where the most redness is.

Another useful tip I learned was to 
always keep my foundation brush clean and bacteria-free by wiping it 
with antibacterial soap after each use.

Next
came the most anticipated part of the class - highlighting and 
contouring, a favorite technique among A-listers and fashionistas.

Using a Make-Up Forever palette, I was given a fan-shaped brush to apply the contouring color first.

Make-up masters: Sephora also offers classes on how to do a smoky eye, use colorful eye make-up, put on false eyelashes, transition from day to night eye make-up and learn about skincare

New skill: The two-hour lesson - which ends with a certificate of completion - is one of many that are being offered at Sephora locations around the city - and it's free if you sign up on the website as a 'Beauty Insider'

I
started, as I was told to, at the top of the ear, and brushed in a 
downward diagonal motion, stopping two inches below the outside edge of 
my eye.

For highlighting, which is supposed to add radiance, I used another Touche Eclat product, dabbing it lightly on the top of my cheekbones and the tip of my nose.

One of our beauty experts Juan gave us some memorable highlighting advice. He said to draw 'Chanel Cs' around your eyes, starting under the eyebrows and ending below the eyes.

And to top it all off, he recommended using a finishing spray to set the make-up in place and guarantee that it will last throughout the day.

Upon finishing the class, I was given a 'certificate of completion' from the amazingly friendly SoHo team, which I fully plan on hanging on my wall - as well as adding to my resume.
