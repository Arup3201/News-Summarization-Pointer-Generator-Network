Arrested: Thomas Langenbach, 47, was caught swapping bar codes on boxes of Lego at Target in Cupertino

A top Silicon Valley executive has been switching bar codes on Lego boxes in a scam to buy the toys at huge discounts, according to authorities.

Thomas Langenbach, 47, is vice-president of SAP, a global software company in Palo Alto, California. 

He is expected to be arraigned today on four felony counts of burglary at Santa Clara County Court.

The 47-year-old was being watched by security at several Target stores after his purchases were flagged as suspicious.

On May 8, staff at the Target branch in Cupertino recognised him and placed him under surveillance.

He was caught red-handed covering the store's  labels with his own. When he walked out with a set, which he didn't pay full price for, security apprehended him and called the police.

Langenbach carried out the scam by making his own bar codes using his software skills, according to police.

He would then surreptitiously switch the tags before going to the check-out point. It allowed him to buy a $279 box of Millenium Falcon box for just $49, for example.

Liz Wylie, of Mountain View police, told Mercury News that Langenbach was caught on CCTV performing the scam with expensive Lego kits.

When his multimillion-dollar home in San Carlos was searched by police, they discovered hundreds of Lego boxes stashed inside. The bricks were ordered by size, color and style.

Operation: The tech executive allegedly sold more than 2,000 Lego boxes on eBay for $30,000

The tech executive allegedly sold more than 2,000 items on eBay for around $30,000 under the name 'tomsbrickyard'. Authorities found a bag of pre-made bar codes in Langenbach's car.

He was arrested on May 9 and charged with stealing seven boxes of Lego worth $1,000. He posted $10,000 bail on the same day.

The tech executive's motives were unclear but authorities suggested he may have acted out of 'boredom or compulsion'.

Ms Wylie said: 'In his house, we found hundreds of boxes of unopened Lego sets... The motive was clearly money. Why does he want the money? I don't know. I can think of a million different possible scenarios.'

Baffling: Lagenbach's motive for stealing the Lego was unclear considering he is VP of a multinational tech company and lives in this multimillion dollar home in San Carlos, California

SAP, the software company that the 47-year-old works for, offers a detailed guide on their website how to create bar codes.

Lagenbach has been with SAP since 1988 and moved to the company's Palo Alto base in 2000, according to his LinkedIn profile.

He has a degree in computer science and business administration from Berufsakademie Mannheim university in Germany.
