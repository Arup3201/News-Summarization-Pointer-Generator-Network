Norwegians today began the long and painful process of burying the young victims of last week's bomb and shooting massacre.

As the first funerals were held for the 77 killed  by Anders Breivik - Norwegian police today revised the death toll UP by one victim - Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg told a memorial service in Oslo: 'Today it is one week since Norway was hit by evil.

'The bullets hit our young, but they also struck an entire nation. We have to live with July 22, but together we will make it.'

First in a long line: Bano Rashid was said to have devoted her life to fighting racism

Speaking from a stage adorned with red roses, the symbol of the governing Labour Party, he called the massacre an 'attack on democracy'.

Flags around the nation flew at half mast to mark the day a week ago when Breivik set off a bomb in central Oslo that killed eight people followed by the shooting of 69 people, mostly Labour Party youth members, at a summer camp on the island of Utoya.

Today police revised upwards the death toll from last Friday's terrorist attacks to 77 after an unidentified victim died at a hospital of wounds suffered during the shooting rampage on Utoya island.

The first to be buried today was 18-year-old Bano Rashid, a Muslim girl originally from Kurdistan, who was the leader of the Labour 
Party's youth wing in Nesodden, near Oslo.

Bano, whose younger sister survived the massacre, was said to have dedicated her life to 
fighting for democracy and against racism.

Norway's Foreign Minister Jonas Gahr Stoere attended her funeral in 
Nesodden.

'We have to stand united and carry 
their dreams forward,' Nesodden mayor Christian Holm said of Bano and 
another Nesodden youth, Diderik Aamodt Olsen, who also died in the 
attacks.

Bano's mother said: 'The answer must not be hatred, but even more love.'

Another victim, 19-year-old Ismail Haji Ahmed, was being buried at Hamar, in the south-west of Norway.

Killer Breivik meanwhile was today facing his second interrogation since his bombing and shooting spree.This morning he was escorted by armed guards from his jail to police headquarters in Oslo.

The day after the atrocities in the 
Norwegian capital and on the island of Utoya last Friday, Breivik was 
questioned for seven hours, and another long interrogation is expected.

In
a speech at the People's House, Labour Party youth-wing leader Eskil 
Pedersen said the gunman attacked Norway's core values, such as 
democracy, tolerance and fighting racism.

'Long before he stands before a court
we can say: he has lost,' Pedersen said. He vowed that the youth 
organisation would return to Utoya island - where the shootings occurred
- next year for its annual summer gathering, a tradition that stretches
back decades.

Another memorial service was being held at a mosque in an immigrant district of Oslo.

Norway's
police said today that all those killed in the terror attacks have 
been identified and that those who had been reported missing have been 
accounted for.

The Prime Minister has urged his 
increasingly diverse Nordic nation to show unity at the services in the 
face of the deadliest assault on his country during peacetime.

Norwegian
news agency NTB said that Breivik was picked up at a 
jail today and transported to police headquarters in Oslo for a session
of questioning.

Investigators
believe the 32-year-old Norwegian acted alone, after years of 
meticulous planning, and haven't found anything to support his claims 
that he's part of an anti-Muslim militant network plotting a series of 
coups d'etat across Europe.

Breivik was questioned for seven hours on Saturday, the day after the twin attacks targeting the government district of Oslo and the youth camp of the Prime Minister's left-leaning Labor Party on the island north-west of the capital.

He admitted to carrying out the attacks but has pleaded not guilty to terror charges, saying he is in a state of war, according to his lawyer and police.

Police have charged Breivik with terrorism, which carries a maximum sentence of 21 years in prison.

However, it is possible the charge 
will change during the investigation to crimes against humanity, which 
carries a 30-year prison term, Norway's top prosecutor Tor-Aksel Busch 
said.

'Such charges will be considered when
the entire police investigation has been finalised,' he said. 'It is an
extensive investigation. We will charge Breivik for each individual 
killing.'

A formal indictment isn't expected until next year, Mr Busch said.

Breivik says his murderous rampage was an attempt to save the Western 
world from Muslim colonisation. He tried to justify the massacre in a 
1,500-page anti-immigrant manifesto.

His lawyer has said he considers himself a 'saviour' and that it is likely he is insane.
