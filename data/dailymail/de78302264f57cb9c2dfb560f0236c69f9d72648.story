A 27 stone woman who was too scared to have a bath for  20 years has spoken of her joy at getting her life back - after losing more than half her body weight.

Linda Pearson, 62, feared her huge size 38 frame would get trapped in the tub.

But the mother-of-two shed a 16 stone and 13 dress sizes and is now a slim size 12.

She now regularly enjoys 10 mile hikes – something that would have been unheard of before - and is no longer afraid to have a bath. 

Linda Pearson shed 16 stone and 13 sizes after she became utterly ashamed and depressed about her weight

She said: 'Before I lost the weight, I had had to lean on a trolley to do my shopping because I got so out of breath.

'Or, I'd make sure I brought everything I needed downstairs at the start of the day so I didn't have to go up again, because I knew I wouldn't have the puff.

‘Now I’ve climbed Mount Snowdon.’

Mrs Pearson, from Leeds, said the battle with her weight began after the births of her daughters, Melanie, now 38, and Lisa, 40.

She said: 'I've always been on the big side, but not so much that I would worry about it. 

'But after the girls were born, the weight just piled on. 

'My problem was portion control and my love of chocolate. I could eat five bars at once when I had a craving.

'I tried diet after diet, but while the weight would come off in the short term, afterwards I’d treat myself and put back on what I had lost plus more.'

By the time her daughters were adults, Mrs Pearson weighed 27 stone and wore a size 38, which she had buy from specialists online.

'My husband Jerry has always been slim and by that point one of him could have fitted in one leg of my trousers,' she recalled. 

The turning point came when the couple went on holiday to Cyprus in 2010.

Mrs Pearson said: 'Jerry really wanted to go abroad and we hadn't been for several years so I felt it wouldn't be fair to say no.

'But I really didn't want to go. I knew it would be hot and that wasn't good for someone of my size.

‘It was bad enough during summer in the UK. Just walking down the street I’d be dripping in sweat.’

The plane journey alone left her with bruised knees from being squeezed so tightly against the passenger seat in front.

Once at their apartment, both the heat and shame left Mrs Pearson a prisoner in her room.

She said: 'I never left the apartment during the day for the whole two weeks we were there. 

'I only went out to eat when it was dark. I didn’t want people to see me and stare.

‘I felt so down and guilty because my husband was off sightseeing on his own. I vowed then that I would never go on holiday again as a super morbidly obese person.

‘There were no photos of either of us from the whole holiday which is really sad. Jerry would come back in the evening and say what he’d been up to on his own.

‘It was utterly miserable and I knew I had to do something about it.'

Having seen a TV programme on weight loss surgery, on her return Mrs Pearson called her GP about it.

‘I was so ashamed and felt so guilty my husband had spent our holiday on his own, I phoned a week after we got back.

'I thought if I didn’t do something, my life would be very short. 

I felt that surgery was the only long term option so that I could enjoy my life with my daughters and grandchildren.'

During an appointment at a private clinic, the consultant suggested she think about a gastric bypass, given her history of failed diets and problems with portion control. 

But it certainly wasn't an easy option she took lightly.

'I knew there was a chance I might not come around from the anaesthetic - even though things are much more sophisticated for larger people now,' Mrs Pearson said. 

Ashamed at her weight and fearing she would die early, Mrs Pearson sought help for her weight. After losing three stone naturally, she underwent a gastric bypass - and has since lost 16 stone overall 

She credits her success with an online weight loss forum, which gives dieters advice. She said: I live a life I only ever dreamed of and have so much to look forward to'

'But I was determined to go ahead. I even lost three stone before the operation to be safer in surgery and prove how committed I was to making a change. 

'Even though I lost that, I didn’t dream of cancelling the surgery, I knew I couldn’t do it all naturally.’ 

After being discharged home, Mrs Pearson used the charity website, Weight Loss Surgery Info, as well as forums, for advice and encouragement.

‘I could only eat liquids for weeks, it’s like weaning a baby,’ she explained. 

‘By week eight, I was on solids but could only have soft food, like stews or salmon. 

It was so tough but great not feeling I was doing it on my own. 

'If I had any problem I knew there would be someone out there who had gone, or was going, through the same thing.'

After a year, Mrs Pearson had lost 10 stone. Another year on, she has now lost another two and is a size 12-14 - a drop of 13 dress sizes.

Feeling fit, the grandmother climbed to the summit of Mount Snowdon, raising £500 for the weight loss charity which supported her through her journey.

'The bypass has changed my life and the charity helped me an awful lot,’ she said. ‘By raising funds for them, I hope I can help them help others like the old me.

‘Looking at photos of me back then, it’s hard to believe I’ve climbed a mountain and go on nine or 10 mile walks every weekend.

‘I live a life I only ever dreamed of and have so much to look forward to.

‘Jerry and the girls are really proud.

‘One of the best things of all is being able to have a lovely soak in the bath at the end of the day.

'For 20 years I was worried I'd get trapped so I steered clear. Not anymore. I love life.’
