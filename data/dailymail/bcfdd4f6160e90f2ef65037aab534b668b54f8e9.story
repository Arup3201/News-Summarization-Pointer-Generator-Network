Brutal attack: Steven Frogg has been jailed for 16 years after attempting to kill a four-year-old because he thought he 'turned into a demon'

An unemployed drunk who tried to murder a four-year-old boy in a frenzied knife attack because he thought the child 'turned into a demon' has been jailed for 16 years today.

The victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was found in a pool of blood after he was stabbed multiple times on Easter Monday, in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, last year.

Police found Steven Frogg, 52, drunk and watching children's 
television in his flat wearing blood-stained clothes and with the blade 
and handle of a large kitchen knife lying nearby.

Neighbours had alerted police and paramedics after they spotted the wounded boy in the street.

He underwent emergency surgery for knife wounds to his head, neck, shoulder and both sides of his lower torso.

The victim has made a good recovery but remains haunted by 'nightmares' about the attack.

Frogg admitted attempted murder at Nottingham Crown Court.

He claimed he picked up the knife to protect himself after the boy had appeared to him to have taken the form of a demon.

The court heard the boy's father had left him with Frogg, while he went to a corner shop to buy food for their lunch.

When the father last saw his son he was happily playing with kittens Frogg had at his home.

The boy's parents are separated and he had been due to return to his mother on the day he was stabbed after spending a week with his father.

The father had moved to his new home seven weeks before the attack and had befriended several of his neighbours, including Frogg.

John Lloyd-Jones, prosecuting, told the court: 'The boy's father had left his son in the care of the defendant playing with kittens while he went shopping.'

The prosecutor said the attack was an 'abuse of trust' by the defendant.

Mr Lloyd-Jones added: 'The boy has made a very good recovery physically but mentally doesn't forget this incident and still has nightmares.'

Nicholas Dean, defending, said of Frogg: 'He was a man who was previously inoffensive, gentle and reclusive who suddenly behaved in a bizarre and most frightening manner that is clearly in need ofexplanation. He claims that the boy had turned into a demon.

'He is a man of previous good character. He is someone who is genuinely puzzled by what he did.'

Speaking at the time of the attack the victim's father told how he had left his animal-loving son, who he described as 'bright and sprightly', at Frogg's house playing with kittens while he went to buy tinned ravioli and bread for lunch.

'I had only been gone ten minutes. As I was walking home police cars and an ambulance came rushing down the street. I thought "crikey, someone's in serious trouble",' he said.

'A neighbour came up to me and told me something had happened to my boy and he had already been taken to hospital.'

Passing sentence Judge Michael Stokes, QC, described the boy as 'lovely'.

'This was a child of four, bleeding as he was, screaming as he was, and you shut the door on him. Ten minutes later you called 999 claiming you had been attacked.

'The effects have been devastating, leaving markedly visible scars not to mention serious psychological damage. He is frightened of stairs, he sleepwalks, he suffers dreadful nightmares, all because of you.'

Detective Sergeant Phil Sims said after: 'This was a frenzied and unthinkable attack on a very young child who thought he was safe in Frogg's care.

'Frogg not only inflicted a series of horrific injuries on the boy, but also left him for dead on the pavement right outside his flat.

'Thankfully the boy survived the attack and has since recovered but he carries scars both physically and psychologically. He is young and so I hope he has little memory of the events of that day, but I have no doubt his family, those members of the public who went to his aid, and the paramedics and police officers who attended the scene, will struggle to forget what they were faced with that day.'
