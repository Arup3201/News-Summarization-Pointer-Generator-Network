Socialite Tina McPhee, cofounder of drink company Juice revolution, will remain behind bars until at least 2023 after Adelaide judge Simon Stretton sentenced her this morning over 181 counts of 'callous', 'appalling' and 'extreme' fraud.

Ms McPhee, 40, plead guilty to thieving from a number of vulnerable victims - including four children - and bagging nearly $3.9 million in the process.

The former AMP financial adviser stole from a number of clients, including brain damaged car accident victims, while working as their trustee.

Instead of using the money for the benefit of the people she was supposed to be working for, McPhee spent it on 'shopping sprees ', holidays to America and Europe, and 'massive amounts' of fashion and jewellery.

She told court she experienced 'sexual difficulties' as a child, which the judge took into account in sentencing, but was slapped with at least a decade in jail (including time served since last July) for her slew of jaw-dropping crimes. 

'It is difficult to conceive of a worse or more serious breach of trust than you’ve committed,' judge Stretton said in the Adelaide district court on Friday morning.

'You are a callous, dishonest, morally bankrupt woman whose behaviour is an affront to the principles of the trust you undertook to fulfill. Your actions are an affront to the victims themselves and to the community at large.'

Earlier in the trial prosecutor Simon LePoidevin told court: 'She lived the life of Walter Mitty funded by the suffering of her vulnerable victims.'

McPhee's sentence was reduced from 16 years to 13 years (10 years non-parole) due to her early pleas of guilty.

'Your breaches of trust in the particular circumstances of this case were extreme,' said judge Stretton.

'The victims and the community expect that the law will do all it can to deter this kind of outrageously dishonest and amoral conduct, particularly where the victims are injured and defenceless people left without resources as a result.'

Four of McPhee's youngest victims were awarded nearly $500,000 after their parents died in a car crash.

'Rather than act honestly as trustee, almost from the outset you embarked on a relentless calculated campaign to steal, misuse and dissipate the victims’ compensation moneys,' judge Stretton said of the theft of the children.

McPhee has stared in a number of racy ads for her juice company, featuring the South Australian nude and covered only by apples and leafy vegetables.
