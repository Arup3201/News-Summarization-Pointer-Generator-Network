An inflatable vest designed to make people feel like they are being hugged could help autistic people stay calm in stressful situations.

The Â£245 Squease jackets could also calm screaming babies, and are inflated by pressing a pressure bulb in the lining.

The jackets are available as a hooded top, or as a bulletproof-vest-esque top to be worn under clothing.

'Squease is an inflatable pressure vest that is hidden away inside a hooded top. No weights are used; hug-like pressure is applied to to the upper body simply by inflating the vest with air,' say its designers.

650,000 people in the UK suffer from autistic spectrum disorders.

Sufferers can panic when in situations where they might be overwhelmed by senses such as sound and smells.

'For people with sensory processing difficulties such as many people with
autism, who find dealing with change, busy environments or contact with
other people to be highly stressful, applying pressure to the upper 
body may be calming, increase body awareness or improve attention and 
focus,' say its makers.

A video on the Essex designers' site shows off that it could even be used on babies.

The vest is lightweight and may be worn by itself or zipped inside a Squease hooded top, making it discreet and mobile.

'The vest is inflated by squeezing a hand pump, allowing the wearer to regulate and apply soothing pressure in everyday situations that may lead to anxiety, stress or sensory overload - whether that is at home, at school, or on-the-move,' say its makers.
