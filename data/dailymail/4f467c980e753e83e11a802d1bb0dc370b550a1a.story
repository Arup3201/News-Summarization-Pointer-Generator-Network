Common sense tells us that people with similar personality traits tend to flock together, and according to a new study, the same principle holds true for Americans living in different parts of the U.S.

Research conducted by Dr Peter J. Rentfrow, of the University of Cambridge, has revealed that Americans living in the north-central Great Plains and the South tend to be conventional and friendly; those who reside in the Western and Eastern seaboards can be described as relaxed and creative, while New England and Mid-Atlantic dwellers are prone to being temperamental and uninhibited.

The study dividing the map of the U.S. into three regions marked by distinct personalities was published online October 14 by the American Psychological Association’s Journal of Personality and Social Psychology.

Age-old stereotypes: A new study has revealed that Americans living in the north-central Great Plains and the South tend to be conventional and friendly, but also fairlt poor and less educated

Free spirits: Those who reside in coastal states like California and Oregon can be described as relaxed and creative

The scientists looked at the personality traits of more than 1.5milion Americans from 48 states and Washington DC by asking willing participants of various online surveys and Facebook to answer questions about their character traits and demographic factors, including their place of residence.

After 12 years spent collecting data, the researchers were able to identify three psychological profiles based on five broad dimensions of personality, known as the Big Five — openness, conscientiousness, extroversion, agreeableness and neuroticism.

When the research team juxtaposed the results of the study with the map of the U.S., they detected distinct psychological profiles associated with three geographic regions.

‘These national clusters of personalities also relate to a region’s politics, economy, social attitudes and health,’ Rentfrow said in a press release.

The study found that people who live in the friendly and conventional states like Minnesota and South Dakota tend to be poorer, less educated, more politically conservative and less healthy compared to people in other parts of the country.

The research was led by Dr Peter J. Rentfrow, of the University of Cambridge, and the study was published online by the American Psychological Association's Journal of Personality and Social Psychology

Americans who reside in relaxed and creative states, such as California and Oregon, are more ethnically and culturally diverse, more liberal in their political persuasions, tend to have more money, higher level of education and better health in comparison to dwellers of other states.

The temperamental and uninhibited portion of the U.S., which includes New York and Massachusetts, has more female residents and people who are older and wealthier. They also tend to be more liberal in their political views.

The researchers also calculated an average value for each of the Big Five personality traits for each state, according to LiveScience. 

According to a chart presenting the findings, Washington DC residents are the least agreeable, followed by New Yorkers in close second.

Wisconsinites were the most extroverted, while those who call Maine their home were the least conscientious.

Colorado was revealed to be the least neurotic state, while DC residents distinguished themselves by the degree of their openness.
