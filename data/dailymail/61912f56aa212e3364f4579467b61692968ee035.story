She's got a no-nonsense approach to buying homes. And Kirstie Allsopp has the same hard-line attitude when it comes to parenting.

When children eventually leave home, she believes the number one rule is that they call their parents at least once a week.

The star, 43, revealed she has also made a deal with all her children that if they take a gap year before university, they do some ‘proper work, it’s not a year off’.

In return, she and her partner Ben Andersen, 55, will fund their courses.

Miss Allsopp said she thinks many parents are guilty of spoiling their children and are afraid to set them boundaries to live by.

She revealed she insists on kisses at the school gates from Bay, eight, and Oscar, six. 

And she also expects that they and their stepbrothers Hal, 14, and Orion, 11, will do work experience as it means they enter the workplace with the correct social skills.

Miss Allsopp said: ‘I think we’ve spoilt our kids too much – we’ve allowed them to go months without calling their parents' 

Miss Allsopp – who is best known for co-presenting Channel 4’s Location, Location, Location – blamed poor child rearing for a lack of respect for the elderly in this country.

Speaking at the Handmade Fair with Hobbycraft which is on at Hampton Court Palace until tomorrow, she said: ‘I think we’ve spoilt our kids too much – we’ve allowed them to go months without calling their parents. It’s not unreasonable to expect children to ring their parents once a week.

‘Older people mustn’t think they’re a burden and they must call their kids and the children should call their parents. We must respect the older generation and set store by their opinion, otherwise it will happen to us. 

'We have a duty to our parents to stay in touch, and see them and know them and understand them.’
