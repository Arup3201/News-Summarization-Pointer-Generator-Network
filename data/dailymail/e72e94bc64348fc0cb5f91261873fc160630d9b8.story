Ms Veloso received harrowing news in January when Indonesian president Joko Widodo rejected her plea for clemency, according to Indonesian press reports.

The nation's Attorney-General Muhammad Prasetyo has said preparations were complete for the executions of 10 death row detainees, including Ms Veloso and Chan and Sukumuran.  

'Everything had to be organised first before transferring the prisoners because we do not want them to be in the isolation cells for too long [before their execution],' Prasetyo told reporters.  

Ms Veloso is the only woman among the list of detainees slated for execution, which includes the Australians and Nigerian national Raheem Agbaje Salami, 45.

Vigils have been held across the Philippines and the country's government was engaged in a lobbying effort to have her case reviewed, Rappler.com reported.  

Chan and Sukumuran arrived at Nusakambangan, where the executions will take place, on Wednesday afternoon. 

Ms Veloso appeared at an Indonesian case review hearing on Tuesday, according to the Jakarta Post. 

There, her lawyers reportedly argued she had not been able to understand the trial that led to her execution because of incompetent translation. 

A photograph of Ms Veloso at court published by the Jakarta Post on Wednesday featured the caption: 'No mercy'.
