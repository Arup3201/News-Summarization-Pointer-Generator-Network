A Manchester United footballer offered a student £10,000 for a threesome with a team-mate.

Brazil star Andreas Pereira had asked Kelly McKinney for sex in a  text and then suggested that his first team friend Paddy McNair join them.

In a series of lewd messages Pereira said they would pay her £5,000 each, 'if u do it well', but Miss McKinney was disgusted and refused.

Cash deal: Brazil star Andreas Pereira met Kelly McKinney, right, at the Manchester United Christmas party, left, and then offered to pay her £10,000 for a threesome with a friend

Messages: These texts show how Pereira said he and first team friend Paddy McNair would pay £5,000 each for sex

She told The Sun: 'I nearly fell off my chair when he offered me £10,000 for a threesome. What kind of low-life does that? I'm not that kind of person at all and found it very, very insulting.

'He's clearly desperate and struggling to find anyone that he doesn't have to pay for a sex'.

There is no evidence that Mr McNair knew of, or was involved in sending the messages from Pereira's phone. 

Miss McKinney said she met Pereira at the Manchester United Christmas party and was invited to the VIP area to drink with the other players.

She described Pereira and McNair as being like 'naughty schoolboys' and said later the footballer tracked her down on Twitter and they then exchanged numbers.

But the messages soon turned towards sex and he asked: 'U want to do something next week me u and paddy?'

She then asked what he meant and he replied: 'Threesome. Will take care of u. U want? How much. Tell me. We were ready to pay 5each.'

After she refused he then texted again to say he and Paddy McNair wanted to meet her for sex and she asked: 'Just you?' and he replies: '1 friend'.

Friends: Pereira said that his team-mate Paddy McNair, right, was keen to meet Miss McKinney for sex but there is no evidence Mr McNair was involved in sending the messages

Born in Belgium, Pereira has represented Brazil at U20 level and plays regularly for United U21s but is struggling to make an impression on Louis Van Gaal who is well stocked in that position.

Pereira made his debut for United's first team, coming on as a substitute in their 4-0 Capital One Cup defeat to MK Dons early this season

The 19-year-old is unlikely to sign a new contract at Old Trafford and is poised to leave in the summer - and may now me in trouble with the club's manager Louis van Gaal.

Last night his agent Leo Scheinkman said: 'He is young and single and can have sex with whoever he wants. What does he have to apologise for?'
