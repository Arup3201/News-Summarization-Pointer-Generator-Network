A schoolboy is believed to have killed himself after being accused of raping a girl when he told police about drug dealers in his town.

Tom Acton, 16, became the victim of cruel taunts and was attacked by Thomas Greenwood, 18, when the lies started spreading in Poynton, Cheshire.

He was due to give evidence at Greenwood's trial but was found critically ill at home days before the court hearing at Crewe Magistrates' Court.

Tom was attacked in the street, targeted 
on Facebook and angry youths turned up at his house as lies spread that 
he had tied a girl to a tree and raped her.

Death: Tom Acton (left), 16, gave information to police about people dealing drugs to youngsters. Days after his death he was due to testify in court against one of his tormentors, 18-year-old Thomas Greenwood (right)

Before he was attacked, Tom moved to Wales briefly to live with his grandmother for his own safety, but was set upon by Greenwood - who can be named after a judge lifted reporting restrictions - who told him 'you are dead.

It said: 'He threatened to break my 
nose and said: "If I see you, you are dead". I screamed for my life and I
 saw him just staring me out. I thought my life was going to end.'

He
 added that the bullying campaign by Greenwood's friends then increased.
 'He started rumours that I'd raped girls', he said. 'It boils down to 
the fact that I got on better with girls and he didn't like it.

'There
 were rumours that I had tied a girl to a tree, raped her and took 
pictures. As you can imagine I can no longer walk down the street as 
everyone calls me a rapist.

'I
 felt so scared for my life I wanted to break down and cry. I was scared
 to go out of the house. I wish I wasn't here. No one has the right or 
authority to assault me, cause me harm.

'I suffered no physical injury just redness it is more of a mental injury caused.' Greenwood
 was convicted of assault but cleared of possessing a bladed article and
 will be sentenced at a later date.

Angry: Gaynor Acton, Tom's mother (pictured together, left), has criticised authorities for failing to act to protect her son and accused them of turning a blind eye. Some of his injuries after being attacked are pictured (right)

Tom's 45-year-old mother, Gaynor, has hit out at authorities for failing to act to protect her son and accused them of turning a blind eye over fears it would shame the local area.

She said: 'The first time I knew about
 it was when I had to peel Tom off the floor after he had his head 
smashed against the wall. The rumour went all over the place and on 
Facebook and Tom went to live with his gran in Wales for a bit.

'Tom became a recluse in his own house. It was horrific. He was screaming and crying asking why were they doing it'

Gaynor Acton, Tom's mother

'Straightaway
 I called the school and police but they said there was nothing they 
could do about it. They said it was just a rumour and that Facebook is 
their bane.

'Tom became a recluse in his own house. It was horrific. He was screaming and crying asking why were they doing it.'

She also described how he would have 
to be dropped off at school even though it was just a 10-minute walk and
 how a gang of 30 came to the door saying they wanted 'to get rid of the
 vermin'.

Speaking
 at a parish council meeting, she said: 'My son Tom died in
 tragic circumstances at home.

'What you won't know is that he had given 
information to police about drug dealers in Poynton.

'He
 was bullied, pressured and then threatened. Poynton was not a safe 
place for Tom. We tried to take the issue to the authorities but were 
not taken seriously. I came to the council in April for help and you did
 nothing.'

Claims: False rumours began circulating around Poynton (file picture) and on Facebook that wrongly alleged Tom had tied a girl to a tree before sexually assaulted her

Investigation: Tests are being conducted to establish Tom's cause of death. The teenager died on October 31

Crewe
 Magistrates' Court heard that Tom was attacked outside his home by 
Greenwood in June. His statement was read to the court in which he 
described how Greenwood held what he thought was a knife to his throat.

A text conversation between him and a
 girl read: 'I have been after him for ages. I pulled up in the car got 
out, banged his head against the wall and then hit him in the face a few
 times.'

'I can no longer walk down the 
street as everyone calls me a rapist. I felt so scared for my life I 
wanted to break down and cry. I was scared to go out of the house'

Tom Acton

In court he denied making death threats and claimed not to know about the false rape allegations.

Yesterday, Mrs Acton said: 'I want people suffering what Tom suffered to have the confidence to speak out.

'Ours
 is a middle-class area and is supposed to be safer than safe yet I 
believe that means the community is too frightened to speak out when 
something goes wrong.

'It's 
not the image those in authority in Poynton want to portray. When Tom 
died we had over 200 cards with everyone saying what a good friend he 
was and how he would help everyone - but no one was there to help him in
 his darkest hours.

Education: Tom attended Poynton High School (file picture) and was described as a talented footballer

'He 
would always fight and had a strong sense of justice, and if somebody 
was being bullied he would always be the first one there to help them. 
But at the time he was very worried about the trial of Thomas Greenwood 
and he said it would be the end of him.

Local area: Tests are being conducted to establish his cause of death but there are no suspicious circumstances

'He
 was very apprehensive about going to court and frightened that he might
 be threatened. If he did see the bullies they would make gestures 
across the neck.

'They were 
like a pack of wolves hounding a wounded animal. Tom was very brave, he 
was even an organ donor at the age of eight after he had seen a donor 
card in mine and his dad's wallets.

'I
 didn't know until he was dying that he had signed up when he was eight 
and signed up again when he was 16. Little did we know six months later 
he would be giving them away.'

Cheshire Constabulary Inspector Steve Griffiths told MailOnline: ‘We would like to take the opportunity to offer our condolences to the family following the tragic death of Tom.

‘Macclesfield Police works closely with the school and the local council with information given about drugs being considered and acted on if appropriate. As a result of information received regarding drug dealing we had launched an investigation which is currently ongoing.

‘An allegation of assault was also made by Tom in relation to a separate issue not related to drugs and this resulted in an 18-year-being charged and he is currently going through the court process so it would not be appropriate to comment further at this stage.

‘Cheshire Police takes illegal drug 
activity seriously and this is reflected in on-going investigations such
 as Operation Dizi which has seen a large number of drug dealers from 
the Macclesfield area brought to justice.

‘This operation continues and could not 
be carried out without the help of the public who give us information 
about drug activity in their community.

Probe: Tom - seen in December 2012 (left) and August this year (right) - is believed to have committed suicide

‘Anyone who gives information to police 
regarding any crime and feels they are being threatened are dealt with 
sensitively and there are procedures in place to advise and protect 
them.

'An
 application by the investigating officer had been made for special 
measures to support mum and Tom in relation to the assault 
investigation.’

Tom is believed to have committed suicide. Tests are being conducted to establish a cause of death, but there are no suspicious circumstances.

David 
Waugh, headmaster at the mixed comprehensive Poynton High School, said: 'We have been stunned by
 the loss of a member of our community and continue to express our 
deepest sympathy.

'We 
continue to provide the highest of educational standards in every aspect
 of our school life, within a framework of outstanding care, guidance 
and support.

'It would not 
be appropriate to comment directly on any of the issues raised while 
various reviews and legal processes are being followed.'
