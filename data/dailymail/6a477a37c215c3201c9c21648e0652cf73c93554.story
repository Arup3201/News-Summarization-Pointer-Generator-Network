'We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard.'

These were the famous words spoken by President John F Kennedy at Rice University on 12 September 1962 challenging America to land on the moon - which they did, nearly seven years later.

And now that moment, along with many other historical and current audio clips from Nasa's space exploration and science endeavours, can be heard on a SoundCloud account from the agency. 

Washington-based Nasa has released dozens of clips on SoundCloud (screenshot shown). They range from moments in space exploration to scientific noises. It includes Armstrong's first words from the lunar surface and JFK's 'we choose to go to the moon speech'

The collection of Nasa sounds ranges from pivotal moments in space exploration to fascinating sounds elsewhere in the universe.

The short clips include Armstrong's immortal 'one small step for man,' but also some other lesser-heard sounds.

When on Nasa’s Soundcloud page, it might not be immediately clear how to download a track. 

There are single tracks at the bottom that have a download arrow, which can clicked to download them.

To download one of the tracks in the album lists, however, you need to click on the list’s name to navigate to its specific page.

Here, you can then download each individual tracks from that clicked album by scrolling over them, which makes the download arrow appear.

This includes the beep of the Soviet satellite Sputnik 1, the first man-made object ever to orbit Earth.

And there's also the sound of a Space Shuttle launching and even noises from a distant star made from scientific data - as sound does not travel in space. 

While many of the sounds were available before, this account provides an easy way to access a varied number of them.

They can be shared with others on social networks, or even downloaded to perhaps be used as a ringtone.

'You can hear the memorable words "Houston, we've had a problem," every time you make an error on your computer,' Nasa jokes on their page. 

Above you can listen to some audio clips from the Apollo missions including the crew of Apollo 8 wishing Earth a Merry Christmas as they circled the moon in December 1968 and of course Neil Armstrong's words spoken from the lunar surface on 20 July 1969

The impressive noise of a J-2X engine being fired - to be used on Nasa's upcoming Space Launch System rocket - is one of the rocket noises on offer.

Elsewhere you can hear data recorded by the Voyager spacecraft and later converted into sound - such as lightning on Jupiter or interstellar plasma sounds.

Several Space Shuttle noises are available, including the sound of the landing gear dropping and a roaring liftoff.

There are also several sounds from the Mercury series of space flights - Nasa's inaugural human spaceflight programme - and of course JFK's famous speech.

Another clip is from the moment just after Armstrong and Aldrin landed on the surface of the moon on 20 July 1969.

'Houston, Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed,' says Armstrong, 18 seconds after landing. 

'Roger, Tranquility. We copy you on the ground. You got a bunch of guys about to turn blue. We're breathing again. Thanks a lot,' replies the Capsule Communicator (Capcom) Charlie Duke.

The audio clips will be a nostalgic reminder for some, and an educational experience for others.
