Imagine swimming for more than seven hours straight - now imagine doing it without any arms or legs in shark and jellyfish infested waters.

That's the incredible achievement of gutsy Frenchman Phillipe Croizon who had to have his lower limbs amputated when he suffered a freak 20,000 volt accident in 1994.

The 43-year-old father-of-two battled against strong currents and tides to cross the 12 mile stretch of water between Oceania and Asia to complete the first stage of his mission to symbolically link the world's continents.

After setting off from a fishing village named Wutung in Papua New Guinea he arrived at Pasar Skow in Indonesia seven hours, 35 minutes and 35 seconds later to be met by 100 villagers in tribal costumes yesterday.

Back on dry land an exhausted Mr Croizon told an Agence France Presse ‘It was very, very hard.

'We took an hour and a half more than scheduled because of adverse currents.

‘I had to swim slowly because we had not reconnoitred the waters beforehand. We only received authorisation from the Indonesian authorities on Wednesday evening which left it too late.'

Philippe was was joined by countryman and long distance sea swimmer Arnaud Chassery along with 29-year-old Wutung inhabitant Zet Zampa.

Making a splash: Croizon rests on the shore in the coastal village of Pasar Skow located in Indonesia after completing his swim from Oceania to Asia which took seven-and-a-half hours in May

He was also accompanied by a Zodiac dinghy on his swim and during the journey he came across both sharks and giant jellyfish.

The limbless Frenchman first attracted worldwide attention after swimming across the English Channel two years ago in a time of just over 13 hours.

He will embark on the second stage of his round the world challenge next month when he attempts to swim the 15 miles from Jordan’s Gulf of Aqaba in Asia to the Egyptian coast in Africa.

Stage three, in July, will see him try and cross from Africa to Europe via the Straits of Gibraltar. The final stage in August will be across the freezing waters of the Bering Straits from an island in Russia to one in Alaska, U.S.

No stopping him: Papuan villagers look on as Mr Croizon approaches the shore. The Frenchman lost his limbs when he suffered a 20,000 volt electric shock accident

New friends: The French swimmer is joined by scores of Papuan residents. He has now completed two stages of his mission to swim between each of the world's continents

To achieve the swims he uses specially adapted artificial legs fitted with giant flippers.

The former electrical engineer lost the use of his lower limbs 18 years ago at the age of 26 when he suffered 20,000 volt electric shocks while changing a TV aerial.

It is believed the first shock stopped his heart beating, while the second actually jolted it back into action and saved his life.

Over a period of several months surgeons attempted to save his limbs but were eventually forced to amputate his arms and legs. 

A keen sportsman prior to his accident Philippe spent months in hospital followed by years of physical re-education. He has battled depression and despondency to return to the world of sporting achievement.
