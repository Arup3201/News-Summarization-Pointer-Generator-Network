England’s players have gone home but the Premier League is still well represented in Brazil. 42 players from the league are still involved, more than the Bundesliga (25), Serie A (18), Ligue 1 (16) and La Liga (15).

Flying the flag: Holland captain Robin van Persie is one of 42 Premier League star still in Brazil

Stay away, Monsieur

French president Francois Hollande will not follow the example of other leaders and hot-foot it to the World Cup this week. Hollande, who has been considered an unlucky charm after going to two poor games in the run-up to the tournament, has promised to stay away.

Colombian president Juan Manuel Santos has celebrated his country’s progression by declaring today a public holiday for all government workers. Perhaps England will do the same at the next World Cup. Best make it one of the group games though…

World Cup fever: Colombia's performances have led to their president declaring a national holiday

Keep it down please

The Dutch and Costa Rica sides going to Salvador would be advised to stay away from the city’s popular Sheraton Hotel. The nearby military band who have been annoying guests with early morning practices were playing the Brazilian national anthem at 7am on Thursday!

Whole new ball game

The World Cup has a worldwide influence and it’s even having an impact on golf. Next year’s WGC Match Play Championship will use a similar format, with 64 players split into groups of four — playing each other once — before advancing.

No side who banned their players from sex at the World Cup — Spain, Russia, Bosnia, Chile and Mexico among them — made it to the quarter-finals.

Impotent: Spain flew home early from Brazil after a disastrous World Cup campaign

Poor Pablo pranked

If Colombia’s Pablo Armero looks a little shaken against Brazil, we know why. His team-mates Juan Cuadrado and James Rodriguez hid behind the curtain in his hotel room before jumping out on their victim, prompting him to drop his drink in fright.

France’s Paul Pogba has been a hit on and off the pitch. His Twitter following has increased more than any player, jumping 505 per cent to 830,000.

The people of Natal have been told the road to their new airport will be finished this time next year. It’s just a shame there was only a mile in place ahead of the World Cup. The rest of it was cobbles and pot holes.

Best of the bets

Our top tipsters Brian Lee and Chris Cutmore go head to head with the best bets — here are their picks for Friday...

Best-bet Brian: It’s safe to watch TV after two nights of drivel. If ever a game could go all the way it’s France v Germany. Back the Germans to win on penalties.

Cut-price Chris: Germany have the flu but it is France who can catch them cold. They have been great in attack so go for both teams to score and France to win.
