Leicester City rounded off their unbeaten pre-season campaign with a narrow victory over Werder Bremen at the King Power Stadium.

Skipper Wes Morgan scored a seventh minute header to continue City's positive preparations for life in the Premier League; with the Foxes already beating Everton, Ilkeston, Walsall, MK Dons and Rotherham earlier in the summer.

But an injury to winger Marc Albrighton took the shine off the win for Leicester manager Nigel Pearson, who was forced to withdraw the 24-year-old in the second half.

Speaking after the match, Pearson said: 'It's about what you do when the season starts, but today we did well against a good technical team. Felt we were better side.' 

Leicester kick off their Premier League campaign at home to Everton.
