Walking along the dusty street in a small town on the fringes of Bangkok, smiling baby in her arms, passersby stop and stare.

Pattamaron Chanbua ignores them and flashes a kind smile back at her little boy fidgeting in the heat, as she makes her way to collect his siblings from school.

'See how everyone looks,' she says, 'they call him a farang [foreigner in Thai ] because they don't believe he's mine he's so white.

'When strangers ask I just say he's albino because it's too painful to have to bring up what happened each time.'

The pallid boy she holds tenderly is  Gammy, the one-year-old Down syndrome boy who became an overnight sensation in the gossipy town of the Chon Buri province where he lives, and indeed internationally, after he was unceremoniously abandoned in Thailand by his Australian parents.

The case sparked international outrage when it was reported that Wendy and David Farnell returned from Thailand with his healthy twin sister but left Gammy behind.

Mr Farnell claimed they had been told Gammy would be born with the genetic disorder before the twins were born, and asked the surrogacy agency to abort the child and give them a refund or find a solution.

Pattamaron, or Goy as she is more commonly known, insists that was never the case and that they dumped the boy and left.

Gammy was the centre of an international scandal when his Australian parents reportedly abandoned him in Thailand because he had Down syndrome but took his healthy twin sister back to Australia

Ganmy's father David Farnell said he had been told Gammy would be born with the genetic disorder before the twins were born, and asked the surrogacy agency to abort the child and give them a refund or find a solution

But Goy insists that was never the case and that they dumped the boy and left

What exactly happened remains unclear to this day but what is not in dispute is the love and affection the Chanbua family show for the 13-month old boy.

Today he leads a seemingly content life and is incessantly fussed over by his 21-year-old surrogate mother, grandmother Pichaya, 52, grandfather Prasong, 46, and his older brother and sister.

The school gates fling open and Goy's son Seagame, six, and four-year-old daughter Gamsai, race out, smiles as big as the crescent moon etched across their faces, making a beeline for Gammy.

Seagame begs his mother to let him carry Gammy who immediately recognises his face and lights up.

'You know, Gammy is a blessing, good karma,' says Goy, 'I often win the lottery a few times a month, only a few bhat each time, maybe 300 here ($11) or 400 ($15) there, but the biggest prize I ever won was Gammy,' she says.

'We all love him so much, sometimes I joke with the kids and say we have to give him back to the Australians and they cry.

'He's opened so many doors for us, we're now no longer living in poverty.'

Indeed Goy, a former food stall worker, and her brood, lived in cramped conditions in a one-bedroom home but since October they now share a more comfortable three bedroom, two-storey house paid for with a chunk of the $250,000 raised for the family through public donations.

Inside the floors are polished beige stone, there is new furniture including bunk beds and a comfy sofa, a modern bathroom  and television set.

A plethora of pictures of gurgling Gammy adorn the staircase, as well as a framed one of his twin sister, Pipah.

Toys are scarce and the few strewn across the sitting room, a squeaky pink pig and wide-eyed doll with no hair, terrify him.

'He doesn't like toys or cartoons, he's just not interested,' says Goy.

His grandmother Pichaya chips in: 'He's so smart, he loves the 6pm news and as soon as he hears it come on, he runs inside in his baby walker,' she says proudly.

Getting caught in the excitement, his doting grandfather chimes in: 'He loves the national anthem and stands still and tall in his walker when it comes on.

'He's adorable, he's such a happy baby, we all love him. He's brought us so much joy.' 

While Gammy remains blissfully unaware of the drama that has followed him thus far, his Thai family are under no illusions that he faces a tough future because of the health problems associated with his Down syndrome

While Gammy remains blissfully unaware of the drama that has followed him thus far, his Thai family are under no illusions that he faces a tough future.

The little boy, diagnosed with Down sydrome at six months, has been besieged with health problems.

He has been struck by repeated lung infections, cannot walk or crawl properly, suffers from dusty allergies and weak nails that break and fall off and was born with two webbed toes on each foot.

As well as health setbacks, last year he found himself unwittingly embroiled in yet another drama when it was revealed his Australian father has a string of previous convictions for sexual offences against girls as young as five.

Court documents released by the Supreme Court of Western Australia reveal that Farnell assaulted two girls aged seven to ten in 1982 and 1983 at his home and during 'secretive meetings' in his garden shed.

He also committed further offences against a five-year-old girl from 1988 to 1992. The identities of the three girls were not released but it is believed he knew them.

Commenting on the suitably of the Farnell to raise Gammy's twin, Goy says she believes the Australian authorities will ensure she is not exposed to any undue risk.

'Australia is not like Thailand where things are overlooked,' she told Daily Mail Australia, adding: 'They'll make sure Pipah is OK. I hope they love her as much as we love her brother.'

Reflecting on the events of last year, Goy, whose husband runs a grocery store, says she has no regrets but maintains she would never become a surrogate again

'One day I'll tell Gammy what happened, I'll tell him "When you were born you were so special because you had a sister and your parents couldn't afford two so we said we'd help,"' Goy said

Reflecting on the events of last year, Goy, whose husband runs a grocery store, says she has no regrets but maintains she would never become a surrogate again.

'I did for good money, it pays well, but happened to us was a shock – never again.

'In the end we're the ones who got lucky because Gammy is a blessing and changed our lives for the better.

'One day I'll tell Gammy what happened, I'll tell him "When you were born you were so special because you had a sister and your parents couldn't afford two so we said we'd help,"' she said.

'He may not be the same colour as us but we love him just the same.'
