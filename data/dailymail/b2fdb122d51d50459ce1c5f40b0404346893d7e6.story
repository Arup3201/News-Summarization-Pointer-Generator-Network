When Paul and Wendy Collins were woken by the sound of workmen digging holes outside their home, it was little more than an everyday suburban irritation.

This soon turned to alarm, however, when concrete posts were put into the holes and a six-foot timber fence erected across the front and side of the house they have lived in for 26 years.

‘It feels like we are behind some kind of Berlin Wall, like being a prisoner in our own home,’ said Mrs Collins.

Wendy Collins, from Brownhills, West Midlands, has been left unable to use her garden gate after her neighbour built a fence across it 

The move comes after a row with the property developer over the state of Mrs Collins's garden wall  

Mrs Collins and her husband looked on in horror as builders erected the wooden fence around their Victorian four-bedroom property last week

The fence was the culmination of a dispute the family have been having with the property company that owns the apartments next door, which says they had encroached on its land.

It means the Collinses can no longer use the front gate of their four-bedroom house, which can only be reached  from the rear, while the fence is all they can see out of their living-room window.

Mrs Collins, 62, a retired teacher, said: ‘The first we knew that a fence was going up was when the builders arrived on Friday. They refused to stop, so I called the police and the council, who sent an enforcement officer.

‘But he said planning permission wasn’t needed and dismissed it as a neighbour dispute. Now we have been barricaded in.’

The couple's Fiat Stilo worth £2,000, has also been blocked in by the fence, which has been erected around their property

The fence has been built on land owned Sadlers Mill Ltd which own 12 apartments overlooking the Collins' home

The fence was put 8in from her front gate on the perimeter of a car park owned by Sadlers Mill, a property firm formed by the 12 owners of apartments in a converted flour mill adjacent to the Collinses’ home in Brownhills, West Midlands.

Mr Collins, 60, an engineer, his wife and three children moved there in 1988, a few years after the conversion was completed. The property has a rear driveway, but the family began paying Sadlers Mill a nominal rent in 2012 to park two cars in its parking area in front of their home.

Mrs Collins, pictured standing outside her home, said: 'This is a Victorian house, it was built in 1865, it's never going to be a show home'

Mrs Collins said they can still get in and out via the back door but are unable to leave and enter their home through the front 

The developer who owns flats next door to the property said the wall was devaluing the price of his properties

Mr Nicholls said he put up the fence to keep it out of sight from potential buyers

Mrs Collins said the two sides fell out after a car crashed through her garden’s brick wall, partially demolishing it. She used the access it created to park her Fiat Stilo on the front lawn, where it is now stuck.

Sadlers Mill asked the family to tidy up the front of their home and even offered to pay for replacing the wall if the couple agreed to sign over ownership of it. Mrs Collins said the company warned it would build a new boundary fence if she did not rectify the damage, but heard no more about it until last Friday.

Mrs Collins says she now has to use a ladder to exit her home on the side of the new fence

The move, which followed a row over their crumbling garden fence, means they can no longer walk out of the front gate or move their car off the drive

Michael Nicholls, 57, a Sadlers Mill resident and director of the property management company, claimed the couple demolished part of the wall themselves to create access to an extra parking space for a third car, and said the state of the Collinses’ garden was hitting the value of the apartments.

He added: ‘It was unsightly and also trespassing on our land.

‘We have tried to be amicable and neighbourly, but Mr and Mrs Collins would accept no compromise. It’s a shame.’

Walsall council said: ‘The fence was erected under permitted development rights . . . The local planning authority cannot intervene.’

The developer insists he has been reasonable with the couple, who he says have 'accepted no compromise'

Mrs Collins said: 'We're like prisoners in our own home, we've been barricaded in. It feels like we are behind some kind of Berlin Wall'

The couple are also unable to receive their post due to their house being surrounded by the fence
