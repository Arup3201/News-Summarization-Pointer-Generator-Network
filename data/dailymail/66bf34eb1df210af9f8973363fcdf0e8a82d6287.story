A British man who allegedly threw a prostitute out of his 10metre high apartment window after a row about sex has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder.

The man, named only as Joseph Stephen H, 41, is alleged to have launched the Nigerian woman from his second floor flat window in Barcelona, Spain, at 6am on Wednesday morning.

Miraculously, the 27-year-old sex worker did not hit the ground as her clothes caught onto a metal bar that was dangling over a glass roof.

Police say that it was in that position that she was rescued by firefighters.

Spanish news website Terra reports that agents found the alleged attacker on a terrace of the building, where they arrested him on suspicion of attempted murder.
