Blood oozes from deep gashes that criss-cross his head and nose. His eyes look vacant and tired.

This shocking image reveals the extent of the horrific injuries suffered by springer spaniel Stig after owner Kim Edmonds' sickening attack.

Edmonds, was yesterday jailed for 20 weeks as the judged described the on her own pet as 'one of the worst cases of animal cruelty' he had witnessed.

The 21-year-old had initially blamed an ‘intruder’ for the savage attack in which her pet's head, nose and body were sliced 31 times.

However, Edmonds from Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire, was found guilty of causing unnecessary suffering to the dog at Stoke-on-Trent magistrates court last week.

Shocking: This image shows the horrific injuries suffered by springer spaniel Stig during a brutal attack by owner Kim Edmonds

Dog slasher: Kim Edmonds (pictured) was found guilty of slashing her two Springer 
Spaniels. Stig was found with 31 lacerations and burns while Dan 
(pictured) had lesser injuries in the horrific attack

She has also been given a lifetime disqualification of all animals and cannot apply for the ban to be lifted.

The court had heard that Edmonds, who had
 been taking medication for depression, had slashed her 14-year-old dog Stig 
and her other dog Dan to a lesser extent, in her back garden in 
September last year.

Stig had 31 separate lacerations and 
burn wounds on his head, nose and body, and has since been treated and rehomed after the horrific 
attack. It is not known what weapon was used to attack the dog.

The court heard that the nature of Stig’s injuries suggested he had been held down during the prolonged attack.

The RSPCA said Edmonds had claimed 
that an balaclava-wearing intruder had broken into her back garden and 
attacked the dog and her.

Shocking scene: Police said Edmonds' house looked like 'an abattoir' 
with blood everywhere. Her two dogs (pictured) were badly injured while 
she presented self-inflicted cuts, claiming an intruder had attacked her

She made a 999 call to Staffordshire 
police on September 7 last year - but her minor wounds were found to be 
self-inflicted and the police referred the case to the RSPCA.

According to This is Staffordshire,
 detective constable Gary Madeley from Burslem Police Station said: ‘It 
was like an abattoir. There was blood all over the living room and the 
kitchen.

‘Edmonds' demeanour, considering the report and her dog had been mutilated, was calm.’

Veterinary surgeon Carole Bain, who also attended the scene said: ‘I was shocked by what I saw.

‘I
 told her (Edmonds) Stig would need a lengthy operation and she asked if
 he would need a skin graft and demonstrated by pinching the skin on his
 head.

‘It was unusual as I have never known an owner show such calmness.’

Shocking mutilation: The RSPCA deputy chief inspector Jayne Bashford said the injuries sustained by the dogs were 'totally horrendous'. Stig needed a four hour operation and a week's recovery in a vet clinic (pictured)

Judge Taylor said: 'It’s a serious offence that needs the right course of action.'

Edmonds was convicted of one charge of the Section 4 Animal Welfare Act 2006.

The medical costs of the dogs has cost the RSPCA thousands of pounds. Both dogs have now been re-homed together.

RSPCA Deputy chief inspector Jayne 
Bashford said: 'Kim is a very dangerous lady and the injuries suffered 
by the dogs were totally horrendous.

Held down dogs: The court heard that the attack done by Edmonds (pictured with husband Brian and injured dog Dan) would have been lengthy and it was suggested that the dogs were held down during the attack

'In terms of injuries deliberately inflicted - this is the most traumatic incident I’ve seen.

'Every person involved has been severely affected by what they saw.

'It’s caused people a lot of distress.

'The dog -Stig - was at the vets for a week and had a four hour operation. It will cost the RSPCA thousands of pounds.'
