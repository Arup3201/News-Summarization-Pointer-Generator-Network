Taking longer to become pregnant led to a 30 per cent increased risk of having a child with mild neurological problems

Women who take a long time to get pregnant are at one-third higher risk of their child having ‘mild’ neurological problems, say researchers.

The finding may also help explain why children born after fertility treatment are more likely to have developmental difficulties.

It is well known that children conceived as a result of fertility treatment are at a higher risk of premature birth and low birth weight.

But evidence is now emerging that poor fertility plays a critical role, rather than IVF, say Dutch researchers.

They assessed the neurological development of 209 children at the age of two - all of whom were born to parents who had struggled to conceive, and most of whom had had fertility treatment.

Impaired fertility is defined as failing to become pregnant after 12 months.

The researchers found mild neurological problems affected 17 of the children - just under eight per cent - and were significantly more common among those whose parents had taken longer to conceive.

Taking longer to become pregnant led to a 30 per cent increased risk of giving birth to a child with mild neurodevelopmental problems.

The researchers assessed movement, posture and muscle tone, reflexes, and eye-hand coordination in the children, and took into account the parents’ ages.

The time taken to get pregnant among their parents averaged just over four years, but ranged from 1.6 to just over 13 years.

Evidence is now emerging that poor fertility plays a critical role in development

Parents whose children did not have these problems took an average of two years and 8 months to conceive, but ranging from one month to 13 years.

The study was published online in the Fetal & Neonatal Edition of Archives of Disease in Childhood.

Lead author Professor Mijna Hadders-Algra, Departmenf of Paediatrics, Division of Developmental Neurology, University of Groningen, said: ‘In conclusion, the present data suggest that increased time to pregnancy is associated with suboptimal neurological development.

‘This implies that factors associated with subfertility may play a role in the genesis of neurodevelopmental problems.’ Further research will be needed before couples can be given advice based on this finding, she said.
