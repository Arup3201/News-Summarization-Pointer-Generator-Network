Rob Edwards has been sacked as manager of Tranmere.

Rovers were relegated last season and had hoped to make an immediate return to Sky Bet League One but have made a poor start to life in the bottom division under Edwards, who replaced John McMahon at the end of May.

Saturday's home defeat to Plymouth was Tranmere's seventh league loss of the campaign and their fourth on the spin in a seven-game winless run that has left the Wirral club bottom of the Football League.

Rob Edwards has been sacked by Tranmere Rovers after less than five months in charge of the club

Rovers chairman Mark Palios told the club's official website, tranmererovers.co.uk: 'Rob is a decent man who has worked very hard over the past few months for the football club.

'However, with the club currently sitting at the bottom of League 2 for the first time in 32 years it was decided this was the right time to make the break.

'I remain committed to the vision, that Rob shared, of playing free-flowing and skilful football.

'And while we have shown in some of our periods of play that we are not far off being able to achieve that - we have not been able to do it consistently.

'We have also not been sufficiently pragmatic when circumstances demanded that we close out a game to secure a win.

'If we are to achieve the required results in future it is clear that we need to strengthen the squad further.'

Palios went on to highlight the need for the next manager to have good contacts to help with the recruitment of new players.

He added: 'Our recruitment department, which has been depleted by years of under-investment, is being supplemented and strengthened.

'But in the short term our ability to find new players to cover injuries and to supplement the existing line up will also depend on having in place a manager with an extensive network of contacts in the game.

'This will therefore be one of the key attributes that I will be looking for in a replacement for Rob.'

Tranmere have won just two matches this season. Both victories - away at Wycombe and at home to Morecambe - came in August.
