More than 1,000 women and men were marching for gender equality in New York City today - as millions of people across the world rallied to demand change on International Women's Day 2015.

Demonstrators gathered at the United Nations headquarters in Manhattan this morning to speak up for the gender that traditionally is paid less for work and often has a smaller voice in policy decisions.

They then marched to Times Square as women and men in France, Turkey, Peru, India, Morocco, Brazil, China, and elsewhere also took to the streets of their respective nations to fight for equality.

Trying to make a difference: Phumzile Mlambo, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon (second right) and New York City first lady, Chirlane McCray (far right) were among those marking International Women's Day today

Addressing the New York marchers,  the city's first lady, Chirlane McCray, 60, a self-proclaimed feminist, declared: 'Today, you are marching in the footsteps of generations of feminists.'

She noted that International Women's Day commemorates the day in 1908 when thousands of women marched through the city demanding shorter hours, better pay and voting rights.

'This march started more than a century ago, but we still have a long way to go before we get to equality,' added Ms McCray, who is married to New York Mayor Bill de Blasio. 

UN officials today said much has been achieved under the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, signed by 189 governments in 1995 as a pledge for realizing women's rights.

However, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said the gains have been too slow and uneven. He said the most urgent issue is rape being used as a war weapon, from Nigeria  to Iraq and Syria.

McCray pointed to universal prekindergarten, paid sick leave and other causes that her husband has emphasized as a mark of progress for women in New York City.

In November, New York joined the UN's Safe Global Cities Initiative, which works to combat sexual harassment and sexual violence in public places.

To commemorate the day, Google displayed a new Doodle, featuring women in a range of professions, including an astronaut, a judge, a scientist and a painter.

The first National Woman's Day (NWD) was observed across the US on February 28, 1909.
