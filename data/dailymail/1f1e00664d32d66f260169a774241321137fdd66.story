Around Saturn lurks a bizarre moon named Iapetus.

It’s odd, not just because one side of the planet is light and the other dark, but also because it has a giant ridge running across it.

Until now astronomers weren’t sure how this ridge came to be on the moon, but a new study suggests it may have fallen there – from the sky.

Did this ridge fall from space? New research suggests a the huge mountainous range (pictured by Cassini) on the Saturnian moon Iapetus may have dropped from the sky

The team of researchers that made the discovery are from Brown University in Rhode Island and the Lunar Planetary Institute in Texas.

In their paper they suggest that the mountainous ridge, which runs around the equator of the moon, most likely was not created on the surface.

Instead they say it is of exogenic origin, meaning it came from an external source, which may have been a ring system around the moon.

Ring systems around moons are almost non-existent, which would make this discovery very interesting.

Discovery: 25 October 1671

Distance from Saturn: 2.2 million miles (3.5 million kilometres)

Time taken to orbit Saturn: 79.3 Earth days

Radius: 450 miles (735 kilometres)

Speed needed to leave the surface: 1,280 miles (2,000 kilometres) per hour

It has been thought that moons are unable to have their own ring system as the gravity of their host planet is too invasive.

Only one moon is known of that may have a ring system: Rhea, another of Saturn’s moons, which orbits far enough away to have such a system.

But if it is discovered that Iapetus, too, once had a ring system it could change our understanding of how moons can thrive in their orbits.

The latest theory was based on 3D models of the moon, from which the researchers analysed the types of peaks on the ridge.

Iapetus is one of Saturn's 62 moons (53 confirmed, nine potential moons) and orbits quite far out when compared to the others. Titan dominates the moons though and is much larger than all the rest combined

Iapetus is unusual because one side is much brighter than the other. The darker surface can be seen starting on the right. The bright hemisphere is the trailing hemisphere in the moon's orbit

The ridge is 12 miles (19 km) high by 12 miles wide and stretches 800 miles (1,300 km) around Iapetus.

The 3D model was created using data from the Cassini space probe, which has been operating in the Saturnian system since it arrived in July 2004.

The team found most of the peaks sat at their angle of repose, which is the maximum angle that material can rest on a peak without falling to the bottom.

Normal geological activity forms shallow peaks with less uniformity, which suggests the mountains were not created via such means but rather were part of a ring of material that once circled the moon.

This ring could have been created by a collision of another body with the moon, or by two bodies colliding nearby.

The resultant material from the impact would have coalesced around the equator of the moon.

Over time this ring could have been dragged to the surface by the moon’s gravity.

Supporting this theory, according to the team, is the irregular orbit of Iapetus and the fact it is tidally locked, which means the same face always points towards Saturn.

Further research will be needed, though, to truly determine if the intriguing theory is correct.

The Cassini spacecraft has been in orbit around Saturn since July 2004. During its mission it has observed many of the moons and also released a lander, Huygens, onto the surface of Titan on Christmas Day 2004

Instead it is believed the Saturnian moon once had a ring around it

Over time this ring fell to the surface of Iapetus and created the vast ridge

Iapetus is a strange two-toned world and is one of Saturn's 62 moons
