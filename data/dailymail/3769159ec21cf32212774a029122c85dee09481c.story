Jack Dorsey is widely known the founder of Twitter but a new book has revealed that it was his friend that he later pushed out of the company who helped take Dorsey's germ of an idea and turn it into a reality.

Dorsey wasn't even the one who came up with the name of the social media site, and it was his friend Noah Glass who should be credited with the moniker.

Glass reportedly spent days flipping through a dictionary looking for inspiration before making a mental connection between the vibration of a phone, to a twitch, to twitter.

The story of how Glass helped develop the new status-updating service and taking ownership of the idea before Dorsey allegedly made a power play and got their third partner- Evan Williams- to fire him is all detailed in a New York Times preview of an upcoming book, called Hatching Twitter.

Plotting: A new book tells how Jack Dorsey (seen here in September) pushed his friend and Twitter co-founder Noah Glass out of the company because he felt threatened

'I was not in the story, which in some ways was difficult to deal with in the beginning, since it was a massive labor of love and a massive labor to get it created,' Glass told Business Insider in an exclusive interview.

'To create the thing, to bring it into the world. It was a ton of effort and a ton of energy.

Man left behind: Noah Glass was part of the team that came up with Twitter but then ousted from the company

The 'he said, he said' account of who really came up with the idea adds Twitter to the growing list of boldfaced company names whose creation is plagued by ego trips and PR moves.

Dorsey was a 29-year-old college dropout who couldn't get a job as a shoe salesman when he sent Evan Williams his resume to see if he had a job for him.

Williams was four years older than Dorsey and made a name for himself in Silicon Valley by selling Blogger to Google for millions of dollars.

At the time, Williams and his neighbor and fellow college dropout Noah Glass were running a new company called Odeo that was focusing on producing podcasts.

Author Nick Bilton tells how Odeo was 
floundering because their service was made slightly irrelevant once 
iTunes began streaming podcasts, so they began turning to their 
engineers and other employees for new possible ventures.

Dorsey
and Williams, who were good friends both in and out of the office, 
reportedly started talking seriously about the idea for a 
status-updating site after a night of heavy drinking.

'There
was a moment when I was sitting with Jack and I said, "Oh, I do see how
this could really come together to make something really compelling." 
We were sitting on Mission St. in the car in the rain. We were going out
and I was dropping him off and having this conversation. There was a 
moment where it all fit together for me,' Glass said.

The
late night conversation in 2006 turned into a reality and Williams got 
on board, involving the board of Odeo and pursuing a number of venture 
capital funders.

Big name: Dorsey originally approached Evan Williams (pictured) about getting a job at the old company he used to run with Glass called Odeo. Williams was famous in the tech world at that point for selling Blogger to Google for millions

Public face: Dorsey has made a concerted effort to portray himself as the sole founder of the company and accepts many interview opportunities as they are a chance to brand himself and the company

The lengthy book excerpt tells how there were growing pains throughout the multi-year formation leading right up to the recent announcement that they are looking for a billion dollar IPO launch.

One of the biggest problems that hindered their rapid growth was Dorsey's lack of management skills.

He allegedly regularly left the office by 6pm to make it in time for hot yoga lessons and a fashion design course that he was taking at a local school.

Williams eventually sat him down and gave him an ultimatum: 'You can either be a dressmaker or the C.E.O. of Twitter, but you canâ€™t be both.'

Much like Steve Jobs before him who was ousted from Apple before re-joining the company, Dorsey was asked to leave so that Williams, who was a stronger manager, could become CEO.

Dorsey didn't take the news well and spoke to Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg about coming to work for the competing social media giant.

Makeover: Dorsey used to have a nose ring but changed his look once being appointed CEO

In the end, there was no clear role for Dorsey, though Facebook was happy to bring him on board and iron out the details later. Dorsey ended up leaving that be and creating his mobile payment program, Square.

Dorsey later re-joined Twitter and is largely seen as the public face of the company- much to his own credit as he has given plenty of interviews telling about how he came up with the idea for the massive company.

'While Dorsey had the germ of the idea, without the collaboration of the people who worked at Odeo, that idea would have remained just an idea,' Bilton writes.

Dorsey never mentioned Glass in interviews and Glass' stock holdings means that he will likely only make the same amount as Dorsey's secretary made through Square. By comparison, Dorsey stands to make $2billion, and Williams could bring home $8billion.

'I haven't spoken with him in 5 years. He has his own ideas about how life works,' Glass told Business Insider.

Jack Dorsey is largely seen as the founder of Twitter but a new book tells about how he came up with the idea with a friend

@highlight

That friend, Noah Glass, was the one to come up with the name 'Twitter'

Dorsey had no management experience and his partner Evan Williams told him to stop leaving work to take fashion design classes

Now Glass will make a percentage of what Dorsey and Williams will make once Twitter's IPO is set and the company goes public
