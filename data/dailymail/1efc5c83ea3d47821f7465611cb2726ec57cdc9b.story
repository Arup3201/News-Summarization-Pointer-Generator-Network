They shared countless cups of tea, dinner parties and Christmases over decades spent living in the same street.

So when John and Clare Boots decided to move to a new estate two miles away from their house in Newport, Wales - breaking up the three families' close-knit circle - their neighbours followed right behind.

Now the Boots, their friends Steve and Mary Parker, and Jane Jones and her partner Mark Watkins say they feel like they've 'won the lottery' after they all moved into neighbouring houses on the new development.

There to lend a hand: When Mr and Mrs Boots decided to move to a new development less than two miles away in Newport, their neighbours followed right behind them

When the Boots moved into a house in the Bryn 20 years ago, they became fast friends with Steve and Mary, who have two sons, Gareth and Owain, and had been living in the property two doors down for 28 years.

The close-knit group expanded to include Jane Jones, who had been living in the Bryn for 22 years, and her partner Mark Watkins when he moved in 10 years ago.

'We all just gelled,' Mr Boots said. 'We were never in each others' pockets, just always there for each other.

'There
have been tears and laughter. My father recently passed away and Mark 
has had heart problems and we'd all been a support system.

'We
all loved that old-fashioned neighbourhood set-up. It was an open-door 
policy - we'd pop over for a glass of wine or have dinner at each 
other's houses. Christmases were especially fun,' Mr Boots said.

Where it all began: The three families had been living at The Bryn in Newport for a combined total of 70 years

Fresh start: The friendships they forged over the years look set to continue after they all moved to the new development at Westfield Rise

But after many happy years at the Bryn, Mr Boots handed his wife his credit card and told her to 'buy something nice'.

Mrs Boots set her heart on a new home at the nearby development in Westfield Rise, and the couple set about breaking the news to their friends.

'We were ready to move, it was the next step,' Mr Boot said.

'It's such a beautiful house, the price was right and the move was so smooth - we'd do it all again.'

Mark and Jane put an offer in on a house three doors down to the Boots' new property within a week, and within six months the Parkers snapped up the house next door.

Reunited: The three families are now neighbours once again, living in a row of houses on Westfield Rise

The three couples are now neighbours once again in the cul-de-sac, recreating the sense of community they enjoyed in their old road.

Mr Boots said: 'I've been back and forth mowing the lawn for them in preparation and we're planning a big house-warming. It's made us even closer - we all finish each other's sentences.

'The Parkers and us look after each others' gardens and if I'm outside cutting the grass it can take me hours because we're all chatting.'

Despite living in such close quarters for so many years, Mr Boots insists their has never been a quarrel between the families.

'We've never fallen out, and I honestly don't think we ever will,' he said.

'We're friends for life. When the others told us they wanted to live here too, it was like we'd won the lottery.'

Denise Swift, sales manager for Bellway Homes, said: 'It's fantastic that the three sets of families have all decided to relocate together at Westfield Rise. It's been lovely seeing them all moving in and helping each other out.

'They're a perfect example of good neighbours and we hope they go on to live at Westfield Rise for another 20 years.'
