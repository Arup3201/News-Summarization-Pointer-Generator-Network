A 19-year-old man who refers to himself as 'King Pekas' has been arrested after allegedly raping a 13-year-old girl he met on Facebook, police said on Tuesday.

Abraham Bucio-Bucio, from Tulsa, Oklahoma, reportedly traveled to the unidentified girl's home, north of the city, and asked her to have sex with him after speaking to her on the social network.

When she declined, Bucio-Bucio grabbed her, before ripping off her pants and sexually assaulting her, it is alleged. The victim apparently suffered a number of minor injuries.

Police were alerted to the alleged incident at around 9.10pm on Sunday by staff at Hillcrest Medical Center. Officers traveled to the hospital, where they found the girl in a 'catatonic state'.

While there, they spoke with her sister, who alleged that Bucio-Bucio had raped her relative earlier that evening after meeting her on Facebook on Saturday, according to Tulsa World. 

After sexually assaulting his young victim, the teenager had then apologized to the girl through the photo messaging service, Snapchat, the sister claimed.

Now, Bucio-Bucio - who is believed to be engaged - has been arrested on suspicion of first-degree rape and lewd molestation. His bond has been set at $100,000.

During an interview with police, the suspect reportedly told officers that the girl had told him she was 18 years old. However, he later admitted that he knew she was just 13, it is alleged.

He was also found to have deleted several text messages from the girl, who cannot be identified for legal reasons. The victim is reportedly recovering from her ordeal and unspecified injuries.

According to court records, Bucio-Bucio was accused of two counts of sexual battery in Tulsa County last October. But these were dismissed when a prosecution witness in the case failed to appear.

On his Facebook page, the suspect goes by the name 'King Pekas Bucio'. He is also listed as being engaged - and has posted numerous photos of himself and his 'fiancée', who uses his surname.
