Arrested: Al-Muqqadin Means faces murder charges in the death of 17-year-old Aquilla Flood

The ex boyfriend of a New Jersey prom queen has been arrested and faces murder charges relating to the 17-year-old's death.

Aquilla Flood, from East Orange, NJ, was shot dead in the bedroom of her home last Wednesday morning, just days before her 18th birthday.

Her 18-year-old ex, Al Muqqadin Means, was captured by a federal task force inside a Newark apartment, NJ.com reported.

Prosecutors have not revealed a possible motive, but Aquilla's mother said Means had sent threats to her daughter after she refused his prom invite.

Means surrendered to the FBI task 
force after being cornered inside the apartment building at around 
12:30pm yesterday, and was not armed.

No other details about the arrest have been released yet because the investigation is still ongoing.

Aquilla's
aunt told NJ.com: 'We are extremely excited and happy for that (his 
arrest), but it sill doesn't bring out beloved niece and daughter back.'

Her body will be buried on Wednesday morning.

Flood,
who would have graduated from high school this weekend and was recently
voted prom queen at Campus high School, was found by a relative in a 
pool of blood in her own bed with a single gunshot wound to her head 
just before 7.30am last Wednesday. There was no sign of forced entry.

The
17-year-old spent Tuesday evening shopping for shoes for her upcoming 
prom with her mother and grandmother before going to bed as normal.

Her mother was asleep in the next room and her uncle said he looked in on her around 3am and she was fine.

Aquilla
broke up with Means several months ago after his sister warned the 
student that her brother was violent, Flood's mother said.

Threats
from Means allegedly started just weeks after the breakup and Aquilla 
had told her uncle of her fears - even asking to move apartments so he 
couldn't find her.

Friends and fellow students at Campus High School were shocked by the popular student's death.

At a vigil for the teen last week, her friend Jadaisha Richardson told NBC: 'She was the best person you could ever meet.'

Her aunt Naimah Hicks said: 'She was a sweet girl. She will truly be missed. My heart is totally broken.' 

She had aspirations of attending  the Fashion Institute of Technology.

A 19-year-old Newark resident, Tasjoin Williams, was also arrested along with Means, but he was charged with an unrelated armed robbery. Police have not revealed whether or not the men had a relationship.
