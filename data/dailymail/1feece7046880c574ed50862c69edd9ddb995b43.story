The young girl was shot as Walker allegedly fired several times at random targets, according to Fox.

Police said on Monday that Walker was the sole person involved and did not know the teenage girl or have connections to other targets he shot at.

Neighbors reported that weapons were removed from Walker's home on Friday where he had lived for about four months. He is not believed to belong to any gangs.

Miss Conley, an A-grade student and lacrosse star, was shot dead in a random drive-by shooting as she walked with friends to a sleepover to celebrate her 15th birthday.

She was walking along a narrow road in a residential area of Lake Stevens, Washington on June 1 when gunfire broke out and she was fatally hit in the neck.

Police received several calls at 11.18pm and officers rushed to the scene, where they found Molly unresponsive. None of her friends were injured.

Random violence: Walker is being held without bail after he allegedly shot dead a teenage girl at random last month

Walker, who works for Boeing and is originally from Everett, Washington, appeared in court on Monday where his lawyer requested more time to read the legal documents. The 26-year-old is being held without bail. 

Molly, who had just turned 15 when she was killed, had 
planned to spend the night at a friend's house before her birthday 
party. Instead, her friends attended a vigil for Molly at a local 
church.

Michel Hazen, who lives around the corner from the street, told KIRO: 'Just as I was kind of drifting off to sleep, I heard a loud, maybe a yell or a scream or something.... Then I started hearing sirens.'

Molly was a freshman student at Blanchet High School in Seattle, where she had achieved the nickname '4.0' for her perfect grades.

Friends and relatives remembered her as 
an accomplished student and actress and a talented lacrosse player who 
brightened up their days with her positive, caring attitude.

Conley even persuaded her mother and stepfather to be foster parents to babies waiting for permanent homes.

'Molly would help take care of them, and she was extremely passionate,' her mother Susan Arksey told the Seattle Times.

The president of the school, Tony 
Desapio, said he was devastated by the killing and is offering support and counseling to
 students.

'It was a deep moment of sharing grief, 
and longing and missing Molly and a deep moment of trying to make sense 
of a real tragedy,' Desapio said.

'Molly was a vibrant, wonderful 
presences in our community. She was a blessing to us.'

Friends also expressed their sadness 
and condolences on Facebook. One of her closest friends, Iris Thatcher, 
uploaded pictures of the girls as she paid tribute.

'Thank
 you Molly for some of the best years I had ever had,' she wrote. 'I 
love you so much and this is so hard to go through knowing one of my 
best friends is gone.

'Thanks for being the best and impacting my life so greatly. RIP.'

Conley leaves behind a sister, who is a senior at the school, and a brother, who is in 10th grade.

Lake Stevens, the area where the shooting took place, has suffered several other shootings in recent weeks. There are bullet holes in signs near to where Molly was killed.

It is a suburban community with around 28,000 residents and largely made up with families. It surrounds a large lake around which many businesses and recreational activities center.
