Real Madrid fans tried to kick Gareth Bale’s car and shouted abuse at Toni Kroos and Raphael Varane as the players left training on Monday.

The atmosphere around the club is far from positive, given their back-to-back defeats against Real Sociedad and rivals Atletico Madrid.

When the players left their Valdebebas training complex in their expensive sports cars, a group of fans were waiting for them.

Some shouted for Bale to sign autographs, but he didn’t stop and two of them tried to kick his car on the way past.

One clearly missed, while the second appears to make some minor contact.

German midfielder Kroos, a summer signing from Bayern Munich, had some fans shout: “W*****! Foreign s***” at him, while France international Varane was also abused.

The incident was captured by Spanish television station Cuatro.

Madrid are preparing for their first Champions League match, against Basle at the Santiago Bernabeu on Tuesday.

The game against Atletico on Saturday was marked by fan dissent from the stands, with goalkeeper Iker Casillas and striker Karim Benzema in particular being whistled at.

Supporters are also unhappy that Angel di Maria and Xabi Alonso were sold this summer without adequate replacements coming in.

Manager Carlo Ancelotti defended his side’s performances, saying: ‘We have to get used to new players and try to play with more spontaneity.

‘We have players who didn’t arrive until the end of August and we haven’t had much time to train with them. They need time.’
