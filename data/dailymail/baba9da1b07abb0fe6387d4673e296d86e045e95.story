Iceland has received an informal approach from an intermediary who says NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden wants to seek asylum there, it has emerged.

Snowden fled his home in Hawaii, where he worked for NSA contractor Booz Allen Hamilton, after exposing the U.S. government's top surveillance secrets. He is at a secret location in Hong Kong.

In a column in Icelandic daily newspaper Frettabladid, WikiLeaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson wrote that a middleman had approached him on behalf of Snowden.

'On 12 June, I received a message from Edward Snowden where he asked me to notify the Icelandic government that he wanted to seek asylum in Iceland,' Hrafnsson, who is also an investigative journalist in Iceland, told Reuters.

He added that he has yet to receive a response from officials about his request but said they have a 'moral obligation' to answer the call for help.

The Icelandic government, which has refused to say whether they would grant asylum to Snowden, confirmed it had received the message from Hrafnsson.

'Kristinn Hrafnsson has contacted two ministries in an informal way but not the ministers,' a government spokesman said. 'There has been no formal approach in this matter.'

Safety: Iceland has a reputation for promoting internet freedoms. Reykjavik is pictured

Iceland has a reputation for 
promoting Internet freedoms and has long been discussed as an option for Snowden.

As a U.S. citizen, Snowden would not need a visa to enter Iceland and could immediately apply for asylum. He would be free to live in Iceland while immigration authorities decide his case, which could take more than a year, experts have said.

But if Snowden wants to seek refuge in Iceland, he'll have to get there first. And this is where the U.S. could have a chance.

Interpol will sometimes issue a 'red notice' - which is like an international arrest warrant - but keep it sealed so that the person doesn't know it exists. If he tried to travel, he would be arrested at the airport.

If he did get to Iceland, it is unknown if he would be safe. The government of newly-elected Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson is believed to be closer to Washington than past administrations and less keen to foster the country's cyber-haven image.

'I would be very surprised if they (the government) would be eager to engage in any international disputes with the U.S. And it is pretty difficult to be granted asylum here,' Stefania Oskarsdottir, lecturer in political science at the University of Iceland, told Reuters. 'I think what this guy is saying is based on something he is imagining or hoping for rather than actual facts.'

Iceland does have an extradition treaty with 
the United States, but it is unclear if it would cover any crimes 
that he might be charged with.

Hrafnsson would not identify who the middleman was.

Snowden has previously mentioned Iceland as a possible refuge.

Iceland has a reputation for 
promoting Internet freedoms, but Snowden has said did not travel there 
immediately from the United States as he feared the country could be 
pressured by Washington.

'Iceland
 could be pushed harder, quicker, before the public could have a chance 
to make their feelings known, and I would not put that past the current 
U.S. administration,' Snowden said in an online forum in the Guardian on
 Monday.

It had been 
suggested that he would actually flee to the Icelandic consulate in Hong 
Kong, rather than risking boarding a plane to fly there in person.

Icelandic officials told USA Today last week that Snowden is missing a key element.

'The main stipulation for seeking 
asylum in Iceland would be that the person must be in Iceland to start 
the process,' said Johannes Tomasson, the chief spokesman for Iceland's 
Ministry of Interior in Reykjavik.

'That would be the ground rule No. 
1.'

WikiLeaks founder 
Julian Assange, who is holed up in the Ecuadorian embassy in London to 
avoid extradition to Sweden for questioning over allegations of sex 
crimes, visited Iceland several times in the run-up to some of the 
website's major releases.

Assange denies any wrongdoing.

Yet some experts added that Iceland might not be as welcoming as Snowden hopes.

The government of newly-elected Prime
 Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson has not been tested in relation to these cases, but is believed to be closer to 
Washington than past administrations and less keen to foster the 
country's cyber-haven image.

'I would be very surprised if they 
(the government) would be eager to engage in any international disputes 
with the U.S. And it is pretty difficult to be granted asylum here,' 
Stefania Oskarsdottir, lecturer in political science at the University 
of Iceland, told Reuters.

'I think what this guy is saying is based on 
something he is imagining or hoping for rather than actual facts.'

Yahoo has joined a list of major technology companies in releasing how many times the government requests data on its users - and it was a hefty 13,000 times in the past six months.

The company, based in Sunnyvale, California, followed the likes of Facebook, Microsoft, Apple and Google in releasing the broad numbers pertaining to the period from December 1, 2012 and May 31, 2013 in the wake of the NSA surveillance program revelations.

Yahoo said most often, the government requested data concerning fraud, homicide, kidnapping and other criminal investigations.

However, the number, which hovers somewhere between 12,000 and 13,000 also includes requests made under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.

Unlike some of its competitors, Yahoo did not reveal how many accounts the government requested information on so it's hard to say how many customers have been impacted.

In a blog post on Tuesday night, CEO Marissa Mayer said: 'Like all companies, Yahoo! cannot lawfully break out FISA request numbers at this time because those numbers are classified; however, we strongly urge the federal government to reconsider its stance on this issue.'

Mayer, writing with the company's general counsel Ron Bell, said the internet firm would from now on release reports twice a year on global law enforcement requests.
