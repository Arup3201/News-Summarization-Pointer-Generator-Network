The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are set to copy millions of other British families by building a conservatory on their new 10-bedroom country bolthole in the grounds of Sandringham.

William, Kate and Prince George are likely to move into Anmer Hall in a matter of months and are spending large sums to make the Norfolk mansion more private, secure and comfortable.

Royal aides have now applied for planning consent to put a glass-roofed extension on the kitchen at the Georgian property, which has been given to the couple by the Queen.

New life: A conservatory is to be built on Anmer Hall, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's future home in the grounds of Sandringham

Second home: If as expected the Cambridges move in, the new conservatory could be built in the place of the current one, which overlooks the grand gardens

Their proposed conservatory is an adaptation of a planned 16ft by 16ft garden room which has already been approved by King's Lynn and West Norfolk Borough Council.

But the application is not being published 'for reasons of national security'.

The original plans for the garden room showed it having panoramic views from its windows on all three sides with a tiled roof.

But a new planning application for the Georgian mansion on the Sandringham estate asks for a glazed roof on the extension instead of tiles, allowing even more sunlight to flood in.

An architect's drawing submitted with the application, shows a 10ft by 6ft table as the room's centre piece where William and Kate and baby Prince George will eat and entertain guests.

The Queen has asked the current tenant to vacate the property as soon as possible, four years before his lease is up, and he may be gone by the end of the year.

The conservatory will overlook a patio with a new pergola made from stone columns with oak beams for plants to trail through and provide shade.

The Grade Two listed hall already has a conservatory, but it is unclear if it will be kept or knocked down to make way for the new one.

The new plans have been drawn up by architect Charles Morris, who was behind a controversial extension for Prince Charles at his own country home Highgrove House.

The amended application, submitted by the Sandringham estate, includes plans to install a generator to ensure that security equipment still functions in the event of a power cut.

It also asks the council to do away with an earlier requirement for an archaeological dig to take place on the route of a proposed new driveway to the ten bedroom house.

The dig was originally proposed as the field which the driveway will cross was once the site of the village of Anmer which dates back to Anglo Saxon times.

Last week it was revealed that the path of the new driveway had been carved out by diggers and archaeologists had begun a preliminary investigation to see what was under the surface.

Royal aides state in the application that the foundations of the road will not be deep enough to disturb any ancient remains.

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's plans for a conservatory on their new home is based on a trend started more than two centuries ago.

Britain's love of them dates back to the early 19th century, when they were a signature of the grandest properties.

The glass structures allowed people to enjoy their gardens all year round, and they were often doubled as greenhouses to grow fruit and vegetables.

They became more mainstream thanks to the Crystal Palace, which housed the 1851 
Exhibition in London, and a glass extension soon became a must for the rich and famous.

There was a further boom in the 1920s but it was not until the 1970s that they became affordable for many and became the emblem of the upwardly mobile, now often called Worcester Woman and Mondeo Man.

Today homeowners can construct their own ones using DIY kits costing just £995, but the most expensive can cost more than £60,000.

They propose that archaeologists will monitor building work and that a full dig will only be carried out if any important relics are unearthed.

Council officials are due to decide in days whether the amendment will be allowed, possibly using delegated powers so the plans do not have to go before councillors.

The change will speed up work on the new driveway, although alterations to the hall are unlikely to be completed for some months.

The start of work has raised speculation that William, 31, and wife Kate are set to move in within a matter of months.

Work has also started on creating a new car park and path for St Mary's church next door to the hall as the existing church gate will become a private entrance for the Duke and Duchess.

Anmer Hall is set to become the couple's second luxury home following the prince's decision to leave the RAF last month after three years as a search and rescue helicopter pilot in Anglesey.

He and Kate are in the process of moving into their new London home - the 21-room Apartment 1A at Kensington Palace - which has been renovated at a cost to taxpayers of £1.1million.

But all the work to Anmer Hall will be paid for by the Royal family as it is privately owned by the Queen.

The hall which includes a tennis court and swimming pool is around two miles from Sandringham House.

It is surrounded by farmland on the Queen's 20,000 acre estate, meaning that Kate and William will have a high level of privacy to bring up baby George.

The Queen is believed to have asked the current tenant to leave even though he has four years left on his lease.

Businessman James Everett has rented the hall from the Queen for the last 13 years and has been running his bespoke timber company, Norfolk Oak, from its stables.

His company's blog confirmed in July that the hall would soon be 'faced with Royalty once more'.

Norfolk Oak has already moved its workshops and offices to new premises at the former RAF West Raynham base in Norfolk.

Mr Everett and his family are understood to be moving soon, but he has not responding to requests for comment.

King's Lynn and West Norfolk Borough Council gave planning permission in March for improvements to Anmer Hall including the garden room.

Consent was also given for a garage block and wood store to be converted into storage areas and accommodation which could be used by police guards or baby George's nanny

The re-routing of the driveway will mean that the front gate to the house will be moved so members of the public will be kept away.

It is understood that dozens of extra armed officers are being recruited to help provide security at Anmer Hall.

Norfolk Police confirmed in July that the force was looking for extra firearms officer to 'address a current shortfall in numbers'.

The hall was used as an illicit bolt-hole by Prince Charles and the then Camilla Parker-Bowles during their long-running affair when it was rented by the prince's late friend Hugh van Cutsem.

Prince William, who is close to the van Cutsems' four sons is also said to have enjoyed many happy visits to the hall as a child.

A Clarence House spokeswoman refused to discuss the plans for Anmer Hall, saying: 'It is a private matter. We won't be making any comment on it at all.'

The house was previously leased to the Duke and Duchess of Kent as their country house from 1972 until 1990.
