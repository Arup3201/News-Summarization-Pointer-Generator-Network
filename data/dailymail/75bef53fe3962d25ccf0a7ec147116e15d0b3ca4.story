She was a beautiful girl from a loving family who attended a leading private school.

Anna Johnson, 15, appeared to have a bright future ahead of her, but all that was lost when her body was found on a motorway half a mile from her home.

The teenager apparently fell from a bridge over the M9 near Stirling and police have found no evidence of foul play.

Mystery: It is thought Anna Johnson, 15, who was a student at Morrison's Academy in Perthshire, may have fallen from a bridge over the M9 motorway

Yesterday Morrison’s Academy, the 
£10,000-a-year school she attended, announced an internal investigation 
amid internet claims that the teenager took her own life after being a 
victim of bullying.

A Facebook website – Anna’s Angels – 
has been set up in her memory and dedicated to combating ‘teen 
depression’ and ‘helping suicidal teens’.

Friends dropped 15 white roses on to the carriageway in tribute and more than 20 bouquets of flowers were tied to railings above where Anna died, with one stating: ‘Heaven has another angel.’

Just what led this popular 
girl to fall to her death shortly before 7am on Tuesday is unclear.

She is understood to have left home less than an hour before her body was spotted by a motorist.

Police are still investigating how she came to be on the motorway, and have appealed for anyone who may have seen her on the way to the bridge.

Anna lived with father Paul Johnson, 
49, a former police constable, and mother Shona, 47, a doctor, as well 
as her younger brother.

Mr Johnson said: ‘The whole family are devastated. We can’t believe she is gone.’

But the father of two insisted her 
death was not connected to the academy 20 miles away in Crieff, 
Perthshire, where she was a fourth-year pupil. ‘Some have said this was 
something to do with the school but it has absolutely nothing to do with
this. Anna was really happy there.’

The school head, Rector Simon 
Pengelley, said: ‘All the staff and pupils are deeply saddened by the 
untimely death of Anna Johnson.

‘She was a well-respected and popular pupil and our thoughts are with her family and friends.

‘The school is committed to  
supporting the police during their investigation and we will be 
conducting our own internal investigations. Therefore it would be 
inappropriate of us to provide any further comment at this time.’

'Overwhelming sadness': Rector Simon Pengelley said news of the schoolgirl's death had come as a shock to all at Morrison's Academy

A string of online messages blamed 
‘bullies’ for Anna’s death, but it is not clear whether there is any 
foundation to the allegations. One wrote: ‘Awful to think someone so 
young would take their own life – no one should be pushed that far.’

Another message on Twitter said: ‘I 
hope you’re in a happier place now. My thoughts are with your family and
friends. Such a beautiful girl #RIPAnna.’

The 530-pupil school has the motto Ad 
Summa Tendendum – To Strive For The Highest. Its website boasts of 
producing ‘fine citizens’ who develop an ‘invaluable balance between 
confidence and humility’.

Former pupils include film star Ewan McGregor and Scottish rugby international Simon Taylor.
