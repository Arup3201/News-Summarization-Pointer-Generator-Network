Alan Pardew becomes new Crystal Palace boss as Newcastle United thrash out £2million compensation deal with Eagles

Why? Why would any manager swap Newcastle United for a relegation scrap at Crystal Palace?

More still, why would Alan Pardew choose to do so? Here is a man who harbours ambition of managing England and prickles at suggestion he will not. He is the same man who once belittled the romantic notion of a return to Selhurst Park. He was looking up, not down.

That dismissal, however, was delivered back in August. It was pre-protest, pre-poison.

Four months on and, on the eve of 2015, Pardew’s new year had promised the same old problems; supporter unrest, a denial of transfer funds and the threat of star players being sold.

For those who deal with him on an almost daily basis, last week’s decision to voice concern over the strength of his striking options was not in keeping with the usual soundings of Pardew the politician. It hinted at frustration, for never did he use a public platform to send a message to the boardroom.

Pardew’s remit at Newcastle was two-fold: keep the club in the Premier League and do not speak out against owner Mike Ashley. To that end, he had been the perfect employee, evidenced by Ashley’s faith during the terrace uprising which followed a seven-game winless start to the campaign.

Pardew, though, had lost faith in his existence as black-and-white diplomat, caught in the middle of a disconnect between club and fanbase with the regime resented by supporters.

Moussa Sissoko could leave in January after Arsenal and Paris Saint-Germain declared an interest

Steve Bruce - Boyhood Newcastle fan and under pressure at Hull. Would work under Mike Ashley and gets on well with chief scout Graham Carr. 4/1 

Tony Pulis – Out of work and an attractive proposition for Ashley in that respect. Thought to be interested. 7/2

Tim Sherwood – Would jump at the chance and possibility of bringing Newcastle favourite Les Ferdinand with him would be popular with supporters. 10/1

Steve McClaren – Doing a fine job at Derby and is respected within St James’ Park. He would find lure of return to Premier League hard to resist. 16/1

Glenn Hoddle – Has emerged as a popular choice among Toon Army and current QPR coach might fancy shot at top job. 20/1 

Fabricio Coloccini - The 32-year-old Argentine has been at the club since 2008 and could be given job on interim basis. 15/8

The level of vitriol to which he was exposed earlier in the season may have been forgotten amid the winning run which followed, but clearly it was not forgiven. It hurt Pardew, and he’s as resilient as they come.

When the abuse spilled over into his family life, his demeanour changed. He made a point of stating that a line had been crossed. On reflection, perhaps he crossed a line of his own that day.

This, of course, came at a time when protest website SackPardew.com was dominating the news agenda and fans were being mobilised to chase the manager from Tyneside.

But Pardew would not quit – not, at least, with his reputation having taken such a battering and his team bottom of the division.

Rather, he kept his counsel, praised the players who were underperforming and praised, too, those supporters who had chosen to stick with his team. He was dignified and won admirers because of it.

The upshot was six wins on the spin and a Manager of the Month prize for November. Reputation restored. Stock strengthened.

May, 2012: Wins Premier League and LMA Manager of the Year after guiding Magpies to fifth.

Aug, 2012: Pushes a linesman on opening day of season but later apologies and calls his behaviour ‘ridiculous’.

May, 2013: Europa League run ends at quarter-final stage but slump in league form sees United finish 16th.

Jan, 2014: Verbally abuses Manchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini, calling him a ‘f***ing old c**t’. Again, he later apologises.

Mar, 2014: Headbutts Hull’s David Meyler and is fined £100,000 by the club and given seven-game touchline ban and £60,000 fine by FA.

May, 2014: Newcastle lose seven of final eight matches to finish in 10th and supporters call for Pardew to be sacked.

Dec, 2014: Becomes the first manager in Newcastle’s history to lose four consecutive Tyne-Wear derbies.

Dec, 2014: Quits United after four years in charge and returns to former club Crystal Palace.

Pardew might make a lot of mistakes – he’s shoved a linesman, headbutted an opposition player and called another manager an ‘old c**t’ – but he’s not daft when it comes to his public perception. He did, after all, survive the fallout from the above crime sheet thanks to swift apology and self-imposed penalties.

He knows, too, how quickly things can change. And, with the trials of autumn having ranked as ‘the worst of his career’, he did not want to experience such ridicule again.

Before Sunday’s 3-2 victory over Everton, it was threatening to venture down that unsavoury avenue once more.

There had been four straight defeats, including a fourth consecutive loss in Tyne-Wear derbies and the sorry surrender of their stay in the League Cup, thrashed 4-0 at Spurs.

In the wake of the 1-0 defeat to Sunderland on December 21 Pardew had cut a weary figure and privately expressed fear of another revolt.

To the backdrop of this there was a board meeting to determine the club’s transfer strategy for January. With the team residing in the relative comfort of mid-table, investment in the playing squad was not deemed a priority.

So what was? Keep things ticking over - stay in the Premier League and do not speak out against the hierarchy, of course. It was a sad cycle which showed no signs of breaking under Ashley and the new manager will have to sign up to this Magpie mandate.

In short, there is no ambition. No ambition to be better than tenth and duck out of the cup competitions when they threaten to kill the cash cow which is top-flight football.

Pardew knew as much. He had operated within those confines for four years, all the while acting as a lightning rod should a storm brew on the terraces.

He’d had enough. But why Palace? Crucially, there is a vision which extends beyond a balance sheet. There is the promise of a dream, growth as opposed to endurance. There is control of transfers. There is love, admiration, respect. There is safety, for him and his family. There is home.

But forget the pull of Palace, the push of Newcastle was the key to Pardew’s shock decision to quit the comfort of his eight-year contract.

It should sound as a warning for any candidate readying a CV for delivery to St James' Park.
