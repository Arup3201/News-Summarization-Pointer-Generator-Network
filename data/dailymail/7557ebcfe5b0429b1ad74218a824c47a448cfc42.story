Sensitive: Cara Delevingne's psoriasis, circled, on the Milan catwalk earlier this year

She has made a lucrative career out of appearing flawless on the catwalk.

But Cara Delevingne has hinted she may quit the fashion industry because she suffers from psoriasis.

The 21-year-old told how Kate Moss encouraged her to seek medical advice after spotting her condition at Paris Fashion Week in March.

The stress-induced skin condition, which causes unsightly red sores, had flared up while they were working together.

Miss Delevingne said: ‘It only 
happened during the Fashion Weeks, which are, of course, the worst time 
of year for me to be covered in scabs. Psoriasis is an auto-immune 
disease, and I’m sensitive.

‘Kate Moss saw me before the Louis Vuitton show at 3am when I was being painted by people to cover the scabs.

‘She said, “This is horrible! Why is this happening? I need to help you”. She got me a doctor that afternoon.’

Onlookers had already noticed the 
sores at a Versace show at Milan Fashion Week in February, but assumed 
they were bruises. After the show, Miss Delevingne tweeted: ‘Be gone 
psoriasis, you’re no fun.’

The model now has career plans that 
will be kinder to her skin. She said: ‘I want to make music, I want to 
act and I want to sing. I want to do something that doesn’t make my skin
 erupt.’

She already has some experience as an 
actress, appearing as a minor character in last year’s adaptation of 
Anna Karenina, and is rumoured to have auditioned for a role in the 
forthcoming film of the erotic best-seller Fifty Shades of Grey.

An interview with W magazine also saw Miss Delevingne 
discuss her early flair for performing: at 17 she submitted an audition 
tape for Tim Burton's adaptation of Alice in Wonderland.

She
 admits her interpretation was 'a little crazy' and 'overplayed', and in
 any case, she lost out on the lead role to Mia Wasikowska - but it 
seems she still made an impression.

Psoriasis is a skin condition that causes red, flaky, crusty patches of skin covered with silvery scales.

It can start at any age but develops most often between the ages of 11 and 45.

There is no cure and the cause of the autoimmune disorder is unknown.

Dr Ellie Cannon says the condition flares up periodically - often triggered by stress - though frequency and severity varies according to the patient.

'Psoriasis can be itchy but less so than eczema,' she wrote in the Mail On Sunday. 'Some people have psoriasis that affects only the scalp or the nails. . .

'We don't know what causes it but a third of sufferers have a close relative with it, implying a genetic cause.'

Treatment is typically a combination of steroid creams, vitamin D-based moisturisers and coal-tar preparations. Sunshine and light therapy are also used to treat the condition.

Not long afterwards, she recalls, she was approached by Lili Zanuck, the wife of the film's producer, at a wedding.

'She
 told me that they all loved my tape!' Miss Delevingne said. 'And I went to 
Tim Burton’s house and met with him. I didn’t get the part, but that 
experience lit a fire in me.'

The supermodel is not the first high-profile figure to have struggled with psoriasis. In 2011, Kim Kardashian was diagnosed with the skin condition, which she inherited from her mother.

The reality star was devastated as she learned the news on an episode of Keeping Up With The Kardashians.

'My career is doing ad campaigns and swimsuit photo shoots,' the 32-year-old cried. 'People don't understand the pressure on me to look perfect.

'When I gain a pound, it's in the headlines. Imagine what the tabloids would do to me if they saw all these spots?'

Britney Spears is also thought to suffer 
from psoriasis, after she was spotted with the telltale flaky patches of
 skin on her leg last year.

It certainly does not help Miss Delevingne that the condition is triggered by stress.

She is a self-confessed workaholic who 
claims she can't cope with downtime, and struggles to relax - even when 
she takes a break from work.

She admitted that a recent three-day break in Greece with her sister left her stir-crazy and lonely.

'In Greece it was a lot of couples, and I felt alone, which made me sad,' she admitted to W.

'I called Rihanna. She said, "It's easy to drown yourself
 in work. That's a form of escapism. So, if you're alone and you want to
 cry, cry." And I did.'
