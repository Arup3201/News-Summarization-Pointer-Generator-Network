NYPD chokehold victim Eric Garner's daughter has called out civil rights leader Rev Al Sharpton for being obsessed with financial gain, according to a new undercover video released Monday. 

Erica Snipes, the daughter of Eric Garner who died in Staten Island last July after a New York City Police officer put him in a chokehold, aired her complaints about Rev Sharpton, the founder of the National Action Network, during a secretly recorded conversation with two conservative activists.

The undercover video was released online Monday by right-wing filmmaker James O'Keefe's group, Project Veritas.

Heart-to-heart: Erica Snipes, 24, told undercover investigators with James O'Keefe's right-wig group Project Veritas last month that Rev Al Sharpton was 'all about money' 

Harsh words: Snipes accused Cynthia Davis, director of the National Action Networks' Staten Island branch of lashing out at her for handing out fliers about the Garner case that did not feature the NAN logo

Snipes said because Sharpton's organization paid for her father's funeral (pictured), they were now trying to make it seem as if she owed them something 

The nearly 8-minute-long video also includes interviews with other African-American community leaders and activities, most of whom had something negative to say about Rev Sharpton.

O'Keefe's group caught up with Miss Snipes in January at a protest held at the St George Ferry Terminal in Staten Island.

'You think Al Sharpton is kind of like a crook in a sense?' one of the undercover investigators posing as an Eric Garner supporter asked Erica Snipes.

'He's about this,' Snipes replied rubbing her thumb and index finger together in a universal sign symbolizing money.

'He's about money with you?' the Project Veritas staffer asked, to which Snipes, 24, replied in the affirmative.

Walk-back: Snipes, 24, has since denied she had claimed that Rev Sharpton was greedy

Eric Garner's eldest daughter then went on to criticize Cynthia Davis, director of the National Action Networks' Staten Island branch, claiming that Sharpton’s henchwoman once lashed out at her for handing out fliers about the Garner case that did not feature the NAN logo.

'Instead of me, he wants his face in front,' Snipes said in the video, referring to Sharpton.

She then added that because Sharpton's organization covered her father's funeral expenses in July, they were now trying to make it seem as if Snipes was indebted to them.

On Monday night, Ms Snipes denied in an interview with the New York Post that she had claimed Al Sharpton was grasping, but she did not back away from her criticism of Cynthia Davis,

On his part, Rev Sharpton, 60, accused James O'Keefe's conservative group of 'exploiting' Eric Garner's daughter, whom he described as a 'sincere victim.’

‘They’re splicing and dicing stuff together,’ he said. ‘It was a distortion.’

Mr Sharpton insisted that his organization, which is dedicated to helping small businesses and low-income families, does not take money from them.

The 60-year-old MSNBC talk show host also addressed the logo kerfuffle, explaining that NAN secures permits for rallies, and therefore requires that its symbol be featured on materials promoting events it sponsors. 

Bishop Calvin Scott, of Believers Temple in Ferguson, Missouri, accused Sharpton of inciting protesters 

Darryl Parks, an attorney linked to the Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown cases, conceded that 'there may be little truth to that', when asked if Sharpton was 'all about the money'

The Project Vertias moles also got an earful about Rev Sharpton's perceived shortcomings from activists involved in the Michael Brown shooting in Missouri and Trayvon Martin's killing in Florida.

'To some degree, he sort of incites people for the wrong reason,' Bishop Calvin Scott, of Believers Temple in Ferguson, Missouri, said in the video.

Darryl Parks, an attorney linked to the Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown cases, conceded that 'there may be little truth to that', when asked if Sharpton was 'all about the money.'

On Monday night, Parks said his comments were taken out of context and insisted that he supports Sharpton.

Jean Petrus, a donor to the Trayvon Martin Foundation, sounded a similar note Monday, claiming that he was caught in an 'entrapment situation' when asked about Sharpton during a recent fundraiser.

In the undercover footage, Mr Petrus said of the civil rights leader: 'He knows how to make money and get money... They’re shakedown guys to me.'
