Four tourists were rescued from a crocodile-infested river by the quick thinking of two locals who claim the men owe them a carton of beer as thanks.

Craig Humphris and his son Andrew saw the men in the centre of the Howard River in Darwin, where the tourists had walked during low tide.

Locals to the Northern Territory, Mr Humphris and his son knew the men would be in trouble when the tide turned.

The river is home to crocodiles, sharks and stingrays, which the experienced seaman knew would pose a threat to the men. 

The tide, which is estimated to be seven metres high, began rolling in and Mr Humphris started filming the action.

'There’s four guys, they’re bloody idiots,' he said in the footage.

'Now they’ve gotta walk through the incoming tide on the Howard River to get out.'

The men soon realised they were trapped and attempted to walk back out of the river from the direction they had walked in.

'By the time we told the boys to run, to get back out of the river before the tide came up, it was a matter of 15 minutes max before they were actually stranded in the middle of the river,' Mr Humphris told ABC’s Tales From The Tinny.

'These guys are going to get swept away in about five minutes.'

Mr Humphris said that he thought the men were going to die, as the river was rolling in extremely quickly and could have swept them away

'They are in deep s**t. They are in deeper s**t than Batman,” Mr Humphris told his son Andrew in the video.

Mr Humphris said that he thought the men were going to die, as the river was rolling in extremely quickly and could have swept them away.  

'All they could do was traipse across the other side of the river, into the mangroves, and try and get high.'

Mr Humphris quickly called the police to the aid of the four men, who arrived and were able to help rescue the men from the mangroves.  

'There’s a loty of new people in town, they don’t understande the strength of the rivers... they don’t understand what a spring tide is,' Mr Humphris said. 

'They owe Andrew and myself a nice carton of cold beer.'
