The life of a former Jihadist who became a double-agent for MI5 is set to be turned into a Hollywood blockbuster.

Bourne Identity director Paul Greengrass is rumoured to be leading the project, based on Danish-born Morten Stormâ€™s autobiography; Agent Storm: My Life Inside Al Qaeda and the CIA.

Storm, 38, hit the headlines earlier this year with his non-fiction book, which follows his journey from a violent youth in Denmark via radical Islamism to life as a spy.

A member of a biker gang in his home country, Storm moved to Britain in the late 90s and converted to Islam.

After falling in with controversial hate preachers such as Sheik Omar Bahri Muhammad in London and Luton, developed extreme jihadist views.

Storm then moved to Yemen in 2001 and grew close to al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula leader Anwar al-Awlaki.

As he became trusted by fundamentalists, he met shoe bomber Richard Reid and, at one point, was offered the chance to meet Osama Bin Laden.

Game on: The film about Morten Storm is set to be directed by Brit Paul Greengrass, who is the man behind the Bourne-trilogy and Captain Phillips

In his book he reveals he turned his back on fundamentalists after he was prevented from travelling to fight in Somalia in 2006.

He was stunned that he had been denied what he considered his fate and looked up 'contradictions in the Koran' on the internet in frustration.

In an interview with BBC's Newsnight, broadcast last night, he said: 'Once I had researched the contradictions, I finally realised how misguided I was and what a danger my associates were for the free world.'

He was later recruited by the CIA, MI5 and the Danish intelligence service, PET, as a double agent to inform on operations in Yemen and Somalia and prevent attacks in Europe.

Storm's life is rumoured to be brought to the big screen by Paul Greengrass, director of the Bourne Identity spy-trilogy, The Guardian reports.

Sony Pictures are said to have bought the rights to turn the book into a film after Greengrass took it to American producer Scott Rudin, who worked with him on the Oscar-nominated Captain Phillips.
