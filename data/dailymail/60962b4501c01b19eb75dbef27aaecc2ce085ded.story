A Victorian snake handler who was banned from performing live shows after letting snakes repeatedly bite his daughter can reapply for his licence.

Raymond Hoser, 52, was stripped of his licence to perform with snakes because he allowed a taipan and death adder to bite his 12-year-old daughter seven times in a show at a Melbourne shopping centre.

The snakes had undergone a procedure to remove their venom glands, but the bites drew blood.

The 52-year-old man has had his performing licence re-instated after it was revoked when he had two deadly snakes bite his daughter during a live show

Hoser was also punished for having his snakes too close to the audience without proper barriers.

The Department of Sustainability and Environment (DSE) stripped Mr Hoser of his wildlife demonstrator and handler licence.

This decision was upheld in an appeal in the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal (VCAT).

But the Victorian Court of Appeal on Friday set aside those 2012 rulings, and will allow Mr Hoser to reapply for his licence.

This was Raymond Hoser's third appeal to the Court of Appeal in Victoria. He said the revoking of his licence meant his business lost thousands of dollars

Justices Robert Redlich and Joseph Santamaria found the VCAT rulings that Mr Hoser had reckless disregard for the public could not be sustained and failed to take account of the effect of the cancellation on his livelihood.

Hoser celebrated the success of appeal on Facebook and said his business, Snakebusters, had lost 'thousands of dollars' in income because of his licence being revoked.

This was the third time Hoser had tried to overturn the ruling in the Court of Appeal.
