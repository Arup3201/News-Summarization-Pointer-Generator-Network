A British trawler suspected of illegally dredging scallops was ordered into a French port today and her captain threatened with prison.

In the latest round of a maritime dispute between the two nations, the Van Dijck was forced to berth at Ouistreham, Normandy.

She was suspected of dredging at least 17 tons of scallops in French territorial waters.

The haul was thrown back in the sea after the French Navy carried out an on-board inspection  12 nautical miles from the coast.

Gary Smith, the Van Dijck’s skipper, faces charges of violating French 
territorial waters while switching off his monitoring system in an 
effort to avoid arrest.

The two crimes carry a maximum sentence of one year in prison and fines 
of £80,000.

Mr Smith insists that he had to turn 
off his so-called transponder to stop other vessels following him into 
French waters after he miscalculated his position.

But he now has to pay 50,000 euros (£40,740) bail to get back to the UK before a French court hearing on May 15 in Caen.

The Royal Navy was deployed to protect British fishermen during the Cod Wars with Iceland in  the 1970s.

In 1972, Iceland had declared an Exclusive Economic Zone beyond its own territorial waters while announcing plans to reduce over-fishing.

This led to the Icelandic Coastguard cutting the nets of British trawlers that fished in the area.

The UK retaliated by deploying Royal Navy warships to protect British fishing crews.

There followed a number of stand-offs between UK and Icelandic vessels, which included them ramming each other.

The lengthy dispute finally  ended in 1976 when Iceland threatened to close a vital Nato base in retaliation for the deployment  of the Navy.

The British Government conceded that UK vessels would no longer fish within the disputed 200- nautical-mile limit.

The Van Dijck is now under guard in 
Ouistreham, which is Caen’s port, with French prosecutor Bruno Albisetti
 confirming that Mr Smith claims he  ‘miscalculated his position by 
failing to take into account low tide’.

The owner of the Van Dijck tonight said the ship's incursion was a mistake.

Andrew McCloud added: 'My skipper strayed into French territory. The limit is 12 miles and she was about 11.6 miles.'

In October, the Van Dijck was one of five British trawlers attacked by Gallic fishermen brandishing iron bars, flares and rocks.

A force made up of some 40 French boats steamed into them while they were trying to collect scallops off the port of Le Havre.

The British insisted they had been 
fishing legally in international waters, while the French say they were 
encroaching into their own waters, while also ruining efforts to 
preserve stocks.

Mr Smith and his crew then vowed not 
to be ‘intimated’ by threats of a  250-boat French armada blocking their
 passage through the English Channel. 

Today Richard Brouzes, head of the Lower Normandy fisherman’s organisation, OPBN, appealed for calm.

Mr Brouzes said: ‘If this boat was 
stopped then perhaps it had entered the 12-mile zone where the numbers 
of scallops are perhaps higher. It’s tempting, but error is human, and 
it’s happened before that French boats have strayed into British 
waters.’

Pointing to the fact that the scallop
 population is around 50 per cent higher than normal this year, Mr 
Brouzes said: ‘There are enough scallops for everyone. Our fisherman 
have other worries.’

But, as the Scallop Wars escalate, 
the French and British are due to hold talks over fishing rights later 
this year after a French fishing industry representative blocked a deal 
in September.

In a separate hearing on Wednesday, 
the Caen prosecutor called for a year fishing ban on a Scottish trawler,
 the Mattanja, and a fine of 20,000 euros (£16,300 ) for identical 
offences in September.

A verdict is due on January 16.

shellfish and catches

The Van Dijck is registered in Brixham, Devon, and owned by Englishman Andrew McLeod.

In October Mr McLeod said the Royal Navy should be used to protect fishermen from further attacks by the French.

Mr McLeod said: 'Protection from the Royal Navy is something we've been asking for for some time.'

He said the British had been in negotiations with the French over access to the rich scallop beds 15 miles off the coast of Caen.

The Van Dijck’s crew painted Union Jack on the boat’s side, and pledged to resist efforts by the French to intimidate them.
