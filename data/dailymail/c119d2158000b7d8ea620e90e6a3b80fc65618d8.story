Introducing himself as the 'big elf,' President Barack Obama on Wednesday exclaimed 'Ho, Ho, Ho' and made merry as he delivered a pair of giant red sacks filled with toys and other gifts to the Marine Corps' annual Toys for Tots campaign.

First lady Michelle Obama has been the traditional bearer of the gifts, which have been donated annually by White House staffers.

But this time she decided to bring a pair of extra hands to the Washington military base, Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling, where the unwrapped toys are collected. They brought about 1,000 items.

'That's a pretty serious ho, ho, ho,' Mrs. Obama said of her husband's greeting to the crowd in the taped encounter, a video of which appeared online.

'We're going to break you in slowly, okay?' she also said to the president at the event.

Here he is! President Obama carried toys with him to help his wife First lady Michelle Obama with a toy drive for the Marine Corps' annual Toys for Tots campaign

Generous: About 1,000 items were brought to the military base on Wednesday 

New identity? Obama called himself 'the big elf' at the toy drive 

She also said 'One of the challenges is making sure that we have enough toys for the older kids. It's always fun to buy the Barbie dolls and the coloring books, but we have to remember that there are teenagers out there too that need those gifts.

'And we try to make it a point to make sure that we're buying cool clothes for kids and electronic products and educational materials for teenagers as well.' 

'I'm the big elf, I'm like Will Ferrell,' Obama said as he introduced himself. He thanked the Marine Corps for starting the annual toy drive in the 1940s.

Since then, the Toys for Tots campaign has distributed more than 469 million toys to more than 216 million less fortunate children, Obama said.

'That's a lot of dollhouses, that's a lot of Ninja Turtles,' he said.

Before the Obamas got to work sorting the toys into boxes according to age and whether a particular item was for a boy or a girl, Mrs. Obama joked that the president might have a hard time sorting the gifts, saying he doesn't do much shopping.

'I don't know how good he'll be with sorting, because he doesn't usually deal in shopping in any kind of way,' she said. 

She continued 'But we'll watch him closely to see if he can figure out which ones are girls' zero-to-two or unisex. It gets really complicated, so watch him, because he could really make your work harder.' 

Obama said he was 'positive' that the 'Call of Duty' video game was perfect for girls, zero to two.

'Isn't that right?" he asked Mrs. Obama.

The joke was lost on the first lady, who confessed: 'I wasn't listening.'

Can he do it? Mrs. Obama joked that the president might have a hard time sorting the gifts, saying he doesn't do much shopping
