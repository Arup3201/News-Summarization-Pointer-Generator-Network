A Spanish biker has filed a formal complaint over a traffic accident involving Michael Schumacher weeks before the F1 starâ€™s horror ski crash.

Schumacher is accused of knocking the motorcyclist off his bike after failing to give way at a roundabout in Bormujos near Seville.

The unnamed Spaniard is claiming compensation for the broken wrist he suffered and damage to a watch, his clothes and his motorbike in the accident on November 17 last year.

Michael Schumacher is being sued by a Spanish motorcyclist after the F1 star allegedly knocked him off his bike when failing to give way at a roundabout while driving an Audi rental car weeks before his ski accident

Schumacher, who has been named in the complaint along with the company that hired him the rented Audi A4 he was driving and its insurers, has been in a medically-induced coma since suffering a head injury in a French Alps fall on December 29 last year.

A trial will only take place if insurers contest the claim and the 45-year-old German would not be obliged to attend.

Police have said in their accident report the seven-time F1 champion, who was on a private visit to Spain, failed to respect his alleged victim's right of way.

Poor lighting on the approach to the roundabout has also been blamed.

Last week, Schumacher's family were given the smashed helmet he wore on the day of his ski accident.

Doctors caring for him have rebutted claims his injuries may have been worsened because the helicopter that took him from the ski resort of Meribel to Grenoble hospital made a stopover at a smaller hospital en route.

Schumacher's manager Sabine Kehm has said Michael is making progress.

She said at the start of the month: 'He shows moments of consciousness and awakening.

'We are on his side, together with the team of the hospital in Grenoble, and we keep remaining confident.'

She also rubbished claims his wife Corinna had plans to build a medical suite for him at their Swiss home.
