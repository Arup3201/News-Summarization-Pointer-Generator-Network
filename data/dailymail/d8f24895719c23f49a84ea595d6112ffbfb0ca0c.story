He's about to make the biggest move of his life, trading his long career with Liverpool FC for US club Los Angeles Galaxy.

And Steven Gerrard looks just about ready to live in the lap of luxury when he relocates to the West coast of the States this summer with his family.

One sprawling Malibu mansion the footballer has reportedly viewed with wife Alex and children has been unveiled, an outstanding property overlooking the ocean which used to belong to The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star Yolanda Foster.

The family will reside in Los Angeles for 18 months while he plays out his contract with the team, and although it's a long way from his home in Merseyside, there's no doubt the family will feel incredibly comfortable in the not-so-humble abode.

Reportedly worth $25m - £16.8m - the luxurious pad is said to have been offered to the midfielder, 34, by his new football club, who'll foot the $20,000 a week (£13,400) rent over the 18-month period he's signed to the team.

Steven, along with his model wife Alex, 32, and their daughters Lilly-Ella, ten, eight-year-old Lexie and Lourdes, three, are already said to be building themselves a £3million five-bedroom house on a two-acre site in an upscale area in Merseyside.

But that doesn't much compare to their potential American property, which they could be set to move into in early June after the sportsman's long and illustrious career with Liverpool comes to an end in late May.

With six bedrooms and nine bathrooms, the swanky property also boasts sweeping mountain and Pacific Ocean views and was regularly featured on reality show The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills.

Yolanda Foster and her music producer husband David had the modern property custom-built to their taste in 2009, and resided there with the 51-year-old star's three children, including model Gigi Hadid.

The property, reportedly worth £16.8m, includes six bedrooms, nine bathrooms and plenty of  living space

Gerrard's new home is just a short 15 minutes from beach-perfect Santa Monica

Located in the resplendent area of Carbon Canyon in Malibu, near to Los Angeles International Airport and just a short 15 minutes from beach-perfect Santa Monica, it seems the Gerrard family will have lots to keep them occupied over the next year and a half.

The large house also includes separate exercise, massage and sauna areas inside, and also a magnificent infinity pool outside.

There's a sizable barbecue area too, and a garage big enough for three cars, housed in its own private orchards of citrus and avocado trees.

The stylish home also includes a screening room for those big-movie moments, and a 'sports room', with a full-sized billiards table and bar, for when Steven wants to forget about football after work and let his proverbial hair down. 

The house is perfect for entertaining, and US reality star Yolanda had a professional chef’s kitchen build with a custom floor-to-ceiling glass refrigerator.

In the official pictures of the impressive property, it is clear it's finished to an incredibly high standard, a combination of both contemporary and classic design, with a deluxe Californian and certainly Hollywood-style vibe.

It's going to be a huge adjustment process for both Steven and his family, but he's not the first British footballer to make such a move: David Beckham famously left Madrid to play with LA Galaxy back in 2007, and he moved his entire family out to Los Angeles for the job.

The MLS team recently confirmed Steven's signing following his decision to turn down the offer of a contract extension and leave Liverpool after 17 years with his beloved team.

'Football is my life and will continue to be for a couple of years,' he said on confirming his move.

'I'm not going over there for a holiday or to enjoy myself. I'm going over there to win, and if I win and play well, then my life becomes more enjoyable.

'There's obviously a bonus of where the LA Galaxy are located as well. That will be nice for my family to come out of our comfort zone and try something different.' 

Gerrard scored twice from the penalty spot during Liverpool's Foundation charity match on Sunday

And a senior Galaxy official confirmed: 'The club is helping Steven and Alex with every imaginable aspect of their family move and we are obviously hoping to get them settled as soon as possible.' 

Alex returned to Liverpool last month after jetting to Los Angeles in search of a new home for her, her husband and their adorable girls.

Tweeting shortly before she returned, she wrote: 'Last day in LA coming home tonight !! VIlla Blanca for lunch then last few bits of shopping, looking forward to seeing my man and girls.' 

And it seems like the move can't come quick enough for the Gerrard family.

Alex, who has been married to the footballer since 2007, recently tweeted her disdain for the typical British rain, something she surely won't miss when moving to sunny California in June.

'Wish this rain would do one !!!' she wrote on Twitter while watching her man play in the All-Star Charity match at Liverpool's Anfield on Sunday.

MailOnline has contacted a representative for Steven Gerrard and is awaiting comment.
