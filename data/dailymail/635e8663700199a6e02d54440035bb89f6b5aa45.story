Children of the 80s will stand in awe that a working hoverboard is finally a reality, but is it stable enough for skateboard legend Tony Hawk to master?

Turns out the answer is yes, though even Hawk took a bit to find his comfort zone on the board.

Hawk showed off his moves in a new video showcasing the new technology from California company Arx Pax.

The Ride Channel reports that the hoverboard tech 'relies on magnets, which means the hoverboard can, for the time being, only hover over non-ferrous materials'

The device basically works on magnetic surfaces but the company hopes to ideally get it working in other areas

The Ride Channel reports that the hoverboard tech 'relies on magnets, which means the hoverboard can, for the time being, only hover over non-ferrous materials.'

'Right now, what we have is essentially the Model-T [of hoverboards],' said This is a proof of concept. And because we made this big leap in efficiency, we are able now to do what other folks couldn’t do on a conductive material like aluminum or copper. As we optimize this system, ideally we’ll be able to go on other surfaces.' Greg Henderson.

Once used to the technology, Hawk was able to ride the 90-pound board up and down the studio's pipe and even pull off a few tricks

Hawk managed to perform a number of tricks though the board wasn't the easiest to ride

Once used to the technology, Hawk was able to ride the 90-pound board up and down the studio's pipe and even pull off a few tricks. 

And while it wasn't the easiest device to ride, the fact that it exists at all is cause to celebrate. 

That a working hoverboard exists at all should please children of the 80s
