Choosing the best way to propose is never easy - but in the modern age, with twitter and other social networks running much of our social lives, it can be even tougher deciding how to pop the question and keep your plans quiet.

However, for Guy Malachi, an Israeli entrepreneur, Facebook's status updates gave him the perfect vehicle to propose.

Mr Malachi, 36, decided to propose to girlfriend Eva, who is 30, using Facebook in a unique way.

Guy Malachi, right, used Facebook's status updates to propose to girlfriend Eva, lift - hacking her laptop so she was asked if she wanted to change her relationship status

'When I decided to propose to my girlfriend I knew it would be geeky,' he said

'Not Star Wars geeky, I'm not that hardcore, but something geeky nonetheless.

'I threw around a few ideas, I knew I wanted to surprise her out of the blue, I wanted to do something that required investment (and not just half-ass it), but I didn't want it to be too grandiose (we're both not into those kinds of things).

Mr Malachi eventually decided on Facebook, and set about writing some code that would hijack her laptop, allowing him to fool her into thinking she was receiving real Facebook messages when, in fact, they were written by him.

'Since this was a marriage proposal, the obvious place to mess with her on Facebook was the relationship status.'

Malachi's proposal hijacked his girlfriend's Facebook feed, fooling her into thinking she was receive real requests. First, he asked her for some basic information

He then asked her to confirm her relationship status - with a menu that showed Married, whatever menu option was chosen

Each time Eva selected single, it showed her this message

The software, controlled by Malachi, then asked her to select her husband, showing a selection of their friends

The image then changed to a picture of Guy - at which point he appeared in front of the screen with a ring

'She was floored :),' wrote Mr Malachi.

'She had no idea till that second what was going on - luckily for me, she said yes!'

'A few minutes of mushiness ensued while we collected ourselves and indulged in the moment, and then I explained to her how the whole thing worked.

'To top all this off, the next thing I obviously had to do was update my Twitter with the good news and that was how my Mum found out I proposed.

'When I called her to tell her the good news she answered saying "I need to discover on Twitter that you proposed?". She was a great sport about it.'

'From the moment I decided I want to propose till the actual proposal was a bit less than 2 weeks,' Mr Malachi told MailOnline.

'The actual development took about a week, and a few more days before that for creating the design and specs for how it should behave.'
