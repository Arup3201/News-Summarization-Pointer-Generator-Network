Martin 'Mad Dog' Allen returns with 
the latest installment of his weekly column for MailOnline Sport. The 
Barnet boss does not hold back with his views on current issues in 
football.

THE BOY NEEDS HELP

As a manager you're dealing with problems and situations with your players day in day out.

Many of them you keep out of the public eye if possible.

Hungry: Luis Suarez was banned for four months by FIFA after biting Giorgio Chiellini on Tuesday

I prefer to try my utmost to get them help, support and guidance with the assistance of the Professional Footballers' Association and the Sporting Chance Clinic.

Luis Suarez has quite clearly got some major issues going on in his life which he and Liverpool have to face up to.

He fell into Giorgio Chiellini? That's rubbish. Hold your hands up. Admit you've got issues. Sit down and deal with them.

His rabid, animal-type behaviour is unacceptable.

It reminds me a couple of weeks ago when I was on holiday and a little boy had his ice cream snatched out of his hand by his older brother.

VIDEO I didn't mean to bite - Suarez

The little kid chomped his older brother's arm and just walked off.

Maybe Luis had his ice cream nicked off him when he was a little kid!

Whatever is the reason for his biting habit, he needs sort it out.

LUIS IS BAD, BUT IT COULD BE WORSE

Australian rugby league player Anthony Watts was accused of biting an opponent in the unmentionables last year.

It was in a Gold Coast league game between Tugun Seahawks and Bilambil Jets.

I was reading about it in a newspaper while on holiday. Watts denied it, but he was handed an eight-match ban.

SAINTS STRIPPED

At the end of last season it looked like a very exciting time to be a Southampton supporter, player or member of staff.

Now new manager Ronald Koeman is faced with a very tough task.

With Nicola Cortese leaving six months ago, Rickie Lambert gone to Liverpool, Luke Shaw to Manchester United, with Adam Lallana set for Liverpool and Morgan Schneiderlin looking on his way to Arsenal, those core, key players will be very difficult to replace.

The owner, Katharina Liebherr, will be absolutely delighted to have banked more than £60m.

But for Southampton fans it is worrying times for them after an incredible ride over the last few years.

I fear, unless Koeman works miracles, they won't be far off relegation next season.

WORLD CUP WOES

The World Cup is an amazing event, but with England out it really does gnash me off.

It's just not the same when we're not in it anymore and all the players have come home.

Who will win it? I think it'll be the Germans.

They are disciplined, honest, mobile, athletic, can defend set plays, are strong in the air and they have a team spirit that will continue to grind out results.

A lot of people are backing Brazil, and I'm sure they will go close, but at some point David Luiz will make a massive mistake – he always does – and that'll be it for them.

Always deliver: Martin Allen has backed Germany to go on and win the World Cup

My week...

My last week on holiday has been spent constantly on the phone, trying to find players through their agents to put a decent team together at Barnet.

A manager never rests. The job never stops.

We're starting pre-season on Thursday and all my focus is trying to build a team, like a jigsaw puzzle. I'm trying to put together all the ingredients for success.

When signing players, you're trying to find speed, experience, good character, reliability, a few personalities, a few on their way out, a couple on their way down.

As Harry Redknapp once said to me, you can't have 11 choir boys in your team.
