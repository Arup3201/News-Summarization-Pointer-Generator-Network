Juventus and Roma are set to battle it out for Manchester City defender Matija Nastasic.

The central-defender has been told he can leave the Etihad Stadium this summer after falling down the pecking order.

And Serie A giants are interested in signing the Serbia international ahead of the transfer deadline.

A country he knows well: Nastasic has played in Italy before during a spell with Fiorentina

Nastasic is familiar with the Italian top-flight following his time with Fiorentina before moving to City.

Juve are believed to be the front-runners for the 21-year-old's signature and have enquired about his availability.

But Roma are also on red-alert as they consider their options as speculation mounts over Mehdi Benatia's future.

Arsenal have shown an interest in Nastasic, but are trying to conclude a deal for Olympiakos' Kostas Manolas.
