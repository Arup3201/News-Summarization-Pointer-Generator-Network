A giant Leatherback turtle washed up on the same South Australian beach where seven sperm whales beached themselves less than a month ago.

Friends Scott Neindorf, 21, and Blake Watkins made the discovery as they were walking along Macs Beach.

'I've never seen anything like it,' Mr Neindorf told Daily Mail Australia.

'I couldn't believe how big it was.'

South Australian Museum senior researcher Mark Hutchinson told DMA the fact the turtle washed up in the same area, not far from Ardrossan, the whales were found 'must be coincidental'.

'It's unusual to find turtles of that size this far south because of the cold but Leatherbacks are able to keep themselves warm because of this blubber layer they have, they can protect themselves.

Some Leatherbacks have been known to weigh more than 600 kilograms, however, this one is unlikely to have reached full maturity.

It's believed the turtle was up to 60 years old, weighed more than 200 kilograms and almost 2 metres in length.

South Australian Museum senior researcher Mark Hutchinson said the fact the turtle washed up in the same area (near Ardrossan) the whales were found 'must be coincidental'

'We were just walking along and just randomly come across it,' said Mr Neindorf.

'We go down there a fair bit, never seen one of them washed up on the beach, it was quite a surprise.

'I was not going to touch it, so we just lay down next to it and took some pics to show how big it actually was.

'We had a good look at it and told a few people about it. My mate was trying to get onto the fisheries to just report it.

'Apparently it might have been there for a week at least, the fins were starting to rot away, the shell was in good condition.'

While large turtles in the colder southern water are a rare find, there have been sightings before. 

'Fisherman do tell me they have seen them on occasions,' Dr Hutchinson added.

'They feed on the surface and are slow moving, feeding on jellyfish of all things, they pick quiet areas where there are currents, so if you are on a boat you do spot them sometimes.'

Seven beached sperm whales died on the Yorke Peninsula in South Australia earlier this month.  The whales were found 50 metres offshore at Parara Beach, south of Ardrossan

Locals have been shocked twice in less than a month after a Leatherback turtle was found not far from where sperm whales became beached on the Yorke Peninsula in South Australia

The museum's reptile and amphibians expert said it was likely the Leatherback had died some time ago.

'It probably died out at sea and the currents have brought it in. Unlike the whales who actively beached themselves, once is passive and the other active,' he said.

'They tend to be solo when spotted, it's ideal spot for feeding but you do sometimes get a couple of animals come in together.

'Unfortunately there are several reasons why they die, it can be in a collision with a boat, drown when caught up in gear or they can die when eating plastic bags which they can mistake for the translucent things they normally feed on.'
