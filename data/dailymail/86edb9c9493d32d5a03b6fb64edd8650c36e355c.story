The origins of an enormous rocky moose, which is only clearly visible from the sky, has baffled archaeologists since it was discovered in 2011.

But now experts say that children from a lost civilisation helped to create the huge antlered artwork 6,000 years ago.

The moose, which lies close to Lake Zyuratkul in the southern Ural Mountains of Russia, is the world’s oldest known geoglyph.

Man-made moose: Experts say that children from a lost civilisation helped to create the huge antlered artwork (pictured) 6,000 years ago. The moose is only visible from the sky and is the world's oldest geoglyph

It is made from stone and predates Peru's famous Nazca Lines by thousands of years.

The geoglyph was found in 2011 using satellite images of the area and is older than British equivalents such as the White Horse in Uffington, Oxfordshire or the Cerne Abbas Giant in Dorset, archaeologists have confirmed.

‘The most interesting development is that tools found at the site indicate it was worked on assiduously by children as well as adults in a large-scale community accomplishment,’ The Siberian Times reported. 

Stone tools uncovered in recent archaeological digs at the site show that some were made to fit the hands of children who took part in a massive community effort to construct the moose, which stretches for about 902ft (275 metres) and depicts an animal with four legs, antlers and a long muzzle.

What: A large moose design made on the ground from rocks that is visible from a height.

Location: Near Lake Zyuratkul in the southern Ural mountains, Russia.

Age: 6,000 years.

Architects: An unknown ancient civilisation. Tools indicate that children helped build it.

Length: 902ft (275 metres).

Discovered: In 2011 from satellite images.

Raison d'être: A mystery. Experts suspect the creation of the geoglyph was linked with worship.

Stanislav Grigoryev, a senior researcher from the Chelyabinsk History and Archaeology Institute, said: 'Judging by the different sizes of the tools - from 17cm-long and weighing about three kilograms to some being just two centimetres - we can assume they were used by both adults and children.

'We can also assume it means that everyone participated in creating the moose.

'But it was not a kind of slave labour of children. They were involved to share common values, to join something important to all the people.'

Some 155 implements have been found near the geoglyph, mostly for digging or breaking stones.

Despite the discovery of small tools, scientists are still puzzled about exactly who built the moose and why.

No-body knows why ancient people created the geoglyph (illustrated) which stretches for about 902 ft (275 metres). Theories include that it was used to worship gods, denote postcodes, or even attract aliens

They assume it was made to impress the gods in ancient times, but local archaeologists have failed to find evidence of ‘a culture with sufficient refinement’ which would have been able to construct it between 3,000BC and 4,000BC.

‘The figure would initially have looked white and slightly shiny against the green grass background,’ said Dr Grigoryev.

Researchers hope that they will unearth ceramics at the site, giving them clues as to the identity of the mystery civilisation.

‘It may help if we find ceramics on the site. Ceramics could help us with the date and with understanding who these people were that created the geoglyph,’ he said.

‘It's not quite clear who the builders were. It is obvious that its creation has a big social importance. Geoglyphs are the symbols of unity.’

Local archaeological digs by the nearby lake found no evidence of a population likely to have built the moose.

‘People have lived here since the Neolithic era but there was no sign of large social structures, nor that they did anything other than hunting and fishing,’ Dr Grigoryev.

Different sized tools (pictured) found near the geoglyph indicate that its creation was a community effort and not a kind of slave labour for children. 'They were involved to share common values, to join something important to all the people,' Dr Grigoryev said.

‘So it puzzles me very much. It is a kind of mystery: who built this and for what purpose?’

The research team found traces of two ancient fireplaces at the site of the moose, both used only once, possibly in a significant ritual, he said.

‘The geoglyphs in Nazca are younger as are those in the UK, though there might be some of comparable age in Britain,’ he added.

‘But at the moment Zyuratkul's is the most ancient, and is the world's largest figure image.

‘By figure image we mean geometrical or zoomorphic figures, because there are very long lines in Nasca, and here we speak about the figure. So it's not the largest geoglyph, but the largest figure image.

‘It could become a tourist attraction and with a museum, but we need to think how it might be implemented."

Some 50 geoglyphs with various shapes and sizes, including a massive swastika, were recently discovered across northern Kazakhstan.

Some archaeologists say geoglyphs were designed to represent the important stars, planetary events like sun solstices, or constellations (illustrated)

A number of theories have been put forward on why ancient man built the geoglyphs.

Geoglyphs are large designs made on the ground from  rocks or durable elements of the landscape, such as stones, stone fragments, live trees, gravel, or earth. They often form animals and can be most easily seen from the sky, or a high viewpoint.

Worship: They are seen as an early form of statue, used for religious worship. This might apply to the Long Man of Wilmington, in England, which is thought to date as far back as 2,000BC and is the tallest in Europe. Some experts say the figure is a representation of an Anglo Saxon war god and the site is considered sacred by Pagans.

Prayer and ritual points: The discovery of fireplaces on the site of the Russian moose and other geoglyphs adds to speculation they were used for rituals. There is a theory that the Nazca used to dance along the lines of their geoglyphs when they prayed for rain, with many of the same images featuring on pottery from the time.

Ancient postcodes: Geoglyphs may have been a way in which civilisations marked their own territories in clear and visible ways. More often than they are giant structures in areas that can be seen from a distance or from a high vantage point, leading some experts to say they were used to mark ownership of the land.

Astronomy: Some archaeologists say geoglyphs were designed to represent the important stars, planetary events like sun solstices, or constellations. However a 1968 study by the National Geographic Society found that while some of the Nazca lines did point to the positions of the Sun and Moon, it was no more than could be expected by mere chance.

Aliens: A widespread yet bizarre theory sees the markings as signals to visiting aliens. Some have claimed that the straight lines of Nazca, for instance, were created as runways for spaceships, but why extra-terrestrials would attempt to land on geoglyphs in the shape of monkeys, spiders, or giant Russian moose is another question.
