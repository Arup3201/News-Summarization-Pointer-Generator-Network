David Cameron, pictured leaving Downing Street today, has told French President Francois Hollande he is 'keen' to offer more military help in Mali

David Cameron has sent his top security advisor to Paris to step up Britain’s military help for French forces fighting Islamist militants in Mali.

In what will be seen as an escalation in the UK’s commitment to the mission, the Prime Minister told French President Francois Hollande he was ‘keen’ to send in more intelligence,  transport  and logistical support.

National Security Adviser Sir Kim Darroch is in Paris today to meet his French counterparts about which extra British forces will be committed. ‘We are in discussions with France about what more we can do,’ Downing Street said.

French and Malian troops are reported to be close to securing the key city of Timbuktu as rebels fled into the desert.

The RAF has already provided two heavy-lift C17 transport planes and a Sentinel surveillance aircraft to assist France's operation.

But Mr Cameron used a phone call to Mr Hollande last night to make clear his willingness to offer more British kit and personnel to the French intervention.

‘The Prime Minister made clear that we fully support the French government’s actions working with the Malian government, at their request, to deny terrorists a safe haven in Mali,’ the PM’s official spokesman told reporters.

‘The Prime Minister went on to explain that we are keen to provide further assistance where we can, depending on what French requirements there may be.’

Sir Kim is meeting French authorities 
to discuss what further assistance Britain may be able to provide to 
them. But Downing Street insisted there would be ‘no combat role’.

Instead, Mr Cameron has offered additional logistics, intelligence and surveillance support.

On Saturday an RAF spy plane was deployed to support the French military action in Mali as forces made a significant inroad by retaking Gao airport.

The highly sophisticated Sentinel aircraft joined two giant C-17 transport aircraft which have been airlifting men and tons of supplies to the country fighting Islamist militants.

Carrying a crew of five, the Sentinel has played a vital role in counter-insurgency operations in Afghanistan and against Colonel Gaddafi in Libya.

Downing Street today stressed that military operations were only part of the solution.

‘Actually in the long-term what’s very important are the political and economic legs to improving the situation on the ground and squeezing the space and the scope for grievances that the terrorists seek to exploit,’ Mr Cameron’s spokesman said.

Last week the PM warned of a global 'generational struggle' against al Qaida-inspired Islamist terrorism in North Africa and said the UK should "thicken" links with region following this month's hostage crisis in Algeria.

He said Britain will provide troops to an EU mission to train the Malian military to take on Islamist militants who have taken over the north of the country.

The mission, due to deploy in February or March, is expected to include around 250 trainers and 250 force protection troops and Mr Cameron said the British contribution would number 'in the tens, not the hundreds', with aides saying it would be at the lower end of that range.
