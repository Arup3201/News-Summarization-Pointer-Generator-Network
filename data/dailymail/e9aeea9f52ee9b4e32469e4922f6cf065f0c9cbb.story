Former Australia captain Ricky Ponting will be exclusively writing for Sportsmail throughout this summer's Ashes series.

Ponting, one of the best batsmen to ever play the game, joins a stellar cast of writers in Paul Newman, Lawrence Booth, former England captain Nasser Hussain and former England batsman and coach David 'Bumble' Lloyd.

The 38-year-old retired from Test cricket back in December but is in England this season playing for Surrey.

You
can read Ricky's views in Wednesday's Daily Mail as the man 
affectionately known as Punter talks exclusively to Paul Newman.
