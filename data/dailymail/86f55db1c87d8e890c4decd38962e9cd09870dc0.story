The Georgia State coach whose son led the 14-seed to an upset over Baylor in the NCAA men's basketball tournament on Thursday is teasing President Barack Obama for picking his team to lose in the first round.

'I hope you make better decisions in your presidency than you did about Georgia State!' coach Ron Hunter said after the game in a Vine video.

The White House wouldn't apologize on Friday for Obama's incorrect assumption that the Baylor Bears, a 3-seed in the tournament, would prevail against the Georgia State Panthers. 

The president's spokesman did say, however that the young man who scored the winning basket 'certainly rose to the occasion.'

Coach Hunter drew nationwide attention after he toppled off of the stool from which he had been cheering on his team after son RJ hit a deep three-pointer, putting the Panthers up 57-56 with 2.7 seconds remaining.

Baylor had been favorited in the game by 9. With the younger Hunter on fire, scoring 16 points, Georgia State claimed victory in the final seconds of the game.

The Panthers had been down by 12 with less than three minutes left before surging back for a stunning comeback and winning on the junior guard, according to ESPN. 

Remarking on the surprising come-from-behind win on Friday, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said, ''That was a great shot there at the end of the game.'

'I think there’s no question that...that kind of high- level performance when the chips are down is certainly the kind of...spirit that the president would hope to summon in the context of his job, too,' he added.

Georgia State, in the NCAA tournament for the first time since 2001, was picked by few to advance to the second round. President Barack Obama had Baylor winning the game in his bracket. 'I hope you make better decisions in your presidency than you did about Georgia State!' coach Hunter said after the game, teassing the president

Coach Hunter's assistants had to help him get back into his chair after he was literally floored by his son's last minute heroics.

He had been perched on the rolling chair to reduce the strain of a Achilles tendon injury he incurred while celebrating the team's Sun Belt victory over Georgia Southern.

The proud father, 50, was wearing a cast and often tried to stand up before being restrained by other coaches during the game.

Georgia State will play No. 6 team Xavier in the next round of the NCAA tournament's West division of this year's bracket.

Their victory was the second 3-seed upset of the day, coming after UAB's one-point win over Iowa State, favored by 14 points.  

The Georgia State squad is making its first appearance in the NCAA's big dance since 2001.

Team members include former Louisville player Kevin Ware, who broke his leg at the tournament in 2013 in gruesome fashion.
