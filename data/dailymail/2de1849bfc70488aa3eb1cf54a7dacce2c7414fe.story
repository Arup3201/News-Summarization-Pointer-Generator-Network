A driver who plunged 300 feet off of a Southern California ocean cliff was rescued after firefighters waded into the surf to free him from the car.

KNBC reports the driver is a 19-year-old man from Rolling Hills Estates who told rescuers that he drove his car off the cliff at the Bluff Cove area of Palos Verdes Estates intentionally.

The man, who has not been identified, was hospitalized after the rescue and is still in a critical condition.

KTLA reports that the rescue took an hour and a half and the man was able to get the attention of rescuers by using a flashlight or cell phone to shine light out the window.

'It was reported that he said he didnâ€™t want to drown. He did state that he did it on purpose, to drive over the side,' Captain Tianaka told CBS Los Angeles.
