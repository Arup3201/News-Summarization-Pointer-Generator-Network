A beauty queen turned lawyer who was jailed for a drunken hit-and-run is being sued by her victim after she 'cruelly' refused to take the blame for his extensive injuries.

Kristina Long, 26, was jailed for 12 months after being found guilty of crashing into museum technician David Robinson, catapulting him 80 feet into the air, while she was driving home drunk from a work Christmas party held at the Reebok Stadium in Bolton.

Mr Robinson's lawyers have now contacted Long, who is held at Styal women’s prison in Cheshire, to demand she help pay for his recovery from fractures to the neck, spine, pelvis and leg, and bleeding on the brain.

Denial: Long, who was a trainee lawyer at the time of the crash, was arrested two hours later but spent up to a year claiming she was not responsible for the hit-and-run

Long, who competed in international 
beauty pageants while at university, was driving at twice the legal 
drink drive limit when she crashed into Mr Robinson at a pedestrian 
crossing in Salford on December 15, 2012.

She
 had just entered a 20mph zone but was traveling at 30mph when a friend 
started vomiting in the back seat of her Vauxhall Corsa due to the 
effects of alcohol.

Distracted, Long collided with Mr Robinson and then, despite
 knowing she had 'hit someone', continued her journey into 
Manchester City Centre, leaving Mr Robinson lying badly injured in the 
road until a passing motorist called an ambulance.

He
 spent a month in Salford Royal Hospital with two fractures to his 
spine, two fractures to his leg which required surgery, a pelvic 
fracture, neck fractures and a bleed to the brain.

Long,
 who was a trainee lawyer at the time of the crash, was arrested two 
hours later and spent up to a year claiming she was not responsible for 
the hit-and-run.

Long was jailed for 12 months and disqualified from driving for two years at Manchester Crown Court after being found guilty of a series of driving offences

But last 
month she was jailed for 12 months after she pleaded guilty to dangerous
 driving causing serious injury, failing to stop at the scene of a 
collision, and driving with excess alcohol.

She was also disqualified from driving for two years, but told the court she had no intention of driving again anyway.

Today
 it emerged that Mr Robinson’s lawyers at Irwin Mitchell are taking 
legal action over the accident and are currently agreeing a figure with 
Long’s insurers to pay for his recovery.

In
 a statement Mr Robinson, who was walking home from his own office 
Christmas party, said: 'I don’t remember anything about the accident but
 I’m obviously lucky to be alive really.'

'I used to love swimming, walking my dog and running before the crash but the past year has just been horrendous'

'My
 injuries meant I was in hospital for a long time and I’m still not able
 to return to my hobbies. I also had to move back in with my parents so 
that they could help me with basic everyday tasks. I’m now working with 
my lawyers to get specialist support to help me recover further.'

'I’m
 relieved justice has been done in the criminal case and hope that by 
speaking out about my injuries it highlights to others how serious drink
 driving can be.'

Long won beauty pageant Miss Bolton and also represented Northern Ireland in a beauty pageant in South Korea before turning her attention to law, where she got a job at UK firm Keogh's

Banned: Long pleaded guilty to a series of driving offences and was jailed for a year, as well as being disqualified from driving for two years. She told the court she had no intention of driving again anyway

Drunk: Long, who competed in international beauty pageants while at university, was driving at twice the legal drink drive limit when she crashed into Mr Robinson at a pedestrian crossing in Salford

'Drivers 
need to take responsibility for their actions and consider the impact 
that their decision to drink drive can have on other people,' Mr Robinson added.

During
 the trial, Manchester Crown Court was told Long had spent four hours drinking wine 
and vodka at a work party held at Bolton’s Reebok Stadium by her law 
firm Keogh’s.

Mr Robinson’s 
lawyer Matt Brown said: 'This was a horrific accident that could have 
been avoided had the defendant driver thought about the possible 
consequences of her actions.

'Drink
 driving is extremely dangerous and this case highlights the impact it 
has on the innocent victims that are left seriously injured.

'Also
 in this case the defendant failed to take responsibility for her 
actions and cruelly pleaded not guilty for a long period of time before 
changing her plea very late in the day.

Long was jailed for 12 months at Manchester Crown Court after she pleaded guilty to dangerous driving causing serious injury, failing to stop at the scene of a collision and driving with excess alcohol

Event: Long was driving home over the limit after a work Christmas party at Bolton's Reebok Stadium (pictured) when she hit Mr Robinson at more than 30mph in a 20mph zone

'This
 dragged the criminal proceedings out far longer than necessary having a
 further impact on David and his family as they were unable to fully 
concentrate on his recovery,' Mr Brown added.

Police found 45mg of alcohol 
on Long's breath almost two hours after the incident - meaning she was 
likely to have be at least 61mg in her body at the time of the crash. The legal limit is 35mg.

Long's car was also severely damaged from the impact with Mr Robinson.

Long,
 from Altrincham in Greater Manchester but originally from Belfast, 
competed in World Miss University in 2010 representing Northern Ireland,
 where she won the 'Miss Speech' award.

After graduating she became a lawyer at Keogh’s.
