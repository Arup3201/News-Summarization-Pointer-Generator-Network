Most of us would turn and run when faced with an erupting volcano.

But one intrepid photographer has trekked right up to a molten lava spewing crater in search of the perfect shot.

Miles Morgan was just one metre away from the source of the eruptions when he took some of these incredible images of Kilauea Volcano in Hawaii.

The 42-year-old - who burned his feet in the process - said: 'On this outing we were able to access the beach, which made for some dramatic photography, but came with a surprise.

These close ups photos of a raging volcano left this intrepid photographer with burned feet after he trekked right up to the crater to get the perfect angle

'I wasn't too concerned as some bigger waves started to crash onto the beach area. But the water rushed in above my knees, it was scalding hot.'

The Kilauea Volcano is one of the most active volcanos in the world and has been erupting constantly for the last 20 years.

But Mr Morgan was determined to get as close as possible for his shots and added: 'At times, it was possible to get right up to the flow itself if the wind was blowing the plume away from us.

The amazing images show the photographer just yards away from the spewing lava

The photographer, from Portland, Oregon, USA, was not injured while taking his images but admits another photographer was lost and is thought to have been killed just a week earlier

He said the closest he got was probably about one metre, which required him to run away each time a wave hit the lava in case there was an explosion

'The most probably cause would be that a portion of the lava bench that builds out over the sea collapsed while he was on it,' suggested Miles.

The photographer, who also works as an airline pilot, said his wife supported his adventures, but admits he usually hides his expeditions from other family until afterwards

He explained the tactics behind his unusual hobby: 'The most important challenge, was not allowing yourself to become so hypnotised by the lava that you lose sight of the very real and ever-present dangers that surround you'

He added: 'Things change every second, so timing the shots and the waves is a constant battle.
