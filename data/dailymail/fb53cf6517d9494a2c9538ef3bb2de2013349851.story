Basket case Caterham will go to the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix after raising enough funds through their ‘crowdfunding’ scheme.

The news will not be met with unalloyed joy by F1 boss Bernie Ecclestone, who said in one of his more maverick interviews that the sport could live without smaller teams, whose plight he likened to ‘poor’ Oscar Pistorius.

‘They are not front-running teams,’ he told Campaign Asia-Pacific magazine. ‘They’ve only got a name because of the problems they’re in.

F1 supremo Bernie Ecclestone has likened smaller team's troubles to jailed athlete Oscar Pistorius

‘This poor guy in South Africa, for instance, has got more interest because of what happened with him than when he was winning gold medals.’

Pistorius is serving a jail term for shooting dead his girlfriend.

Meanwhile Caterham, who have seemingly raised £2million thanks to fan donations and sponsorship, will be run in Abu Dhabi by administrator Finbarr O’Connell, who knows next to nothing about F1.
