She appeared in some of the Victorian period's most famous paintings and married one of Britain's greatest artists before dying of a laudanum overdose at the age of 32.

Now the fascinating life of Lizzie Siddal, dubbed the Pre-Raphaelite supermodel, is to be brought to the stage for the first time.

The play, named Lizzie Siddal, tells the story of the flame-haired beauty from the day she was plucked from the obscurity of a Victorian bonnet shop to her tragic death.

Premiering at the Arcola Theatre on the 20th November, the play stars Emma West as the tragic model and Tom Bateman, currently appearing on Sky Atlantic's The Tunnel, as her husband Dante Gabriel Rossetti.

Rossetti was one of the most famous of the Pre-Raphaelites and is cited as an inspiration for William Morris and Edward Burne-Jones among others.

Among his works are The Roman Widow and Beata Beatrix, both of which starred Siddal, and Lady Lillith which depicts another of his harem of flame-haired muses and lovers, Fanny Cornforth.

But it was Siddal who would prove his greatest love and the painter was left heartbroken by her death in 1862.

'The more you read about her the more fascinating she becomes,' playwright Jeremy Green revealed in an interview with the BBC.

'Here's a woman who, with no advantages, became famous as a model; but that wasn't sufficient, she wanted to produce art and, falling in love, she wanted to be fulfilled in her love - and in pursuit of both she met tragic consequences.

'It's a play about love and death and immortality.'

Siddal's career began when she was spotted working in a London milliners shop by early Pre-Raphaelite artist, Walter Deverell.

Through Deverell, Siddal, described as 'a most beautiful creature with an air between dignity and sweetness' by her future brother-in-law William Michael Rossetti, met the remaining Pre-Raphaelite artists, including Rossetti himself.

Of all the paintings inspired by Siddal though, the most famous is Sir John Everett-Millais' 1852 work Ophelia, which shows the model as Shakespeare's doomed Danish princess floating in a river before her death from drowning.

To produce the painting, Siddal was required to lie in an icy-cold bath for hours on end, a requirement that led to a bout of pneumonia.

Resemblance: Emma West plays Siddal in the new play and experienced being submerged in a bath

'I had the experience of lying in the bath,' West told the BBC. 'The longest I did was five or six hours,.

'That's a helpful thing to have done, despite the fact that my fingers were prune-like. The crew were scooping cold water out and pouring in hot water so I was fine.'

She adds: 'It's tempting to think, "How cruel of Millais", but actually there was nothing to stop Lizzie saying, 'It's getting a bit cold now'. But she didn't. She chose to try and be the perfect model for him.'

Although Ophelia is the most famous of the paintings featuring Siddal, by 1851, she was also sitting for Rossetti, whose paintings of her are thought to number in the thousands, and who continued to paint her even after her death.

Siddal never entirely recovered from the ill-health caused by sitting for Ophelia, and despite years spent recuperating in Nice, remained frail.

Later, she succumbed to depression, caused in part, by Rossetti's numerous affairs, and also developed an addiction to laudanum.

When, in 1861, she suffered a stillbirth, the end was in sight. On the 11th February 1862, Rossetti came home to find her dying in her bed.

Siddal, the first supermodel, had taken an overdose of the drug, although whether it was deliberate or not remains a mystery. She was just 32 years old.
