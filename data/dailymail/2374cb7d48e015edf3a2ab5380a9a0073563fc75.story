Manchester United target Diego Godin is going nowhere, according to his current Atletico Madrid boss Diego Simeone.  

The centre back has been linked with a £15.7million move to United in January - with the Old Trafford outfit's defensive problems under manager Louis van Gaal well-documented.

The Uruguay international is one of several players the Red Devils are considering at the back, with the £28m release buy-out clause not a stumbling block for executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward.

Godin has been an ever-present in Simeone's side this season in La Liga, with the reigning champions currently third - four points behind arch-rivals Real. 

And Simeone is adamant that if United are interested in the 28-year-old they need will quickly be disappointed.

'Let's talk about something else,' Simeone replied when asked about United's potential bid. 'How much? Twenty (million euros)? For Godin?

'It must be a mistake.'

Atletico's next match is away to Elche on Saturday, with Godin likely to start at the heart of their defence as they seek a third-successive league win.
