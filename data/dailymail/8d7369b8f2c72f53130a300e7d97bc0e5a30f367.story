Chopped: Mary Berry's shark recipe will be removed from her new cook book

She is the queen of baking who can usually do no wrong in the eyes of her fans.

But when Mary Berry published a controversial recipe using shark fillets, her loyal followers were horrified.

Dozens took to the internet demanding to know why she was encouraging people to eat a species whose numbers are dwindling in the wild because they are being slaughtered illegally for their meat.

Now, in the face of mounting pressure, the much-loved TV cook is to remove the offending recipe – Shark With Tropical Salsa – from her Complete Cookbook.

Graham Buckingham, of shark and marine conservation charity Bite-Back, said: ‘No modern cookbook should include recipes for shark and other threatened species.

‘The last thing the marine environment needs is more people asking fishmongers for shark and swordfish because Mary Berry thinks it’s OK.’

Those who expressed their anger on the internet included ‘Scorch’, who wrote: ‘Please, please, please do not buy this book. Mary Berry apparently has no regard whatsoever for our oceans, and actually has included a recipe for Shark With Tropical Salsa.

‘Either the lovely Ms. Berry has been too busy to notice all the press surrounding the increasingly dwindling shark population, or she doesn’t care. Either way, please do not encourage this sort of awful consumerism by adding to her profit margin.’ 

NC wrote: ‘Unbelievably, this cookbook contains recipes that call for the use of shark and swordfish. It is quite frankly disgusting that in this day and age, when shark populations and the marine environment as a whole are subjected to increasing threats, a cookbook is promoting this. Despicable.’

The Complete Cookbook is published internationally by Dorling Kindersley. It was first published in 1995 and the most recent edition, published last year, includes the shark recipe.

It will be removed from future editions. In a statement issued through her publishers Mary Berry, who does not specify what kind of shark to use in her recipe, said: ‘As this book is not just sold in the UK, my publishers at DK and I try to include the occasional recipe for fish that is more widely available abroad.

‘My intention for any of my recipes is always to use responsibly sourced ingredients, but in retrospect we realise this wasn’t clear in the recipe. We understand that some species of shark are endangered and we have taken on board concerns.

'I have therefore spoken with my publishers and we have both agreed that this recipe will be removed from future printings of the book.’

Of the more than 400 species of shark, at least 60 are classified as endangered and many have protected status.

Bite-Back has led a campaign backed by Gordon Ramsay, Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall and Bear Grylls to condemn chefs who cook with shark.

It says a boom in demand for shark fin soup has increased the number of sharks being killed by sea fishermen.

More than 90 per cent of the population has been lost in some species over the past 20 to 30 years, according to experts.
