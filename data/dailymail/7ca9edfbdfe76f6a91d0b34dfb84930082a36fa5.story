Connecticut police decided against sending a hostage negotiator to the home of the Petit family on the morning they were brutally murdered, it has emerged.

Jennifer Hawke-Petit was raped and strangled to death and her daughters, Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11, were tied to their beds and died when the house in Cheshire was set alight on July 23, 2007.

The girls' father, Dr. William Petit was beaten and tied up but escaped the flames, living to see Joshua Komisarjevsky and Stephen Hayes be sentenced to death in 2011 for the murders.

On the sixth anniversary of the 
horrific killings, the Hartford Courant has obtained police calls 
through law enforcement sources showing that officers with the Cheshire 
Police Department doubted the danger underway at the household.

Torn apart: William Petit, right, was the only member of the family to escape alive. Jennifer Hawke-Petit was strangled and their daughters Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11, were killed in the flames

They were also outside the home when the murders were carried out and before the home was burned to the ground, it has emerged.

Police were first alerted to trouble at the house when Hawke-Petit was taken to a Bank of America and forced to withdraw $15,000, where she told the teller she was being held hostage.

When a police officer went to the bank 23 
minutes after the initial 911 call, he told a dispatcher in a recorded 
phone call that he doubted the accuracy of Hawke-Petit's story.

'She came into the bank, she tried to get some money out,' Lt James Fasano told the dispatcher. 'One of the accounts was in her husband's name, and then she says, "Well, my kids are at home tied up". So we don't know if they really are or if she was just trying to get money out at this point.'

He added that she had entered the bank alone and appeared calm, and that her captor had said nothing would happen to her as long as she handed over the money.

The phone calls also include one in which a hostage negotiator, Eric Granoth, is told he was not 
needed at the scene.

Killers: Joshua Komisarjevsky, left, and Stephen Hayes, right, have been sentenced to death for the murders

Crime scene: The killers broke into this home in Cheshire and held the family hostage - but the police told a hostage negotiator not to report to the home. Authorities have not explained why

'I need to know whether you want me in or
not,' he said in a 15-second conversation with dispatcher Donald Miller. 'I am the hostage negotiator and I got paged.'

Miller then asked Deputy Chief 
Joseph Popovich if he wanted the negotiator, and Miller can be heard telling Granoth 'not at this time' before hanging up.

New Haven Public Defender Thomas Ullmann, who represented Hayes, said: 'The fact that a 
hostage negotiator, listening to what was going on during the dispatch 
communications, felt compelled to call central police headquarters 
offering his assistance and then being turned away is shocking.'

Miller then received a call from SWAT team member Kerry Nastri, who asks whether they should start suiting up and head to the scene - but Miller said officers said they would call on them if they were needed.

Ten minutes later, Nastri called back to say they were going there anyway.

Also shocking is how the police have never performed a review of the incident.

Looking forward: Five years after losing his family, Dr Petit married Christine Paluf last year

Town Manager Michael Milone would not provide a reason for this, nor one for why the hostage negotiator was told not to go to the home.

Cindy Renn, Jennifer Hawke-Petit's 
sister, told the Courant that authorities have never carried out a 
review of the incident or their actions.

'Nobody
in that department ever looked at what they did or didn't do right or 
wrong,' Renn said. 'Admit when you make mistakes and do better the next 
time and save people's lives.'

An HBO documentary that aired on Monday included a timeline that placed police at the house before Hawke-Petit was raped or the house was set on fire.
