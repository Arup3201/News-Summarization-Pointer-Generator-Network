Revolt to oust him: Richard Burnell stepped aside as Father Christmas after residents complained that he could not speak Welsh

With his authentic bushy beard and red suit, Richard Burnell appeared the obvious choice to inhabit the Christmas grotto at his local museum.

But that wasn’t enough for parents on the Isle of Anglesey.

Because when they learned that Father Christmas could not speak Welsh they mounted a revolt to oust him.

Yesterday the 72-year-old retired housing officer admitted he had stepped aside after complaints that he wouldn’t be able to listen to children’s wish lists in their native tongue.

Mr Burnell, who belongs to an American organisation called the Amalgamated Order of Real Bearded Santas, was due to don his red suit for the opening of the Christmas grotto at Oriel Ynys Mon, the island’s history and culture museum, in Langefni, on December 9.

But when parents realised he wasn’t bilingual they lodged complaints with the local council.

‘I think it is a disgrace that you have an English-only Father Christmas coming to Oriel Ynys Mon,’ one mother said.

‘It’s going to cost £2.50 a child to meet him, so I’d expect they could find one who can speak Welsh.

‘I have young children who are still not that confident when speaking English, I think it is a shame they won’t be able to chat to Father Christmas in their own language.

‘The Oriel should be supporting the Welsh language.’ 

Pat West, principal archives, museums and cultural officer, defended the decision to hire Mr Burnell, but said he had decided to step aside after learning of opposition to his appointment.

‘There are lots of Santas around but this one is one of a few who has a real beard and I felt we were very lucky to be able to bring him here,’ she added. ‘I was going to be one of his helpers.

‘It is very disappointing, I never thought the Welsh language would be a question on this.’ 

When contacted by the Daily Mail yesterday, Mr Burnell, who has been playing Father Christmas for 12 years, insisted there were no hard feelings.

‘I was asked if I could speak Welsh and I had to admit that I’m not able to hold a conversation,’ he added.

‘I was born in Birkenhead and my father was Welsh. I’ve lived here since 1949 and have tried to learn Welsh. I can get by, but not in a long conversation.

‘I’ve no real need for it as no-one in my home speaks it.’ 

Mr
Burnell, who has 27 engagements at schools and civic events, across 
north Wales this year, added: ‘I have no hard feelings about it.

‘If
they want a bilingual Father Christmas that’s quite all right with me, I
am happy to stand aside. I don’t do this for the politics or the 
nationalism, but for the children.

No hard feelings: Mr Burnell said he cannot hold a conversation in Welsh and so was happy to stand aside. He said: 'I don’t do this for the politics or the nationalism, but for the children'

‘I enjoy being Father Christmas and on Christmas morning I’ll be doing my rounds at the Stanley Hospital here.

‘No one has mentioned the Welsh language before, but it is no problem so far as I’m concerned. My outfit has cost nearly £400 pounds but the children love it.’

A spokesman for Anglesey County Council said: ‘We can confirm that Santa Claus/Sion Corn will be bilingual and he looks forward to celebrating the magic of Christmas with children visiting Oriel Ynys Mon next month.’

The row comes just weeks after parents launched a protest group opposing the use of Welsh in primary schools in Mid-wales.

At one school, it was claimed, children as young as four were being refused permission to go to the toilet unless they asked in Welsh and at another parents were dissuaded from reading bedtime stories to youngsters in English in case it hindering the development of their native tongue.
