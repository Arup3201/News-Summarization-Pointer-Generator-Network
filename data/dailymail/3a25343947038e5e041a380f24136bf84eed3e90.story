A young woman who was stabbed more than 30 times by by her ex-boyfriend had to undergo several emergency surgeries and flat lined four times while receiving more than 12 pints of blood.

Melissa Dohme, who is only 5ft tall, was allegedly stabbed by 6ft4in Robert Burton as they walked outside a park hear Ms Dohme’s home in Clearwater, Florida this January.

Burton had been calling and texting her requesting a hug - however, when she met him to talk, she said she heard a click, and then sharp pain in her neck, where he allegedly embedded his knife.

He is facing charges of attempted first-degree murder and assault from a previous altercation.

Robert Burton is charged with attempted first-degree murder after he allegedly stabbed Ms Dohme

However, the 20-year-old remains optimistic, and recently left for a backpacking trip through Europe, which she planned before the January 24 attack.

Ms Dohme met Burton at Clearwater High School, and the couple dated for nearly two years.

However, things took a violent turn when Burton allegedly attacked her outside Ms Dohme’s house last October. Court documents allege that he pulled her hair and punched her repeatedly.

The couple broke up soon after. But Burton called and texted the petit blonde over and over January 24, saying he needed to see her, according to the Tampa Bay Times.

Ms Dohme told the Times that she initially ignored him and told Burton that she had class early the next day – it was, after all, around 2:30am.

She agreed to see him when he said he was near her house, around 3am.

He said he only needed a hug. Even so, Ms Dohme took pepper spray with her.

According to court documents, Burton asked for a hug, and then began stabbing her in the face and neck.

During the attack, she was screaming as loud as she could, hoping someone would hear. A young couple who did not want to be publically identified happened to be in Crest Lake Park.

Law and order: Ms Dohme wrote: 'Ran into these two great men tonight, detectives Ruhlin and Sena! These are the ones working on my case and were able to get the jerk (putting it nicely) to confess his guilt'

According to a police report, the couple – who are both in their late teens – yelled at Burton to stop and said he was going to kill her.

The man attempted to push the 245-pound Burton off of Ms Dohme, but was unable to. Meanwhile, the young woman tried to help Ms Dohme escape to safety and called 911.

Ms Dohme told the Tampa Bay Times that the couple’s intervention likely saved her live. ‘(Burton) would have stabbed me ‘til I was dead,’ she told the Times.

'I know it's a miracle that I am still here. Even the trauma doctor in his notes wrote, nothing short of miraculous.'

The couple left, and Burton had allegedly gone back to his truck to retrieve a bigger knife. Ms Dohme had lost pints of blood already, and was fading.

Burton was later found after he crashed his car some distance away. He was believed to have overdosed on sleeping pills.

Doctors rushed her to Bayfront, where she underwent several surgeries, and was given 12 units of blood.

She suffered a slash to the right side of her face that severed a nerve. The knife also grazed her carotid artery, which meant she was in serious danger of bleeding out.

Ms Dohme later counted 32 stab wounds, 18 of which were deep.

‘I know it’s a miracle that I am still here,’ she told Bay News 9 in an interview earlier this month. ‘Even the trauma doctor in his notes wrote, nothing short of miraculous.’

But her fighting spirit, as well as her faith helped her persevere. ‘He didn’t win and I won,’ she told the Times.

Within days of the near-lethal attack, Ms Dohme was able to breathe on her own, could grasp a pencil, and could walk down the hallways of the ICU.

Achievements: She was named 2012 Student of the Year Award at St Petersburg College and managed to finish her courses, receiving A's

She had to regularly attend speech therapy and get check-ups with other specialists.

Remarkably, she went home three weeks later, and finished out her classes at St Petersburg College, earning A’s in her Humanities and Sociology classes.

Burton faces assault charges in addition to first-degree attempted murder charges.

Ms Dohme hasn’t let the injury slow her down. Though she completes seven hours of rehab weekly, she continues to be the bright, smiling young woman she was before the attack.

She is currently backpacking through Europe with a few girlfriends, and has received an outpouring of support from friends and family.

Her brush with death hasn’t stopped her from pursuing her dream – becoming a neo-natal nurse. And more than anything, nearly losing everything has shown her a new appreciation for the small tings.

‘I’ve never loved life so much, I’ve never been so appreciative, I really appreciate every day,’ she told Bay News 9.

However, there are some more battles to be won.

Her medical bills alone total more than half a million dollars, and she faces more surgeries in the future – especially cosmetic procedures that will help lessen the appearance of scars on her face and neck.

The aspiring nurse is currently petitioning Governor Rick Scott and Senator Mark Rubio (R-Florida), as well as President Obama, for Melissa’s Law.

The law states that those with restraining orders against them should pay for monitoring. In addition, victims should receive texts, emails, and phone calls to be alerted when their attackers and stalkers are near.

It also calls for the names of judges, and defence attorneys who allow perpetrators to be released to be published.
