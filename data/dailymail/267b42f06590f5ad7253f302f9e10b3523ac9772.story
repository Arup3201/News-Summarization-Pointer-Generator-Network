'Liar': Randy Garrison, 31, was arraigned on two charges of child abandonment after police say the Missouri man lied about trying to pull his toddler sons from a burning mobile home in December

A Missouri father who gave police a detailed account of how he heroically tried to save his two sons from a mobile home fire in December has been charged with abandoning them to die in the flames.

Randy Garrison, 31, of Orrick, was arraigned Friday in Ray County on two charges of child abandonment in the deaths of 20-month-old Ashton Garrison and 3-year-old Roger Garrison.

Prosecutors say Garrison lied when he told authorities he fought his way through flames and smoke to try to reach the boys in the midday blaze, tripped over a bungee cord and fell face-down into the fire.

He also claimed to have ripped siding off the outside of the trailer and punched a hole through to try to reach his sons before being overcome by smoke.

Investigators said in court documents that Garrison changed his story over several days of questioning.

When pressed by investigators, the 31-year-old man allegedly admitted that he thought the fire was bigger than it actually was. 

'Maybe I panicked, maybe I didn’t think, I don’t know,' Garrison allegedly said, according to Kansas City Star.

Medical personnel said he did not have burns or carbon monoxide levels consistent with someone who had been involved in a fire the way he described, and his white T-shirt her no soot stains.

Ravaged: The Garrisons' mobile home in Orrick, Missouri, burned to the ground December 10, killing two young children

A firefighter said there was no damage to the outside of the trailer consistent with someone trying to force entry.

Garrison
 allegedly told an officer that a woman who also lived in the trailer 
had threatened to kill him and his sons, and that he later said he 
thought she had abducted his sons and they were not dead, according to 
court documents.

Garrison was being held Friday morning on $100,000 cash-only bond.

The cause of the deadly fire has not been determined. 

In the days after the tragedy, Randy Garrison told Fox 4 how he awoke just after 11am December 10 to hear his sons screaming and the boys mother, Tammy Willis, was not home.

Garrison arrived home from work that day at 6am after working a 24-hour shift and went directly to bed. He saw the boy's mother asleep with them on the couch.

'I woke up hearing them screaming at the top of their lungs,' he told the station. 'Flames in my bedroom and flames in the hallway, flames through the whole house.'

The home that burned down was entirely decimated and the cause of the fire in still unknown

The father described in great detail 
how he tried to burst through his bedroom hall, and when he couldn't, he
 ran into the hallway and tripped. Something may have been holding the 
door to his children's bedroom shut.

'I
 fell over a bungee cord or something that was holding their bedroom 
door shut,' he said at the time. 'I ran out the back door around to the 
front, started ripping the sheeting off the house and trying to punch 
through that way and I couldn’t.'

Garrison claims he didn't know that the boy's mother was leaving. The couple were not married but lived together for the sake of the children.

'The mother was in the house whenever I went to sleep this morning,' he said. 'And I woke up to her not being here, but my kids were here. You’d think a parent would either wake up another adult in the house or take the kids with her.'

Panic: Randy Garrison conceded that he may have overestimated the magnitude of the fire and ran out

Garrison told reporters in December that his children were very important to him.

'They were my rock, everything I had in life,' Garrison said. 'The only reason I woke up everyday was for my boys.'

'What would go through your mind after hearing your kids scream bloody murder and basically watching them die in front of you?' he asked KCTV5.

Coincidentally, Garrison named one of
 his sons Roger after his brother who died in a fire a few years ago.
