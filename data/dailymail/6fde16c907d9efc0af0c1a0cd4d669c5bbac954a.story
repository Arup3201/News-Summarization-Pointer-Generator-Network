A former prisoner has justified her £20,000 sex change by claiming the NHS wastes money on cancer sufferers.

Jasmine Goode, 37, formerly known as Darren, was born in Rhyl, North Wales, with both male and female genitals and was raised as a girl called Sarah-Jane until she was eight.

Then she said she was encouraged by her parents to live as a boy called Darren and says she felt pressured to be 'macho' by her father.

Former burglar Jasmine Goode, previously known as Darren, has had a £20,000 sex change on the NHS

As a result of this gender confusion, she claims she started hanging around with a bad element and took her first steps into a life of crime to try and appear more macho. In 1994, aged 18, she was jailed for burglary for the first time.

She spent the next few years in and out of prison until May 2006 when, while serving an 11-year stretch for a string of burglaries, she told a prison nurse she was transex and wanted to live a new life as a woman.

Since then the NHS has spent £20,000 on sex change operations and treatments for Jasmine.

She said: 'The NHS wastes money helping people with cancer, often smokers, even though their condition is terminal and they are going to die whereas I've got years left.'

Jasmine told The Sun her condition was as 'life-threatening as cancer' because of high suicide rates among the transgender community, adding that giving him the treatment was cost-effective as she would otherwise be too depressed to work and instead claim benefits.

Jasmine, who works for a charity that helped her with the sex change, has a 16-year-old son from one relationship and two children from a marriage to a different woman, who are now nine and 10.

When she - then a he - was alone with his eldest son, she would pretend to be the child's mother and wore her girlfriend's clothes. She no longer sees her children.

After the breakdown of the marriage and she was moved to an open prison, Jasmine applied to the NHS for cash for gender reassignment.

Hormone tablets made her grow breasts, a charity donated women's clothes and make up and £18,000 from the NHS paid for electrolysis and laser treatment to remove body hair, followed by surgery to transform her genitals.

Although the NHS refused to pay for breast enhancement, she has since had surgery to gain a 36E chest - claiming her sex life has 'gone wild' since the op.

She said: 'People might be angry, but I had a condition that needed treating.

'I feel awful about my criminal past and I'm so sorry to those I hurt during that time. I'd never step on the wrong side of the law again - I'm living the dream.'

An NHS England spokesperson said: 'It is up to the NHS locally to decide what treatments to provide and all decisions made about gender identity services are based on an individual clinical assessment.

'Prisoners have the right to receive the same range and quality of NHS treatments and services as anyone else, including gender identity services.'
