One in ten had Botox at home or a friend's home

More than five in six people who have had Botox admit to having no idea what exactly was injected into their face.

And new figures reveal that more people than ever are seeking help after botched procedures.

A shocking 84 per cent of youth-seekers 
admitted to having absolutely no idea what was going into their
 faces when under-going the procedure - or even if the injection 
given actually contained key ingredient Botulinum toxin.

The national research carried out by a leading cosmetic surgery company has found that almost a third (29 per cent) of respondents said they had their treatment done at a local beauty salon, one in ten had one at home or a friend's home, and 3 per cent were treated at a 'beauty treatment party'.

Many said they had no idea if the person administering the injection was appropriately trained to perform the procedure.

Almost two-thirds (62 per cent) of the 1,500 respondents who have had or considered having non-surgical treatments thought the industry is not regulated properly , or that enough is 
being done to protect people receiving treatment.

A third 
confessed to feeling nervous or frightened before, during and after the procedure
 they underwent.

The average age of Botox patients is 35-44, and 70 per cent opt for the procedure to look ‘a little fresher'.

The non-surgical treatments industry, which encompasses treatments such as Botox and dermal fillers, is currently worth more than £1.7 billion.

Transform Cosmetic Surgery have seen an alarming 15 per cent rise in the number of patients seeking help
 following ineffective treatments with non-registered 'faux-tox' salons. Worryingly, they say patients come to them after being treated in a non-clinical environment, despite being given a prescription-only medicine.

The company is concerned about the 
increase in patients undergoing treatment in less than sterile 
environments, delivered by unqualified practitioners.

A spokesperson for non-surgical treatments at Transform stresses the importance of knowing what's going into your face.

They said: 'There are subtle differences in the chemical formulations of the main brands of Botulinum toxin available in the UK.

'This
 has many implications. For example storage. 'Botox' should always be 
refrigerated - and if it's not, you should quiz your practitioner.

'Similarly,
 there are usually differences in pricing and the efficacy of each i.e. 
the effects of one may last longer than another.'

Botulinum toxin is available under four product formulations: Botox, Vistabel, Azzalure, and Bocouture.

While all four are generated from same bacteria, the Botox brand has most Botulinum toxin in it and lasts longest.

Botox comes with a red or purple top, while for example Azzalure and Bocouture have blue tops. You can also tell them apart as Botox has a hologram and is kept in a fridge.

Another spokesperson added: 'It's alarming to see the number of Brits being 
treated by unqualified practitioners and in less than sterile 
environments.

'As
 part of our CLEAR Patient Charter and in support of current reviews 
into the regulation of cosmetic surgery, Transform is keen to raise 
awareness of misconceptions around line and wrinkle treatments. We have long suspected a lack of understanding and knowledge; 
perhaps exacerbated by less than forthcoming information from some 
practitioners.

'We
 hope that in highlighting this, consumers who wish to undergo 
non-surgical treatment for lines and wrinkles will ask better questions 
of their practitioner, and themselves if they are seeing a great 'deal',
 or a lower than usual price. At Transform, treatments are always 
conducted in a clinical environment, and more importantly by fully 
trained clinical staff.'

Dr Hilary 
Jones, an independent member of Transform's Clear Panel said: 'Informed 
consent is vital for any medical procedure and cosmetic interventions 
such as anti-wrinkle injections are no exception.

'It is essential that 
each patient understands exactly which product is being injected into 
their body and whether the brand of Botulinum toxin used meets stringent
 standards of quality efficacy and above all safety, and has an enduring
 and proven track record. If someone is offered Botox specifically for 
example, that is exactly what they should be given and nothing else.

'We
 want patients to be in a better position to make an informed decision 
about their chosen practitioner and the wrinkle treatment being 
administered. 

'Botox
 is one of four licensed toxin products used for the treatment of lines 
and wrinkles. However, there are nuances between each and patients 
should be looking to their practitioner to explain what product is being
 used and why.

According to consultant plastic surgeon and member of the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons, Mr Nilesh Sojitra:

'Botox, Vistabel are the same product where former is 100units and latter 50units per vial.

Azzalure formerly know as dysport is a cheaper alternative as is Bocouture. The cost of the the alternative products is cheaper and not always passed on to the patient.

In my personal experience, I prefer Botox and Vistabel as the molecules are larger and therefore I feel more accurate to position in areas especially near they eye.

'Smaller molecules from other products may diffuse and move to areas where you don't want the product.

'Patients who have had the alternatives feel the effects may not last as long as Botox/Vistabel.'
