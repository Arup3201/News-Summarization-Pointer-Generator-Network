About 250 Ford Australia workers will lose their jobs at the car manufacturer's Broadmeadows and Geelong factories, it has been revealed.

The Australian Manufacturing Workers Union have confirmed to Daily Mail Australia these redundancies were a long time coming, with Ford flagging jobs were at risk earlier this year as car sales decline.

It comes just over a year after Ford announced the two factories would close its doors in 2016.

Ford Australia is set to axe about 250 jobs from its two Victorian factories that employs more than 1000 people by June 20

The Victorian factories employ more than 1000 workers and about 250 of them will be gone by June 20.

The job losses come after Holden and Toyota announced in December and February respectively they would both cease Australian operations by 2017.

It follows six years of struggle for the auto industry since Mitsubishi closed its Adelaide plant in 2008.

Regional secretary of the AMWU vehicle division Paul Difelice said they had been in talks with Ford since March.

'They have been pretty transparent. Obviously it’s a sad day,' he told MailOnline on Thursday.

'The employees they have are highly skilled and dedicated employees.

'I’ve had a couple of discussions with Ford management and they’re upset too, but it’s a fact of life and there’s nothing we can do about it.'

Mr Difelice said the car manufacturer cited declines in sales of its Ford Territory and Falcon ranges as the reason for the job losses.

'The Falcon is the one that has taken the most hits on the marketplace,' he said.

'There would have been around roughly 1,000 Ford Falcons sold this time last year and now it would be around the 690 figure.'

Ford announced last year it close its doors at Geelong and Broadmeadows on Australian shores by 2016

Mr Difelice said Ford had helped employees look for other jobs by holding career fairs to help those who were made redundant.

'Some have taken the opportunity to pick up a job with a new employer,' he said.

'If there are opportunities rising out of the jobs fair that will suit individual then they will take it instead of Ford having to tap (people on the shoulder) and forcibly make them redundant.'

So far about 50 people have put their hand up for a redundancy package as the June 20 deadline looms.

Declines in sales of the Territory and Falcon are to blame for the forced redundancies

The Productivity Commission, who were tasked with looking into the auto industry, tabled its preliminary findings report and found car manufacturers in Australia were not meeting the annual production of 200,000 to 300,000 vehicles to make them financially viable.

The 2013 report said Australia's new car market was 'small by global standards'.

'It is highly competitive, to the benefit of Australian consumers, but is fragmented,' the report said.

'Top selling models enjoy sales of only a little over 40,000 vehicles a year.'

The commission also said jobs in the industry decreased by 40 per cent between 2006 and 2013, with only 44,000 employed in 2013.
