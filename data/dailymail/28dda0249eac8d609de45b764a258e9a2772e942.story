The U.S. Air Force is considered one of the most feared military bodies in the world. 

But one pilot training unit has adopted an unusually child-like symbol – My Little Pony.

Pilots at Oklahoma's Vance Air Force Base have worn a pony inspired patch since April.

A class at Vance Air Force base have chosen an unusual patch inspired by My Little Pony

Every class at the flying school chooses a patch, normally using symbols representing courage, such as cougars, scorpions or even skulls.

The patch was designed as a joke but has been adopted by the class

But, unusually, Class 14-05 decided to go for something a little more pink, reported The Daily Dot.

First Lieutenant Tom Barger told News on 6: ‘During a slideshow presentation, while previewing the different patch options, the student presenter threw the “My Little Pilot” patch design into the mix as an ironic joke.

‘That patch made it all the way through the approval process and is even more ironic since the class never really wanted it in the first place.’

The patch is inspired by My Little Pony cartoon Friendship is Magic.

It says in pink stylised writing: ‘My Little Pilot, Flying is magic’.

It is thought to be a reference the growing ‘Brony’ community online, a group of grown men who enjoy watching the children’s cartoon.

Patches at Vance are unofficial and are worn only during pilot training.

He added to Escapist magazine: ‘[The class] thought it was so off-the-wall that it was hilarious.

‘They have embraced the irony and humour of the patch and in so doing have fostered closer ties with each other.’

The usually tough persona of the US Air Force has been changed as the class embraced the comedy patch
