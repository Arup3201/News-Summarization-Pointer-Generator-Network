It has brought in 250 million animation lovers and is Europe's busiest tourist attraction but as Disneyland Paris celebrates its 20th birthday today its crippling debts mean it is not an entirely happy one.

Despite charging its 15.7 million annual visitors an average of £51 to get in and meet Mickey Mouse and friends it has been revealed the park near Paris owes a staggering 1.9 billion euros.

And the financial outlook is no fairytale with its bosses saying it will take at least 12 years to pay off the mountain of debt.

Its popularity overshadows the 8.4 million visitors who go to see the Mona Lisa at the Louvre annually and the 6.6 million who climb to Paris' iconic Eiffel Tower.

But Disney's risky decision to build its 
European park in an area often hit by cold and wet winters may not have 
paid off as it posted an overall loss of 55.6 million euros last year.

And the financial austerity measures sweeping across Europe has also hit Disneyland Paris, as for the first time it will have no ride set up to celebrate its birthday.

Despite the bleak financial picture visitors say they still love the park, with millions visiting from Britain every year, however, the park is not turning this into profit.

'We're students so we work very hard most of the time so it's really nice to come away and do something really childish but really fun,' Britons Jojo and Jake told AFP.

'It's magic, we're in France, but it feels like we're in another country altogether,' Belgian tourist Christelle added.

Disney had said when it launched the park in 1992 that they feared 'it would be too successful' and when it opened cars queued in traffic for hours to get in.

But a series of changes and financial problems followed.

Bosses were forced to change the name from Euro Disney to Disneyland Paris because people linked 'Euro' with business and finance not the glamour Americans associate with Europe.

They were also forced to overturn an alcohol ban because of the French love of wine and had a huge bank bailout in the 90s amid rumours that they were going bankrupt.

It has also been unpopular with some french visitors and staff, being hit with protests, strikes and was even branded a 'Cultural Chernobyl' by experts 20 years ago.

In nearby Bailly Romainvilliers, where the population leapt from 600 in 1990 to 6,000 after the park was built, its Mayor Arnaud de Belenet said many jobs pay 'barely above minimum wage, which is not at all what local people are looking for.'

Austerity: No new attractions like the park's famous Captain Hook's Pirate Ship Adventureland have been built for the birthday

Success: The park opened with a bang in 1992 but it has been unpopular with the French and struggled because of the cold and wet Parisian winters

But despite the gloom its birthday will be well celebrated as there will be a 'Disney Dreams' gala to mark the 20-year milestone, with a laser show, water and fireworks.

Scores of celebrities have also been brought in to mark the birthday.

Jonathan Ross and family, actress Salma Hayek, singer Katie Melua and even legendary footballer Zinedine Zidane embraced their inner child this month to celebrate the 20th anniversary of Disneyland Paris.

Ross, his screenwriter wife Jane Goldman, and their three children cuddled up to Mickey and Minnie for a celebratory photoshoot and spent the weekend sampling the park's best rides as thousands of visitors from around the world descended for the start of the Easter holidays.

And it is rumoured owners are even mulling over the idea of a new park, ready for 2030.
