Perth has been given the unwanted title of Australia's accidental overdose capital while Adelaide comes in at a close second with the rise in the misuse of painkillers labelled as the reason for the increase.

Brisbane was next on the dreaded list followed by Sydney and then Melbourne while figures were not provided for Tasmania, Canberra and the Northern Territory. 

The Western Australian capital city rate of 5.6 overdose deaths per 100,000 rose above the national average of four deaths per 100,000, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics mortality data.

The number of these accidental overdoses had more than doubled in Perth in 2012 with 106 deaths compared to only 49 deaths a decade earlier. 

A rise in misuse of prescription painkillers, now dubbed as 'harmaceuticals', including powerful opioids - oxycodone and fentanyl - has been linked with the alarming increase in deaths.

Former junkie Patrick McKenzie, who turned to prescribed medication when he couldn't get this hands on heroin, was not surprised by the data saying the access to such drugs had 'boomed' in recent years. 

The data from a decade up until 2012 shows that Perth has the most accidental overdoses than anywhere else in the country

Mr McKenzie said the two most common types of users were those with genuine pain who misused prescription medication and those who weren't in pain but illegally obtain legal pharmaceuticals.

The latter was the path that Mr McKenzie went down.

'I got them on the black market - just off the street - it was really easy,' he said. 'It's demand driven - people will resort to whatever mechanisms they can to get them.'

But he said prescriptions were also easy to obtain through the legal avenues of a doctor's clinic.

'There seems to have been a change in the way doctors prescribe because they are much more available now,' he said.

Meanwhile, accidental drug overdoses are happening more outside of Australia's capital cities for the first time as more remote areas have less access to adequate treatment and services.

Experts say a reason for the shift was a lack of choice when 'doctor shopping' in the areas away from the Big Smoke which has seen more people relying on prescribed drugs and even accessing medication through the black market. 

After living in Sydney for 25 years, Mr McKenzie moved to Townsville to start a new life and although he has been clean for the past 16 months, he said prescribed medication was a big problem in the northern Queensland town.

'There is no heroin here - in the big cities like Sydney and Melbourne you have got a pretty available heroin market - but here it's all black market pharmaceuticals,' he said.

'It all comes back to the fact that heroin was available on prescription for people they would not be using oxycodone and fentanyl - it's a pretty strong convincing argument for regulated supply.'

The accidental overdose death rate is now higher away from the east coast's city lights in Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland, according to the latest statistics commissioned by the Penington Institute in Melbourne.

'Which means that it's almost certainly due to prescription drug misuse,' Mr Ryan said. 

The institute's CEO John Ryan said there has not been a shift in heroin use in regional areas

'For example, oxycodone and fentanyl are powerful opioid painkillers and the number of prescriptions is rising. 'Overdose deaths involving these types of drugs are increasing as community use levels go up.'

Other reasons for the increase in accidental overdoses has been put down to waiting lists for methodone programs and inevitably longer ambulance response times in the regional and rural area.

Mr McKenzie said access to methodone was rare in the Townsville area.

'Here the drug that is used is buprenorphine which is not as strong - it doesn't have that same kind of bang and it can be difficult of people to access treatment,' he said.

Mr Ryan said people rely on painkiller prescriptions more outside of city because there is less access to specialist pain treatment. 

'Methadone programs reduce overall overdose, but in regional and rural areas there are no where near enough prescribers and waiting lists can be years in some parts of country Australia,' Mr Ryan said.

'Doctor shopping is undoubtedly an issue, and in many regional areas there are extensive black markets involving networks covering hundreds of square kilometres,' he said. 

The number of accidental drug deaths (per 100,000 people) in the regional and rural areas has risen by 127 per cent in the past decade up until 2012.

However, it's a different story on the west coast with, Perth coming out on top with more accidental overdoses than anywhere else in the country.

Adelaide was the only other capital city that remained higher in mortalities than the rest of the state with more than double the amount of accidental drug-induced deaths compared to the rest of South Australia during the 10 year-period.

Although figures were not provided for Tasmania, Canberra and the Northern Territory.
