A widow and animal lover is surviving on just £5 a week - because she spends all of her money on feeding her menagerie of pets.

Arthritis-stricken Bernice McTell, 52, who lost her husband Kane in 2009 when he died in an arson attack, says the 'unconditional love' she receives from her three dogs, two cats, four birds and two snakes gives her a reason to live.

The grandmother, who previously spent three years in a coma due to a devastating stroke, spends £160 a month on food for her pets - leaving just enough leftover to pay for a daily tin of soup and some bread for herself.

The 52-year-old claims benefits of £128 per week.

She spends around £80 on rent and bills and more than £40 on pet food, leaving herself with £5 per week to spend on feeding herself.

Mrs McTell said she is 'hungry every day', but that she prefers to spend her cash on her beloved animals.

'If I didn't have my dogs I wouldn't be here,' she said.

'I wouldn't have a life. My pets are my life. They keep me alive, they give me a purpose.

My arthritis means I am in constant pain. I could spend all day in bed, but those dogs give me a reason to get up in the mornings, to go downstairs and open the door.

'I eat just one can of soup a day, and a bit of bread, that's all, so I can feed my pets,' she said, adding that she makes a weekly trip to the shop on her mobility scooter to pick up food for herself and her animals.

'Yes, I'm hungry every day,' she said.

'Sometimes I don't eat until 10 o'clock at night because I'm busy seeing to my pets. But that is my sacrifice, because if I didn't have my animals I wouldn't be here.

'They give me so much, I have to give back to them,' said Mrs McTell.

The widow said she fears
life will only get worse when the so-called 'bedroom tax' comes into force next
month, meaning she must give up £17 per week in benefits or move into a
smaller house.

Sheffield Council has offered to move her from her two-bedroom home of 16 years in Sheffield, South Yorkshire into a smaller home.

But doing so would mean giving up her pets - a prospect Mrs McTell said she cannot bear to contemplate.

'How could I do that to them? They wouldn't know what to do. I couldn't do that to them, they've never done anything to deserve that,' she said.

Two of her dogs, Maverick and Zubin, are Afghan hounds who work their way through large quantities of food.

She also owns Chico the chihuahua, rescue cats Tinkey and Pippin, budgies Sky, Sparky and Gemma, Peter the cockatiel, and snakes Kyla and Kenya.

When Mrs McTell was 25, she suffered a sudden catastrophic stroke that left her in a coma for three years.

'A friend had come to visit, and the last thing I remember is putting on the kettle and popping upstairs,' she said.

'After half an hour my friend came to look for me, and found me collapsed behind a door.

'I was in a coma from the ages of 25 to 28.'

Then four years ago the mother-of-three - by then suffering with excruciating arthritis - suffered further heartbreak when husband Kane, 53, was killed in a fire.

He died alongside two other men when a blaze was started at the house where he was staying in Sheffield January 2009.

A woman and two teenagers pleaded guilty to manslaughter and were jailed.

Mrs McTell, a grandmother to two toddlers, said: 'I have been through so much. I depend on my dogs to keep me safe.

'I didn't used to have this many pets. Before my husband died I only had a dog and a snake, but since then I've got more.

'They're my friends, my company. I know some people say to me that I should get rid of the animals to feed myself but it's not that easy. They are part of me, they are my life.

'I have nursed Maverick back from the brink in the past - he has been so ill I've fed him with a syringe.

'But just as I have saved Maverick, he has saved me.

'Animals offer an unconditional love. They don't judge you like people do. My dogs love me regardless of how I'm feeling or how I look. How could I ever part with them?'
