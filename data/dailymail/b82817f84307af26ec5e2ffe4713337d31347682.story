You've  probably sung along to Abba’s Dancing Queen a million times. But would you be able to recite the words right now?

Apparently not, according to a nationwide poll which found the 1976 classic has the most commonly misheard song lyrics.

Nearly a quarter of those surveyed got the words wrong, believing the Swedish quartet are singing about a rather more violent scenario than one usually played out on dance floors.

Abba's Dancing Queen is one of the most mistaken lyrics with listeners believing they are singing: 'See the girl, watch her scream, kicking the dancing queen'

Even Freddie Mercury is misunderstood with fans singing 'Kicking your cat all over the place'

Some of Jon Bon Jovi's fans lose the run of themselves when he is thought to sing 'it doesn't make a difference if we're naked or not'

Instead of the correct lyric, ‘See that girl, watch that scene, diggin’ the dancing queen’, they thought Abba sing, ‘See that girl, watch her scream, kicking the dancing queen’.

We Will Rock You by Queen was the second most misheard song, with nearly a fifth of respondents thinking lead singer Freddie Mercury says, ‘Kicking your cat all over the place’, rather than, ‘Kicking your can all over the place’.

And even with the clue in the title of the Monkees’ 1966 hit I’m A Believer, 12 per cent think the band are singing, ‘Then I saw her face, now I’m gonna leave her’, rather than, ‘now I’m a believer’.

Fans regularly re-write the lyrics of their favourite bands - sometimes with hilarious consequences

The poll of 2,000 adults found Black Sabbath frontman Ozzy Osbourne was the star who is most difficult to understand, with 28 per cent of respondents struggling to make out his words.

The study by online streaming service Blinkbox Music also revealed that we are less likely to understand more modern genres of music.

Some 56 per cent said fast-paced rap and hip hop songs are the most difficult to understand, while emotive indie-rock songs by bands such as Nirvana came second on 13 per cent.

Veteran US singer Madonna is believed to be far more experienced as listeners think she has been 'touched for the thirty-first time'

US singer Johnny Nash is believed to have been heartbroken by many listeners as he 'can see clearly now Lorraine has gone'

Jimi Hendrix meanwhile has been mistaken as singing 'scuse me while I kiss this guy'

Meanwhile 80s group Starship are accused of building this city 'on logs and coal'
