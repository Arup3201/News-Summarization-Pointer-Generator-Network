England made their final preparations before facing Australia as they took to the field during the captain's run at Twickenham on Friday.

Team captain Chris Robshaw led the final training session before the clash against the Wallabies on Saturday, as manager Stuart Lancaster paid close attention from the sidelines.

Backs coach Andy Farrell has called for a positive end to the QBE series following defeats by New Zealand and South Africa in recent weeks, and the pressure is on for England at Twickenham following comments about the seeming decline in performances since the RBS 6 Nations.

It is a game England dare not lose as the countdown to next year's home World Cup continues, but England backs coach Andy Farrell welcomes the pressure.

'This is a big game. We're disappointed with having lost two games and we obviously want to finish the autumn on a high with a performance and scoreline to match,' Farrell said.

'We want a great performance heading into the Six Nations. I'm excited about this match and the fact we've lost out marginally in a couple of games, albeit we've not been at our best.

'Australia are in a very similar position to us. This match is the end of their season and they want to finish on a high. It's a big game for both teams.

'If you can take the positives out of the defeats then it's that Australia have become the pressure game we want. The bigger the game, the better at this stage.'

England and Australia collide in a pivotal World Cup group showdown at Twickenham on October 3 - Wales also share a heavyweight pool - but Farrell subscribes to the view that events on Saturday will have little influence on what happens 10 months hence.

'Australia are just getting together as a newish side as well. We're all in trouble if we don't improve between now and then,' Farrell said.

'Our performances have not been what they could be, so it's important that we go away with a good feeling within the camp.

'We want to wake up on Sunday morning and say our goodbyes to one another and say that is the standard we want to come back to.

'It will make it a lot easier if we come into the Six Nations on the front foot.'

The stakes are equally high for the Wallabies, who arrive at Twickenham on the back of successive defeats to France and Ireland.

'Australia are renowned for attacking football. They have shown this autumn that they like to run the ball from everywhere. They will be our biggest test defensively,' Farrell said.

England's coaching team will watch Friday night's televised Aviva Premiership clash between Bath and Harlequins in expectation that Sam Burgess will make his union debut from the bench.

Farrell, himself a former league great, believes Burgess must be given time to learn the code.

'In the first three or four months we should cut him some slack and allow him to make his errors, find his feet and work it out for himself,' Farrell said.

'We should all look forward to watching him play and look forward to him getting on the field.

'But don't expect too much, let's judge him farther down the line.'
