A woman who poisoned a stranger's baby with bleach in a McDonald's restaurant had previously hurt children on several occasions, it was revealed in court today.

Elaine Joyner, 53, put the dangerous substance in the 11-month-old baby boy's drinking bottle while his mum and grandmother were distracted in a branch of McDonalds.

But prior to the latest incident in September, the court heard Joyner, from Deptford, south-east London, had thrown a two-year-old girl against a shop window, pushed a one-year-old boy to the ground at a hospital and slapped an 18-month-old child across the face at a bus stop.

Today a judge said Joyner was a 'danger' to very young children and posed a 'serious risk' to the public.

She was given a hospital order that she be detained under the Mental Health Act at Bethlem Royal Hospital in Beckenham, Kent, and placed under an indefinite restriction order 'to further protect the public'.

Joyner, who was declared unfit to plead at a previous hearing last month, had been found by a jury to have committed the bleach poisoning act.

Sentencing her today at Woolwich Crown Court, Judge Andrew Lees said: 'It is clear to me from the evidence that I have read and in the hearing that took place that what you did was an inherently dangerous act which could have caused danger, serious danger, to the life of the baby.

'Mercifully he has a made a full recovery.

'It is clear to me that you have a problem, probably in the form of mental illness and probably in relation to developmental behaviour.

'This is a worrying escalation of dangerous behaviour towards very young children. I am satisfied that you suffer from a mental disorder and in the circumstances that a hospital order is made.

'There is no certainty as to whether there is a real prospect of alleviating the serious risk to the public of serious harm, especially to young children.'

In relation to the incident at McDonald's in Eltham, south-east London, last September, prosecutor Peter Clark said: 'Elaine Joyner gave to a complete stranger's baby a feeding bottle that contained a poisonous or noxious substance, a fluid that contained bleach, or something very similar.

'The baby, who was 11 and a half months old, took some of that fluid in his mouth and was immediately rendered ill by it.

'He retched and vomited over himself and turned very pale.'

The baby, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, made a good recovery with no long-term ill effects.

The child's grandmother said she was looking after the baby in McDonald's while his mother was at the counter and she suddenly saw him retching and dribbling.

She said: 'I reached for a bottle that was in his pram. As I looked into it I noticed it was orange in colour with white milk particles in it. It was extremely frothy on the top.

Sentencing her today at Woolwich Crown Court (picured), Judge Andrew Lees said: 'What you did was an inherently dangerous act which could have caused danger, serious danger, to the life of the baby'

'I realised that he had drunk something that we had not given him. Three black girls said that a woman had walked past and given him a bottle.'

The boy's mother said: 'Some random person had given my baby a bottle, which he had drunk from and was vomiting. As far as I was concerned, my baby had been poisoned.'

In court today consultant psychiatrist Kiriakos Xenitidis said Joyner suffered from a developmental disorder, learning disability, a potential autistic condition, as well as a mental disorder which has psychotic and depressive features.

She was on anti-psychotic medication and had been receiving care in the community since 1996.

The court heard Joyner had a history of harming young children.

In 1997 she tried to hit a group of young children in the street where she lived, in March 2011 she pushed a one-year-old boy to the ground at Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Woolwich, in June 2011 she picked up a two-year-old girl and threw her against a shop window and in July 2011 she slapped an 18-month-old child across the face at a bus stop in Sidcup.

Grey-haired Joyner appeared in court accompanied by hospital staff. She spoke only to confirm her name.
