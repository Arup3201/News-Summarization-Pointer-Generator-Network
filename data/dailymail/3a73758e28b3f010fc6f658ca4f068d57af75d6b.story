Care home nurse Osironke Olugbile, 53, has been struck off after she was caught dragging a screaming resident to bed by the hair

A care home nurse has been struck off after she was caught dragging a screaming resident to bed by the hair.

Osironke Olugbile, 53, also barricaded residents in their rooms, dressed them in multiple incontinence pads and switched off the call bell so they would not disturb her during the night.

The Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) heard that, in addition, Olugbile left pensioners fully clothed overnight so that she did not have to dress them in the morning at the Bupa-run Collingwood Court Nursing Centre in Clapham, south London.

Finding that Olugbile’s actions amounted to ‘serious abuse’, the NMC ordered that her name be struck from the register.

Olugbile was caught when a care assistant, identified as Mr 1, witnessed the hair-pulling incident when the door to a resident’s room was left ajar.

Giving evidence, Mr 1 said he was initially worried about making a complaint after Olugbile said she had a friend with supernatural powers.

‘I was hesitant to report the issue to management because Ronke [Olugbile’s nickname] would often comment that she has someone back home, in Africa, with supernatural powers who will do whatever she says, to the point of killing someone if necessary,’ Mr 1 told the hearing.

Robert Benzyne, for the NMC, told the panel that Mr 1 witnessed the abuse on August 6, 2010.

‘He approached room 59 where he heard screaming and shouting. The door to the room was ajar and he witnessed the registrant pulling Resident A’s hair trying to get her to bed.’

She also turned off the call bell on several occasions, it was said, preventing vulnerable patients from summoning help.

The nurse, who had claimed she was a victim of a ‘conspiracy’, was struck off the register and will not be able to apply for restoration for five years.

NMC panel chairman Clive Powell said: ‘The panel determined that some of your conduct amounted to serious abuse.

'The panel is of the view that you 
demonstrated deep-seated attitudinal and personality issues and a 
complete lack of insight into your failings.

‘Your overall failure 
to accept responsibility and accountability for the patients in your 
care, despite being the nurse in charge and being a role model for your 
colleagues was a serious concern to the panel.

‘The panel noted its determination on impairment, in particular: The panel determined that some of your conduct in relation to the vulnerable residents at the Home amounted to serious abuse.

‘The panel noted that you have not shown any remorse or regret.

‘You have denied these charges from the beginning and have sought to blame others and accuse them of lying.

‘You have sought to abdicate yourself from any personal responsibility for your actions.'

He added: 'The conduct, as highlighted by the 
facts found proved, was an absolute departure from the standards 
expected of a registered nurse.

‘The panel felt that the serious 
breach of the fundamental tenets of the profession evidenced by your 
actions is fundamentally incompatible with your remaining on the 
register.’

Olugbile worked at the Collingwood Court Nursing Centre between 27 March 2006 and 9 February 2011 after registering as a nurse in 2005.
