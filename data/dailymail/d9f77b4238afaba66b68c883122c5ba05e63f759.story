The father: Video of this alleged baby killer holding a police doll and apologizing to it was shown at his murder trial on Monday for the death of baby Ada

A father accused of killing his 21-day-old daughter sat in a Sacramento police station cradling a baby doll saying 'Daddy is so sorry. Daddy didn't mean it,' in a video shown at his murder trial on Monday.

Alleged killer Alias James McLaughlin, 22, told Detective Mark Johnson following his May 2013 arrest that he put his baby, Ada Ann Marie Lam-McLaughlin, down on the ground angrily as she wept uncontrollably.

He reenacted his motions on a police mannequin as he spoke.

'I guess you could say I put her down angrily. I did hear the back of her head kind of cling against the ground,' McLaughlin told Johnson.

The most chilling confession occurred moments later as Johnson left the interview room at the Sacramento Police Department for just a few minutes with an interview camera secretly recording the alleged killer's every move.

McLaughlin picked up the police mannequin one more time and held it as though it were his own deceased child.

'Has Daddy set you free now?' McLaughlin asked the doll.

'Has Daddy set you free? You know, I just miss you, baby girl. I just want to see you one more time, just hold you one more time. I just want to hold you. I’m sorry. Daddy is so sorry. Daddy is so sorry. Daddy is so sorry. Daddy didn’t mean it. You know Daddy loves you. You know Daddy loves you. I didn’t mean it. I didn’t mean it. I didn’t mean it,' he said as the camera recorded his soliloquy.

The detective then re-entered the room to tell McLaughlin he was being arrested for murder.

'You put her down in an angry way,' Johnson told McLaughlin.

'You heard, and you knew what happened.'

'I didn’t murder her,' McLaughlin responded.

'You fractured her skull and it killed her,' the detective retorted.

'I didn’t murder her, sir. … I need to speak to someone.'

The Sacramento Bee reported that Deputy District Attorney Sheri Greco played the tape on Monday to a Sacramento Superior Court jury for McLaughlin's murder trial.

The baby's mother Dalena Lam testified against McLaughlin last week and said that he 'flipped out' on the morning of May 10, 2013 because  21-day-old Ada was crying.

She claims that McLaughlin violently put a pacifier in the baby's mouth then tried to force feed her milk.

Lam said her former boyfriend's actions took a more physical turn as he then shook the baby's ankles and then pushed the baby onto the floor with force.

Lam says she tried to stop McLaughlin but that he shoved her off, bruising her arms and chest.

McLaughlin admitted to a misdemeanor battery of Lam two years ago in Rocklin.

The Sacramento Bee reports that on Tuesday Forensic pathologist Dr. Gregory Reiber joined the prosecution to show the jury autopsy photos of the baby girl along with an example of what subdural hemorrhaging looks like.

Reiber motioned with a laser pointer to a 3.8 centimeter crack at the top of the child's skull.

He also showed the jury the subarachnoid hemorrhage in the baby's brain as a result from the skull fracture.

The bleeding is, 'very typical of a severe diffuse brain injury,' said Reiber.

'Basically, the entire brain was injured,' he continued not the damage was, 'at the very high end of the scale for traumatic brain injury for an infant.'

'It basically causes multiple centers of the brain to shut down,' said Reiber of the truly severe injury.

Reiber explained that the fracture was in line with a 1 meter fall onto a hard surface.

'This is a very severe amount of force,' Reiber told the courtroom.

The doctor was then handed a baby mannequin by the prosecutor that was comparable in size to the infant girl.

In an eerie parallel, the doctor took the doll and slammed it head first onto the witness stand with the same force he believed was used on baby Ada.

As McLaughlin watched the Forensic Pathologist explain the alleged murder he sat expressionless.

McLaughlin chose not to testify in the trial.

He once told a detective he thought his daughter Ada died by choking on her milk but later changed his story.

In the same interview, McLaughlin reportedly looked over a car magazine and tried striking up a conversation with the detective about Mustangs, Camaros, and Corvettes.

The detective eventually intervened and said, 'We gotta talk about more important stuff,' such as, 'you know, your baby.'

That's when McLaughlin chucked away the story where he claimed his baby choked on her milk and instead confessed to 'angrily' laying her on the ground.

'Just the impact of me going like this, and the force – that’s all I did,' McLaughlin said.

'And I heard – I knew at that moment. I knew at that moment.'

On May 10, the day that baby Ada died, her troubled mother attempted to put her in a hot bath because her body grew cold.

The baby later stopped breathing so her parents called police at 3:01 pm and she was later pronounced dead at 6:55 p.m.

Johnson arrested McLaughlin for murder later that day.

'OK,' Johnson said, before telling McLaughlin he first needed to remove all his body piercings. “I need you to take your jewelry out, ’cause you can’t go to jail with your jewelry on.'
