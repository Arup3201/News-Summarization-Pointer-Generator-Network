Shrewsbury Town fans queuing for Capital One Cup tickets against Premier League leaders Chelsea were well looked after by the very players they'll be supporting on Tuesday night.

Supporters reportedly started queuing at 3am but were eased by Shrewsbury players who served tea and coffee them ahead of their fourth-round clash at New Meadow.

Shrewsbury, sitting fourth in League Two, are 72 places below Chelsea but will be keen to give Jose Mourinho's men a challenge with a place in the quarter-finals up for grabs.

Chelsea arrive in Shrewsbury unbeaten and off the back of a 1-1 draw against Manchester United.

Mourinho, having escaped defeat by Louis van Gaal, will now have to be wary of Micky Mellon's Shrewsbury, who beat Blackpool, Leicester and Norwich in their opening three rounds.

Chelsea beat Bolton 2-1 in the third round at Stamford Bridge with a strong line-up that included Oscar, Andre Schurrle, Petr Cech, Gary Cahill and a brief introduction from Eden Hazard.
