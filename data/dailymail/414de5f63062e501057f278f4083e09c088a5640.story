'Neo Nazi': Michael Piggin is accused of plotting terrorist attacks

A Neo-Nazi sixth former who plotted a Columbine-style massacre was bullied by Asian classmates and had no friends up until he started secondary school, a court heard today.

Michael Piggin, 18, drew up a 'hit list' of pupils and teachers and said he wanted to 'eliminate' them.

He also planned to target his past and present schools in Loughborough and the town's university, council offices, mosque and cinema, the Old Bailey heard.

He was arrested last February after drawing a knife in the street and threatening other teenagers.

When police searched his room they found a giant Swastika flag above his bed, a copy of Mein Kampf by Adolt Hitler, military books and a copy of Zero Day, a film dramatisng the 1999 Columbine school shooting.

The court heard Piggin had also stockpiled knives, guns, homemade bombs and a crossbow on his bedroom floor, and kept a journal of his plans to commit mass murder.

The English Defence League supporter, who was just 16 at the time of the alleged plot, planned to carry out mass murder two months later on the April anniversary of the Columbine massacre, jurors heard.

Earlier in the trial the jury was shown a video, allegedly of Piggin spraying anti-Islamic graffiti at a wall in Loughborough before hurling a Molotov cocktail at it.

Today the teenager, who has been diagnosed with Asperger Syndrome, told how he was bullied throughout school, which forced him to move several times.

'People kept starting on me so I went to a different school. I didn't have any friends. I used to go home from school and just read in my room,' he told jurors.

Asked who bullied him Piggin said: 'I was bullied quite a lot by Asians. I remember one incident in particular with a Bengali boy. He beat me up.'

Piggin said his home life was 'unsettling' because he and his mum got evicted from their family home after missing rent payments.

They then went to live with his grandmother but were kicked out following an argument and had to move in with his brother, who is 10 years older than him.

During that time he said he missed periods of school 'because it was more important to find somewhere to live.'

When he did return he saw a counsellor, which he said 'helped' him.

By that time Piggin had made two friends and said he felt 'happy I guess.'

Giving evidence in an Arctic Monkeys T-shirt, Piggin said they were one of his favourite bands along with The Who, Led Zeppelin and The Beatles.

He said he became interested in the military at a young age and had a massive collection of war books and DVDs.

'I was interested to go into the Army when I got older,' he said. And he told how he started collecting 'knives, air guns and BB guns' because he thought it was 'cool.'

'I felt happy when I went shooting,' he said. Piggin and two other 18-year-old boys, who cannot be named, have already admitted possessing petrol bombs and pipe bombs.

However, Piggin maintains he was not planning a terrorist attack. He denies possessing articles for a purpose connected with terrorism, and possession of a document or a record likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism.

The trial continues.
