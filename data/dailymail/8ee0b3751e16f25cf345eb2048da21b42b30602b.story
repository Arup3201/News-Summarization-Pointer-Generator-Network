Surveillance cameras inside a delicatessen have captured the terrifying moment when a 22-year-old crazed gunman opened fire on strangers, killing an innocent college student.

IV Deli Mart was one of ten locations around the University of California at Santa Barbara campus where Elliot Rodger went on a bloody rampage, which left six people dead and 13 others injured.

One of Rodger's victims on Friday night was UCSB sophomore Christopher Martinez, 20, who was shot in the head while getting a snack in the grocery store on Pardall Road in Goleta, California.

The surveillance video obtained by CNN does not show the exact moment when a bullet struck the English major, ending his life, but it conveys a general sense of panic reigning inside the deli.

In the footage, several people are seen standing in line for the cash register waiting to pay for their purchases when Rodger opens fire off camera, sending bystanders diving for cover.

Somewhere to the right of the surveillance camera, Mr Martinez is struck by a round in the head, crumpling to the ground. 

On the left, a refrigerator door is shattered after been struck by a bullet. One of the customers hits the ground and slides on his stomach behind a rack laden with snacks.

Meanwhile, a female shopper drops her purse and a bottle of water, and fumbles to pull her cell phone out of her pocket. 

The young woman in a hooded sweatshirt 
and shorts dials 911 while apparently pointing at the mortally wounded 
Mr Martinez bleeding on the tile floor just steps away from her.

The deadly crime spree in California that left six people dead and 
13 others injured began with three stabbing deaths inside the killer's 
own apartment and concluded with the son of a Hollywood 
bigwig shooting himself in the head.

Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown said yesterday that Rodger began his deadly rampage in his apartment in Isla Vista, where he stabbed to death three men around 9.30pm on Friday night.

The rampage covered a wide area in the vicinity of the UCSB campus with 10 separate crime scenes. 

The bloody saga came to a close when Rodger, the son of The Hunger Games assistant director,  turned the gun on himself, firing a single shot at his head,
 which caused him to crash his car filled with guns and ammunition.

Disturbed: Elliot Rodger, 22, took his own life Friday after murdering six people and leaving 13 others wounded in California

On Saturday, Mr Martinez's grief-stricken father Richard spoke out in an emotional appeal for increased gun control.

'Our son Christopher and six others 
are dead,' he told reporters gathered outside a sheriff's station for a 
news conference. 'You don't think it'll happen to your child until it 
does.'

Mr Martinez Snr choked back tears as he spoke, then grew angrier as he talked about gun laws and lobbyists.

'The
 talk about gun rights. What about Chris' right to live?' Mr Martinez Snr said.
 'When will enough people say: 'Stop this madness! We don't have to live
 like this! Too many people have died!'

He
 then punctuated his words as he said, 'We should say to ourselves: 
"Not! One! More!"' before dissolving into tears and falling to his knees
 as he stepped from the podium.

First casualties: Katie Cooper, left, and Veronika Weiss, right, are believed to be among the seven people slain not far from the University of California Santa Barbara campus on Friday

The massacre perpetrated by Elliot 
Rodger also claimed the lives of Veronika Weiss, 19, and Katie Cooper, 
22, both sisters at the Delta Delta Delta sorority.

The two were struck by flying bullets in the vicinity of the Alpha Phi sorority house. 

The sheriff's department said the rampage was 'the 
work of a mad man,' which started on Friday night with the stabbing of 
three men in Rodger's apartment and ended with him taking his own life.

Before
 launching his deadly attack, the gunman released a disturbing video 
outlining his murderous plans and a rambling 140-page manifesto 
detailing his revenge plot against sorority girls who would not date 
him.

College terror: Police investigate the bloody scene

With his hair dyed blonde, Elliot recalled being the smallest kid in his class at Topanga Elementary School

As the shooting unfolded, residents took to social media to share the news and warn others.

'I
 could have easily been dead right now. RIP to the girls who got shot 
and killed and other people who got run over by this idiot,' tweeted 
one.

'ANYONE IN IV NEEDS
 TO STAY INSIDE. There is a shooting rampage by a white male in a black 
BMW shooting as he is driving by,' wrote another.

Sienna Schwartz said the shooter approached her and said, 'Hey what up?' and then began shooting at her as she walked away.

The
 distressed girl said she initially thought the gun the shooter flashed 
at her was an airsoft gun but realized it was real when three or four 
bullets buzzed past her ears.

Peter Rodger, father of Elliot, is seen in public for the first time since his son's deadly shooting spree

In a statement, the family's lawyer said they 
will be devoting their lives to raising awareness of mental health 
issues and making sure nothing like this happens again

On the surface Elliot appeared to have everything, but he was diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome, a high-functioning form of autism meaning he struggled in social situations

Elliot, who was born in Lambeth, South London, came back to visit three years ago on a trip that took in the London Eye, Harrods and the Houses of Parliament
