A dog died after being rescued from a sweltering car by residents who poured water over its body in a frantic bid to save its life. 

Metropolitan Police were called to St Helier Court in De Beauvoir Estate, North London, on Saturday by residents who noticed the Alsatian in the vehicle.

After tracking down its owner, it was released but collapsed on the floor while onlookers poured water over its  body.

The dog died shortly afterwards in a police van while on its way to animal hospital in east London. 

Its owner, a 27-year-old man, was arrested on suspicion of animal cruelty following the incident on July 26. 

He was released on bail but will return to an east London police station at the end of September.  

The RSPCA received 2,490 calls last month from concerned members of the public worried about the hot weather. 

In the days leading up to the dog's death, 400 calls were placed.

Pet welfare expert Dr Jane Tyson said: 'Hot weather can cause problem for all animals. 

'Every summer we urge people to take extra precautions during the heat but sadly our inspectors on the ground are still being faced with distressing situations that could have been avoided.

'We have already had calls about animals such as rabbits dying in their cages due to the heat and lack of access to water. 

'While we hope the message is starting to get through to people that hot cars can be death traps for dogs, it is really important to remember that other animals may be suffering too.'
