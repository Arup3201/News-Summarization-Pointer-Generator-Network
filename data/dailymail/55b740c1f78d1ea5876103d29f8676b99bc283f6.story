Southampton forward Graziano Pelle celebrated his two goals against Newcastle with a night out with his girlfriend.

The former Feyenoord grabbed a brace in the 4-0 win, and afterwards his girlfriend Viktoria Varga posted a photo on her Instagram account saying: 'Celebrating the 2 goals. So proud of you.'

Pelle joined Ronald Koeman's side for £8m as a replacement for the Liverpool bound Rickie Lambert.

The Italian forward scored 50 goals in 57 matches over the last two seasons at Feyenoord and if his Newcastle performance is anything to go by Saints fans could enjoy quite a season.

Despite a string of high-profile departures from the club, Southampton currently sit fourth in the table, level on points with Manchester City and Tottenham.

Next up for the Saints is a trip to fellow Premier League high-fliers Swansea. 

The former AZ, Lecce and Parma man has scored three goals in four appearances since moving to England
