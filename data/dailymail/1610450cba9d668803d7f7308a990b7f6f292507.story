Australia survived a scare against Kuwait in their opening Asian Cup match as they came from behind to triumph 4-1.

Veteran Tim Cahill sparked the tournament hosts' comeback, while Crystal Palace captain Mile Jedinak also got on the scoresheet for Ange Postecoglou’s side.

The victory at the Melbourne Rectangular Stadium sees the Socceroos get off to a perfect start in Group A which also contains South Korea and Oman.

But after just eight minutes of the competition's curtain raiser that wasn't the case in front of sell-out 25,000 crowd as the unfancied Kuwait took a shock lead.

Nabil Maaloul's side won a corner which defender Hussain Fadhel nodded past Australia goalkeeper Mat Ryan at his near post with a diving header.

Ranked as the second-worst team in the tournament, Fadhel's goal stunned the partisan home support into silence.

The Socceroos are hosting the tournament for the first time in their history and their supporters flocked to Melbourne in their droves as they illuminated the stadium in  green and gold.

And it was a familiar face in Cahill that sparked the home fans into raptures when he equalised just after the half hour mark.

The three-time World Cup star deftly met a pass from man- of-the-match Massimo Luongo just outside the box before driving a shot into the roof of Hameed Youssef's net.

Cahill's goal energised the Australians, who pinned Kuwait deep in its half over the ensuing minutes.

And by half-time their pressure had told as they went to into the interval with the lead through Luongo.

The 22-year-old capitalised on a long pass to head over the outstretched hands of Youssef.

Luongo's goal saw the naturally defensive-minded Kuwait have to change their gameplan as they searched for an equaliser in the second half.

However, Maaloul's men instead made their task harder as Australia extended their lead on 62 minutes.

Australia forward Robbie Kruse was hauled down by Salah Sheikh Alenezi in the penalty area, which captain Mile Jedinak duly conveted from the spot to make the scoreline 3-1.

As Kuwait's stoic defence turned to desperation, Australia ruthlessly hunted for a fourth goal.

Substitute Nathan Burns came close with two shots on goal until James Troisi delivered injury time - lashing home to add extra gloss to the scoreline.

After losing the 2011 showpiece final to Japan, Australia's quest to go one better will continue on Tuesday against Oman at Stadium Australia in Sydney on Tuesday.

1980 winners Kuwait will face South Korea at Canberra Stadium earlier that day.
