Boris Johnson and a string of other leading politicians yesterday admitted paying tradesmen ‘cash in hand’ – 24 hours after a Treasury minister declared it ‘morally wrong’.

David Gauke claimed making small cash payments was as bad as large-scale tax avoidance.

Yesterday London Mayor Mr Johnson said: ‘I have certainly paid a lot of cash in hand.’

Confessing: Boris Johnson, Mayor of London, has admitted paying cash-in-hand after Tory Minister David Gauke, right, claimed such behaviour was 'morally wrong'

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg also admitted it, but said he did not negotiate discounts for doing so.

And sources close to Prime Minister  
David Cameron and Chancellor George Osborne said both men had used cash 
to pay for services.

Business Secretary Vince Cable 
dismissed Mr Gauke’s remarks, saying: ‘Of course, it’s perfectly legal 
and perfectly moral,  providing you’re not doing it with the objective 
of avoiding tax and I certainly wouldn’t do that.

‘There’s nothing wrong with paying people cash. Absolutely nothing wrong at all.’

He added that the real abuse was 
‘multi-billion-pound tax dodges, and that is where the Government is now
starting to crack down hard’.

Mr Gauke made his comments on Monday as the Treasury launched a crackdown on tax avoidance.

He later tried to row back, insisting 
that he meant it was wrong to be motivated by the prospect of a discount
if no tax was paid on the work.

‘I’ve never said to a tradesman, “If I pay you cash, can I get a discount?”,’ he told BBC Newsnight.

Asked if colleagues had, he replied: 
‘I don’t know, but if people do that they have to do so with the 
recognition that that means taxes will be higher for the rest.’

His aides said Mr Gauke had been trying to say that paying cash was wrong if the purpose was artificially to reduce a tax bill.

Yesterday a string of politicians were asked if they had paid cash in hand.

Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt  refused to answer, instead saying: ‘I don’t personally dodge tax.’

James Brokenshire, the Security 
Minister, gave a more technical answer, saying: ‘Would I make cash 
payments to avoid VAT? No, I certainly would not.’

Mr Clegg said he ‘may’ have paid tradesmen cash in hand ‘but never to avoid paying tax’.

Labour leader Ed Miliband said he had 
paid tradesmen in cash and accused Mr Gauke of ‘shooting from the hip’ 
with ‘ill-judged, off-hand comments about plumbers’.

He said: ‘Just because some people are paid in cash doesn’t mean people are avoiding tax.

‘He shot from the hip without thinking about it and just started bandying around words like “morally wrong”.’

Mr Miliband accused the Government of 
targeting tax avoidance to justify the cut in the top rate of income tax
from 50p to 45p for those earning more than £150,000 a year.

But Tory MP Mark Garnier warned that 
continued tax avoidance by tradesmen meant Britain ‘will get ourselves 
into a situation like Greece’.

He said stopping cash in hand payments would increase tax revenue by £120billion a year.

Mr Gauke also came under scrutiny as 
it emerged his wife had worked as a tax lawyer and he once worked as a 
solicitor for a firm that had expertise in tax structures.

Labour MP John Mann accused him of 
going after the ‘working class’, saying: ‘George Osborne and his team 
cannot resist attacking the working classes in Britain, while leaving 
millionaires and large multinationals free to hide money in UK secured 
overseas territories.’

Tax lawyer Miles Dean, of Milestone 
International Tax Partners,  even went so far as to say: ‘Paying the 
plumber, builder or candlestick maker in cash to avoid the VAT element 
is fraud.
