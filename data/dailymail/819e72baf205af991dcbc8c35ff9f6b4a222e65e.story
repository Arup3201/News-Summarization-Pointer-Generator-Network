Bristol City manager Steve Cotterill believes the FA Cup fourth-round tie at home to West Ham on Sunday will be a great learning experience for his side.

The Robins go into the clash on the back of a four-game winning streak and with just once loss in 12 in all competitions.

Two goals from Jay Emmanuel-Thomas helped City overcome Doncaster in a replay while the Hammers required penalties to edge past Premier League rivals Everton at Upton Park.

This is only the third meeting between the sides in 22 years with both games ending in draws during the 2011/12 season when they were plying their trade in the Championship.

City have not beaten West Ham at home since 1977 but, with a little bit of FA Cup magic, Cotterill feels that could change in front of the live BBC cameras.

He told the club's official website, bcfc.co.uk: 'Outside of our dressing room the pressure is off. We have to have a certain amount of belief in ourselves because otherwise we may as well not turn up.

'We know we have to play to our maximum and potentially they have to have an off-day. We may need a little bit of luck, we know that, but these things can happen in the FA Cup.

'We won't be shouting from the rooftops to anyone this week. We're very grounded and if we can maintain that between now and the end of the season, given the relative success we've had so far, that will be great.

'Every time there's been an FA Cup tie we've tried our best and thankfully we've made it through a couple of tough games against Doncaster Rovers to get a shot at a Premier League side.

'I wanted that opportunity for the players to test themselves against Premier League players. They will learn something in this game.'

'I'll enjoy it when we have the ball... probably less so when they have it! All in all it's going to be a really good occasion and hopefully we can play well.

'When you're playing against Premier League teams I think they will let you play because they play. I imagine it'll be a good game, or at least I hope it will be.'
