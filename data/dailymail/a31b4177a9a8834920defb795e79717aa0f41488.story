Steven Powell has been given a release date and is due to be let out of a Utah jail after nearly two years on March 23.

Powell was convicted of 14 counts of voyeurism after taking pictures of 8 and 10 year old girls who lived next door to him.

He gained notoriety for his writings about his daughter-in-law Susan, who has been missing for years and whose two sons were killed by Powell's son Josh in a fiery blaze.

With his son and grandsons dead and his daughter-in-law still missing, presumed dead, 63-year-old Steven is now focusing on holding on to some parts of the past by fighting for his house in Puyallup, Washington.

Next battle: Steven Powell is fighting to hold on to his home even though authorities want to sell it off to pay back his victims

Deseret News reports that the two girls who that Powell took photos of were awarded a $1.8million settlement as part of a civil suit.

After that December ruling, the judge ordered the Pierce County Sheriff's Office to sell off the home since it is Powell's largest non-exempt asset.

Even though Powell didn't contest the $1.8million verdict, he has been putting up a fight to hold on to his house.

The 63-year-old has been acting as his own attorney and filed legal motions declaring that he should be allowed to keep the house because it is his 'homestead'.

If that were found to be true, the sheriff's office would not have the legal authority to sell the house.

No final verdict has been decided but his legal work has at least postponed any lasting turn as the originally-scheduled February 7 sale was pushed back because of his filings.

Different judges' takes on the situation have caused a backlog in the timeline, but Powell wrote in his latest filing that he plans to reside in the Pallyup home when he is released late next month.

Anne Bremner, the attorney representing the mother of one of his victims, said that his filings are simply 'a meritless flurry of motions'.

They have pushed for a ruling that would prevent Powell from filing any more motions for a year, arguing that each time he does so he is just trying to avoid paying off his debts.

Steven Powell's exploits gained national attention after his son Josh killed his own two sons in 2012.

Susan Powell disappeared from her home in December 2009.

Susan's husband Josh Powell, pictured, killed the couple's sons Charlie and Braden and himself after he rigged his house to explode with the three of them inside after they arrived for a court-ordered visit

Her husband, Josh, was a focus of the investigation until he killed himself and the couple's two children in an explosive house fire just moments after a state supervisor dropped them off for a court-ordered visit.

Utah authorities have said they do not believe Steven Powell was directly involved with Susan Powell's disappearance but may know more about it than he has let on.

He had a sexual obsession with Susan Powell that was thoroughly documented in journals seized by police.
