The Antarctic ice sheet is more unstable than first thought with a new study suggesting melting began 5,000 years earlier than previously believed.

The study reveals that shrinking of the 
vast ice sheet accelerated during eight distinct periods between 20,000 
and 9,000 years ago causing a rapid sea level rise.

During one period 14,600 years ago, melting glaciers released so many icebergs into the ocean that sea level rose 6.5ft (2 metres) in just 100 years.

The results provide the first clear evidence for dramatic melting in Antarctic's and reflect predictions for the region's future.

It also follows recent news that destabilisation of part of the West Antarctic ice sheet has already begun and could be 'unstoppable.'

The study was conducted by an international team including researchers from Germany, Canada, Hawaii, Lapland and Australia.

The group examined two sediment cores from the Scotia Sea between Antarctica and South America that contained ‘iceberg-rafted debris’.

This is debris that has been scraped off Antarctica by moving ice and deposited via icebergs into the sea.

As the icebergs melted, they dropped minerals into the seafloor sediments, giving scientists a glimpse into the past behaviour of the Antarctic ice sheet.

Periods of rapid increase in iceberg-rafted debris suggest that more icebergs were being released by the Antarctic ice sheet.

The researchers discovered increased amounts of debris during eight separate episodes beginning as early as 20,000 years ago, and continuing until 9,000 years ago.

Up until now, the melting of the Antarctic ice sheet wasn't thought to have started until 14,000 years ago.

‘Conventional thinking based on past research is that the Antarctic ice sheet has been relatively stable since the last ice age, that it began to melt relatively late during the deglaciation process, and that its decline was slow and steady until it reached its present size,’ said lead author Michael Weber, a scientist from the University of Cologne in Germany.

‘The sediment record suggests a different pattern – one that is more episodic and suggests that parts of the ice sheet repeatedly became unstable during the last deglaciation,’ Professor Weber added.

The research has provided the first solid evidence that the Antarctic ice sheet contributed to what is known as ‘meltwater pulse 1A’,

Meltwater pulse 1A was a period when sea levels rose rapidly from between 52 to 79ft (16 to 24m) around 14,600 to 13,500 years.

The largest of the eight episodic pulses outlined in the new Nature study coincides with this event.

‘During that time, the sea level on a global basis rose about 50 feet in just 350 years – or about 20 times faster than sea level rise over the last century,’ said Professor Peter Clark, an Oregon State University.

‘We don't yet know what triggered these eight episodes or pulses, but it appears that once the melting of the ice sheet began it was amplified by physical processes.’

Vast glaciers in West Antarctica seem to
 be locked in an irreversible thaw linked to global warming that may 
push up sea levels for centuries, according to scientists.

In
 a few hundred years they say the irreversible melt that has already 
started could eventually add four to 12 feet (1.2 to 3.7 metres) to 
current sea levels.

A Nasa 
study looking at 40 years of ground, airplane and satellite data of what
 researchers call 'the weak underbelly of West Antarctica' shows the 
melt is happening faster than scientists had predicted, crossing a 
critical threshold that has begun a domino-like process.

Evidence
 shows 'a large sector of the West Antarctic ice sheet has gone into a 
state of irreversible retreat', says lead author Eric Rignot of the 
University of California, Irvine, and Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory 
in Pasadena, California.

The
 coastal ends of the glaciers rest on bedrock below sea level, holding 
back a vast weight of ice and making them vulnerable to melt, he said.

'It
 does seem to be happening quickly,' says University of Washington 
glaciologist Ian Joughin, lead author of a separate study into the same 
phenomenon.

'We really are witnessing the beginning stages.'

It's
 likely because of man-made global warming and the ozone hole which have
 changed the Antarctic winds and warmed the water that eats away at the 
feet of the ice, researchers said at a Nasa news conference Monday.

'The system is in sort of a chain reaction that is unstoppable,' continued Rignot.

'Every process in this reaction is feeding the next one. It's passed the point of no return.'

Scientists say curbing carbon emissions won't be able to stop the collapse of these glaciers, but may slow the process and at least prevent the them from melting at their current speed

The researchers suspect that a feedback mechanism may have accelerated the melting, possibly by changing ocean circulation that brought warmer water to the Antarctic subsurface.

‘This positive feedback is a perfect recipe for rapid sea level rise,’ said co-author Axel Timmermann, a climate researcher at the University of Hawaii at Manoa.

Some 9,000 years ago, the episodic pulses of melting stopped, the researchers say.

‘Just as we are unsure of what triggered these eight pulses,’ Professor Clark said, ‘we don't know why they stopped.

‘Perhaps the sheet ran out of ice that was vulnerable to the physical changes that were taking place.

‘However, our new results suggest that the Antarctic ice sheet is more unstable than previously considered.’

Today, the annual calving of icebergs from Antarctic represents more than half of the annual loss of mass of the Antarctic ice sheet – an estimated 1,300 to 2,000 billion tonnes.

Earlier this month, Nasa said vast glaciers in West Antarctica seem to be locked in an irreversible thaw linked to global warming that may push up sea levels for centuries, according to scientists.

In a few hundred years they say the irreversible melt that has already started could eventually add four to 12 ft (1.2 to 3.7 metres) to current sea levels.

Scientists say the early stages of collapse have
 already begun and there's nothing we can do to stop it. On the left, the graphic shows the elevation of a region in the West Antarctic that is melting, while theright image shows the
