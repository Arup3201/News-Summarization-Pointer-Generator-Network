Hunt: People are trying to trace this woman, who tried to take a baby from hospital last night

Police are hunting for a woman who tried to take a baby from a cot at a London hospital last night.

The woman said she 'wanted to see' the three-week-old girl as her cot was wheeled between wards at St Thomas' Hospital last night.

She then attempted to reach into the cot, but quickly pulled away. Officers said she did not touch the child.

Police described her as 'a light-skinned black woman' in her early twenties, around 5'2" tall and of slim build. She was wearing a grey-hooded jacket, a red jumper, blue jeans, and is carrying a JD Sports carrier bag.

The baby girl, who was with members of her family and hospital staff at the time of the incident, was then moved into a lift.

They were able to stop the woman from entering the lift with them. She remained in the area for a while before she left the hospital by herself.

Officers are appealing for information from the public so that they can trace the woman.

However, officers from the Metropolitan Police said they do not think the attempt to take the baby was 'serious'. They are not seeking her in connection with any particular crime - and have said instead that they are 'concerned for the wellbeing of the woman'.

A statement from the Met said: 'Police are appealing to trace a woman in connection with an incident at St Thomas' Hospital.

'The incident occurred at around 21.20hrs on Saturday, 11 January, as a three-week-old baby girl was being moved between wards.

Incident: The attempt took place at St Thomas' Hospital in London, close to the Thames

'Whilst officers do not believe this was a serious attempt to snatch the 
baby, they are concerned for the wellbeing of the woman and are keen to 
make contact with her.

'Anyone who knows the woman or has information that could help to locate her is asked to call 101.'
