Swansea are to re-open talks over a deal for free agent striker Bafetimbi Gomis.

The France international is due to travel to Wales on Monday for talks as he considers a move to the Premier League.

Gomis has interest from Newcastle but is only considered a back-up option there while QPR have also considered the 27-year-old.

On the move: Gomis is interested in joining a Premier League club after his Lyon contract came to an end

Deadly: The French striker scored 17 times last season and could demand around £70,000-a-week at Swansea

Swansea bid £8m for Gomis last year while he was still at Lyon and he is keen to talk to them about their plans.

Although he is looking for wages in the region of £75,000 a week, Gomis is still regarded as good value due to his free agent status.

Swansea need a new striker with interest mounting in Wilfried Bony and midfielder Michu.

Wanted: Bony (left) is in demand after an excellent first season while Napoli and Stoke are looking at Michu

Napoli are among the clubs showing interest in Spaniard Michu but Premier League clubs such as Stoke City are also keen.

Swansea are also considering re-signing Gylfi Sigurdsson from Tottenham but face competition from Crystal Palace.
