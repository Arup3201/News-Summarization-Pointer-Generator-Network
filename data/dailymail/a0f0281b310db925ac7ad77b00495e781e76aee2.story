Michael Kingsbury was last seen on Sunday in his local neighbourhood in Washington DC.

Dozens of police and the community helped in the search for him, scouring the local area for clues.

But officers have now found his dead body inside a locked car parked on private property just two apartment buildings down away from where he lived.

The little boy, who was diagnosed with autism, was last seen on Sunday in his local neighbourhood in Washington DC, and dozens of police and the community helped in the search for him

They say the car was checked several times previously by 'at least three officers' and those who helped assist in the search are baffled as to how they missed him. Michael's mother Katrina also claims she checked the car, according to the Huffington Post.

It is not clear when Michael died but police say preliminary results of the autopsy show no signs of trauma. His body had started to show signs of decomposing.

Police have not ruled out the possibility of foul play.

My Fox DC reports that  many who assisted in the search for the little boy are baffled as to how they missed him.

Gaston McVea, told the station that the search team had visited that area four times: 'That was our central location and somehow we missed this.'

The owner of the car has not yet been publicly named, but a police source told the Washington Post  that investigators were talking with the owner.

Unconfirmed reports have said the boy was found on the floor of a locked sedan. Police, who said the car had been searched three times previously, have been criticised locally for not doing enough in the search effort to look for the missing child

Unconfirmed reports have said the boy was found on the floor of a locked sedan.

Police have been criticised locally for not doing enough in the search effort to look for the missing child.

Mr McVea told the Washington City Paper he had passed the car where the young boy's body was discovered several times.

He said: 'That's something that I have to sleep with and live with.

'Because we were that close.'

On Monday his mother Katrina had thanked the community for assisting in the search for her son, who she said was never allowed out unsupervised.
