High street retail giants, including Tesco, Sainsbury's and Topshop, have called for Sunday trading laws to be relaxed on December 23 to give stores a financial boost.

A group of retail stores including Marks & Spencer, Selfridges and Sir Philip Green's Arcadia group of shops have said that a decision to apply Sunday trading hours to the Sunday before Christmas would be 'ridiculous'.

The stores have argued that Sunday will be a crucial trading day this year as Christmas Day falls on a Tuesday and many people leave their shopping until the last minute.

Plea: Retailers are pleading with the Government to relax Sunday trading laws on December 23

Relaxing the hours will leave stores less packed and make for a more pleasant shopping experience for customers, say the retailers.

The trading laws were successfully relaxed during the Olympic and Paralympic Games in London earlier this year.

Sir Philip Green told the Daily Express: 'Extended trading in this instance would give a welcome boost to our high street retailers immediately prior to the biggest gift-giving day of the year.'

A spokesman for supermarket giant Tesco added: 'We know our customers appreciated the extra flexibility on a Sunday around the Olympics and would not be opposed to seeing this repeated, for example around Christmas.'

Sainsbury's said that while it is not suggesting a permanent extension to Sunday hours, it is backing a temporary relaxation for December 23, while Asda have written to the Government asking them for clarity on trading hours for that day.

Chief executive of the UK's fourth largest supermarket chain Morrisons Dalton Philips said that his company's stores will see 2.5million customers through their doors in six hours between 10am and 6pm - the current Sunday trading limits.

He said: 'We're not asking for 24 hour shopping - we're only asking for an extra two or three hours.'

A spokesman for the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills said that the Government will not be giving in to the retailer's pleas.

Splurge: But researchers found presents only account for around half of the Christmas spend

Parents are spending an average of £1,056.82 on their Christmas shopping this year - working out as a hefty five per cent of their salary, a new study has revealed.

Leading online retailer Littlewoods.com worked out that the combination of buying gifts for every member of the family and immediate friends was almost doubled by the ‘Christmas shopping experience’ outlays such as parking, visiting Santa and food and drink.

Their poll showed the average parent intends on spending £551.28 on Christmas presents this year, one third of which being allocated to their children and a further sixth to their own parents..

But despite the average present spend totalling £551.28, it is in fact eight per cent down on last year - which a similar poll in 2011 calculated as being £592.26.

Yet Littlewoods.com found the presents’ cost was only half of the Christmas spend - as 93 per cent of parents do not even factor into their budget the expense of impulse buys, travel, parking and petrol, and food and drink while out on the High Street, which worked out as an additional £505.54.

With the average British parent expecting to shop seven times to gather all their gifting goods - these additional costs all add up.

The additional costs of Christmas present shopping (during the entire festive period) are Food and drink - £178.78; Travel and transport - £133.70; Impulse buys - £110.67; Santa’s Grotto - £45.50 and Christmas donations - £36.89, making a total of £505.54.

The £551.28 present spend added to the Christmas shopping expenses cost of £505.54 makes an average UK total of £1,056.82.

Coming out on top were those in Sheffield racking up a total of £1,173.43, closely followed by those in Birmingham spending £1,158.05.

Other regional big spenders are London - £1,110.14; Manchester - £1,009.27 and Luton - £1,05,75Gary Kibble, Brand Director at Littlewoods.com, said: 'With pennies stretched this year, it’s more important than ever for mums and dads to keep track of where their hard-earned cash is being spent.

'Additional extras can soon mount up without putting further strain on the gifting budget and with 24 days to go, the pressures of Christmas for the nation~s mums are starting to be felt.

'At Littlewoods.com we want to help our customers make Christmas as magical as possible with the ease and convenience of shopping from home and avoidance of hidden extras.'

Research - carried out by One Poll in November 2012. - also found how much we spend on our relatives at Yuletide - for example £202.93 was being blown on our children; £57.50 on mum; £51.75 on dad; £36.90 in total on our grandparents and £28.20 on our mother-in-law.

The Office of National Statistics last year revealed that the average full-time working female earns £22,900 per annum. So based on the average UK mum spending £1056.82 on Christmas shopping, it equates to five per cent of their annual income
