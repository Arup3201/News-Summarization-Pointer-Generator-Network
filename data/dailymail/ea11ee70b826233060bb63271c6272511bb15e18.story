Nearly 95 percent of fruits and vegetables imported to Australia are not tested for diseases before they are sold on the supermarket shelf. 

Experts warn growers in foreign countries are not subjected to the same levels of hygiene as Australian farmers, which puts people at greater risk of infection, the Daily Telegraph reports.

It comes after nine people in various states contracted hepatitis A from consuming packaged frozen berries sold in the supermarket.

'A lot of the countries where we are ­importing food have waterways that are contaminated with sewage,' Professor Peter Collignon, infectious diseases expert from the Australian National University said.

'They are not operating at the same standards as we have here. You don't want to have food that has been contaminated with human waste.' 

High risk foods that are imported to Australia are currently tested but all other foods are categorised as 'surveillance foods', according to a Department of Agriculture spokesman.

Of these surveillance foods, which includes frozen berries, only five percent is tested for diseases. 

The peak body of vegetable farmers say this standard was putting Australians at risk.

It comes after Patties Foods recalled 1kg packets of Nanna's Mixed Berries and the 300g and 500g varieties of Creative Gourmet Mixed Berries at the weekend due to people contracting hepatitis A

'It is of great concern because our growers are being disadvantaged by cheap imports... potentially putting consumers at risk,' Andrew White, AUSVEG deputy CEO, said.

Foods that did fail safety testing last year include cooked prawns from Vietnam (standard plate count), chilli powder from South Africa (salmonella) and Serrano ham from Spain (e.coli), according to the Daily Telegraph.    

Patties Foods recalled 1kg packets of Nanna's Mixed Berries and the 300g and 500g varieties of Creative Gourmet Mixed Berries at the weekend.

The products were pulled off the shelf after three adults in Victoria, two in NSW and four in Queensland contracted hepatitis A from reportedly eating the berries.

The berries, which are sold in major supermarkets including Woolworths, Coles and IGA stores, are packed in China and distributed in Australia by Patties Foods, based in Bairnsdale in southeast Victoria. 

Trudie Sims, from Ballarat in Victoria, is awaiting test results to see if she contracted hepatitis A after using Nanna's frozen berries in smoothies until Sunday.

'I'm really angry... (and) it's absolutely terrified me,' Ms Sims told Daily Mail Australia. 

Doctors say Ms Sims is exhibiting common symptoms of the disease and expect to formally diagnose her with the virus when her results come back on Tuesday morning.

'Over the last two to three weeks I've been getting quite sick and I just thought it was a flu,' Ms Sims said.

Just five per cent of imported food is checked when it gets to Australia - if it fails every item is tested. Roasted peanuts from China detected Aflatoxin last year

Chilli powder from South Africa was found to have traces salmonella

Serrano ham from Spain had traces of e.coli when it was tested in Australia last year

'Last night I just couldn't really swallow anymore and I was going to make a frozen drink like I have been for the last four to six weeks.'

After her partner Trevor alerted her to the health warning  he rushed her to hospital. Since her admission her eyelids have turned yellow and she is exhibiting signs of jaundice.

Ms Sims is also suffering from chronic tonsillitis and a chest infection - likely a result of her body fighting multiple infections.

'I'm massively jaundice and my liver's pretty crappy and these are the first signs of hep A from the berries,' Ms Sims said.

Though still awaiting the definitive results of her blood tests, Ms Sims said her doctor was almost certain she had hepatitis A.

Ms Sims said she felt betrayed by the food company and claims she was misled over the origin of the product which she thought were Australian made.

Patties Foods CEO Steven Chaur said the wider recall was a precautionary measure until the results of further laboratory testing came back.

'We have decided that all our frozen Mixed Berries should be recalled until such time as we receive the results of further laboratory tests,' Mr Chaur said.

'The recall is an important step to ensure public safety and confidence.'

The health department has also told the company to recall the product that contains strawberries, raspberries and blackberries from China and blueberries from Chile. 

Hepatitis A is spread when traces of faecal matter containing the virus comes in contact with hands, water or food, and then enters a person's mouth.

Victoria's chief health officer, Dr Rosemary Lester, said frozen berries have been tied to outbreaks of the virus in the past.

'Hepatitis A virus infection is uncommon and normally associated with travel to countries affected by endemic hepatitis A,' she said in a statement on Saturday.

'The only common link between the cases is consumption of this product - there is no overseas travel or common restaurant exposure.'

NSW Health's Communicable Diseases Branch director Dr Vicky Shepherd said an investigation by all health agencies would help determine how many people have been affected - although some may not be struck down with the infection for a few weeks. 

Symptoms of Hepatitis A include abdominal pain, nausea and fever as well as yellow skin and eyes.
