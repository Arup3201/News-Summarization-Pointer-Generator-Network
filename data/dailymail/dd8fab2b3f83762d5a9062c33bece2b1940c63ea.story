A Little Gay History: The book about exhibits in the British Library which explore homosexual desire has been published in time for London Pride

The British Museum has released a new guide to exhibits in its collection which explore ideas of same-sex love and eroticism.

A Little Gay History, written by curator Richard Parkinson, draws on objects ranging from ancient Egyptian papyrii containing gay chat up lines to Japanese woodcuts depicting men having sex.

It is accompanied by an audio trail featuring actor Simon Russell Beale and artist Maggie Hambling, with the publication timed to coincide with this year's London Pride festival.

Both explore artistic portrayals of homoeroticism throughout the ages, with the book making special discussion of the difficulties in finding the often suppressed records of homosexuality.

'History has all too often been a list of the deeds of famous men who are implicitly 'heterosexual' and usually European,' he writes.

'Unsurprisingly, lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people have often felt excluded and silenced, and without a voice.'

Nevertheless, he notes that museum collections full of classical artwork - from an era more comfortable with the idea of homosexual sex and, indeed, the naked human form in general - have been 'important spaces for people to consider their own sexual identity'.

'Most museums have collections of Greek and Roman statues which show men looking very naked,' he explains, 'so for men who desired other men it was one of the few spaces where they could look at naked male bodies in a culturally respectable sort of way.'

Mr Parkinson, whose speciality is 
Ancient Egypt, claims the oldest recorded chat up line can be found in 
his department - and it involves a pair of men.

It is contained in a poem from 1800BC 
in which one male Egyptian god makes a pass at another, saying 
'neferwi-pehwi-ki', which translates as: 'What a lovely backside you 
have.'

Many of the objects highlighted in A Little Gay History are drawn from classical antiquity. There is the sculpture of the face of the Roman Antinous, at whose death Emperor Hadrian is said to have 'wept like a woman'.

After Antinous' death in AD130 from drowning in the Nile, the emperor proclaimed him a God and spread his image across the empire.

Yet such is the squeamishness with 
which historians have regarded homosexual love, a visitor survey carried
for the museum at a major exhibition in 2008 found that only a handful 
of people knew he was openly gay.

'He commemorated Antinous in statues, religious cults and coins across the Empire,' writes Mr Parkinson.

'It
is said to be the most passionate outpouring of grief for lost love 
that we know of before Queen Victoria and Prince Albert.'

emperor between AD117 and AD138, next to his lover Antinous, adorned with a wreath like a god, at whose 
death in AD130 he is recorded as 'weeping like a woman'

Elsewhere he highlights a battered copper coin showing the image of the poet Sappho, whose homoerotic poetry was so intense that today all gay women are named after the residents of her native Lesbos.

And from the same era, he singles out the Warren cup, a Roman goblet emblazoned with scenes of men and youths having sex.

That artefact was previously owned by the American art collector Edward Perry Warren who called it the 'holy grail'.

From further afield, there is an 18th century treasure chest from New Zealand designed to be suspended so that its intricate carvings representing, among other things, oral sex could be admired from all sides.

The Japanese are represented by a woodblock print that shows two men making love, with one dressed as a woman in his costume as an actor in kabuki theatre.

Mr Parkinson writes: 'People often think that gay and lesbian history is a minority history, but of course it is part of humanity's history. Sexual diversity is something that affects us all.'

The London Pride Parade will take place next Saturday, June 29, in central London.
