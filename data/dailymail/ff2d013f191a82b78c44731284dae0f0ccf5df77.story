A former guard at New York City's Rikers Island faces trial Monday on a federal charge that he deliberately ignored the medical needs of a mentally ill inmate who died after swallowing a corrosive disinfectant.

The trial of Terrence Pendergrass, who prosecutors say was the captain on duty when Jason Echevarria swallowed a so-called soap ball in 2012, comes amid growing calls for reform at Rikers, one of the world's largest jail complexes.

The case was brought by Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara, who has been among those calling for changes at Rikers, which houses some 11,400 inmates on an average day.

Going to court: Terrence Pendergrass is charged with deliberately ignoring a mentally ill prison inmate as he screamed for help after eating a ball of caustic soap

Prosecutors said that in August 2012, a new guard who was unaware of rules requiring soap balls to be diluted in water gave one to Echevarria to clean up sewage flooding his cell.

Echevarria swallowed the ball, which contained highly caustic ammonium chloride, charging documents said. Other inmates heard him banging on his cell door, vomiting and screaming for medical help, the documents said.

Pendergrass was told about the situation by two guards, one of whom had learned from a pharmacy technician that Echevarria could die without help, authorities said.

But Pendergrass failed to arrange for medical care for Echevarria, who was found dead the next morning, charging documents said.

Pendergrass, 50, faces one count of deprivation of rights under color of law, which is punishable by up to 10 years in prison.

Pendergrass has pleaded not guilty. His lawyer, Sam Braverman, declined comment.

Victim: Jason Echevarria swallowed a so-called prison soap ball made of corrosive ammonium chloride in 2012 and died in agony allegedly because Pendergrass failed to act by getting him medical attention

Echevarria's father, Ramon, has sued the city for $40 million over the death.

'It is extremely obvious that he should have been afforded medical care,' Ramon Echevarria's lawyer, Robert Kelner, said Friday.  

The city denies the allegations. 

The federal case against Pendergrass comes during a time of increased scrutiny at Rikers, a massive jail complex that Mayor Bill de Blasio has described as deeply troubled and in dire need of reform.

In August, federal attorneys in Manhattan released a scathing review of juvenile facilities at Rikers, finding guards regularly violated the constitutional rights of 16- to 18-year-old inmates by using excessive force.

And last week, the mayor announced the recommendations of a task force called after a series of reports by The Associated Press detailing problems at Rikers, including the gruesome deaths of two seriously mentally ill inmates. 

De Blasio plans to spend $130 million over four years to improve the conditions for the mentally ill, diverting many of them away from jail altogether.  Nearly 40 percent of the roughly 11,000 daily New York inmates have a mental health diagnosis.
