Times are so tough, even the tooth fairy is feeling the pinch.

She has left on average $3.40 per tooth around the nation â€” or about 30 cents less than in 2013, according to a survey from Visa.

The new number is an 8 percent drop in the national average compared to last year.

'She's had her wings clipped a little bit,' Jason Alderman, Visa's vice president of global financial education, told USA Today.

Despite the drop, prices in 2014 are still higher than in recent years.

In the last five years, the tooth fairy left, on average: $3 in 2010, $2.60 in 2011, $3 in 2012 and $3.70 in 2013.

Tooth inflation brought the price up by more than 14 percent between 2011 and 2012, and then 23 percent between 2012 and 2013.

'Even
 though it is down, this is the first real decline we've seen even 
during the recession because tooth fairy inflation has far exceeded the 
rate of traditional inflation,' Alderman told USA Today.

Market specialists say that the amount of money the fairy leaves is a sign of our economic state of mind and consumer confidence, according to USA Today.

Last year, some 6 percent of fairies left $20 bills for each tooth. This year, less than 4 percent of kids have earned $20 or more per tooth.

'Less money might be a small disappointment for kids, but it's an ideal opportunity for parents to talk to their children about the importance of saving and budgeting,' Alderman said.

Visa, which has been tracking the national dollar-per-tooth average since 2009, says dads are more likely to give kids whatever they find in their pockets while moms tend to be more deliberate about paying up.

On average, fathers say the fairy left about $4.20. For moms, that price was about 45 lower, or about $2.90.

'There is 
no value in having the tooth fairy be excessive,' Alderman told USA Today. 'That 
kind of sanity and stabilization has brought down the average and that's
 a good thing.'
