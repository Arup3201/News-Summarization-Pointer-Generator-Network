A newly revealed video shows a group of high school students callously giggling about a 16-year-old girl's rape ordeal, which was possibly happening at the same time the clip was shot.

The disturbing video is the latest piece of damaging evidence in a horrific rape case in Steubenville, Ohio, in which two former high school football players have been charged.

Throughout the video, which is just over 12 minutes long, there are numerous references to a 'dead girl' who is described as being raped and urinated on.

Laughing boy: The 'star' of the video is Michael Nodianos, a former Steubenville student who can't contain his laughter as he describes the 'dead' victim, seemingly in another room of the house

The case has left Steubenville 
divided, with some getting behind the young accuser and others rushing 
to the side of the players, blasting the girl and claiming that she made up the allegations
 to hurt the football program.

Nate Hubbard, 27, was one of them, telling The New York Times last month: 'The rape was just an excuse, I think. What else are you going to tell your parents when you come home drunk like that and after a night like that?

'She had to make up something. Now people are trying to blow up our football program because of it.'

Deadspin.com reported that the 'star' of the video is Michael Nodianos, a former Steubenville student and baseball player who cannot contain his laughter as he describes the 16-year-old victim, seemingly in another room of the house, being raped.

'She is so raped right now,' he says at one point in the video.

'There won't be any foreplay for a dead girl,' he says. 'It ain't wet now to be honest. Trust me, I'm a doctor.'

The video was obtained by hacker group KnightSec and posted on Deadspin on Wednesday.

Wearing an Ohio State Buckeyes t-shirt, Nodianos jokes that the girl is 'deader than a doornail' and 'they p***** on her.'

He then goes on a tirade of the figures that she's 'deader than,' including Caylee Anthony, 'O.J. Simpson's wife,' John F. Kennedy and Trayvon Martin.

The city’s police chief begged for witnesses to come forward, but received little response.

At least two other people who don't appear on camera interrupt Nodianos to let inform him that the situation is anything but a laughing matter.

'It is rape. They raped her,' one of them says.

Charged: Ma'lik Richmond, pictured, and Trent Mays, both 16-year-old students at Ohio's Steubenville High School, each face one charge of rape and one charge of kidnapping. They allegedly attacked a 16-year-old girl at a party

Later, he chastises Nodianos, saying: 'Like, this is not like funny... what if that was your daughter?'

Nodianos responds: 'But it isn't. If that was my daughter, I wouldn't care. I would just let her be dead.

'And is it really rape if you don’t 
know if she wanted to or not? She might have wanted it. That might have 
been her final wish.'

The names Trent and Ma'lik, are also mentioned in the video - the names of the suspects in the case - Trent Mays and Ma'lik Richmond.

While Nodianos may have thought he was hilarious, he's not likely laughing now, as the video is yet another piece of technological evidence seen as highly damaging to the defendants' case.

Last month, social media's crucial role in bringing the woman's ordeal to the public consciousness was revealed.

Two football players have been accused of raping and kidnapping a 16-year-old girl, who was allegedly drugged, dragged to several different parties, assaulted and urinated on.

The kidnapping charge was later thrown out.

Offensive: A number of offensive comments about the alleged rape were made online, including this one on Twitter; detectives are now trawling through the online exchanges for more evidence

Much evidence from the investigation 
is focused on Twitter and Facebook accounts of those accused in August 
attack, who allegedly provided a gruesome play-by-play of the crime.

Trent
 Mays and Ma'lik Richmond, both 16-year-old students at Steubenville 
High School, each face one charge of rape and one charge of kidnapping.

Mays is also accused of taking photos and a graphic video of the victim, which was posted onto YouTube.

The Times reported that the trouble began with a tweet from Mays, who said on the micro-blogging site: “Huge party!!! Banger!!!!'

Shocking photos of the victim passed out and being carried around by her wrists and ankles were allegedly also being circulated online.

Detectives are now trawling through the online comments to search for further evidence of what happened and whether anyone else should be facing charges. 

Nodianos is the person behind a series of shocking tweets on the night of the incident, including 'Some people deserve to be peed on' and 'Song of the night is definitely Rape Me by Nirvana.'

Fan frenzy: The Big Red plays their home games at a 10,000 seat stadium, where they are broadcast on local television

Besides appalling the small town, online conversations about the incident have left police frustrated that while people are being vocal about the attack, few have come forward to give investigators more information. 

In addition, the Times reported that over the course of the case, a juvenile court judge and the 
Steubenville County prosecutor removed themselves from the case due to a
 conflict of interest.

The judge, Samuel W. Kerr, told the paper: 'It’s a very, very small community 
here. Everybody knows everybody.'

Detectives are investigating reports that the girl was drugged unconscious before being taken from party to party, then raped and urinated on.

Allegation: Both of the boys facing charges are students at Steubenville High School and were on the school's prestigious football team

Returned home, the victim's parents found her disorientated and rushed her to a hospital. 

Mays and Richmond, who were detained in the Jefferson County Juvenile Detention Center before being released on house arrest, were charged with rape and kidnapping on August 24. 

Richmond’s father, Nathaniel Richmond, has protested both boys' innocence.

He described his son as 'a good child, an outstanding student and a credit to Steubenville High School.'

Mays is a quarterback on Steubenville's Big Red team and Richmond is a wide receiver. The team plays games at a 10,000 seat stadium and their games are broadcast on local television.
