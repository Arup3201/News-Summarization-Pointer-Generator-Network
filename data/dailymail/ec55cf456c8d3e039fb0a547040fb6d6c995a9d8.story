Tragedy: Arron Wasdell, 28, died after he was allegedly pushed into the path of a car during a fight outside a pub

A bridegroom-to-be has died after he was allegedly pushed into the path of a car during a fight outside a pub.

Arron Wasdell, 28, died after a disturbance outside the Carters Arms pub in Rhodes, Middleton, Greater Manchester in the early hours of yesterday morning.

Two men, aged 33 and 31, have been arrested on suspicion of murder, and were being questioned by detectives today.

Emergency services were called to the road outside the pub at 12.45am on Sunday morning, and police said the argument had 'resulted in the victim being pushed into the path of a moving car'.

Despite attempts by paramedics to treat Mr Wasdell, he died at the scene. 

'Initial enquiries have established that shortly before the collision there had been an altercation outside the Carters Arms pub between the victim and a group of men,' said a police spokesman.

It is understood Mr Wasdell was engaged to be married to fiance and went to the former Queen Elizabeth School in Middleton. 

Tributes have been left to Mr Wasdell, who was known to many of his friends by the nickname 'Fudge', with a makeshift memorial set up next to the pub, which was closed yesterday with the road sealed off.

Mr Wasdell was a Manchester United fan and a well-known figure at Power Mill, a nearby gym.

Among the flowers left at the scene were pairs of boxing gloves. 'We are going to miss you,' is written on one.

Under a picture of Mr Wasdell, he is described as a 'legend' and 'a small guy with a huge heart and personality'.

A United flag has also been laid at the scene with more tributes written on it, as well as a team shirt.

A note attached to a bunch of flowers read: 'One of the nicest decent happiest people I have ever come across.

'You will be so missed. Was a pleasure to know you mate. I've so many good memories from when we was younger. Truly missed, heaven as gained an angel.' 

Another message left read: 'We are going to miss you. The lads at Power Mill.'

A wreath has also been laid at the spot, while bunches of flowers and cards with heartfelt messages also decorate the posts on a grass verge.

One read: 'My old mate Little Fudge. So gutted you’re going. Craig Wardle.' Another said: “RIP fudge. Gutted to hear the news.'

Friends also took to Twitter to express their sorrow at Mr Wasdell's death. 

Adam Loco wrote: 'RIP Fudge mate. Top lad with a heart of gold.'

Andy Dunn added: 'RIP Fudge. Didn’t know you that well but you always had a smile on your face and was always shadow boxing in the gym.'

Warren Tansey paid tribute to his ‘big heart’ and Adam A Williams added on Twitter:'“Middleton is going to miss you.'

A Home Office post-mortem examination has established that Mr Wasdell died from multiple injuries.

Det Supt Andy Peach, leading the investigation, appealed for witnesses to the incident itself and the fight outside the pub.

He said: 'A man has lost his life after what appears to have been an argument which has got out of control.

'I understand the community will be concerned about what has happened but we believe this was an isolated incident.

'This happened in the early hours of a busy Sunday morning so I am confident there will be people out there with information. If you witnessed the fight or the collision that followed, please contact us with any information.'
