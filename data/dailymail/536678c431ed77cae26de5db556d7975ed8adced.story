Ronald Koeman has been rewarded for Southampton's excellent start to the season with the September manager of the month award.

The Dutchman, who took over in the summer, guided the Saints to victories over Newcastle United (4-0), Swansea City (1-0) and Queens Park Rangers (2-1), leaving them third in the Barclays Premier League table.

And to mark Koeman winning the accolade, we take a look at his life and times as a player and coach.

Southampton boss Ronald Koeman has scooped the September Manager of the Month award 

1. Koeman the player is probably best remembered for that moment at Wembley in 1992 when his drilled free-kick through the Sampdoria wall ended Barcelona's long wait for the European Cup.

With Barca wearing an all-orange strip, it was fitting that a Dutchman should step up to settle a goalless contest that was drifting towards penalties. 

Koeman's strike earned him a special place in Barcelona's history as they won a European Cup final at the third time of asking and a footnote in history as the last goalscorer in the competition before it became the Champions League.

2. This was the most significant of his 88 goals for Barcelona, an incredible scoring record for a defender. His ability to hit powerful right-footed free-kicks proved a real weapon and many will remember the one in a 5-0 thrashing of Real Madrid at the Nou Camp in 1994. 

Signed from PSV Eindhoven in 1988, he joined compatriot Johan Cruyff's 'Dream Team', playing alongside superstars like Romario, Hristo Stoichkov, Pep Guardiola and Michael Laudrup.

Aside from the European Cup, Barca won four consecutive La Liga titles from 1991-1994 and the Copa del Rey in 1990. Koeman was also a fearless penalty taker and holds the La Liga record for his 25 consecutive successful penalty conversions.

3. Loved by the Barcelona fans, he was given the nicknames 'Tintin', because of his resemblance to Herge's fictional character, and dressed up as the adventurer (complete with dog 'Snowy') for a photoshoot during his time at the club. 

His pale complexion also led to Koeman being called Floquet de Neu after the albino gorilla in Barcelona Zoo that lived from 1964 to 2003.

4. Koeman started out at Dutch club Groningen as a teenager and quickly established that reputation of a goalscoring centre half. In his first season there, he found the net on 15 occasions in the league and it wasn't long before Ajax signed him.

Koeman was a fan of the Amsterdam club but it took some time to settle there. Ajax boss Aad de Mos had reservations about his ability and the constant scrutiny almost prompted him to quit the game altogether.

His mum used to write angry letters to popular magazine Voetbal International every time a negative piece about him was published. Eventually, Koeman asserted himself and scored 30 goals in all for Ajax. 

He spent just three seasons in Amsterdam before joining PSV Eindhoven. Led by Guus Hiddink, who encouraged Koeman's attacking gifts, they won three Dutch titles in a row between 1987 and 1989 and the European Cup in 1988. That season proved a real highlight for Koeman, who scored a remarkable 26 goals.

 

5. English fans will also remember Koeman for a certain incident in a USA 94 World Cup qualifier. In the 57th minute of a make-or-break qualifier between Holland and England in Rotterdam, David Platt was dragged down by Koeman on the edge of the area. 

Koeman probably should have gone but German referee Karl-Josef Assenmacher issued only a free-kick and a yellow card. The defender compounded the sense of injustice four minutes later, chipping in a free-kick to send England spiralling out.

The Channel 4 documentary crew filming Do I Not Like That recorded Graham Taylor's reaction as he told the linesman: 'The referee's got me the sack, thank him ever so much for that won't you.' 

Koeman later admitted: 'I expected the red card. I turned around and was surprised to see the referee had not sent me off. I was lucky.'

6. In all, Koeman won 78 caps for his country, scoring 14 goals. His crowning glory came in Holland's 1988 European Championship win and he scored a crucial penalty in their semi-final win over hosts West Germany and was named in the team of the tournament. 

The Holland-Germany rivalry is well documented and Koeman allegedly used Olaf Thon's shirt as toilet paper after the match in Hamburg.

 

7. Koeman comes from a footballing family. His father, Martin, was also a defender, spending a decade at Groningen between 1963 and 1973 and winning one cap for Holland - against Austria in April 1964. 

Ronald's brother Erwin, who is now assistant manager at Southampton, also enjoyed a successful career with PSV, Groningen and Belgian side Mechelen. 

He played a part in PSV's league triumphs in 1991 and 1992, and also won the Belgian league in 1989 and the European Cup-Winners' Cup in 1988 with Mechelen. Erwin played alongside his brother for the Dutch team and the midfielder was part of the victorious 1988 squad.

8. Ronald moved into coaching following his last playing stint at Feyenoord in 1997 and worked initially as assistant to Hiddink for Holland and then Louis van Gaal at Barcelona.

Van Gaal came in as technical director when Koeman was coach at Ajax in 2004 but their relationship became fractious. Van Gaal dismissed Koeman as 'that boy' in his autobiography and suggested he was not first choice to succeed him at AZ Alkmaar in 2009. 

Koeman later said of their disagreements: 'We had some problems in the relation between his job and my job. First he left Ajax and, after three-and-a-half years, I left too. It was difficult because it was a problem in the relation in football. Sometimes a little bit fighting between each other.'

9. After Barcelona, Koeman coached at Vitesse Arnhem, Ajax, Benfica, PSV, Valencia, AZ and Feyenoord before joining Southampton in the summer. There have been plenty of ups and down in this time. 

At Ajax, he managed to lead them to the Eredivisie title and bring through the likes of Rafael van der Vaart and Wesley Sneijder but they ultimately slipped behind in the championship and couldn't regain the ground. 

Since then, he has been pretty nomadic, not staying in a job for longer that a couple of years. He finished just third in the Portuguese league with Benfica but won the Eredivisie with PSV by a one-goal margin from Ajax. He struggled at Valencia and AZ, before failing to win anything at Feyenoord.

10. Koeman has been linked with the Dutch manager's job this week after a poor start to Hiddink's spell in charge. Former player Ronald de Boer was one of those who called for Koeman to take over but the manager insisted he is committed to the Saints: 'I am the manager of Southampton, I am not the national manager and I will not be the next national manager.'
