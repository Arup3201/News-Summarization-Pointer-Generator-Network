A revealing new book about John F Kennedy's final year with his wife Jackie details with explicit detail the fateful day the president was shot on November 22, 1963.Christopher Anderson writes in These Few Precious Days that President Kennedy and his wife Jackie had finally found true love together in a marriage marred by infidelities after the death of their infant son Patrick three months before Kennedy's assassination.That day, as the President and First Lady traveled in procession through Dealey Plaza in Dallas, Texas, Jackie Kennedy watched her husband's face as he was fatally shot by a sniper.

The number of people who believe that the shooting of JFK was due to a conspiracy has dropped 16 percent in the past ten years

Unaware: The couple at Love Field in Dallas, Texas less than an hour before Kennedy was assassinated. Jackie Kennedy would always remember the blood-soaked rose petals strewn after the shooting

His expression would haunt her for the rest of her life.

'He looked puzzled,' she later said. 'I remember he looked as if he just had a slight headache.'

Anderson writes that she watched while, as if in slow motion, her husband's head began to come apart.

'I could see a piece of his skull coming off,' she recalled.

'It was flesh-colored, not white. I can see this perfectly clean piece detaching itself from his head. Then he slumped in my lap.'

The world watched as a stricken Jackie Kennedy crawled over the trunk of the Lincoln the couple were traveling in and reached out. To many, it appeared she was trying to reach out to a Secret Service agent.

In fact, she was grasping for a large piece of her husband's skull and brain that had landed on the car's hood.  

True love: Anderson writes that the President and First Lady had become closer than ever in their final year of marriage after losing their infant son Patrick

Sound impulses recorded on the microphone of a Dallas police officer amounted to evidence of a shot from the infamous 'grassy knoll' in Dealey Plaza, and thus of an additional gunman besides Oswald firing from a building window

She was pushed back into the car, where she cradled her stricken husband's head with her gloved hands, pressing them to his skull 'to keep the brains in,' she said later.

Anderson writes that Jackie Kennedy whispered, 'Jack, Jack, Jack! Can you hear me?'

His blue eyes were wide open and fixed.

'I love you, Jack,' she said. 'I love you.'

The President still had a faint pulse when he was admitted to Parkland Hospital. As doctors began administering a massive blood transfusion, Jackie Kennedy, in her blood-and-gore-soaked Chanel suit, handed doctors what she had been cupping in her hands since the shooting: the piece of her husband's brain.

The doctors tried to force Jackie Kennedy to leave as they worked on her husband, but she refused.

'I will not leave,' she said. 'It’s my husband. His blood, his brains, are all over me.'

Acting on instinct: Jacqueline Kennedy would later say she had no memory of crawling onto the Lincoln's trunk to retrieve parts of her husband's skull

Motorcade: Morley does not suggest the Joannides files point to agency involvement in the assassination itself, but more likely that their release would show the CIA trying to keep secret its own flawed performance before the assassination

When doctors informed Mrs Kennedy that her husband had died, she was unable to speak, simply mouthing, 'I know.'

Medical staff watched as Jackie Kennedy tenderly kissed her husband's white foot, sticking out from beneath the sheet doctors had covered him with.

She pulled the sheet back to expose her husband's face and shoulders.

Anderson writes that Jackie Kennedy later said 'his mouth was so beautiful.'

'Jackie then began kissing Jack again—starting with his exposed foot and then, through the sheet, slowly, deliberately, working her way up,' writes Anderson.

She kissed her husband's foot, then his leg, thigh, chest and finally his lips. According to a doctor, it was the most moving thing any of those who were present had ever seen.

Friends later reported that Jackie Kennedy, usually so spotless, refused to take off her blood-soaked suit, 'as though she didn't want the day to end.'
