New Ukrainian Defense Minister Valeriy Heletey has pledged to retake Crimea from Russian control

Ukraine's newly-appointed defence minster has pledged to to retake Crimea from Russian control promising a victory parade in the key city of Sevastopol.

The parliament in Kiev erupted with cheers following the remark made by Colonel General Valeriy Heletey, 46, a former policeman who previously headed the state's VIP bodyguard service.

Heletey was recommended for the position by President Petro Poroshenko as someone who would work day and night to revitalise Ukraine's armed forces.

In his address, Heletey, who replaces Mikhailo Koval, said: 'Believe me, there will be a victory parade -- there will be for sure -- in Ukraine's Sevastopol.'

Russian troops annexed Crimea, home
 to a Russian-speaking majority, in March following a widely-disputed 
referendum in which 96.7 per cent reportedly voted to become part of 
Russia.

It comes as government troops continue their bloody offensive against pro-Russian rebels in Eastern Ukraine who have declared independence and occupied government buildings.

Ukraine and the West say Russia is helping arm the rebels and letting its citizens cross the border to fight, while key allies France and Germany are pushing Poroshenko to pursue talks over attacks.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Francois Hollande spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin in a conference call yesterday during which they appealed to him to put pressure on the rebels in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions.

President Poroshenko said he was prepared to order a ceasefire providing it was observed by both sides, all hostages were freed and borders secured by government forces.

Poroshenko also appointed Lieutenant 
General Viktor Muzhenko as chief of the military's general staff and 
Yury Kosyuk, an agriculture magnate and one of Ukraine's richest men, to
 oversee defense issues in the presidential administration.

He told the parliament: 'Today the revival of the army is starting from the scratch, the army which is capable of fighting and winning.

'I have witnessed that during meetings with soldiers and officers while visiting the zone of anti-terrorist operations - the army which knows how to and is able to defend its people and country,' he added.

Ukrainian astronomers have named a star 'Putin is a D**khead' in a jibe aimed at the hated Russian president.

The star was adopted and named through the Pale Blue Dot Project, which allows anyone to adopt and name a star for just $10, with the money going to fund the hunt for Earth-like planets.

The co-ordinates of star which is officially named 'Putin Huilo' are: Celestial Star: right Ascension: 18 h 59 m 47.09 s Slope: 46 * 26 '44', 'magnitude: 11.

The term Putin Huilo is belived to have been coined by football fans and was widely chanted at matches, before being picked up by rock bands and becoming a popular internet meme.

It was widely shouted during the Maidan protest in Kiev which resulted in the ousting of President Yanukovych and his government.

Kiev has struggled to re-assert control over the country's industrial east, where fighting between government troops and pro-Russia separatists has claimed more than 400 lives since April.

The army has been unable to prevent rebels from occasionally cruising the countryside in armored vehicles or to dislodge them from the occupied town of Slovyansk.

Yesterday three Ukrainian traffic police officers were shot dead after unknown gunmen wearing camouflage uniforms opened fire.

The incident took place near the main railway station in Donetsk - the largest city in eastern Ukraine, where clashes between government troops and pro-Russia separatists are ongoing.

At least 250 civilians, almost 200 soldiers and at least 800 rebels have been killed in eastern Ukraine since April.

According to figures released by the UN at least 110,000 people have left Ukraine for Russia this year, the majority from eastern regions.

The insurrection started after pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych was driven from office by a protest movement among people wanting closer ties with the European Union instead of Russia.

Russia called Yanukovych's ouster a coup by radical nationalists and seized Ukraine's Russian-speaking Crimea region. Ukraine says Russia is now backing the insurgency.

Poroshenko was elected in a special election May 25 to replace Yanukovych.
