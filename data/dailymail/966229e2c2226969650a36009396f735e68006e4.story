The first professional shot of Marilyn Monroe, taken as a test shot in a Hollywood alleyway before she achieved global fame, has emerged for sale

The first professional photograph taken of Marilyn Monroe, hurriedly composed in an alleyway as a test shot before she began the career that was to make her a star, has emerged for sale.

Renowned photographer Joseph Jasgur took test shots of Monroe before he was to photograph her on Zuma beach in California - regarded as her first official modelling shoot.

When Monroe, then known by her real name Norma Jean Baker, visited Jasgur at his studio in West Hollywood for the test picture he was running short of time and decided to photograph her in a nearby alleyway. 

The test shot, showing a fresh faced teenage Monroe relaxed in a white wool jumper, was taken in March 1946.

It has been referred to by experts as a candid picture of the young girl who went on to become a global star.  

And as befitting her life before international stardom, the actress and model is understood to have gone to a nearby diner for a hamburger and fries after the photo was taken. 

The original negative of the photo is being sold this week at auction after being acquired by a private collector. 

Weeks after the initial snap was taken Jasqur pictured Monroe in a number of locations, most famously on Zuma Beach in a swimsuit.

Andrew Aldridge, of auctioneers Henry Aldridge and Son of Devizes, Wiltshire, said: 'The image was taken on March 6, 1946 as part of some informal test shots that proceeded a formal shoot.

'This image is a true genesis as it is one of the first professional images ever taken of Marilyn.

Monroe became a renowned actress, appearing in Gentlemen prefer blondes in 1953

'Jasgur first photographed her on a small street in West Hollywood behind Beverly Boulevard, where this image was taken.

'He didn't have time in his studio so went outside in the street. It is a very candid picture and she is looking very young with a bit of puppy fat still in her face.

Monroe's first official photoshoot with Jasgur took place on Zuma beach in California when she was 19

'Over the next few weeks Jasgur photographed her on top of Don Lee Towers, above the Hollywood sign and at Zuma Beach.

'This photo offers a unique glimpse of the young girl who was to become the global phenomena that was Marilyn Monroe.'

The negative is valued at $3,040 and will be sold on February 14.
