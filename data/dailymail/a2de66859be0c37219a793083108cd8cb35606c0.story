A missing 14-year old girl has been found in Mexico with the 26-year-old man who she disappeared with days before he was due to face trial for rape.

Mexican officials contacted North Richland Hills police this morning to say that Ruby Contreras and Stephan Cox, 26, who is accused of abusing another girl, had been found.

Both were said to be safe and were being held by police. It wasn’t immediately clear when or where in the country they had been found.

Police in Mexico found Stephan Andrew Cox, 26, left, from Ohio and Ruby Conteras, 14, right, from Texas.

Cox, who is from Ohio, is due to appear in court on charges of unlawful sexual conduct with a minor following a separate incident in January.

In that case a girl, also 14, from North Strabane Township, Pennsylvania, allegedly stole her mother's car to drive to meet the older man she had first encountered online, according to WFAA.COM.

Cox was charged with rape when the pair were discovered.

Keith Bauman, an investigator with the North Richland Hills police near Fort Worth, told the Star Telegram that he was pleased Ruby was returning home.

'This is very good news, we couldn’t ask for a better ending to this investigation.

'The officials of the government of Mexico have been more than accommodating with our investigation.

'We owe our gratitude to their efforts in locating these two individuals and working with us to bring them home.'

Family worry: Ruby's sister Jiovanna Contreras said: 'She always came home at 4:12pm every day'

Police yesterday released surveillance pictures of the pair taken at a convenience store in Abilene, Texas.

They were last seen in El Paso before being discovered across the border.

Cox had been placed under house arrest and was supposed to be electronically monitored, according to the Star Telegram.

Authorities are now working to have the two returned home and the teenager reunited with her frantic family.

Ruby was last seen last week at North Oaks Middle School in Haltom City.

Her family alerted police after she failed to come home from school on April 24.

Officers conducted searches and canvassed the area surrounding the school but were unable to locate the teen.

Investigators believe the pair took a Greyhound bus from Fort Worth to El Paso.

Ruby's family desperately appealed for information in the days after her disappearance.

'I’m scared for her. I don't know what this man is telling her. I don’t know what he's doing. I'm just scared for her,' her sister Jiovanna Contreras told NBC.

Her father Alfonso added: 'I don't know why this happened. I can't believe it.'
