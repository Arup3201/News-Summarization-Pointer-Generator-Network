A woman who lured a school girl into prostitution was back in jail today after she was captured following a nationwide hunt.

Leanne Gilder, 28, formerly of Chadderton in Manchester, was jailed for five years for selling the sexual services of the 14-year-old from the back of a van.

Ms Gilder, who forced the girl to take cocaine before bringing her into Manchester's red light area, was freed last month after serving just two and a half years of her sentence.

Leanne Gilder failed to tell police of her whereabouts under the terms of a Sex Offenders Prevention Order

She checked into a hostel in Preston, Lancs, and was obliged to notify the police of any change of address under the terms of a Sex Offenders Prevention Order (SOPO).

But within 24 hours Ms Gilder left the premises and failed to tell officers of her whereabouts.

Police had been hunting for her since the weekend and tracked her down last night in Peaches massage parlour on Cookson Street, Blackpool.

Ms Gilder today admitted breaching the terms of her release before a sitting of Blackpool Magistrates.

District Judge Alexandra Simmons said: 'You may have had problems at the hostel but you ran knowing you were going to be in breach of the SOPO which is there to protect the public after you committed an extremely serious offence for which you were jailed.'

'You showed a complete disregard for your obligations.'

Patrick Nelligan, defending, said: 'Some of the rules of the hostel in Preston caused her problems. She was not allowed alcohol.'

'She has a great fear of going back to prison and she failed to tell police where she was going and just dug herself into a serious position where the only thing that was going to happen was going back to prison - the very thing she fears the most.'

Ms Gilder was convicted of the child prostitution offence in May 2012.

Manchester Crown Court had heard how she forced the 14-year-old girl to take cocaine before taking her into Manchester city centre to sell her for sex.

After she was released last month, she had tried to evade officers by dying her blonde hair black.

Judge Simmons today ordered Ms Guilder back into custody and added eight weeks to her five-year sentence.
