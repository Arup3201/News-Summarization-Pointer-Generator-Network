Toyota today said it is recalling 1.75 million vehicles globally over brake problems and other glitches that posed a fire risk. 

The Japanese manufacturer cited three problems in several models including its luxury Lexus brand and Crown Majesta.

One issue was an improperly shaped part in the braking system that could lead to a change in the 'feel' of the brake pedal over time .

Toyota has recalled 1.75 million cars globally, including luxury Lexus models and the Crown Majesta

A total of 9,637 Lexus IS, GS and LS models, manufactured between January 2005 and September 2010, are being recalled in the UK due to the fuel issue

That defect affected 802,000 vehicles, mostly in Japan and China, produced between June 2007 and June 2012.

Toyota said the issue, wouldn't render the brake ineffective, but performance could begin to 'gradually degrade'. 

Fuel delivery was an issue affecting 759,000 vehicles, including Lexus models and Crown Majesta made between January 2005 and September 2010, which could increase the risk of a fire 'in the presence of an ignition source'.

More than half of the affected cars were sold in the U.S.

A total of 9,637 Lexus IS, GS and LS models, manufactured between January 2005 and September 2010, are being recalled in the UK due to the fuel issue. 

A problem with 109,000 cars in Japan linked to the fuel-suction plate also posed a fire risk, the firm said. The affected cars were made between October 2006 and October 2014.

The announcement comes about four months after Toyota recalled 2.27 million vehicles over a airbag defect

Toyota said it was 'not aware of any fires, crashes, injuries, or fatalities' linked to the problems. 

The announcement comes about four months after Toyota recalled 2.27 million vehicles over a airbag defect.

Toyota has recalled almost 11 million vehicles since the start of the year.

In February the manufacturer recalled 1.9 million of their hybrid Prius model. 

Despite logging record sales and bumper profits, Toyota has been fighting to protect its reputation as rival General Motors scrambles to contain a deadly ignition-linked scandal.

In March, Toyota agreed to pay $1.2 billion to settle U.S. criminal charges that it lied to regulators and the public as it tried to cover up deadly accelerator defects, which caused vehicles to speed out of control and fail to respond to the brake.

Toyota recalled 12 million vehicles worldwide in 2009 and 2010. 

This week, GM raised its ignition-switch death toll. As of October 10, the number of people killed in crashes because of the defective ignition switches was 27. 

The company waited nearly 11 years before beginning to recall 2.6 million cars, in February, after hundreds of possible accidents and deaths were reported.

By late August GM had acknowledged 13 deaths from crashes related to the problem, in which the faulty ignition could turn off power to a car's power steering and safety airbags while it was in motion.
