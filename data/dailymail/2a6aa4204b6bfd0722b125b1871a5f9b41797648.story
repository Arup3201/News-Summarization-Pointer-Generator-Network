UConn men's basketball coach Kevin Ollie is refusing to  travel to the Final Four this week, the university announced.

Ollie, who led his team to the NCAA men's basketball championship last year, is abiding by a travel ban ordered by Connecticut's governor because of Indiana's new religious-objections law.

Governor Dannel P. Malloy and other critics contend the law would allow businesses to deny service to gays and lesbians based on religious beliefs.

Coach: UConn men's basketball coach Kevin Ollie (seen with players in January 2015) will not be traveling to the Final Four this week, the university announced Tuesday

Champions: UConn was the 2014 national champion and Ollie was to attend coaches meetings and other events surrounding this year's championship

The Democratic governor on Monday signed an executive order banning state spending on travel to Indiana.

Malloy left the decision to travel to the Final Four up to Ollie and the university, which had already paid for much of his trip.

'That's a decision for them and UConn to make, um, what I'm saying is, let's not be silly here,' he was filmed telling reporters. 'There are gay men and gay women who participate in intercollegiate sports.'

UConn was the 2014 national champion and Ollie was to attend coaches meetings and other events surrounding this year's championship.

University President Susan Herbst issued a statement Tuesday evening in support of the governor's ban and said neither Ollie nor any other member of the basketball staff would travel to Indianapolis.

'In support of Governor Malloy's travel ban to the state of Indiana, Kevin Ollie and other members of the UConn men's basketball staff will not travel to Indianapolis for the NCAA Final Four and events surrounding it,' Herbst said.

She continued 'UConn is a community that values all of our members and treats each person with the same degree of respect, regardless of their background and beliefs and we will not tolerate any other behavior.'

Issues: Many, including Democratic Indiana State Rep. Ed DeLaney (pictured on Saturday), have protested the state's new law

Indiana Gov. Mike Pence (seen Tuesday) urged lawmakers Tuesday to send a bill to his desk by the end of the week to clarify the intent of the new law

NBC Connecticut reported Ollie and staff members would have gone to National Association of Basketball Coaches. The convention will be held in Indianapolis from April 2 to April 6.

Warde Manuel, UConn's athletic director, told The Associated Press on Monday that he also finds the law unacceptable.

Manuel said he hopes the state of Indiana rectifies the situation before UConn or any other institution considers a boycott of the 2016 women's Final Four, which also is being held in the city.

'They have a choice to make and I think others have choices to make on whether they'll spend money at the businesses in the state of Indiana,' he said.

Ahead of the announcement, Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) told NBC Connecticut 'I wouldn’t presume to give advice but if I were in their shoes I would stay away. I think they can send a very powerful message as all of us can.'

The University of Southern California's Athletic Director Pat Haden also tweeted Tuesday 'I am the proud father of a gay son. In his honor, I will not be attending the [College Football Playoff] committee meeting in Indy this week. #EmbraceDiversity.'

Indiana Gov. Mike Pence urged lawmakers Tuesday to send a bill to his desk by the end of the week to clarify the intent of the new law.

The Republican governor said he does not believe that lawmakers meant to create a vehicle to allow discrimination.
