It seemed like a great idea at the time. But when actor Aidan Turner took to Twitter for a BBC #AskPoldark Q&A last night, polite questions were the last thing on fans' minds.

Instead, the 31-year-old Irish actor was deluged with queries that ranged from the bizarre to the thoroughly indecent.

Marriage proposals also proved popular with Poldark fans taking part in the Twitter Q&A, which took place immediately after the fourth episode of the drama aired, as did requests for an uptick in shirtless scenes.

Inundated: The 31-year-old was deluged with bizarre questions and marriage proposals from fans

'AskPoldark will u marry me? I think you're bloody gorgeous Aiden xxx' asked a fan named Julie during the Q&A.

'How do you ever stop looking in the mirror?' asked a Twitter user called SammyPie.

Others just seemed overwhelmed. 'Like most women (and quite a few men) I cant think of anything sensible to #AskPoldark once Aidan takes his shirt off. Sorry,' wrote one hyperventilating fan.

Another, named Sarah Hook, asked: '#AskPoldark why was I never offered the position of painting semi nude actors when I had my careers talk at school?!'

Turner, although slow to respond to marriage proposals, gamely attempted to answer many of the more sensible questions offered up by fans, including one about his new-found fame.

Nice work! Another wished that her careers' advice had included tips on becoming a make-up artist

Asked whether he knew that a Twitter account dedicated to his hair existed, the Irishman answered: 'I am aware, yeah! It’s pretty hilarious!'

Not everyone was happy with his answers, however, with one fan complaining that Turner took longer to answer than his character did to find copper - a reference to the ongoing plot line about Poldark's mining activities.

'Did he answer any of the questions or has he been removed to some sort of high security location for his own protection? #AskPoldark', wrote another fan named Katy Moran afterwards. 

Most, however, contented themselves with firing questions on everything from gardening to the pedestrianisation of Norwich city centre at the actor.

Gardening: Another popular topic with fans was gardening - in particular the scything of lawns

Left field: Others offered up some more unusual questions about the election and Norwich city centre

Too slow: Others complained about the actor's slowness to answer questions

Among the more amusing was a question from a Twitter user named Linda who asked the actor whether he might be interested in a spot of gardening.

'My mower has packed up,' she wrote. 'Would you come round and scythe my lawn please? #AskPoldark'

Another, David Hussey, offered up a tongue-in-cheek query that read: 'AskPoldark thinking of ditching the wife, running off with a red-haired wench and opening a copper mine. Any tips or pilchard recipes?'

Most entertaining of all was a fan who quizzed Turner on his plans for life post-Poldark. 'Would you consider presenting Top Gear?' asked Adele Mitchell.

Turner chose not to answer that one.
