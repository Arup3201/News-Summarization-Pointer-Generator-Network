A divorce lawyer from Seattle has been accused of bilking one of her clients out of more than $100,000 and is now facing felony theft charges.

King County prosecutors claim Dana K. Fossedal made off with money that was awarded to her bus driver client, as part of a settlement.

According to court papers, Mrs Fossedal, 41, raided a trust account that held the man's money and used it to pay personal expenses.

Dana K. Fossedal, 41: She is a divorce attorney accused of making off with more than $100,000 owed to one of her clients. Fossedal now faces felony theft charges after raiding the account where the cash was being held

After being hired by Fossedal, the man was awarded $117,000 as part of the settlement.

However, instead of receiving the money directly, though, the settlement payment ended up in a trust account held by Fossedal.

Although Fossedal's bill for representing the man was less than $10,000, she cleaned out the entire account.    

According to Seattle PI, she is alleged to have done so without ever acknowledging the settlement had been paid.

Steven Nels Fossedal: After Dana Fossedal's client sued her and and won a $162,000 judgment, only a small amount of that debt has been paid with the court seizing her husbands (pictured) pay as part of the settlement

Her client ultimately sued Fossedal 
and won a $162,000 judgment but only a small amount of that debt has 
been paid with the court seizing her husbands pay as part of the 
settlement.

Fossedal has been charged with first-degree theft.

If
 the charges are proven, it would appear the attorney who has been 
practicing for 16 years took advantage of her client when they were at 
their most vulnerable.

Fossedal even purports to be a great navigator during times of crisis on her website.

'
 I have a great deal of skill helping to guide my clients through these 
confusing and overwhelming times with knowledgeable advice and 
representation, coupled with respect, understanding, and compassion. The
 legal process can sometimes be cold, confusing, and overwhelming, 
especially if you are already dealing with an emotional family 
situation. Unlike a contract or business dispute, in family law, you are
 laying the most important and valuable people and things in your life 
before the court.'Fossedal's license is now suspended pending the outcome of the charged.

Many
 of her former clients would find the details of the current court beg 
to differ with the treatment they've received according to some of her 
online reviews.

'I do not 
recommend Dana Fossedals,' one client wrote who was having a will 
prepared. 'It was incompetently done according to another attorney with 
mis-spelled names, lack of page numbers and most of all, didn't really 
qualify as a legal will since it was so incomplete. Avoid this attorney -
 it was a humiliating and frustrating experience.'

Another
 client who used her to facilitate their divorce is even more damning in
 their judgement saying that calls at emails were not returned.

'I
 feel that this attorney had only her own interests at heart. She gave 
every excuse for this from blaming her assistant to technology, just to 
name a few. She was home sick, on vacation or just plain gone more than 
not. When questioned why commitments made were not met, her responses 
were frequently quite defensive.

Paperwork,
 spreadsheets and letters took forever to get composed and many times 
were full of errors found by the opposing side, requiring much rework. 
She spent a lot of time fighting over small stuff that cost more in 
billing hours than the items were actually worth. The case was dragged 
out way longer than was necessary.'

A final review has echoes of the current court case.

'We
 feel very mislead with this attorney. Our retainer was paid almost 4 
months ago and after many promises, we feel we have been mislead. There 
still have been no papers filed or completed, we do not get timely (if 
any) return phone calls, we consistently have to call the office and 
leave messages without a response.'
