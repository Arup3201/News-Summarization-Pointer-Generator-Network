A super slimmer who became agoraphobic after being attacked three times has told of her amazing recovery which has seen her regain her independence and shed an incredible seven stone.

Sue Bushnell, 51, was left petrified to leave her home after she suffered recurring violent incidents in her line of work as a bookmaker in Harehills, Leeds, West Yorks., forcing her to leave her job four years ago.

Afraid to leave the house without her husband or daughters, Sue resorted to comfort eating and her weight soared to 18-and-a-half stones.

Before and after: Super slimmer Sue Bushnell lost a staggering seven stone after being held at gun point while working as a bookmaker drove her to comfort eating

Finally, after encouragement from her youngest daughter Sarah, 25, Sue - who was also suffering from post traumatic stress, sleep apnoea and high blood pressure - joined Slimming World.

Now, just 18 months later, Sue has escaped from her own virtual prison as a confident and independent woman - and a svelte seven stones lighter.

Mother-of-three Sue said: 'The first incident was when I was going to bank the takings from the bookmakers. I was jumped from behind.

'Six weeks after that I was working in the shop when someone barged in and started pointing something at me.

'I thought it was a gun so I threw myself on the floor. Next I heard the man laughing and leaving the shop with the cash from the till.

'The next time, it was a real gun. I was petrified and I couldn't go back into work after that.'

Comfort: After the attack Sue developed post-traumatic stress and would feast on chocolate

None of the perpetrators were ever caught and Sue was diagnosed with post traumatic stress.

She left her job of 11 years and became trapped inside her own home.

She said: 'I started getting flashbacks and terrible nightmares. I couldn't go out of the house because I would have panic attacks.

'I found it difficult to even have family and friends round to our house and would sometimes have to retreat to my bedroom.

Helping hand: The mother-of-three was motivated to lose weight and join Slimming World by her daughter Sarah

'Food was my only comfort. I would eat when I wasn't even hungry. I wouldn't have any proper meals because I couldn't concentrate on cooking.

'I just snacked on whatever was in the fridge. Chocolate was my biggest downfall.'

Sue joined Slimming World after taking inspiration from her daughter.

'Sarah joined in November 2010 and I'd watched how she flourished,' said Sue.

'I was becoming more worried about my health, and Sarah encouraged me to go with her.

'I
was so nervous and just stayed by her side the whole night. But after a
couple of weeks I started to look forward to going. All the women were
lovely and they were so supportive.

'Gradually, as I went more, my confidence grew. I even started getting out and about, going for walks with my husband Alan.

Such a difference: Sue has not only lost seven stone but she also feels happier, healthier and more independent

'For years, I had felt trapped, not only because I was embarrassed about my appearance but I was also terrified of being in other people's company.'

Sue has lost seven stone and a few weeks ago she went to the supermarket on her own for the first time.

She said: 'When I got home, I had the most brilliant feeling. I was so proud of myself. I'd always been independent until this happened, and then I started to rely on everybody else. But now I'm starting to be my own person again.'

Sue has progressed so well that she came in the top 50 of Slimming World's Women of the Year 2012.
