Martin 'Mad Dog' Allen returns with the latest instalment of his new weekly column for MailOnline Sport. The former Gillingham boss does not hold back with his views on current issues in football.

This week, Mad Dog has his say on Steven Gerrard's new playing position, Arsenal's 'Amen Corner' for the rest of the season and how former non-league stars Charlie Austin and Jamie Vardy could be ready for the Premier League.

G-FORCE FINALLY CONTROLLED

For all these years, Steven Gerrard has had the freedom to make, create and execute anywhere on the pitch he desired.

His most successful time has been under Rafa Benitez playing in the No 10 position behind Fernando Torres.

He had that freedom to link the midfield, supply those brilliant passes and save his energy from traipsing back over the halfway line to protect his back four.

Class: Steven Gerrard used to excel in a No 10 role, but he has shown his qualities playing as a 'quarter-back'

Grit: The experienced midfielder puts in tackles, and controls the tempo for Liverpool

I've often thought his brilliant attacking play was a hindrance to the success of the team, through his lack of defensive responsibility, which has been proven with average years at Liverpool – bar one or two cups – and through poor results in the England national team.

But now it's different. With Lucas injured, Steven is their catalyst, their quarter-back.

He has a responsibility to play with discipline and control, to anticipate the oppositions strengths; to block, intercept, and defend the dangerous areas around Liverpool's goal.

I believe this will be like having a new player for England at the World Cup in Brazil.

Whether Roy Hodgson will choose Steven to play in that role in Brazil is debatable.

With the climate and the opposition probably going to have the majority of possession I'll be interested to see how Steven fits into Roy's team in the summer.

Path to success: But will he play in that role for England in Brazil?

AUGUSTA ANXIETY EATING AWAY AT THE TOP

With all the experience and quality that Arsene Wenger has at his disposal he described the performance against Manchester United last week that would've taken them to the top of the league as 'nervous'.

We've all seen it time-after-time, year-after-year, in all different sports.

My favourite analogy is around Easter in football when the teams are twisting and turning. It is like the Amen Corner of the Augusta Masters.

The muscles get tighter, they hit the ball 20 yards further, the simple putts end up eight feet past and a standard eight iron going between 162-164 yards ends up at 180 and deep in the water.

Trouble: Amen Corner is where the best are often find wanting at the Masters Golf Tournament at Augusta

Nervous? Arsenal may have hit that wall in their title challenge

The mind and the emotions can play havoc and the nervous energy drains the body. We've all been there.

We've seen it for years as England supporters in their penalty shoot-outs, which highlights more than anything how anxiety can effect performance at key moments.

The worst thing any supporter can do now is to boo their players, constantly criticise them and get on their back.

ALL THE PLAYERS NEED IS A HUG

Last year when I was in charge at Gillingham we lost at home to Wycombe Wanderers live on Sky television at the beginning of February and got booed off.

At the time we were still four points clear at the top of the League Two table.

My players were shattered, they were drained and they played with no energy.

I'm sure the paying public would've expected a Mad rant and rave from me in the dressing room. But, instead, I hugged every player, reinforced positive thoughts and, taking the bad days in our stride, we marched onwards.

Different motivation: Sometimes, all the players need is a hug, rather than a meltdown

Title challenge: Maybe Jose Mourinho will try a similar tactic?

The last thing they wanted, or needed, was me growling in their faces.

Low-and-behold, only three months later, we were crowned champions for the first time in over 50 years.

Who will win the Premier League?

It'll be the team that controls their emotions and copes with the tension through to the finishing line.

NOTHING SURPRISES ME IN THIS MAD WORLD OF FOOTBALL

How crazy is it that two of the top teams in the Championship have got centre forwards banging in the goals that, up until just a few years ago, were playing in the Conference?

Well I go to watch lower-league football on a regular basis, and it doesn't shock me.

Jamie Vardy, at Leicester, was playing for Fleetwood Town part-time and working a full-time as well less than two years ago.

Started at the bottom: Charlie Austin (left) and Jamie Vardy have proven that you should never give up

And Charlie Austin was a bricklayer playing for Poole Town in 2009 when he was scooped up aged 20 by Swindon.

Neither player went through the academy system; both were let go, deemed not good enough and both have shown that with hard work and dedication you can fight back and make a living after that heart-breaking rejection.

For me players are released far too early before they have reached their maximum development and, more often than not, the heartbreaking conversation that ends their dreams finishes their career.

However, Vardy and Austin are currently in the process of fast-tracking themselves and their clubs into the Premier League to mix it with the very best in the world.

COOK HAS GOT THE RECIPE FOR SUCCESS

On Tuesday night, I went to watch my local team Wycombe Wanderers take on Fleetwood Town.

A minute before kick-off, the Chesterfield manager Paul Cook came bouncing up the stairs in the directors’ box on a scouting mission.

The Cook, as I call him, had driven down straight after training and got caught in the motorway madness.

I noticed, as he scrambled for a pen, he was still in his club tracksuit and training kit from the afternoon session.

The fragrance was powerful – but it was the smell of success.

Talented: Paul Cook has the flavour for success at Chesterfield

I asked him why he was there and he told me: 'There's nothing like watching it yourself, so it's got to be done.'

At that level as a manager you have to mix so many ingredients and blend them all together to succeed. He is certainly getting the flavour right at the moment.

The next morning he was in at 9am when the players had a day off, to work on the weekend's game against Torquay and then watch his reserve team that afternoon.

It's no surprise that the Cook is sitting top of League Two, three points ahead of his nearest rival with this man set to be a champion.

Last week, at BT Sport for my Tuesday night spot on the Sports Hub, I went into the make-up studio.

Before you go on air they powder your face to stop the shine on the cameras. To clarify: This is standard practice, it's normal.

However,
 as I was about to get off my chair and leave for rehearsals the 
beautiful young lady there decided, without asking me, to apply some lip
 balm.

I sat there – 
frozen in shock – as she applied what felt like lipstick, and thought: 
'Oh my God. I hope no-one is filming this!'

I
 thanked her and immediately upon leaving that room wiped it all off on 
to my shirt, hoping and praying nobody saw me with those shiny, pouting 
lips.

Not for me: Funnily enough, I didn't fancy having lip balm put on!

I was also lucky enough to be treated to dinner in Canary Wharf with my two sons George and Charlie on Thursday night.

George is off for four months to work in Johannesburg for his company KPMG.

Now, my George is an extremely bright spark when it comes to figures – and even more so when it comes to settling the bill.

While
 I thought I was being treated in a posh restaurant at the top of a sky 
scraper with all the City whizz-kids, I experienced once again George's 
skill, as a chartered accountant, with figures.

Even though his dad is out of work, as the bill came he looked across the table and said: 'Thanks dad, it's great to see you.'

I nodded, paid and was a very, very proud dad.
