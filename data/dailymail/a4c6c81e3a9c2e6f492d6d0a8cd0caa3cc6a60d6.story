A 42-year-old woman previously arrested for cheering her daughter on in a fight with another teen has found herself in trouble with the law again - this time for public sex.

Cops in Brandenton, Florida busted April Newcomb and her 20-year-old boyfriend having sex on the side of a truck in a Beef 'O'Brady's parking lot at the dinner time of 6pm.

Newcomb and her much-younger lover Brandon Tinyes were arrested and charged with lewd and lascivious behavior and exposure of sexual organs.

According to the Manatee County Sheriff's Office report, witnesses at the restaurant called police when they saw the couple 'engaging in sexual activity on the side of a red pickup truck'.

When the officers showed up at the restaurant, they found Newcomb and Tinyes naked from the waist down with Tinyes 'thrusting his hips back and forth'.

The officer says he also witnessed Newcomb with her legs wrapped around Tinyes, making a 'moaning' sound.

The incident happened outside a Beef 'O' Brady's restaurant around 6pm

The couple were in view of those walking in the parking lot, and the officer noted that it was 'full of foot travel'.

When approached, the couple separated and said 'they were friends and having sex'.

Both were arrested and booked in Manatee County Jail. Tinyes made bail first, but was also hit with an additional charge for marijuana possession.

Newcomb was held on $620 bail before her release.

This isn't the first time Newcomb has been arrested.

In 2010, she was booked after caught encouraging her daughter in a fight that was video taped and posted to YouTube.

In one of the videos, Newcomb can be heard yelling 'Don't fucking stop' and 'punch her in the fucking body'.

She pleaded no contest to a charge of delinquency of a minor and was sentenced to 75 community service hours for the misdemeanor.Â
