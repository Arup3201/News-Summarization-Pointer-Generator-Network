No-one it seems, is too elite to take a leaf out of Kate Middleton's style book when an important occasion calls, and that includes Chelsea Clinton, America's former first daughter.

For when Chelsea emerged from Manhattan's Lenox Hill hospital yesterday evening cradling three-day-old baby Charlotte, she was dressed in near-identical attire to that worn by Kate last year when she first left St. Mary's Hospital in London with Prince George, now 14 months old.

Chelsea's pale printed cornflower-blue dress, cut just above the knee, was slightly looser than the one worn by Kate, and she sported a fresh blowout - albeit a slightly less immaculate one than Kate's. All in all, however, the look was the same: fresh, modest, new-motherly.

Chelsea descended the steps of the hospital with little Charlotte wrapped in white swaddling, sporting a pair of low-heeled wedges - just like Kate did - flanked by her adoring husband, Marc Mezvinsky.

Marc, an investment banker, made like Prince William, both first-time fathers, and stood protectively just behind his wife, letting she and baby Charlotte take center stage.

He went one further in the public affection stakes, however, when he delivered a quick kiss to the top of Chelsea's head for all the world to see.

Charlotte, whose birth-weight hasn't been released, was a surprise to Chelsea and Marc, who choose not to find out the sex of their unborn child. 

Kate and William on the other hand, knew they were expecting a boy, George, who weighed in at 8lb 6oz.

Eagerly awaited: Baby Charlotte's (left) birth-weight has not been revealed and her sex was kept as a surprise for her parents. George (right) weighed in at 8lb 6oz and Kate and William knew he would be a boy

Chelsea had the iron-clad support of her parents, former US president Bill Clinton and Senator Hilary Clinton, who accompanied the new couple out of the hospital. Kate's nor William's parents were present on the hospital steps for their big reveal.

Kate, now pregnant with her second child, won widespread praise for choosing the dress she did for George's unveiling last July - a custom-made Jenny Packham polka dot number - which made no attempts to hide her post-birth mummy tummy. In fact, it made a show of it.

Chelsea, whose looser dress swamped her curves, gave birth at 7.03pm Friday night, and announced the news a few hours later.

Rabbit in the headlights: Both Marc (left) and William (right) appeared somewhat overcome by their new-found fatherhood and the media circus surrounding them

Details surrounding the actual birth have not yet emerged, but Chelsea stayed in the hospital for a full three days before checking out.

Kate, who left the hospital only one day after giving birth, later described her own 11-hour labor as 'perfect.'

An insider told Vanity Fair last year: '[Kate] said it was straightforward and there were no complications. She wanted a natural birth and she was so happy she was able to have one.'

Easy peasy: Kate, who left the hospital only one day after giving birth, later described her own 11-hour labor as 'perfect' 

The dress: Pale blue paisley design with short sleeves, cut just above the knee and loose-fitting 

The shoes: Royal blue suede low-heeled wedges with rounded toes

The hair: An almost-straight blowout, left with a natural kink 

The make-up: Minimal, with just a faint hint of lipstick

Demeanor: Beaming with unrestrained pride, joy and excitement 

The dress: Cornflower-blue polka dot empire-line design with short sleeves, cut just above the knee, custom-made by Jenny Packham

The shoes: Cream low-heeled sandal wedges with rounded toes

The hair: Kate's trademark blowout; sleek and finished with loose waves

The make-up: Polished, with groomed brows, blush and a hint of eyeliner

Demeanor:Glowing,elegant but evidently tired and a little nervous 

Bill and Hillary met their granddaughter for the first time on Saturday, and shared photographs of them cooing over the baby, declaring themselves 'over the moon'.

Moments before, Chelsea had shared the first picture of her daughter, which shows her cradling the baby next to her husband.

The couple, who married in July 2010, announced in April that they were expecting their first child.

Precious cargo: Hands-on William packed his new son George into a black SUV and drove his new family away from the hospital himself

Duties: Hilary and Bill arrive at Chelsea's Manhattan apartment shortly after they leave hospital to settle baby Charlotte into her new home

Bill and Hillary had been publicly gushing for months at the prospect of becoming grandparents, though Chelsea's exact due date had been kept quiet.

In a recent TV interview, former President Bill said: 'I hope by the first of October, I'll be a grandfather.' 

Happily for him, his wish was granted.

Gushing grandparents: The Clintons have made no secret of their longing for a grandchild - and posted this picture in celebration when Charlotte was born

'We are in love': Chelsea posted this picture of her holding Charlotte with husband and new father Marc shortly after the birth

Last week, Hillary also excited fans as she told a crowd at political steak fry in Indianola, Iowa: 'Bill and I are on constant grandchild watch. So don't be surprised if we suddenly go sprinting off the stage.

'I want to babysit any chance I get,' she added.

When Chelsea announced her pregnancy during a Clinton Foundation event devoted to empowering young women, she told guests: 'Marc and I are very excited that we have our first child arriving later this year. 

Luxurious: The Manhattan-based Lenox Hill hospital suite Chelsea chose for her birth offers huge, well-appointed rooms such as this  (pictured)

Royal chambers: Kate opted for a room similar to this one (pictured) in the private Lindo Wing of St. Mary's Hospital in London, where Princes William and Harry were born decades before

Hilary added: 'I certainly feel all the better whether it's a girl or a boy that she or he will grow up in world filled with so many strong, young female leaders.

'I just hope that I will be as good a mom to my child and hopefully children as my mom was to me.'

Kate's carefully staged-managed outfit for the day she introduces the world to the second royal baby next year remains to be seen. Chances are that, when that day comes, Chelsea will be watching closely.
