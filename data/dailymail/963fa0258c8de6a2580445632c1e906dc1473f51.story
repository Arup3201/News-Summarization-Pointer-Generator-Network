Remorse: The Syrian boyfriend of Mueller, pictured, posted the message online after her captivity and death became public

Kayla Mueller's Syrian boyfriend wrote a remorseful heart-wrenching message after her death became public apologizing for not doing more to save her.

The man, a Syrian photographer who has not been named for fear of his safety, posted the message online after Mueller's death in the hands of ISIS captors became public. 

According to friends, the 33-year-old man was taken to prison alongside her but was later freed. He then staged a desperate, single-handed rescue attempt, but failed to secure her release.

In a long account of Mueller's life published by the Arizona Republic, it is revealed that he posed as her husband and tried to secure her release - but the plan was foiled when Mueller said she was unmarried.

The couple had reportedly often described themselves as husband and wife while traveling through Syria and neighboring Turkey to suit the countries' conservative attitudes.

A spokesman for the family confirmed the couple had been together since around the end of 2013, though they met as early as 2010.

In the message, posted to a public Facebook account, he man wrote: ''Dear Kayla, I'm not writing her to say goodbye, this is a thank you.

'Thank you for coming into my life and giving me joy, thank you for loving me and receiving my love in return.

'(Y)ou supported me in everything I did, even if it was extremely stupid. ... l'm writing to tell you l'm sorry about so many things. I'm sorry l didn't 't take better care of you...

'I'm sorry I didn't try harder to find the words, to tell you what I was feeling. And how much I loved you..'

Two two were captured together in August 2013 on the road to Aleppo, despite repeated warnings.

Previously published accounts of her final journey told how the boyfriend had just fixed the internet connection at a Doctors Without Borders outpost when they were captured by jihadists.

By September, the boyfriend had been freed, and had posted on Facebook about his capture.

According to the Republic, he said: 'Now i am free and free and free... Thank you for everyone who asked about me.

Rescue attempt: The man was freed while Mueller remained captured - but returned in an attempt to save her

'Sorry for not contacting each one of u. Im very tired now. I'll be online later inshallah [God willing]. Thank u for your love.'

He is thought not to have mentioned or acknowledged her publicly online while she was in captivity, for fear it could affect negotiations over her release.

However, shortly after he is said to have posted the following poem on his account, apparently in reference to Mueller.

'My heart is in your detention cell

'its lives your pain all day

'you are not alone

'you are not alone'

Mustafa Abbas, a Syrian TV journalist, told the Republic that he headed back into Syrian in late 2013 in the hope of rescuing her.

He was freed again after two months, but Mueller remained imprisoned.

U.S. forces mounted a rescue operation in an attempt to save her, alongside journalist James Foley, who was later beheaded - but the operation was not a success.
