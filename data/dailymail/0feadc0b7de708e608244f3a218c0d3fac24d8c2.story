Taco Bell has launched a new advert for their breakfast menu where they appear to compare competitors McDonalds to a communist dictatorship.

The fast food restaurant launched its new 'biscuit taco' this week in a bid to build on its breakfast business, which started one year ago.

But in their new ad campaign, they once again go after dominant morning player McDonalds by depicting a brainwashed society, where miserable people eat the same Egg McMuffin-type sandwich. 

The new advert for Taco Bell's 'biscuit taco' shows a man waking up to be told by his TV that 'Happiness is the same breakfast' 

The two and a half minute TV ad then shows people lining up behind each other while waiting to be given breakfast 

When they get to the front of the queue, they are then given Egg McMuffin-type sandwiches, while looking bored and miserable 

The two and a half minute TV ad shows a man waking up and being told repeatedly that 'Happiness is the same breakfast'.

It then shows him lining up with other people and as they get to the front of the line, they are handed a muffin-type sandwich.

The ad then cuts to a shot of a dictator dressed in similar clothes to Ronald McDonald, with his men also wearing similar clown make-up.

However, the man featured at the start of the ad then decides to break away from the line along with a woman and they then escape.

The ad also features a dictator-type character, whose make-up and clothes seem to resemble Ronald McDoanld 

The new ad is similar to a campaign last year that featured real-life people named Ronald McDonald professing their love for Taco Bell offerings

After running through the streets, they climb through a hole in the wall and reach a castle, where they are given a biscuit taco.

The ad then finishes with the website breakfastdefectors.com flashing up on the screen.

Even though McDonalds is not mentioned explicitly, it is clear which company they are poking fun at.  

In addition Taco Bell is running a poster campaign in New York and Los Angeles, with one featuring a demonic looking clown holding what looks like an Egg McMuffin with the words 'Routine Rules'

It is a continuation of an ad campaign last year that featured real-life people named Ronald McDonald professing their love for Taco Bell offerings.

This prompted McDonalds to tweet a picture of Ronald McDonald kneeling down to pet a frail Chihuahua, which was once the mascot for Taco Bell.

The launch of the Taco Bell breakfast menu has helped to drive up sales at the chain, with CEO Brian Niccol saying breakfast has been holding steady at six per cent of sales.

It is not clear what impact this is having on McDonald's Corp, which has been struggling to hold on to customers amid intensifying competition.

But others have also been pushing into the breakfast category more aggressively, including Starbucks, which revamped its sandwiches last year.
