As the worst drought in decades continues to plague large swaths of the nation’s breadbasket, a tale of archaeological intrigue has emerged to provide a silver lining.

As Indiana's Salamonie Lake dries up, a former town has surfaced after being submerged for nearly half a century.

The unrelenting drought has uncovered the long-buried remnants of Monument City which was one of three tiny towns sacrificed when the Salamonie reservoir was created in 1965.

Drought: The reservoir's waters have receded by more than 12 feet to reveal the foundations of long-ago demolished buildings, bricks from the old school house and dirt tracks

The unrelenting drought has uncovered the remnants of Monument City - one of three tiny towns sacrificed to be flooded when the Salamonie reservoir was created in 1965. The town's estimated 30 residents were forced to relocate as it was razed to the ground and flooded

The tiny town was established in the late 1870s and covered a mere 13 acres or so.

But in 1965 Monument City’s estimated 30 residents were forced to relocate as it was razed to the ground and flooded.

And now the waters have receded by more than 12 feet to reveal the foundations of long-ago demolished buildings, bricks from the old school house and dirt tracks.

After locals flocked to see the site of the city and started taking away souvenirs, the state Department of Natural Resources have begun offering supervised tours.

That the town is now under the 
spotlight now is ironic as ‘no real big thing’ went on there when it was
 still running, says Paul Stanley, who went to school there.

81-year-old Dick Roth also went to school in Monument City in 1949, where he was in a class of six.

'I just didn't believe they could put that much water there. But they did,’ he recalled to NBC news.

The lake was built as a flood-control reservoir to save local towns.

While the latest forecast says the 
drought will linger in the nation's breadbasket and parts of some 
mountain states at least through November, conditions aren't expected to
 get worse.

This 
January through July has been by far the hottest start of the year in 
U.S. weather records dating to 1895, and there's about a 
two-out-of-three chance that 2012 will set a new record for the U.S.'s 
warmest year, NOAA climate scientist Jake Crouch said.

NOAA records say that 1998 was the warmest year on record in the United States.
