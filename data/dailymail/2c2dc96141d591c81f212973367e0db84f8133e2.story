This is the remarkable moment staff and passers-by help a woman as she gives birth to a baby girl at a high-speed railway station in China's Henan Province.

Liu Qi, who works at the Hebi East Railway Station, was thrust into the role of midwife and rushed to the waiting room with a stretcher upon hearing the news that a woman was about to give birth.

Liu said the woman was unable to walk at the time and that he and several other stewards were needed to assist her and her family.

But as they waited for the ambulance to arrive, the baby’s head started to appear and the stewards were required to react immediately.

Liu held the woman’s head back and placed her onto the stretcher before the ambulance finally arrived and medics could take over.

After cleaning the mother and her newborn, the medics transferred them both to a hospital where they could be checked over properly.
