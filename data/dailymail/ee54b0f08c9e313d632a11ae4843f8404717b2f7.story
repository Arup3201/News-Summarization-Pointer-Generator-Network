Losing appetite: Cone sales plummeted last year and Cornetto was the worst hit with a 14% drop

If the weekend’s warm weather had you heading for the supermarket freezer cabinet, chances are you weren’t stocking up on Cornettos.

Traditional ice cream cones are falling out of favour, with more Britons opting for indulgent 500ml tubs and luxury brands, says a report.

Sales of cones have slumped 5.5 per cent in the past year, while demand for tubs of ice cream, including brands such as Ben & Jerry’s and Häagen-Dazs, has rocketed.

According to trade magazine The Grocer, we got through 7.2million more tubs of ice cream last year than in 2012 – an 18 per cent rise.

Data from market analysts Kantar 
Worldpanel show that overall volume sales of ice cream rose 3.4 per cent
 year on year to 341.1 million litres while value sales grew 6.9per cent
 to £839.6 million.

The 
study says the hot summer played a big role in boosting the performance 
of impulse lines with volume sales of luxury ice cream tubs also soaring
 by 18.1 per cent.

Cornetto has been one of the worst hit by the decline of the cone, according to the magazine, with sales plummeting nearly 14 per cent in the past year.

In an attempt to revive fortunes, manufacturer Unilever plans to launch a new product this month – Cornetto Choc ‘n’ Ball – which features a cone topped with a chocolate-covered ice cream ball.

The firm has tipped the new invention as 'the ultimate manly snack'.

Unilever said it 'caters specifically for male consumers seeking a substantial snack offering'.

Meanwhile, Ben & Jerry's is developing new products to cater for the growing appetite for frozen yoghurt.

One new range is the Greek-style forzen 
yoghurt tubs which come in three flavours: strawberry shortcake, vanilla
 honey caramel and raspberry chocolatey chunk.

Tidy: During the hot summer months, Britons opted for drip-safe tubs rather than traditional ice cream cones

'The new products will launch to grow current and anticipated consumer and category trends - such as the growth seen in frozen yoghurt, luxury desserts and handheld formats and the trend towards consuming ice cream as a snack,' Unilever said.

There will also be a line of 'gelato' Carte D'Or products designed to cater for the rise in luxury desserts on family shopping lists.

The firm said it will 'enable consumers to bring the Italian gelato experience into their homes'.
