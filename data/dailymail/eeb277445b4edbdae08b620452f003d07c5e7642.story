Labour ministers ‘suppressed’ warnings about hospitals blamed for causing thousands of needless deaths, a senior Government adviser said yesterday.

In a devastating intervention, Professor Sir Brian Jarman said previous health ministers had presided over a ‘denial machine’ designed to prevent criticism of the NHS.

A report by the NHS’s medical director, Sir Bruce Keogh, tomorrow will detail a shocking catalogue of failure at 14 hospital trusts held responsible for up to 13,000 ‘excess deaths’ since 2005.

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt is expected to place at least 10 of the hospitals in ‘special measures’ immediately, with NHS troubleshooters parachuted in to take over what are described as ‘failing regimes’.

Investigation: Lincoln County Hospital is part one of 14 hospital trusts where 'excessive deaths' are being examined

Casualty, maternity, geriatric and other units could be shut down as ministers order drastic action to prevent further unnecessary deaths.

The report will also highlight a culture in which warnings of dangerous practice were routinely ignored or buried.

Ministers received 386 separate warnings about conditions at Morecambe Bay NHS Trust alone between 2005 and 2010.

Sir Brian, an expert on hospital death rates who was an adviser on the report, said: ‘The Department of Health seems to have been, until recently, a denial machine. There has been a denial of the death rate data.’

He said Labour ministers had been in denial about the issue for most of the last decade – with the result that health regulators were actively discouraged from highlighting problems.

He told Sky News: ‘The Government that was responsible for providing the service was, uniquely, also monitoring its quality. So you had a conflict in which where there was a problem with quality they couldn’t really say what it was.

‘Things were suppressed, (there was) spin, everything ... effectively they had to produce a good news story for ministers.

‘The impression in those days was, the problem was ministerial pressure, even from Number 10.’

Sir Brian also criticised the controversial NHS chief Sir David Nicholson, claiming that he had misleadingly suggested that the scandal at Mid Staffordshire trust hospitals was a one-off.

His comments drew a furious response from shadow health secretary Andy Burnham, who served as health secretary in the last year of Gordon Brown’s government.

‘To be honest, I’m fed up of these general accusations being hurled in my direction,’ he said. ‘I will account for all of the things that I did as secretary of state.’

Mr Burnham insisted he had acted on warnings, including ordering a report into the Mid Staffs scandal and handing warnings to five other hospitals with high death rates.

He said he had never received a ‘specific warning’ about Morecambe Bay. And he claimed the situation at some of the hospitals had got worse since the election.

But one Downing Street insider said the Government planned to give Labour ‘both barrels’ when Sir Bruce Keogh’s report is published tomorrow.

A Tory source said: ‘We now know Labour set up a hopeless regulator whose views shouldn’t have been trusted.

‘Andy Burnham allowed people with no medical training to inspect hospitals. It was a disaster waiting to happen.

'Despicable': A coroner heard four separate inquests in one day over 'incompetence' at Tameside Hospital

‘But what is shocking is how Labour Ministers – including Andy Burnham and even Gordon Brown himself – appear to have been leaning heavily on officials to keep problems covered up.’

David Cameron commissioned the Keogh 
report in February after Robert Francis QC’s inquiry into the Mid Staffs
 scandal exposed appalling lapses in both care of patients and the 
regulation of hospitals.

Sir Bruce has been examining 14 hospital trusts that have been outliers on mortality indexes over the last two years.

He
 also examined infection levels, the number of patients suffering from 
preventable and potentially fatal neglect and numbers of so-called 
‘never events’, such as operations on the wrong part of the body or 
surgical instruments left inside a patient.

Between them, the 14 hospitals have paid £234 million in negligence settlements in the past three years, although many of the cases will date back far longer as the legal battles often take several years.

Infection: Tom Davies, 84, died after contracting MRSA while in Tameside Hospital with a fractured hip

Former RAF pilot Tom Davies, 84, died from MRSA after being admitted to Tameside General Hospital with a  fractured hip.

The treatment he received there was ‘despicable’, the coroner said.

According to his family, the twice-widowed grandfather was often unable to reach his meals because his table was too far from his bed.

His son Ivor, 58, said: ‘On one occasion I found my dad lying in his own excrement which had dried on the bed sheets.

It was after Mr Davies pointed out filth smeared over an abscess on his  father’s leg that nurses cleaning him up discovered the infection, which turned out to be MRSA.

Mr Davies, who flew in Burma with the RAF during the Second World War, died on April 5, 2006. ‘I have no doubt he would still be alive today if he’d had  better care,’ his son said.

Details of Mr Davies’ death formed one of four separate inquests heard in one afternoon by coroner John Pollard in which relatives in all cases complained of incompetence at Tameside General.

Mr Pollard said staff had failed to carry out the most simple tasks. He added: ‘I would have concerns about any  hospital which was referred to in four different inquests in one day where people raise doubts about the basic care given to their relatives.’

The 14 hospital trusts are:  Basildon and Thurrock in Essex; United Lincolnshire; Blackpool; The Dudley Group, West Midlands; George Eliot, Warwickshire;  Northern Lincolnshire and Goole; Tameside, Greater Manchester; Sherwood Forest, Nottinghamshire; Colchester, Essex; Medway, Kent; Burton, Staffordshire; North Cumbria; East Lancashire; and Buckinghamshire Healthcare.

Mr Hunt will announce tomorrow that most of the hospitals are still failing and will be placed in so-called special measures. Troubleshooting teams will be sent in with a free hand to order changes.

Mr Hunt last night said: ‘Poor care in the NHS is completely  unacceptable which is why we  commissioned this review. For too long problems in the NHS have been allowed to go on unchecked. We will act in the best interests of patients and ensure that where problems are found we take action immediately.’

Senior Tories believe the row could help to neutralise Labour’s poll lead on the NHS.

Some on the Left also believe it poses the party a challenge.

Labour’s former general secretary Peter Watt said: ‘The Left is going to have to find a much better response to the series of NHS scandals than “I love the NHS”.’
