A man wanted over an assault and domestic violence incident has mocked authorities who are pursuing him by posting a 'selfie' of himself standing in front of a police station.

Aaron Bee, 22, is wanted in connection with an assault and an incident of domestic violence last Wednesday Lincolnshire.

The father-of-one first taunted Lincolnshire Police last Friday by saying on Facebook he 'always liked playing hide and seek'.

Aaron Bee took to social media after Lincolnshire Police had launched a bid to find him, saying he 'always liked playing hide and seek' and he later joked that the authorities' efforts to track him down were 'fun and games'

But yesterday the father-of-one taunted police further by posting pictures of himself on the social network site standing outside Lincoln Police Station.

Yesterday, Mr Bee said: 'I did it because it's funny. Its (sic) just a bit of fun really. If I've got one message for the police it's 'come catch me if you can'.'

Lincolnshire Police launched their appeal to find Mr Bee who is wanted in connection with an assault and an incident of domestic violence last Wednesday.

After failing to find him at his home in Lincoln officers turned to the public's help for information.

They released a photo of Mr Bee, who then took to social media that evening to mock the force's attempts to trace him.

He branded the pursuit as 'fun and games' and joked 'I always liked playing hide and seek as a kid.'

Writing on his Facebook page he added: 'How come my photo is all over Facebook ? Anybody would think iam (sic) wanted or something …'

He added on Monday: 'Anybody have an idea on a new hiding place ? Theese (sic) rabbit hutch Are getting boring !!!!'

A friend, Nicole Laura Stiff, commented on his photos and said she thought Mr Bee 'was joking' when he said he was going to evade the authorities.

Another friend, Phil Rowe, said Mr Bee's comments were 'Funny as' and added that Lincolnshire police were the 'worst hide and seek players ever'.

Mr Bee took to his Facebook page again yesterday to say the officers were not serious about tracing his whereabouts.

'It's really funny, I wanted to do it to show how ridiculous this all is and how they obviously aren't that bothered about me.

'They are making me out to be a mass murderer of some sorts but I'm not a violent bloke. But they can't even find me.'

Mr Bee added: 'Its only criminal damage and assault and I haven't even been found guilty of them yet.

'I'm not going to hand myself in, they will have to track me down but they haven't tried that hard to find me.

'I was just enjoying the thrill of the chase but it's started to get boring now.'

Lincolnshire Police confirmed they were still looking for Mr Bee.

A spokesman said: 'We are aware of comments made by Mr Bee on social media.

'He is clearly upset that we wish to speak to him. His forthright manner will not divert us from our quest to arrest him.

'Should he wish to attend Lincoln Police Station to discuss the situation we will be very pleased to accommodate him.' 

Detective Chief Inspector Nikki Mayo, of Lincoln CID, said today: 'We are aware of his activity on social media and are actively following up a number of leads and lines of enquiry.

'I would remind members of the public that the offences for which Mr Bee is a suspect are of the utmost seriousness.

'Tackling domestic abuse and violence is a priority for the force and we have a duty to protect not only the victims involved but also the wider public as a whole.

'I would urge anyone who knows of Mr Bee's whereabouts to inform us as soon as possible so that matters can be dealt with.'

Anyone with information is asked to contact Lincolnshire Police on 101 or contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
