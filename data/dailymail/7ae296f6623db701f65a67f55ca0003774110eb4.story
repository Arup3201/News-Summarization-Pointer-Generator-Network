An afternoon messing about in a nearby stream ended up taking two bored 11-year-olds on a journey back to prehistoric times when they stumbled across a 13,000-year-old mastodon bone.

Eric Stamatin was hunting for crayfish behind his backyard in Troy, Michigan, with his cousin Andrew Gainariu when they spotted what they thought was a rock in the water.

On closer inspection, the boys noticed a large hole in the middle of the object and wondered if it might be something else.

But when they took it home to Eric's mother, she guessed it was probably just a cow's bone and it sat on a shelf in the dining room for months.

It was only when she finally contacted a paleontologist in November they realised they had in fact found a second vertebrae in the spinal column of an American mastodon.

'Oh my gosh, we were liked psyched,' said Eric, from Shelby Township, after learning of his discovery, which he made in a branch of the Clinton River in June.

Thought it belonged to a cow: The bone was a second vertebrae in the spinal column of a mastodon (pictured) which roamed America until their extinction around 10,000 years ago

Mastodons lived from about the Oligocene of the Paleogene period, about 30 million years ago, in North and central America until about 10,000 years ago.

Although similar to elephants and woolly mammoths, they are not that closely related.

They are thought to have become extinct due to nomadic hunters and an abrupt climate change when temperatures plunged to glacial conditions.

'I thought it was a rock at first, but a 
couple minutes later I looked more at it. I didn't think it was a 
dinosaur bone, but I wasn't sure.'

The mastodon, which resembles a woolly mammoth although not closely related, roamed the plains of North and Central America until their extinction around 10,000 years ago.

John Zawiskie, a geologist and paleontologist at the Cranbrook Institute of Science, rushed over to Eric's house to tell them the news.

He told CNN: 'Every once in a while - by construction workers or exploring 11-year-old boys and girls - something like this comes to the forefront and reminds us of the incredible history of Earth's landscape.'

Eric is now preparing to give his science class their 'coolest' show-and-tell ever.

'I feel really special,' he said. 'People said it's just amazing how I found this.'
