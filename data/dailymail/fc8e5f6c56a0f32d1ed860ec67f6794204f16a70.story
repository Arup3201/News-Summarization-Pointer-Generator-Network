A breastfeeding mother has spoken of her fury at being asked to cover up in a restaurant while she was trying to feed her three-month-old daughter.

Ellie Hiscox was celebrating her birthday at a pizza restaurant in Manchester, which she deliberately chose because she had previously breastfed there without any complaints.

But when she asked a waiter if she was allowed to feed her baby daughter Jocelyn at the table, he said she had to cover up.

The employee told Ms Hiscox that customers had previously complained about breastfeeding mothers - but a manager later apologised to her, and said that she should have been allowed to feed her daughter freely.

Anger: Ellie Hiscox was told she could not breastfeed daughter Jocelyn in a restaurant without covering up

The issue of breastfeeding in public has become a controversial topic recently after a mother was ordered to cover herself while nursing her baby in top London hotel Claridge's.

Ms Hiscox, 30, went with her mother and daughter to Dough Pizza Kitchen, in Manchester's Northern Quarter, to mark her birthday earlier this month.

Even though she breastfed Jocelyn during a previous visit, she decided out of politeness to check with a waiter that it was all right to do so again - but he said it was not.

'I always wondered what I would do if I was ever asked to cover my baby up to feed her, but I just stood there,' she said. 'I was so shocked, I just walked in and sat down, I didn't know what else to do.

'The waiter clearly did not think he had done anything wrong, he had no idea how awkward he made us feel. When we sat down I asked to speak to a manager but I think he thought I was joking. He did not bring a manager over.

'I did try to feed her covered over slightly, but it was so difficult because she was grabbing the cover and I couldn't see her latch on properly.

'I have complained to the restaurant but even if they apologise and allow me to breastfeed I don't think I will return.'

The restaurant's manager insisted that the premises does not have an anti-breastfeeding policy, saying that the waiter in question had made a mistake.

Martin Connolly said: 'I would like to start by wholeheartedly apologising to Miss Hiscox for any offence or distress we have caused her. The company has never had a policy that requires women to cover up whilst breastfeeding.Â 

'The member of staff in question has worked for the company for several months and I must take full responsibility for the fact that he had not been trained on the company policy regarding this issue. This has now been rectified and all staff are up to speed.

Shock: Ms Hiscox, 30, chose the restaurant because she had previously breastfed there with no problem

'I have strong personal views on the matter having two young daughters and a wife that regularly breastfed them both wherever and whenever required, and find the whole incident deeply regrettable.'

In December, a national row began when nursing mother Louise Burns was told she had to drape a napkin over herself while feeding her baby in Claridge's.

The controversy was fuelled by Ukip leader Nigel Farage, who said that mothers should 'sit in a corner' if they want to breastfeed in public.

The NHS says that new mothers 'shouldn't ever be made to feel uncomfortable about breastfeeding in public', and advises them not to retreat to the toilets for nursing.

It is illegal for businesses to ask women to leave while breastfeeding, under legislation brought in five years ago.
