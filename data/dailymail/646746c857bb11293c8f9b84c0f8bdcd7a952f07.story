You'd imagine playing a notorious Coronation Street baddie - and taking all the flak that comes with it - might put you off soap for life.

But seven years after his character, domestic abuser Charlie Stubbs, was bumped off, Bill Ward is back in soapland.

Bill's joined Emmerdale as respectable farmer James Barton and he's thrilled. 'When I started acting I played lots of upstanding, decent types - doctors, lawyers, soldiers - so it's great to be back in that territory. I like James because he has a strong moral compass, but his principles might slip - so he can get jealous or seek revenge. I'm enjoying that.'

Bill, 47, knows all about exploring the dark side of characters after three years playing Charlie - a serial cheat who kept girlfriend Shelley Unwin a virtual prisoner. He finally met his match in Tracy Barlow, who bashed his head in with a statue in 2007.

An ambassador for domestic violence charity Women's Aid - which he consulted over the role - Bill says, 'I loved playing Charlie because I got to be very rude and badly behaved. From an acting point of view Charlie was magnificent. He shocked me. Every week I'd get a script, shake my head and think, "He can't do that!"'

There've been shocks for his Emmerdale character too. James, who had a one-night stand with his late brother John's wife Moira Barton two decades ago, has discovered he's the father of her son Adam. Bill says, 'It's a nasty secret that's been bubbling away, and it'll soon explode into the open with devastating consequences for everyone.'

So how's Bill finding it back in the soap spotlight? 'The reaction I get now from fans compared to when I played Charlie is very different,' he says. 'Some people were horrified at what Charlie got up to, while others enjoyed the fact he went beyond what most normal, decent people would do. They congratulated me for making him so good to watch!

'James is more subdued, so now people say hello and chat about the show. I'm always touched when people come and talk to me, because it means your work's being watched and enjoyed. Long may it continue.'

Bill commutes to the Emmerdale set near Leeds from Bristol, where he lives with his partner and two young children. 'I'm shy and like to keep myself to myself, so when I'm not acting I'm miles away from that world.'

Bill, who once described himself as a 'jobbing actor', having come into the industry late following a successful career in advertising, is just happy to be in work. 'Making a living through acting is tough, and getting tougher,' he says, 'so I'm delighted whenever I get a new job because it means I'm working. As long as that continues I'll be happy.'

Holidays, active or lazy? They're always active - and cold. I've  done plenty of trekking in Iceland. There isn't a lot of lying around  on beaches for me these days!

Cinema or restaurant? I haven't watched a movie for ages. As my partner and I have kids, on a night out we'll have some food and chat.

Music , jazz or classical? I play clarinet in a jazz band and have done for 25 years, so I listen to a lot of jazz. And 'dad rock', I guess you'd call it!

Box sets, Breaking Bad or Mad Men? I love Mad Men; as a former advertising executive, I find it so accurate. The people who made it really did their research.

TV, sport or drama? I watch a lot of sport: football, rugby and cricket.
