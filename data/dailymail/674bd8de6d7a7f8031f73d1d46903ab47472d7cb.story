Injured Australian cricket captain Michael Clarke has been named in the 15-man squad for the World Cup and is confident he will be fit for the one-day tournament.

Clarke, who missed the final three Tests against India due to hamstring surgery, has been given until February 21 to prove his fitness for the one-day tournament.

Chief selector Rod March revealed he will replace Clarke if the 33-year-old is not ready for to go for the side's clash with Bangladesh in Brisbane.

'We have said that if Michael has not recovered by our second match of the tournament against Bangladesh ... we will replace him in the squad,' Marsh said.

'He understands that and is working tirelessly with medical staff to get back to fitness.'

Speaking at the squad announcement in Sydney on Sunday Clarke was positive he could make the deadline.

'I'll do the work. It won't be lack of work that doesn't get me there.

'I'm confident I'll be fit,' he said.

Marsh revealed any player not fully fit by February 21 will be omitted from the squad, with the chief selector wanting everything settled early in the group stage.

Marsh added it would be up to the team's medical staff to pass Clarke fit, but that he wanted the skipper bowling, fielding and running between the wickets.

'He knows what he's go to do, he's played enough cricket to know whether he's right to go,' Marsh said.

'We looked at the best batsmen in the country and Michael's certainly one of them.'

Clarke suggested he wasn't thinking about the deadline, saying: 'I'm focusing on my rehab.'

When asked if he was happy with the early cut-off date which falls nearly a month before the quarter-finals begin, the 33-year-old replied 'it's up to the selectors, they make the decision'.

Mitch Marsh, who missed recent Tests at the MCG and SCG due to a hamstring strain, was also named in a squad that contained few surprises.

George Bailey remains vice-captain of the one-day side and will lead Australia if Clarke fails to play in the tournament.

'George has done a fantastic job with the team ... he's an experienced campaigner,' Marsh said.

'I think he (Steve Smith) is pretty tired after captaining the Test side and will relish the fact he can just go out there and play cricket.'

Allrounders Marsh, Shane Watson and James Faulkner were all automatic selections, while Glenn Maxwell is likely to be given a chance to shine in Australia's XI.

Xavier Doherty was picked as the sole tweaker, with Maxwell expected to provide the side's spin in most games.

Mitchell Johnson, Pat Cummins, Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood will make up Australia's pace attack.

Brad Haddin will keep wickets, while David Warner and Aaron Finch will open the batting for the co-hosts.

Batsmen Steve Smith, in the form of his life after scoring 769 runs in the four-Test series against India, and Bailey round out the squad.

This year's tournament starts with Australia facing England at the MCG on February 14, with the final to be held at the same venue on March 29.

Australia, England and India will have a chance to tune up for the 50-over event in the upcoming tri-series, which begins in Sydney on Friday.
