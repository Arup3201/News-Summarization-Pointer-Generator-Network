In a tense standoff with an increasingly impatient White House press corps, President Obama's chief spokesman refused to answer a yes-or-no question about whether the president still has 'confidence' in Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki.

During a press briefing on May 19, Jay Carney stated flatly that 'the president has confidence in Secretary Shinseki.' But on Thursday he dodged a point-blank dare to repeat that endorsement.

And he calmly offered a contradictory set of guidelines about actions the VA and the White House should take in response to the brewing veterans' health care scandal.

YES OR NO? White House press secretary Jay Carney ducked and dodged questions about VA Secretary Eric Shinseki's job security, refusing to repeat assurances from ten days ago about President Obama's confidence in the decorated war hero

Hot seat: Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki presides over a VA system whose medical centers have let dozens of veterans die while they waited to see doctors for the first time

'This is very important,' Carney said just minutes into his briefing on Thursday. 'The VA should not and must not wait for the current investigation of VA operations to conclude before taking steps to improve care.'

But moments later he told reporters that President Obama will wait before taking action.

'The
 president identified last week that he expected a preliminary report 
from Secretary Shinseki's internal audit very soon,' instructed Carney. 'And once he receives
 that he'll be able to evaluate those findings along with what we're 
seen in the interim report from the inspector general, and then assess 
where we are at that time.'

Realistically, that could come by the end of the weekend, though – giving Obama 'a whole lot more facts,' Carney said, about the agency's internal corruption.

'We'll be very interested in the results,' Carney assured reporters.

On Wednesday the VA's inspector general released its own separate preliminary report showing that veterans in Phoenix, Arizona waited an average of 115 days for a first medical appointment, and that 1,700 of them were left off of waiting lists and denied care entirely.

About 40 veterans died while waiting to see doctors.

Toward the end of an hour-long rhetorical kabuki dance on Thursday, an ABC News reporter asked Carney 'a very simple yes-or-no question: Does the president have confidence in Secretary Shinseki?'

Carney dissembled and drew from a briefing book full of talking points.

'The 
president believes that – and is confident that Gen. Shinseki has served
 his nation admirably, heroically as a soldier, as a general, and that 
he has accomplished some very important things as secretary of veterans 
affairs,' he said.

'And I listed them, but they include extending education 
benefits, reducing veterans' homelessness, and reducing the backlog for 
disability claims while expanding vastly the number of veterans who can 
make a claim.'

Glutton for punishment: Carney (L) seen exiting Marine One with National Security Adviser Susan Rice (R), is Obama's dedicated spear-catcher -- and has been fielding tough questions as the VA scandal deepens

Tensions: Congressional Republicans verbally flayed a trio of VA officials Thursday night in a rare evening hearing on Capitol Hill. 'Veterans died!' the House VA Committee's chairman barked at one. 'Get us the answers!'

'FIRE HIM!': Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain has led a parade of four dozen members of Congress who are demanding Shinseki's ouster

'But does the president right now have confidence in Secretary Shinseki?' the reporter parried. 'Yes or no? It's a very simple yes-or-no question.'

Carney said he wouldn't 'improve on' Obama's words from a May 21 briefing, dismissing questions as 'wordplay.'

Obama, however, was never asked directly whether Shinseki's job was safe.

Carney began his regular briefing more than an hour after its originally scheduled starting time. Despite the VA scandal hanging in the air, he opened up with a soliloquy about nutrition.

Support for the secretary has eroded on Capitol Hill, with nearly 50 members of Congress calling for his ouster. Many are Democrats facing tough re-election battles in states where Republicans dominate the electorate.

White House press secretary balks at 'simple yes-or-no question'

@highlight

Ten days ago he told reporters that 'the president has confidence in Secretary Shinseki'

@highlight

But now the VA secretary is reportedly on 'probation' and Carney won't say Obama is prepared to keep him

@highlight

Carney also insisted that the VA 'should not and must not wait for the current investigation of VA operations to conclude' before fixing things

@highlight

But in the same breath, he said Obama will wait until two separate investigations are over before deciding what to do

@highlight

There's an outside chance the president could act this weekend after Shinseki delivers his internal report on the crisis to the White House
