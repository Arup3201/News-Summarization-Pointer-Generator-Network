A decorated New York policeman who gunned down his two daughters before turning the weapon on himself has reportedly left his wife and surviving child destitute.

Glen Hochman was claimed to have submitted retirement papers just weeks before the double murder suicide and deliberately not named an inheritor for his pension.

A family friend described it as a 'final insult,' according to the New York Post.

'It’s reckless and insulting for any man to leave their family high and dry like that, by choosing the zero option on their pension, the source reportedly told the newspaper.

Dead: Glen Hochman, 52, a police officer of 22 years who only retired in January, is believed to have murdered his two daughters Deanna Hochman, 13 (center) and Alissa Hochman, 17, on Saturday afternoon 

Family torn apart: Glen Hochman is seen here with with his wife Anamarie (back right), his two victims, daughters Alissa and Deanna (front) and eldest daughter Samantha (right). Anamarie and Samantha were not home at the time of the tragedy, police have confirmed

'...He effectively stole the future away from the family he left behind.'

The 52-year-old, who served White Plains for 22 years, executed his daughters, Alissa, 17, and Deanna, 13, along with three family dogs at their home in Harrison, about 20 miles outside Manhattan.

He then shot himself dead. 

His wife, Anamarie, 50,  and their eldest daughter, Samantha, were not at home at the time of the incident. 

At the time of the double murder suicide it was understood that Hochman and his wife were having marital problems.  

Harrison Police Chief Anthony Marraccini said officers visited the home after receiving reports of no answers at the door. 

Killed: Alissa Hochman, 17, a senior at Harrison High School, and Deanna Hochman, 13, were found dead, along with their father, on Saturday afternoon

Scene: Police arrived at this home at 1 Adelphi Avenue in the Westchester County village of Harrison on Saturday night to find Glen Hochman, 52, a former local cop, and his two teen daughters dead

Police dispatched to the scene made the grim discovery of the bodies and a six-page note penned by Hochman.

His body was found in the garage while those of Alissa and Deanna were found on 'the main level' of the house.

The family's thrree dogs had also been shot.

White Plains Police Commissioner David Chong released a statement  and called the deaths 'an unfathomable tragedy'.

Chong said the department were 'shocked and horrified by the news,' according to the Journal News

'We can only pray for the family,' he said.

Investigation: Police are trying to establish what drove Glen Hochman - seen here with his wife Anamarie - to murder his two daughters, before killing himself

'Officer Hochman served this department and the city of White Plains with honor and integrity for over 22 years.'

Last year, Hochman won the department's life-saving award for keeping an unresponsive man alive until paramedics arrived.  

Hochman suffered an Achilles' injury in early May when he fell while helping a disabled motorist, reports Lohud.

He had time off to recover according to his union lawyer, Warren Roth, who had known Hochman for more than 25 years, since both worked as EMTs with the Harrison ambulance corps.

He said Hochman sought a disability retirement because of the injury but had not been depressed over it as he was planning for retirement soon anyway  

'It's just devastating to a lot of people,' Roth said. 

'He was always a quiet, reserved guy, nothing ever seemed to unsettle him. ... And he was wonderful with his daughters, a devoted father. That's the scary part. There was absolutely no seeing this coming.'

Residents of the upper middle-class neighborhood discussed the shootings in quiet tones as they shoveled snow Sunday.

Howard Hollander, 52, an airline pilot who lives five doors down from the Hochmans, said Hochman 'was always taking care of the property, landscaping, cleaning up the yard.'

'The girls said hi whenever they passed,' Hollander said. 'I remember one was learning to drive and beeped at us as she went by.'

He added, 'There was no indication at all of any problem, that something like this would happen.'

Murder-suicide: Investigators worked through the night on Saturday inside the home

Victims: Deanna Hochman, 13 (left), and her sister Alissa Hochman, 17, a senior at Harrison High School, were murdered by their father on Saturday, police say

Another neighbor, Dante Garritano, 52, an engineer, said he went outside when he saw ambulances and police cars Saturday.

'I walked out and I heard a woman crying, screaming, on her phone, 'My God, they're dead. He killed himself,'' Garritano said.

In a statement on the Harrison school district's website, Superintendent of Schools Louis N. Wool said Alissa, a high school senior, and Deanna were 'both lost to incomprehensible tragedy.'

He said the response of the district community to past tragedies has been inspiring and that he expects the students and staff will be no less resilient this time.

'In this awful moment, let us remember how proud we are of (the high school community), how much they have helped others and how much they will help others again,' Wool said.

Harrison High School, opened its campus on Sunday for grief counseling.
