It's a year that Emily Helck won't soon forget.

At the age of 28, the Jersey City artist was diagnosed with breast cancer and shortly afterwards her chemotherapy began

Emily decided that she would keep a record of everything she was going to endure from the bald head, to a surgical bra, to the tiredness.

The journey begins here: Emily Helck decided to start a blog that would chart her year-long course of chemo

Fast-paced: To the viewer the year speeds by in exactly one minute. To Emily, it must have felt like forever...

Shades: The pictures capture the emotions, the ups and downs of Emily Helcks cancer treatment

One year on since she first began her treatment, Ms Helck gives a smile of achievement on a one minute long video that captures the past twelve months.

She decided that a video really was the only way to keep an accurate record of the year she had to endure.

'You forget things that are upsetting,’ she said. ‘Your brain protects you.’

‘Truthfully, I didn't think I would keep it up, because I'm terrible at stuff like that,’ she told NJ.com. 

She states on her blog that normally she doesn't like looking at photo's of herself, but taking pictures whilst she was undergoing treatment for cancer made her look at herself differently.

'I feel separate from this person somehow, even though the last photos are
from just a few days ago. I feel like the girl in the photos made it 
through pretty unscathed, though the look on her face sometimes makes me
sad. A lot of people had it a lot worse. It could always be 
worse.'

'My prognosis could be worse. I could have had to do harsher 
chemo. I could be going bankrupt. My dog could have run away. So yes, it
could always be worse. But it could be a lot better, too.'

The photos aren't elaborate setups. Sometimes she's still in her pajamas.

Viewers can also read her blog, The Real Tumours of New Jersey, which convey her dark moods as she endured a double mastectomy, reconstruction, chemotherapy and radiation.

In some of the pictures she doesn't look towards the camera and looks decidedly downbeat.

In a recent blog post, Emily tries to explain why she went ahead the the project.

'At first it had to do with documenting the hair saga. But it wound up becoming about something else, too. The photos became hash marks scratched on the wall, marking time spent inhabiting the world of this disease. Every time I set up the tripod was another week down.

One year on: My hope is that by showing what it looks like to go through treatment, I can shine a light on a little bit of that unknown

'My body continued to change drastically too. I kind of wear my heart on my sleeve, so what's going on emotionally is visible on my face. It became about how the process of cancer treatment affected my entire life.'

'It was not about looking good,' she says. Ms Helck took the videos for her self and put them all together in a timelapse video, and now more than 90,000 people have viewed her creation.

‘It's incredibly heart-warming,’ she says.

‘My hope is that by showing what it looks like to go through treatment, I can shine a light on a little bit of that unknown.’

Ms. Helck has now finished her treatment and says her health is good, although she's ‘still dealing with the reconstruction, which will go into next year.
