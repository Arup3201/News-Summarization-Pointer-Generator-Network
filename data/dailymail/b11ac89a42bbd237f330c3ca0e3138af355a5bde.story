If Saturday's Iowa Freedom Summit had an award for the 'most improved' presidential hopeful, Carly Fiorina would win hands-down: She was an unknown when she took the stage but became the talk of Des Moines after a speech that included plain-spoken attacks on likely Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.

The former Hewlett-Packard CEO entered to polite applausebut left to raucous cheers, as the thousand-plus conservatives gathered to hear from big political names on the right identified a woman they can rally behind.

Clinton, the former secretary of state, is expected to use her globetrotting experience as a prime qualification for winning the Oval Office – and Fiorina, it turns out, can match her.

'Like Hillary Clinton, I too have travelled hundreds of thousands of miles around the globe,' she said Saturday. 'But unlike her, I have actually accomplished something.'

'Mrs. Clinton, flying is an activity – not an accomplishment,' Fiorina exclaimed to applause.

ANTIDOTE TO HILLARY CLINTON? Former H-P CEO Carly Fiorina made a name for herself Saturday in Iowa by targeting the former secretary of state head-on

'Flying is an activity, not an accomplishment,' Fiorina jabbed, winning huge applause from conservative partisans

IN YOUR FACE: Fiorina made headlines last week for confronting White House adviser Valerie Jarrett over the Obama administration's record of paying female employees less than men

'What difference, at this point, does it make?' Clinton famously snapped in a 2013 Senate hearing when confronted with the tall tale that an anti-Islam YouTube video, not a terror plot, sparked the death and destruction in Sept. 11, 2012

'I have met Vladimir Putin and know that it will take more to halt his ambitions than a gimmicky red "reset" button. Having done business in over 80 countries and having served as the Chairman of the External Advisory Board at the CIA, I know that China is a state-sponsor of cyberwarfare and has a strategy to steal our intellectual property.'

The 'reset button' episode was one of Clinton's early embarrassments at the State Department. 

In 2009 she appeared in Geneva, Swltzerland with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and famously presented him with a prop red button labeled 'reset' in English and 'peregruzka' in Russian. 

'We want to reset our relationship, and so we will do it together,' she said then. 

But the Russian word was misspelled – it should have read 'perezagruzka.' 

Instead, a stick-on label used the word meaning 'overcharged.'

The embarrassing moment is one of many that Republicans will likely turn into television ads if Clinton continues to lead the Democratic field going into 2016. 

Fiorina also jabbed Clinton over the Obama administration's patience with Iran as it resists attempts to dismantle its nuclear program.

'I know Bibi Netanyahu,' she said, using the Israeli Prime Minister's familiar nickname, 'and know that when he warns us, over and over and over again, that Iran is a danger to this nation as well as to his own, that we must listen.'

And in a coup de grace, Fiorina hammered Hillary for her now infamous meltown moment during January, 2013 testimony before a Senate panel about the terror attack in Benghazi, Libya four months earlier.

'RESET': Fiorina took aim at Hillary Clinton and the 'reset' button she infamously gave Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in 2009

DOES THE STATE DEPT. HAVE TRANSLATORS? Instead of reading 'perezagruzka' – the Russian word for 'reset' – a stick-on label used the word 'peregruzka' was used, which actually meant 'overcharged'

Faced with pre-election national outrage over a coordinated military-stye assault on an American diplomatic compound and the death of U.S. Ambassdor to Libya Christopher Stevens, the Obama administration had blamed his death and three others on a spontaneous protest supposedly inspired by an anti-Islam YouTube video.

'The fact is, we had four dead Americans,' Clinton exploded during a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing. 'Was it because of a protest or because of guys out for a walk one night who decide to kill some Americans? What difference, at this point, does it make?'

Fiorina brought the episode back from her audience's mental archives. 

'Unlike Hillary Clinton I know what difference it makes that our Ambassador to Libya and three other brave Americans were killed in a deliberate terrorist attack on the anniversary of 9/11,' she said, 'and that the response of our nation must be more forceful that the arrest of a single individual a year later.'

The line brought the house down.

Fiorina is no political neophyte – she ran unsuccessfully against California Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer in 2012. But outside California, she didn't sink into Americans' political consciousness.

That will likely change if her Des Moines ovations are a fair prediction. 

Will Rogers, the local Republican Party chairman in Polk County, Iowa, told Daily Mail Online that Fiorina could become a breakout star in the early going.

'People need to take her very seriously,' he said. 

Maxwell claims State Department higher-ups close to then-Secretary Hillary Clinton worked over a weekend to scrub boxes of documents of anything that might make her look bad, before giving them to investigators

Fiorina will be back in Iowa in mid-March to speak at a 'women in politics' event.

'I've seen her on Meet The Press. I've seen her on Bill Maher's show ... she's great,' Rogers said in an interview.

Fiornia 'doesn't just come on and bash the – you know, it's like, "Here's all the problems" – she actually is offering solutions.'

'Carly doesn't need to come in and give the razzle dazzle,' Rogers said. 'But she had some good one-liners about Hillary. And she's fair game.'

Former Oklahoma GOP Chairman Gary Jones was equally impressed, telling The Washington Times that FIorin, 'whom most people had never heard of, got the best response.'

'She came across as a highly intelligent woman and a strong leader as the ex-chief executive of the biggest tech firm in the world. She did herself the most good.'

The Freeom Summit featured a parade of conservative luminaries including Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, former vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, pediatric neurosurgeon Dr. Ben Carson and real estate tycoon Donald Trump.
