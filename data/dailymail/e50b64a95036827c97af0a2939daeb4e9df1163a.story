Wilfried Zaha has been getting in the festive spirit as Crystal Palace prepare for the busy Christmas and New Year fixture pile-up.

The on-loan Manchester United winger posed for a picture donning a Christmas jumper and an unusual hat on Tuesday.

The tricky wide man took to his Instagram account to share the festive snap and encouraged his 208,000 followers to enjoy the season of goodwill.

'Merry Christmas to everyone from me and my top hat,' the 22-year-old wrote.

Zaha is currently on a season-long loan at Crystal Palace after being deemed surplus to requirements this campaign by United boss Louis van Gaal.

After earning a big-money move to United during Alex Ferguson's final season at the club, Zaha has struggled to make an impact, firstly under David Moyes and now Van Gaal.

Zaha has only started six Premier League games for Neil Warnock's side this season, in what is his second spell at the south London club.

Crystal Palace welcome Southampton to Selhurst Park on Boxing Day before crucial away trips to QPR on Sunday and Aston Villa on New Year's Day.
