Shot: Mother-of-one Sabrina Moss died in a hail of bullets in Kilburn High Road on August 24 last year as she celebrated her 24th birthday

A nursery teacher was shot dead by masked gunmen who wanted to send out a message they were not to be messed with, a court heard today.

Mother-of-one Sabrina Moss died in a hail of bullets in Kilburn High Road, north west London, as she celebrated her 24th birthday in the early hours of August 24 last year.

Her friend Sabrina Gachette, 24, and two other men, Mahad Ahmed and Edson Da Silva, were also injured during the shooting. 

The alleged killers are said to have armed themselves with a MAC-10 sub-machine gun and a sawn-off shotgun.

Martell Warren, 22, Hassan Hussain, 29, and Yassin James, 19, are on trial for murder and attempted murder at the Old Bailey. 

All three deny shooting Moss and her friends.

A fourth man, Simon Baptiste, 29, is also accused of involvement in the attack.

Miss Moss, who lived in Neasden, north west London and worked at Alice’s Wonderland nursery in Stonebridge, had a four-year-old son. 

She died after suffering a gunshot wound to the chest.

Members of the victim’s family were in court as the details of her final moments were described. 

Prosecutor Mark Heywood QC said: ‘The August bank holiday 2013 last year will live forever in the memory of some and that’s exactly by design.

‘The design of these defendants - those who committed the crimes at the heart of this case. 

‘What they did was intended to send a message to those in their world that they were not to be trifled with or angered. 

‘In the early hours of that Saturday of that weekend about an hour before dawn a planned attack was executed across one of the capital’s high roads to the north.

‘On one side of the road during the last minutes of a night out was a young mother partying with friends. 

‘They were laughing, chatting and some were standing smoking on the pavements. 

‘On the other side of the road were men with hoods over their heads, likely in gloves, faces covered - two killers. 

‘Behind them a car facing the wrong way up a one-way street, in that was a man who wanted it done just as much as they - ready to speed them away.

‘They had selected their weapons not just because they fell to hand, each one designed to kill or maim at close quarters.

‘One a double-barreled weapon originally made for sport - now sawn-off and turned into a lethal weapon against humans specifically loaded with heavy shot. 

‘The other a rapid fire machine gun, a Mac-10 designed to kill at short range. 

‘This kind of weapon was invented for war and is so hard to come by it had been converted from a blank fire piece so as to be effective. 

‘They, those people, had carried out surveillance of their targets and knew very well who their targets were and where they were.’

He added: ‘They ran out and fired at point blank range in a way that was as vicious as it was cowardly.’

Warren, Hussain and James deny murder, three counts of attempted murder, two counts of possessing a firearm with intent to endanger life and two counts of conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm.

Baptiste is also charged with conspiring to cause grievous bodily harm. 

Mr Heywood said the killers unleashed ‘both barrels of the shotgun and two or three bursts of the machine gun so that when the noise and smoke drifted away two young women lay upon the pavement injured’. 

‘One woman survived after deeply invasive surgery,’ he added.

‘The other couldn’t be saved even by that. 

‘Two of the men were also hit.’

Mr Heywood described the murder as completely unjustified. 

‘No one is likely to say that the killing of Sabrina Moss is not murder,’ he said. 

‘There is and can be no justification for her murder. 

‘No one will suggest that by shooting at the group as a whole and injuring those people who were shot the people responsible did not do so other than trying to kill them. 

‘The sole question is whether the defendants joined in that attempt. 

‘Are these defendants responsible for this?’

Miss Moss had been celebrating her birthday with a number of friends at Love and Liquor club in Kilburn. 

‘She had a great many friends, a number of who were with her that night helping her celebrate,’ Mr Heywood said. 

The shootings were the tragic result of an ongoing violent dispute between the alleged killers and a group from South Kilburn, Mr Heywood told the jury. 

‘The reason for that is not clear but it was serious, it was deep-seated - so deep-seated that it was enough to occupy their activities for most of that night,’ he continued. 

The accused murderers stalked their intended victims all night before launching the deadly attack, the court heard. 

Baptiste is said to have let the alleged gunmen use his house as a base for the killing. 

Warren, of Kensal Green, north west London; Hussain, of Cranhurst Road, Willesden Green, north west London; and James, of Wembley, north west London, deny murder, three counts of attempted murder, two counts of possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life, and conspiring to commit grievous bodily harm.

Baptiste, of Cricklewood, in north west London, denies conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm.

The trial continues.
