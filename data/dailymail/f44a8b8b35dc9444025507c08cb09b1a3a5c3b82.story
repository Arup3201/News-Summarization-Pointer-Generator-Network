A vigilante who put a man in a choke hold without warning from behind when he saw him enter a Florida Wal-Mart with a concealed firearm has been charged with battery.

Michael Foster, who is white, decided to take the law into his own hands on Tuesday morning and launched himself on Clarence Daniels, who is black, fearing a shooting.

Foster, 43, was helped by other shoppers in the Brandon store, but when sheriff's arrived they discovered that 62-year-old Daniels possessed a permit for his gun and arrested the would-be hero.

According to deputies, Foster told them that when he saw Daniels get out his car he caught sight of a gun under his coat, in a holster.

Foster followed Daniels into the Wal-Mart, but did not call 911 before he attacked Daniels nor did he alert security.

Indeed, during the brief struggle, which caught Daniels completely by surprise, he screamed out that he was licensed to carry a firearm, but Foster ignored that and told him to wait for the sheriff's to arrive to decide.

Three other men helped Foster to hold Daniels down until law enforcement arrived, despite his pleas to let him go.

When Hillsborough sheriff's arrived and separated the men and discovered the cause of the melee they promptly arrested Foster on a charge of battery.

Video of the incident shows the shocking moment that Foster strikes and puts Daniels into a choke hold without any warning.

Women and children scatter as Foster yells out that Daniels has a gun.

One witness, spoke to Fox News said that he was shocked by the incident and worried what could have happened.

'He doesn't even know who the victim is,' said Manton Sameuls. 'But he just goes and attacks the man and throws him to the ground, necklock him, for what? Why? What did the man do?'
