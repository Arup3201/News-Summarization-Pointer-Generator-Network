A man has been arrested on suspicion of murder after a college lecturer and children’s author was found dead at her home.

The body of Julie Semper, a business studies tutor at a sixth form college, was found by a neighbour in her Victorian flat in an upmarket suburb.

The neighbour, Nicky Noyes, yesterday said Miss Semper, 47, had recently separated from her boyfriend.

She said: 'I don’t want to go in to details, but I saw Julie lying on the floor. She wasn’t moving so I called the police. I don’t want to say if there were any signs of how she died.

'Julie lived on her own. She was a lovely, lovely person. We had only known each other for a few months but we had become good friends.

'She was very happy in her job at the college and often spoke about how well her students were doing.

'She had a grown-up daughter but I had never met her.'

Miss Noyes confirmed her neighbour had been in a relationship but said they ‘broke up a while ago’.

Police were today carrying out forensic examinations at the cordoned-off £200,000 flat in Mapperley Park, Nottingham, where Ms Semper is thought to have lived alone. Her neighbours included the £5m Nottingham Forest footballer Britt Assombalonga.

Ms Semper, who described herself as having an interest in reading about 'true life crime and particularly serial killers' on a writers’ website, had published a Harry Potter-style book on Amazon called 'Emily Moon and the Fire Demon', which featured a schoolgirl whose parents were possessed by demons.

The lecturer taught business at Bilborough College in Nottingham, since September. The sixth form college regularly sends students to Oxford and Cambridge Universities.

Nottinghamshire Police said a 24-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder at another location on Thursday. He remained in custody yesterday.

Chris Bradford, principle of 1,800 Bilborough College - which is rated ‘good’ by Ofsted - said Miss Semper was a ‘valued member of our cover team and we were extremely saddened to hear what had happened.’

Miss Semper, who does not appear to have married, lived in her flat for about 18 months. The large Victorian building is currently undergoing a luxury make-over.

She had previously lived at another flat on the same road.

A neighbour there, Linda Gibson, a social sciences lecturer at Nottingham Trent University, said: ‘This is so very sad, very tragic. Julie was very chatty and bubbly.

‘We got on because we were both in the teaching profession. She moved from here about 18 months ago and didn’t really keep in touch.’ Another neighbour said: ‘She was a good neighbour. The only time you heard any noise is when she played her piano.’

In her profile on writers’ website Authonomy, Ms Semper wrote: ‘I am a project manager and business tutor.

‘In my spare time I write gothic fantasy literature, TV and film scripts as well as plays. I enjoy reading true life crime particularly about serial killers as well as dark and white magic books.

‘I am a film addict and will watch anything from sci-fi to rom-com. I first started writing during a screenwriters course where I wrote a script called Lilith about a female vampire and received very positive feedback from writers and directors that I kept on writing.

‘In my spare time I practice clairvoyancy, healing, and house clearing (exorcisms).’

Miss Semper was also thought to have run her own holistic therapy business. A second online profile described her as a ‘qualified Reiki master’ who also performed past life regression.

A Nottinghamshire Police spokesman said a 24-year-old man had been arrested and was being questioned in connection with the death.
