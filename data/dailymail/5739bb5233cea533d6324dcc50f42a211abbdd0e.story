A British performer who penned a book about his experience of sexual abuse has been temporarily banned from publishing it because his ex-wife is worried their young son will read it.

In a case which has been shrouded in secrecy, the woman, known only as BHM, successfully obtained an injunction to stop her ex-husband, known as MLA, publishing the book until the issue has been decided at trial.

Media lawyers and publishers have warned the case - known only as OPO v MLA -  could set a dangerous precedent for freedom of expression and fear it could extend privacy laws 'by the back door'.

A British performer who wrote about his experience of sexual abuse has been stopped from publishing his book after his wife sought an injunction from the Court of Appeal,

The artist - said to be well-known in his performing arts field - argued that his right to freedom of expression was palpable because he had been the victim of such serious abuse as a schoolboy.

But lawyers for his ex-wife claimed their son was particularly vulnerable and would be hugely disturbed if he ever read parts of his father's work.

In a further twist, the veil of secrecy covering the case means those involved can only be known by their initials. The artist's exact trade cannot be revealed either.

The court even went to lengths to describe the woman and her son as living in 'Ruritania' in order to conceal her identity.

The performer told the Guardian: 'Imagine someone from Rotherham being told they can't come forward and talk about what happened to them as a result of legal action.' 

The startling case emerged after BHM brought proceedings on behalf of her son, who has Asperger's Syndrome and attention deficit disorder.

Experts warn the case could have a devastating effect on freedom of expression for writers 

The case was brought to court under a historic case dating back to 1897 which established 'the intentional infliction of mental shock' in common law.

The court rejected BHM's claims that the information would be a 'misuse of private information' or that the whole book should be banned.

But it did grant a temporary injunction, ruling that the balance of the boy's rights versus those of his father should be decided at full trial.

MLA's solicitor Tamsin Allen told the paper that the decision threatened to extend privacy law by the back door, adding that there could be 'serious implications'.

And Jo Glanville, director of English PEN, which campaigns for the rights of writers, told MailOnline: 'I think it is always worrying when a book is potentially banned.

'We have to question very carefully the basis on which this is taking place. We do not expect this to happen in a democracy that has a very fundamental support for freedom of speech.'

She added that it could be a slippery slope, allowing others to claim they are 'distressed' by other people's work.

She said: 'If it is possible for an individual to stop a book being published, on the grounds it will cause distress to a family relative, you can imagine that it might be applied further to many other cases - particularly memoirs, or even fiction that might be based on real events and in which people can identify themselves. 

'It is incredibly rare for books to be banned. But what I can see as potentially happening is very worrying. When it happens we really have to examine and questions and resist.'

Jodie Ginsberg, chief executive of the campaign group Index on Censorship, said: 'What would concern us is the potential for this to be used by other people as a way of getting books censored on the grounds that it causes distress.

'I think that leads a very wide area for interpretation.'

She added that attempting to ban something from publication over the fear it could become readily-available on the internet also sets a dangerous precedent. 

The 'intentional infliction of mental distress' was established in a famous English tort case called Wilkinson V Downton.

Thomas Wilkinson was the landlord of the Albion public house in Limehouse. A regular customer of the public house, known as Mr Downton, decided to play a practical joke on Wilkinson's wife.

When Mr Wilkinson went to see the races in Harlow, he left his wife to manage the house. Mr Downton approached Mrs Wilkinson and told her that her husband had been seriously injured in an accident - which was not true. 

Mr Downton told Mrs Wilkinson that he had suffered two broken legs and that he was lying at The Elms in Leytonstone. He told her that she should go to him and bring two pillows to carry him home.

Mrs Wilkinson argued that the joke was a shock to her nervous system, causing her to vomit and her hair to turn white.  Mrs Wilkinson successfully sued.  

The most famous example of a book threatening to be banned was in the case of Spycatcher.

In 1988, the British Government lost its long-running battle to stop the publication of the controversial book which was written by former secret service agent, Peter Wright. 

The court ruled the media could publish extracts from the former MI5 officer's memoirs, because any damage to national security had already been done by its publication abroad.
