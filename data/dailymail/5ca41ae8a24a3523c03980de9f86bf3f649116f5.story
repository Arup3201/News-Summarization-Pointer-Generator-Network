A chatty young man called Ross ('I'm working here until my girlfriend finishes uni, then we're off travelling') is blowing frantically on the embers of a failing fire.

He breaks off to show us our ground floor room at this handsome (Grade 2-listed) pub on the River Kennet, across the tracks from Kintbury railway station.

The author Robert Harris lives 100 yards upstream, and Hungerford is a couple of miles further along the towpath in this leafy stretch of West Berkshire.

Simply glorious: The Dundas Arms enjoys a remarkable setting on the banks of the River Kennet

We are only paying £100 B&B but, even so, it's a dull room - a box, with brown furniture and dated curtains. Its one redeeming feature is a little fenced-off patio leading directly on to the canal at the back of the building.

There is no middle ground in the bathroom, where the basin taps either trickle lifelessly or gush with such force that they give you a proper soaking - just where you don't want it.

But what we like about the Dundas Arms is how it's popular with locals, and the staff are all in the mould of Ross - welcoming, efficient, down to earth.

We are particularly impressed by a German girl who tells us she has been in the UK for 11 years - which explains her flawless English.

A friend who lives nearby joins us for dinner.

Ross explains that there is no head chef as such - 'we're using agency ones at the moment' - and it shows. My game pie is an unsightly mess and doesn't taste of much, while my wife has a rubbery steak. Our friend does better with her venison.

But prices (wine is particularly reasonable) are good for this part of the world.

A labrador strolls in for some respite from the cold. He seems to like the atmosphere, and might even be impressed by the bar decorated in polished old penny pieces minted in 1967 and by the wonderful array of real ales, including Berkshire Good Old Boy and Ramsbury Gold.

Yes, the dining room needs some love.

But what a spot this must be once winter is over, when Ross won't have to act as human bellows, and when sitting by the river will be a glorious summer treat.

The restaurant is popular with the locals - although the food is uninspiring
