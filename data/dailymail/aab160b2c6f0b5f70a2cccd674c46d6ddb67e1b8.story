Pledge: David Cameron has previously said he would introduce a charge to halt the rise in plastic bag use but has so far failed to act

David Cameron was under mounting pressure to curb the use of plastic bags in England last night as Northern Ireland became the latest part of the UK to introduce charging.

The Prime Minister pledged two years ago to take action to halt the ‘unacceptable’ rise in plastic bag use, but has so far failed to act.

The pressure on Mr Cameron to meet his pledge was ramped up further last night as supermarket giant Waitrose indicated it backed charging for bags.

At least one of the ‘big four’ supermarkets has also told the Daily Mail it supports the proposal and argues it is time for the Government to bring in a compulsory scheme.

Leading clean-up campaigners have blasted the Prime Minister and called for the introduction of a charge that would both remove billions of bags and raise money for good causes.

Some six billion bags were handed out at tills by major stores in England alone last year, a figure that has risen for two years in a row. Wales introduced a 5p charge with all-party support in October 2011, which led to a reduction of some 90 per cent in the number given out at tills.

Northern Ireland introduced a 5p levy yesterday and the Scottish government is expected to follow suit next year. The ruling SNP has a manifesto commitment to ‘seek to phase out free plastic bags in supermarkets’.

That leaves only England where the Westminster government has failed to act, despite repeated promises from both Mr Cameron and Nick Clegg.

Julian Kirby, of Friends of the Earth, said: ‘The levy in Northern Ireland will make a huge amount of difference to the amount of harmful plastic bags in trees, eaten by animals and blown into our seas.

‘England is not only behind Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland but behind states in the US and other countries in Europe who have done this.’

Leaders from Keep Britain Tidy, the Campaign to Protect Rural England, the Marine Conservation Society and Surfers Against Sewage met Environment Minister Lord de Mauley last week. However, they were given the brush off when he promised no action beyond monitoring how schemes work in Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland.

The coalition of green groups wants England to join the rest of the UK and introduce a 5p charge by the end of next year.

Block: The move to introduce a charge is reportedly being stopped by Owen Paterson, pictured, and Chancellor George Osborne

Spokesman Dr Sue Kinsey said: ‘The Department for the Environment, Farming and Rural Affairs appears to be saying that the people couldn’t afford a charge or retailers wouldn’t cope – but we know from the Welsh experience this just isn’t true.’ Two of Britain’s cheapest and fastest growing supermarket chains are Aldi and Lidl, both of which charge customers for bags.

Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Asda, Morrisons, Waitrose, Boots and WH Smith have coped with the 5p bag charge in Wales without any drama. Waitrose makes clear to shoppers on its website that it fully supports the 5p charge introduced in Wales, saying the legislation fits with its philosophy to cut down on waste and litter.

A spokesman, however, declined to say when it would like a 5p charge to be introduced in England.

Retailers are reluctant to introduce a fee on a voluntary basis, fearing it will give rivals a commercial edge. Consequently, they want a national scheme.

Many Conservative MPs and councillors support charging as do the Lib Dems and Labour. However the measure is apparently being blocked by Chancellor George Osborne and Environment Secretary Owen Paterson because of fears about the impact on the cost of living.

Marks & Spencer has led the way on bag charging. It introduced a 5p fee in 2008 at the same time as the Daily Mail launched its Banish the Bags campaign. Since then, it has cut the number of bags issued by 78 per cent and raised more than £4million for charity.

A Defra spokesperson said: 'We want to work with retailers to help them lift their game to cut the number of bags they hand out.

'We are monitoring the results of the charging scheme in Wales and the outcome of the Scottish consultation on a charge so that we can make a fully informed decision.'
