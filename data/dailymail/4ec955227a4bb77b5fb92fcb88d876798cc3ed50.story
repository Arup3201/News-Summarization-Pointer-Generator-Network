The year's first colchicums bring a blend of joy and sadness. Joy because the mauve-pink flowers are so fresh and beautiful; sadness because their arrival marks the beginning of summer's demise.

Colchicums look like crocuses, but they buck the trend by flowering now instead of in spring. You often see them popping up, fresh and bedewed, in country churchyards or old cottage gardens.

Other gorgeous autumn bulbs include Nerines — brilliant for flower arrangements — bright pink Amaryllis belladonna and such little gems as yellow Sternbergia or pink-flushed white Acis. There are true crocuses for October, too, and even a pre-Christmas snowdrop.

Colchicum autumnale naturalises happily in grass and likes full sunshine. Buy them now as dry bulbs and expect fresh blooms within days.

Some of these flower while the bulbs are semi-dormant. So you can buy them now as dry bulbs and expect fresh blooms within days.

Plant them carefully, though, lest you snap off any tender buds. These lie just beneath the bulb's skin.

LEAFY AFTERMATH

Colchicums have a serious downside. They may resemble crocuses but, unlike them, they produce enormous shucks of untidy leaves in late spring. Bear that in mind if you plant them at a border front.

The easiest to grow, Colchicum autumnale, is good for naturalising in grass, preferably in full sun. Like daffodils, it does best in ground that doesn't dry out too much. Biggerflowered crocus speciosus performs better in a well-lit border, and both species have white varieties as well as rosy purple.

I rather like the big leaves, even when they tower above cowslips and daisies in our little spring meadow. But if they're not to your taste, choose true autumn crocuses instead. These, like their springblooming cousins, have sparse grassy leaves.

Crocus speciosus — easiest and prettiest — comes later than most colchicums, and has purple flowers with orange stigmas and subtle striping. In groups, they look spectacular, but prefer soil to turf.

Likewise, Acis autumnalis, the autumn snowflake. The tiny pinktinged white flowers look charming in big numbers. The grassy leaves which follow are discreet.

None of these plants can equal the splendour of the nerine, undisputed queen of the autumn bulbs. The hardiest, Nerine bowdenii, produces long stems topped with startling pink flowers whose petals curl elegantly. They last well in water, and the bulbs, if happy, grow steadily.

If the fluorescent pink of N. bowdenii is too strident for you, try the paler flowered Stefanie.

FLIGHTS OF FANCY

I alsogrow Zeal Giant, a large loud hybrid with satiny pink flowers. It's survived horrible winters in my Lincolnshire garden.

If you live in a mild area (Cornwall, say, or south-west Scotland) you could try the more fancy nerines. These are developed from the non-hardy Nerine sarniensis and come in hotter, more exciting colours. I've tried one called Codora which has vibrant red blooms but succumbed to slug attack and then got frozen through.

But if I had a roomy conservatory, I'd keep pots of fancy nerines outdoors from May to October and bring them inside for a late autumn bonanza. The colours of some are extraordinary — purple or even grey overlying crimson or pink.

Unlike most bulbs, nerines flower best when planted shallow, in overcrowded conditions and baked in summer sun. If left undisturbed for years, these get so crammed together that some are squeezed out. Re-plant the expelled bulbs in a new spot.

Nerine bowdenii loves a sunny border. The most prolific display I've ever seen was in a modest front garden near the sea, in Norfolk. The soil there was sandy — an extension of the beach, almost — but the nerines behaved as though they were at home in South Africa's muggy Eastern Cape.

Flowering from September through to November, Crocus speciosus Conqueror grows 10cm tall. The cheerful, violet blue flowers will multiply year after year (6/7 cm corms supplied).
