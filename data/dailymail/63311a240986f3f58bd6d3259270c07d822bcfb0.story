A ring of steel is being erected in London this afternoon in preparation for Margaret Thatcher's funeral.

Hordes of workers are putting up metal railings along the funeral route, while TV equipment is being rigged up at St Paul's Cathedral.

Wednesday's ceremonial funeral is expected to see the biggest security operation in London since last year's Olympics.

Operation True Blue, planned years before Baroness Thatcher's death, will involve the armed forces and an SAS contingent, as security forces take into account all threats, including those from Islamic militants, Irish republican terrorists and left-wing anarchists.

The preparations began as police made their presence felt at Trafalgar Square this afternoon, in preparation for an influx of protesters planning to hold a 'party' in celebration at Baroness Thatcher's death.

Soldiers will line the funeral route, which will wind its way from Westminster to St Paul's via Whitehall, The Strand, Fleet Street and Ludgate Hill.

The SAS are to set to be based within easy reach and its Special Boat Service counterparts will be afloat on the nearby River Thames.

More than 2,000 people will attend the Â£8million service, including The Queen and all surviving ex-prime ministers and US presidents, which is also a factor in the heightened security.

Other notable attendees will include Sir Terry Wogan, Joan Collins and Jeremy Clarkson.
