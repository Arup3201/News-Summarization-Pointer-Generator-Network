Manuel Pellegrini is targeting another Wembley berth with Manchester City after leading his side to the Capital One Cup trophy last weekend. 

City beat Sunderland 3-1 in London thanks to stunning goals from Yaya Toure, Samir Nasri and a breakaway finish from Jesus Navas. 

Pellegrini was staggered by the atmosphere inside the ground, considering both teams had hundreds of miles to travel to reach the home of football.

'It was our first chance to win a title this year,' Pellegrini told City TV in an exclusive interview. 

'It was very important for all the supporters, for the club, for the manager, for the staff, for the players, to win that cup because we deserved it.

'We played six games, we won the six, we scored 22 goals and just conceded two goals.

'It's difficult to believe, playing in Wembley, two teams and none of them are from London.

'Sunderland are in the north and we are in the centre, but you can have the possibility to have the full capacity and have Wembley full.

'Both teams must be proud of their supporters. They had at least 35,000 supporters each.'

Hopeful: Fernandinho could make the Brazil World Cup squad after some stellar performances this season

When asked how he celebrated his first trophy in England, Pellegrini said: 'Part of my family was in Wembley, part of my family is living here in Manchester with me. 

'I was very happy to celebrate that title in London.'

Pellegrini and his star-studded squad were training at the Etihad on Saturday morning ahead of their FA Cup clash with Wigan on Sunday.

Fernandinho, who returned to the Brazil squad for the first time in two years in midweek, was delighted with his performance for his country, which was capped by a stunning long-range goal.

'I feel very happy after two years to be back in the Brazil squad and to score a goal, for me, it was an amazing night,' the 29-year-old midfielder said.

'I took the ball in the middle and shot from maybe 30 yards. For me it was a very important goal and a beautiful goal.'

Luiz Felipe Scolari has a big decision to make when it comes to selecting his Brazil midfield for the World Cup, and Fernandinho remains optimistic his form can earn him a place in the hosts' squad this summer.

'He (Scolari) congratulated me, not just for the goal but for the overall performance,' he said.

'I think we played well but now we need to wait for the final sheet for the World Cup.'
