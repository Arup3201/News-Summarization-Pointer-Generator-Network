Twenty four years ago last weekend, Chris Eubank ensured his place in British boxing history by winning a gruelling war with Nigel Benn for the world middleweight title.

He would go on to win the same WBO belt at super-middleweight and enjoy a thrilling but devastating rivalry with Michael Watson as well as a drawn rematch with Benn.

A quarter of a century later however, it is the turn of his son, Chris Jnr to carry the family name into the ring.

The video begins with Chris Eubank Jnr in training before arriving out to fight as his father narrates 

'There comes a time in every fighter's career when he must risk everything,' says Eubank Snr in the video 

Eubank Sr continues: 'To pursue a dream. For you, that time is now'

On Saturday night, he takes on the reigning British, Commonwealth and European middleweight champion Billy Joe Saunders in front of more than 18,000 fans at the Excel Centre in London.

And to commemorate the occasion, creative agency Dunlop Goodrich have released a thrilling promotional video.

Voiced over a montage of Chris Jnr training and fighting, his father says: 'There comes a time in every fighter's career when he must risk everything to pursue a dream.

Eubank Jnr and Saunders looks set to overshadow the main event between Tyson Fury and Dereck Chisora

'For you, that time is now.'

Eubank has won all 18 of his professional fights against mediocre opposition and faces a significant step up against Saunders.

And although Saturday's show is headlined by Tyson Fury's heavyweight rematch with Dereck Chisora, it is Eubank's fight that has captured the imagination.

He came face to face with his opponent at the weigh in on Friday with their intense stare off lasting several minutes.

Eubank Snr has been quick to hype his son, claiming he will eventually be better than Floyd Mayweather Jnr.

And he signs off the video with the spine-tingling message: 'I gave you your name, son. Now, write it into history again.'
