Ukraine's parliament erupted into a brawl yesterday after a decision to send more reserve soldiers to battle separatists near the Russian border was approved.

Nationalist and pro-Russian lawmakers were seen swinging at, and wrestling one another, in scenes more fitting of a bar room brawl than a debating chamber. 

Members of the nationalist Svoboda (Freedom) party and politicians from the Party of Regions clashed after 232 deputies voted in favour of the decision - an extension of an earlier plan that had expired.

Fighting continues in the separatist-controlled Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine. In the nearby Lukansk region, the national military has reportedly made some gains against pro-Russian militants, the Moscow Times reported.

This is not the first time fists have flown in the Ukranian parliament. In April, a fight broke out after communist leader Petro Symonenko accused nationalists of having surrendered the country to Russia.

The fights come as tensions continue over the handling of last Thursday's MH17 crisis which claimed 298 lives - including 10 Britons.

While the first bodies of those killed in the crash arrived in the Netherlands today, there was fresh anguish amongst grieving relatives as it emerged that as many as a third of the passengers could still be missing.

Yesterday, 200 bodies were released by the rebels and taken by train to the Ukrainian government-controlled city of Kharkiv, raising questions about the condition of the remaining 98.

Rebel commanders claimed the makeshift morgue contained 282 bodies and 87 body parts from an additional 16 people.

This would have accounted for all of the passengers killed when the Boeing 777 was shot down by an anti-aircraft missile, however, after carrying out a body count last night, Dutch forensic experts found the number to be ‘significantly less’.

The head of the Dutch team leading the investigation, Jain Tuinder, said he estimated just 200 bodies had arrived in Kharkiv as well as a number of unidentified body parts.

Dutch air safety officials leading the investigation into the disaster also said today that they still had not got safe access to the crash site in eastern Ukraine.
