Woody Allen will write and direct an exclusive series for Amazon, the company has announced.

The half-hour series, known only as 'the Untitled Woody Allen Project' so far, will be available on Prime Instant Video in the U.S., U.K. and Germany next year, Amazon announced on Tuesday. 

'I don't know how I got into this,' Allen said in a wry statement. 'I have no ideas and I'm not sure where to begin. My guess is that Roy Price will regret this.'

But Roy Price, the vice president of Amazon Studios, expressed his excitement at the partnership.

New project: Woody Allen, pictured in 2013, will write and direct a series for Amazon that will premiere next year, the company announced on Tuesday. The director said he wasn't sure where to begin

'Woody Allen is a visionary creator who has made some of the greatest films of all-time, and it's an honor to be working with him on his first television series,' he said.

'From Annie Hall to Blue Jasmine, Woody has been at the creative forefront of American cinema and we couldn't be more excited to premiere his first TV series exclusively on Prime Instant Video next year.' 

The company said that additional details, such as casting information, will be made available in the future. There will be a full series and every episode will be written and directed by Allen.

Prime Instant Video is $99 for an annual membership and includes free two-day shipping on goods.

Amazon's original series 'Transparent' was awarded two Golden Globes - for best TV musical or comedy and for its star Jeffrey Tambor - at the event on Sunday night.

It meant Amazon became the first digital streaming service to win a Golden Globe for best TV series. Netflix and Hulu have also created their own original shows.

The Oscar-winning director's new project comes nearly a year after his adopted daughter, Dylan Farrow, wrote an open letter in the New York Times accusing him of sexually molesting her as a child.

Allen, 79, has always denied the abuse claims, which were first raised in the 1990s during a custody battle with her mother, actress Mia Farrow, and he has never been charged with criminal wrongdoing.

The filmmaker, who went on to marry one of his adopted daughters with Mia Farrow, has won four Oscars and two Golden Globes. Last year he was presented with the Golden Globes' Cecil B. DeMille Lifetime Achievement Award.

Before venturing into film, his skills were honed on television, where he first gained widespread notice in the early 1960s as a standup comic, and during the 1950s as a writer.

He has also penned magazine essays, books and plays, while a musical adaptation of his 1994 film comedy, 'Bullets Over Broadway,' ran on Broadway last year.
