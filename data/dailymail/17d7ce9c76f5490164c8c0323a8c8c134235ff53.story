Former world number one Lleyton Hewitt has set a date to end his celebrated tennis career with plans to play his 20th and last Australian Open next year. 

The 33-year-old plans to bypass the French Open to focus on one last crack at Wimbledon and Davis Cup glory before ending his career at Melbourne Park in 2016.

Hewitt outlined his dream farewell from tennis on Thursday after being confirmed as Australia's Davis Cup captain-in-waiting following Pat Rafter standing down.

The father of three said he hopes he won't be required to step up until after playing a part in a triumphant Australian campaign this year.

'I've thought long and hard,' he said.

'I plan to play the Aussie Open next year and most likely finish then.

'Obviously for me the Davis Cup is something we've worked extremely hard to put ourselves in a position in the World Group where we have a genuine shot.' 

With the emergence of two-time teenage grand slam quarter-finalist Nick Kyrgios and Bernard Tomic's resurgence, Hewitt believes Australia has the talent to win the prestigious teams' event for a 29th time in 2015.

'I believe with the guys now we have a lot more options, a lot more depth,' he said.

'I feel like I can still put my hand up as a player and help the boys get over the line.

'Whether that's singles, doubles, whatever is needed. Right at the moment that's the main focus for us.

'Personally, I'll be looking towards the grasscourt season and most likely finishing here in Melbourne, which for me would obviously be special to play 20 Australian Opens.'

The former world No.1 plans to play only sparingly in 2015 and says he'll 'most likely' skip Roland Garros to focus on Wimbledon, where he won his second and last grand slam crown in 2002.

As Australia's longest-serving and most prolific Davis Cup singles winner, Hewitt has long been groomed for the captaincy.

Pat Rafter stood down as skipper to formally assume the role as Tennis Australia's director of performance and said Hewitt would succeed interim captain Wally Masur 'when the time is right and ready'.

Masur, who won the Davis Cup twice as a player in 1983 and 1986 before serving as coach during John Fitzgerald's tenure, will take the reins for the World Group first-round tie against the Czech Republic in Ostrava from March 6-8.

'Lleyton has an undeniable link with Davis Cup and he will be captain one day,' Masur said.

'It's not in the model in Australian tennis to have a playing captain as such.

'Obviously (we) spoke to Lleyton a few days ago about it and we've come to the arrangement that he's still a player, he still has a career to flesh out and see where that ends.

'Until that happens, I'll be captain.'
