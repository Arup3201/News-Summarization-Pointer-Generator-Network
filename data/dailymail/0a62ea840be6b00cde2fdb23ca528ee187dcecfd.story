'It was all fists and then they starting picking on other guys and jumping them,' the witness told the Herald.

'I saw one of the guys who got stabbed running off but then he collapsed to the floor. The guy who had the knife just went away.

'There was a lot of blood. The knife was the length from the palm of your hand to your fingers.'

The fight was organised to be between two teenage members of two seperate families. The father and son who were stabbed came to help their family member,The Today Show reported. 

The victims have been identified as Trevor and Trent Allen.
