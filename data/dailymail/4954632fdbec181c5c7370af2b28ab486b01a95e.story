Bolton and Sheffield Wednesday are among clubs showing interest in Bradford City’s Filipe Morais who is available on a free transfer next month.

Portuguese-born midfielder Morais has broken into Phil Parkinson’s team in recent weeks and caught the eye with strong performances in the opening rounds of the FA Cup, where he scored goals against Halifax and Dartford.

He joined Bradford on a short-term deal in the summer after leaving Stevenage and has yet to extend the deal, although there is an offer on the table.

Former Chelsea youngster Filipe Morais could join Bolton or Sheffield Wednesday in January

Sheffield Wednesday boss Stuart Gray and Bolton manager Neil Lennon are both interested in signing Morais

Morais joined Chelsea’s academy as a teenager but did not make the breakthrough and has spent his career in Scotland with St Johnstone, Hibernian and Inverness Caledonian Thistle and in the Football League with MK Dons, Millwall, Oldham, Stevenage and Bradford. 

The 29-year-old has scored two goals in 19 games for Bradford so far this season.
