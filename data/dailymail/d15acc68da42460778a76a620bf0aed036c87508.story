Pensions minister Steve Webb warned everyone will have to work longer and no-one knows when people in their thirties can retire

Taking early retirement must become a thing of the past, pensions minister Steve Webb has warned dismissing complaints from people who hoped to stop working their fifties.

With Britons living longer adding to a ballooning pensions bill, Mr Webb said anyone who predicted when people in their thirties could retire was ‘lying’.

Campaigners have warned that government plans to link the state pension age with average life expectancy will mean making people work into their seventies.

Ministers will unveil a raft of policy for older people in the coming weeks, including a flat-rate weekly pension of around £155-a-week and reforms to social care to stop people having to sell their homes.

By 2018 the state pension age for women will be raised to 65, in line with men, before rising to 66 by 2020 and 67 by 2028.

The Coalition Mid-Term Review this week stated: 'We will put in place a new mechanism to ensure that the state pension age reflects future changes in life expectancy so that the state pension system continues to be sustainable and affordable.’

Mr Webb insisted the era of retiring early on large pensions was over.

‘People sometimes write to me who are aggrieved at our raising the state pension age,’ he said.

The option of retiring early will not be available to future generations, Mr Webb warned

‘For us, if people are going to live on average to late 80s and beyond, retiring in late 50s is just never going to make the sums add up.

‘I had a police officer who came to me the other day and complained that we had stopped him retiring at 52. We just can’t do this any more,’ he told a House of Lords inquiry.

Mr Webb also admitted that it was too early to predict what future rises in the state pension age will be. ‘If someone tells a 30 year old what their state pension age is going to be, they are lying,’ he said.
