The UK government is bidding for a £6million contract to help run prisons in Saudi Arabia.

Human rights groups have raised concerns about the deal, at a time of worldwide outrage at the country's justice system.

David Cameron has faced criticism for fawning tributes to the King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia – despite his country's shameful record on human rights.

Flags were ordered to fly at half-mast across Westminster while the Prime Minister joined Prince Charles to fly to Jeddah to pay his respects.

The reaction was condemned by critics who said King Abdullah's rule saw regular public beheadings and floggings – and homosexuality punished by death.

Now it has emerged that an arm of the UK's Ministry of Justice has submitted a £5.9million bid to 'to conduct a training needs analysis across all the learning and development programmes within the Saudi Arabian Prison Service'.

It raises the prospect of the UK government profiting from the Saudi regime through Just Solutions international (JSi), the commercial brand for the National Offender Management Service (NOMS) which is 'promoting products and services to international justice markets'.

JSi has also submitted a 'large scale bid' to the Royal Oman Police to help with the design of a new prison and last year won a £848,000 contract to support the development of a Probation Service in Macedonia.

However, the prospect of a deal with Saudi Arabia comes at a hugely sensitive time.

Saudi Arabia, which last year is reported to have carried out 87 beheadings, has attracted further outrage after the first public flogging of blogger Raif Badawi, 31, who was sentenced to 1,000 lashes and ten years in jail for highlighting the kingdom's harsh laws on dissent.

A video taken by a policeman last week of four colleagues dragging a woman down the street of Mecca and taking three attempts to behead her with a sword highlighted the crude brutality of the ruling regime's justice system.

In one of the most horrific cases during King Abdullah's reign, 15 schoolgirls died after religious police stopped them leaving a burning building because they were not in Islamic dress.

Allan Hogarth, Amnesty's UK head of policy and government affairs, told The Guardian: 'Amnesty has serious concerns about Saudi Arabia's justice system, given its use of the death penalty, the prevalence of torture in detention, and its use of cruel and degrading punishment.

'So we need to know – how is the MoJ's scheme going to help improve the situation?'

Adam Coogle, Middle East researcher at Human Rights Watch, said: 'Quiet training programmes are not a substitute for active British engagement with the Saudi authorities on human rights abuses in the justice system.

'We find that pressure works better when Saudi abuses are in the international spotlight. They don't usually tend to back down because someone has a private conversation. Public advocacy is necessary.'

If the deal goes ahead it would have to be signed off by the Foreign Office after an evaluation that covered human rights.

Full details of the contract, including human rights safeguards, will be made public if JSi is successful.

A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: 'Just Solutions international provides knowledge and expertise of prison and offender management services to international organisations and governments who work with offenders.

'It has been government policy for many years to work with overseas governments and help them develop their criminal justice systems, utilising that knowledge to bring funds to the public purse.

'JSi does not work with countries unless it is completely safe to do so and details of any contracts will be made public when agreed.'
