Flowers and heartfelt notes have been left at the scene where a mother-of-two died after she was hit by a car and slammed into a Belisha beacon in a suspected road rage incident.

Christie McHugh was sent flying onto a bonnet after a row erupted when she asked a woman to move her vehicle because it was blocking her car, witnesses said.

The office worker, whose children were sitting in her car, flipped off the other vehicle's bonnet and careered head first into a post as the car drove down a main road.

Tributes have been left at the scene, with flowers, prayers and messages of sympathy left at the beacon where the mother died.

Friends have left notes saying their prayers and thoughts are with Mrs McHugh's young family and that they miss the 'always happy' 33-year-old.

One read: 'An accident that should never have happened. Very, very sad.'

Another read: 'Thinking of you, miss you loads'.

A colleague of Mrs McHugh described her as a 'non-confrontational' person who was always smiling.George Leonidou, chief executive of Luxx Light Technology where she worked as a PA, said: 'She was non-confrontational, but she would have been fiercely protective of her children.

'We all miss her here, but we're talking about someone leaving a five-month-old daughter who will never know her mother, a five-year-old boy who is constantly asking when mummy's coming back.'

He said that staff at the company are all in shock at Mrs McHugh's death. She had only recently returned from maternity leave.

Mr Leonidou said: 'She was a lovely lady, always smiling, she loved her family and her children. She was a brilliant PA and had been with me for four years. She was the most conscientious worker I've ever had.

'We all miss her. The whole office and warehouse is in shock and we're just trying to work our way through it today. Yesterday was a very bad day.

'She will be sorely missed by everyone who knew her.'

Friends of the woman left messages saying the would miss her, as people were left stunned by the sudden death

Tragedy: Christie McHugh, 33, died from head injuries at the scene on East Barnet Road

Mrs McHugh was described as 'always happy, permanently happy, and just loved her kids and her husband'

A message on the Lord Kitchener's 
Facebook page said: 'After yesterday's sad and tragic accident, Paul and
all the staff send their deepest condolences to John and the kids and 
Christie's family, and a most sincere thank you to all the friends and 
customers that helped after the accident.'

Her friend Alice Cole described how Mrs McHugh slumped on the floor and died of head injuries minutes later after the scene in Barnet, north London.

She
is understood to have been with her five-year-old son Max and 
six-month-old daughter Lisa when she tried to leave the Lord Kitchener 
pub on Monday at about 6.30pm.

Ms Cole said Mrs McHugh noticed she was blocked in and asked the woman to move her car so she could get out.

‘Christie
came out to put kids in the car which was blocked,’ she said. ‘She 
asked the woman to move the car and the woman got quite verbal. Christie
has stood in the way and she has gone into her.

‘Christie stood blocking the car park to
say, "Stop, I want to have a word with you about being so rude".'

Apparently the car then moved off 
with Mrs McHugh on the bonnet and she hit a Belisha beacon - a black and
white pole with an amber globe that is used at pedestrian crossings. 

Ms Cole continued: 'Christie hit the lamppost at a height and then slumped down and the rest is history.’

One witness started to give Mrs 
McHugh a heart massage, but was unable to save her. Her 33-year-old 
husband John is understood to have been with her when she died.

Last night one friend said: ‘Now you’ve got two little kids without a mum and a grieving husband.

‘She
and John were great people, really kind, warm people. You’ve only got 
to look around the pub to see how many people loved her.’ Another added:
‘All this for just asking someone to move out of the way – it’s 
disgusting.’

Death: The woman, named by locals as Christie Marriott McHugh, is believed to have got into an argument with a woman outside the Lord Kitchener in Barnet, north London

Argument: The car park at the side of the pub is pictured.

Miss Cole
added: ‘She was just a woman who always had a smile on her face. You 
know how you get people in life who are always happy no matter what 
their lot is. That was her.

'She
was over the moon after getting her son into school. She was just 
always happy, permanently happy, and just loved her kids and her 
husband.’

Friend Margaret Powell said: ‘She was
very bubbly. I’m devastated by what happened. I cannot believe it, it’s
such a shock. She just didn’t deserve to go the way she was taken, way 
too soon. She was loved by many.’

Paul
Lawrence, landlord of the Lord Kitchener pub, added: ‘It is such a sad 
and tragic loss. She was lovely. A brilliant person with two lovely 
kids.’

Mrs McHugh, who
lived near the pub, worked at Luxx Light Technology in High Barnet as a
personal assistant to director George Leonidou.

He
said: ‘We’re finding it very difficult to function. We are lost without
her – absolutely lost. She was a fabulous person. The most 
conscientious worker I have ever had and a friend.’

A woman was arrested in Barnet in connection with the death and released on bail until April.

Officers
from Scotland Yard’s homicide and serous crime command are 
investigating the circumstances surrounding the death. Police are 
appealing for witnesses to come forward.
