A six-year-old hailed as one of Britain's most spoilt children has decided she's had enough of her reputation - and is giving away her prized possessions.

Lacie Pope, of Plymouth, Devon, has always been treated to glamorous designer frocks, expensive beauty products and jewel-encrusted toys.

Her mother Lisa Whitcombe, 34, loves to spoil her with Armani and Dior outfits, her own crown and even a child's Audi covered in crystals. 

Thinking of others: Lacie is giving up her Audi covered toy car worth £1,500 for charity

But on the eve of her sixth birthday - with £2,000 worth of celebrations ahead of her - Lacie has decided it's time to share her wealth. 

She told her parents she wants to give all her birthday presents to charity.

Her mother said Lacie had a crisis of conscience while watching a TV show Stand Up To Cancer.

Lacie is now auctioning off some of her belongings for charity, including an Audi covered toy car worth £1,500.

Lisa, a mother-of-three and former glamour model, said: 'Before her birthday Lacie just decided that she wanted to give all her presents away - I was pretty shocked.

'It all came from watching a TV show about Stand Up To Cancer. She was crying all the way through it.

'She couldn't stand the idea that there are children out there who have lost a parent to cancer, or have don't have food on the table.

'She decided that seeing as it was her birthday coming up that she would give away all her presents.

'Initially I didn't think she was being serious but Lacie was going on about it for days.

'She was stuck on the idea that she wanted to do something to help so in the end I had to agree.

'Over time I guess she realised it's just too much for any child, especially with her birthday and Christmas just around the corner.

'She doesn't want people thinking she's spoilt.'

Reputation: Lacie doesn't want people to think she's spoilt so she's taking action

Lacie's generous giveaway will also include a set of customised Cinderella slippers worth £45, a tutu covered in £65 worth of crystals, and a Swarovski crystal encrusted crown - worth around £80.

Despite lavishing around £2,000 on the birthday celebrations Lisa says she's happy to fulfill her daughter's wishes and proud she wants to help others.

Lacie is set to feature in the upcoming Channel 5 programme Blinging Up Baby, which features some of Britain's most pampered kids.

But while Lisa and her partner Cieran, a car salesman, admit they like to treat Lacie and their two other children, Daniel, four, and 10-week-old Emily-Ashley, they deny taking money for granted.

The family previously lived in a £350,000 villa in the glamorous Spanish resort of Marbella but have recently moved back to the UK.

Lisa, now a community nurse, says her daughter's wardrobe is stuffed full of expensive brands.

The youngster has also been booked in do catwalk training in London so she can follow in her mum's modelling footsteps.

Lisa said: 'She does wears Armani, Dior, Chanel and Juicy Couture - but nothing fancy, just normal clothes.

'As a family we go to the salon to get our hair and nails done but there's nothing wrong with that. We do shop at Asda and Debenhams as well.

'I like to keep the kids looking nice. I am the world's biggest critic when it comes to looks but I think that a well presented child is a confident child.

'What with all the filming, she's had a great time and a lot of special days out.

'They would hire out an entire swimming pool or an indoor play area and to Lacie it was just more and more treats.

'Over time I guess she realised it's just too much for any child, especially with her birthday and Christmas just around the corner.

Raising money: The bespoke Audi will be auctioned off to raise funds for Hugs for Henry, a charity set up to support four-year-old Henry Hallam who is fighting a rare form of cancer

'I think I can take some credit as a parent for the fact that she realised it was the right thing to do, I'm quite chuffed really.

'We're not sure where the presents are going yet. Lacie's only request is that they go towards making another child happy.

'She thinks it's really sad that some children don't have food, or parents, and she wants to make them happy.'

Lisa says the bespoke Audi will probably be auctioned off to raise funds for Hugs for Henry, a charity set up to support four-year-old Henry Hallam who is fighting a rare form of cancer.

The rest of the gifts will either go to a charity shop or be sold off.

Lisa added: 'I don't know why we are being featured in 'Blinging Up Baby' - we're just a normal family really.

'Maybe it's because we lived in Marbella, I don't know. My children are just normal.

'I think that any parent who has the means to supply for their children should be able to do so in whatever way they want.

'I would never put real fur on a child or give them a Rolex but I do like to treat them on their birthdays.

'Spoiling my children is done in moderation, just on birthdays and Christmas. I have been there when I can't afford presents and you don't have a thing for the kids.

'The year Lacie was born I found myself out of work and we did all we could just to get the Christmas dinner on the table and a couple of presents from Poundland.

'I'm not stuck up and we're completely appreciative of what we have got. I would be heart-broken if our children turned out to be self-centred but I'm very confident they won't.'
