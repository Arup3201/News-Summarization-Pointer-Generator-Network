The Dow Jones industrial average closed above 16,000 for the first time ever Thursday as unemployment numbers shrank along with inflation.

It was the first day the market grew following three losing sessions. The Dow hit 16,000 for the first time on Tuesday but closed below that number.

‘I think the stock market will be on a rising track for the rest of the year,’ said Margie Patel, senior portfolio manager at Wells Capital Management.

Record-breaking: For the first time ever, the Dow Jones Industrial average closed above 16,000 points after a 109 point uptick on Thursday

Applications for unemployment benefits dropped last week to the lowest level since September. The number of applications is close to where it was before the Great Recession.

The Dow rose 109 points, or 0.7 percent, to 16,010 Thursday.

Although investors remain unsure about the timing of the Federal Reserve's scaling back of its $85 billion per month in bond buying, some say the market will weather the eventual pullback in that stimulus.

Investors largely believe markets are due to pull back, even though the rally may continue, thanks to the Fed.

The U.S. central bank has said repeatedly that it will not withdraw support until the economy can stand on its own. A combination of a growing economy and Fed support gives investors a good reason to buy stocks, Steven Einhorn, vice chairman of Omega Advisors, told the Summit.

Improvements: Applications for unemployment benefits dropped last week to the lowest level since September. The number of applications is close to where it was before the Great Recession

The Dow closed above 16,000 points for the first time ever Thursday on news that unemployment has reached near pre-recession lows and as inflation subdued.

16K AND COUNTING: The Dow Jones industrial average closed above 16,000 for the first time after applications for unemployment benefits dropped last week. The number of applications, a proxy for how many workers are being laid off, is now near where it was before the Great Recession.

GOVERNMENT OUT OF GM: General Motors rose after the U.S. government said it expects to sell its remaining stake in the company by the end of the year. The Treasury Department still owns 31.3 million shares of the auto giant after bailing it out five years ago.

HOME FRONT: Williams-Sonoma jumped $4.23, or 7.6 percent, to $59.74 after the company said its third-quarter net income rose 16 percent as customers spent more at its West Elm and PBteen stores.

There is ‘a whole host of things the Fed can do to mitigate and moderate the sting’ of a pullback in bond buying, Einhorn said. That includes more forward guidance for markets, which the members of the Federal Open Market Committee discussed during their most recent meeting, minutes released on Wednesday showed.

The annual inflation rate is at 1 percent, below the Fed's target of 2 percent.

James Bullard, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis and a voting member of the FOMC, said on Thursday that the inflation data gives the central bank some leeway to keep the current accommodative policy in place.

‘What we need to do is continue with the program for now as we have, but if an inflation problem starts to develop, we have to be willing to move to arrest that problem,’ Bullard told a University of Arkansas event. ‘At that point, I'd put on my inflation hawk hat and spring into action.’

Expectations that the Fed could start 
cutting stimulus - but without raising interest rates - have helped to 
widen the spread between long- and short-run debt. That benefits banks, 
which make money borrowing at short rates and lending at longer rates. 
Bank of America Inc (BAC.N) shares jumped 3 percent to close at $15.59.

The
 Dow Jones industrial average .DJI shot up 109.17 points, or 0.69 
percent, to close at a record 16,009.99. The Standard & Poor's 500 
Index .SPX gained 14.48 points, or 0.81 percent, to finish at 1,795.85. 
The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC climbed 47.89 points, or 1.22 percent, 
to end at 3,969.16.

The 
number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell 
more than expected last week, while producer prices fell for a second 
straight month in October, indicating inflation pressures remain muted.

‘The
 (new claims) number we got this morning is very, very robust ... We've 
been handed a few one-two punches - the government shutdown, the payroll
 tax increase - but guess what, like Elton John, the economy is still 
standing,’ said Anthony Chan, chief economist at Chase Private Client.
