A city firm that was paid £1.5million to advise the Government on the sale of Royal Mail also made a fortune for its clients from selling shares in the postal giant, it emerged yesterday.

The controversial stock market float made billions for investors but left taxpayers £750million out of pocket on the first day of trading.

Now it has been revealed that while one branch of firm Lazard advised on the sale, another arm of the same company made millions selling the shares.

Prime Minister David Cameron repeatedly insisted the sell-off had been a success but Labour leader said the deals with hedge funds mean the privatisation  'stinks'

Lazard
 Limited is the parent company of Lazard & Co, which was one of the 
companies to advise the Government, and Lazard Asset Management, which 
bought and sold the shares.

LAM
 was given a special allocation of six million shares in Royal Mail as a
 ‘priority’ investor. By comparison, ordinary investors were typically 
given just £750 each, while anybody who applied for more than £10,000 of
 shares was given nothing.

LAM
 bought and sold them all within days and made an instant profit of 
£8million for its clients – making a mockery of Business Secretary Vince
 Cable’s insistence that Royal Mail shares should only be sold to 
long-term, stable investors.

During
 a heated grilling by MPs, Lazard insisted that the two arms of the 
company were ring-fenced. But MPs said its involvement in both aspects 
of the sale  was ‘inappropriate’.

Senior Liberal Democrat minister Vince Cable has faced calls to resign over his handling of the Royal Mail privatisation - but has insisted he has nothing to apologise for

Speaker John Bercow tried to humiliate David Cameron in the Commons today by cutting him off mid-sentence.

During raucous exchanges at Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Cameron was shouted down by Labour MPs.

As the PM tried to attack Labour's criticism of the Royal Mail sell-off, Mr Bercow stood to intervene.

Mr Cameron remarked: 'I've not finished.'

But smiling broadly, Mr Bercow hit back: 'The Prime Minister has finished and he can take it from me he has finished.'

The slapdown marks a new low in the relationship between Mr Cameron and Mr Bercow, who was a Tory MP before becoming Speaker.

For
 the past six months, the Government has refused to reveal the name of 
the 16 ‘priority’ investors, insisting the information was confidential.
 But Mr Cable broke his silence yesterday and published the list, saying
 it was in the public interest.

Other
 top investors include sovereign wealth funds, such as the Abu Dhabi 
Investment Authority, and the Soros fund, run by billionaire investor 
George Soros.

Lansdowne 
Partners, the hedge fund whose former chief executive Sir Paul Ruddock 
is a large donor to the Conservative Party, was another big winner. Alan
 Custis, a managing director at LAM, told MPs on the Public Accounts 
Committee that it had set a ‘price target’ for the shares of £3.95.

They
 were floated at £3.30, a price which Lazard & Co had advised the 
Government was the maximum price which City investors were prepared to 
pay.

Mr Custis said the decision had been made to sell the shares when the price reached £4.70 within the first few days of trading.

Mr
 Custis told MPs: ‘We had a price target. The share price went beyond 
the price target and, yes, we did sell on behalf of the clients of 
Lazards. On behalf of the clients we made approximately £8million.’

He added that the profit for LAM itself was only around £40,000.

Business Secretary Vince Cable has come under fire from all sides over his handling of the controversial Royal Mail sell-off

William
 Rucker, chief executive of Lazard & Co, said: ‘When we became 
aware, having been hired, that Lazard Asset Management were on a list of
 investors the Royal Mail were talking to, we made it quite clear that 
we should have no input whatsoever into any discussions about 
allocations for LAM.

‘The Chinese wall is complete and utter. We have had no contact throughout.’

Labour
 MP Margaret Hodge, who chairs the committee, said the situation was 
‘just inappropriate’, and said the finance world was like an 
‘institutional masonic lodge’.

Despite
 strict ring-fencing systems in place, known as Chinese walls, she said:
 ‘It just feels wrong’, adding: ‘It ends up with too cosy a relationship
 and what then  happened was this little group of very high asset 
management [firms] made a killing at the expense of the ordinary 
taxpayer who lost out to the tune on day one  of £750million.’

Yesterday
 Labour leader Ed Miliband accused David Cameron of ‘ripping off the 
taxpayer’ after the Government ‘grossly under-valued’ the postal giant.
