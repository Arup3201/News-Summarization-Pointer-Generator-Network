Rupert Murdoch’s newspaper empire ‘shopped their own staff’ to police in a bid to avoid corporate prosecution for phone hacking and corrupt payments, a court heard yesterday.

A top lawyer at the US parent company of the News of the World and Sun newspapers described the prospect of a corporate charge as ‘apocalyptic’, threatening 46,000 jobs in America if it went bust.

Yesterday Kingston Crown Court heard News Corporation’s management standards committee (MSC), set up internally to investigate business practices, believed that by handing material on individual employees to police it would save the company. But police denied any deal was done.

The revelation came in the trial of six senior Sun journalists accused of ‘corruption on a grand scale’ paying police, soldiers, prison and hospital staff for stories over a decade. 

Head of news, Chris Pharo, 45, picture editor John Edwards, 50, managing editor Graham Dudman, 51, deputy news editor Ben O’Driscoll, 38, and reporters Jamie Pyatt, 51, and John Troup, 49, are accused of conspiring to corrupt public officials, paying for information about celebrities, murderers and royals. All six deny the charges.

Nigel Rumfitt QC, defending Pharo, said: ‘They (MSC) were keen to be seen to co-operate with the police.’ 

Detective Superintendent Mark Kandiah agreed: ‘They certainly were co-operative.’ Mr Rumfitt said: ‘In slang, they were shopping their own staff.’ 

The company received a letter in May 2012 from the CPS informing them a corporate liability charge was a possibility. 

Minutes of a meeting a month later between the MSC and police indicated committee chairman Lord Grabiner was not sure the firm would have assisted ‘if they had been told this last year’.

In another meeting News Corporation lawyer Gerson Zweifach said 46,000 jobs were at risk.

The minutes read: ‘It [a prosecution] could kill the corporation. This job [co-operating with police] was to defend the company... The downstream effect of a prosecution would be devastating and apocalyptic.’

Mr Rumfitt said: ‘The point he was making was if the company was charged, rather than individual employees...the company could go bust.’ The trial continues.
