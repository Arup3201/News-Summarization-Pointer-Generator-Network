Police last night demanded the resignation of Andrew Mitchell after a make-or-break meeting with officers from his local forces backfired.

The attempt by the Tory Chief Whip to clear the air failed when he refused to say exactly how he abused officers in Downing Street.

Police responded by saying that Mr Mitchell was accusing members of the diplomatic protection squad of lying.

Under fire Tory chief whip Andrew Mitchell visited a Tesco store in his Sutton Coldfield constituency today, before a showdown with police later over his 'plebgate' outburst at Downing Street officers

Mr Mitchell also opened The Holistic Practice in his constituency before meeting Police Federation leaders who say they want a full explanation or will demand his resignation

Ken Mackaill, of West Mercia Police 
Federation, emerged from the meeting to say: ‘I think Mr Mitchell’s 
position is untenable and if he won’t resign I don’t think Mr  Cameron 
has any option but to sack him.’

Police protecting No 10 claim Mr 
Mitchell called them ‘f****** plebs’ and told them they should ‘know 
their place’ when they refused to let him through the main gates of 
Downing Street on his bicycle.

But apart from admitting to swearing he has flatly refused to reveal what he did say.

Chief Whip Andrew Mitchell arrived for work by car yesterday and made his way into No10 by a side door

‘He said he did not want to get into a
firefight with the police or impugn the integrity of police officers 
but  unfortunately we’re left in the position where his continued denial
of facts recorded in police records does exactly that,’ Mr Mackaill 
said.

Labour's shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper called on David Cameron to sack Mr Mitchell

‘I think Mr Mitchell has no option 
but to resign. He’s continuing to refuse to elaborate on what happened. I
think his position is untenable.’ The Metropolitan Police officers who 
were abused have accepted Mr Mitchell’s apology but Mr Mackaill said 
officers in his force have a ‘massive issue’ with their colleagues’ 
truthfulness being questioned.

The Chief Whip’s future is now 
hanging by a thread after senior Tories continue to express the view he 
is a ‘dead man walking’ because he has lost authority with Conservative 
MPs.

At least six members of the Cabinet 
believe he will be unable to do his job effectively and he has become an
open object of ridicule among Tory MPs. The confrontation came as 
Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said he thought Mr Mitchell should come
clean and warned that police throughout the country are angry with him.

‘I have no idea what he said. There seems to be competing claims about what was and wasn’t said,’ he said.

‘There is a dispute about words. He has got to explain himself to the Police Federation.

'There is a very strong feeling amongst all officers, not just in the Met.’

Mr Clegg said what Mr Mitchell did 
‘was very, very wrong’ and refused to say that he enjoys his confidence.
He added: ‘It is bad enough to be rude to a police officer at the best 
of times, but doing it at the time when those two police officers had 
just been gunned down in Manchester made it all the worse.’

A friend of Mr Mitchell said he would not quit, insisting: ‘Andrew’s position hasn’t changed. He is carrying on with his work.’

A Downing Street spokesman said: ‘The
Prime Minister has said that what Andrew did was completely 
unacceptable but he has apologised to the officers concerned and it is 
time to draw a line under it.’

London Mayor Boris Johnson has said it would have been 'commonsensical' for police to arrest Mr Mitchell

David Cameron, Prime Minister, September 26: ‘What happened was very regrettable. It must never happen again.’

Boris Johnson, London Mayor, September 25: ‘There was a proposal to arrest Mr Mitchell... That seems to be wholly commonsensical.’

Theresa May, Home Secretary, October 7: 'I have had a conversation with Andrew Mitchell... I was not happy.’

Philip Hammond, Defence Secretary, October 7: ‘This has been a very damaging affair.’

Eric Pickles, Communities Secretary, September 23 : ‘I am not defending in any way the fact that Mr Andrew Mitchell lost his temper with police officers. I’m not a public schoolboy, I’m not a millionaire... Now whether this guy was a millionaire or not a millionaire, he shouldn’t have lost his rag.”

Patrick McLoughlin, Transport Secretary, September 27: ‘Andrew Mitchell should not have done what he did.’

Grant Shapps, Tory party chairman, October 10: ‘Look that rudeness was unforgivable.’

Lord Tebbit, ex-Tory party chairman, October 10: 'I don’t think anybody would shed buckets of tears if he were to fall on his sword.'

David Davis, former shadow home secretary, October 4: ‘He will have a difficult time. What does a Chief Whip have at his fingertips to deploy normally? Well, a mixture of charm, rewards, appeals to loyalty – all of those are diluted at the moment.’
