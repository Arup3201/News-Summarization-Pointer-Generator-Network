It was the generation of dodgy haircuts, questionable tracksuits... and, yes, VHS dating.

A new video, highlighting the cringe-factor of the video dating adverts, which were once deemed a good way to meet a potential partner in the Eighties, has found its way online.

Now, it's being used in a Canadian advert, and is chock full of cheesy pick-up lines, talk of 'working out at the gym,' and explanations as to why one woman doesn't like men who 'when they laugh'.

Star of the show: Donny explains how his work in the gym and on the arm wrestling circuit earned him the name 'Big D'

Entitled ‘Date Night,’ the hilarious commercial channels the world of VHS dating in all its glory, perhaps making modern-day daters grateful for websites and apps.

Among the characters there is Donny, who is referred to as ‘Big D’ in the gym and on the arm wrestling circuit, apparently.

And Connie who doesn’t like it when men grunt and snort while laughing.

Sporting a pair of over-sized glasses and a moustache, one man says: ‘If you don’t believe in love at first sight, let me reintroduce myself,’ before giving a little smirk.

While a hipster-looking type stares down the camera and says: ‘I once made love in the sewers of New York City.’

Complementing the characters are some wonderfully coloured backdrops and some state-of-the-art fades between shots.

The commercial concludes with Donny stating: ‘When I start nibbling on this sucker,’ while stroking his earlobe, ‘it’s game over,’ as the introductory music returns.

According to CBC News Nova Scotia, the company were going to use real footage from the 80s but instead used actors to deliver the lines.

The original video, which has gained much attention, has been viewed over 120,000 times on Youtube and people have commented such things as: ‘Well played, Halifax. Well played,’ in appreciation.

Oversized glasses, terrible hair and creepy moustaches feature throughout the advert to give it an authentic 80s feel 

And according to Downtown Halifax Business Commission, the advert has been a commercial success too.

Commenting on their site, they wrote: ‘Our date night packages are sold out! But that doesn't mean you can't have a great night on the town in Downtown Halifax.

‘Who knows, maybe you'll run into Big D or Connie. They love it here. And they have great taste.’
