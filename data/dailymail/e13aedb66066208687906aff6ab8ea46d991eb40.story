After a slow start to the season followed by a lengthy injury lay-off, some Arsenal fans were beginning to doubt the abilities of German playmaker Mesut Ozil.

Following a long, and ultimately successful, World Cup campaign, Ozil had failed to hit the ground running when he returned to North London.

But since recovering from a knee injury which kept him out of the team for over three months, the star has rediscovered the form that led Arsene Wenger to spend £42million to bring him to England from Real Madrid.

Ozil was brilliant again against Middlesbrough on Sunday, creating seven chances for his team-mates

Passes                       97

Passing accuracy      92.8%

Duels won                  5

Recoveries                 6

Shots on target          2

Successful crosses    100%

Chances created        7

Ozil has three goals and two assists in just five starts since his return from injury, and is linking brilliantly with Arsenal's newest star Alexis Sanchez.

That compares favourably with the one goal and two assists he managed in the nine games before injuring himself against Chelsea in October. 

To cap it all off, Ozil produced a superb display in Sunday's FA Cup win over Middlesbrough, to keep up his perfect record in the competition.

Since moving to the Emirates in 2013, Ozil has played seven FA Cup ties, winning all of them. 

The German midfielder helped the Gunners end their trophy drought at Wembley last season, and has now played a big part in the side reaching the quarter-finals as they look to defend the cup.

During Sunday's game against Middlesbrough he created seven chances, the most of any player in the cup this weekend, and was so good that Boro boss Aitor Karanka even asked him for his shirt at the end of the game.

Ozil's imperious display, in which he linked brilliantly with the rest of Arsenal's dangerous forward line, saw him complete 93% of his 97 passes, recover the ball six times for his team, and constantly create chances against the promotion candidates.

Arsene Wenger must be delighted that Ozil is finally showing his best form as Arsenal begin the final push for Champions League football.
