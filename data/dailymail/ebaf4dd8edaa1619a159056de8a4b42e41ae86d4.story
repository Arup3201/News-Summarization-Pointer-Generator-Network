An HIV positive student accused of exposing a gay lover to the disease allegedly filmed himself having unprotected sex with other men in his university dorm room, police have claimed.

Detectives investigating Michael Johnson, 22, say they have seized a cache of videos allegedly filmed covertly showing him with a string of, as yet, unidentified people he picked up via social media.

Officers fear Johnson may have had intimate contact with more than 30 other men who might not know they are at risk of sexual diseases.

Allegations: The St. Charles Police Department believe that Michael Johnson, pictured, secretly filmed his lovers

In October, last year, the student and
 former wrestler at Lindenwood University in St Charles, Missouri, was 
charged with exposing sexual partners to HIV.

A month later, four more felony charges were filed.

But now police have revealed that during their probe into the allegations they found 32 incriminating videos on his laptop.

St. Charles County prosecutor Tim Lohmar told local station KMOV: 'On that laptop were 32 videos that depicted different individuals engaged in sexual acts with Mr Johnson.

'It's safe to safe that numerous
 of those videos were taken inside his dorm room; we know that because 
we recognize the furniture.'

The
 St. Charles Police Department believe that his sex partners did not 
know that he had the virus or that their actions were being filmed.

One is of a victim already identified,
 but police are still trying to find out how many different men are 
depicted on the other tapes.

Police are now appealing for anyone else who was a sexual partner of Johnson to contact St. Charles Detective Bureau at 
636-949-3330.

Appeal: Police are asking anyone who had been intimate with Michael Johnson, pictured, to contact them

'It's a matter not only of their individual safety but public safety as well,' Lohmar said to KMOV.

The
 St. Charles Police Department began investigating Johnson after a former lover complained he had contracted HIV, which leads to AIDS, and gonorrhoea after sex in his university dorm room.

Officers have spent the last five months building the case but are still keen to hear from anyone who might have more information.
