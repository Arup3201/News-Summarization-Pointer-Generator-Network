Lee Westwood has admitted he has grown tired of people calling him 'The Hoff' after the golfer rescued a drowning British tourist  last Friday.

Westwood came to the aid of Colin Davies, a businessman from Solihull who suffers from Parkinson's disease, after he got into difficulty off the coast of Barbados.

Former World No 1 golfer Westwood has since been subjected to jokes referring to David Hasselhoff's starring role in Baywatch, the American drama series about lifeguards.

Mr Davies said Westwood heard his cry for help and dived into the water. He was later brought ashore where beach-goers pointed out the famous face

The 41-year-old has revealed the jokes, that he initially found funny, are beginning to wind him up and even threatened to punch the next person to reference the actor.   

'It was funny at first,' Westwood is quoted as saying in The Sun. 'Guys kept calling me "The Hoff" on the range and in the clubhouse.

'But I swear I'll take a swing at the next one to do it.'

The Ryder Cup star was holidaying on the island with his wife Laurae and was within earshot of Davies' cries for help before rushing in to save the tourist.

Davies told the Birmingham Mail: 'If there is a power looking over us, I hope he takes note and delivers three majors to this kind and gentle human being.

Westwood is currently in the UAE ahead of the start of the Dubai Desert Classic on Thursday and played in a Challenge Match on Tuesday.
