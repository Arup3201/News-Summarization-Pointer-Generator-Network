21-year-old Joshua Sekulic is charged on two counts of sexual assault and one count of battery

A 21-year-old Florida college student, Joshua Sekulic, is charged of sexual assault against two women and battery charges against a third who managed to escape his biting grip. The junior at Florida Gulf Coast University wrote 'apology' letters to two of his alleged rape victims and claimed that he didn't know they didn't want to have sex.Sekulic was arrested on Monday after two FGCU students told campus security that they were raped. Another female student told campus police that she was physically assaulted.The International Business Times reports that Two of the victim's stories claim that Sekulic raped them not once, but twice after he'd demanded sex and they'd said no. Both alleged rapes took place at the victims' apartments. The third victim managed to escape from Sekulic after she asked him to leave and he pinned her down on her bed and bit her. Once she freed herself, Sekulic left her residence. WINK news reported that one of the letters to Sekulic's victims states that an invitation inside her apartment led him to conclude that she wanted to have sex. He writes, 'I am sorry for making that assumption. What transpired that night was a mistake.'

He allegedly told a victim, 'I have to do this,' and that they would have 'emotionless' sex for the rest of their life

Sekulic continues by saying,'I did not mean to force anything on you or make you do anything you did not want to do. You are a great person and I am sorry for those events and a truely (sic) do wish you the best. Once again, am sorry for the events that transpired and I hope this apology helps you somewhat. And I wish you the best.'Police say that Sekulic forced his second victim into having oral sex with him. He wrote her a letter saying, 'I am sorry about the events that happened on the 30th of October I was under the impression you wanted too (sic) have sex. I did not think that you wanted me to stop and I kept going. For that I am sorry and I wish you the best and I hope everything is OK.'

A victim's police report details Sekulic's cruel behavior and indicates he knew his victim's lacked sexual interest.

He allegedly told one victim, 'You are completely emotionless and this is how sex will be for the rest of your life. I've (expletive and identifying of Sekulic's other unnamed victim) with the lights off, because she is the exact same way, emotionless.'

He told his victim, 'I have to do this.'

Sekulic has confessed to his crimes and says he hopes his apology will help them cope with the events.

According to Slate, parts of his letter call his victim, 'a great person' and that say that an invitation inside of the apartment was indicative of wanting to have sex. This shows that Sekulic might be coaxing his victims not to report the crime by accusing them of sending mixed signals.Â 

RAINN reports that only 3 out of 100 rapists serve time in prison because most rape victims don't report on crime.

According to a national study of rape among college students reported by Roger Williams University, one in four college women have either been raped or suffered from an attempted rape. 84 per cent of college women raped know their attackers.

A representative from the FGCU campus police told the Mail Online that there are ongoing programs dedicated promoting the safety and health of university students. They would not comment further on the case.
