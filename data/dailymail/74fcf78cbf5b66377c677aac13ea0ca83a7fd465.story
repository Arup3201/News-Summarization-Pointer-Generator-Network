When a newspaper asked readers if documentary Blackfish had altered their perception of the Orlando SeaWorld, employees of the attraction spammed the poll, with over half of the responses coming from an internet address at the park.

The highly acclaimed CNN film was made after SeaWorld trainer Dawn Brancheau was pulled underwater and killed by the park’s star attraction, the 22-feet-long orca Tilikum, in 2010.

The animal was previously associated with the deaths of two other trainers.

The film explores theories that keeping killer whales in captivity actually makes the animals psychotic and a danger to humans.

CNN said: ‘The film is a story about the consequences of captivity for these animals that have thrilled millions in performances, but lead a much darker existence when the show is over.’

The poll, run by the Orlando Business Journal, asked its readers: ‘Has CNN's Blackfish documentary changed your perception of SeaWorld?’

The paper then discovered that 54 per cent of the votes cast - 180 of the 328 made altogether - came from one SeaWorld internet address.

When the paper put its findings to the park, a spokesman said that employees were encouraged to be vocal with their feelings.

He said: ‘Our team members have strong feelings about their park and company, and we encourage them to make their opinions known.

‘Each of those votes that came from SeaWorld were cast by a team member who is passionate about who we are and what we do.’

The Orlando Business Journal revealed that the SeaWorld employees needn’t have worried, because it discovered that even with their votes removed, over 90 per cent of the respondents said that Blackfish hadn’t changed their opinion of the park.
