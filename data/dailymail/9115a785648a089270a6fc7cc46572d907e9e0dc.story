A Facebook director who told a public inquiry last week that the company had cracked down on ‘multiple identities’ was himself operating a ‘shadow’ log-in on the social networking site.

Richard Allan, Facebook’s director of policy for Europe, told the Leveson Inquiry into media ethics that the company enforced a strict ban on people who did not represent themselves under their real identity. 

Lord Allan, an ex-Lib Dem MP and aide to Nick Clegg, who was hired last year to lobby the European Union on Facebook’s behalf, said the policy was rigorously enforced to stop people using bogus identities to carry out malicious acts.

However, at the time Lord Allan spoke, he had two ‘presences’ on the site: One, ‘Richard Allan’, shows pictures and links to his work on Facebook.

The other, ‘Ric Allan’, contained a silhouette in place of a picture and gave no indication of who lay behind it apart from ten ‘friends’, including the divorced peer’s girlfriend.

After The Mail on Sunday started  to make inquiries about the ‘Ric Allan’ identity on Friday, it was swiftly deleted. 

Lord Allan told the inquiry that if people came to the site and did not present themselves under their real identity, they would not have a ‘meaningful experience’.

‘We have a security team constantly looking for the people trying to get around the system,’ he said.

‘The sort of people carrying out malicious behaviour will use false identities. We find the strongest protection is that community of users.

Privacy is a notion at the heart of what we’re trying to do.’

Both the ‘Richard Allan’ and the ‘Ric Allan’ Facebook identities include  Ana Padilla as one of the friends. Dr Padilla, who works for the parliamentary office of science and technology at the House of Commons, is the mother of Lord Allan’s twin babies.

The issue of Facebook identities became controversial last year when author Salman Rushdie was told he had to use his birth name Ahmed on his profile instead of his middle name Salman.

His account was deactivated until he made the change to reflect the name on his identity documents.

Lord Allan was Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg’s immediate predecessor as MP for Sheffield Hallam and acted as Mr Clegg’s campaign manager when he first stood for the seat in 2005. 

A Facebook spokesman said: ‘Richard Allan is an active user of Facebook, using his real identity. There was also an old Facebook account that he set up in 2009 and has not actively used since then. 

‘He should have deactivated that account when he created a new one and this is exactly what he did as  soon as he was reminded that the old account was still live.’
