Patients will soon be able to find out whether their GP or hospital is rationing drugs to save money.

Ministers are to force all NHS trusts to publish lists of any new treatments they are refusing to give patients – even though they have been approved by the health watchdog NICE.

Under the plans – which will be rolled out this Autumn – trusts will also have to explain to the public why these drugs are not yet available.

New plans: Patients will soon be able to find out whether their GP or hospital is rationing drugs to save money

The Government hopes the scheme will end the so-called postcode lottery of NHS treatment whereby a patient’s chance of being offered certain drugs may be entirely dependent on where they live.

Only last year it emerged as many as a quarter of all Primary Care Trusts were refusing to prescribe patients some treatments even though they had been approved for NHS use by the National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence, or NICE.

Trusts were found to be trying to save money by holding back life-extending cancer treatments as well as medicines for heart disease, asthma, diabetes and epilepsy.

Health Minister Paul Burstow said patients had a right to drugs and treatments that were approved by NICE

Ministers hope the so-called new ‘scorecards’ will encourage trusts to make the drugs available as soon as they are approved by NICE.

Health Minister Paul Burstow said: ‘Patients have a right to drugs and treatments that have been approved by NICE. This new regime will be a catalyst for change - we are determined to eradicate variation and drive up standards for everyone.

‘NHS organisations must make sure the latest NICE-approved treatments are available in their area, and if they are not, then they will now be responsible for explaining why not. Being transparent with data like this is the hallmark of a 21st century NHS. It is a fundamental tool to help healthcare professionals improve patient care.’

Sir Andrew Dillon, chief executive of NICE said: ‘It will be valuable not just to patients but also help hospitals assess how well they’re performing and ensure that best practice is rapidly disseminated across the NHS.

‘We know that changing professional practice in medicine, like any other profession, can take time. Doctors, although broadly positively orientated, nevertheless take time to be made aware of the benefits of new treatments and drugs for the patients they are responsible for.’

But critics, including senior GPs and NHS managers, warned the system would create ‘unnecessary bureacracy’ – which may even delay treatments being made available.

Dr Clare Gerada, chair of the Royal College of GPs said: ‘Will it be a bureaucratic tickbox or will it be something more sensible?

And David Stout, deputy chief executive of the NHS Confederation warned publishing the lists would create incur extra costs on the health service’s  increasingly strained budget.

He said: ‘Any new costs have to be offset by savings elsewhere.

‘It is important that any new measures do not lead to unnecessary bureaucracy or a duplication of information with no real benefits for hospitals, GPs or patients.’

Currently some Primary Care Trusts (PCTs) delay offering new drugs as recommended by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (Nice), while other areas use them on patients straight away.

Under the scheme, which is expected to be rolled out before autumn, hospitals will have 'no excuse not to provide the latest NICE-approved drugs and treatments', the Department of Health said.

NHS organisations will be automatically added on to publicly available lists of what drugs are available in local areas.

It is hoped the rules will create a level playing field for treatments such as IVF, for which patients living in different regions have had varying levels of opportunity for the treatment.

Last year a report found more than 70 per cent of NHS trusts were ignoring Nice guidance to offer infertile couples three chances at IVF, and some stopped funding treatment altogether.

The study, from a cross-party group of MPs, found PCTs placed strict restrictions on who is eligible for IVF.

Most PCTs put limits on the age at which they will treat women - but one PCT was only allowing women to be treated between the ages of 39 and 40.

This means younger women can wait years for NHS treatment despite the fact fertility declines with age.

Some of Nice’s most recent guidance, recommending an extended time to administer a clot-busting drug to treat stroke patients, for example, will soon have to be taken on by all hospitals.

The Department of Health said the regime will be made up of three different parts:

An 'innovation scorecard' will be published, which will allow patients and the public to see which organisations are quickly adopting the latest Nice-approved drugs and treatments;

The NHS will have no excuse not to provide the latest Nice-approved drugs and treatments. They will be automatically added onto lists of what drugs are available in local areas, which will be published for all to see. This means new drugs and treatments will be automatically made available for doctors to prescribe across the NHS;

Making the uptake of new drugs and treatments quicker by setting up a new group to help local NHS organisations implement Nice guidelines. New drugs and treatments can mean the NHS has to make big changes to the way they provide services, which can be a complicated process.
