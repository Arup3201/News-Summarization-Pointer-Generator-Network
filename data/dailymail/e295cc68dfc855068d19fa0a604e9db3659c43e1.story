Asteroids and comets repeatedly smashed into the early Earth and covered the planet's surface with molten rock during its earliest days, researchers have revealed.

However, they say there may have been a positive effect -  oases of water that could have supported the evolution of life.

Earth formed about 4.5 billion years ago - and it is believed its first billion years were far more dramatic than previously thought.

For much of its early life, Earth and its sister worlds in the inner solar system were pummeled with an extraordinary number of cosmic impacts, the new research shows

The first 500 million years of the Earth's life are known as the Hadean Eon.

Although this time amounts to more than 10 percent of Earth's history, little is known about it, since few rocks are known that are older than 3.8 billion years old.

The first 500 million years of the Earth's life are known as the Hadean Eon.

Although this time amounts to more than 10 percent of Earth's history, little is known about it, since few rocks are known that are older than 3.8 billion years old.

For much of the Hadean, Earth and its sister worlds in the inner solar system were pummeled with an extraordinary number of cosmic impacts, the new research shows.

Our planet was hit thousands of times by 'small' space debris, approximately 9 miles wide, researchers say.

But occasionally, asteroids larger than 300 miles wide struck the Earth’s surface, vaporising the Earth’s oceans, and filling the atmosphere with steam.

The meteor that exploded over Chelyabinsk, Russia in 2013 was 65 feet wide, and the asteroid that may have killed the dinosaurs was believed to be six miles wide, for comparison.

'Here we provide a new bombardment model of the Hadean Earth that has been calibrated using existing lunar and terrestrial data,' the team, led by Simone Marchi, a planetary scientist at the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado, wrote in Nature.

'We find that the surface of the Hadean Earth was widely reprocessed by impacts through mixing and burial by impact-generated melt.'

The new model indicates that the Earth’s surface would have been mixed up by impacts that caused its rocks to melt, and gives clues about the extreme conditions that existed when the Earth was in its infancy.

The early Earth, showing a surface pummeled by large impacts, resulting in extrusion of deep seated magma onto the surface. At the same time, distal portion of the surface could have retained liquid water.

The history of the Hadean Earth (approximately 4.0 to 4.5 billion years ago) is poorly understood because few known rocks are older than around 3.8 billion years old.

It is thought that roughly 4.5 billion years ago the Earth and Moon were being pummelled by asteroids, although the exact timing and magnitude of these impacts, and their effects on Earth’s evolution, are less well known.

Simone Marchi and co-authors estimate the early Earth’s impact history, calibrated using the existing data for the Moon, which with its heavily cratered surface provides a clear record of the event that bombarded the Earth–Moon system.

The new model suggests that the large impacts caused Earth’s surface to be widely reprocessed, a finding that may help to explain the absence of early terrestrial rocks and the age distribution of ancient zircons, minerals which have survived from the Hadean period.

The researchers believe that, with few areas on Earth escaping untouched by impacts, life emerging during the Hadean was probably resistant to the extreme conditions that existed at that time.

The researchers discovered that ;the surface of the Earth during the Hadean was heavily affected by very large collisions, by impactors larger than 100 kilometers (60 miles) or so — really, really big impactors,' Marchi said.

'When Earth has a collision with an object that big, that melts a large volume of the Earth's crust and mantle, covering a large fraction of the surface,'

The new findings suggest that Earth's surface was buried over and over again by large volumes of molten rock — enough to cover the surface of the Earth several times.

Any water vaporized near these impacts 'would rain down again,' Marchi said, and 'there may have been quiet tranquil times between collisions — there could have been liquid water on the surface.'

Marchi and his colleagues detailed their findings in the July 31 issue of the journal Nature.
