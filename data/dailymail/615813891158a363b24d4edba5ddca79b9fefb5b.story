Like the late Princess Diana before her, the Duchess of Cambridge has chosen to have her baby at the Lindo Wing at St Mary’s in Paddington, west London, royal sources revealed today - where staying in a private suite for a natural birth is likely to cost up to £10,000.

The internationally renowned wing, where Princes William and Harry were born, is a dedicated private facility which caters for complex pregnancies and deliveries, as well as multiple births.

Deluxe rooms or a suite are available on request - and each one is fitted with satellite TV, a radio, a safe, bedside phone and fridge.

Following the royal baby's arrival, Kate
 and her guests can choose from a comprehensive wine list should they 
wish to enjoy a glass of Champagne and a toast.

The Duchess will also be able to access the internet and have a choice of daily newspapers delivered to her room each morning throughout her stay.

And if the new mum has any special dietary requests, a dedicated kitchen staff will be on hand to cater to her needs.

The Lindo Wing has a team of maternity support workers and nursery nurses who can offer advice and reassurance to all new mothers staying there.

The wing provides expert consultant-led obstetric, neonatal care and anaesthetist care with 24-hour access to Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust’s state-of-the-art maternal and foetal specialist services.

Part of the Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, St Mary's is described as having 'modern, consultant-led world-class care'.

The hospital also has a special care section, The Winnicott Baby Unit.

It can look after up to 18 babies at a time in intensive care, high dependency or special care.

Around 350 premature or sick newborn babies are cared for each year by the multidisciplinary team .

The Lindo Wing was re-opened in June 2012 after extensive refurbishment.

Prince William was born at 9.03pm on June 21, 1982, weighing 7lb 1.5oz in the same wing.

He made his public debut with his parents outside the hospital, wrapped in a white blanket carried in the arms of his mother Diana, with the Prince of Wales at their side.

Harry was born in the same exclusive wing just over two years later.

Calling Doctors Farthing and Setchell: The Royal delivery duo

The Queen’s current surgeon-gynaecologist Marcus Setchell, and Alan Farthing, the surgeon-gynaecologist to the royal household, are both playing key roles throughout Kate's pregnancy.

Mr Setchell will take the lead for Kate's delivery, assisted by Mr Farthing.

Consultant Mr Farthing, 47, is the former fiance of murdered television presenter Jill Dando and took up his role in the royal household in 2008. This is the first royal pregnancy since his appointment.

Mr Setchell, 69, treated Kate for her severe morning sickness last December.

Mr Setchell has been a royal surgeon-gynaecologist for 18 years and cared for Sophie, Countess of Wessex, delivering her two babies, Lady Louise Windsor, now nine, and Viscount Severn, four.

The Countess collapsed and was close to death when Lady Louise was born prematurely in 2003, after the placenta ruptured the lining of the womb.

Mr Setchell also led the medical care following her ectopic pregnancy in 2001.

He performed the Duchess of Cornwall’s hysterectomy in 2007 at the King Edward VII Hospital, where the Duchess of Cambridge was treated for her morning sickness.

In recognition of his work, the father-of-four was awarded a personal honour by the Queen in 2004 when he was made a Commander of the Royal Victorian Order.

When Mr Farthing took on his role for the royal household in 2008, he became one of the youngest doctors to treat the royal family.

He was reported to have met the Duchess last year after her wedding to Prince William.

Mr Farthing qualified as a doctor in 1986. He became a member of  the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists in 1991, and a fellow in 2003.

In 1997, he became a consultant gynaecologist at St Mary’s Hospital and an honorary senior lecturer at Imperial College, London.

He is a specialist in gynaecological cancer care and an internationally recognised expert in keyhole surgery.

Mr Farthing went on to open his own private Harley Street practice and works as a consultant at two teaching hospitals in London, Queen Charlotte’s in Shepherd’s Bush and St Mary’s.

Prince William and his brother Harry were delivered by Mr Setchell’s predecessor, the late Sir George Pinker, who delivered nine royal babies between 1973 and 1990.

Mr Farthing was engaged to Crimewatch presenter Miss Dando when she was murdered in 1999, five months before they were due to marry. The couple met at a dinner party in 1997 and announced their engagement in 1999.

Miss Dando was shot dead on  her doorstep in April that year  and her murder remains unsolved.
