Landmark case: Aja Riggs, of Santa Fe, New Mexico, challenged a decades-old state law that prohibits assisted suicide

Terminally ill patients who are competent have a fundamental right to get a doctor's help to end their lives under New Mexico's constitution, a judge has ruled.

Second Judicial District Judge Nan Nash said the constitution banned the state from depriving a person of life, liberty or property without due process.

'This court cannot envision a right more fundamental, more private or more integral to the liberty, safety and happiness of a New Mexican than the right of a competent, terminally ill patient to choose aid in dying,' she wrote.

Judge Nash also ruled that doctors 
could not be prosecuted under the state's assisted suicide law, which 
classifies helping with suicide as a fourth-degree felony.

The plaintiffs in the case do not consider physicians aiding in dying a form of suicide.

The
 judge's decision followed a two-day trial in December in which two 
doctors and a Santa Fe woman with advanced uterine cancer asked the 
judge to determine physicians would not be breaking the law if they 
wrote prescriptions for competent, terminally ill patients who wanted to
 end their lives.

Doctors Katherine Morris and Aroop Mangalik and patient Aja Riggs initially filed their lawsuit in March 2012.

The
 lawsuit had the support of the American Civil Liberties Union of New 
Mexico, Denver-based Compassion & Choices and the New Mexico 
Psychological Association, the largest organisation of professional 
psychologists in the state.

The psychologists' group argued that 
assisted suicide and 'aid in dying' for terminally ill patients were 
fundamentally different.

Ms Riggs, 49, who has undergone 
aggressive radiation and chemotherapy, said in December that her cancer 
was in remission but there had been days when getting out of bed and 
walking 15ft were an uphill battle.

She
 said she wanted to live, but also wanted the option of dying if her 
condition worsened. 'I don't want to suffer needlessly at the end,' she 
told Judge Nash.

A judge in New Mexico has ruled that patients have a right to ask doctor to help end their lives

Kathryn Tucker, director of legal affairs for Compassion & Choices, has said there is growing support for doctorss to help terminally ill patients who want to end their lives.

Five US states, including Oregon, allow patients to seek aid in dying if their conditions become unbearable, she said.

The New Mexico Conference of Catholic Bishops was disappointed with Monday's ruling, saying there's a difference between fundamental rights guaranteed by the constitution and the ability of someone to take a person's life.

Opinions can differ with regard to the survivability of illnesses, and medical treatments can progress, said Allen Sanchez, executive director of the bishops' group.

'As long as there is a chance for human error, we can't have that. You can never reverse the decision you've made. It's the finality of it,' Sanchez said.

'If we are not willing to give that ability to a judge and jury by doing away with the death penalty in New Mexico, we should not be willing to give one doctor and two witnesses that ability.'
