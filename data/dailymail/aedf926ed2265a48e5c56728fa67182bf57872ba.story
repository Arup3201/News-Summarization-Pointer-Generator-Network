We're about to see a lot more of tennis player and sporting heartthrob Rafael Nadal.

The Spanish 14-time Grand Slam winner has been announced as the new face and body of Tommy Hilger's underwear range.

Nadal, 28, has signed up as the fashion label's global brand ambassador in 2015 and will also appear in campaigns for its Tailored collection.

First look at Rafael Nadal as the new 2015 global ambassador for Tommy Hilfiger's Tailored collection

Nadal holds the record for his nine French Open victories but is also famous for his impressive physique

The designer chose Nadal because he's 'confident, fun and cool'.

Nadal  said: 'I've always admired Tommy Hilfiger's cool, all-American designs which are sophisticated and easy to wear, and I'm excited to be partnering with the brand.'

Yet this isn't the first time he's stripped off for fashion - Rafa showcased his chiseled physique as the face and body of Armani's underwear campaign in 2011.

He joined a growing club of sporting heroes posing in boxers and briefs in the name of fashion like David Beckham and Cristian Ronaldo.

Nadal's great on-court rival Roger Federer has yet to strip off for a fashion campaign, instead starring in ads for Rolex and Moet & Chandon.

And if the black and white teaser picture for the campaign proves anything it's that Rafa's legions of female fans are in for a treat.

One of tennis's greats, Rafael Nadal is the second male player in the world to have completed the Career Golden Slam, winning the French, Australian and U.S. Opens, Wimbledon and an Olympic gold medal

He oozes cool as he gazes nonchalantly into the camera wearing a light grey suit, darker open-necked shirt, his hair swept back from his face.

The full campaign imagery will be photographed in early 2015 in Nadal's home country of Spain. 

Tommy Hilfiger describes the new underwear range as featuring 'updated fits, revamped fabrics and elevated details' while the Autumn 2015 Tommy Hilfiger Tailored collection features 'sharp silhouettes, modern tailoring and rich textures'.

The designer said: 'Rafael Nadal has been a longtime personal friend and supporter of our brand, and I'm continuously inspired by his dedication and passion for his sport.

'This exclusive partnership brings one of the greatest athletes of this generation into our Tommy family. 

'Rafael embodies an effortless sense of style that exemplifies and reflects our brand spirit – he's confident, fun and cool.'
