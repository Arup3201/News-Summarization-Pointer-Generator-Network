Newcastle United players looked pleased with themselves as they returned to training the day after their Capital One Cup heroics at the Etihad against holders Manchester City.

Alan Pardew's side beat the reigning Premier League champions  2-0 on Wednesday night, thanks to goals from Rolando Aarons and Moussa Sissoko in either half.

The Tyneside outfit were given no time to rest, though, as Pardew had them preparing for the visit of Liverpool to St James' Park on Saturday.

Newcastle, having recently seen off Manchester City, Tottenham and Leicester City, will look to maintain their form against a Liverpool side struggling to pick up where they left off last season.

Pardew has  been beaten at home just once this season - in August against Manchester City - despite repeated calls for the Newcastle manager to be sacked by owner Mike Ashley.

Newcastle's opponents for Saturday's lunch-time match scraped past Swansea City on Tuesday night in the Capital One Cup at Anfield, courtesy of goals from Mario Balotelli and Dejan Lovren in the 86th and 95th minute respectively.

Last year's Premier League runners up sit seventh - nine points adrift of leaders Chelsea.
