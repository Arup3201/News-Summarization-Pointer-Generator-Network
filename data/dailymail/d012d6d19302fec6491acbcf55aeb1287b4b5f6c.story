When Kate and William prepared to attend the Royal premiere of a film chronicling the remarkable life of Nelson Mandela yesterday evening they could not have known the significance the evening would come to hold.

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were the very image of elegance as arrived on the red carpet yesterday, Kate in her bespoke ivory Roland Mouret gown and a £19.99 Zara necklace; William in black tie.

But as the two watched the film, alongside the Zindzi Mandela, daughter of the South African leader, news came in that 95-year-old Mandela had died peacefully at home.

For Kate, who has grown accustomed to living her life on the world's stage, this was a moment she could not have prepared for, but she handled it with dignity.

Smiles turned to tears as the news spread throughout the theatre and a night that was to have been a celebration of this great leader's life was suddenly marked with tragedy.

The ashen-faced duchess maintained her composure as William paid tribute to this great leader and his extraordinary achievements, expressing his condolences to the Mandela family.

Clearly distressed by the news, a subdued Kate and William left the premiere shortly after the film had ended, sadness etched on their faces as they were driven away from the theatre in London's Leicester Square.

Mandela's daughter Zindzi was informed of the passing of her father but insisted the screening go ahead.

Fellow audience members were not told until after the movie when the film's producer, Anant Singh, got up on stage and announced
 the 'sad news'.

Poignant: The Royals were seen leaving the premiere after hearing the news of Mandela's death. Prince William had told reporters: 'I just wanted to say it's extremely sad and tragic news'

The news, which was revealed on television in an address to the nation by South Africa's current president, Jacob Zuma,  was then passed on to stunned guests after the credits had rolled. A two minute silence was then held in the West End cinema.

Speaking from the Odeon Leicester Square, Prince William said: 'I just wanted to say it's extremely sad and tragic news.

'We
 were just reminded what an extraordinary and inspiring man Nelson 
Mandela was. My thoughts and prayers are with him and his family. It's 
very sad.'

The Royal couple looked ashen-faced 
as they walked down the stairs into the foyer. Shortly after they left, 
shocked members of the audience began emerging from the cinema, in 
silence at first.

Speaking 
before the screening of Mandela: Long Walk To Freedom, Ms Mandela said 
her father was doing well, when asked about his health.

She said: 'My father is fine. He's 95 years old and he is pretty frail. We are hoping to see more of him.'

Speaking to the Mail before the 
screening, Zindzi said of the film: 'It's something that makes me feel 
really proud, what my family went through and the role my father played 
has been recognised. It is a reward [for him].'

'When we document our history in this
 manner we do it not just for ourselves but also for the future 
generations, young people that my father is really passionate about.'

Some in the audience burst into tears, while others sat in stunned silence, according to witnesses.

The
 cast, whose after-show party was promptly cancelled, were too upset to 
speak. In the foyer, security men surrounded Naomie Harris, who plays 
his wife, Winnie, as she walked slowly past, head down and close to 
tears.

John Battersby, 65, a
 South African journalist who knew Mandela personally and wrote the 
afterword to his authorised biography said: 'My daughter told me just 
before the announcement.

'Apparently
 he died half an hour before the film started. My phone was buzzing in 
my pocket but I just thought "who is calling me in the Mandela 
premiere?" In the protection of the darkness I shed a few tears.

'He was brilliantly portrayed in the film, what came through was the dignity.'

His daughter Anna said: 'I think it's very fitting that we were all here paying tribute to him at the moment of his passing.'

Starring British actor Idris Elba, 
'Mandela' follows the iconic anti-apartheid leader’s extraordinary life 
from childhood through to his 27-year imprisonment on Robben Island and,
 finally, his inauguration as the first democratically elected President
 of South Africa in 1994.

Another British actress, Skyfall’s Naomie Harris, plays the politician’s controversial wife, Winnie.

The
 film itself, which has been 16 years in the making, has received mixed 
reviews from critics, but Elba, who is best known for his role as a 
detective chief inspector in the hit TV series Luther, has been praised 
as ‘towering’ and ‘Oscar-worthy’.

Speaking
 on the red carpet last night he told Mail Online: 'Everyone knows who 
Mandela is, everyone has an idea of what he sounds and looks like. I 
worked really hard to pull in all the elements, from the sound of his 
voice to the way he walks. I don't look anything like him but it was 
really important the audience got a sense of who Mandela is because the 
likelihood is that we will never meet him in person.

The death of former South African president Nelson Mandela was announced during the UK premiere of a film about his life

On Wednesday his daughter, Makaziwe 
Mandela, insisted he was ‘still with us, strong, courageous’ but 
admitted for the first time that he was on his 'deathbed’.

'Even
 for a lack of a better word... on his deathbed he is teaching us 
lessons - lessons in patience, in love, lessons of tolerance,’ she 
added.

'Every moment I get with him I'm amazed.

'There
 are times where I have to pinch myself that I come from this man who is
 a fighter even though you can see he is struggling, but the fighting 
spirit is still there with him.'

Zindzi
 Mandela, speaking before the start of the film, said: 'It's something 
that makes me feel really proud, what my family went through and the 
role my father played has been recognised. It is a reward [for him].

'When
 we document our history in this manner we do it not just for ourselves 
but also for the future generations, young people that my father is 
really passionate about.

'He has seen clips of the film and said he saw [Idris] that he thought it was him.'

She
 added: 'When my 11 year-old grandson saw the movie last week I asked 
him what did he thought and he said 'the dude who played grandad when he
 talks he kind of reminds me of him'.

'I said: 'What about the lady who play big mammy? [Winnie Mandela]. He said: 'That chick, I think she's hot!''

Each
 year the Royal Film Performance is staged to raise funds for the Cinema
 and Television Benevolent Fund, which supports industry employees and 
their families in times of hardship.

As well as the film’s director and cast, the Duke and Duchess will meet a selection of the film’s trustees and beneficiaries.

Also
 benefitting from this year’s event is The Nelson Mandela Children’s 
Fund, which works with the disadvantaged youth of South Africa.
