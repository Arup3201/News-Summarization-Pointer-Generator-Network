A hacker has accessed private photos and emails sent 
between members of the Bush family, including pictures of the 43rd president showing off his painting skills.

Two of the works believed to be painted by former President George W. Bush, show the former Commander-in-Chief in the bathroom.

In one, he is painted showering with only 
his back visible, with a reflection of his face painted onto what 
looks like a shaving mirror. A second painting that Bush sent to his sister illustrated him in the bathtub with only his legs and his toes visible.

A third photograph shows the son of former President George H.W. Bush in his gym, working on a painting of what appears to be a historic stone church.

A criminal investigation is now underway. The Smoking Gun says the hacker went 
by the online moniker 'Guccifer,' a word plastered across the leaked 
photos - which include an picture of George H.W. Bush in the hospital in December -  in translucent, neon blue print. MailOnline will not be publishing any of the images that were hacked.

A criminal investigation is under way after a hacker apparently accessed private photos and emails sent between members of the Bush family, including both former presidents

NBC News correspondent Janet Shamlian tweeted this photo of former president George H.W. Bush on February 4, 2013 with the text, 'President George H.W. Bush out to dinner Saturday night in Houston, first since hospitalization'

The Smoking Gun says the hacker went 
by the online moniker 'Guccifer,' a word plastered across the leaked 
photos - which include an picture of George H.W. Bush in the hospital in December -  in translucent, neon blue print. MailOnline will not be publishing any of the images that were hacked.

The website quotes 'Guccifer' as describing himself as a veteran hacker who has long been in the government's sights.

A spokesman for former President George H. W. Bush declined to comment on The Smoking Gun report detailing the alleged security breach.

Bush spokesman Jim McGrath told the Houston Chronicle the matter is 'under criminal investigation.'

Included in the hacked material is a list of home addresses cell phone numbers and e-mails for dozens of Bush family members.

The hacker also apparently accessed at least half a dozen e-mail accounts, including the account of Dorothy Bush Koch, George W. Bush's sister, and CBS sportscaster Jim Nantz, a longtime Bush family friend.

One e-mail between George W. Bush and Nantz included the Dallas street address for the former president and the four-digit code needed to enter a security gate.

Another email revealed that George 
H.W. Bush was so sick in December that his 'funeral team' was planning 
an emergency meeting and that George W. Bush was 'thinking about his [father's]
eulogy.'

'Hopefully I’m jumping the gun,' 
George W. Bush wrote. 'But since the feeling is that you all would 
rather me speak than bubba, please help.' 'Bubba' refers to Clinton, who
has a close relationship with George H.W. Bush.

In a December 27 e-mail to his four siblings, Jeb Bush saluted his father’s 'kindness and good nature' and discussed 'how kind he was with President Clinton and he helped restore his sordid reputation. A very tough thing to do but with kindness, dad probably helped Bill Clinton than anything he himself has done.'

While George H.W. Bush was in the hospital, Valerie Jarrett, an adviser to President Obama, forwarded a personal message from the First Couple. The message said: 'Michelle and I haven’t wanted to impinge on you while you are recuperating, but please know that we are thinking of you and the entire family.'

Emails also revealed that Fox News’ Brit Hume was disappointed by 
the 2012 election results. In a Nov. 9 email to Willard Heminway, a 
close friend of the elder bush, the Fox News analyst wrote: 'Election 
outcome disappointing, but there are many silver linings.'

Photographs stolen from the email accounts include George H.W. Bush pictured with Clinton at the Bush family compound in Maine, George W. Bush posing next to a cardboard cutout of himself and George W. Bush sitting on a couch with designer Ralph Lauren.
