George Galloway converted to Islam in a secret ceremony more than a decade ago, socialite Jemima Khan claimed today.

The maverick MP took part in a 'shahadah' conversion, attended by members of the Muslim Association of Great Britain, she said.

Jemima Khan, who herself became a Muslim ahead of her failed marriage to cricketer Imran Khan, claimed she knows someone who attended the event in north-west London in an article in the New Statesman magazine.

But Mr Galloway, who was elected to Parliament as MP for Bradford West in a by-election last month, angrily denied that any ceremony had taken place.

War of words: Jemima Khan, right, wrote that George Galloway, right, converted to Islam in a secret ceremony more than a decade ago. He has denied ever taking part in such a ceremony

However, the four times married 57-year-old refused to deny claims that he is a Muslim.

In the media, Mr Galloway has always been widely referred to as a Catholic.

In the days before his shock landslide by-election victory last month, a letter - which Mr Galloway denies being behind - went out to voters highlighting his record of support for Palestine, his work for 'the freedom of Kashmir' and his abstention from alcohol.

It added: 'God knows who is a Muslim. And He knows who is not. Instinctively so do you.'

Elected: Bradford West MP George Galloway takes his seat in the House of Commons earlier this month for the first time after winning a by-election

Ms
Khan, who interviewed the MP in his new constituency, which has a large
Muslim community, started the article: 'George Galloway, MP for 
Bradford West, is a Muslim.

'He
converted more than ten years ago in a ceremony at a hotel in Kilburn, 
north-west London, attended by members of the Muslim Association of 
Great Britain.

'Those close to him know this. The rest of the world, including his Muslim constituents, does not.'

Claims: Jemima Khan's allegations were published in the New Statesman magazine today

Ms Khan tells Mr Galloway she knows someone 'who attended your shahadah' and says, 'so you converted?'

According to the article he replied: 'I can't answer that. God knows who is a Muslim.'

The interview was carried out as Ms Khan and Mr Galloway ate a halal meal.

When being sworn in as an MP Mr Galloway chose to affirm, rather than make the pledge on a religious text.

He told Ms Khan: 'People ask me this, why did I affirm in Parliament when I swore in?

'The answer is: I had to take an oath of allegiance in which I don't believe, to the Queen and all her heirs and successors, and I have no allegiance to any of them, and I could not possibly swear such a thing on a holy book.

'So nothing else should be read into the affirmation.'

Mr Galloway claimed today the article was littered with 'deliberate falsehoods' and 'schoolgirl howlers'.

He Tweeted: 'No such ceremony ever happened, in Kilburn or anywhere else.'

In
a statement he added: 'The opening paragraph of Jemima Khan's piece in 
the New Statesman, referring to an alleged conversion ceremony, is 
totally untrue.

'Moreover I 
told her it was fallacious when she put it to me. I have never attended 
any such ceremony in Kilburn, Karachi or Kathmandu.

'It is simply and categorically untrue.'

The New Statesman issued a robust statement in response to Mr Galloway's denial.

A
spokeswoman said: 'It is notable that Galloway does not deny being a 
Muslim convert - and he did not deny it when it was put to him at the 
time of the interview, which is on tape.

'Contrary
to his press release, nor did he deny that the ceremony took place when
it was put to him during the interview. This is also on tape.

'Furthermore,
he failed to clarify how, by his own admission, he had a 'nikah' (a 
Muslim marriage ceremony), despite the fact that a non-Muslim man cannot
marry a Muslim woman under Islamic law.'

Confusion: George Galloway, pictured outside the Houses of Parliament with his new wife Putri Gayatri Pertiwi, has denied taking part in a Muslim conversion ceremony - but apparently not denied being a Muslim
