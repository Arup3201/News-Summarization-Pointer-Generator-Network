A single mother with nowhere to turn found help in the most unlikely of places when her nurse agreed to raise her son after she passed away.

Tricia Somers, 45, of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, has terminal liver cancer and needed someone to look after her eight-year-old son Wesley after she passed.

Enter her nurse, Tricia Seaman, a mom with four children of her own.

Chance encounter: Nurse Tricia Seaman (above) was shocked when Somers asked her to raise Wesley

The two ladies met when Seaman cared for Somers after she underwent diagnostic tests at Pinnacle Health's Community General campus in Harrisburg.

The day before she was set to be discharged, Somers dropped a bombshell when she asked the nurse to take in her son.

'She said, "If I die will you raise my son?"' recalled Seaman. 

Somers' parents died years ago, and she felt no one in her family was capable of caring for her son.

Seaman admits she was stunned, but quickly agreed after talking things over with her husband Daniel, who felt they should do all they could to help the young boy and his mother.

As luck should have it, Seaman and her family had actually been in the process of becoming foster parents  and were already approved to be adoptive parents.

New family: Wesley and his mom soon began spending more time with the Seaman family

Soon, Somers and her son were spending time with the Seamans and their three teenage daughters and 10-year-old son. 

Then, after Somers underwent chemotherapy, she and her son officially moved from their apartment into the Seamans' home.

'At one point I said, "I can't be your nurse anymore. I'm your family now,"' Seaman said in an interview with ABC News.

'I talked to her and said I want you to come [home]. She kind of fell apart and cried. She said, "I'd love to."'

Closer than ever: The Somers officially moved in with the Seaman family in May of this year

That was in May, and doctors said Somers had a month left, but she is still going, and now she knows her son is in the best of hands.

'We just want to Trish to live life to the fullest and ... we love her and love Wesley,' said Seaman. 

'He's a very smart little boy. We want to see him get an education and be successful and know that he's not alone. He has a family. He's not going to be all by himself.'
