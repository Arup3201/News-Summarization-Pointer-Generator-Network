Barcelona's fixtures for the 2014-15 La Liga season have been revealed and the list unearths a number of potential plot twists.

The La Liga giants will welcome new £75million striker Luis Suarez back on October 26 after his four-month ban for biting Italy's Giorgio Chiellini at the World Cup - the same day they play rivals Real Madrid at the Bernabeu.

Barcelona will also face Atletico Madrid as the season draws to its finale - just as they did last year when Diego Simeone's men won the title by leaving the Nou Camp with a point.

New boy: Luis Suarez swapped Liverpool for Barcelona this summer in a £75million move

Big draw: Barca fans will be keen to see their new man in action against their fierce rivals

Eager: Talisman Lionel Messi will be pivotal to Barcelona's La Liga title hopes this year

Ready, Lionel? Messi will take on Real Madrid in the El Clasico on October 26 and March 22

Manager Luis Enrique will hope Barcelona have the title wrapped up by that point, and that such a tense finale isn't needed.

Barcelona's season starts at the Nou Camp against Elche, a side that dodged relegation by a point and finished 16th last year. It ends with Deportivo, also at home.
