A Bollywood star has been leading a double life - as a customer services officer at Oxfordshire County Council.

Sonia Gill, 27, is a poster girl in India, where she has starred in five blockbusters - as well as fashion shoots, TV commercials and soap adverts.

But despite her increasing fame abroad, she refuses to ditch her regular 9-to-5 job at home in Oxford.

Star: The Oxford-born actress has starred in five movies after being scouted at university in Buckinghamshire

At the council, she works on the Blue Badge team - processing applications and issuing parking badges for people with mobility problems.

And any film parts she gets will have to wait until she gets a holiday. 

She said: 'I actually enjoy both jobs. I enjoy working at the council - the people are really nice. I like talking to people so working in customer services, that’s an advantage.

'I love everything about India and I have really good friends over there. The weather is great and the lifestyle is really good.

'It’s totally different to here - I have someone doing my cooking and cleaning. But coming back to the UK brings me back to reality. It keeps me grounded.

'It’s actually quite good for me because I’m quite a private person.'

Sonia's career began when a scout spotted photos of her on Facebook while she was a Law student at Buckinghamshire New University in High Wycombe, which lead to her modelling in Asian bridal magazines.

Secret: Sonia has yet to tell colleagues she flies all over the world for films like Let's Play The Game (pictured)

Work: She spent two months intensively learning Hindi and now gets offered lead roles in romantic comedies

At 22, she was offered a role in Let’s Play The Game and she flew to New York and New Jersey to shoot the Indian film.

Later, she was offered roles in Mumbai, including television adverts and fashion shows, before starring in movie Society.

And last December she spent six weeks shooting romantic comedy Arsho in the Punjab region of India, which has recently been released in UK cinemas.

Incredibly, she even learned Hindi.

'I did it in a couple of months. I just converse with the locals but I still have a British accent so that works against me.

'But every time I come back people say I have an Indian accent!'

She added: 'I usually go to India for six months and do a lot of modelling and acting and the other six months I’m usually here because my family are here.

'I’m pretty well known over there because I do a lot of TV commercials and I’m the face of a soap called Santoor.'

And Sonia has even kept her alter ego a secret from her co-workers.

'Nobody at work knows what I do, well they didn’t until now,' she said.

'They’re quite excited. They had no idea. I was hiding it so it was quite a shock for them. I didn’t really want the attention because I’m quite shy.'  

She added: 'When we do dancing we have a lot of rehearsals. It’s quite tough. I’m not an experienced dancer but I love to dance.

'You get to do all sorts of different dances - one day you’re doing jazz, then you’re doing contemporary then Bollywood.'

But despite her anonymity here, Sonia took her friends and family to watch her in action on the big screen.

'I just had a movie released two weeks ago called Arsho,' she said. 'My family and I watched if together in Leicester Square.

'My family and friends were really excited - they were shouting and screaming in the screen. They were pretty impressed. I don’t think they expected much from me!'
