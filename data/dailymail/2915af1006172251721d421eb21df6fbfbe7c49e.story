From the Leaning Tower of Pisa to the crumbling Mayan step-pyramids at Tikal, some of the most precious heritage sites around the globe are at risk from forces of nature and humans.

But now scientists are using advanced 3D scanning technology to digitally document much-loved landmarks in a bid to preserve them on computers for generations to come.

A new organisation intends to preserve 500 cultural sites digitally over the next five years and build a 3D-digital library of the world's most important monuments.

Unlike precious artefacts that are carefully preserved in museums, sites such as the Mayan pyramids, Mount Rushmore and the ruins of Pompeii, are open to the elements and are being slowly eroded.

Increasing numbers of tourists visiting the famous sites can also accidentally cause damage to them, leading a new charitable organisation to try and preserve selected locations.

Launched today at the Tower of London, CyArk's '500 Challenge' is a mission to save cultural heritage sites across the globe before they are ravaged by war or terrorism, affected by climate change, earthquakes or floods or fall victim to sprawling cities.

Mapping the sites is a laborious process. Here, abseilers map Mount Rushmore, which forms one of the 40 heritage sites mapped and collected by the organisation so far

CyArk intends to preserve 500 cultural sites digitally over the next five years and build a 3D-digital library of the world's most important sites. This is a scan of Chichen Itza in Mexico that dates from 600 AD. The precious pyramid is visited by 1.2 million tourists every year

The project uses 3D laser scanning and other reality-capture technologies to create digital models of sites, such as this ancient Stabiae in Pompeii, that are accurate to just two to six millimeters. This level of detail preserves delicate works of art such as mosaic floor (pictured)

Ben Kacyra, co-founder of CyArk, based in Edinburgh, said: 'Our mission is to create a 3D-digital library of the world’s most important heritage sites.

'While there isn’t enough time or money to save all these sites physically, we have the technology to digitally preserve them.

'By
doing so, we will ensure that these treasures are available for 
appreciation and study for years to come. It’s not an option; it’s our 
responsibility.

'Otherwise, we will lose our shared history and an important piece of our cultural identity.'

CyArk has already mapped 40 sites, including Babylon, the Titanic, the Sydney Opera House and the Tower of London.

The project uses 3D laser scanning and other reality-capture technologies to create digital models of the sites that are accurate to just two to six millimeters, enabling details to be captured that could otherwise be damaged by weathering.

This scan of the Leaning Tower of Pisa shows just how precarious the monument is. The organisation is scanning 500 landmarks to make sure they are available to study for years to come and sees its as a responsibility

In each mapping exercise, experts capture billions of data points and as much as 10 terbytes of information.

Using
the data collected, CyArk develops tools to help conservators in 
managing and preserving locations, that can be a magnet for tourists, as 
well as letting researchers and members of the public have access to the
maps via its website.

The data collected from each project is stored in an underground bunker in western Pennsylvania by a company called Iron Mountain, alongside other priceless collections including musical recordings from Capitol/Universal Music musicians such as Frank Sinatra and Elvis Presley and films like E.T and Jaws from Universal Studios.

The organisation today launched the CyArk 500 Fund to enable governments and individuals to nominate sites for preservation and donate money to support the cause.

Sites worthy of scanning will be chosen by a council of international heritage experts, chaired by Gustavo Araoz, president of the International Council of Monuments and Sites.

He said: 'The first task of the Advisory Council was to develop criteria for selecting the 500.

'While the risk factor will be a chief criterion in selecting sites, we want to use the technology beyond mere documentation to promote capacity building in all regions, and to assist management in periodic monitoring, interpretation, public awareness, and promotion of visitation.'

In each mapping exercise, such as this colonnade in Pompeii, experts capture billions of data points and as much as 10 terbytes of information
