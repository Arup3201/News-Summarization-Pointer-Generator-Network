Visitors took full advantage of yesterday's warm and sunny weather to marvel at the UK's largest laburnum arch.

The huge floral canopy can be found at Bodnant Garden in Conwy, North Wales, with the damp weather meaning it is expected to bloom for far longer than its usual two weeks this year.

But those wanting to visit the attraction are encouraged to enjoy it while the good weather lasts, as forecasters are warning that the worst hailstorms to hit the UK for 170 years are likely to arrive this weekend.

Magnificent: The 55-metre long floral canopy can be found at Bodnant Garden in Conwy, North Wales. Last year Bodnant Garden was voted the winner of 'The National Trust Gardens Award' by National Trust members and visitors to the tourist attraction

Awe: Families made the most of yesterday's glorious weather to visit the UK's largest laburnum arch at Bodnant Garden in Wales. The damp spring we have just experienced means the flowers are likely to bloom until July - several weeks longer than it would in drier conditions

History: Bodnant Garden was created by successive generations of the McLaren family, but was primarily the creation of the 2nd Lord Aberconway who gave it to the National Trust in 1949. It has been open to members of the public ever since

Just when you thought it was safe to dust
 off the barbecue and put on your sun hat, forecasters have stepped 
forward to pour cold water on weekend plans.

They are predicting thunder and lightning, torrential rain, the chance of flooding and some of the worst hailstorms for 170 years.

The were no such concerns for the families who visited Bodnant Garden however, as they made the most of yesterday's glorious weather to visit the UK's largest laburnum arch.

The arch is 55 metres long and, as its flowers are currently in full bloom, presents a magnificent yellow canopy under which guests can walk.

The colourful display is short-lived however, usually lasting only a few weeks in late May and early June - although experts predict that the damp spring  we have just experienced may cause the flowers to bloom until July this year.

Taking a stroll: Despite looking incredibly attractive, all parts of the laburnum plant are poisonous, and can be lethal if consumed in excess

Although the blooms may last until June, it is highly unlikely the warm weather will.

Forecasters have issued severe weather warnings for most of the UK this Saturday, with heavy rain predicted alongside thunderstorms and ‘intense’ hail.

Twister tornado-like cloud formations were even spotted snaking their way across fields over Lincolnshire yesterday.

A
 Met Office spokesman said they would have been funnel clouds. ‘They are
 the first stages of a tornado, created by low pressure, but because 
they do not reach the ground they don’t become tornadoes,’ he added.

‘We
 do get the occasional tornado in the UK which is where a funnel cloud 
touches the ground. We have had sightings of these clouds this week and 
last week in the UK.'

The calm before the storm: Those wanting to lap up the last rays of sunshine before a weekend of predicted storms took advantage of high temperatures yesterday at Brighton beach, Sussex

Parts of the country, particularly around the south coast, including Sussex as above, basked in glorious sunshine yesterday - the last day of expected sunshine until next week

They may be an indication of the conditions to come with two weather fronts set to collide over the UK tomorrow. Warm high pressure is due to sweep in from Europe today but it will clash with a low pressure ridge heading in from the Atlantic in the south west.

The result will be torrential rain as well as hailstones, brisk winds and thunderstorms across large parts of the country for much of Saturday.

The Met Office has already issued a yellow severe weather warning for the whole of  England and Wales, which will also cover southern parts of Scotland. A spokesman said: ‘Warm, humid air will be pulled northwards from France and Spain late on Friday and during Saturday.

‘Within this air mass, there is an increasing likelihood of heavy, thundery downpours breaking out.

‘Heavy, thundery rain is expected to affect parts of the UK on Saturday.

‘The
 public should be aware of the potential for localised flooding due to 
the intensity of these downpours although at this stage the location of 
the heaviest rainfall remains uncertain.’

With grey clouds seen over the skies this week, coupled with warm temperatures, the Met Office has issued a yellow severe weather warning for the whole of England and Wales, and parts of southern Scotland, for Saturday

John Griffiths of the forecast company MeteoGroup said: ‘It is going to be very unsettled on Saturday with the chance of torrential rain and severe thunder and hailstorms.

'These are going to sweep up the UK from the South West heading towards the North East and into southern Scotland and will be quite lively in places.’

However, he said, conditions will improve as the storm front passes. Sunday will be a lot brighter with the beginning of next week improving further.

Last month the Shard in London – western Europe’s tallest building – was struck by lightning during a thunderstorm.

A
 study by the Met Office and Newcastle University earlier this week 
warned that climate change could result in heavier summer rainfall in 
Britain, which in turn could increase the risk of flash flooding.

The
 worst hailstorm ever recorded in Britain struck in August 9 1843, 
causing huge craters and widespread injuries across central and southern
 England.

The storm caused 
so much damage that a brand new insurance company, the General Hail 
Insurance Company – later known as Norwich Union – was set up.
