Three Lions supporters voted with their feet on Wednesday night with 50,000 empty seats at Wembley for England's friendly against Norway.

And audience figures would suggest fans staged a protest with their television remote, too.

While the BBC's The Great British Bake Off raked in over 8 million viewers, England's drab performance against Norway managed to pull in only half that number.

Indeed just 4.5 million tuned in to watch Roy Hodgson's side record a slender 1-0 victory over Norway.

Soggy display: Wednesday night's The Great British Bake Off attracted more viewers than England's win

Wayne Rooney scored a second-half penalty to ensure England claimed their first win in six games, but it was a largely dreary performance from Hodgson’s side.

In their first game since the World Cup shambles, where England’s stay at the tournament lasted just two games, the brave 40,000 who turned up at Wembley would have been hoping for an improved display from England's alleged new era. But they were treated to a largely lifeless performance.

The Football Association has accepted that it has work to do to regain supporters' trust after the disappointment of the World Cup, and has arranged high-profile friendlies against world champions Germany, Spain, Italy and France over the next two years to try to drum up interest, especially with a fairly hum-drum Euro 2016 qualifying group.

Empty seats: Only 40,000 supporters turned up to watch England face Norway in Wednesday's friendly 

Football Association general secretary Alex Horne said last week: 'We have got some work to do, we have to rebuild a squad which is Roy Hodgson's department, and we have got to rebuild some trust with the supporters.'

England played Norway with the top tier closed due to low ticket sales - a record low for an England game at the new Wembley but the attendance of 40,181 was slightly better than the FA had been fearing.

The FA says it will be the best part of a decade before it can consider taking England games to other stadiums around the country as it needs the income from Wembley to pay off the stadium's debt.
