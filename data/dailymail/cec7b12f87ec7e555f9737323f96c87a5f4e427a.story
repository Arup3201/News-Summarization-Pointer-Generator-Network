A hilarious blunder at a company producing World Cup merchandise has seen Barack Obama mistaken for England defender Chris Smalling on a set of World Cup mugs.

The U.S. President is pictured wearing the England football top after a junior member of staff was tasked with finding royalty free images of the Three Lions squad.

The head and shoulders photo printed on the mugs show Obama wearing the kit, with the caption 'Chris Smalling World Cup squad Brazil 2014' beneath it.

Squad player: Chris Smalling has not started either any of England's first two World Cup matches

Roy Hodgson's England side crashed out of the Brazil World Cup in the group stages after losing their first two matches by a scoreline to 2-1 to both Italy and Uruguay.

It is the Three Lions' earliest World Cup exit since 1958 and, perhaps most humiliatingly, they still have to play Costa Rica in a dead rubber match on Tuesday.

The merchandise company which made the 
error has now hastily turned to Dorset-based expert clearance resellers Wholesale Clearance UK to try and shift the stock that could have easily
 appeared in an Only Fools and Horses episode.

Wholesale Clearance managing director Karl Baxter said the company contacted him with the hope of off-loading the stock.

Mr Baxter said he believed a junior member of staff at the Dorset company responsible could be facing demotion after being trusted with the task of sourcing royalty free pictures of each England player to use on the mugs.

He said: 'They passed 
this onto to their young, bright eyed and bushy tailed new apprentice.

'The designs were proofed and signed off by their boss, who had clearly 
had a heavy night with the lads playing poker and before he'd had his 
first vat of coffee the following morning.

'They
 immediately contacted us and 2,000 of the England items were dispatched 
to our warehouse. We eagerly unpacked them and, indeed it turned out 
that the Chris Smalling cup had Barack Obama's head on instead of Chris'.'
