Sad loss: Just two days after qualifying for her third Olympic appearance, Erin Hamlin is now mourning the loss of her grandmother, 75-year-old Joan Hamlin of Remse, who was killed in a car accident

The grandmother of U.S. Olympic Luge team member Erin Hamlin has been killed in a car crash less than two days after her granddaughter qualified for the Winter Olympics.

The Oneida County Sheriff's Office says 75-year-old Joan Hamlin of Remsen, New York, was a passenger in a car that went out of control Monday morning on an ice and slush-covered road in the town of Trenton.

Deputies say the car crashed head-on with an oncoming vehicle.

Mrs Hamlin was pronounced dead at the 
scene, while the driver – Nancy Herrick, 78, of Remsen was transferred 
to University Hospital in Syracuse to be treated for multiple injuries, 
sheriff's Sgt. Matthew Bauer said.

Herrick
was driving west on Route 365 between the intersections of Korber and 
Mapledale roads shortly before 10 a.m. when her vehicle slid on ice into the 
oncoming lane and collided head on with a vehicle driven by David Eaton,
60, of the town of Ohio, Bauer said.

Herrick and Hamlin had to be extricated from the vehicle by fire personnel using hydraulic equipment, Bauer said.

Herrick
was treated at the scene by members of the Barneveld and Holland Patent
fire departments before first being taken to St. Elizabeth Medical 
Center, and then Syracuse, Bauer said.

Eaton was treated at the scene for minor 
injuries and declined medical transport, Bauer said.

The driver of the second car in the collision was also killed.

New York state 
troopers assisted at the scene, and the highway was closed for more than
five hours as deputies re-constructed the accident, Bauer said.
