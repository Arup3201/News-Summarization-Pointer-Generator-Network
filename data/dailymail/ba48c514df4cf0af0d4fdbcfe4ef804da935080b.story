A leukemia-stricken 6-year-old boy whose family was displaced after Superstorm Sandy struck was back in his Long Island home Saturday after it was rebuilt by hundreds of volunteers.

The house in Amityville has a new, extra bedroom so Steven Heckman doesn't have to share space with two sisters while he undergoes chemotherapy for leukemia.

The walls are painted a bright, cheery yellow and there is a mural of Indiana Jones - Steven's all-time favorite character - painted on one wall.

His tearful mother, Danielle Heckman, said she was so excited she was hyperventilating as the family moved in on Saturday morning.

Hope: Steven Heckman, 6, who was battling leukemia, now has a new room in the home rebuilt by volunteers after Sandy destroyed his family's first house

Before: The Heckman family's modest Amityville home was unlivable after it was flooded by the waters from Superstorm Sandy

After: The house has been completely remolded, and an extra bedroom added

'It was just really an incredible feeling — to walk in the door this morning and see that not only has the house been rebuilt, but it's also been furnished, literally from rugs to dressers, TVs and curtains,' Danielle Heckman told the Associated Press.

The October 29 superstorm flooded the family's home and destroyed almost all they owned. 

To make matters worse, they did not have the money to purchase flood insurance because of Steven’s escalating medical costs.

For months, they were forced to couch-surf, including a stint with the parents and three children sleeping on a queen-sized air mattress.

'The kids were very stressed out; they lost everything they had,' their mother said.

The bigger worry was to keep her son away from people with colds or other ailments. An infection could have landed him in the hospital. In addition, mold from the sodden home could also be risky for Steven.

A family's joy: The Heckman family had been at Disney World as part of Steven's wish from the Make A Wish Foundation; they first saw the new house upon their return on Saturday

The family’s finances also played a factor. Mrs Heckman had to quit her job to look after Steven after he was diagnosed with leukemia over the summer; Mr Heckman is unemployed, according to the New York Post.

The National Association of the Remodeling Industry, a not-for-profit trade group, heard about the family's plight and offered to rebuild the house with a team of volunteers. 

Retailers donated new interior furnishings, appliances, and dishware. The family now has a beautiful new kitchen, dining area, and more importantly, a roof over their heads.

In addition, a new bedroom was built for the two Heckman girls, Alexa, aged nine, and three-year-old Juliana, leaving Steven his own room.

been rebuilt, but it's also been furnished.

In total, the association paid for $150,000 worth of damage.

‘I thought it was going to take us six months, maybe even a year, and to have this and to have all these people here just helping is incredible,’ she told CBS New York.

The family had been in Disney World, courtesy of the Make a Wish Foundation, and returned to the fully-furnished new home, according to the Post. 

The foundation had agreed to fly them ahead of Sandy.

However, little Steven isn’t in the clear yet – the boy has two more years of chemotherapy to go.
