A young female motorcycle racer learned a valuable lesson at the weekend after she started celebrating before the end of the race and paid the ultimate price when she fell off her bike and embarrassingly lost.

Meghan Rutledge, 18, was comfortably leading the Women’s Moto X 12-lap race at the X Games in Los Angeles on Saturday night when she inexplicably started to pump her right fist during a jump just before the final corner of the race.

Unfortunately for young Meghan, taking her hand of the bike caused her to lose control and as the bike nosedived she landed awkwardly allowing her rival to steal the lead.

When the event finished it was arch rival Vicki Golden who took gold for the third year in a row, while a clearly deflated Rutledge was left with mascara-stained tears streaming down her face.

‘From the pinnacle of joy to the depths of defeat,’ an announcer said of the devastated rider.

After the race, Rutledge – who took silver - admitted her overconfidence had been her downfall but said she would learn from her big mistake.  

‘I was out there leading. I’m really young. I’ve never led an X Games before. I celebrated a bit too early and made a mistake, unfortunately, which gave Vicki Golden an opening to take first again,’ the Australian rider told ESPN.

‘If I had stayed on the bike, there was no way I could have lost. I had one straight to go. But, you know, mistakes happen.’
