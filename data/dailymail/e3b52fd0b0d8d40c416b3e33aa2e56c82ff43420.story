A Virginia math teacher already charged with having sex with a 17-year-old boy she taught has now admitted to sleeping with as many as four students. 

Erica Mesa, 27, was slapped Tuesday with three charges stemming from a sexual relationship she had with a student at Colonial Forge High School in Stafford, authorities said.

In court documents, investigators now say she has admitted to having sexual encounters with four students ages 16 to 18, WJLA reported. 

Most of the trysts allegedly happened in Mesa's home in nearby Fredericksburg, while one of the incidents happened in her SUV.

Two of the students confirmed they'd had sex with the married geometry teacher, according to the station.

Workplace scandal: Mesa allegedly met her underage lover at Colonial Forge High School, where both she and her husband worked as teachers 

Officials at the high school were tipped off by anonymous phone call informing them that the geometry and statistics teacher allegedly had sex with a male student in February, May and September.

An investigation revealed that the male student was 16 years old when the relationship began last winter. 

Investigators also found out that Mesa allegedly sent nude photos of herself to her underage lover using her cell phone.

The math teacher has worked at Colonial Forge High School since 2009. She has been placed on administrative leave.

Her husband of two years, Keith Mesa, works at Colonial Forge as a social studies teacher and head volleyball coach. Mesa coaches the volleyball team alongside her husband.

According to the couple's wedding site, the two got married July 21, 2012, in Michigan.

Mesa graduated from Concordia University Ann Arbor, where she studied secondary education with a concentration in math and biology, and played volleyball.

The Michigan native met Keith Mesa in 2009 when she took a job opening at Colonial Forge, working as a geometry teacher and assistant junior varsity coach.

Although she wrote online that at first she could not stand her future husband because he was 'set in his ways' and 'intense,' not before long the two started dating and got engaged two years later.
