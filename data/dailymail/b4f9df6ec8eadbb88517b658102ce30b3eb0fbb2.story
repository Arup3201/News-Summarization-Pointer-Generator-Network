A 16-day-old baby died Saturday, one day after her family missed a scheduled home visit from the Department of Children and Families (DCF), says authorities.

Bailey Irish of Fitchburg was not breathing when she was brought to HealthAlliance Hospital on Saturday morning by her parents Travis Irish, 26, and Charis Irish, 24.

The infant was pronounced dead shortly before 8am. The cause of death has not yet been established.

Bailey Irish's 24-year-old mother Charis said on Wednesday that she is 'heartbroken' over the death of her 16-day-old daughter last Saturday

The DCF last visited the family on March 26, according to the Telegram.

The agency had planned a home visit for Friday, the day before Bailey Irish died, but the family was not home and it was rescheduled for April 28.

'DCF received a 51A report and is investigating this tragic death, ' spokesperson Cayenne Isaksen wrote in a statement.

'We are cooperating fully with law enforcement in their active investigation. The family has been receiving support and services from DCF since October 2012.'

A 51A is a report of suspected neglect or abuse.

Community support: A fundraising page has been established to help the family with funeral costs for their daughter

The Irish family has another child, an 18-month-old son.

The baby's father Travis Irish issued a plea for help in the form of donation towards her funeral costs on social media yesterday.

A fundraising page has been established for the purpose called Bailey's Wings.

'Bailey was taken too soon from us. This family is going through enough with the loss of their sweet angel,' it reads, adding that the pain the family is in is too 'unbearable to think about.'

As of Monday afternoon, $785 has been raised for the family.

Police are currently investigating the death.
