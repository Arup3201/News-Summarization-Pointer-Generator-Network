These are the adorable images of a turtle teaching her baby how to swim.

Perched on its mother’s back the tiny turtle appears to be practising its breaststroke.

As the two gazed towards the water the mother began acting out the swimming motion for the toddler - a yellow-bellied slider - to mimic.

'I couldn¿t believe what I was seeing': The adorable pictures were captured by photography student Maria Manzano

The heart-warming pictures were captured at Shingle Creek Park in Kissimmee, Florida, by photography student Maria Manzano.

Miss Manzano, 21, said: 'I was visiting a local park and as I walked I found a lake. I was busy shooting away then all of the sudden I saw the turtles.

'I had to look twice as I couldn’t believe what I was seeing. At first I thought they were a sculpture placed there.

'But then I realised they were moving their legs and their necks and it seemed like synchronized swimming.

'What I thought was even more amazing was that they didn’t seem scared by my presence.

'It was fascinating - watching a parent teaching child.'
