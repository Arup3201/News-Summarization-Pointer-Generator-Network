A bizarre phenomenon was spotted over Britain this week which looked like someone had punched a hole in the sky.

However, experts at the Met Office say the hole was in fact a holepunch or fallstreak cloud.

This atmospheric phenomenon is believed to be caused by a combination of both mother nature and man.

Experts say this pattern was probably caused by ice crystals forming round an aeroplane

For
 the fallstreak hole to begin, cirrocumulus or altocumulus must contain 
super-cooled water which cannot freeze without a tiny particle to first 
cling to.

Scientific 
opinion as to what finally causes the ice to form and begin to 
crystallize in the atmosphere has only solidified in recent years as 
meteorologists have become more certain that airplanes flying through 
the clouds start the process.

Air passing along propeller blades 
or wings expands and cools rapidly.

The ice crystals begin to form and 
after the plane is long gone - the crystals can still be seen where 
they've dropped down below the cloud.

What's left above the drifting ice particles is a round hole in the cloud that can sometimes be very  large.

If the sun catches the particles at just the right angle, another 
phenomenon called a sun dog can form as a bright patch of colored light 
hovering in the sky.

Nicole Maxey, from the Met Office, said: 'This is a holepunch or fallstreak cloud.

'It forms when part of the cloud layer forms ice crystals which are large enough to fall.

'This happens in clouds of supercooled water droplets – water that is below 0°C but not yet frozen.

'These water droplets need a tiny particle, a nucleus, to freeze or to be cooled below -40°C.

'Aircraft punching through this cloud layer can cause air to expand and cool as it passes over the aircraft wings or propeller.

'This change in temperature can be enough to encourage the supercooled droplets to freeze and fall from the cloud layer in this distinctive pattern.'
