This is the incredible moment a diver balances a shark on the palm of his hand on the bottom of the ocean floor.

The diver - known only as Tom - dove 45-feet in the Bahamas to meet with a pack of 15 Caribbean Reef sharks.

He then chose a shark and sent it to sleep by performing a gentle nose rub. After hypnotising the shark, he then managed to balance one in the palm of his hand.

Amazing: This is the incredible moment a diver balances a Caribbean reef shark in the palm of his hand on the bottom of the ocean floor

Danger: The diver - known as Tom - dove 45-feet to the ocean floor to find a pack of 15 Caribbean Reef sharks

American business student Graham Gibson, 31, and his wife Debbie took these incredible photographs in the Bahamas to coincide with the Discovery Channel's World Shark Week.

Conservationists - such as the shark hypnotist shown in these pictures - highlight the unusual side to these vulnerable creatures.

Mr Gibson said: 'My wife and I were both surprised at how gently and calmly the sharks behaved.

'Right from the beginning, our shark whisperer Tom was able to start hypnotizing one of the sharks.

'It became completely docile in his hands. Once he had calmed the shark, he gently grasped its dorsal fin and turned the shark in the water so that it was parallel to us.

'Moving slowly to avoid disrupting the shark's trance, Tom brought its body towards us until the shark was sitting directly in our laps. My wife and I lightly touched the shark's body and its fins, the skin feeling somewhat like a rubbery, fine-grain sandpaper.'

The shark diver was able to hypnotise the shark by inducing what scientists call 'tonic immobility' or 'apparent death' as it is otherwise known.

Tonic immobility is a state of temporary paralysis caused by rubbing the nose of the shark.

The effect lasts for around 15 minutes and the shark is not harmed by being gently induced into this state. It's not known exactly why sharks respond to a nose rub in this way - but marine experts believe this could be a defence mechanism.

Mr Gibson explained how people react when they see his pictures of this eye opening phenomena.

'Many people say - "That's amazing, but I would never do it," he said.

'Similarly, others have mentioned that we must have been quite brave to dive with sharks so close, and that it looked quite dangerous.

'Reef sharks are not known to attack humans though.

'Being there and seeing these animals move, I never felt threatened.

'The sharks were not interested in us at all, and seemed almost friendly. But it's good to keep in mind that these are wild animals.'
