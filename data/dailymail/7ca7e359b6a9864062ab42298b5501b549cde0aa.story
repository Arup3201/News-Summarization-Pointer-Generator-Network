The tragic death of one of the world's best loved comedians and actors saw Robin Williams become the top trending search term on Google in 2014.

Williams topped Google's list of 2014's fastest-rising search requests both in the U.S. and around the world.

Robin Williams, who died in August aged 63, was followed by global events such as the World Cup in July, the Ebola outbreak in West Africa and the rise of violent islamist group ISIS in the middle east.

Still number one: Following the death of Robin Williams, his name became the top search trend on Google, both global and in the U.S.

The list of top trending Google search terms is dominated by tragedies, with millions also looking for information on the two Malaysia Airlines tragedies, the armed conflict in Ukraine and the fatal shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri.

On a positive note, the second 'top trending' term in the U.S. and globally was the World Cup, which took place in July, addictive app-game Flappy Bird came in as number five, and Disney's 2013 hit film Frozen still reigns supreme this year on number nine.

 'The passing of beloved comedian and actor Robin Williams shook the world, bringing many people online to search for more information and to remember, and putting Williams in the #1 spot on our global trends charts,' Google's vice president of search, Amit Singhal said in a blog post.

'There was even an uptick in searches related to depression tests and mental health in the days following his death.'

'It was a year in which we were struck by the death of a beloved comedian, and watched news unfold about a horrific plane crash and a terrifying disease,' Singhal said.

'We were captivated by sporting events, and had our fun with birds, a bucket of ice and a frozen princess.'

Williams, Ebola, the World Cup and the Ice Bucket also ranked among the most-discussed subjects this year on Facebook, which released its list last week. Google released its list Tuesday. 

Williams' death drove many people to reminisce about his career highlights.

In the first few days after Robin Williams'  suicide, there was a six-fold increase in the number of Google searches for 'carpe diem' - a Latin phrase for 'seize the day' that Williams popularized in the film 'Dead Poets Society.'

Reports about Williams' long-running battle with depression caused searches for that term to triple. 

There was also a flurry of searches about his movies (the top five were: 'Mrs. Doubtfire,' ''Dead Poets Society,' ''Good Will Hunting,' ''Jumanji' and 'Patch Adams.')

Google's worldwide list of the year's hottest search requests mirrored the activity in the U.S. with a few exceptions. Wurst didn't make the Top 10 list in the U.S., nor did the Winter Olympics. 

Google's review follows annual roundups compiled during the previous two weeks by its main search rivals.

Although Google's list usually comes last each year, its rankings typically provide more telling insights into what people were thinking because the company's technology processes about two out of every three search requests made on the Internet.

Yahoo's search lists indicated that its websites tend to attract entertainment-minded people. 

1. Robin Williams

2. World Cup

3. Ebola

4. Malaysia Airlines

5. ALS Ice Bucket Challenge

6. Flappy Bird

7. Conchita Wurst

8. ISIS

9. Frozen

10. Sochi Olympics

While Ebola topped Yahoo's rankings for 2014, celebrities or entertainers occupied six of the other slots. 

They were singer Ariana Grande (No. 3), actress Jennifer Lawrence (No. 4), actress Kaley Cuoco (No. 5), reality TV star Kim Kardashian (No. 6), singer Miley Cyrus (No. 8) and actress Jennifer Aniston (No. 10). 

Yahoo's list was rounded out by: the video game 'Minecraft,' whose popularity prompted Microsoft to buy it for $2.5 billion earlier this year; 'Frozen' and Apple's latest gadget, the iPhone 6.

Instead of doing a wide-ranging compilation of top searches, Microsoft's Bing separated its lists into disparate categories, such as athletes (NBA star LeBron James soared the highest), celebrities (Kardashian reigned), vacation destinations (Costa Rica) and musicians (Beyonce).
