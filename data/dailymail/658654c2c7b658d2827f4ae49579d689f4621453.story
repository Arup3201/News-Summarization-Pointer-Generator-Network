Vincent Kompany believes Frank Lampard is motivated to end his career in England by helping Manchester City win some silverware this season.

The former England midfielder was released by Chelsea after 13 years at Stamford Bridge at the end of last season and joined City on a short-term deal before joining MLS side New York City next year.

And Kompany says Lampard – who won three Premier League titles, four FA Cups, two League Cups as well as the Champions League and Europa League at Chelsea – is up for the challenge of helping City retain their title.

Asked if he found it strange seeing Lampard in City blue, Kompany told Match of the Day Magazine: ‘No! I’ve seen so many players go from big clubs in England to Man City.

‘He’s settled in so well and been one of the outstanding players in training. Maybe it’s given him the extra motivation to get that last little bit out of his career.

‘There’s not much more he can achieve, but it’s another challenge and you can feel that he’s up for it!’

And Kompany is confident that Manuel Pellegrini’s side can retain the title – despite other sides like Chelsea and Manchester United strengthening over the summer.

He added: ‘We like to think we’ve improved. That should be the main thing for us.

‘Every single day I see very successful and talented players still wanting to improve and as long as we keep that mindset the sky is the limit for us!’

City rivals Manchester United had a disappointing season last year finishing outside the Champions League places for the first time in over 20 years.

But they have tried to address their problems by appointing Louis van Gaal as manager and spending £160millon on players such as Angel di Maria, Ramadel Falcao, Ander Herrera and Luke Shaw.

But Kompany is not worried about what their neighbours are doing.

He added: ‘The main thing for me is what happens on the blue side of Manchester. If we’re doing what we need to I don’t care too much what’s happening at other teams.’
