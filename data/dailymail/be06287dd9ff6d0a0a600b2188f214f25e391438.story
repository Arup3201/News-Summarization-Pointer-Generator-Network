A 500-year-old piece of the battle flag which flew on the field where King Richard III was slain is going up for auction.

The red and gold cloth fragment was, auctioneers believe, a standard of the future Henry VII during the pivotal and bloody fight between the houses of Lancaster and York which took place at Bosworth Field in 1485.

Hansons Auctioneers say the remnant, measuring six-and-a-half inches by five-and-a-half inches, should make between £3,000 and £5,000 when they auction it this weekend.

A piece of history: The battered fragment from the flag has survived more than five centuries

The firm's Charles Hanson said the fragment was part of a far larger flag carried by Sir Robert Harcourt who was standard bearer to Henry Tudor during the fight.

'It's difficult to say exactly what the standard would have looked like but it probably measured at least two foot by four foot and was a large flag that was held aloft for army colleagues to see on a hill - it would have been very much a focal point for a military advancement,' he said.

'It is an incredible find from one of the most important battles ever fought on British soil.'

Henry's forces killed Richard at the Battle of Bosworth Field, ending
the Wars of the Roses and marking the beginning of the Tudor dynasty 
which ruled England until 1603.

The Derbyshire-based auctioneer said the flag fragment had been one of three decaying parts originally hung above the tomb of Sir Robert Harcourt, who was standard bearer to the then Henry Tudor during the battle.

Sir Robert, a Knight Of The Bath, was buried in St Michael's Church in Stanton Harcourt, Oxfordshire, after he died in 1490.  The remnant was then passed to a local family who passed it down through generations before deciding to sell it.

Mr Hanson said the material's provenance was 'very good' as it had been in the keeping of the same family in Northamptonshire since at least 1847, when it had been mounted in a frame for safe-keeping.

He said: 'Our vendors are obviously aware of its social value today since the imagination of what happened at the Battle of Bosworth will keep historians debating for years to come.

'I am just delighted such a fundamental accessory to that 1485 battle has been unearthed only months after finding King Richard III in a Leicester car park.

'As an auctioneer, I thrive on the social relevance such bygone artefacts had on society.  If only this fragment could talk it could tell us so much.'

The auctioneer told MailOnline he hoped the flag would be bought by someone in the UK, preferably a museum or a collector who would put it on permanent loan in a British museum.

International interest in King 
Richard has boomed after human remains uncovered in an old friary 
beneath a Leicester car park in 2012 were earlier this year confirmed by
experts as being those of the late monarch - the last of the Yorkist 
line, who reigned from 1483 until his death in battle.

Mr Hanson said that the current interest in the Yorkist king around the world meant that the fragment may fetch 'considerably more' than its estimate when it is auctioned on Saturday.

The Battle of Bosworth Field was fought on the morning of August 22, 1485 and marked the end of the War Of The Roses, the 30-year civil war between the houses of York and Lancaster.

One of the most important clashes in English history, it saw the death of Richard III, ushered in the Tudor dynasty and gave Shakespeare one of his best known quotations - 'A horse, a horse, my kingdom for a horse'.

The battle marked the final confrontation between the Yorkist king Richard III and his challenger Henry Tudor, Earl of Richmond and leader of the House of Lancaster.

Following an unsuccessful attempt to invade England from his base in France, Henry arrived on the coast of Wales on August 1, 1485.

Gathering support as he marched inland, Richard hurriedly mustered troops and intercepted Henry's army south of Market Bosworth in Leicestershire.

After Richard's death on the battlefield his rival was crowned King Henry VII and became the first English monarch of the Tudor dynasty, which lasted until 1603.

The remains of Richard III, who died in 1485 at the Battle of Bosworth Field, were discovered by archaeologists under a car park in Leicester last September.

Since then where his remains should lie has been the subject of a fierce battle between Leicester Cathedral, the Richard III Society, and a group of the king's distant relatives.

Earlier this month the cathedral announced plans for a £1.3m tomb for the king, but the society branded the design 'too modern and stylised' and said it would withdraw £40,000 of funding.

The society's Philippa Langley, who initiated the search for his remains, said the design was too contemporary and did not reflect the fact 'that there is a warrior king beneath the ground'.

The cathedral has hit back, saying it will not change the design to secure the funding from the historical group and that it would not be 'held hostage'.

Meanwhile the Plantagenet Alliance, a group of distant relatives of the long-dead king, has weighed into the argument, calling for his remains to be buried in York, where Richard had strong links.

The alliance last month won a judicial review of the licence that said his remains should go to Leicester.
