If you're out and about on the streets of Britain this week you might want to keep an eye on where you're going to avoid bumping into the invisible people that may be lining its streets.

No Dynamo has not been up to his old tricks again, but rather a body artist who has been making her subjects 'disappear' into famous landmarks. 

Trina Merry, 34, spends up to eight hours painstakingly painting the bodies of models so that they are almost invisible to the eye by blending them into the backgrounds of familiar UK landmarks.

Lost in London: Body artist Trina Merry paints models' bodies so that they blend seamlessly into famous landmarks 

From traditional British sights like Stonehenge and Westminster Abbey to 21st century vistas such as the London Eye and the capital s modern metallic skyline.

Originally from the USA Trina started her body paintings in New York last year, painting female subjects so that they blended in with the city's landmarks.

Patient painting: It can take Trina up to eight hours painting the bodies of her subjects 

Work in progress: Trina often gets stopped by passersby asking lots of questions about her work

Big Ben and his little friend: Once completed the models must stand perfectly still in order to line up and blend in with their landmark

In NYC Trina had the law on her side as the city allows people to strip off in public for the purpose of artistic expression. However, she had to do some serious negotiating with London police in order to complete her work.

The authorities were not the only obstacle that Trina faced as her work attracted fascinated crowds of bystanders and hundreds of confused tourists who were all keen to ask questions.

For Trina the process creates a new way of viewing people in the cities they live in.  

This job has legs: Trina says the body paintings give a more reflective view of a person in their surroundings 

Overseas art: Trina started her body artistry back home in the USA but has since branched out to the UK, here a man is almost invisible against the Southbank's Globe theatre

Is there wheely someone there? A man is almost unrecognisable against the London Eye

'They're softly in the background, and you've got more of a reflective view of the person within the landscape.' 

The process of creating each work requires great patience. It is a carefully-planned ritual, which involves waiting until there is no chance of rain which could wash off the meticulously detailed designs.  

'It feels great to be painted,' said Jessica Mellow one of Trina's New York models at the time of being painted.

'You feel the transformation process. The brush itself, it's really soft. It feels more like a massage.'
