An ex-husband allegedly shot dead his former wife and her brother, before injuring a family friend and his 70-year-old father-in-law by slamming his truck into a house.

The shooting happened on Sunday around 4pm in a neighborhood near Kendall in Miami, Florida.

Neighbors described repeated blasts ringing out and then a white truck rolling down the street. A man believed to be the suspect chased the vehicle and put it in reverse, leading the SUV to race out of control up the street and into the front of a home.
