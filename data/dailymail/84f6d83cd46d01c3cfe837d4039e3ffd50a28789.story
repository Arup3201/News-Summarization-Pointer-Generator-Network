Russia has responded to a sarcastic tweet by Canadian NATO officials that mocked their excuse that troops had mistakenly wandered into Ukraine with its own map of the area.

The Twitter account Russians at NATO posted the map, which shows the Crimea region that was annexed by Russia in March, as part of Russian territory. 

It comes with an explanation they are helping Canadian colleagues 'catch up with the contemporary geography of Europe'.

Russia has responded to Canada's mocking tweet by posing their own map of the area, showing the annexed Crimea region as part of Russia territory

Canadian officials at NATO had posted this sarcastic tweet with a map showing that Ukraine was 'NOT RUSSIA' and that Russia was 'RUSSIA' in response to claims that Russian soldiers found themselves in Ukraine by mistake

The social media spat began on Wednesday when the official NATO account of Canada tweeted a colour-coded map, marked in block letters to clearly show that Ukraine was 'NOT RUSSIA' and that Russia was indeed 'RUSSIA'.

It was accompanied by the explanation: 'Geography can be tough. Here's a guide for Russian soldiers who keep getting lost and 'accidentally' enter Ukraine.'

The tweet went viral, being retweeted more than 31,000 times, including by U.S. U.N. ambassador Samantha Power.

But now Russia has struck back by tweeting its own map of the country, showing Crimea, which was annexed from Ukraine in March, as part of its own territory.

It was also followed up with the caption: 'Helping our Canadian colleagues to catch up with contemporary geography of #Europe @CanadaNATO'

Their tweet, posted yesterday has so far attracted just over 800 retweets. 

The map also shows shaded areas where Abkhazia and South Ossetia are located, which have declared their independence from Georgia but still contain Russian forces after a conflict in 2008.

They also posted: 'BTW why not share Canadian experience of "asymmetrical federalism" with #Kiev's authorities @CanadaNATO' 

Canada's tweet on Wednesday came after 10 Russian soldiers were captured earlier this week in Ukraine, with Moscow insisting they had mistakenly wandered across the border.

Meanwhile Kiev has accused Russia of sending tanks, artillery and troops into Ukraine.

Rick Roth, a spokesman for Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister John Baird said: 'It's important to look at this exchange through the current context.

'The original tweet was in the context of Russian military personnel being found in sovereign Ukrainian territory, claiming they were lost. Nobody believes that.'

Mr Baird had called the recent events a 'significant provocation' in advance of next week's NATO summit in Wales, where the alliance's leaders are expected to hold a special meeting with new Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko.

However, Ukraine is not a member of NATO, so the alliance is not automatically obliged to come to its defence.

President Barack Obama has also ruled out the possibility that the U.S. will take military action over Ukraine and declined to characterise the assault as an invasion.

Meanwhile Dutch Brigadier General Nico Tak said there has been a significant escalation in both the level and sophistication of Russia's military interference in Ukraine.

'We have also detected large quantities of advanced weapons, including air defence systems, artillery, tanks, and armored personnel carriers being transferred to separatist forces in eastern Ukraine,' said Mr Tak.

NATO estimates that as many as 1,000 Russian troops are fighting inside Ukraine with an additional 20,000 soldiers massing on the border for support or possible reinforcements.
