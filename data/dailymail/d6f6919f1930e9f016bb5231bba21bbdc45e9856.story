Ukraine's leaders fear an imminent Russian invasion of their eastern industrial heartland after the last airbase in Crimea was taken over.

The concern follows the violent storming of the military compound in Belbek, the biggest show of Russian force in the three weeks Kremlin troops have been stationed in the peninsula.

Since the annexation of the region was confirmed on Friday, Russian troops have began to gather at the eastern border and Ukraine's military leaders believe they are ready to attack 'at any moment'.

Ukraine's National Security and Defence Council chief Andriy Parubiy told a rally in Kiev: 'The aim of Putin is not Crimea but all of Ukraine... His troops massed at the border are ready to attack at any moment,'

The interim leaders in Kiev fear that 
Russian President Vladimir Putin is developing a sense he could get away
 with further actions after the EU and US only handed him limited 
sanctions.

Foreign Minister Andriy Deshchytsya added: 'We do not know what Putin has in his mind and what would be his decision.

'That's why this situation is becoming even more explosive than it used to be a week ago.'

NATO's top
 military commander added to the fears, suggesting Russia had built up a 'very sizeable' force and even 
speculated Moscow could have other former Soviet states in its 
sights.

Supreme Allied Commander in Europe, U.S. Air Force General Philip Breedlove said Moldova, could be next if Putin decides to put his expansionist policies in place.

Breedlove was one of several Western 
officials and politicians to warn that Russia may not stop there in a 
crisis that has damaged East-West relations.

'The
 (Russian) force that is at the Ukrainian border now to the east is 
very, very sizeable and very, very ready,' the NATO commander told an 
event held by the German Marshall Fund think-tank.'

Fears of a 
military push outside Crimea also heightened after the self-declared 
leader of Russians living in Ukraine said they should rise up against 
Kiev's rule.

Crimea's Russia-backed prime minister
 Sergei Aksyonov said the region began facing a 'sad fate' the moment 
the deadly protests toppled the pro-Kremlin regime in Kiev.

'But
 we resisted and won! Our motherland - Russia - extended her hand of 
help,' said Aksyonov. 'So today, I appeal to you with a call to fight.'

United States senator John McCain compared Putin's actions to those of Adolf Hitler during the 1930's.

The foreign policy specialist said: 'I think he (Putin) is calculating how 
much he can get away with, just as Adolf Hitler calculated how much he 
could get away with in the 1930s.

U.S. President Barack Obama's deputy national security adviser Tony Blinken said the build-up might just be aimed at intimidating Ukraine's new pro-Western leaders but that Russia could invade the country's mainly Russian-speaking east.

'It's possible that they are preparing to move in,' he told CNN.

A meeting of the G7 group has been arranged for Monday in the Netherlands to allow leaders to discuss a response to Russia's actions. Obama is also set to meet Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov for bilateral talks.

Russia said it was complying with international agreements and had no plans to invade. It has called the soldiers who took over Ukrainian bases in Crimea 'self defence forces'.

Around 440 peacekeepers in Transdniestria, a breakaway state on the eastern Moldovan border with Ukraine, with soldiers guarding Soviet-era arms stocks.

It follows a launch of a new military exercise in the area, involving 8,500 artillery men, near Ukraine's eastern border 10 days ago.

'There is absolutely sufficient (Russian) force postured on the eastern border of Ukraine to run to Transdniestria if the decision was made to do that, and that is very worrisome,' Breedlove said.

The speaker of Transdniestria's parliament has urged Russia to incorporate the region, which lies to the west of Ukraine.

The new leaders in Kiev have said Moscow could seek to link up pro-Russian regions in Moldova, and Georgia to Ukraine's east.

But Moscow's ambassador to the European Union, Vladimir Chizhov, said Russia did not have 'expansionist views'.

'There is no intention of the Russian Federation to do anything like that,' he said.

Germany's Foreign Minister 
Frank-Walter Steinmeier underscored the huge potential repercussions of 
Russia's bid to redraw national borders in Europe.

'I'm
 very worried the unlawful attempt to alter recognised borders in our 
European neighbourhood, 25 years after the end of the Cold War, will 
open Pandora's Box,' he said.
