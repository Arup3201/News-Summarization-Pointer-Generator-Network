She has become a household sensation after her indulgent but simple recipes inspired foodies across the country.

But Nigella Lawson could be risking putting her legions of admirers off their own dinners with some of the less than appetising pictures she has been posting online to her Twitter account.

On her official Twitter page she regularly updates her 258,352 followers, who eagerly gobble up her recipe posts, on what she is eating for dinner herself.

Grim: Lamb Shank stew as tweeted by Nigella (left) and as it appears on her website (right)

It includes a lamb shank stew, which looks decidedly different to that pictured in her book and online.

It also includes some tired looking leftover chicken and pasta, scrambled eggs 'carpet bombed' with truffles and a host of basic home cooking such as eggs and bacon and Shepherd's Pie.

The fried chicken looks crispy to the point of being burned, and rows of tray baked stuffing would look more fitting in a school or industrial kitchen.

Hungry? Scrambled eggs 'carpet bombed' with white truffles and tray bakes of panetonne stuffing 'as far as the eye can see'

The Domestic Goddess admits her pictures are less than flattering, but insists they still taste delicious.

Next
 to a picture of her fried chicken 'experiment' she wrote: 'Another 
fried chicken experiment - a bit darker than it should be, but dee-lish'

Alongside a picture of breakfast eggs and black pudding: 'Hmm breakfast
 looks rather different than I'd anticipated. Sure it'll taste good 
though.'

And a pasta dish whipped up from leftover chicken and sauce she admitted was 'Very un-Italian' but added that she 'can't bear waste.'

Not quite as expected: Her breakfast of eggs and black pudding did not turn out quite as she had hoped and her fried chicken experiment was also 'darker than expected' the celebrity chef admitted online

The 52-year-old domestic goddess has recently revealed that she counts doughnuts and deep fried chocolate among her diet secrets, and credits drinking lot of water for helping her shed the pounds.

Speaking at the Cheltenham Literature Festival, Nigella said: 'Iâ€™m a great believer in fat, I like any doughnut thatâ€™s going.

'I like anything in batter or that is deep fried. My view is that you moisturise from the inside.'

Nigella added that she had fried a Mars bar, and even come up with her own recipe for a deep fried Bounty bar, revealing: 'I have not only had a deep fried Mars Bar, I have also done a recipe for deep fried Bounty. Very delicious. Typically tropical.

My doctor once told me I was drinking too much water, certainly at least 3 litres a day.'

And instead of cutting out bread, a common way to lose weight fast among celebrities, Nigella thinks of carbohydrates as her friends.

Asked what her favourite midnight snack would be, Nigella said: 'Athough it is shameful to say it, it is something I donâ€™t have to cook - a really good baguette and some fantastic blue cheese, probably gorgonzola that can walk on its own!'
