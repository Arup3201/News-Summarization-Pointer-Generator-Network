The terminally ill teenager who has raised more than £3 million for charity has said that 'every second alive feels very special'.

Stephen Sutton, 19, has just updated his Facebook profile to tell his followers that he feels very fortunate to still be here.

And today, his former headteacher, Stuart Jones, has described him as 'an exceptional lad'.

Stephen wrote: 'One week ago I posted a "thumbs up farewell" photo that went viral. As mentioned, at that point a genuinely thought I was a goner, but one week on I'm still here!

'Overall my time here will still be cut significantly short by my illness (...but I've known that anyway for a while anyway).

'Coughing up [a] tumour has helped hugely, but...I am still ravaged by tumours elsewhere that will and are currently harming me.

'But with my breathing fine and no other acute medical problems at the moment, we can optimistically look forward to a period of "future" that at the beginning of the week seemed impossible.

'It still might not be long (fingers crossed it is though) but due to the circumstances, I feel very fortunate to be here, and every second alive feels very special!!

'With more immediate time and health my medical team are currently discussing what to do next to further elongate/comfort the rest of the journey as much as possible - we should have a plan of what's happening next very soon.

'In the meantime: to celebrate still being here after this crazy week, to celebrate this wonderful journey called life, and to celebrate being part of raising over £3,000,000 for Teenage Cancer Trust... Here's a huge thumbs up from me!!!!'

Stephen, 19, has received hundreds of letters of support from across the world

Stephen initially hoped to raise £1 million for the Teenage Cancer Trust but donations have rocketed past the £3 million mark this afternoon

Today Stephen's former headmaster at Chase Terrace Technology College, in Burntwood, described him as 'an exceptional lad'.

Stuart 
Jones told MailOnline that Stephen was an 'exceptional student' who 
achieved straight As in his GCSEs and AS-levels and that he was expected
 to get As in his A-levels but was unable to sit them.

He
 explained that Stephen had an interview at the University of Cambridge 
and that he had planned to read medicine at university.

He said Stephen was also a talented drummer and cross country runner while at school.

He
 said: ‘He is a remarkable young man. He’s all the things you’d want 
someone to be – he’s very emotionally intelligent and supportive of 
others.

'He is very able in many things but has no hint of arrogance or complacency.

'He has a really quick sense of humour and he is incredibly quick thinking. He really is an exceptional lad.’

Last night comedian Jason Manford held a last minute gig to raise money for Stephen's fund. The gig sold out in just four minutes

Stephen (pictured with comedian Jimmy Carr) received the letters of support despite many just being addressed to 'Stephen Sutton, Burntwood, England'

It has emerged that Stephen has received messages of support from all over the world.

He
 has had letters from as far away as India which have arrived despite 
being addressed simply to ‘Stephen Sutton, Burntwood, England’.

The
 teenager, who is in hospital with terminal colorectal cancer, has 
inspired the world with his bid to raise money for the Teenager Cancer 
Trust.

A family friend said last night: ‘It is utterly unbelievable and shows how big this has become.

‘The letters have no address, no postcode, but they still find their way to Stephen. What's happening is hard to put into words.

‘This week has been a real roller coaster for Stephen's family and these messages have helped them tremendously.’

A
 Royal Mail spokesman added: ‘Our postmen and women go the extra mile to
 make sure the letters and parcels we handle get to the right person.

‘We're
 proud to have been able to play a very small part in Stephen's 
remarkable achievement by ensuring his family receive these important 
letters.’

Stephen was admitted to hospital last Sunday after tumours caused his lung to collapse and he feared he only had days to live.

Stephen has terminal colorectal cancer and last week it was believed he had just days left to live. He has now improved slightly and is able to breathe without help

He posted a message on Facebook asking people to help him reach his target of raising £1 million for the Teenage Cancer Trust – at the time he had raised about £500,000.

His story rapidly went viral on the internet and donations started pouring in – he has now raised more than £3 million and is still fighting for his life.

In the family's only interview, Stephen's elder brother Chris said: ‘I've struggled to get my head round the way people have reacted.

‘When I eventually do, my head will probably explode.’

Since his admission to hospital, Stephen’s condition has unexpectedly improved.

Yesterday he informed his 454,000 Facebook followers that he was feeling ‘fantastic’ after ‘coughing up a tumour’.

Stephen was diagnosed with cancer in 2010 when he was just 15. He had surgery to remove the tumour but it returned a year later and he was told that it was incurable

Stephen wrote: ‘This whole week has been pretty unbelievable and I can barely fully get my head round everything that has gone on.

‘After some visitors left I tried sitting up in a chair, but straight away asked the nurse to increase my oxygen levels as I was getting extremely short of breath.

‘I returned to my bed where I stabilised slightly for a while, but my breathing was still not right.

‘After lying there for a bit longer the coughing increased and suddenly the shortness of breath became incredibly severe.

‘I felt like I was like suffocating.

‘Then I forced out an oval red stained solid object through my mouth.

Russell Brand has joined the Thumbs Up For Stephen campaign by posting a message of support on Twitter

‘My breathing and airway straight away felt clearer, but I spent the next hour violently coughing and choking, but then eventually my breathing once again stabilised.

‘Since then, my breathing has dramatically improved. I'm really stuck for words to describe it.

‘This morning I am relying on NO external oxygen to breathe at all and I'm feeling bl**dy fantastic!

‘The doctors have discussed what's happened and the only plausible conclusion is that I've literally coughed up a tumour that was blocking my airway.’

Stephen added that an X-ray had revealed an improvement in his collapsed right lung.

He said: ‘Physiologically a tumour breaking away like this is possible, but it all just seems incredibly surreal - mind, I'm not complaining!

Olympic cyclist Sir Chris Hoy has also pledged his support for Stephen on Twitter

‘My lungs are still pretty messy with other tumours, clots and potential infections and inflammations affecting my overall condition but, for now at least, I am in a good stable state.

‘I have no immediate problems and, in fact, feel better than I did when I first came into hospital last Sunday!

‘It's still a case of taking each day as it comes, but at the moment the days just keep on coming!’

His 21-year-old brother, Chris, added: ‘Stephen is improving all the time. His body seems to have become used to functioning on one lung.

‘On Monday he looked dreadful and there were worries he may not last the night, but he's made a miraculous fight back.’

Comedian Jason Manford last night staged a fundraising gig at his Birmingham comedy club in aid of the teenager's cause.

Olympic swimmer Rebecca Adlington has also expressed support for Stephen on Twitter

The event sold out in four minutes, prompting Mr Manford to joke: ‘I wish all my gigs were like that. I might have to get him [Stephen] to do my PR.’

Mr Manford visited Stephen at Birmingham's Queen Elizabeth Hospital on Thursday.

The star told LBC radio: ‘He is amazing. Even in bed with tubes and masks, with nurses coming in every 20 minutes to give him medicine, he was still talking about doing a sky dive and hoping to get in the Guinness Book of Records and different things on his bucket list.

‘He was talking about putting the fun into fundraising.’

Celebrities including Stephen Fry, Russell Brand, Clare Balding, Rebecca Adlington, Sir Chris Hoy and Piers Morgan have backed Stephen's fundraising efforts, and music mogul Simon Cowell pledged to make a ‘significant donation’.
