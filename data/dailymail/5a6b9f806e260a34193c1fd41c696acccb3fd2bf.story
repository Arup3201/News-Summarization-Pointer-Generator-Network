Bob Hoskins doesn’t spring to mind as one of life’s philosophers. The late actor didn’t have the looks or voice for it. But what he did have was common sense.

His fittingly individual approach was distilled in the ‘Eleven Lessons In Life’ he wrote for his daughter Rosa and which she revealed this week after his death from pneumonia on Tuesday.

As a list, it may not quite rank alongside the Ten Commandments or the Seven Beatitudes as a guide on how to live our lives. But as a rough guide on  muddling through with good intentions, it’s hard to beat.

I have a daughter, too. Her name is Louise, and if she were to one day make a record of the life lessons that she (and her brothers) inherited from me, the list wouldn’t be that far from Bob’s.

Obviously, laughter would be top of my list, too. Whether it’s quietly joking at the eccentricities and unreasonable demands of those who believe they know better or owning up to our own little vanities and absurdities, humour gets us all through the day.

Let’s face it, the human condition is often little more than small-scale tragi-comedy, to which we all know the inevitable end.

‘Laugh long and loud and make other people laugh,’ Bob recommended, offering a recipe long known for relieving pain, burning up calories, lowering the risk of heart disease and sending feel-good oxytocin hormones charging through the bloodstream.

Whatever we do, we mustn’t take ourselves too seriously.

We should approach our work with all seriousness, certainly, but no one likes a boring, pompous, self-loving, mirror-watching prig — unless as a figure of fun to be secretly laughed at.

Being an actor and therefore an extrovert, Bob’s advice was to be flamboyant, eccentric, unique.

‘Don’t try to adapt yourself to someone else’s view of normal’; ‘Don’t worry about other people’s opinions.’

He must have had the armour of an armadillo. Most of us aren’t as  thick-skinned. He assumed that if someone doesn’t like you they must be ‘stupid’, ‘blind’ or have ‘bad taste’.

That may have worked for him. But in the more tortured, lonely writing profession, it strikes me that if one is evidently disliked, then a few ruminations as to why that might be the case could be called for.

I must be honest. ‘Have I behaved like a complete prat?’ has, on occasion, been a question that has troubled me into the small hours. And, sadly, sometimes I recognise that I have. Must try harder next time, I think, and go to sleep.

And talking of rest, I’d like to add to Bob’s list that if we’ve fallen out with someone we love — partner, child, parent or best friend — we should always try to make up before the lights go out.

Never dwell on silent, bubbling bitterness. It’ll taste worse the  next day.

And never, ever, as I have sometimes done, rattle off an email or letter in a rage late at night, no matter how justified it might seem at the time.

Sleep on it. Things may not always look better in the morning, but they nearly always look different. As the years have gone by, it has become clear to me — and, apparently, did to Bob, too — that whatever we do we should do it to the best of our ability.

We shouldn’t be afraid of disappointment and use fear of failure as an excuse for not trying.

To miss out on any opportunity through timidity or because we feel  it’s time to stop chasing  rainbows is like getting off the ride before it’s finished and then watching from the side.

So whatever happens, never give in. Of course, success can’t be assured and, like most people, I’ve proved that now and again. But, once we stop trying, one thing is absolutely certain. We’re going to fail.

There’s something else, too. We all like winning prizes, be it a school cup or something that takes us all  the way to Buckingham Palace and a smile from the Queen. But the real fun is rarely in the achievement and the recognition. It’s in the doing.

And I’m all for Bob’s advice to appreciate beauty. I wish I’d learned this sooner.

I sometimes think that when I was young I had a sight defect. Because when I went to Paris and Florence as a young man, though I could see perfectly well, I was hardly aware of the beauty that surrounded me unless it was  wearing a dress or a blouse.

Now the entire world dazzles me. Like Bob, I take photographs all the time, snapping the changing seasons in the garden, recently so heavy with wisteria, the growing grandchildren and London’s  elegant Georgian squares where once I lived, seemingly with my eyes closed.

Whatever we do in life we should try to catch, enjoy and preserve the moment. I spent years interviewing famous people on a tape recorder. I still have many of the recordings. But not a single one of my late mother. It never occurred to me until it was too late.

Family is, of course, everything. As Bob told his daughter Rosa: ‘Home isn’t houses. And it isn’t country. It’s family.’

He was right. Home is where you make it, where the family gathers, where the children know they can always come back to — though it might be in a quite different building from the one in which they grew up. Home is family.

I used to joke that one way to a happy life was to marry your best friend, which is what I did when I married Plum.

What I hadn’t realised was that one day our children would become our — joint — closest friends.

They have. And nothing could make me happier.
