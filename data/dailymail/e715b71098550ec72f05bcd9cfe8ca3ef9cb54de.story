Health conscious coffee lovers who order skinny milk may not be getting what they ask for as a survey reveals more than half of cafes serve up low fat instead to customers.

Australia's capital has long been reported to have more cafes and restaurants per capita than anywhere else in the country but it seems that Canberra's caffeine crowd is not always getting exactly what they order.

Although it may sound like semantics, low fat milk in fact contains almost two grams more fat than skim milk in a small cappuccino, while there is more than two grams of fat in a small latte which is made with low fat milk compared to the skinny variety.

Only 43 per cent of cafes in Canberra use skim milk while 57 per cent admit to using low fat milk instead

A survey of 30 cafes in Canberra conducted by the LiveLighter campaign has revealed that 'skinny' is not a standard industry term. 

Only 43 per cent of cafes in Canberra use skim milk in a 'skinny' beverage while 57 per cent admit to using low fat milk instead. 

And as many as 37 per cent of coffee shops surveyed don't make skim milk available to their customers.

Some small changes you can make to your coffee order to help maintain a healthy weight:

Dietitian Nerida Volker, said the way coffee is consumed was a factor when thinking about watching your weight. 

'While coffee itself is not is not high in kilojoules or fat, the way we drink it often is and people don't always consider their beverages in their daily nutrition intake,' she said.

'If you drink a large latte made from full cream milk it could contain 1,100 kilojoules and 13 grams of fat. 

'If you consume two or three a day it could contribute to an expanding waistline.'

A large latte with low fat milk has four more grams of fat than one with skim milk while a large skinny cappuccino has 3.5 grams less than a low fat version.

ACT Heart Foundation CEO Tony Stubbs said it's all about making small changes to your lifestyle maintaining a healthy weight.

'When you eat or drink more kilojoules than you need to, fat doesn't just build up around your waist. Toxic fat can build up around your vital organs, increasing your risk of heart disease,' he said.

But don't give up your beloved coffee just yet - it's all about being smart in the way you order. 

'So choose a good quality coffee, make it small and ask for low fat or skim milk. And importantly take the time to sit down and enjoy it,' Ms Volker said.
