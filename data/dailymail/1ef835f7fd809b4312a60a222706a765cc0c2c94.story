Death: Martin Hadfield (pictured with his mother Annie O'Gorman) failed to get responses on almost every job application over a three-month period

A young gardener who was ‘too proud’ 
to claim benefits killed himself after unsuccessfully applying for 40 
jobs in three months, his devastated family said yesterday.

Martin
 Hadfield was left ‘demoralised’ and ‘with no self-worth’ after hours 
filling in forms at his local Job Centre turned out to be in vain.

His
 family said the ‘industrious and hardworking’ 20-year-old lost hope 
after he was repeatedly passed over in favour of younger applicants 
prepared to work for less.

Although
 youth unemployment is now falling, Mr Hadfield’s family said they 
wanted him to be remembered as more than a statistic – and appealed for 
other young jobseekers in his situation to be treated with a ‘human 
touch’ rather than facing red tape and bureaucracy.

‘Martin
 was the kind of guy who was industrious but too proud to tell us if 
anything was wrong,’ his stepfather Peter O’Gorman, 47, said after an 
inquest into Mr Hadfield’s death.

Describing
 how his stepson ‘hated’ going into the Job Centre, he added: ‘Many 
people go in with a sense of self-worth – they really do want a job – 
but come out feeling demoralised and put down.’

Mr
 Hadfield had worked for his stepfather’s car valeting business after 
his GCSEs before getting a job as a landscape gardener and achieving NVQ
 qualifications.

But in 
April last year he lost his job when the firm downsized. He 
unsuccessfully applied for 40 posts over the next three months – and 
most of these applications went ignored because he was ‘undercut’ on 
wages by younger and less experienced candidates.

Just
 24 hours after his last Job Centre appointment in July – which simply 
resulted in an invitation to a ‘follow-up’ meeting – he was found hanged
 at his flat in Tottington, Greater Manchester.

‘On
 the day he died, his mum gave him some money for the bus home and 
instead he walked the five miles home and saved it for something 
important,’ his stepfather said.

‘That
 was the kind of boy he was, hardworking and with so much potential. 
Martin never claimed any money or benefits in his life. He got nothing 
off the government and was proud not to.’

His
 mother Annie O’Gorman, 50, a former prison officer, said: ‘Martin was 
just a regular boy and he just didn’t think to talk to someone about 
what he was going through. It was just a tragic moment of madness.’

Mr O’Gorman said his stepson’s experience of constantly attending the Job Centre had been ‘demoralising’.

There were 5,981 suicides in the UK in 2012 - 77 per cent of which were men, according to statistics published by the Samaritans charity.

This total figure was down slightly from 6,045 in 2011, but up significantly from 5,608 in 2010.

The UK rate of suicide among men aged 20 to 24 in 2012 was 15.5 per 100,000 people, compared to 3.2 for women of the same age.

The only age groups with lower male suicide rates in 2012 were the under 20s and over 60s, the figures also showed.

‘The human touch is so much better than looking at a name on a piece of paper,’ he said. ‘The bureaucracy is ridiculous.

‘In
 the last months of his life [Martin] became a statistic to other 
people. He was a statistic by being out of work, a statistic when he 
went into the Job Centre and now he is a statistic by killing himself.

‘Sadly this statistic seems to be growing, especially in boys Martin’s age who are struggling.’

Mr
 Hadfield’s flatmate Stuart Evans, 20, who found his body, told the 
hearing in Heywood that his friend had been ‘getting more and more fed 
up’ with his fruitless job hunt.

Recording
 a verdict of suicide, coroner Simon Nelson said: ‘Martin was clearly 
very highly thought of and these are fine attributes indeed. It may well
 be a moment of madness – but I feel sure he intended the consequences 
of his actions.’

He urged others in Mr Hadfield’s position to talk through their problems.

Last week figures revealed the number of unemployed 16- to 24-year-olds has fallen to 868,000, its lowest level in five years.
