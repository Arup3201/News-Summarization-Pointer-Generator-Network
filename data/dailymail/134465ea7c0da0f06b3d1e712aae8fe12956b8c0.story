The girlfriend of one of Britain's biggest drug barons helped him run his international cocaine empire from her home in a picturesque town in the Cotswolds, a court heard. 

Anni Rowland worked as a personal assistant for convicted drug smuggler Kevin Hanley and arranged his travel, meetings and money transfers from her home, it is claimed.

Hanley, 52, was jailed for 17 years in October after he brought cocaine into the country by hiding the drugs in shipments of watermelons, pomegranates and broccoli.

Hanley's organisation broken up in 2012 after a National Crime Agency surveillance operation led to the arrest of his gang and the seizure of £2.5m of cocaine (pictured above) and £2m in cash at London property

Hanley's organisation broken up in 2012 after a National Crime Agency surveillance operation led to the arrest of his gang and the seizure of £2.5million of cocaine and £2million in cash. 

Police who raided the Chelsea home of Hanley's co-conspirator John Fowler also found £100,000 of amphetamines and £61,000 of skunk cannabis.

Rowland was involved in the conspiracy with Greek television presenter Chrysi Minadaki, 45, who has also been jailed for her role in the conspiracy, the Old Bailey heard today.

The 52-year-old, who is the mother of Hanley's child, commuted between her home in Stow-on-the-Wold, Gloucestershire, and London for her role in the conspiracy, the jury was told.

She is on trial with Samson Karahassan, 59, who is said to be the manager of the Southall based fruit company Paris Weston, which was the front for the drug operation.

Prosecutor Richard Jory said the drugs ring involved dozens of people across the world and was ‘well planned and well organised'.

‘The drugs and cash may represent only a fraction of the overall drugs imported and the cash generated,’ he added.

The cocaine began its journey in Venezuela before travelling to Greece where it was packed into loads of fruit and vegetables bound for the UK. 

Mr Jory said Rowland ‘was a personal assistant to Hanley who was the main organiser of this conspiracy'. She booked flights and accommodation for Hanley and Fowler around Europe.

‘She made charges for payment where money became due. She arranged for the transfer of money to Hanley and she occasionally attended meetings with him.’

The prosecutor added that Karahassan acted 'in a supervisory capacity'. 

'His task was to sell the large amount of fruit and vegetables after it had been used as a cover load for the drugs,’ Mr Jory said.

Rowland denies conspiracy to supply cocaine amphetamines, cannabis and money laundering.

Karahassan, from London, denies conspiracy to supply the drugs.

Fowler, 58, was earlier jailed for 17 years and Minadaki was sentenced to 16 years in prison.

The trial continues.
