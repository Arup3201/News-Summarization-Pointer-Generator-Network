Urban foxes can usually be found roaming the streets, scampering around in a desperate search for the odd scrap of food.

It's not often they venture further than rubbish bins or hedgerows and their fear of humans usually keeps them tucked away until nightfall.

However, one couple were in for an unexpected shock when they discovered one had sneaked into their home before cosying up in an upstairs bedroom.

Sarah Preddy, 49, and partner Colin 
Linton, 55, were relaxing at their home in Romford, Essex, on Sunday 
when their nine-month-old chocolate Labrador, Molly, alerted them to the
 unusual intruder.

The pair,
 along with Ms Preddy’s stepsons, James, 26, and John, 24, were shocked 
to discover the adult fox had somehow entered their home and made its 
way upstairs in the dead of the night.

Ms Preddy, a freelance consultant, said her partner donned gloves and rake before trying to coax the animal out of the bedroom.

She said: ‘The dog jumped up off the bed and went to the bedroom door looking really distressed and making weird noise, which we thought was a bit odd.

‘My partner opened the door and Molly flew across the landing towards the spare room. We couldn’t believe it when we opened the door and saw the fox was calmly sitting in the corner on the bed.

‘Colin was a bit of an action hero covering himself in a mac and gloves holding a rake to try to coax it out of the bedroom. It was quite a shock.’

The couple managed to capture the moment the fox was ushered down the stairs on video, with footage showing it staring at the family before quickly running off.

Ms Preddy: ‘We didn’t know how to get rid of it and I actually think it was sick, which was the scary thing.

‘It wasn’t acting in a normal way and was covered in mange, which can get passed on so it wasn’t nice.

‘I phoned the RSPCA and it took forever to get through to someone but when I finally did we were told to block off the rest of the house and wait for it to saunter downstairs.

‘It took about an hour to leave but it could’ve taken all day which is a horrible thought.’

She said her adult stepsons were both in their bedrooms with the doors closed when the fox was discovered but said she ‘dread to think what could have happened’ if her seven-month-old grandson had been staying at the house.

However, son James, 26, managed to make light of the situation and quipped:  ‘When I said I was hoping to wake up with a fox in my bedroom this weekend, I didn’t mean literally.’

The family have been plagued by foxes in the past and now feel like ‘prisoners in their own home’ because they can’t leave their doors open anymore.

Ms Preddy said: ‘Urban foxes are always so disgusting and manky and we’ve had problems with them before fouling everywhere.

The couple spent over an hour trying to coax the fox out of their home but eventually it decided to run off

‘I grew up in the country and they are a different breed of animal there.

‘I think we’re going to a real epidemic because the problem is just getting worse, which is very scary.

‘Now we can’t leave the patio doors open and feel like prisoners in our own home.

‘I am completely freaked out and haven’t been in the spare room since because the thought of going where the manky, mangy creature has been all over the duvet makes me feel sick.’

An RSPCA spokesman said: ‘It is unusual for foxes to enter homes as by nature they will tend to avoid human contact.

‘In the rare instances when they do venture into a home, it is likely they are attracted to food which has been left out.’
