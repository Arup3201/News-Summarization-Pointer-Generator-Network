Six-month-old twin girls who were born joined at the abdomen will undergo tissue expansion this month as doctors begin the lengthy process of separating them.

Knatalye Hope and Adeline Faith Mata weighed just 3lbs 7oz each when they were delivered by Cesarean section at Texas Children's Hospital in Houston at 31 weeks on April 11. 

The adorable sisters, who remain in the hospital's Level IV Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, share a liver, diaphragm, pelvis, intestines and heart lining.

Now, they are preparing to undergo six-to-eight weeks of tissue expansion to stretch skin that will be used to cover patches of their bodies when they are separated in December.

Today, Knatalye and Adeline's mother, Elysse, who spends at least seven hours at the hospital every day, said she felt 'sick' with worry about the long and arduous procedure.

'When I think about December I get that sick feeling in my stomach. I want to know how much pain they are going to feel after. What is it going to be like for them?' she told Reuters.  

'They are where they should be developmentally. They reach up for toys, they reach out for us when we get close and talk to them.'

During the surgery in December, two shifts of teams of pediatric, urological, plastic, orthopedic, cardiac and gynecological surgeons will work to separate the girls.

Dr Darrel Cass, pediatric surgeon and co-director of the hospital's Fetal Center, said the separation team will start and the reconstruction team will complete the process.

He added: 'The [girls'] intestines appear to be intermingled but there appears to be enough intestines for both children.'

After the separation, the girls will undergo rehabilitation to learn how to balance, crawl and walk. 

In 1992, surgeons at Texas Children's Hospital successfully separated one-year-old twins Tiesha and Iesha Turner, who  shared a sternum, liver, entwined intestines and fused organs.

Conjoined twins occur once every 200,000 births. Around 40 to 60 per cent  arrive stillborn, while 35 per cent live only one day, according to the University of Maryland Medical Center.

Mortality rates for twins who do live and then undergo separation vary, depending on their type of connection and the organs they share, it said.

The Mata family's life was turned upside down in January when a routine ultrasound revealed that Mrs Mata was carrying conjoined twins. The family was referred to the hospital's Fetal Center. 

The expectant mother, her husband John and their five-year-old son Azariah relocated from Lubbock to Houston, where the girls were born.

On a YouCaring page, Mrs Mata said the twin's 20 per cent chance of survival at birth inspired their middle names, Faith and Hope. 

While the mother spends most of her daily life at the hospital, leaving only when it is time to pick up her son from school, full-time worker Mr Mata spends every weekend with his daughters.

Mr Cass said he expects both Knatalye and Adelie to be able to experience independent, happy lives following the surgery.

But he added: 'It is likely further reconstructive surgeries may be needed in the future. Perhaps the biggest challenges may be orthopedic and in helping them walk and have normal gait.'
