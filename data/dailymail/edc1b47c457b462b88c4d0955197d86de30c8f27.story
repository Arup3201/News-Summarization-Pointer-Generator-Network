QPR are taking a look at Argentine defender Pablo Alvarez ahead of a possible move.

The 30-year-old free agent is training with Rangers in the hope of securing a contract over the coming days.

Alvarez was released by Catania in the summer and has been talking to a number of clubs around Europe.

Queens Park Rangers boss Harry Redknapp is keen on bolstering his defensive options 

Boca Juniors: 2003-05

Estudiantes: 2005-07

Catania: 2008-14

Rosario Central (loan): 2009

Zaragoza (loan): 2012

Formerly of Boca Juniors and Estudiantes, Alvarez can play in both full back positions and as a defensive midfielder.

QPR manager Harry Redknapp will be hoping to bolster his defensive options over the next couple of months as his side have leaked the most amount of goals in the Premier League. 

Alvarez's ability to play in a number of different roles will prove to be an added bonus to Redknapp.
