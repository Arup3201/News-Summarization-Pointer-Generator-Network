New research has discovered that volcanoes can sometimes 'scream' at ever-higher pitches just before they erupt.

Scientists at the University
of Washington analysed an eruption sequence at Alaska's Redoubt Volcano and found what they describe as audible 'screams' that followed seismic activity as the changed from steady pulses to rapid 
tremors.

The researchers also believe that this research and the rise in the frequency of earthquakes and the tremors they cause in the ground could be used to predict future volcanic eruptions.

Some volcanoes 'scream' at ever-higher pitches before they erupt, scientists claim. American researchers believe a rise in the frequency of earthquakes could predict volcanic eruptions. They analysed an eruption sequence at Alaska's Redoubt Volcano in March 2009 (pictured)

The study said that it is not unusual for swarms of small earthquakes to precede a volcanic eruption.

They can reach a point of such rapid succession that they create a signal called a 'harmonic tremor' that is inaudible to humans as it is such a low frequency.

The researchers analysed an eruption sequence at Alaska’s Redoubt Volcano in March 2009.

They found that the harmonic tremor rose to 
substantially higher frequencies and then stopped abruptly just before 
six of the eruptions.

Alicia Hotovec-Ellis, a doctoral student at  University of Washington, said: 'The frequency of this tremor is unusually high for a volcano, and it’s not easily explained by many of the accepted theories.'

The activity hints at a volcano's pressure before an explosion, she said.

The findings of the study, published in the Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research, could help scientists to better understand what happens during eruptive cycles in volcanoes.

However, the source of earthquakes and harmonic tremor is not known.

Earthquakes can reach a point of such rapid succession that they create a signal called a harmonic tremor, which reaches steadily higher frequencies and then stops abruptly before volcano eruptions. The spectacular explosion of the Kilauea Volcano Hawaii is pictured

Some volcanoes emit sound when magma resonates as it pushes up through thin cracks in the Earth’s crust.

But the scientists think that in this case the earthquakes and harmonic tremors happen as magma is forced through a narrow channel under great pressure into the heart of the mountain.

They believe that the thick magma sticks to the rock 
surface inside the channel until the pressure is enough to move it 
higher, where it sticks until the pressure moves it again.

Each of these sudden movements leads to a small earthquake up to 1.5 on the Richter scale.

As the pressure builds and the quakes get smaller but more frequent, they blend into a continuous harmonic tremor.

Ms Hotovec-Ellis said: 'Because there’s less time between each earthquake, there’s not enough time to build up enough pressure for a bigger one.

'After the frequency glides up to a ridiculously high frequency, it pauses and then it explodes.'

She believes that the pause in noise is when the earthquakes cannot keep up any more and the two sides of the fault slide smoothly against each other.

The scientists documented the rising tremor 
frequency, starting at about one hertz, which reached around 30 hertz.

Scientists think the harmonic tremor they studied was caused by pressure building up in channels at the heart of the mountain. This caused earthquakes that blended into a continuous harmonic tremor which eventually lead to an explosion. A lava flow in the National Park in Kalapana, Hawaii is pictured

While humans cannot hear most of the noise, she said that a person lying on the ground directly above the 
magma channel might be able to hear the harmonic tremor when it reaches 
its highest point.

This, however, is probably not advisable, since the highest-pitched tremor is followed by an explosion.

Scientists
at the USGS Alaska Volcano Observatory have dubbed the 
highest-frequency harmonic tremor at Redoubt Volcano 'the screams' 
because they reach such high pitch compared with a  one to five hertz starting
point.

Ms Hotovec-Ellis created a 10 second recording of 10 minutes of seismic activity sound and harmonic tremor, which she sped up 60 times. A one minute recording that condenses an hour of activity includes a staggering 1,600 small earthquakes.

The next step in the scientist's research is to understand why the stresses become so high.
