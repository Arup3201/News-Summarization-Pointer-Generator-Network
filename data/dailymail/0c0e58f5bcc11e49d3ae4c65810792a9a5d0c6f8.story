The head master of one of the most exclusive schools in the U.S. has been arrested on child pornography charges.

Christopher Wheeler faces 25 counts of child porn after a search of his Tower Hill school campus home and office in Delaware, and his private plane.

The 53-year-old, who is also accused of abusing underage boys, turned himself in on Friday after police asked for the public's help in finding him.

Arrested: Tower Hill head teacher Christopher Wheeler is facing charges of child pornography

The unmarried head teacher, who adopted a boy from a Russia in the 2000s, had not been heard of since moving out of the school after the October 22 investigation, according to Delaware Online.

The headmaster, who presided over 
Tower Hill's 750 pupils aged 3 to 18, was missing for two days before 
turning himself in on Friday.

A search of his house, office and private plane last month allegedly uncovered 25 explicit digital images of men engaged in sexual acts with young boys.

The affidavit for the search alleged 
that Mr Wheeler had also abused three boys, though Tower Hill school, 
where parents pay up to $26,400 a year in tuition, was quick to distance
 students from the investigation. 

Mr Wheeler has been charged with child pornography but no other charges relating to the allegations of abuse have been made.

'He is in custody. The Child Predator 
Task Force made arrangements for him to turn himself in,' Jason Miller, 
spokesman for the attorney generals office, said.

'During the search, multiple computers and other digital media, along with other evidence, were seized,' Mr Miller told USA Today.

'A
 forensic examination of the computers and digital media conducted by 
the Delaware Child Predator Task Force recovered multiple images of 
child pornography.'

Officials
 at the day school, one of the top 50 in the U.S., have not commented 
about the arrest, but spokeswoman Nancy Schuckert said the school was 
cooperating with authorities.

In a statement sent to parents on Monday, trustee chairman Earl J. Ball III said: 'We are not aware of complaints about Dr Wheeler’s conduct while he was at Tower Hill.'

Exclusive: Tower Hill School in Delaware, where tuition costs up to $26,400 a year, hired Wheeler in 2004

The head, whose adopted son Nikolai is a professional golfer, was taken on by the exclusive school in 2004. He had previously been assistant head of school and dean of admissions at Lake Forest Academy in Illinois.

Tower Hill, whose alumni include TV personality Dr Oz and Senator Chris Coons, added that Mr Wheeler was 'thoroughly vetted' before being offered the $360,876 a year position.

He is accused of abusing a minor for up to a year while living in Illinois, according to the investigation.

The private pilot and composer also allegedly abused two adolescent boys in their Pennsylvania home about 30 years ago, when he was staying with their family.

In July, Mr Wheeler allegedly admitted to the sexual abuse and apologized after receiving a letter from one of the alleged victims.

'These recent events have been 
devastating, and I do not know that there is a good way to respond to 
such a disturbing scenario,'Mr Ball wrote in his statement to parents at Tower Hill, as details of the case emerged.

Family: Christopher Wheeler's son and professional golfer Nikolai, who he adopted from Russia

The school, which halted its own investigation at the request of prosecutors, said it will resume its inquiry at a later date.

Mr Wheeler's attorney, Thomas Foley, denied that the head teacher had fled from authorities despite a statement released on Thursday saying police were looking for him.

After moving out of the head master's house Mr Wheeler stayed with family out of state, according to Mr Wheeler, who added: 'He was under no order by anyone to stay close by.'

Mr Foley made arrangements for Mr Wheeler to hand himself on Friday, after hearing that he was wanted by authorities.

The head teacher and composer, who used to work as dorm adviser in New York's St Paul's School in Garden City, is being held on $1.5 million bail as he waits for a preliminary hearing on Friday.
