Jermain Defoe's first-half goal against Swansea on Saturday meant that the 33-year-old became the first player to have netted against all 20 of the current Premier League sides.

Defoe joined Sunderland from MLS side Toronto FC during the January transfer window, signing a three-and-a-half-year deal, and there were concerns that the 33-year-old might be past his best. 

But in five games for Sunderland, the striker has notched two goals and his predator instincts in and around the box certainly do not appear to be on the wane.

Defoe's goal helped Sunderland to a 1-1 draw at the Liberty Stadium as The Black Cats continue their battle against relegation. 

Saturday's result left Gus Poyet's men 14th in the table with 24 points, just four above the drop zone.

Whether Sunderland manage to stay in the Premier League this season could very well depend on Defoe's goalscoring form.
