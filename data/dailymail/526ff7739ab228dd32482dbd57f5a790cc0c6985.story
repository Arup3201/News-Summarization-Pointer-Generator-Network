Sir Bruce Forsyth and Sir Paul McCartney have today spoken out about how they believed Jimmy Savile was creepy and disliked him during the 40 years they knew him.

Both stars spent time with the paedophile at various points of their professional lives but were convinced he was a 'suspect' character.

Strictly Come Dancing host Sir Bruce said today: 'I never liked him' and expressed his sadness that Savile used charity work to build a saint-like reputation when in reality he was a child-abuser with hundreds of victims.

Meanwhile Sir Paul has revealed that The Beatles had spent long periods with Savile as he had compered some of their UK shows in the 1960s but they thought his behaviour was strange.

Bizarre: Jimmy Savile acted as the Beatles' MC at the height of their fame but the group thought he was a very strange man. George in particular looks less than impressed in this photo from the 1960s.

In unison: Sir Bruce Forsyth and Sir Paul McCartney have both spoken out today and said that they were unsure of Jimmy Savile and believed he was a strange and unlikeable

At the height of Beatlemania they toured the country in their van and sometimes gave Savile a lift home because they found him 'entertaining', but the DJ would refuse to let them inside for a drink or toilet break.

'When he’d gone we thought why doesn’t he let us in, what is it, because most people would have let us in that we gave a lift to,' he told the Independent, adding: 'We always thought there was something a little bit suspect.'

He also spoke about the sexual climate of the 1960s and 1970s, but said he, John, George, Paul and Ringo were very clear that there was never any underage sex.

'We knew with under 16s it was illegal, so we didn’t do it', adding, 'There was a definite no-no involved in underage kids and that the Beatles had so many adult groupies it was never an issue.'

Meanwhile in a separate interview today Sir Bruce Forsyth declared from the moment he met the Top Of The Pops host: 'I never liked him. I can honestly say that.'

Admission: Sir Paul said when the Beatles toured Britain with Sir Jimmy Savile at times but he would not let them in his house

The pair were two of the BBC's biggest stars but never saw eye-to-eye.

'There was something very difficult to like. It wasn't because he was so brash about everything,' he told The Sun.

'He had this manner that you thought: "What is behind this man? Now we know what was behind it all - which is terrible to find out'.

Jimmy Savile raised as much as £40million for charity is his lifetime, but Sir Bruce said today those who trusted him will be very hurt by the revelations since his death.

He set up the Jimmy Savile Charitable 
Trust and Jimmy Savile Stoke Mandeville Hospital Trust but both have 
been left destroyed by his legacy of abuse.

'I feel sorry for his family and the charity people that put so much trust in him. But of course he was making so much money.'

In
August Savile's image as one of Britain's most famous men and a popular
extrovert was shattered after he died when an ITV investigation 
revealed the shocking scale of his paedophilia.

Some
were abused at his home, others in schools and hospitals he visited, 
and the broadcaster even groped or raped on BBC premises.

It
later emerged that the BBC's Newsnight was also probing his abuse but 
the investigation was dropped just after her died, at the same time as 
the corporation ran tributes to the DJ around Christmas 2011.

Savile
also allegedly molested vulnerable children at Leeds General Infirmary,
including a brain-damaged girl, as well as Stoke Mandeville Hospital, 
where he had his own office, and Broadmoor Hospital.

Distraction Savile raised £40million for charity and earned him a knighthood but it masked decades of abuse

Today officials at Stoke Mandeville Hospital expressed their 'immense regret' for the victims of sex abuser Jimmy Savile.

A statement read: 'These shocking allegations are about serious crimes and it is essential they are first investigated by the police who are the proper criminal authorities and have the expertise, power and experience to uncover the truth and identify criminality, wherever it is.

'The trust is pro-actively working with the police to fully support their investigation.

'We will also act on information the police uncover and provide to us when they have concluded their investigatory and legal processes and ensure that any abuse or misconduct discovered is dealt with.

'We have had a direct dialogue with 
victims who have contacted us in the last few weeks and have heard 
directly, with immense regret, of the harrowing ordeal they experienced 
with Jimmy Savile.

'We
have encouraged all victims to contact the police and have shared with 
police all the information we have identified from our ongoing 
investigation.

'To supplement the work of the police investigation, we are thoroughly reviewing all information available within the trust to establish the processes and arrangements in place over the past forty years.

'We are looking in-depth at Jimmy Savile’s dealings with the hospital and what access he was given.

'This review is being independently overseen by Kate Lampard, on behalf of the Department of Health to ensure that it is robust and any lessons for the NHS can be quickly shared and acted upon.

'We take the protection of our patients very seriously and have clear safeguarding processes in place, particularly for children.

'Our safeguarding procedures have passed all national standards and inspections and are subject to regular and independent assessment.

'In addition to meeting these standards, we are also reviewing our current safeguarding procedures, with the independent Buckinghamshire Safeguarding Children Board, to give our patients, communities and staff the assurances they expect about the quality and safety of their NHS services.'

Since the claims emerged as many as 450 people came forward to say they were targeted by the pa.
