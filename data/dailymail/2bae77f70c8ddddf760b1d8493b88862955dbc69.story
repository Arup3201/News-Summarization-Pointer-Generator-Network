British tourists  were among thousands stranded in the French Alps today as heavy snowfalls left roads impassable and caused at least one fatality.

Worst hit was the Savoie region in south east France, where up to 15,000 people were estimated to be affected.

A 27-year-old man died when his car fell into a ravine in the Belledonne mountain range.

Temporary shelters have been set up in sports centres and town halls in 12 towns to cope with those who were forced to abandon their cars.

Around 15,000 vehicles were stuck in the French Alps today as heavy snowfalls left roads impassable

Hundreds of British holidaymakers travelling from the Channel ports to ski resorts were among those caught up in the chaos.

France's Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said those considering driving should 'exercise the utmost caution' and only travel 'if absolutely necessary'.

Edward Moss, who was travelling from his home in north London to a resort in Switzerland, said: 'Traffic stopped moving as we approached the mountains. Cars were skidding, and the situation became extremely dangerous.

'We checked into a hotel early on as the advice was that we shouldn't take any risks.'

Traveller Kate Rhodes told Sky News: 'I am on a coach with several tired and hungry people. Everyone is fine and the kids are subsisting off Haribo sweets.

'No emergency services to be seen whatsoever or anyone handing out hot drinks and food to weary drivers, many of whom are with small children en route to their holidays, stuck on the road in freezing temperatures.

'The situation is very frustrating. The biggest drama of all is of course most people's phones have run out of battery so they are getting anxious about other friends who are also travelling at this time, and letting family know they are fine.'

A spokesman for France's meteorological centre said more snow was expected and 'significant re-freezing'.

The country declared an orange weather alert - one step under the maximum red alert - in 19 departments. 

Storms packing gusts of up to 160 kilometres per hour forced the temporary closure of France's port of Calais on the English Channel and the suspension of car ferries to and from Britain.
