Bad driver: Anthony Evans-Warner, 17, and his partner-in-crime, 15,  held victim at gunpoint to force him to show them how to drive manually

Two teenage thugs who attempted to steal a car by holding a medical student at gunpoint were forced to give up on their crime when they could not figure out how to operate the stick shift.

Anthony Evans-Warner, 17, and his 15-year-old partner-in-crime set upon a first-year resident at the Baylor School of Medicine in Houston as he was set to leave for the weekend, police have said.

When the teens discovered that they did not know how to drive the car, they threatened the medical student with the gun to force him to show them how to drive manually.

The teens attacked the medical student as he pulled up outside his college accommodation near the NRG Stadium in Houston, The University of Texas At Houston Police Department said.

Evans-Warner pointed a gun at the student, and ordered him to get out of his car.

'The suspects were unfamiliar with the operation of a standard transmission and they tried to get the victim to show them how to drive the standard while he was being held at gunpoint,' Inspector Stefan Happ told Click2Houston.

While being held at gunpoint, the victim showed the teenage thieves how to drive manually, and was thrown out of his car a few blocks away. 

'The officers were chasing the vehicle and apparently they had issues operating the vehicle,' Inspector Happ said.

'They then jumped out of the vehicle and ran on foot.'

Police were soon able to apprehend the culprits and return the car to the male student.

Evans-Warner, 17, has been charged with aggravated robbery with a deadly weapon, and is being held without bail.

The 15-year-old is also being held, but his identity is being withheld due to his young age.
