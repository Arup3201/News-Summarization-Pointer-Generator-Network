She's graced the pages of Sports Illustrated  13 years in a row, forged a career as an actress and even launched a successful brand marketing line.

And last night supermodel Kathy Ireland added another talent to her  impressive portfolio - burping.

At the Miss America pageant taking place in Atlanta City, Ireland, 51, was challenged by host Dena Blizzard to reveal an interesting fact about herself that no one knows.

Ireland claimed she could 'burp the alphabet'.

Blizzard, a former Miss New Jersey and now a stand-up comedian, challenged Ireland to come up on stage and prove it.

Mother-of-three Ireland initially hesitated and admitted she cannot really burp the alphabet. But refusing to lose face, she did let out a loud belch on command, prompting howls of laughter from the audience.

Clearly impressed, Blizzard said: 'You just made supermodels cool!'

The actual talent portion of the evening was won by Miss Kentucky Ramsey Carpenter, who played the fiddle.

'I have been known as the Girl with the Green Fiddle a lot longer than I've been known as Miss Kentucky,' said Carpenter, who has been playing the instrument since age 15.

Now a veteran of the supermodel world, Ireland started in modeling at age 17 and fast became one of the 1980s most popular swimwear models. 

Starting in 1984, she featured in the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue for a whopping 13 consecutive years and graced the cover three times.

After launching a line of socks that became a  hit at Kmart in the early 1990s, Ireland focused on expanding her brand.

The Kathy Ireland brand is now sold across the globe and includes clothes,  rugs, wedding dresses, ceiling fans, carpeting, wigs, futons, jewellery and office furniture.

In addition, she's featured in fitness videos, enjoyed several successful roles as an actress and written a number of books.

Ireland was acting as a celebrity judge at this year's Miss America during the second night of preliminary competition.

Tuesday's talent section was won Miss Ohio Mackenzie Bart, who impressed judges with her ventriloquism routine.

Bart wowed the crowd with a ventriloquism routine in which her dummy appeared to sing the Mary Poppins song 'Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.'

'I was obsessed with Lamb Chop and I loved Shari Lewis,' Bart told reporters later that evening. 

'I used to sit with an old sock and I would mimic what they were doing. I just loved it.' 

Miss Oklahoma Alex Eppler was the winner of yesterday's swimsuit competition. She said she works out two hours a day, five days a week with a trainer, and once ate nine doughnuts in a contest. 

There was considerable uncertainty  as to whether Miss Rhode Island Ivy DePew would be able to take part in the evening's competition.

She collapsed onstage during the first night of preliminaries on Tuesday and was taken to a hospital with what pageant officials revealed to be dehydration.

'She just got a little overheated.'Blizzard told the audience.

DePew rehearsed in the afternoon, then began to feel ill again and went back again to the hospital, but she was released in time to compete that evening. 

She performed 'The Devil Went Down To Georgia' on the flute, and used her personal introduction speech to make a wry reminder of her ordeal.

'I'd like to thank out sponsor, AtlanticCare Regional Medical Center,' she said.

In Tuesday night's preliminary round, Miss Florida Victoria Cowen won the swimsuit competition.

The next Miss America will be crowned in Sunday night's nationally televised finale.
