There has been no bigger beneficiary from Alastair Cook’s demise as England one-day captain than Ian Bell who has stepped up from the Sri Lankan sidelines to become a thoroughly modern World Cup opener in a couple of easy strides.

Bell’s participation in the biggest tournament in one-day cricket was in doubt when he was left out after two matches of England’s tour of Sri Lanka but the late switch away from Cook gave him a lifeline he has gratefully seized.

Now after following up his 187 in a warm-up match in Canberra with a dreamy unbeaten 88 against India he can reflect on a dramatic switch in one-day fortunes that sees him with one final chance of making a World Cup impact.

‘I still thought I would get on the trip,’ insisted Bell as he reflected on his pre-Christmas plight ahead of Friday’s Tri-series game against Australia. ‘I’m someone with experience who can play in a variety of roles. But I probably didn’t expect to be in this position.

‘When I spoke to Eoin Morgan out here and he said he wanted me to open it was a massive confidence boost. Looking back, my most successful time in one-day cricket came in the two years I opened so I wanted to get back to that.’

His elevation, which was proposed by the England coaches and then endorsed by new captain Morgan, was interpreted by many as a reflection of the ‘old-fashioned’ tactics that had held England back in the limited-overs game.

Yet the coaches still had reservations about Alex Hales' technique and wanted to continue with their original game-plan of having a ‘proper’ batsman at the top of the order to try to bat through the 50 overs. Cook ran out of chances to show he was in good enough form to fulfil the brief so Bell has been able to step up.

England’s classiest Test batsman is clear on his role. 

‘Moeen Ali has come out and had a really good go at the bowlers and I want to be similar to that,’ said Bell. ‘Maybe it will be in a slightly different style, a bit more orthodox, but the important thing is recognising the surface you’re on and putting your foot down if it’s flat or getting through it if it’s doing a bit.’

If England are going to make an impact in the World Cup then they will have to post scores of 300 plus with at least one batsman making the big century or even double hundred that are becoming common place in one-day cricket.

Bell is convinced he can deliver the goods.

‘Opening the batting in those first 10 overs suits my game, certainly in these conditions when there’s more bounce and you can play off the back foot or hit it over the field.

‘I’ve tried to work hard even in Sri Lanka when I wasn’t playing. When you play for England you always try to get better and not stand still. This game is changing all the time and you have to go with that or you get left behind.

‘I wouldn’t say I’ve changed anything dramatically. I wouldn’t say that anything I did the other night or in Canberra was any different. It’s just we’ve given a lot of thought over the last few months as to what we want to do here and it’s about executing that now. There are certain areas we’ve identified.’

It would be a huge boost for England if they could execute those plans against Australia at the Bellerive Oval and they will never have a better chance to end their dismal run of results here as the hosts are missing key players.

Shane Watson became the latest Australian to pull out through injury and he joins Mitchell Johnson, David Warner and George Bailey on the sidelines.

Bell was out first ball to the pace of Mitchell Starc when Australia won in Sydney at the start of this warm-up Tri-series and knows he has to succeed against them if he is to truly establish himself among the leading openers here.

‘I didn’t spend enough time at the crease to lose form,’ said Bell of his golden duck. ‘It was disappointing but those opening 10 overs from Australia were world-class. We have to start well now. It would be good to do it against Australia and kick on from there.’
