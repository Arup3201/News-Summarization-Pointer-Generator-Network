When looking for the perfect hotel, its Wi-Fi service is the most important factor, according to new research.

A survey on important factors when searching for accommodation revealed that 67 per cent of travellers are most concerned with Wi-Fi, above any other factor.

The internet connection ranked higher than the hotel's location, a good night's sleep and friendly staff. 

A new study  found that fast, free Wi-Fi to be most important factor when booking a hotel stay

According to the study, carried out by London's Amba Hotel, 67 per cent of those questioned said that free Wi-Fi would make them more likely to choose accommodation, beating 65 per cent, who would judge a hotel on location.

When rating a hotel that they'd already stayed in, 60 per cent of travellers believed unlimited Wi-Fi was the important factor.

Just 58 per cent cared most about a good night's sleep and only 40 per cent was bothered about hotel staff that were friendly and knowledgeable.

The new four-star Amba Hotel Charing Cross is now open - and offering unlimited Wi-Fi to all guests

1. Free WiFi - 67%

2. Location - 65%

3. Fast WiFi with unlimited downloads - 34%

4. Close to travel hubs - 34%

5. Good bars/restaurants in hotel - 26% 

1. Checking social media - 58%

2. Checking directions - 54%

3. Sending/receiving work emails - 49%

4. Local travel tips - 43%

5. Skype calls - 31% 

More than 1,000 UK travellers were questioned in what they look for in a hotel, as well as those little irritants that ruin their relaxing trip or business stay.

More than a quarter of travellers have complained about slow or hard to use WiFi and a whopping 84 per cent of us have suffered as a result of slow WiFi.

Thirty three per cent were not able to send or receive important work emails, while 27 per cent hadn't been able to contact home and eight per cent of respondents have even lost a client or business opportunity after being let down by slow internet access.

Interestingly, those from from Brighton, Belfast and Southampton were considerably more likely to have complained about slow Wi-Fi, while people from Glasgow, Nottingham and Norwich were the most laid back about staying connected. 

Forget about friendly hotel service! Only 40 per cent of respondents were concerned with knowledgeable staff

Business travellers are especially annoyed if Wi-Fi lets them down - 8% have lost a client due to slow internet

And it’s no surprise that people rate Wi-Fi so highly and get so annoyed when it lets them down; we rely on it heavily when travelling - especially when it comes to checking social media, scouting out travel tips, and even accessing dating sites.  

Belinda Atkins, CEO of the new Amba Hotels said; 'Fast, free, unlimited Wi-Fi is as important to our guests as any other facilities provided by the hotel – it’s actually as important as a good night’s sleep. 

'Our Wi-Fi has no caveats, no loyalty schemes no limit on up or down loading. 

'It’s is the fastest, free, unlimited W-iFi of any Meeting & Events hotel.'
