They don’t call him Dinky for no reason, for this this little foal has been hailed Britain’s smallest donkey.

The miniature donkey weighs just 30lbs and is three times lighter than the average baby horse.

Dinky is no taller than a Wellington boot and is the smallest foal ever born at the Donkey Sanctuary in Sidmouth, Devon.

Vet Elena Barrio, who has been at the sanctuary for nine years said: ‘As his mum is a miniature donkey he's the smallest foal we've ever had - about the size of a dog.

‘To give you an idea he's about 90 pounds lighter than the average thoroughbred horse foal.

‘He's such a beauty and so delicate - small but perfectly formed and perfectly healthy. No wonder his mum is so proud of him.’

The owners of the foal’s mother, Summer, gave her to the charity in June when they could no longer care for her on a farm in Oldham, Manchester.

The Donkey Sanctuary does not allow breeding, but Summer was already pregnant when she was rescued.

Dinky is the 15th foal to be born at the sanctuary this year.

People can visit the site, which is open to visitors, and take part in donkey grooming, nature walks and educational activities.
