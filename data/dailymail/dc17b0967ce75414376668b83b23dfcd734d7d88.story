A 17-year-old boy who murdered a man with a single punch just days after he wildly attacked strangers at random in the street was jailed for life today.

Eden Lomax had been caught on CCTV dealing one-punch knockouts to two innocent men during what he boasted were his personalised ‘bomb’ attacks.

As one victim collapsed unconscious into the entrance of the nearby bus, Lomax was overheard joking: ‘I think he wants an adult day saver’.

First attack: CCTV footage of the first attack where on the night of Friday, 7 June 2013, just seven days before Simon died, Lomax punched a 31-year-old man in the face as stood at a bus stop

Attack: CCTV of the second attack, four days after the first. This time Lomax punched a drunken 41-year-old man without warning after they struck up a conversation

Just three days after the assaults in Bolton town centre the ginger haired teenager fatally set about Simon Mitchell after laughing and telling friends: 'I’m going to bomb him.'

Mr Mitchell, 43, was thumped in the face and sent crashing to the ground after trying to shake Lomax’s hand saying: 'What’s a bomb?'

Then as the victim laying dying on the floor with a fractured skull caused when his head hit the pavement, Lomax retorted: 'That’s a f***ing bomb.'

A 16-year-old boy attempted to tend to the victim but Lomax told him to leave it because 'the piece of s*** deserved it,' it was claimed.

Lomax fled the scene to drink and play computer games at a friend’s house as fork lift truck driver Mr Mitchell lay in the street.

He was pronounced dead in hospital just an hour later from serious head and brain injuries.

Pictures from the horrifying CCTV footage emerged as Lomax was convicted of murder following a two week trial.

Today, he was ordered to serve a mininum of ten years in jail.

Second attack: Lomax punched the victim once in the face, the force of the punch knocked him backwards through the open doors of a waiting bus

Knocked down: Lomax punched 41-year-old Paul Caulderbank with so much force to the back of the head that he fell through the open doors of a nearby stationary bus and remained on the floor until the driver came to assistance

'Bully': Detective Chief Inspector Pete Jackson, of Greater Manchester Police, described Lomax as a 'coward and a bully'

The judge Mr Justice Peter Openshaw said: 'What he did suggests cowardly enthusiasm to resort to violence against men who through drinking were unable to defend themselves.

'Simon Mitchell was vulnerable through drink whereas the defendant is well built, physically fit and strong. Mr Mitchell was inoffensively telling him his problems. The defendant’s reaction was to deliver this punch.'

Manchester Crown Court was told in the days before the tragedy on June 14 Lomax attacked ‘men he didn’t know from Adam’, leaving them prone in the street.

CCTV footage was shown in court of Lomax unleashing a vicious blow to the face of 30-year-old Stephen Swanton at a bus stop on Blackhorse Street, Bolton - because he had put his arm around Lomax and a female friend.

A few seconds pass before Mr Swanton is knocked off his feet by the punch, hitting his head on a nearby wall leaving him unconscious.

Lomax can be then seen walking calmly away while a number of youths run quickly across the road.Further video evidence was served of the incident on June 11 at Bolton bus station, where Lomax punched 41-year-old Paul Caulderbank with so much force to the back of the head that he fell through the open doors of a nearby stationary bus and remained on the floor until the driver came to assistance.

The tragedy occurred after Mr Mitchell, who lived with his father and brother, had spent the afternoon drinking in Bolton with his friend Neil O’Donnell.

He bumped into Lomax who had been watching movies with friends on an Ipad at around 8pm. Mr Mitchell made innocuous remarks expressing his sadness that two of his friends had recently committed suicide.

But Lomax then ‘snapped’, as his own stepfather had also taken his own life and started saying to friends who tried to calm him down: 'I’m going to bomb him. Leave me alone or I’ll fall out with you.'

Mr Mitchell, sensing trouble, offered his hand for Lomax to shake and apologised but the teenager laughed and said ‘if you don’t f*** off I will bomb you.'

One eye witness told the jury: 'Eden asked the man to stop talking about suicide, but he wouldn’t listen. Eden was getting annoyed, his face dropped.

'He was getting aggressive. He was bouncing up and down on his toes. We could tell he was angry by the fact his face went red and serious and he was smiling before.

'The man asked Eden what he meant by his threat to “bomb” him and I was shocked when Eden hit him.

'It was horrible, all you could hear was his head thump. The man had turned his head around and asked what a bomb was, he wasn’t aggressive. Eden punched him and said ‘that’s a bomb.'

The witness rang 999 when he could see Mr Mitchell was not moving and added: 'He wasn’t breathing properly. He was making choking noises and he had turned purple.'

Police attended an address in Little Lever, Bolton, two days after the attack where they arrested Lomax.

In interviews he claimed Mr Mitchell was aggressive and he reacted in self-defence.

Tributes: Mr Mitchell, who lived with his father and brother, had spent the afternoon drinking in Bolton with his friend Neil O¿Donnell. He was found suffering from head injuries

Killed: Simon Mitchell, aged 43, of Bolton, was found collapsed. Simon was taken by ambulance to Royal Bolton Hospital where he was later pronounced dead

He pleaded not guilty to murder but admitted manslaughter and assault occasioning actual bodily harm.

After the case Detective Chief Inspector Pete Jackson, of Greater Manchester Police, said: 'Simon lost his life at the hands of a young thug, who was driven by aggression and pent-up violence and revelled in the fact that he could knock vulnerable people unconscious with a single punch, which he referred to as his "bomb".

'Like all cowards and bullies he targeted people who he knew could not defend themselves or fight back. Twice in the previous week he had knocked vulnerable men to the ground with a single punch for no reason whatsoever.

'It is was tragic way for Simon’s evening to end. It has left his father and family devastated. My thoughts are with them and I hope that the justice delivered today will provide some comfort to them.

'I hope this incident serves as a timely reminder of the real dangers to life involved when people throw a punch. Too many people have lost their lives in such incidents. I would urge people to think before they ever contemplate throwing a punch, you could cost someone their life and spend the rest of your own in a prison cell.”

Prosecutor Robert Hall said: 'Mr Mitchell had the misfortune to come across Lomax and what followed was a tragic, unprovoked and thoroughly unnecessary attack by Lomax when instead he could simply have walked away.

'CCTV footage was shown at the trial as bad character evidence, this depicted the escalating pattern of violence that Lomax demonstrated in the week leading up to this fateful night should act as a severe warning to those who may be inclined to follow Lomax’s bad example.

'Whilst today’s conviction of Eden Lomax is a successful outcome in terms of justice, it does not bring back Mr Mitchell or remove the grief and distress felt by his family and friends. Our thoughts are with them.'
