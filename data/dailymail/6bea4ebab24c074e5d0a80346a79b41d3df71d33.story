Manchester United are considering a fresh move for Thomas Vermaelen.

The Arsenal defender is out of contract at the end of next season and keen to move on to revive his career.

David Moyes was weighing up a move for the Belgium international earlier this year but changed his mind.

Struggled: Thomas Vermaelen only made 14 Premier League appearances for Arsenal last season

National service: Vermaelen is currently with the Belgium squad at the World Cup in Brazil

Vermaelen has suffered at Arsenal after a dip in form last year allowed Per Mertesacker to establish himself alongside Laurent Koscielny.

The 28-year-old is still club captain at Arsenal but only made 14 league appearances last season for Arsene Wenger's side.

United want an experienced centre back and a younger one with the idea the experienced one has knowledge of the Premier League.

Incoming United boss Louis van Gaal knows Vermaelen from his time playing for Ajax and believes he may be worth recruiting in a cut-price deal.

Vermaelen has had interest from Italy - notably Fiorentina - but the chance to play for United would be too good to turn down.

Vermaelen is currently with the Belgium squad at the World Cup so any deal is likely to be completed later in the summer.
