A teenage girl plotted to murder her family using contract killers because they forbid her plans to wed her already married lover.

Manpreet Kaur, 19, was arrested along with five contract killers, after the family's servant was murdered in a bungled attempt to assassinate her parents and brother while they slept in their house in Kanjhla, India.

The teenager allegedly wanted her family dead after they disapproved of her relationship with Gurmeet Singh, a married man from the Ramdasia sect. Her family snubbed her for wanting to marry him.

Harcharan Singh Bhullar from Sangur police said: ‘Manpreet was furious over her family's decision and decided to eliminate her mother, father and brother.’

When Miss Kaur’s family found out about her relationship with Mr Singh, they took her out of school and he was refused entry into her village.

Devastated and angry, Miss Kaur allegedly contacted her family’s former domestic servant Ramu to find contract killers to murder her family, according to the Hinustan Times.

Miss Kaur employed five assassins, promising to pay them 500,000 Rupees (£5,787), to murder her family but the group failed on three occasions.

Their undoing was a third attempt on the night of July 15, police said.

The assassins snuck into the family’s home before killing domestic servant Jarnail Singh, 20, while he slept in the courtyard. The group then fled, believing Miss Kaur’s father Avtar Singh was woken by the disturbance.

As police began their investigations into Mr Singh’s murder, Miss Kaur’s plot was exposed.

The would-be assassins, Karamjit Singh, Sukhwinder Singh, Satgur Singh, Paramjit Singh and Ratandeep Singh, were apprehended on their way to retrieve their payment from Miss Kaur.

Police recovered three motorbikes, a .315 pistol and three bullet cartridges. 

Miss Kaur and the assassins all confessed to their crime.

Policeman Bhullar said the police were also investigating whether Miss Kaur’s lover, Mr Singh played a part in the case.
