The Tory MP who organised a Nazi-themed stag do for a friend and then tried to downplay his role in planning the party, last night announced he would step down at the next election.

Aidan Burley was allowed to remain as MP for Cannock Chase after pictures were published in the Mail on Sunday of him attending the distasteful event – despite a party inquiry last month which called his actions ‘stupid and offensive’.

The Oxford graduate always insisted that the stag do, which took place two years ago in the French ski resort of Val Thorens, was not anti-Semitic.

Happier times: David Cameron with Aidan Burley who announced he was quitting Parliament after a 'difficult time'

Mr Burley, 35, issued a grovelling 
apology after details of the party were revealed, and said he wished he 
had left ‘as soon as I realised what was happening’.

But it later emerged that – as the best man – he had bought a Nazi uniform for the groom.

And he did not leave straight after the meal as he initially told the inquiry, but went on to a local bar with the group.

Labour frontbencher Jon Ashworth 
said: 'It shows huge weakness that David Cameron wasn't prepared to take
 action against his disgraced MP, but it's right that Aidan Burley has 
finally done the right thing in stepping down.

'After
 his behaviour at a stag party where a Nazi uniform was worn and the 
names of Nazi leaders were chanted, his position was completely 
untenable.'

Mr Burley was apparently unaware that donning the outfit was an offence in France, the document claimed.

He
 also said the choice of costume was inspired by the British comic 
association with aspects of the war’ and denied any ‘political 
motivation’.

Guests chanted ‘Hitler, Hitler, 
Hitler’, while one raised a toast to the ‘Third Reich’ during the dinner
 party in December 2011, a police tribunal in Albertville heard.

Mr Burley has repeatedly courted controversy, condemning the London Olympics and taking a phone call while on a visit to Auschwitz

Mr Burley later visited Auschwitz concentration camp but courted more controversy when he was seen using his 
mobile phone there.

Mr Burley was sacked as a ministerial
 aide at the Department for Transport when the details of the party in the ski resort of Val 
Thorens emerged.

The groom was wearing the uniform and guests made toasts to the Third Reich.

In 2012 he caused more upset when he condemned the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympic Games as 'leftie multicultural cr*p'.

He wrote on Twitter: 'The most leftie opening ceremony I have ever seen - more than Beijing, the capital of a communist state!' He later insisted he had been 'misunderstood'.

Tonight Tory chairman Grant Shapps said: 'Aidan has a strong record in his constituency from securing the future of Cannock Chase Hospital, to setting up local job fairs and getting hundreds of people back to work.

'He has served his constituents with dedication and commitment. I wish him the best of luck with whatever he does next.'

Announcing his decision not to stand in 
2015 Mr Burley said: 'It was a wonderful surprise to win the seat of 
Cannock Chase in May 2010 with the biggest swing in the country and it 
has been a huge privilege to represent the people of Cannock Chase in 
Parliament over the past four years.

'I am grateful to all those 
who voted for me and supported our campaign which led to our famous 
victory, winning a seat which had been held by Labour for 18 years.'
