A leading art expert who first beat his wife on their honeymoon 10 years ago walked free from court today despite punching her in front of his two young children.

Art specialist Damian Brenninkmeyer, 42, former head of the Old Masters department at Christie's auction house, first started beating his wife of ten years, Fiona, when the couple were on their honeymoon and she was eight months pregnant with their first child.

The history of violence came to light after the Kingston-upon-Thames resident flew into a rage and lashed out at his 40-year-old wife as he drove her and their two daughters, aged five and seven, along a busy road in west London on July 7 this year.

Just two days earlier he had been given a police caution for assaulting his wife by dousing her with water at their luxury home, magistrates were told.

Brenninkmeyer, a member of the Dutch dynasty that owns the C&A chain store, admitted assaulting his wife.

However, he was handed a four month prison sentence, suspended for 18 months, at Hammersmith Magistrates’ Court.

He was also made the subject of a restraining order, banning him from contacting his wife and from their family home in Fulham for six months.

He was also ordered to take a domestic violence rehabilitation course and told to pay £120 in costs.

Helen Clutton, prosecuting, said: 'Mrs Brenninkmeyer says that she has been a victim of domestic violence since she was pregnant with her first child.

'When she was eight months pregnant 
they were on their honeymoon when he hit her, put his hand round her 
neck and pushed her onto the bed and hit her.'

But Brenninkmeyer insists he is desperate to save his marriage.

The court heard he was fuming at his spouse for calling the police two days before and hit her across the face as a 'punishment' in front of their two young daughters as they were driving to his mother-in-law’s Buckinghamshire home.

Just two days before the attack he had returned home in a violent temper and doused his wife with water, causing her to flee and hide from him in the bedroom, the court heard.

He shouted at his wife ‘I want to 
punish you for what you did to me’ and had earlier warned her: ‘I’m 
going to break your phone and tell the accountant not to allow you to 
have another.’

She pleaded 
with him to stop, begging him: ‘Please calm down for the kids!’ But he 
bashed his fist against the steering wheel and hit her across the face.

His wife then fled the car at a service station and broke down in tears with her two children.

Describing the attack, Mrs Clutton said: 'She could sense that Mr Brenninkmeyer was in a bad mood, but he assured her everything was going to be okay and that he wasn’t angry with her.

'They were driving along the Fulham Palace Road when he became aggressive towards her and shouted: ‘I want to punish you for what you did to me’.

'The children were in the car when he was saying this and they were awake.

'He said ‘I’m going to break your phone and tell the accountant not to allow you another one.'

She pleaded with him to calm down 'for the children' but the art specialist lashed out and hit her against her right cheek as he drove 'erratically' down the road.

Mrs Clutton said: 'He grabbed her phone and grabbed her sunglasses and threw them out of the window.

'Throughout the journey the right of her face was throbbing and she could see bruising.'

His wife then fled out of the car at Beaconsfield services and broke down in tears.

But she eventually got back into the car and returned home after Mr Brenninkmeyer said: ‘Why don’t you get back in the car? You’re causing a scene.'

The couple returned home but another row erupted that night when Brenninkmeyer discovered his wife had taken money from their joint account to pay a cleaner and he pushed her down on to a sofa.

Sentencing him, District Judge Andrew Sweet said the time Mr Brenninkmeyer spent in custody was 'nothing in comparison with what you put your wife through'.

'He has anger management issue he is addressing. Given the right circumstances, he hopes his marriage can be saved'

- Mark Haslam, in mitigation

He added: 'An aggravating feature is that your children were in the car.

'What they are thinking, we don’t know. It is all about you exercising power in your relationship in a bullying way.'

Mark Haslam, in mitigation, said his client was on medication and was desperate to save his marriage.

Mr Halsam said Brenninkmeyer 'bitterly regretted' assaulting his wife 'especially in front of the children'.

He said: 'He has anger management issue he is addressing.

'Given the right circumstances, he hopes his marriage can be saved.'

He also said that spending two nights in custody was 'a salutary experience, especially for a man of his background'.

Brenninkmeyer, who pleaded guilty to assault at an earlier hearing, stood with his head bowed as the judge passed sentence.

Speaking with a hint of a Dutch accent, he only spoke to confirm his name, age and address and refuse to comment as he left court this afternoon.

The court heard how Mr Brenninkmeyer’s wife has declared she wants a six month 'cooling off period' during which time she won’t see her husband. Brenninkmeyer, who is living with his father, will continue to see their two children.

His sister Chantal is a 'trusted' friend and relative who will mediate between the couple, the court heard.

Brenninkmeyer worked at Christie’s until 2010 and has also previously worked for London auctioneers Bonhams & Butterfields.

He is currently the London director of Vienna auction house Dorotheum, has been undergoing treatment for anxiety.
