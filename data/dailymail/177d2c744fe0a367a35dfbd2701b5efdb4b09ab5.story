Chef Albert Roux has been spotted stepping out for the first time with the girlfriend who cost him his marriage after being granted a decree nisi in the courts.

The 78-year-old self- confessed womaniser took glamorous Ukrainian Nataliya Lutsyshyna, out  for supper last Thursday and chose perhaps the most obvious restaurant in London for the occasion.

Guests at Le Gavroche were surprised to see the portly Frenchman, whose name once adorned the menu, take a seat at the top table where he and Miss Lutsyshyna, 40, enjoyed a meal with friends.

The couple are said to have become ‘inseparable’ in recent months, with Mr Roux lavishing gifts including a BMW, Chanel handbags and holidays on his latest prize.

Miss Lutsyshyna has a grown-up son and met Mr Roux while working as a cloakroom attendant at his London restaurant, Roux at Parliament Square.

Sources say it was the couple’s close friendship that led to the breakdown of his marriage to his South African-born wife, Cheryl, 57.

One friend of the estranged couple said: ‘Cheryl was convinced something was going on with Nataliya. Her suspicions have now been confirmed.’

Mrs Roux filed for divorce last year. She said her husband had ‘committed adultery with a woman, the identity of whom is known to me, at various times and at various locations, including the marital home and bed’.

In an exclusive interview with this newspaper, Mr Roux admitted he had seen Miss Lutsyshyna on a handful of occasions in the run-up to the end of his marriage. He said: ‘I do go out with her now and again but with others as well.’

A source said: ‘Albert is very taken with Nataliya. One gets the impression he is rather proud of his latest conquest.’
