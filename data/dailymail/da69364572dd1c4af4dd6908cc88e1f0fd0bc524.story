The coffin of a revered Turkish historical figure has been given a new resting place, after the country sent hundreds of soldiers into Syria to prise it from the grip of Islamic State militants.

Soldiers re-interred the remains of Suleyman Shah, whose grandson Osman I founded the Ottoman Empire in the 12th Century, after yesterday evacuating it from Aleppo Province.

Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan today denied the move was a retreat, instead calling it 'a temporary move in order not to risk soldiers' lives,' after militants threatened to attack the tomb.

Nearly 600 Turkish soldiers and 100 armoured vehicles entered Syria to evacuate the crypt and the men guarding it, in an act Syria denounced as 'flagrant aggression'.

Although the tomb is located 25 miles away from the frontier, Turkey regards it as sovereign territory and Turkish soldiers had been guarding it since the start of  Syria's civil war.

Its location, in Karakozak village, north-east of Aleppo, had been surrounded by ISIS fighters. Suleyman's remains were relocated to a spot just a few hundred feet from the border, on a patch of high ground visible from Turkey.

The Syrian government last night said it would hold Ankara responsible for any repercussions from what it called an act of 'flagrant aggression'.

Damascus said the Turkish government had informed the Syrian consulate in Istanbul about the operation to relocate the tomb, but had not awaited Syria's agreement.

A statement on Syrian television said the fact Islamic State militants had not attacked the tomb 'confirmed the depth of the ties between the Turkish government and this terrorist organisation'.

The overnight operation to secure Suleyman's remains was split in two, with one group crossing into Syria to reach the tomb to repatriate the soldiers and extract the remains of Suleyman Shah

A second group took control of an area just 650 feet from the Turkish border where authorities planned to move the tomb, Turkish media reported.

Turkish tanks late on Saturday sped through the shattered streets of Kobane - the city now controlled by Kurdish fighters after a months long battle with jihadists - on their way to the tomb.

In a hugely symbolic move, the troops also raised their flag over a new area of raised ground inside Syria but easily visible from the Turkish border. Images taken from the border indicated that this spot in the in the Syrian district of Eshme was the location of Suleyman's new tomb.

There were reportedly 40 Turkish soldiers guarding the mausoleum complex by the Euphrates River, which under a 1920s treaty is considered sovereign Turkish territory. 

It carries huge symbolic importance to Turks as a link to their pre-Ottoman past.

After taking everything of historical value, the Turkish troops detonated the building that housed the tomb so it was not misused afterwards by jihadists, Turkish media said.

One soldier was killed in an accident during the operation, Prime Minister Davutoglu said.

'We had given the Turkish armed forces a directive to protect our spiritual values and the safety of our armed forces personnel,' Mr Davutoglu said in televised remarks.

Mr Davutoglu said on Twitter that the remains of Suleyman would be moved to a different area of Syria which had been brought under Turkish military control.

He said that 572 Turkish soldiers using 39 tanks, 57 armoured vehicles and 100 other military vehicles took part in the operation.

A government official said that warning shots had been fired to prevent any danger from IS.

Announcing the operation to the Turkish public, President Erdogan said: 'Our flag will continue to fly in a new place to keep alive the memory of our ancestors.'

The figure of Suleyman helps Turks link the Ottoman dynasty, which according to tradition was founded by Osman in 1299, with the early Turkic tribes who swept through Anatolia from Asia.

'A nation cannot build a future without a past and symbols of the past,' said Mr Davutoglu.

The operation was launched 11 months after ISIS militants threatened to launch an attack on the tomb unless Turkey removed its troops within three days.

At the time, the Turkish government responded that any attack on the location of the tomb would be considered an attack on Turkish soil.

It is not the first time the tomb has been relocated - it was moved in the 1970s when its then location, also on the Euphrates, was flooded by the Syrian authorities to construct the Tabqa Dam that forms Lake Assad.

The tomb had for years been watched over largely by conscripts but in March 2014 Turkey reportedly sent several dozen special forces to guard it.

Turkic leader Suleyman Shah was born circa 1178, and was the grandfather of Osman I, the founder of the Ottoman Empire.

He is believed to have drowned in the Euphrates around 1236.

His followers headed north into what is today Turkey, where they launched the Ottoman Empire.

Following the collapse of the Ottoman Empire in the wake of World War I, a treaty was signed between Turkey and France, then the colonial power in Syria.

The 1921 Treaty of Ankara assigned an area of 8,000 sq.m. north-east of Aleppo, containing the tomb, to remain Turkish territory.

The location of the tomb was flooded in 1973 due to the building of a new dam, and Turkey moved the mausoleum.

Some historians question official accounts about the Shah's tomb, saying they might have been retrospectively concocted to enrich an imperial identity for Turks. 

The operation to evacuate the soldiers guarding the tomb took place as Turkey comes under pressure from its Western allies to play a greater role in the fight against IS jihadists.

The U.S. and Turkey on Thursday signed a deal to train and equip thousands of moderate Syrian rebel forces opposing Assad after several weeks of talks.

Turkey's opposition angrily lashed out at the government over the operation, accusing it of dressing up a military withdrawal as a victory.

'For the first time in the history of the Turkish Republic, we are losing territory without fighting for it,' said Gursel Tekin of the opposition Republican People's Party (CHP).

Kobane was the focus of U.S. airstrikes as Kurdish forces battled militants of the Islamic State group, who hold about a third of Iraq and neighboring Syria in their self-declared caliphate.

Turkey stayed out of the battle at the time, which saw Kurds ultimately push out the extremists.

The U.S.-led coalition forces were informed of the Turkish operation after its launch to prevent any casualties, Mr Davutoglu said. 

U.S. officials offered no immediate comment.
