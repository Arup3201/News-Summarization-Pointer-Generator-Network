Jewish communities put on a colourful display in north London over the weekend to celebrate the festival of Purim. 

The carnival-like holiday is marked by parades and costume parties with participants dressing up in masks and fancy dress outfits.

The holy day commemorates the salvation of the Jewish people in ancient Persia during the 5th century BC when Royal adviser Haman plotted 'to destroy, kill and annihilate all the Jews, young and old, infants and women, in a single day'.

The ancient story is recorded in the book of Esther in the Hebrew Bible.

It tells how a royal adviser to King Ahasuerus - presumed to be Xerxes I of Persia - called Haman planned to kill all the Jews in the empire.

But his plans were foiled by Mordecai and his adopted daughter Queen Esther. 

While huge celebrations were held in 
Israel and around the world, Orthodox children in London donned fancy dress outfits to take part in a
parade on a double decker bus.

Children wore an array of costumes - from bear outfits, police uniforms to clown make-up and even ballgowns.

Purim is celebrated annually on the 14th day of the Hebrew month of Adar - the day following the victory over the plot.

It is the one day of the year where Jewish people are encouraged to get 'shikker' - a Yiddish term for extremely drunk - and to eat, drink and be merry.

Drunkenness is usually discouraged by Jewish law but it is considered a mitzvah - religious duty - to drink alcohol on Purim although followers are still expected to perform all other duties of the festival.

As well as parades and fancy dress, Purim is celebrated by the giving of food and drink to other Jews and through charity to the poor.

Traditionally, there is also a celebratory meal and a public recitation of the Scroll of Esther which every Jew must hear once during the day and once at night.
