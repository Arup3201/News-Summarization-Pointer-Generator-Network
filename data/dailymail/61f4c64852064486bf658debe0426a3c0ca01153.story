A Canadian tourist with several previous child sex convictions has been sentenced to seven years in Nepal prison for sexually abusing a boy. 

Ernest Fenwick MacIntosh, 71, a businessman from the province of Nova Scotia, was also ordered to pay $10,000 to the victim by the judge in his ruling on Sunday, according to Lalitpur District Court.

MacIntosh lured the boy, who has only one arm, to his hotel room in Lalitpur, a suburb south of the capital, Kathmandu, and repeatedly molested him, according to the Globe and Mail.

Ernest Fenwick MacIntosh, 71, a businessman from the province of Nova Scotia, was sentenced to seven years in prison in Nepal for sexually molesting a boy (above Nepalese police escorting MacIntosh to his final hearing on Sunday)

He arrived in Nepal on a tourist visa in August 2014 and was a frequent visitor to the children's shelter where the boy lived, and also gave the child promises of paying for a prosthetic arm while also offering him gifts and money.

MacIntosh was detained by the police in December after the victim filed a complaint with police. Details of the victim were not given because he is a minor. 

MacIntosh previously faced 17 child sex offense convictions  after being accused of sexually abusing boys in the 1970s, and the allegations surfaced in 1995, when he was living in India.

However, he was not extradited until 2007 and the first of his two trials in Nova Scotia did not start until 2010. 

The 17 sex-related convictions against him, involving three boys, were overturned in April 2013. 

He was also ordered to pay $10,000 to the victim who he repeatedly molested at his hotel

Bob Martin, 57, one of six men who led to the Nova Scotia convictions said Nepalese officials finally brought a serial child predator to justice.

He said: 'It's deplorable, even embarrassing, that a foreign country has to make up for the inadequacies of the Canadian justice system.'

Police are investing to discover if there were any other minors involved.
