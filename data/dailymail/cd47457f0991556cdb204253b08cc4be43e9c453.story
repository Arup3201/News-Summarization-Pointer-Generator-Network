Celta Vigo forward Fabian Orellana has been handed a one-match ban by the Spanish football federation following his straight-red card for throwing grass at Barcelona midfielder Sergio Busquets, the club has confirmed on their official website. 

The bizarre incident which happened during Barca's 1-0 victory over Celta on Sunday saw Orellana grow frustrated with Busquets' time-wasting tactics and hurl a lump of turf at him.   

Naturally, Busquets made the most of the contact and grabbed his eye, despite the grass clearly striking him on the back of the neck.

In any case though it was enough for referee Inaki Vicandi Garrido to decide that Orellana was worthy of receiving his marching orders. 

The 1-0 defeat by Barcelona leaves Celta 11th in the league table with 35 points, comfortable mid-table and safe from relegation.  

Orellana will miss his side's next game against Granada on Wednesday night.
