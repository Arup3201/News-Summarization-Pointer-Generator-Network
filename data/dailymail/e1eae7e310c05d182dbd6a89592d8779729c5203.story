Ivanka Trump has shared another picture-perfect snap from her family vacation in Aspen, this time of herself and her seven-year-old niece Kai Madison. 

Just hours after posting an image of her adorable three-year-old daughter Arabella building her first snowman, the 33-year-old heiress took to Instagram again to express her pride at Kai's impressive skiing skills. 

'I'm so proud of my niece Kai for carving up the mountain today! #LittleShredder' she commented alongside an image of the duo posing atop an Aspen mountain in their full ski gear.

Family affair: Ivanka's older brother Donald Trump Jr (L), tweeted this image of himself and his wife Vanessa (C), taking their nine-month-old daughter Chloe (R) on her first ever gondola ride

Kai is the eldest child of Ivanka's older brother Donald Trump Jr and his wife Vanessa. 

The two siblings are currently enjoying a spring break getaway together with both of their families, including Ivanka's children - Arabella, three, and Joseph, one - and Donald's five children - Kai, Donald John III, six, Tristan, three, Spencer, two, and Chloe, who is just nine-months-old. 

Earlier this week, Donald shared a snap of his youngest child Chloe enjoying her first ever gondola ride, explaining to his Twitter followers that the tot was a 'ski bum in the making'. 

'Chloe's first gondola ride with @MrsVanessaTrump #Aspen ski bum in the making,' he commented alongside the image of himself, wife Vanessa and Chloe. 

The 37-year-old businessman added: 'Après ski ain't what it used to be!'

Over the weekend, Ivanka took a break from the slopes in order to help her daughter build her very first snowman yesterday during their family vacation in Aspen – and, unsurprisingly, Arabella chose to name her snowy creation after a character from Frozen.

The 33-year-old businesswoman shared an image of her precious daughter decorating her masterpiece with pine cones while she kept warm in a bright fuchsia snow suit and a knit hat topped with a pom pom, while commenting that the process of creating the snowman wasn't as easy as she thought it would be. 

Magical moment: Ivanka, 33, snapped this photo of her three-year-old daughter Arabella making her first snowman on Sunday, which she named after the Frozen character Olaf

Disney inspired: Last summer, Arabella had a Frozen-themed birthday party where she dressed as Elsa 

'Making a snowman was much harder than I expected! Alas... meet Olaf (big surprise on the name selected). Arabella's very first snowman!' she captioned the Instagram photo yesterday. 

Nearly 10,000 people commented on the snapshot of Arabella's smiling face, with one fan writing: 'Family and cousin bonding in Aspen... can't get any better than that. Love the pine cone placement.'

Another person praised Ivanka's parenting style, saying: 'She is just so pretty. I admire the hands-on mom that you are.'

This isn’t the first time that Arabella’s fondness for the hit Disney movie Frozen has been documented on her mother’s Instagram account; last summer, the mother-of-two threw her daughter a Frozen-themed birthday party, posting a picture of the youngster posing in front of a Frozen-themed cake, while wearing a Princess Elsa costume. 

Last week, the dedicated mother-of-two skipped a session at the gym in favor of indulging in a unique 'spin' session with her two children at home.

Ivanka shared two images of herself spinning Arabella and her one-year-old son Joseph around in an office chair, commenting on the Instagram snap that the trio's playtime session was serving as her morning workout.

Throwback: Ivanka shared this childhood image of herself enjoying a skiing session with her mother Ivana

'Nothing like a morning spin session to get my day started right!' she wrote, before adding: 'Their adorable squealing was the best part!'  

The adorable photos, which were uploaded as one collage, have already received numerous comments from Ivanka's followers, with many praising the busy mom for her ability to balance her work life with having fun at home. 

'My new role model lol. Bad a** hot business woman like me (sic),' one person wrote. 

Another added: 'You are a great role model for so many young women! Thank you!'

And it seems that the fun picture may have made Ivanka feel a bit nostalgic; just a few hours after sharing the image with her 500,000 followers, the former model posted one of her own childhood snaps, apparently taken on one of the Trump family's skiing vacations. 

'This picture makes me smile - some of my favorite childhood memories took place on the slopes,' she commented on the throwback picture, which shows her as a young girl enjoying a session on the slopes alongside her mother Ivana. 

Happy families: Ivanka has been married to real estate investor Jared Kushner (pictured with their children) for four years

She then added: 'In honor of next week's family vacation to #Aspen, this #TBT features my first (and favorite!) ski instructor. #thanksmom #familyvacation'

No doubt the family's holiday will continue to provide plenty of material for Ivanka's Instagram account, which regularly features candid snaps of her two children - and their father, Ivanka's husband of four years, Jared Kushner.

Earlier this month, Ivanka spoke with Vogue magazine about how her decision to convert to Judaism has actually helped her to spend more quality time with her two children.   

'I really find that with Judaism, it creates an amazing blueprint for family connectivity,' she told the magazine. 'We observe the Sabbath. From Friday to Saturday we don’t do anything but hang out with one another. We don’t make phone calls.'

Ivanka added that turning her phone off for 25 hours is something  her children have really learned to appreciate as well.

'For Arabella to know that she has me, undivided, one day a week? We don’t do anything except play with each other, hang out with one another [and] go on walks together. Pure family,' she said.
