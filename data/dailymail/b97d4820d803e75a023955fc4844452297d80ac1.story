With full make-up and a glossy blow-dry, this female bank robber certainly looks her best - although perhaps a mask to conceal her identity might have been more fitting.

The surveillance footage from inside the Chase branch clearly shows a 5'7, brunette woman in her twenties, approaching the teller alone and demanding money.

The heist was carried out just before 6pm on Monday at a Chase bank in Scottsdale, Arizona.

The woman walked up to a male bank employee behind the counter and showed him a demand letter, according to Scottsdale police.

She then fled the building with an undisclosed number of bills and was seen getting into a gold, mid-sized sedan being driven by another person. The vehicle was last seen heading towards Scottsdale Road.

No weapon was used in the robbery and no one was injured in the attack. The thief, who has long, dark hair, was wearing glasses and dressed in boots, a black, belted coat and red gloves.

The suspect has not been located or identified at this time and the investigation is ongoing.

Officers asked anyone with information to contact the Scottsdale Police Department.
