Former New England Patriots player Aaron Hernandez's DNA matched genetic material found on a cigarette butt at the scene of a murder, a crime lab scientist testified on Friday.

Hernandez is on trial for murder in the June 2013 killing of Odin Lloyd, who was dating the sister of Hernandez's fiancee. 

Lloyd's body was found in an industrial park near Hernandez's home, and prosecutors have said previously a marijuana cigarette was found near his bullet-riddled body.

Diane Fife Biagiotti of the state police crime lab told jurors that she received rolling paper from a 2-inch-long cigarette butt to test for DNA. She said she found it had the DNA of at least two people on it.

She said she first compared it with Lloyd's DNA and discovered he could have been one of the people whose DNA appeared on the butt. She said she then was able to use Lloyd's DNA to deduce the second DNA contributor.

'I did a comparison between the profile I deduced and the profile of Aaron Hernandez,' she said. 

'I found that the profile from Aaron Hernandez matched the deduced DNA profile.'

She then ran a statistical analysis and determined the likelihood it was someone else is one in more than a quadrillion.

'How many zeros does a quadrillion have?' prosecutor William McCauley asked her?

'One with 15 zeros after it,' she replied.

He then asked her the world's population: 7 billion - and pointed out a quadrillion is one million times a quadrillion.

But Hernandez lawyer James Sultan went after other DNA evidence in the case, including some collected from a spent shell casing found inside a car Hernandez rented.

Police found the casing in a trash bin at an Enterprise rental car, stuck to some blue bubble gum. 

An Enterprise employee said she found both items under the driver's seat of the car and threw them away.

Biagiotti testified she found Hernandez DNA on the shell casing, but she also acknowledged she did not know the gum had been stuck to the shell before she did her test.

'Would you agree with me, Ms. Biagiotti, that there is a high likelihood that the DNA contained in the saliva on a chewed blue chewing gum would be transferred to that shell casing?' Sultan asked.

'Yes, I would agree with that,' she said.

She also acknowledged that it is uncommon to find a testable amount of DNA on a spent cartridge casing and that the lab had never tested the chewing gum for DNA. Sultan also asked her if she had received a DNA profile for Hernandez co-defendant Ernest Wallace to compare it with evidence in the case. She said she had not.

Wallace and another man, Carlos Ortiz, have also been charged in the killing. They have pleaded not guilty and will be tried separately.

The court heard on Thursday that a tread mark found near the body of a man allegedly killed by Aaron Hernandez was made by a tire from a car rented by the ex-NFL star.

Massachusetts State Police Trooper Todd Girouard, who specializes in tire track analysis, said the rear passenger side tire of a Nissan Altima that prosecutors say was rented by Hernandez matched a track found at a North Attleboro industrial park where the body of Odin Lloyd was found in June 2013.

Girouard, the state police trooper, said four small stones lodged in the tire of the Altima corresponded to tracks from the industrial park, based on his analysis, which included comparing photographs and test prints of the tire. 

He said the believed the tire on the Altima 'made the impression.'

Lloyd's sister testified earlier she saw her brother getting into a silver Nissan outside their home in Boston's Dorchester neighborhood hours before he was killed. 

Prosecutors have shown surveillance video of Hernandez and Ortiz getting out of a silver Altima at a gas station in Canton, Massachusetts, hours before the murder.

Also on Thursday, Patrick Quinn, a T-Mobile engineer, identified the locations of cell towers that connected with Lloyd's phone, beginning in Boston and moving to the coverage area of the North Attleborough industrial area, in the early morning hours of June 17, 2013.

Earlier, Carol Martin Bailey, a resident of a condominium complex where Hernandez rented a unit in Franklin, Massachusetts, said she met a man she identified as George who appeared to be Ernest Wallace. 

The man told her he was moving into the next door unit with his cousin, she said, describing him as 'extremely nice'.
