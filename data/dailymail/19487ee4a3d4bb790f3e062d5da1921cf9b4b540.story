This is the abandoned wasteland which was once a cutting edge ski-slope used to train the stars of Team GB for the Winter Olympics.

The Sheffield Ski Village was once the beloved training venue for James Woods, 21, James Machon, 23, and Katie Summerhayes, 18 - half of Team GB's Freestyle Skiing team (Freeski).

But since April 2012 it has suffered several fires - some of which were arson - and Sheffield Council has condemned it as 'a hot spot for vandalism and fly-tipping'.

Now all that remains as a reminder of the sites former glory are a few signs, some dry ski slope bristles and the odd abandoned ski.

The owner of the 16.5 acre site has now applied to build 70 houses on it. But Pat Sharples, head coach of Team GB's Freeski team, said the athletes' success was due to the ski village.

He said: 'Sheffield Ski Village had to be one of the UK's standout slopes for me. It was the first place that really invested in a full freestyle arena and the first dry slope in the UK to have a half pipe.

'To succeed in alpine skiing, you have to have a lot of money behind you. But with freestyle skiing, no way. From a hillside in Sheffield came the extreme skiing of the Chamonix Valley.'

The slopes have been ripped apart after years of vandalism and the site has become little more than dumping ground flytippers

Half of Team GB's freestyle skiers at the 2014 Winter Olympics, which is taking place in Sochi, Russia, learned their tricks at Sheffield Ski Village. Now it has gone, there is a question mark over where South Yorkshire's next generation of Olympians will come from

The slope was opened in 1988 when the city council donated a patch of land on a disused  quarry next to a tip. This evolved into the ski village, a collection of spiky plastic ski slopes overlooking the city

Sheffield Ski Village was once the go- to slope for aspiring winter athletes. But soon the trend for dry ski slopes was taken over by modern indoor snow domes

Skiers and snowboarders at the slope, in its heyday, before arson attacks and modern training techniques saw it rendered little more than a rubbish tip

A thing of its time, Sheffield Ski Village was the first place that really invested in a full freestyle arena and the first dry slope in the UK to have a half pipe

But since it fell into disrepair 
the owner of the 16.5 acre site has now applied to build 70 houses on it - to the dismay of the stars who honed their sport on the slopes

The once beloved site has been strewn with rubbish and apparently become a dumping ground for flytippers. It now seems there is little chance of it being returned to its former glory as one of the most beloved slopes to today's Winter Olympians

Katie Summerhayes started skiing aged six and was taken to the Ski Village every Saturday by her dad who saw the white slopes while working at the top of a tower block in Sheffield

Overgrown moguls on the slope are almost completely unrecognisable after weeds and brambles have reclaimed the site

Mr Sharples added: 'To succeed in alpine skiing, you have to have a lot of money behind you. But with freestyle skiing, no way. From a hillside in Sheffield came the extreme skiing of the Chamonix Valley'

Amid the rubbish and mud, small glimpses of greenery can be seen creeping through the gaps

Sochi 2014 Olympian James Woods was last season's number one for slope style freeski and won silver at the 2013 World Cup. He said his life would have been very different if it had not been for Sheffield Ski Village

It seems that since the arson attacks, some of the slope ski lodges have been used for less than sporting purposes

Sheffield Council has condemned it as 'a hot spot for vandalism and fly-tipping' after a number of arson attacks since 2012
