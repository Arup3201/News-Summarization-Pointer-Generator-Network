If your mother ever told you to stop playing with your food, she'll certinaly swallow her words when she catches sight of Akihiro Mizuuchi's new project.

The Japanese illustrator and designer has combined the two things of everyones' dreams into one perfect product: chocolate LEGO.

Mr Mizuuchi created the edible building blocks by first pouring the chocolate into perfectly designed moulds where it was left to cool and set, acording to Colossal.

Once set, they were simply popped out and ready to be used as everyday LEGO.

The designer even demonstrated the effectivness of his invention by building three adorable and delicious looking bears.

Chocolate and lego loving Twitter users have already expressed their love for the idea online.

However a number of concerns have been raised about the product by social media users who have admitted they aren't sure how long their structures would last before being sampled.

'Omnom: Chocolate LEGO Bricks Satisfy Your Sweet Tooth and the Nerd in You,' Kenneth Falck wrote on Twitter.

Tegan Higginbotham ‚Äècommented: 'The idea of Chocolate Lego is indeed wonderful. But this quaint notion that the chocolate will last long enough for me to build stuff? HA!'.

'Edible chocolate LEGO that actually fit together. The dream is real,' Chris Marsh said.

It may be some time before the product actually takes off however, as Mr Mizuuchi's idea is not available at supermarkets or shopping centres, rather just exisiting as a project.
