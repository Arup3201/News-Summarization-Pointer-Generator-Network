Conrad Truman smiles in court on Monday before he was sentenced to life in prison for his wife's murder 

A husband sentenced to life in prison for his wife's murder refused to apologize to her family in court on Monday as he insisted that he didn't kill her.

Conrad Mark Truman, 32, was given 15 years to life in prison for the murder of 25-year-old Heidy Truman and up to 15 years for obstruction of justice, to run consecutively.

He refused to apologize during the court hearing in Provo, Utah, claiming that he was not responsible and that his wife committed suicide. 

'I did not kill my wife… I can't say sorry for something I did not do. 

'I won't say sorry. It's not my fault that she shot herself,' Truman said, according to sltrib.com, during a rambling half-hour speech.

The 32-year-old said he would never give up fighting his murder conviction as it was a 'big injustice', adding that the evidence was circumstantial.  

Mrs Truman's family were in court to watch her husband sentenced but the victim's mother, Janet Wagner, opted to leave the room while the killer made his statement. 

His attorney Ron Yengich said in court that his client plans to appeal. 

Heidy Truman was found dead from a gunshot wound to the head at the couple's Orem, Utah home on September 30, 2012.

Truman had claimed that his wife either committed suicide or was gunned down by a stranger  outside the home.

During his trial, police officers testified that Truman's bizarre behavior following his wife's shooting raised suspicion.

Truman had reported his wife's death during an emotional 911 call. 

'There's so much blood. If they don't get here right now, she's gonna die,' he wailed in the call, which was played at his preliminary hearing in 2013.  

'I don't know what happened. I really don't know what happened, I swear to God. She was in the shower, she came out of the shower and I heard a pop, and there's blood, and she's in blood. 

Later, he shouted on the call: 'If you don't get here quick, my wife's life is on your head. My wife.'

After officers arrived, they found the home in disarray, blood spatter throughout and Mrs Truman naked in the bathroom with a single bullet wound to her head. 

An investigation found she had been shot at close-range. 

A police officer also testified during the trial last year that when officers responded to the home after the 911 call, they found Mr Truman kissing her feet and saying he was sorry .

Officer Art Lopez told the court last October that Truman was threatening to kill the officers if they didn't save his wife.

Officers added that Truman had allowed the couple's dogs to walk through evidence and he went to the bathroom without a police officer, the court heard. 

Prosecutors said that Truman killed his wife so he could collect her $878,000 life-insurance policy.

Before the shooting, Truman and his wife of three years had been watching TV show Dexter and drinking whiskey.

Truman's defense team argued that the reason he gave confused accounts of what had happened was because he was drunk and had just found his wife shot dead.

However after giving conflicting accounts, officers later tried to question Truman - but he failed to return their phone calls and refused to speak to them at his workplace.

Following an investigation into the death, he was eventually arrested during a traffic stop in July 2013, nearly a year after his wife died.
