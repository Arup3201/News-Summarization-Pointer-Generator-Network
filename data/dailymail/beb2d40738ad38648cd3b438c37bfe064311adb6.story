Stavropol's Federal University confirmed all four students were expelled       

A university student has been jailed in Russia for posing for a photograph in front of a Second World War memorial - arm in arm with a blow-up sex doll.

Anastasia Polnikova, 23, was charged with hooliganism after she and three friends took the inflatable sex aid to the memorial near the Federal University in Stavropol, Russia.

Wearing WWII head gear and waving a Russian flag, the drunk students borrowed the doll from a friend and walked through the park to take the pictures before posting them on the internet.

Detectives are hunting Miss Polnikova's three unnamed friends who went on the run after police issued arrest warrants for them all.

who appeared in this photo are known to us and they will all be 
punished.

She and three pals had posed drunkenly in front of a tank with the blow up sex doll at the memorial to the Great Patriotic War, Russia's name for WWII.
