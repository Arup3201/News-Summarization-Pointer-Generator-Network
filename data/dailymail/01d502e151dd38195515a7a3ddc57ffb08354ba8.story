People sporting muffin tops, beer bellies and love handles are twice as likely to develop a serious heart problem than their thinner counterparts.

While obesity has long been seen as a risk to heart health, new research shows midriff bulge has been linked to a sudden, and often fatal, heart malfunction. 

As the name suggests, sudden cardiac death occurs without warning, explains the report in the British Medical Journal.

It is caused by an unexpected loss of heart function, which rapidly reduces blood flow around the body, including to the brain.

The U.S. researchers wanted to find out if those with muffin tops and beer bellies are at greater risk of sudden cardiac death, as the evidence suggests this distribution of body fat may be more dangerous.

The risk was ascertained using the waist to hip ratio - calculated by dividing the waist measurement by the hip measurement.

Studies show people with the highest waist to hip ratio are twice as likely to be affected as those with ratio in the normal range. 

But the researchers wanted to find out if those with muffin tops and beer bellies are at greater risk of sudden cardiac death - as the evidence suggests this distribution of body fat may be more dangerous.

It is thought that carrying fat around the stomach - and therefore vital organs - is more dangerous than carrying it around the hips or thighs.

The scientists, of the Veterans Affairs Medical Center, in Minneapolis, Minnesota, studied almost 15,000 middle-aged men and women aged between 45 and 64.

All the people were taking part in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study, which has been tracking the causes of artery narrowing in middle-aged Americans since 1987.

All the participants underwent a detailed health assessment in 1987-89, and then again in 1990-92, 1993-95, 1996-98 and 2011-13. 

It is thought that carrying fat around the stomach - and therefore vital organs - is more dangerous than carrying it around the hips or thighs.

This included measurements of weight, height, waist circumference and the waist to hip ratio.

During the monitoring period, which averaged 12.5 years, sudden cardiac deaths occurred.

On average, those affected were in their mid-50s, two-thirds of victims were men and 40 per cent were of African American heritage.

Unsurprisingly, those who died suddenly tended to have more known risk factors for heart disease, such as high blood pressure and high cholesterol.

They also had a higher BMI (Body Mass Index), larger waist circumference and a larger waist to hip ratio - an indicator of central obesity - than those who were not affected.

The risk of sudden cardiac death was associated with general obesity, but only in non-smokers. 

And of the measures of obesity - BMI, waist circumference, and waist to hip ratio - the latter was the most strongly linked to sudden cardiac death risk after taking other influential factors into account.

And unlike BMI and waist circumference, the link between waist to hip ratio stood regardless of existing coronary heart disease, diabetes or high blood pressure and other known risk factors.

The researchers stressed the study is an observational one, so no definitive conclusions can be drawn about cause and effect.

They added the precise mechanisms for the association between sudden cardiac death and central obesity are not known.

However it is known that fat around the midriff is thought to be more critical than fat stored elsewhere in the body, because of its influence on inflammation.
