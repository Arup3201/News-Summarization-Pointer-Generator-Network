On this the 150th anniversary of the signing of the Thirteenth Amendment, which abolished slavery, new photos have been released showing some of the men and women who lived through its horrors - and were then granted their freedom.

The portraits were taken in the late 1930s, 70 years after abolition, and focused on a group of 500 individuals.

Along with the photos, each person shared the harrowing experiences they endured as a slave.

According to Mashable, the photos were all taken for the as part of the Federal Writers’ Project (FWP) of the Work Progress Administration (WPA).

The FWP was an initiative started during the Great Depression that had writers across the country take down the stories of American citizens. 

The set was ultimately published in 1941 in and called Slave Narratives: A Folk History of Slavery in the United States from Interviews with Former Slaves.

All total, there were 17 volumes.

The collection contains more than 10,000 typed pages representing more than 2000 interviews.

Historians have however said of the collection that because the stories were collected almost exclusively by white interviewers, it is slightly biased.

The collection also includes tape recordings, which were released in 1998.
