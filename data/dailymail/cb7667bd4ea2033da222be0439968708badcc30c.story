Paula Radcliffe finished third in the Worcester City 10k on Sunday morning in her first competitive outing in over two years.

The women's world marathon record holder clocked a time of 35 minutes 49 seconds in the inaugural event as she builds towards a potential career swansong at next year's London Marathon.

The 40-year-old's last race was a half-marathon in Vienna in April 2012, with foot problems subsequently ruling her out of that year's London Olympics.

Ongoing complications with the same injury led to suggestions Radcliffe might never compete again, but the 40-year-old revealed earlier this year that her dream was to take part in one more London Marathon before calling time on her career.

The world, European and Commonwealth Games gold medallist set her world-record mark of two hours 15 minutes 25 seconds in the 2003 London Marathon.

Radcliffe, despite being 40, hopes to run one more Marathon in London, where she set the world record in 2003
