A natural reaction upon winning the Mega Millions is shock and disbelief - so much so, one lucky lottery winner decided to wait seven weeks before collecting their winnings.

Maryland Lottery officials say the second winner of a $414 million Mega Millions jackpot from March has now come forward.

Officials announced Tuesday that the Maryland resident, who chose to remain anonymous, claimed the prize, quietly, late last week.

A Florida couple came forward to claim their half of the jackpot last week too.  Lottery officials say the winner said, 'You have to play your lucky numbers.'

Lottery officials say the Maryland winner chose the cash option and will receive $76.4 million after taxes.

The state will receive more than $10.1 million in tax revenue and Lady's Liquors in La Plata, the store where the winning ticket was sold, will receive a $100,000 agent bonus.

In Florida, the winning ticket was sold at a Sunoco convenience store on Merritt Island.

The drawing also had eight $1 million winners.

The Maryland winner bought the ticket at Lady's Liquor in La Plata, a town of nearly 9,000 about 30 miles from the nation's capital.

The winner picked the numbers manually, rather than through a machine's random selection, Maryland Lottery Director Stephen Martino said.

The tickets with all five matching numbers, plus the multiplier, are entitled to the jackpot which they can redeem in two ways.

The first is through an annuity program with one immediate payment, following by annual payments for the next 29 years that increase 5 per cent with each payment.

The increased payments were designed to cover the annual increase in cost of living so that winners 'lifestyle and purchasing power' would remain the same through their lifetime.

The other option is to take a one-time lump sum payment. If the ticket holders in Maryland and Florida chose that option, they are entitled to $223 million.

Even if you don't match all six numbers, you can be eligible for prizes up to $1million.

Mega Millions changed its rules in October to help increase jackpots by lowering the odds of winning the top prize

Mega Millions is played in 43 states, the District of Columbia and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
