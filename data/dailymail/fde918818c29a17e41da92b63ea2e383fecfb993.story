Genie’s Army did not march in great numbers, but the heiress apparent to Maria Sharapova as the glamour queen of tennis took a significant step towards the queen of Wimbledon on Tuesday night.

Should Eugenie Bouchard ultimately face Serena Williams in the fourth round, what a royal clash of generations it would be, pitting the 32-year-old winner of five Wimbledon singles titles against a 20-year-old rapidly emerging  as one of the biggest draws in the game.

Both women took positive strides, Williams battering Anna Tatishvili into a one-hour defeat with only three games wasted, while No 13 seed Bouchard won the pick of the first-round ties, scuffling past Daniela Hantuchova 7-5, 7-5.

By the standards of this Canadian — 
like her three siblings she was named after a royal — it was a muted 
performance and a muted occasion. She is more familiar to whoops and 
wolf whistles from crowds, not to mention the shower of stuffed toys 
that tends to accompany her victories.

There are social networks dedicated to planning the movements of ‘Genie’s Army’ around Europe.

Not
 at the All England Club, though. ‘I saw a few single members of Genie 
Army — but it’s Wimbledon, so we’re a little bit more subdued here,’ she
 said last night, cradling a stuffed Cinderella. ‘Because I’m a 
princess,’ she explained. But generally the mood was heavier.

The
 woman with a soft touch and a hard streak — she has an on-court glare 
and fist-pump not dissimilar to Sharapova’s — was far from her best 
against a strong opponent. Hantuchova has fallen to No 35 in the world, 
but she has been as high as No 5 and last year reached the 
quarter-finals of the US Open.

The
 Slovakian broke Bouchard three times and, indeed, led by a break in 
each set. With a more dependable second serve,  Hantuchova would have 
had a reasonable chance.

Bouchard,
 who won junior Wimbledon on this court two years ago and has this year 
reached the semi-finals of the Australian and French Opens, added: ‘I 
definitely feel like I didn’t play my best most of the match, but I 
raised my  level at some big points... at 5-5 in both sets.

‘I
 felt like I was a bit inconsistent. The first match of a tournament, 
especially a Grand Slam,  is always a bit nervy. I think  there was a 
bit of nervous tennis out there.’
