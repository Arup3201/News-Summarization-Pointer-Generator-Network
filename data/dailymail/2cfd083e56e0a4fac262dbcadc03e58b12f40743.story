As Casey Anthony looks forward to being released from jail today, shocking letters reveal that the 25-year-old has plans to have more children.

In jailhouse letters, Anthony told how she has dreamt of being pregnant again and is considering adopting as there are 'so many children that deserve to be loved'.

The Orlando woman, who was stunningly acquitted of the murder of her two-year-old daughter Caylee, has plans to write a book, which she describes a memoir and relationship advice book.

Shocking letters: Casey Anthony revealed that she wants to be a mother again in jailhouse correspondence

The prisoner, who has spent nearly three years inside, also revealed how she is looking forward to having her teeth whitened, being able to wear sexy underwear and becoming 'a part of society' again after her release.

Last night Jose Baez gave his first interview since the Casey Anthony verdict.

Speaking to Barbara Walters, Mr Baez called Casey an 'extremely intelligent, kind warm hearted individual.'

He recounted how 'The happiest moment came after the first not guilty verdict - I knew I had saved her life.'

When asked whether Casey was a good mother, Mr Baez became cagey, adding: 'I think that came out in the trial'.

Confident in his case Mr Baez said: 'This was not a murder case, it never was.'

Continuing to defend Casey he spoke of how the media and spectators had vilified his client.

He said: 'They think she is a monster they think she is a cold hearted killer - nothing can be further from the truth.'

But he went on to admit Casey was, 'someone with serious issues.'

He concluded by excusing Casey's bizarreÂ  behaviour, pointing to her past.

He said: 'When you look at the life she had before this ever happened...within her family and within her self,' that it was no wonder how she turned out.

Anthony will today be sentence by Judge Belvin Perry for the four minor counts of lying to law enforcement, which were the only charges on which the jury found her guilty.

She is expected to walk free from the hearing as the maximum penalty she faces is four years in prison, and she has already served nearly three.

On release, she will have no restrictions stopping her from capitalising on the case by signing movie or book deals or selling interviews.

'I had a dream not too long ago that I was pregnant,' wrote Anthony in one of more than 50 letters sent to fellow inmate Robyn Adams, which have been released.

'It was like having Cays all over again,' she wrote, referring to daughter Caylee. 'I've thought about adopting, which even sounds weird to me saying it, but there are so many children that deserve to be loved.'

In another letter to her fellow 
inmate in the Orlando County Jail, she wrote: 'Let's make a deal? Let's 
get pregnant together? If it's really possible to plan it.'

The
handwritten letters, which were written between 2008 and 2009, give a 
fascinating insight into what Anthony will do on release from prison.

In
one letter Anthony told how she has plans to write what she describes 
as a 'partial memoir/comedy/relationship advice book for those not in 
the know'.

Getting ready for release: Casey Anthony could be freed from jail tomorrow morning at her sentencing

'It's a way to settle many rumors and to share my insight about love, life and most important - God,' she added. 'Who knows.'

The 25-year-old also made references to starting a business. She wrote: 'When are we going to sit on the beach, drinking cocktails and planning our future business?'

Perhaps surprisingly, the prisoner also wrote that she wants to give money to charity.

Sentencing: Judge Belvin Perry could decide to release Casey Anthony at the hearing in Orlando tomorrow at 9am

Dead: Anthony wrote that she had a dream in which she was pregnant. She said it felt like when she had Caylee

'I want to donate money to charities? Leukemia [sic] research, breast cancer, cervical cancer,' she wrote.

The letters give extensive detail of what Anthony misses the most about life outside prison and what she is looking forward to doing on release.

'I can't wait to get my teeth whitened and to use my regular toothbrush/toothpaste/shampoo, conditioner,' she wrote.

'I still have no desire to wear heels unless the occasion calls for it. But Converse, boots and REAL flipflops? Ah! And hats, regular ball caps.'

'Sunglasses. Underwear, that fits!' she added to the list. 'Is that vain? Should I not look forward to these things?'

Anthony also wrote how she is looking forward to being able to treat herself to manicures and pedicures on trips to the beauty salon.

'Color on my toesies and acrylic nails - yes please,' she wrote. 'I want to embrace the many joys of being a lady.'

'And girl, I could use a day at Target myself,' she continued. 'Just to walk around the store, to be a part of society. I want to go grocery shopping.'

The jury's decision led to outrage across America, leading to fears for her safety when she is released from prison.

But the letter reveal that Anthony has already been thinking about creating a new identity.

'If you could change your name to any name, what would it be?' she wrote in one letter. 'I've been thinking about that a lot lately."

'Ideas? Many ideas.'
