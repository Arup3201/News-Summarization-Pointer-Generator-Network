Just 19 months ago, Nathan Matthews posed happily with his teenage stepsister Becky Watts as their parents married.

His girlfriend, Shauna Hoare, also smiled as she stood alongside the teenager and the delighted newlyweds.

Yesterday, Matthews and Hoare stood emotionless in the dock to face charges after 16-year-old Becky’s dismembered body was discovered 80 yards from their home earlier this week.

Delivery driver Matthews, 28, is accused of murdering his stepsister. Hoare, 21, is accused of ‘consistently lying to police’ in an attempt to protect her boyfriend.

A photograph from Darren and Anjie Galsworthy's 2013 wedding has emerged showing Matthews (far left) next to the couple, with Hoare (next to Mrs Galsworthy) and Becky (right) as bridesmaids

Nathan Matthews, the stepbrother of Becky Watts, was remanded in custody this morning after he appeared in court charged with the 16-year-old's murder. He is pictured in a court sketch of the short hearing

Matthews's girlfriend, Shauna Hoare, 21, also pictured in a sketch by a court artist, appeared in a separate hearing in the same packed courtroom charged with attempting to pervert the course of justice

Their separate court appearances were a stark contrast to the wedding photograph which was taken by a family friend in August 2013, after Becky’s father Darren Galsworthy, 51, married Matthews’ mother Anjie, 49, at a church ceremony in St George, Bristol.

Nearly 100 guests attended a reception at the nearby Bendix Club, Kingswood, where Becky and her stepbrother were seen laughing and joking together. Matthews, who held his and Hoare’s young daughter in the picture, was dressed in the same grey suit and cream waistcoat as his stepfather.

Hoare and Becky wore matching blue bridesmaid dresses.

At Bristol Magistrates’ Court yesterday, the accused were both dressed in baggy blue t-shirts as they were led into the dock handcuffed to a guard. Matthews spoke only to give his name and address during his short appearance, before being remanded to appear via video link in the city’s crown court today.

Becky, 16, was last seen at her home in the St George's area of Bristol on February 19. Body parts thought to belong to the teenager were found on Monday night after police were called to an address in Barton Hill

Minutes later, his girlfriend appeared in court, holding her arm across her stomach as she listened to the charge against her.

It read: ‘Between February 18 and March 1 you did a series of acts which had the tendency to pervert the course of public justice, in that you hindered the police investigation to assist Nathan Matthews and intended for him to avoid detection for the murder of Rebecca Watts.’

District Judge Lynne Matthews remanded her to appear in court next month. A small group gathered outside screamed abuse and hit the side of the custody van as the defendants were driven away.

Matthews, seen in another court sketch, was handcuffed to a female dock officer as he appeared in court

Hoare, also seen in a court sketch, wore a dark coloured short-sleeved T shirt and had shoulder-length brown hair, which appeared unwashed

No details of the case were given as Matthews stood handcuffed to a dock officer before being led away

Hoare, who lives in the Barton Hill area of Bristol, was remanded in custody to appear at Bristol Crown Court for a preliminary hearing on April 2

Mr and Mrs Galsworthy, who made televised TV appeals together after Becky went missing, were not at the hearing yesterday.

Becky vanished from her home in Bristol on the morning of February 19. Police launched a huge search operation after she was reported missing the following afternoon.

But on Monday night, detectives discovered her ‘cut up’ body at a house in Barton Hill, Bristol.

A further four men and a woman are still being quizzed by police after being arrested on suspicion of assisting Becky’s killer following the discovery of her body.

Police were yesterday granted a further 24 hours to interview them.

The van believed to be carrying Nathan Matthews leaves Bristol Magistrates' Court after the short hearing

As a white custody van left the court shortly before 11am, members of the public who had been waiting outside the court banged on the sides of the vehicle and yelled abuse as it drove away

Linda Dobson (pictured), who had been outside court with her husband, said of Becky: 'She was a young girl with so much to live for'

A marked police van shielded by four uniformed officers on foot is thought to have taken Matthews and Hoare into the back of the court

Photographers await the arrival of the police van thought to contain Matthews and Hoare

A forensic officer makes their way past a sea of flowers left outside Becky's home today as police continue to search the property

The bank of floral tributes and soft toys left in memory of the 16-year-old by her friends and neighbours

Many of the floral tributes carried photographs of Becky and messages offering support to her family

This toy was one of dozens left in memory of the student as the community attempts to deal with the loss

 

Members of Becky's family visited her home yesterday, where they too left flowers and read messages of remembrance and support from members of the public

Becky's uncle Sam Galsworthy, seen hugging a family member as he looks at the tributes to his niece, said Becky 'will live on in the hearts of all of us'
