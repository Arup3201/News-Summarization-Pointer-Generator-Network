Silent partner: Eighteen months after receiving a cash injection from celebrity investor Stephen Fry, social platform Pushnote has closed

Web comment service Pushnote has closed less than 18 months after receiving a cash injection, and a lot of publicity, from celebrity investor Stephen Fry.

The 54-year-old actor and comedian informed his millions of Twitter followers in January last year that he was putting his money into the technology start-up.

Pushnote was a browser add-on tool that let people post comments on websites using only one button.

Mr Fry, well known for his love of 
technology, said at the time: 'I'm very pleased to be in the background 
as a silent but enthusiastic member of the Pushnote team.

'It’s one of those little ideas that I
think will grow and grow. It will soon, I think, become second nature 
for those browsing the web to look up to the Pushnote icon and check 
what fellow "Pushnoters" have said about the site they're on, its 
content, its value, reliability and so on.'

He also promoted Pushnote by telling 
his Twitter followers: 'You might like to try my new baby. Hope you like
it. Makes the web one big democratic comment platform.'

But the concept did not take off and today the company's website displayed a farewell notice.

It read: 'We're very sorry, but Pushnote has been taken down.

'It was a difficult decision, not 
least because we loved the great content shared on Pushnote, and we’re 
sorry we can no longer support the site.

'As an innovative social platform, 
Pushnote was always a bit of an experiment. It was a lot of fun and we 
made a lot of friends, but our passions have led us elsewhere.

'The people behind Pushnote have been 
dreaming up new ideas for some time, and those ideas have come to 
eclipse Pushnote, so it’s time to move on.

'It's a wonderfully innovative time for the web and we hope you're enjoying it as much as we are.'

The amount of money Mr Fry invested and the share of the company he owned is unknown.

But technology reporter Andrew 
Orlowski wrote on The Register:  'You can't say much worse about a 
social media offering than this - it was such a turkey that not even 
Stephen Fry could make it popular.'
