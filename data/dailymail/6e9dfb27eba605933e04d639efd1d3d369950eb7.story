Whether clubs are primed to contest the title race, battle over European places or fight tooth and nail to avoid the drop, the winter transfer window is their chance to shuffle the squad.

Clubs notoriously play it rather cagey in the early part of the window. But as soon as a couple of big deals happen later in the window, it often sparks a mad scramble as clubs look to bolster their squads at knockdown prices.

Of course, January is also a time out-of-favour players agitate for a move away - especially in a World Cup year - or clubs look to ditch high earners.

So, keep track of all the latest transfers this month with our club-by-club guide...
