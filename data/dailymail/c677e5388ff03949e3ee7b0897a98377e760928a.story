An Alzheimer's sufferer hoping to visit Gallipoli to honour his late war veteran father has been told he will be stripped of his disability pension if he travels to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the ANZAC landings. 

Pat Nichols was ecstatic when his name was pulled out of a ballot to go to Turkey  but his elation was short-lived once he discovered he wouldn't receive his disability pension throughout the six-week trip.

The devastating news came as the Federal Government changed the laws on January 1 to prevent disability pensioners to receive the allowance while living overseas.

Pat Nichols won a chance to visit Gallipoli to pay tribute to his late war veteran father but he will be stripped of his disability pension if he takes the trip to fulfill his lifelong dream under new government laws

Pat couldn't believe that taking the holiday would be determined as living overseas.

'This is just ridiculous when you can't spend - even if it is six weeks of time- just to honour your father,' he told A Current Affair. 

Samuel Nichols, who died 53 years ago when Pat was a young boy, fought in both World War I and II, and his son has always wanted to pay his respects to his father.

'Our fathers fought for freedom - this is not freedom - this is picking on the vulnerable people,' he said. 

Although Pat and his wife, June, have been saving for years for the trip in April - if they don't received the pension while they are away - it will break the bank.

The couple can apply for an exemption but there is no guarantee it will be granted.

Federal Disability Services Minister, Scott Morrison, said the department has offered the couple assistance with that application and process. 

'There are some clear rules here that have to be followed - you have to have one rule for everyone if you're going to have a system that's fair,' he said.

'When you have a generous system of supporting people with disabilities you need to have strong rules to ensure that it's always protected.'

Pat  is suffering from Alzheimer's therefore it is likely to be his last chance to honour his father at Gallipoli

Pat and his wife, June, are still determined to go on the trip despite the financial hardship they will face

Pat was  forced to retire as a factory worker in May last year and he has had a slow and steady decline but receiving the heartbreaking news has made his condition worse. 

June said time was running out for the couple as her husband's memory deteriorated. 

'Life was going along pretty sweet for us and then he was diagnosed and suddenly all of the plans and dreams and hopes you had for the future - you know that they are all gone,' she said.

Despite the financial blow, the couple are determined to still go on the trip as doctors said it is likely to be Pat's last chance to honour his dad. 

'I was lucky my father came home but to be able to got to Gallipoli and honour him and go to some of the countries that he fought in during that war is just my last dream,' Pat said.

'Gallipoli means everything to me at the moment because it might be my last chance to get to Gallipoli on the 100th anniversary where all of those Australian soldiers fought and died. 

'It's what it means to people not because you just want to save a dollar - this is not what Australia is all about.'

Federal Disability Services Minister, Scott Morrison, said the disability pension system had to be fair
