A Missouri family is speaking out about being forced to spend all their savings to fix a new home that partiers broke into and trashed just hours after they closed on the place.

The Kaiser family was horrified when they got to their new home to find it covered in urine, vomit, and cigarette burns.

And their discoveries only got worse. The Kaisers would soon find damages to the house they'd bought move-in ready that amounted to $30,000.

Trashed: A Missouri couple's new home was completely trashed by partiers who broke in just hours after they closed on the place

Filthy: The four bedroom home was ready for Curtis Kaiser and his family to move in when they bought it but the next time the showed up, there were cigarette burns in every floor, holes in the wall and filth everywhere

Ruined: Floors were ruined throughout the home and the Kaisers, who'd only just bought the place, started draining their savings and putting materials on credit cards to fix the place back up

That's without labor costs. Curtis Kaiser, a home contractor, told KTVI that he's done all the work himself.

'They urinated in cabinets,' revealed Kaiser. 'There’s cigarette burns all over all the floors, the carpets, the laminates, I mean there was alcohol spilled everywhere, there was vomit all over the place, and they broke the handrails up the stairs.'

The Kaisers hauled three Dumpsters worth of cast off booze bottles and other filth from the home.

Because the Affton home was outfitted with custom windows and kitchen cabinets, the Kaisers had to replace every cabinet and window--even the non-damaged ones.

But the costly damage didn't end there. The partiers did damage to the actual structure of the home, as well.

Pricey: Homeowner Curtis Kaiser happens to be a contractor and the family spent around $30,000 on materials alone as he did all the construction work himself

Custom job: Because the windows were custom made for the home, Kaiser had to replace all of them, not just the damaged ones

'I guess a whole bunch of people got out there, and it caved in, and so we had to replace the flat part of the roof, too,'

'It’s been close to $30,000, probably, and that’s just materials and buying stuff, and that’s just with me doing all the work,' he told KTVI.

Adding insult to injury, one girl from the party even returned to the home to get something she'd left.

'Some girl showed up in our driveway wanting to get her beer pong table back from the party,' recalled a very annoyed Kaiser.

The St. Louis County police say they're actively investigating the incident and that they have several persons of interest.

Insult to injury: One partygoer even returned to the home and asked Kaiser for her beer pong table back

The Kaisers hauled three Dumpsters full of trash out of the home that was left by partygoers

While authorities have released no names of suspects, the Kaisers--who say they've seen photos of and conversations about the party on Facebook--believe a former occupant of the home has something to do with it.

The timing of the break-in, right after the Kaisers closed, appears to support that hunch.

If found, police could charge suspects with trespassing and burglary, though that won't help the Kaisers get back their savings or pay down credit cards.

To receive any financial restitution, the family will have to file a civil lawsuit.
