Former Missouri Republican congressman Todd Akin made the claim that some people working on his campaign team had been conceived by rape as he once again attempted to justify his controversial remarks about 'legitimate rape' on MSNBC on Thursday.

During the 2012 U.S. Senate campaign Akin’s controversial rape comments caused a national outrage, which lost him the support of senior Republicans and ultimately cost him his seat.

In his new book, Firing Back: Taking On The Party Bosses And Media Elite To Protect Our Faith And Freedom., Akin attempts to set the record straight and also writes that he regrets ever apologizing in a television commercial.

Speaking on MSNBC’s The Daily Rundown to promote his book on Thursday, Akin admitted he had used a poor choice of words in 2012, but stood by his argument that ‘legitimate rape’ rarely caused pregnancy and said he had worked with people who were conceived by rape.

‘I had number of people on my campaign that were children that were conceived in rape - helping me on the campaign,’ he said.

'I believe that little children are special,' he also told host Chuck Todd.

It was during an interview with a local TV reporter in 2012, that Akin asserted that rape victims are less likely to get pregnant because ‘the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down.’

In his new political memoir Akin writes that his wife Lulli was the only person in his team who objected to him filming an apology ad over his rape comments

The 67-year-old Akin, who spent 12 years in Congress and another dozen as a state lawmaker, lost to Democrat Claire McCaskill.

In a new political memoir Akin writes that his remarks on whether abortion should be legal in cases of rape were taken out of context and led to his 'political assassination' and betrayal by GOP allies.

The 209-page book includes a foreword by former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, who, like Akin, criticizes Republican leaders for abandoning the candidate soon after his remarks garnered national attention and almost immediately dominated the campaign.

Some blamed Akin - who resisted calls to drop out of the race - for costing Republicans a chance to gain a majority in the Senate.

Akin writes he believes stress can affect a woman's ability to conceive, expanding on his earlier thoughts on the subject.

'My comment about a woman's body shutting the pregnancy down was directed to the impact of stress on fertilization,' he writes.

'This is something fertility doctors debate and discuss. Doubt me? Google 'stress and infertility,' and you will find a library of research on the subject.'

'The research is not conclusive, but there is considerable evidence that stress makes conception more difficult,' he adds. 'And what could be more stressful than a rape?'

Akin also says he only agreed to film a campaign ad in which he apologized for those comments because he was under pressure from his political advisers and campaign staff.

He now regrets that apology and says he should have listened to his wife Lulli, the only person who objected.

'By asking the public at large for forgiveness, I was validating the willful misrepresentation of what I had said,' he writes in a chapter entitled Damage Control.
