AT&T is in talks to swallow up DirectTV in a deal that could be worth close to $50billion, sources have revealed.

The telecoms giant is said to be discussing an offer in the low- to mid-$90s per share for DirectTV, a satellite TV provider, which closed trading at $87.16 yesterday.

A bid near $95 per share would value DirecTV at more than $48billion - a premium of more than 20 percent to its stock price before news of AT&T's interest first emerged on May 1.

The talks are the latest sign of a rising tide of potential megadeals in the telecoms, cable and satellite TV space, including Comcast's proposed $45billion takeover of Time Warner Cable.

A tie-up between AT&T and DirectTV firm would create a pay TV behemoth close in size to a combined Comcast and Time Warner, which means the proposed merger could run into trouble with competition regulators.

The consolidations come as television and other media industries face an uncertain future. Web-based TV and mobile internet are changing the way audiences consume products and slashing advertising revenue.

AT&T, based in Dallas, Texas, is the second-largest provider of mobile communications and the largest provider of fixed telephone lines in the U.S. It is the the 20th-largest mobile telecom operator in the world, with over 250 million mobile customers.

Its takeover target DirectTV broadcasts by satellite to nearly 20million U.S. customers and a nearly 10million across Latin America.

A deal price has yet to be finalised and terms could still change, two sources told Reuters, adding that discussions are continuing. They asked not to be named because the matter is not public.

Other details also have yet to be worked out, such as a break-up fee as well as a potential role for DirecTV Chief Executive Officer Mike White, the second person said.

AT&T and DirecTV declined to comment. Bloomberg News earlier reported that AT&T was offering to pay around $100 per share for DirecTV, whose management team will continue to run the company as a unit of AT&T.

The Wall Street Journal said a deal could happen in two weeks. DirecTV shares rose 6 per cent to $92.50 in extended trading on Monday.

DirecTV is working with advisers including Goldman Sachs to evaluate a possible combination following a recent takeover approach from AT&T, Reuters reported last week.

ReconAnalytics analyst Roger Entner said the time appeared to be right for an AT&T-DirectTV tie up, which could help both firms navigate the increasingly uncertain media landscape.

'This is not the first time that AT&T and DirecTV have danced around the fire and thought if they could give it a go,' he said.

'They both looked at each other for at least 10 years. Both kind of came to the conclusion that it was in the right environment. It makes a lot of sense to get together, but there was never the right regulatory environment for it.'

A Comcast-Time Warner Cable merger would call for a counterweight like a combined AT&T-DirecTV, said Mr Entner. He added that the merger would make sense for DirecTV given the decline of satellite TV.

'They both see the Grim Reaper at the horizon. DirecTV hasn't gone out and bought spectrum. Dish has, so DirecTV needs to find a partner, and AT&T is that partner.'

Some investors have also speculated about a potential tie-up of DirectTV and smaller rival Dish Network Corp.

Dish Chairman Charlie Egan last week said his company, which attempted to buy DirecTV more than a decade ago, would not make a fresh approach at current prices even though he said such a tie-up would create many benefits.
