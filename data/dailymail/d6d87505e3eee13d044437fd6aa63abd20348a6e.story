A remarkable letter written by the future Edward VIII that exposes him as an ungrateful, sexist and racist prince has come to light.

The Prince of Wales, who later abdicated to marry an American divorcee, told of the ‘miserable and loathsome’ time he was having on a Caribbean cruise.

He visited Barbados in 1920 in what was supposed to be a diplomatic trip of the British Empire but he described the tropical paradise as a ‘bum place’.

The future Edward VIII visited Barbados in 1920 on what was supposed to be a diplomatic trip however he revealed he found it 'deadly dull' in a letter to his mistress

The Royal reported the local scenery as being ‘ugly’ and he found the ‘coloured population’ to be ‘revolting’.

He also wrote of begrudgingly dancing with various women on the trip, all of whom he insisted had to be young and vetted by his friend, Louis Mountbatten.

Edward, whose name before he was King was David, even described one young lady he danced with as an ‘American bit’.

Edward VIII wrote this sickeningly-sweet love letter to his then mistress, Freda Dudley Ward, while he was on a diplomatic trip to Barbados in 1920

The diatribe on the trip was included in a sickeningly-sweet love letter to his then mistress, Freda Dudley Ward, in which he bleated about how much he was missing her.

The married socialite was the future King’s lover between 1918 to 1923.

They remained close until 1936 when he met American divorcee Wallis Simpson, who he gave up the throne for later that year.

Over 22 pages, Edward wrote of his travels on HMS Renown from March 21 to March 29, 1920.

'How I loathe being separated from  you like this and it all seems so unnatural sweetie mine; how I want you tonight to tell you how madly I love you. Oh! My darling darling precious beloved little Fredie life is absolute hell for your little David. Without you I'm oh so miserable. I just don't feel I can live these seven months of this sordid lonely existence without my Fredie.'

'I can't or shan't be able to raise the least enthusiasm about anything [on] this trip; it all seems to me so terribly artificial and organised somehow tho [sic].'

'We are all depressed tonight as we lost a man overboard this afternoon. 'He was apparently leaning against the rails on the side of the ship [...] and fell overboard [...] we never saw him again. Of course one man's death means nothing sweetheart only it's a depressing effect on everybody!!'

'I only danced three dances towards the end and never loathed anything so much beloved one; but I just had to tho [sic]. I've appointed Dickie my 'procurer' of partners and only take on a 'young woman' that he has vetted as being possible!! But Christ! They were the absolute limit tonight as I can't remember what the three women I danced with look like as I hardly looked at them.'

'There are over 170,000 of them the white population is very small and they aren't much to look at all too deadly dull and of course depressingly primitive.'

In the gushing letter, he wrote of how much he missed his mistress, telling her ‘how I want you tonight to tell you and show you how madly I love you.’

He added: 'Oh! My darling darling precious beloved little Freddie, life is absolute hell & torture for your little David without YOU.'

The Prince of Wales then went on to document his hatred of the trip each day which came at a time when Britain was heading into an economic depression after the First World War.

He moaned: 'I can’t and shan’t be able to raise the least enthusiasm about anything on this trip.'It looks a proper bum island this Barbados. It’s a unique sort of scenery very ugly and I don’t take much to the coloured population who are revolting.

'I’m sorry for the colonial office people who have to live there tho (sic).'

The 25-year-old Prince then bleated about have to dance with different women at formal functions.

Edward VIII describes in a letter to his mistress Freda Dudley Ward how he 'vetted' the women he danced with in Barbados

He said: 'Never have I felt less like all that or setting eyes on any woman but you darling angel; the idea absolutely revolts me.

'We gave an official dinner to 20 notables of the island including the governor and his wife which was followed by a reception.

'I’ve appointed Dickie [Mountbatten] my 'procurer' of partners and only take on a 'young woman' that he has vetted as being possible!!

Edward VIII explains in a letter from a trip to Barbados in 1920 how losing a man overboard had a 'depressing effect on everybody'

'But Christ! They were the absolute limit tonight and I can’t remember what the three women I danced with look like as I hardly looked at them!!

'I danced quite a lot sweetheart: Dickie found me a little American bit who wasn’t such a bad mover but the rest of the women were impossible.'

The letter is now being sold by a private collector at auction with a pre-sale estimate of £1,200.Richard Davie, of International Autograph Auctions, said: 'This is a letter of quite remarkable content that reflects Edward VIII’s character.

'He was one of the most colourful members of the Royal family who showed his emotions.

Edward VIII described the locals as 'deadly dull and of course depressingly primitive' on what was supposed to be a diplomatic trip to Barbados in 1920

'I’m sure in March 1920 many British people would have gladly swapped places with him in Barbados and the Caribbean.

'He was in a very fortunate position but the tone of this letter written over the course of a week is one of ungratefulness.

'After he abdicated, Edward went on to become the governor of the Bahamas. Hopefully his attitude had changed by then and he was more diplomatic.'

The letter is being sold at the Edwardian Radisson Hotel at Heathrow, London, on Saturday.
