Loadsamoney: This bank vault carpeted with £270,000-worth of Swiss five centime coins is up for sale

Mobile: The safe is in Basel, Switzerland, but the sellers say it can be transported anywhere in the world

Activism: The vault is being sold by a group campaigning for a basic monthly 
income for each Swiss citizen

It was built in 1912 and features 1619 deposit boxes with all keys available. The boxes and lockers were handmade from steel and brass.

The vault is being sold by the Generation Basic Income Initiative, who campaign for a basic income for each Swiss citizen on a monthly basis.

In October they placed eight million five-centime pieces into the bank vault, one for each citizen in Switzerland before dumping the 15 tons of money in front of the parliament building in Bern.

Now the vault and its contents are up for sale with the price negotiable on application.

Fully kitted out:  The vault was built in 1912 for the Schweizer Volksbank and features 1619 deposit boxes with all keys available. The boxes and lockers were handmade from steel and brass

Empty: The vault before it was filled with cash for the campaigners stunt last month

Spokesman Che Wagner says: 'It is the original bank safe from the former Schweizer Volksbank and known to be one of the finest Swiss piece of craftwork in the early 20th Century.

'It is in very good shape and still usable as a bank deposit safe. It will be removed from its original location and be replaced anywhere in the world. You'll freely decide what happens with it.

'This is not just an investment in a historical, exclusive and certainly unique object but also an investment in a global cultural impulse.'

The Generation Basic Income Initiative
 aims for the government to give a minimum monthly disposal household 
income of CHF 2,500 (£1,690; $2,700) to every citizen living in 
Switzerland.

As well as 
dumping the cash in front of the Swiss parliament last month, the group 
also presented MPs with a 130,000-signature petition urging them to 
introduce the radical measure.

The Swiss Parliament must address or hold a referendum over any issue which has gathered more than 100,000 signatures.

Activists hope the sale of the vault will help them to raise the funds to take their campaign worldwide.

Mr Wager explained: 'The budget of our Generation Basic Income global cultural campaign is estimated at €10m; the amount we'll need to move on with our work to promote the idea of the basic income worldwide and especially in Switzerland, where within three years a national vote is held about the issue.

'This amount will set free possibilities of performances like the one with the coins on the national Square in Bern.'
