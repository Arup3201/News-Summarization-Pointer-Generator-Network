The terrorist group Islamic State's iconic flag featuring the Shahada has been auctioned off to the public at a Liverpool mosque in Western Sydney.

The flag, like the one used by terrorists in footage of the executions of western journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff's, was auctioned for over $2000.

The disturbing footage emerged late on Sunday night featuring a room full of people bidding for items to raise money for the mosque.

Since then the video of the auction has been shared on social media and images of a teenager standing in front of the flag have been posted on Instagram.

The teenage Muslim boy wears all black and and a headscarf around his face. The photograph is captioned with a chilling message 'going to kill Bashar al Assad now'.

Political leaders have spoken out in outrage over the auction of the flag at  Liverpool’s Markaz Imam Ahmad mosque and youth centre.

Premier Mike Baird told the Daily Telegraph that the government would not tolerate any action that gave comfort to terrorists.

'I note Islamic State is listed by the Commonwealth government as a terrorist organisation and that it is against the law to provide it with any support,' he said.

'We expect everyone in New South Wales to obey the law or face the consequences. All parents and all communities need to protect young people from the insidious and corrosive effects of the radical ideologies that are causing so much suffering around the world.'

Unfortunately New South Wales Police are unable to do anything about it as the objective of the auction was stated to raise money for the mosque.

If the money was being used to fund a terrorist group it would only then constitute as a crime.

A new push for a change in laws may be on its way making it illegal to promote and incite terrorism.
