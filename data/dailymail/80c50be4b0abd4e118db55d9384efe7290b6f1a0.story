According to the Telegraph,  cafe owner Zeynep Zabinoglu was one of the last to see Ms Alavi alive on Saturday.

'We both got here at 8am and parked our cars.. I said good morning to her and she said good morning and then we both went to work,' she said.

'Then about an hour and a half later I heard the other girls who work there screaming. I called the police and told them to get here as fast as they can.

'It was too late,' she said.

Mr Zabinoglu, who is a local barista in the area told 9News: 'It's such a shame. You can tell she wouldn't hurt a soul in her life. If you need anything she'll make sure she's there for you.

'It's really, really upsetting to lose somebody like that - a young person, such a young soul.'
