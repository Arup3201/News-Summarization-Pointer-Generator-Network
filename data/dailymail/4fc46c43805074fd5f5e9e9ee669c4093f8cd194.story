Ajax manager Frank de Boer has revealed he has aspirations to one day manage Tottenham or Liverpool after previously going close to taking up the reins at White Hart Lane and Anfield.

De Boer, who has won four Dutch titles at Ajax, has been linked with a move to the Barclays Premier League on multiple occasions and the 44-year-old has now confirmed rumours linking him with a move to England.

The former Dutch international has admitted he was in the running to replace Tim Sherwood at White Hart Lane in the summer, while he was previously approached by Liverpool.

Mauricio Pochettino beat off competition from De Boer to take up the reins at White Hart Lane 

Speaking exclusively to FourFourTwo, De Boer said: 'Together with Mauricio Pochettino I was the biggest candidate, and if they had chosen me, I would've done it.

"If I get an offer from a club in the future, I will consider the possibility and then follow my feeling. I look at whether it's a club where I think I can present myself well and where I'll be able to act in the way I like.

'Before, there was potential interest from Monaco as well, but it wasn't something I was looking for at that moment. Liverpool and Spurs are clubs I could manage.

'Liverpool approached me in the same way Tottenham did this year, wanting to hold exploratory talks first.'

De Boer is keen on following fellow countryman Louis van Gaal and Ronald Koeman to England
