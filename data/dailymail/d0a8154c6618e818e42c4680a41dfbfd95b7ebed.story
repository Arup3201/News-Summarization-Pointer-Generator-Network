Cabinet Office Minister Francis Maude revealed that the Government has achieved savings of £10 billion over the past financial year

Civil servants waste three days a year waiting for their computers to turn on, it emerged today.

As minister trumpeted saving £10billion in the last year by changing the way Whitehall works, officials admitted slow IT systems had cost the taxpayer time and money.

Senior advisers said the government has been paying 'top dollar' for services but has not been getting the best service.

Stephen Kelly, the Government's new chief operating officer, said: 'I came into the office and I pressed my PC and it took me seven minutes to boot up.

'That's government in the old world, that's three days of the year I waste of my time booting up,' the Standard reported.

'I think the average cost of a desktop [computer] a year is about £6,000. You could go and buy 10 iPads a year.'

His comments came as Cabinet Office Minister Francis Maude boasted that the government has secured savings of £10 billion over the past financial year, a 25 per cent increase on their target.

He said the Cabinet Office was charged £57 for a PC power cable which is on Amazon for £20 and can be bought wholesale for £8.

According to Government figures, the savings are equivalent to nearly £600 per working household in the UK.

The Efficiency and Reform Group, run by the Cabinet Office and the Treasury, said it has effected the savings by cutting civil service costs.

Measures include reducing the size of the civil service and reshaping civil service pensions, the centralisation of the procurement of good and services, improving online services, raising money from the sale of empty buildings and reviewing large-scale projects like construction.

The Government had set itself a £8 billion savings target after the last general election.

Mr Maude said: 'This Government is taking radical decisions to make Whitehall leaner and more efficient so Britain can compete in the global race.

'Civil servants across Government are changing the ways they work and we are on the way to managing our finances like the best-run FTSE100 businesses.

'I'm pleased to announce that this work has saved £10 billion, the equivalent of almost £600 for each hard-working family. These are popular savings which support Britain's deficit reduction and encourage growth.

'In the first year of this Government we saved £3.75 billion compared with the year before the last General Election. In 2011/12 we managed £5.5 billion. The unprecedented £10 billion savings last year shows we have defied expectations and accelerated the pace of reform.

'There can be no going back to the old, wasteful ways of doing things which we saw in the past.

'We know there's a long way still to go to achieve our ambitious plans for savings over the next few years. Hard-working taxpayers rightly expect their money to be spent judiciously.

'The Efficiency and Reform Group are the taxpayers' champions in Whitehall.

Cash to splash: The £10bn of savings are equivalent of nearly £600 for every hard-working family

'I am determined to push ahead with this savings programme and I would like to thank all the civil servants who have worked to make it happen so far.'

Chief secretary to the treasury Danny Alexander said: 'This is a good result and a testament to the hard work being done by departments into making Government as lean as possible.

'There is a great deal more to do before Government is as efficient as it needs to be - that's why in the spending round we will find another £5 billion of savings as a major contribution to reducing the deficit in 2015/16.

'Cutting waste means taxpayers' money can be focused on building a stronger economy in a fairer society.'
