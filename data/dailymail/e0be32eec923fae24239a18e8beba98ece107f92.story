The fiancée of the doctor being treated for Ebola in a New York hospital has said she and her husband-to-be are 'OK', while she and two friends are set to be released from hospital quarantine.

Morgan Dixon, 30, told a friend that she and Craig Spencer, 33, a doctor who was fighting Ebola in Guinea when he contracted the disease himself, were doing well.

The pair are currently at Bellevue Hospital in Manhattan, where Dr Spencer was rushed into isolation Thursday night after testing positive for the deadly virus.

To be wed: The couple, set to marry next Fall, were both checked in to Bellevue Hospital in Manhattan on Thursday

Couple: Dixon, 30, is a charity worker in New York City, while Dr Spencer works for Doctors Without Borders, and had just finished a stint fighting Ebola in Guinea

Two friends of the couple who went bowling with them in Williamsburg this week have been quarantined with Dixon as a precaution - but are set to be moved from the hospital to their homes later today, the New York Times reported.

There they will still be under quarantine but away from the secure ward where Dr Spencer is being treated. Dixon and Spencer live together on West 147th Street in Harlem. 

A friend of Dixon, whom she spoke to by phone yesterday, said her first reaction to the threat of Ebola entering her life was to be grateful that they were in America, where the best treatment is available.

Shavla Wise, a longtime friend, told the Times: 'She literally was like, "This is amazing, being in a privileged position in a well-resourced country." She was also thinking about the folks over there who he left behind.'

She also revealed that while Dr Spencer was still in Guinea, working for the organization Doctors Without Borders, Dixon had joked about what she might do if her fiancé came back with the disease.

Her worst fears were realized after Dr Spencer returned from Guinea on October 17, where he had been treating Ebola victims for a month.

He came back to their home in Harlem and felt fine for days, before developing fatigue and a fever of 100.3 degrees, prompting him to call for medical help.

In the time between his arrival in the U.S. and being taken to hospital, Dr Spencer went for a three-mile jog, ate at a meatball restaurant in Greenwich Village, rode several subway lines and went bowling in Williamsburg.

Happy couple: Dr Spencer and Miss Dixon met in China while attending Henan University in 2007. The wife-to-be is currently in quarantine as a precaution 

Route: How Dr Craig Spencer traveled Manhattan before his diagnosis

City leaders including New York mayor Bill de Blasio and state governor Andrew Cuomo yesterday reassured New Yorkers that they are not at risk of catching the disease, despite Spencer's travels through the city.

Spencer and Dixon, who met on a language-learning course in China, are due to marry next Fall. Friends described Dr Spencer as a 'goofball', who is nonetheless a gifted medical practitioner with a flair for languages.

Dixon, who works at the HOPE Program, a New York charity, has been described by friends as 'liberal and earthy.'

Her colleagues posted a statement yesterday saying: 'Our thoughts and concerns are with our colleague and her fiancé at this time.

'We have spoken with high-level officials at the New York City Department of Health and have been assured that there is no risk at our workplace.'

Shalva said that even from inside the hospital, Dixon was texting her details of an event they planned to go to tonight so she doesn't miss out.
