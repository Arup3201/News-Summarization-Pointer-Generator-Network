Two female tourists who were kidnapped while canoeing in the Amazon jungle have told how they feared they were about to be shot by their captors moments before their dramatic rescue.

Briton Kathryn Cox, 23, and Australian Fiona Wilde, 32, were snatched at gunpoint by a gang of kidnappers in Ecuador's Cuyabeno nature reserve close to the Colombian border.

The pair were dragged away from the river into the jungle where they were robbed before their kidnappers realised the military was closing in.

The pair were rescued following an operation 
involving more than 100 soldiers, police and park rangers after a farmer heard their cries for help.

Talking on Sky News Ms Wilde 
said: 'We were very scared, but we could often hear the helicopters 
above us and that was very comforting while we were in the jungle.

'When the helicopters got right above us the kidnappers made us hide in the bushes and the kidnappers got scared.

'They were, we think, close to maybe 
killing us. And then for some reason they changed their mind and told us
 to run and we ran out, towards the helicopters yelling, trying to get 
their attention.'

Ecuadorean defence minister Miguel Carvajal said: 'They released them because 
of military and police pressure.

'Around 260 men from the armed forces, 
150 police officers, three helicopters were involved.'

The women were said to be in ‘good condition’ last night despite their terrifying ordeal.

Their nightmare began on Friday afternoon as they travelled towards 
Ecuador’s Cuyabeno National Park with three other foreign tourists and 
two local guides.

The nature reserve – made up of rivers, lagoons and forest covering 
2,000 square miles –  is home to more than 500 different species of 
birds, pink freshwater dolphins, 250 species of fish, including piranha,
 and alligators.

The pair had booked the four to five-day expedition with a local tour 
company after arriving in the Tarapoa region of Sucumbios province, in 
the north-east of Ecuador.

The kidnappers – whom locals say have links to a notorious Colombian 
drug-running gang – robbed the tourists of their cameras and phones 
before taking Miss Cox, from Limpsfield in Surrey, and Australian Miss 
Wilde, 32, at gunpoint and escaping into the forest.

The women were 
abandoned later that evening after their kidnappers realised they were 
being tracked.

The traumatised pair were then forced to spend the night alone before their cries for help were heard by a passing farmer.

A source said that the women were also being tracked by the military 
after one kidnapper used a mobile phone, allowing his whereabouts to be 
traced.

The Foreign Office advises against visiting the area because of the 
risk of organised crime. It also warns that ‘express kidnappings’ – 
where victims are held for a short time as criminals empty their bank 
accounts using their bank cards – are common along the Ecuador-Colombia 
border.

There have reportedly been more than 100 kidnappings in the area over 
the past year and the border is notorious for drugs barons.

Katga Saubert, 43, who owns a tour company called Magic River in the 
same area as the kidnapping, said: ‘It is happening all over Ecuador 
and not just here. It is because of the social problems and the poverty.
 Perhaps there should be better security.’

Locals were also quick to blame a criminal gang called the Black Eagles,
 which is made up of ex-paramilitaries.

Miss Cox’s parents, optometrist 
Neil, who owns his own practice, and radiographer Averin, said they were
 too upset to speak.

However, her brother Andy has told neighbours: 
‘She is doing well. She is okay.’

Neighbours say that Miss Cox decided to go travelling in South America after breaking up with her long-term, live-in boyfriend.

She left her job as a senior assessment manager with NHS watchdog 
Monitor and visited Brazil, before arriving in Ecuador this month.

Last night Jose Serrano, Ecuador’s interior minister, said the women 
were ‘in good condition’ and had been flown to a hospital in the capital
 Quito to be examined. His department posted a photograph of the pair on
 Twitter last night, dressed in army fatigues.

Relations between the UK and Ecuador have been strained in recent months
 by the country’s decision to grant asylum to WikiLeaks founder Julian 
Assange.

The 41-year-old, who is currently holed up in London’s Ecuadorian 
Embassy, is wanted by Swedish police for questioning in relation to 
rape and sexual assault allegations. He denies the claims.

A Foreign Office spokesman said: ‘We are pleased it has been confirmed that the two women missing in Ecuador have been found.’
