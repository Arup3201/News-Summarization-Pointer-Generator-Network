Doctors are baffled by an ultra-rare condition which means a three-year-old boy has grown to just 2ft 5ins tall.

Brody Land, who still wears clothes designed for children aged six to nine months, has a form of dwarfism so rare that doctors in the UK have been unable to properly diagnose him.

The toddler stands at just 74cm (2ft 5 in) tall when the average height for a boy of his age in the UK is 95cm (3ft 1in).

He is able to walk, although sometimes uses a pushchair when he gets tired, and his mother has taught him sign language because he struggles to speak.

Brody’s parents, Emma and Chris Land, have now set their sights on travelling to the U.S. where they hope specialists will be able to provide them with a diagnosis.

Mrs Land, 25, a part-time administrator, said: ‘We just need a diagnosis and I don’t want to stop until I know what he has got. I’m learning as I go along because there are no other children in the UK with the same condition.

‘I had my first three-month scan with Brody and they told me that he had Down’s syndrome, but this was not the case.

‘At 11 months old they told me he had dwarfism but they couldn’t give me a diagnosis.

‘When Brody was about two the doctors said to me that they had done everything they could and they just told us it was Brody’s syndrome.’

Brody is so small that he still wears clothes designed for children who are between six and nine months old

Doctors say Brody is the only child in the UK to have his condition so they are unable to formally diagnose him - his parents say they have been told he has 'Brody syndrome'

The mother-of-one had to give up full-time work as a nursery nurse to attend the many hospital appointments Brody required but the youngster has recently started mainstream nursery school.

Mrs Land, of Wakefield, West Yorkshire, said: ‘Brody has started going to school every morning and he absolutely loves it. He’s such a sociable little boy and he hates playing alone.

‘All the children at school look after him and hold his hand - I think they just want to protect him really. He is progressing well though and he’ll continue in mainstream education while he’s in primary school.’

Mrs Land and husband Chris, 28, a labourer, are now desperate for a diagnosis and are hoping to raise £10,000 to take him to America for specialist tests.

After a pregnancy scan, Brody's parents were told he had Down's syndrome but they were later told this was not the case and that he actually has a form of dwarfism

Brody's parents now hope to take him to see specialists in the U.S. in the hope of getting a formal diagnosis

Mrs Land said: 'When Brody was about two the doctors said to me that they had done everything they could and they just told us it was Brody's syndrome'

She said: ‘We are part of a dwarfs’ community that meets once a year and they’ve all got a diagnosis. I’d just like to say this is what he has.

‘Going to America is our last hope really. We just want a bit of closure and I won’t give up until I have done everything I can.

‘When he gets older and starts asking me questions about his condition I want to be able to say that I tried everything.’

Mrs Land says she wants answers about Brody's condition so she can answer his questions as he gets older

Mrs Land said: 'We just need a diagnosis and I don't want to stop until I know what he has got'

Consultant paediatrician Dr Andrea Nussbaumer, from Mid Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust, said: ‘We are dedicated to providing the very best possible care for all our patients and we continue to work with a number of specialists in the hope of getting an accurate diagnosis for Brody’s condition.

‘In the meantime we are concentrating on working with Brody and his family to ensure that he receives all the care and support he needs.’
