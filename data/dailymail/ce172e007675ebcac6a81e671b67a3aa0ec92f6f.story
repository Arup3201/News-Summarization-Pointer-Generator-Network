At first glance, they look like good Samaritans helping a person in a wheelchair across a busy road.

In fact, heroin addicts Adam Webster and Sarah Harcourt are kidnapping a quadriplegic man and wheeling him into a park to mug him for just £6.

The couple were arrested within 40 minutes of robbing Stephen Dooley, 38, after being caught on CCTV.

Caught on camera: Adam Webster, 38, and Sarah Harcourt, 35, abducted Stephen Dooley, 38, from a council activity centre in Norwich and pushed him to a nearby park to steal his money

Prolific offenders: Heroin addicts Adam Webster and Sarah Harcourt stole £6 and dumped their victim 

Innocent: Stephen Dooley is now terrified to go out and the robbery left his confidence in tatters, the court heard

Webster was jailed for six years 
yesterday and Harcourt was imprisoned for four years and 12 weeks for 
the crime, which has left Mr Dooley too scared to go out.

Both
 terms exceed the four years given on February 22 to Lewis Gill, who 
killed Asperger’s sufferer Andrew Young, 40, in Bournemouth last year 
with a single punch, which was also caught on CCTV.

Sentencing
 Webster, 38, and Harcourt, 35, at Norwich Crown Court, Judge Anthony 
Bate said: ‘This was a despicable crime driven by self-centred greed and
 an utter disregard for your victim’s feelings.’

The
 pair abducted Mr Dooley last August from the Vauxhall Resource Centre, a
 community centre in Norwich where he ran a book stall, and wheeled him 
out of sight before demanding his cash.

After
 they left, he managed to make his way back to the centre where staff 
called police, who tracked the pair down using security footage. 
Harcourt admitted robbery and kidnap, while Webster was found guilty in 
court.

Mr Dooley – whose 
disability makes it hard for him to communicate – used an interpreter to
 tell the court from behind a screen about his fear during the ordeal.

Chain of events: The thies are seen forcing their disabled victim across a main road and into a park on a summer's day last August

Mr
 Dooley’s father, the Reverend Gerald Dooley, described in an impact 
statement read out in court how the community centre was ‘a really big 
part of Stephen’s life’ but he ‘does not want to leave the house’ now 
and ‘is afraid and has become introverted’.

He
 had attended the centre for more than ten years and saw it as a home 
from home. In his own victim statement, Mr Dooley said: ‘Working on the 
book stall was the one thing I did by myself. I miss it lots …but now I 
am too scared to go.’

Devious: Webster and Harcourt had targeted Stephen Dooley as he attended a centre holding activities for disabled people for callously robbing him

Cast aside: After the cash was taken from Mr Dooley, who became disabled as a baby, he was just left to fend for himself. Thankfully the thieves were arrested within 40 minutes after being caught on CCTV

Detective
 Constable Jim Starling said yesterday: ‘Harcourt and Webster are the 
lowest of the low. To target a man who clearly has no means of defending
 himself or calling for help is beyond belief.’

Detective
 Sergeant Richard Dickinson praised Mr Dooley for his bravery in being a
 witness, adding: ‘Giving evidence is a traumatic experience for any 
victim of crime, but it’s particularly poignant in Steve’s case as he 
has limited means of communicating.

‘I believe his evidence was crucial in securing a guilty verdict.’
