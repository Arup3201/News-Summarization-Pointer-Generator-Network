Younis Tsouli, a convicted extremist dubbed Terrorist007. The Old Bailey heard today that he sent a letter from jail calling for jihad 

A convicted extremist dubbed Terrorist007 sent a letter to his father from a maximum security jail calling for jihad, a court heard today.

Younis Tsouli, 31, sent the letter and was also caught with a copy of al-Qaeda magazine 'Inspire' in his cell, just two months before he was due to be released from prison, the Old Bailey has heard.

The letter, which was written in Arabic and sent to his Moroccan homeland, was intercepted when he was an inmate at Long Lartin jail before he was moved to HMP Woodhill.

In the letter, Tsouli states: ‘This is a letter of advice to those members of my family who will learn their lesson.’

The letter also includes rants about Islam for several paragraphs and adds: ‘Allah gives quick rewards for those who go out for jihad.

He goes on to explain that the soldiers of Islam will be ‘granted victory or paradise' and adds, ‘there is no better action than jihad. Prepare for war, since its flames are rising.'

He also adds that those who go to fight in Syria are not fanatics and should be praised and that the people of Syria had been ‘showered with rockets.’

‘For two years the world has been playing while the children of Syria have their body parts cut in the street,’ he rants.

Meanwhile when he was asked about the al-Qaeda magazine found in his cell in HMP Woodhill, Tsouli said: ‘Its part of my legal papers. I’ve had it for ages.’

Prison officers also recovered several screwed up pieces of paper which were internet printouts showing pictures of ‘extreme Islamic nature,’ the court was told.

Tsouli simply shrugged his shoulders when asked about the papers and said ‘Do what you with it.’

When he was interviewed, Tsouli refused to comment. He told detectives: ‘I should be the one asking questions, not being asked questions.’

The copy of Inspire was an exhibit in a previous terror trial, changing hands between convicted extremists Mohammed Chowdury and Omar Latif before somehow reaching Tsouli.

The magazine name-checked Tsouli himself, using a variation of his nickname, ‘Brother Irhabi 007’, in an article listing ‘Muslim prisoners’. 

Tsouli admitted he had been given the copy of ‘Inspire’ magazine in ‘secret’ when he was at Long Lartin and it had been transferred with him when he was moved to Woodhill.

But he refused to say who had passed it to him.

Tsouli wrote the letter to his father calling for jihad while he was a prisoner at Long Lartin jail, pictured, in Worcestershire 

He explained: ‘I could not name the individual and put someone in a position where they are liable for prosecution.'

Tsouli came to Britain with his father in 2001 and became involved with Muslim extremists. He said he went protest marches over the Iraq war which he regarded as illegal.

He trained in IT and started designing and running websites for terrorists.

‘It was alleged I had assisted in the creation and maintenance of websites that allowed insurgents to upload and disseminate material,’ he said.

The material ranged from religious offerings to reports on terrorist atrocities.

Tsouli added: ‘I didn’t voice an opinion. I just allowed a platform to be available for the insurgents groups to show what was happening on the ground. He agreed that people who looked at the site might want to get involved in similar attacks.

Tsouli admitted a series of offences at Woolwich Crown Court including incitement to commit acts of terrorism, including murder in 2007.

He was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment - a term later increased to 16 years by the Court of Appeal.

He had been moved to HMP Woodhill pending his release as moves were made to deport him back to Morocco.

Tsouli denies possessing a document likely to be useful to persons committing or preparing acts of terrorism. The trial continues at the Old Bailey, pictured 

He said he initially did not want to be deported when he was released because he feared being tortured when in his homeland.

He wanted to remain in Britain, even though he did not like the food, weather and found regional accents difficult to understand.

‘As a convicted terrorist I would have been under a lot of scrutiny. There were rumours about torture being used,’ he said.

‘If I had been deported I would have been under severe and continuing danger.’

He said when he was given the Inspire magazine he was told it might be ‘of interest.’

His name as 007terrorist was given in a list of prisoners under the headline ‘Oh Allah free the Muslim prisoners.’

‘It was disappointing my name was still featuring in the Al Qaeda publication,’ said Tsouli.

‘I wanted to move on from this offence, having served a nine year sentence.

‘The last thing you want is any mention like this in a publication related to Al Qaeda.’

Tsouli said he had the magazine for about six months before he went to Woodhill.

He was asked to explain several times why he had not thrown it away.

‘It was evidence and it might have been of interest. It was of concern in relation to my deportation,’ he said.

‘I can’t give you answer. I just kept it for some reason or another.

‘I just don’t necessarily throw stuff away that might be of use.’

But he then decided he wanted to be deported back to Morocco because he was told if his immigration status was not resolved he could be made to stay in jail and serve his entire sentence.

‘I had not read the document since I had been at Wood Hill. I would have got rid of it,’ he said.

‘There was no way I could have left the prison with that document.’

Tsouli, of no fixed address, denies possessing a document likely to be useful to persons committing or preparing acts of terrorism.

The trial continues.
