Call it an unsolved mystery.

An angered wife exacerbated a pungent domestic dispute after allegedly spraying vanilla-scented Lysol on her husband who passed gas that ‘was bad enough to cause her to almost puke.’

But the details are still up in the air.

Michael Manatis, 46, told a local deputy in Spartanburg County, South Carolina, that his wife, Shannon Manatis, 41, had ‘sprayed the Lysol in his eyes,’ according to a police report.

Shannon claimed she reached for the can of air-freshener and sprayed it in the ‘area.’

In response to the spraying, her husband allegedly threw water on Shannon and then tossed a plastic water bottle at her.

Shannon said that she was hit in the back of her head with a glass of tea.

The dispute was never legally resolved.

‘Upon my original arrival to the residence there was a clear liquid on the back door and floor,’ the deputy wrote in the police statement. ‘This was not consistent with tea but is believed to be water.’

Michael told the deputy tasked with sorting out the story that an ‘upset stomach’ prompted him to pass the gas that infuriated his spouse.

After consulting with a local judge, the police officer determined that there was a lack of probable cause to issue an arrest warrant.

Not tea: 'Upon my original arrival to the residence there was a clear liquid on the back door and floor,' the deputy wrote in the police statement. 'This was not consistent with tea but is believed to be water.'
