By the time Richard Cantlupe received the news of the Connecticut 
school shooting that left 20 children dead, his students had already 
gone home for the weekend.

And so the American history teacher at Westglades Middle School in 
Parkland, Fla., was bracing himself for an onslaught of painful, often 
unanswerable questions when they returned to class Monday.

'It's going to be a tough day,' he said. 'This was like our 9/11 for school teachers.'

country were wrestling with how best to quell 
children's fears about returning to school for the first time since the 
massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn.

School administrators have pledged to add police patrols, review security plans and make guidance counselors available.

In Ridgefield, Conn., schools went on lockdown after reports came in of a 'suspicious incident' cause buses to reroute elementary school students to a different school before police announced there was no sign of dangerous activity.

And yet, it was pretty near impossible to eliminate the anxiety and apprehension many were feeling.

'For them, you need to pretend that you're OK,' said Jessica 
Kornfeld, the mother of 10-year-old twins in Pinecrest, Fla., a suburb 
of Miami. 'But it's scary.'

Connecticut Education Commissioner Stefan Pryor said his agency was 
sending a letter to school superintendents across the state Sunday 
evening, providing a list of written prompts for classroom teachers to 
help them address the shooting in Newtown with their students.

'In many instances, teachers will want to discuss the events because 
they are so recent and so significant, but they won't necessarily know 
how to go about it,' he said.

Cantlupe said he will tell his students that his No. 1 job is to keep
them safe, and that like the teachers in Connecticut, he would do 
anything to make sure they stay out of harm's way.

He is also beginning 
to teach about the Constitution and expects to take questions on the 
Second Amendment.

'It's going to lead right into the controversy over gun control,' he said.

In an effort to ensure their students' safety and calm parents' 
nerves, school districts across the United States have asked police 
departments to increase patrols and have sent messages to parents 
outlining safety plans that they assured them are regularly reviewed and
rehearsed.

Some officials refused to discuss plans publicly in detail, but it 
was clear that vigilance will be high this week at schools everywhere in
the aftermath of one of the worst mass shootings in U.S. history: 
Twenty-six people were killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School, most 
children ages 6 and 7.

The gunman then shot and killed himself.

Northern Virginia's Fairfax County Public Schools, the largest school
system in the Washington area with about 181,000 students, will provide
additional police patrols and counselors.

'This is not in response to any specific threat but rather a police 
initiative to enhance safety and security around the schools and to help
alleviate the understandably high levels of anxiety,' Superintendent 
Jack Dale said Sunday.

Dennis Carlson, superintendent of Anoka-Hennepin School District in 
Minnesota, said a mental health consultant will meet with school 
officials Monday, and there will be three associates — one to work with 
the elementary, middle and high schools, respectively.

As the day goes 
on, officials will be on the lookout for any issues that arise, and 
extra help will go where needed.

'We are concerned for everybody — our staff and student body and 
parents,' Carlson said. 'It's going to be a day where we are all going 
to be hypervigilant, I know that.'

In Tucson, Ariz., where a gunman in January 2011 killed six and 
wounded 12 others, including U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, the largest 
school district in the state increased security after Friday's shooting.

Planning was under way at the Tucson Unified School District to help 
teachers and students with grief and fear, and the district was working 
with Tucson police on security, district spokeswoman Cara Rene said.

In the Chicago Public Schools, the nation's third-largest school 
district, officials said they would reiterate their existing safety and 
emergency-management plans to keep more than 400,000 students safe, and 
deploy police or counselors to schools as needed.

'With this incident, we took it as an opportunity to remind all of 
our principals to review and refresh their individual 
emergency-management plans and remind staff of standard safety 
protocol,' said Chief Safety and Security Officer Jadine Chou.

Many schools will be holding a moment of silence Monday and will fly flags at half-staff.

Meanwhile, at home, many parents were trying their best to allay 
their children's fears while coping with their own.

Kornfeld said her 
town is a lot like Newtown: a place where people generally feel safe 
being at home without the doors locked and playing outside after school.

'Why would that happen there?' she said. 'It kind of rocks everything.'

She sat down with her son and daughter after school Friday and 
explained to them what had happened.

She reminded her children that they
were with her, and safe.

'But it could have been us,' her son replied.

Hoping to reassure them, she drove the children to their elementary 
school over the weekend. She wanted them to know it was still a safe 
place.

'Our school is the same as it was when you left,' she told them. 'It's going to be fine.'
