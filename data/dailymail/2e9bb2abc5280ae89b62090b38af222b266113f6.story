This weekend's FA Cup action unsurprisingly brought up a number of talking points.

Here, Sportsmail's Graham Poll talks us through the key events from Liverpool's FA Cup quarter-final draw with Blackburn on Sunday.

Andre Marriner was well served by not giving decisions at Anfield, where there were four decent penalty appeals.

While one could make a case — certainly technically — for three of the four to be given, I felt Marriner got every one of those decisions right.

Liverpool’s best chance of a penalty was their first appeal when Adam Lallana went down under pressure from Matt Kilgallon.

While slow-motion replays perhaps indicated that Kilgallon may not have played the ball, he certainly appeared to from all angles at full speed. 

The other two appeals in the first half were for handball and both were accidental.

Early in the second half, Daniel Sturridge felt Kilgallon’s arm make contact so he went to ground, knowing he wasn’t going to reach the pass played for him. 

Once again, Marriner was right to allow play to continue, understanding that not every contact is a foul.
