Britain has been beaten by the spending bug again, buying more in May this year than since records began.

Online shoppers help fuel a boom in retail sales, suggesting signs of economic recovery are giving people more confidence to spend their money.

Food, clothes and household appliances were all up, as retailers bounced back from the unseasonably cold April.

The boom for shops and internet retailers will provide a boost for George Osborne who last night struck a notably more upbeat tone on the economy.

The Chancellor claimed that ‘Britain has left intensive care’ and ‘the economic news here in Britain has been better in recent months’.

New figures show retail sales volumes increased 2.1 per cent in May month-on-month - significantly ahead of economists’ hopes for a 0.8 per cent increase.

A price war at supermarkets lured shoppers to spend on food, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.

The ONS added almost all store types reported a rebound in sales from April, which was hit by unseasonably cold weather.

It said: ‘Feedback from retailers suggested that promotions on summer ranges led to this increase in sales.’

Compared with a year earlier, retail sales volumes in May were up 1.9 per cent, as shoppers bought the biggest quantity of retail goods on record.

The amount spent on retail goods also rose 2.1 per cent month-on-month and was up 3.1 per cent on a year earlier.

Internet sales continued to soar, the ONS added, with spending increasing 10.3 per cent on a year earlier. Online sales now account for 9.7 per cent of retail spending.

The amount of food bought increased by 3.5 per cent month-on-month, the ONS said, while sales of clothes, shoes and textiles rose 1.4 per cent on the month. Sales of household goods increased 0.7 per cent month-on-month.

In his keynote Mansion House speech last night, Mr Osborne said: ‘The economy is growing.

‘Record numbers are in work. Surveys of confidence and future activity are stronger. Let me say tonight: the British economy is healing. 

‘But while Britain has left intensive care, we still need to secure the recovery – and make sure we continue to treat the ailments that brought us low in the first place.’

Buoyant retail sales will add to signs of recovery in the economy, fuelling hopes the UK’s output can grow by 0.5 per cent in the second quarter.

Martin Beck, UK economist at Capital Economics, said the figures are ‘further evidence that a recovery in the UK economy may be taking root’.

Alan Clarke, fixed income strategy director at Scotiabank, said the UK was on a ‘food binge’ in May.

‘This volatility in retail sales is all about food,’ he said. ‘Either there was a big influence from the poor weather, the timing of Easter caused some distortions or the whole country was on a crash diet in April that was then reversed in May.’

David Tinsley, UK economist at BNP Paribas, said: ‘Overall, the figures today are consistent with a fairly solid quarterly gross domestic product (GDP) figure for the second quarter.

‘The question is whether this momentum can be sustained into the second half of the year. We remain concerned economy-wide real income growth will not be sufficient to see this, though for now the UK is having a good run.’

British Retail Consortium director general Helen Dickinson said optimism is gradually returning to the sector.

She said: ‘UK retailers have had to work hard to respond to the volatile weather and economic challenges, but the signs are that their promotional activity has been paying off.

‘Customers remain price-conscious, but have been responding well to the good deals that are available.’
