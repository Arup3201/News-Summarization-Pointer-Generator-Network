Britain is the only major economy to have given far more than its ‘fair share’ of humanitarian aid to Syria, a report has found.

This year, the UK has delivered close to £200million of aid to the region where the civil war has cost over 100,000 lives and left around 2million people homeless.

It puts Britain’s contribution at 154 per cent of our ‘fair share’, which would be only £125million, according to an analysis by Oxfam of how much money countries are giving to the crisis, relative to their wealth.

This year, the UK has delivered close to £200million of aid to the region where the civil war has cost over 100,000 lives

Despite having already exceeded this level by £68million, the amount delivered so far is only half the £400million the government has pledged to hand over since the conflict began two and a half years ago.

The UK has paid a staggering 154 per cent of its 'fair share' towards aid in Syria

David Cameron, who lost a Commons vote on military strikes against the regime of dictator Bashar al-Assad, has promised the UK – the second largest donor to the conflict after the US - will ‘lead the world’ on getting food and medical aid to victims of the conflict. 

By contrast other major economies have fallen short – with France and Italy handing over just 47 per cent of their fair share, at £67million and £53million respectively.

None of the rest of the G20 group of 
countries – including the US, Canada, Japan and Germany – have met their
target except the UK and Saudi Arabia according to Oxfam.

The US is the largest donor delivering
over £500million this year. But given its wealth and population this is
only 63 per cent of its fair share which was put at £800million.

Russia
– a close ally of Assad – gave just 3 per cent of what would be 
expected given the size of its economy, the report found.

But
bottom of the list was New Zealand, whose economy has grown faster than
expected this year, but has given just £62,000– 1 per cent of its fair 
share calculated at £6.7million.

Mr
Cameron said earlier this month: ‘We are already the second largest aid
donor in delivering the humanitarian aid that is so needed both in 
Syria and in the neighbouring countries like Jordan and Turkey. We’ll go
on doing that.’

Despite having already exceeded this level by £68million, the amount delivered so far is only half the £400million the government has pledged to hand over

He said the aid given so far had saved
‘tens of thousands of lives’, and that he would push other countries to
do more at the recent G20 summit, however many have failed to act.

Claire
Seaward, Oxfam’s campaigns manager for the Syria response, said: ‘The 
crisis has got a lot worse this year and there are still a lot more 
needs on the ground. Although our government has given 154 per cent, we 
would still expect them to give more.’

David Cameron has promised the UK will 'lead the world' on getting food and medical aid to victims of the conflict

The
charity analysed each countries’ Gross National Income (GNI), which is 
its wealth per head of population, and how much of the millions of 
pounds it has pledged have actually been delivered to aid workers on the
ground.

The list of nations includes 
28 traditional donor countries, and also Middle Eastern nations who have
donated to Syria mainly Gulf countries which support the rebels.

Only
eight countries were gauged to be giving sufficient funds, with 
oil-rich Kuwait the most generous at more than four and a half times its
fair share – at £200million. Other countries which exceeded their fair 
share were Luxemburg, Denmark, Norway and Sweden.

Oxfam’s
figures include all the aid given directly and via the United Nations, 
European Union and charities such as the Red Cross and Oxfam so far this
year.

The head of Oxfam’s 
Syria programme, Colette Fearon, said: ‘While economic times are tough, 
we are facing the largest man-made humanitarian disaster in two decades 
and we have to seriously address it.

‘The
scale of this crisis is unprecedented and some countries must start to 
show their concerns to the crisis in Syria by putting their hands in 
their pockets. This is not the time for pledges. The situation demands 
committed funds in order to save lives.’

International
development secretary Justine Greening visited Syrian refugees in 
Jordan this month, and said: ‘Over one million Syrian children are now 
refugees. Many have seen unimaginable horrors and all face an uncertain 
future.

‘We must ensure 
these children have sufficient food, shelter and medical care, but we 
must also provide the psychological support and education needed for 
their longer term well-being.

'In
the future it will be these children who have to help rebuild a more 
peaceful, democratic Syria, so we must give them the skills they need to
do that.’

If you think that all of that money went to charities and helping the Syrian people, you're kidding yourselves.

How many teachers, policemen, nurses etc could the extra have employed? Britain first, Syria wouldn't give us a bean if it was the other way round I'm afraid. Harsh but true.

It's what one would call 'enabling'. It is effectively feeding the monster. Which would you prefer then, 'aid' or bombs?- ethel m, london, United Kingdom, 20/9/2013 17:32 +++++++++++++ Neither.

Cameron and Hague are only concerned about other parliamentarians' views of the Tories as the 'nasty' party, so they are constantly looking for ways to show how 'caring' they are (by using tax-payers' money and all the while looking to their future 'careers' on the world stage). Unfortunately, this is all that concerns them in their little house of party-politics; their view is that this country and its tax payers are of secondary importance to their party's standing in the House of Commons.

Politicians promoting their own egos by spending taxpayers' money, was ever thus.
