A body was last night found in a rural grave site during the hunt for a pretty 16-year-old blonde girl who has been missing for almost six weeks.

Police in North Ogden, Utah, are waiting for an autopsy but a county official said there is a ‘strong possibility’ that it is Alexis Rasmussen’s body.

The teenager went missing on September 10 and was last seen at a local pharmacy store in North Ogden after babysitting for a family friend.

Vanished: The pretty teenager went missing on September 10 and was last seen at a local pharmacy store in North Ogden after babysitting for a family friend

She was babysitting for Eric and Dea 
Millerberg around one mile from her home and her mother said she could 
stay overnight at their house.

But she left that night, saying she 
was going to meet a friend - before her parents called police 24 
hours later when she did not arrive home.

Alexis sent a few texts while 
babysitting and around the time she was at the pharmacy, but there was 
no activity on her phone after that, records show.

The unidentified body was found on Tuesday after a 
tip from a confidential source, North Ogden Police Chief Polo Afuvai 
told the Salt Lake Tribune.

Smiles: Friends say they would have heard from Alexis if she had run away

Distinguishable: Alexis had a piercing on her lower left lip and upper right lip

Police have identified suspects but 
will not reveal who they are as the investigation continues. An autopsy 
was being carried out on Wednesday.

Dee Smith, Weber County’s chief law 
enforcement official, told the Salt Lake Tribune there is a ‘strong 
possibility’ that it is Alexis’s body.

The girl’s best friend Brenna Cain 
cried as she told the newspaper ‘it never would have happened’ if she 
had been with Alexis that night.

Pictures of Alexis, a blonde girl with two face piercings, have been shown on television, put on
Facebook and plastered across the town on flyers.

She had run away from her home once in the past, but was only gone for a day and texted her mother and called her brother during that time.
