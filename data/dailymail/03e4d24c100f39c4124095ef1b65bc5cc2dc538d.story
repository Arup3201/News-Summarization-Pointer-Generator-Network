Her infamous portrayal of a cool, no-nonsense assassin with no reason left to live but revenge earned Uma Thurman an MTV Movie Award for Best Female Performance. Now the role earns her another accolade, however dubious, as she tops Lovefilm's list of cinema's most lethal ladies.

Thurman's quirkiness and calm brutality makes her one of Tarantino's most unforgettable characters.

His only choice, when Thurman became pregnant Tarantino refused to recast her and paused production.

Uma Thurman plays the role of vengeful Beatrix Kiddo aka The Bride in the film directed by Quentin Tarantino

The plot follows Black Mamba (Thurman) skillfully stalking the 
world for a group of gangsters and traitors - the same people she used to count as friends - who mercilessly massacred 
her loved ones on her wedding day. And she leaves no stone unturned, slaughtering 72.

With a total of 50 killings, Cherry Darling, another of Tarantino's heroines played by Rose McGowan, gets the number two spot. You can imagine the go-go dancer isn't too happy after several zombies tear off her right leg.

Through the film she fights her way out of a hospital populated by zombies and attacks a rapist by snapping off her makeshift leg across his face and jabbing the remainder into his eye.

The real action begins when Cherry's 
broken wooden leg is replaced with a modified M4 Carbine with a M203 
grenade launcher attachment, upon when she kills the rapist and many other 
zombies with it.

Other contenders include 11-year-old vigilante Hit-Girl played by Chloe Moretz, the youngest by far, a self-styled superhero trained by her father.

When drug dealers and thugs threaten her frenemy and fellow costumed vigilante Kick-Ass she steps in to rescue him.

Throughout the story our heroes run into conflict with the thugs many times until finally Hit-Girl storms their headquarters, killing them all and taking her to third place in the list.

Former assassin Charly Baltimore (Geena Davis) overcomes amnesia in action thriller The Long Kiss Goodnight to rediscover her expert CIA skills, racking up 32 victims in the process, a figure which guarantees her fourth place in the list.

The fascination with vengeful female protagonists in strong lead roles - the new femme fatales - is on the increase in popular culture, neo-noir crime thrillers and graphic novels.

The modern-day cinematic leading ladies are a new slick and deadly breed, rather than the helpless, child-like, waiting to be rescued roles of the past.
