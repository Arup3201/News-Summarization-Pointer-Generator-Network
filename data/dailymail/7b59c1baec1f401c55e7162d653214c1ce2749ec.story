What colour is this dress? That was the question that sparked a fierce internet debate, with social media users, among them Kanye West and Kim Kardashian, arguing over its true hue.

Now a new photo has emerged that looks set to end the row once and for all, and reveals that those who claimed it was blue and black are correct.

In the picture, the dress is being worn by Cecilia Bleasdale, the mother of the bride, and is clearly blue and black rather than cream and gold.

What a wedding: Grace posed on her wedding day with another guest from the wedding 

Now her family have claimed the experience of picture of the dress going viral has been, 'very weird.' 

Cecilia's daughter Grace married her husband Keir Johnston in Colonsay, Scotland, earlier this month with her mother choosing to wear the £50 dress from Roman Originals. 

Cecilia, who lives in Blackpool, had sent Grace a picture of the dress which she had then shared online. 

Family friend Caitlin McNeil, 21, then posted it to Tumblr after a debate broke out among their friends about what colour the dress was. 

It promptly went viral, with posts arguing over the dress's original colours - and science behind the debate - viewed and shared millions of times.

Grace's sister Angie McPhee, 37, also from Blackpool, said: 'It's my mum's dress. It was my sister Grace's wedding on Colonsay.'

'Mum sent it to Grace to give the dress a thumbs up or thumbs down. 'It was sent originally to my sister then my mum sent the picture to me and Grace said 'Why is she wearing white and gold to the wedding? We were shocked my mum had chosen a light coloured dress.'

Angie continued: 'Originally I saw it a white and gold. Grace saw it as white and gold - her fiance saw it as blue and black and they had a bit of a tadoo about it.'

She continued: 'The actual dress is blue and black. Only that picture is different.'

Saying their vows: Grace married her husband Keir in Scotland earlier this month her family have spoken out about the dress going viral 

The happy day: One of Grace's friends has revealed that she has found the whole experience 'very weird' after waking up to messages and missed calls about the dress on her honeymoon

Lindsay Maden, 26, also from Blackpool, was a bridesmaid at the wedding. She said: 'It's mental. Grace showed me the original picture and she thought it was white and gold.

'Then we had the wedding and Caitlin posted it online. I can't comprehend it. For us it was literally like, 'that's a bit weird' and that was it.

'The dress was royal blue and as black as you can get. The wedding was brilliant, it was lovely.'

Lindsay said she had sent a message to Grace in Jamaica, who told her she had received lots of missed calls and messages, adding: 'It's dead weird waking up and seeing my phone has gone mental.' 

Keir, the groom, posted to his Facebook: 'You know it's gonna be a strange day when you wake up and after 30 seconds of interneting can turn to Grace Johnston and say 'So Kim sees white and gold, but Kanye sees blue and black.' 

Indeed Kim and Kanye did weight in on the debate. Kim Kardashian asked her 29.4million Twitter followers to help settle a disagreement between herself and husband Kanye West.

Unfortunately for Kim, Kanye has been proved correct by the new photo, while she has been left to eat humble pie.

The astonishing spread of the dress debate has left Miss McNeill shocked, with the 21-year-old telling Business Insider that she never expected the photograph to go viral.

'I thought my followers on Tumblr would maybe have a good reaction but I never would have considered that Taylor Swift and Mindy Kaling would be tweeting about it.'

Miss McNeill also went on to reveal why she posted the snap in the first place and said that the original shot came from Mrs Bleasdale herself who bought the dress in high-street retailer Roman Originals.

'What happened was two of my close friends were actually getting married and the mother of the bride took a photo of the dress to send to her daughter,' she said.

'When my friend showed the dress to her fiancee, they disagreed on the colour. All of our friends disagreed.'

With the debate fresh in her mind, Miss McNeill shared the photo on a Tumblr fan page dedicated to a talent manager Sarah Weichel.

Then, without Weichel promoting the post or realising it was there, it went viral, with scores of celebrities getting involved in the argument.

Kim Kardashian said: 'What color is that dress? I see white & gold. Kanye sees black & blue, who is color blind?'

Actress Mindy Kaling also joined the discussion, writing on Twitter: 'IT'S A BLUE AND BLACK DRESS! ARE YOU F***ING KIDDING ME'. 

Even more colors: The dress can also be purchased in white and black or a pink and black combination

True colors: The dress, made by the company Roman Originals, is in fact blue and black striped

Her friend and fellow actor BJ Novak replied with a succinct post that simply read: 'white and gold.' 

Then recent Oscar winner Julianne Moore jumped in, writing to Novak and Kaling to complain: 'What's the matter with u guys, it's white and gold.'

To that, Novak replied to Moore; 'Thank you! And congratulations on your Oscar, which Mindy thinks is purple and green.'  

Taylor Swift wrote; 'I don't understand this odd dress debate and I feel like it's a trick somehow. I'm confused and scared. PS it's OBVIOUSLY BLUE AND BLACK.'   

And Justin Bieber kept his fans happy by telling them, correctly as it turns out, that he sees 'blue and black'.

Some celebrities avoided the issue completely and contented themselves by simply declaring the dress ugly.

Model Chrissy Teigen told her 655,000 Twitter followers: 'F*** the dress it's heinous', while Oscar-winner Jared Leto branded it 'fugly'. 

With the release of the new photo, the bodycon dress, which is made by British company Roman Originals, has been definitively identified as being black and blue.

There company also makes also white, pink and red options, all with black lace. There are, however, no white and gold versions to be had.

There's science behind the reason why some people see black on blue while others are just as certain that they see gold on white.

The simple answer is that the picture is an optical illusion.

Objects reflect light at certain wavelengths, or colors, and the human brain determines the color of an object by taking in its reflected light. But this perception can be thrown off balance by the color of nearby objects.

With the photo of the dress, the surrounding colors are so muddled that the brain isn't sure what to make of the dress itself.

As Wired.com points out, a digital analysis of the dress photo shows that one of the spots of black trim is actually orange in the photo.

Thus, people who perceive the surrounding area as dark are likely to see the blue in the dress as white and the black colors as gold. It all just depends on the manner that the brain perceives and processes color.

Jay Neitz, a University of of Washington neuroscience tells Wired: 'I've studied individual differences in color vision for 30 years, and this is one of the biggest individual differences I've ever seen.' He sees gold on white.
