Surrounded by explosions and flames, a man can be seen calmly sitting with his drink casually surveying the scene.

But this isn't the latest Bond film - it's is a video of how one man dealt with fireworks being hurled into his local pub in Derby.

The incredible footage shows people running for their lives surrounded by flames after arsonists threw huge fireworks into a pub.

Cool customer: The bemused regular watches the fireworks fly around the room as he sits at the pub table

The regular brushes a spark out of his hair as he stays seated during the explosives

The front bar of The Grampian, in 
Sinfin, Derby was filled with smoke and customers had to run outside the
pub to get their breath on Tuesday night.

But while everyone else - sensibly - ran for cover, the customer coolly acts as if nothing is wrong whatsoever.

At one point the regular even brushes a 
spark out of his hair before putting his hand on his hip and then picking up his 
bar stool as he gets up to as if to leave, then calmly watches the flames and fireworks fly around the room.

The regular stops to pick up his bar stool - but does not look like he's in any rush to leave the pub

As plumes of smoke filled the room, licensee Philippa Macdonald said she feared for her 13-year-old son, Greg, who was sleeping in his room above the pub.

Amid the panic she and partner Karl Richards, both 36, managed to phone the police and fire brigade, who arrived within minutes to clear the front room of the pub of smoke.

Philippa said: 'It was absolutely petrifying. The fireworks were banging and popping around the room, flames were shooting everywhere.

'The regulars did not know what was happening and smoke and fireworks filled the place. It’s a miracle nobody was hurt.

'I was so scared that the flames would take hold and spread.

Karl Richards and Philippa MacDonald, are shocked why someone threw a firework inside their pub, while their son Greg, 13, was in bed at the time

'We are just so fortunate that the pub only had about four or five customers. It was quite late at night.

'If it had been an hour earlier the place would have been packed because there were a lot of people in here watching the football.

'I’ve rung all the other pubs in the area warning them about what has happened to us.'

Karl said: 'I have no idea why we have been targeted. It seems like it was just a random attack.

'We don’t think this was kids, it was definitely adults because these were fireworks of the expensive variety.

'We were stood behind the bar when we saw the front door open slightly and then we saw a flame.

'Someone shouted something like "have it, take that"and the first firework was thrown in the door, followed by the second one.

'They started fizzing and banging. One of the fireworks had 12 smaller ones that shot out from it. Both were pretty big and must have cost quite a lot of money.

'One was about eight inches square and the other was circular and a similar size.

'I can only think the reason there was no fire is because the carpet is fireproof and there was nothing too flammable lying around to catch light.'

The incident happened at 11.25pm on October 23.

A spokesman for Derbyshire Police said its officers were studying CCTV of the incident and appealed for information from anyone who may have seen suspicious activity in the area at the time.

He said: 'At 11.30pm we were called to The Grampian Pub after reports of lit fireworks being thrown through the front door.

'There were customer still drinking at the time and thankfully no-one was hurt.'
