A Wisconsin family was left reeling from the tragic death of their 14-month-old son who was mauled to death by his babysitter's two pit bulls Tuesday.

The child, identified as Dax Borchardt, died nearly three hours after the attack while in the care of 30-year-old Susan Iwicki.

Iwicki was also injured in the attack at her house in Walworth when her pets lost control and lunged at the child.

Little miracle: Family friends said that the Borchardts had spent a long time trying for a baby

Walworth County Sheriff's department said they received a 911 call from Ms Iwicki's home at N2037 North Lakeshore Drive at 12.46pm Tuesday to say she and the boy were being attacked by the pit bulls.

The toddler was taken to Mercy-Walworth Medical Center before being airlifted to the Children's Hospital of Wisconsin where he died from critical injuries at about 3:30pm.

The dogs were removed from the house and euthanized by a local veterinarian. It is unclear at this point if Iwicki will face any charges in connection to the boy's death.

Walworth County Sheriff's Office Captain Dana Nigbor told GazetteXtra.com that 'unless something drastically changes,' the investigation likely will not be a criminal one.

An autopsy is expected to be perfomed on little Dax sometime today.

Friends of the boy's family told WISN 12 News how his parents had spent a long time trying to conceive a baby.

'[He had the] biggest eyes, great smile,' family friend Valerie Brylow told WTMJ. 'He was a great little boy.'

Dax's
parents have been identified by MailOnline as Kimbelry Sucharski 
Borchardt and Jeff Borchardt, a local DJ who goes by the stage name Mix 
Master Bogart.

Fatal pit bull attacks involving children and adults alike have been on the rise in recent years.

In 2011, seven children five years old and younger were mauled to death by dogs of that breed nationwide, along with 15 adults.

In 2012, a total of 23 Americans were killed by pit bulls, including nine children, the youngest of them, Makayala Darnell, was only three days old.

Of all the fatalities that year, 34 per cent  involved more than one dog.

So far this year, at least four people were killed by dogs, all of them pit bulls.

Among the most recent victims were four-year-old Christian Gormanous, age four, and Isaiah Aguilar, age two, both from Texas.

In the eight-year period from 2005 to 2012, pit bulls and Rottweilers, the second most lethal breed, accounted for 73 per cent of the total 251 recorded deaths.

Pit bulls make up less than 5 per cent of the total US dog population.                                                            Source: Dogsbite.org

Last night, 
the boy's dad posted a heart-breaking and angry message on his Facebook 
page, vowing to do everything in his power to make sure that the pit 
bull breed is 'bred out.'

In
his tirade, Mr Borchardt insisted that Iwicki's pets were not 
abused or mistreated, claiming that 'they are naturally wired...to bite 
down on flesh and lot let go.'

'I
always thought my little chiuawawa [sic] would be MURDERED by a 
pitbull,' he wrote. 'I never thought it would be our baby boy....I will 
have that picture seared in my head forever.'

Two
hours later, Borchardt took to the social media site again, posting an 
unsettling message conveying that he wished to have died instead of his 
son.

'Please god, just take
my life and give it to Dax....it shoudve [sic] been me,' the post read. 'I'm a
complete waste of a human being and this is gods [sic] way of paying me
back!'

Friends and 
sympathetic strangers alike responded by offering their support and urging the heartbroken husband 
and father not to give up for the sake of his wife.

'Be
strong and carry on....its [sic] a loss that never heals, but each day 
makes the burden lighter,' Keeth Furan wrote on Facebook.

Another friend of the father, Nicole Jennison, told WISN 12: 'When he was with his kid, it was just all smiles.

'He didn’t care about anything else in the world, and now this happened. It breaks my heart.'
