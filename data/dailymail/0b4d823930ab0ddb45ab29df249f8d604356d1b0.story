Despite a £5,000-a-week housing allowance courtesy of British taxpayers, they struggled to find a home in London.

The new Bank of England Governor’s wife even publicly bemoaned the lack of suitable accommodation after her husband landed the top job.

But now Canadian Mark Carney has finally found somewhere to spend his perk – a six-bedroom £3million property.

Expensive taste: The designer kitchen

Renting: Mark and Diana Carney

The landlords have spent £1million transforming a semi-detached house from three flats into a single luxury dwelling.

Its renovated interior boasts a gym, cellar and outside there are landscaped gardens stretching a long way back from the house.

The master bedroom suite is laid out over 600sq ft and includes a huge dressing room and a marble bathroom with his-and-hers sinks.

Downstairs, the designer kitchen has sliding doors leading out to the garden and a spiral staircase and cellar.

For Mr Carney, who has four daughters, the fact that the house also has five bathrooms was surely a clincher. The property has no air-conditioning – a bête noire of eco-conscious Mr and Mrs Carney.

There is even an adjoining  flat with its own entrance that can be used as guest accomodation.

Luxury: One of the five bathrooms in the London mansion

The Carneys, both 48, have not moved into the house yet. Mr Carney, a former £1million-a-year Goldman Sachs banker, started work at the Bank of England on Monday, having been poached by Chancellor George Osborne from the Bank of Canada for a five-year term.

He is currently lodging in West London. His British wife, Diana, and their daughters are on a summer holiday.

Mr Carney was lured from Canada with an £874,000 pay packet – about £100,000 more than predecessor Sir Mervyn King earned – which includes a £250,000-a-year housing allowance, or £4,800 a week. After tax, it works out as £11,041 a month towards his rent which is believed to be nearly £15,000 per month.

Last night Labour MP John Mann, a member of the Treasury select committee, said: ‘It’s extraordinary that we are paying for him to have this big house. Ordinary people who have to fund their own rent out of their own wages will wonder why they have to pay his rent as well. He is leading the charge for wage austerity in public and the private sector, and this makes people think he is from a different world.’

Light and airy: The master bedroom also boasts a huge dressing room

Matthew Sinclair, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, added: ‘Most people have to pay the rent from their own salary so Mr Carney’s taxpayer-funded mansion is sure to raise eyebrows. Politicians must hold him and his pay package to account so taxpayers judge for themselves whether he is worth all this money.’

But leading Lib Dem peer Lord Oakeshott said: ‘My view is, if he sorts the economy out, it’s worth every penny.’  The Carneys have let out their house in Ottawa, Canada, for around £1,000 a week.

In March, Mrs Carney – an environmental campaigner who recently declared war on teabags – revealed their worries about finding a house in London. She tweeted they would struggle because of an influx of wealthy French fleeing their socialist government’s high taxes.

Comfort: The sitting room leads through to a further large lounge

The younger Carney children have enrolled in a local junior school and the elder two are going to different secondary schools – all fee-paying establishments which will cost their parents £18,970 per term.

Mrs Carney was born in Cheltenham to a pig farmer and attended £31,000-a-year Marlborough College in Wiltshire. The couple met at Oxford University in the 1980s.

In Canada, Mr Carney was dubbed a ‘rock star banker’ for his genius in keeping the economy growing as others shrank. He has already signalled good news for homeowners by suggesting interest rates will stay low for the foreseeable future.
