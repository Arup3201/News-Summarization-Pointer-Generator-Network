Motor industry bosses must learn to make cars that women want, says Britain’s leading car executive.

Firms are failing to make cars that appeal to females - paying more attention to a car’s horsepower than to the effect of high heels on leg-room and whether seats fit women’s backs better than men’s.

This is despite the purchasing power of women who, even if they don’t buy a car themselves, are the key influence in seven out of ten car purchases.

Dr Andy Palmer, executive vice-president of Nissan, said research showed half of all women are unhappy with their cars and three-quarters feel ‘misunderstood’.

A leading motoring expert has claimed that half of all women are unhappy with their cars and three-quarters feel 'misunderstood'. He added there was a need to train more women engineers to design and create the 'female-friendly' cars of the future

There was a need to train more women engineers to design and create the ‘female-friendly cars of the future.

And if Britain and Europe didn’t grasp the challenge it will be overtaken by booming China which already educates three times more women engineers than the UK, he said,.

Dr Palmer, who lives and works in Japan but whose formative career was in the UK car industry, said: ‘Our industry is failing the largest and most influential customer segment in the world.’

He cited uncomfortable seats that were prone to causing more back pain to women rather than men, the lack of space for prams, and the sexist sales patter of predominantly male showroom sales staff.

Engineers must learn to pay more attention to how air conditioning affects a woman’s sandalled feet, or how diamond engagement rings can scratch the car door lacquer.

Firms wrongly pay more attention to a car's horsepower than to the effect of high heels on leg-room and whether seats fit women's backs better than men's

And superfluous ‘boy-toy’ gadgets should be replaced by accessories that actually serve a purpose.

He added:’Globally, 50 per cent of women are dissatisfied with their car. And a huge 74 per cent of women feel misunderstood by automakers.

‘I know these statistics sound like they are talking about their lovers not their cars, but the reality is our industry is failing the largest and most influential customer segment in the world.’

Dr Palmer, who has been rated by AutoExpress magazine as the most powerful Briton in the global motor industry, said that a step-change was needed and must be more than cosmetic.

More women needed to be employed on the shop-floor - as well as the design and marketing departments - to make a real difference.

He said: ‘One factor is the lack of women in our business. I’m sure that Nissan is not untypical in employing less than 10per cent female managers in our ranks.

‘But our UK universities produce less than 9 per cent of female engineers each year. That compares with China at about 30 per cent.’

He believes universities could help by running fewer hairdressing courses and training more female engineers who could help to design the female-friendly cars of the future.

He said: ‘We need fewer hairdressing courses and more job creation based around those from a technology and mathematical background.

‘If a car company does not have female engineers that is a competitive weakness. Generally the car industry is not seen as female friendly. The best way to address that is to have more females in every part.’ 

His message was delivered to top car 
industry bosses at the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders’ 
annual motor industry conference in London.

Leading motor industry executive Sue Robinson,  director of the national Franchised Dealers’ Association representing 4,000 official car dealers across the UK and part of the of the umbrella Retail Motor Industry Federation said: ’As half the UK’s car buyers are women, it is very important that we recognise that in the manufacturing and buying process.

‘Retailers are working very hard to  encourage more women into the  industry at all levels from senior management to technicians .’

‘Women are a powerful force in the car market and the industry has improved to and responded to this.’

More women need to be employed on the shop-floor - as well as the design and marketing departments - to make a real difference, said Dr Palmer

Ford is among those firms that does take women drivers seriously and has its own Women’s Product Panel to advise it.

Angela Engel, who chairs the Ford panel, said woman ask questions such as could a door handle be grabbed without a ring scratching the lacquer, will high heels mean knees hit steering wheels, and how easy is it to get in the car when wearing a tight skirt.

Renault’s customer knowledge department and General Motors’ interior design department are headed by women. Bentley’s engineers have designed ‘pearl pink’ and ‘dragon red’ options for China’s women.

The RAC’s technical director, David Bizley said a boom in women drivers over a quarter of a century - now accounting for nearly half - meant car-makers had to adapt.

Of the 27.8million drivers on UK roads in 1989, 11.1 million (40 per cent) were women, the remaining 16.7million (60 per cent) were men.

Today, of the 35.2million drivers, 16.3million (46.3 per cent) are women, compared to 18.9million (53.7 per cent) who are men.

Mr Bizley said: ‘Until comparatively recently there were always far more male than female drivers, which naturally caused a level of bias in terms of vehicle design. But those days have passed.’
