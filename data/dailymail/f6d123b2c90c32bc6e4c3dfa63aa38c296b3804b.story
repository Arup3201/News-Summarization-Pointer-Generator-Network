There is a new hot young thing taking the Championship by storm. Here Sportsmail tells you all you need to know about this exciting teenage talent.  

Who is this whippet winger at Birmingham I’m hearing about?

Demarai Gray is his name. His reputation has been bubbling away for a season or so but he announced himself to the Championship with a fine hat-trick against Reading in the 6-1 win at St Andrew’s.

Tell me more…

He has come through the same Birmingham youth system that produced Nathan Redmond, Jack Butland and Sone Aluko and was given his debut by Lee Clarke as a late sub in October 2013 aged 17 and 95 days.

He is blessed with frightening pace, an ability to dribble, and good technique, although before his recent goals he had scored only twice in 25 appearances (albeit mainly from the bench).

Who has he been compared to?

Redmond is the obvious example because of their Birmingham connection, but he shares a similar style and stature also to Raheem Sterling, admittedly with far to go before possibly reaching the Liverpool player’s level.

What’s his story?

Born in Birmingham, Gray attended Frankley High in the south of the city. His sugary touch found an adequate platform through Cadbury Athletic, a team connected to the Bournville-based chocolate factory. At 11 he was scouted by Birmingham and has been at their academy ever since.

He describes himself as ‘bubbly, calm and happy’ and says his perfect pre-match meal is egg and toast. Ravel Morrison has been his most skillful team-mate.

Talk me through this hat-trick…

It came in 34 first-half minutes. His first was a burst from central midfield to the edge of the area where he dispatched a low finish into the far corner. His second saw him race past two defenders to the right of the area and fire a shot back across goal sooner than keeper Adam Federici expected. His third was a cool finish from the left after arriving onto David Davis’s pass at full speed.

Is he attracting attention from bigger clubs?

Certainly, and manager Gary Rowett is braced for bids in January. Crystal Palace had a £500,000 bid rejected on transfer deadline day in the summer, an offer the club saw as vastly inferior to any they might countenance.

Liverpool, Tottenham, Arsenal and Newcastle have all also been linked with monitoring his situation.

Gray has 18 months left on his current deal but has been offered a two-year extension by Birmingham.
