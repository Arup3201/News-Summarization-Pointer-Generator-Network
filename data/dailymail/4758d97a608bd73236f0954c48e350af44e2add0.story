Jamie Carragher has slammed Arsenal's stars for their over-the-top celebrations following Sunday's win at Manchester City.

Aaron Ramsey posted a picture to his Instagram account of himself and Gunners team-mates Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Olivier Giroud and Per Mertesacker in good spirits in the changing room after the game.

The Welshman was not the only player to take to social media following the 2-0 victory at the Etihad, with Alexis Sanchez posing for a selfie with some of his pals on the journey home.

However, the move has clearly irked former Liverpool and England defender  Carragher, who believes Arsenal's celebrations should be put on hold - until they win some silverware.

Sportsmail's Carragher ironically posted his own selfie with fellow Sky Sports pundit Gary Neville after the show, but told Monday Night Football: 'It's winding me up - it's an absolute joke.

'It was one giant going to another giant. Of course celebrate, but it’s nonsense all of these team pics in dressing rooms - normally you have them with a cup! It’s nonsense and they need to stop doing it.'

Carragher did however pile praise on the Gunners for their disciplined display at the Etihad as goals from Santi Cazorla and Olivier Giroud earned the points.

He added: 'I was shocked Arsene Wenger went with those tactics. Besides Man City, it feels like the whole country is pleased Arsenal won that game in that manner.'

While the result was eye-catching, Arsenal remain fifth in the Barclays Premier League table, some eight points adrift of second-placed City and 13 behind leaders Chelsea.

Arsenal took the lead on 24 minutes when the excellent Cazorla converted a penalty won when Vincent Kompany tripped Nacho Monreal.

And the three points were guaranteed when Giroud headed home a Cazorla free-kick on 67 minutes.
