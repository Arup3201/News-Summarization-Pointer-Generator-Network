Hundreds of barges are today stranded by low water on the Mississippi River near Greenville, Mississippi, after the U.S. Coast Guard closed an 11-mile stretch of the drought-parched waterway for dredging and to replace missing navigation buoys.

The worst U.S. drought in 56 years has left the river there at its lowest point since 1988, a year when a similarly dire drought also stalled commercial traffic on the major shipping waterway.

A lack of rain in the area in recent months has reduced water levels, exposing sandbars that experts warn could be 
deadly quicksand.

Drought: Some lightly loaded river traffic, such as this set of barges and towboat near Greenville, is still able to move along the Mississippi River. However, 97 vessels were yesterday stranded by low water in the region

Unsafe: A lowering river allowssand bars to emerge in the Mississippi River near Greenville. Experts have warned that these could be deadly quicksand

The sandbars that are revealed look 
like beaches, inviting boaters, fishermen and hikers to venture out. Experts agree that can be a very bad idea.

Steve Barry, emergency management 
chief for the Corps of Engineers office in Memphis, Tennessee, said the 
exposed sand looks dry on top but it is really saturated mud.

Combined 
with the undercurrent of water in the fast-moving rivers, that creates a
true danger.

Mr Barry said: 'If it's 
really wet sand and there's flowing water underneath it, that's what 
quicksand is.

'The other issue is that as the river flows 
by it undercuts. You think you're on a sandbar but you're basically on a
ledge. You put enough weight on it and you end up in the river.'

Dredging operations near St Louis were
halting river traffic for 12 hours at a time on Monday as the U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers worked to keep a shipping lane wide enough and deep 
enough for commercial barge tows hauling everything from grain and 
fertiliser to steel and coal, industry sources said.

Shippers
have been told for weeks to limit the amount of cargo loaded onto 
barges by at least 30 per cent so that they sit higher on the water, and
to limit the number of barges in tows, but numerous vessels have still 
run aground up and down the river.

Vegetation accumulates in the sand bar in the middle of the Mississippi near Greenville. The worst drought in 56 years has left the river at its lowest point since 1988

At
least three vessels, all with lighter-loaded cargo, ran aground in 
recent days between Caruthersville, Missouri, and Memphis, Tennessee, 
the Coast Guard said.

The 
various river shipping restrictions have reduced the flow of goods to 
and from Gulf export terminals and driven up the cost of shipping as 
cargo volumes have declined but fuel and labour costs have not.

Some shipping lines have idled a portion of their barge fleets due to the currently unprofitable freight rates.

Jay O'Neil, senior agricultural economist at Kansas State University, 
said: 'All of the grain export houses are impacted by the closures on 
the river and, when the river is open, by the reduced drafts. It drives 
up the costs of delivering grain to the port and it makes logistics a 
bit of a nightmare.'

Barge 
freight rates were only marginally higher yesterday since only minimal 
volumes of grain were being shipped to Gulf export terminals.

But
the upcoming Midwest corn and soybean harvest could propel freight 
costs higher if river traffic remains severely restricted.

The
backup at Greenville included 57 southbound vessels and 40 northbound 
vessels as of Monday afternoon, said Coast Guard Petty Officer Ryan 
Tippets, adding that there was no timetable yet for reopening that 
stretch of the river.

He said: 'There's a Coast Guard cutter on scene surveying and remarking the channel (with navigation buoys) right now.'

The
river was closed on Friday, according to shipping industry sources, 
although navigation restrictions have been in place in the area since a 
vessel ran aground at the location on August 11.

Earlier this month, an 11-year-old 
girl had to be rescued after sand swallowed her up to her waist while 
she and her family fished along the Mississippi near New Madrid in 
southeast Missouri.

Firefighter Jim Russell said the girl began to sink 
and the more she struggled, the faster she descended.

Mr Russell
and another firefighter found a slab of concrete debris to stabilise 
themselves, then had to dig the girl out by hand. She was scared but 
unharmed.

He said: 'When you get to 
knee depth, you can't get out. It just starts sucking 
you down in it. It's really like heavy goo. It looks dry on top but 
really it's waterlogged.'

Lt
Ryan Gomez of the U.S. Coast Guard said the best suggestion is to stay 
off sandbars. Otherwise, he urged the use of lifejackets for anyone in 
or near the water.
