Everton fans may not have enjoyed their side's goalless draw against Swansea on Saturday, but they will be pleased to see Belgian star Kevin Mirallas recovering well from his injury. 

The former Olympiacos forward has been out since picking up a hamstring injury in the Merseyside derby in September, but he looked in rude health while training in the gym.

The 27-year-old posted the video of himself, and said: 'Training hard!!! Play hard!!! Back soon.'

The Belgian international's training regime consisted of jogging in the gym while fighting against the pull of an elasticated waistband.

Everton have struggled without Mirallas. Roberto Martinez's side are eight in the Premier League with just three wins from their 10 games.

The Blues missed the opportunity the move ahead of rivals Liverpool on Saturday after Brendan Rodgers' side lost 1-0 to Newcastle.

Next up for Everton is a Europa League clash with French side Lille.

After Everton's 0-0 draw with Swansea, the club's supporters will hope to see him sooner rather than later

Mirallas injured his hamstring in the Merseyside derby back in September and hasn't featured since
