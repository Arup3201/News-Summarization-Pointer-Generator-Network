The odd job man, known locally as 'Jersey' was arrested on unrelated charges and is now being questioned as to Baby Lisa's whereabouts, NBC station

when he got home from work, however, the baby was gone, and she was 
reported missing by her parents early on Tuesday.

crept into their home while the child's mother and brothers slept and 
snatched the baby girl, saying that the front window had been tampered 
with.

consultant for television networks, said that the reward to help find 
her was coming from anonymous sources.

general public has access to’.
