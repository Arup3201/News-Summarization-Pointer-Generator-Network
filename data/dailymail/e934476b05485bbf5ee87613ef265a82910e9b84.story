The woman, known as S, claims she was subjected to violence and pressure to marry and was told by her mother she would be beheaded if she went to the authorities for help as she did in 2005 (File picture)

A couple threatened to kill their daughter if she rejected a forced marriage and behead her if she contacted authorities for help.

A judge has since granted a temporary forced marriage protection order, banning the parents from leaving Britain, after the local authority in Croydon, London, said it 'did not trust them an inch' and feared younger children in the family would be spirited out of England if they were able to leave.   

The girl, known as S, claims she suffered repeated violence at the hands of her parents and grandmother as a teenager and was told she would be killed if she refused to marry abroad as this would 'bring dishonour on the family.

She described a long history of being put under pressure to marry, and when she spoke to authorities in 2005 about suffering 'violence and intimidation' from her family she claimed her mother said her father would 'cut her head off' if she ever raised issues again.

During a hearing at the Family Division of the High Court, Mr Justice Holman granted a temporary forced marriage protection order until next month. 

This prevents the family from leaving Britain after it emerged that the mother wanted to go to Afghanistan. 

Mr Justice Holman granted the order on the basis that Croydon County Council, which made the application, 'did not trust this family an inch' and feared three younger children in the family could be 'spirited out of Britain.' 

The High Court heard that S, who cannot be identified, had described suffering a long history of pressure to accept a forced marriage.

The family, who are originally from Afghanistan, lived for a considerable time in Norway. 

During their time in Norway S, now 22, was referred to the local authority by her school health service because of concerns about her welfare.

Mr Justice Holman made the order at a hearing at the High Court in London, part of the Royal Courts of Justice 

Mr Justice Holman said a written decision from a public body or court in Norway, dated 2008, explained that the girl had been subjected to pressure to go to Afghanistan to marry. The plan had been that the family would go for a 14 day holiday but S would remain for six months to get married.

A report of the 2008 proceedings said: 'The girl talks about violence against her from the family, mother, father, brother and grandmother. This has increased during the past month and has been happening on a daily basis.

'The girl said that her parents told her she would be killed if she would not travel, because this would bring dishonour to her family.'

Mr Justice Holman granted a forced marriage protection order, until a further hearing in December

The court heard that this document also mentioned an incident after she had contact with the local authorities about death threats, intimidation and violence from her family in 2005. They were also claims the family was monitoring her. 

It added: 'The girl said after the emergency placement in 2005, the mother repeatedly told her that if S could contact the authorities again, her father will 'Take the girl and cut off her head.'

The family had their passports seized in April this year by police because of fears "criminal offences may have been, or were planned to be, committed upon" the children.

Mr Justice Holman added: 'The local authority very strongly resists that, for they do not, frankly, trust this family an inch.

'They consider that if any parent is allowed out of England and Wales, there is a real risk that, by some means or another, these children will be spirited out of England and Wales.'

The court heard that S was planning to get married in Afghanistan, by her own choice, this October and had wanted her mother and youngest brother to travel to be at her wedding.

Croydon County Council applied for a forced marriage protection order to prevent the family travelling abroad. 

This was granted on a temporary basis, until a full hearing on December 20. 

The penalty for breaking a forced marriage protection order is five years in prison, and parents who force their children to marry can be jailed for seven years.
