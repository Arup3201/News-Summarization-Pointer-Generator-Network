It didn't get him tossed out of the game like a flagrant 2 foul would have, but Brooklyn Nets center Mason Plumlee committed the mother of all party fouls on Saturday night in Washington D.C. 

During his team's 114-77 loss to the Washington Wizards at the Verizon Center, the 6' 10' Plumlee, 24, barreled into courtside waitress Deila Barr while he was chasing down a loose ball.

The collision sent the tray of drinks Barr was holding flying and left her drenched in beer and booze.

Brooklyn Nets center Mason Plumlee bumped into courtside waitress Deila Barr at the Verizon Center in D.C. 

Barr, 26, became the center of attention after the crash with Plumlee and was featured on ESPN's Sportcenter

The waitress said she thinks her tray contained four Bud Lights, a winter ale, a gin and tonic and a Chardonnay

The soaked server, who did her best to hold on to the tray, said she thinks she was carrying four Bud Lights, a winter ale, a gin and tonic and a Chardonnay, the Washington Post reported. 

Barr, 26, said: 'I just kind of see a ball coming towards me, and you can see me kind of kicking it out of the way so I don't trip.

'Then all of a sudden, I just see this giant white mass coming toward me.'

After the collision, the game was stopped for a number of minutes so the mess could be cleaned up and the ball could be dried off. 

Fans who got soaked were given bags of Wizards swag and Barr got a new shirt to replace the one she was wearing. 

Spectator Scott Jenkins said: 'They brought me a bunch of shirts. 

'They took care of me. The Wizards did it right.'

Jenkins added he smelled like 'lite' beer that he hadn't ordered.

Barr was left drenched and her tray was nearly empty after the crash (left). The ball (right) was soaked as well

Barr has been a courtside server for almost 18 months and also works at the US House of Representatives 

Barr, a former college athlete played softball and field hockey at Division III Drew University, mostly roots for Philadelphia teams.

Based on the way Plumlee acted after the accident, Barr won't be switching her allegiance to Brooklyn or Duke University anytime soon. 

She said: 'He kind of was a little brat about it; he threw his arms up in the air and stormed off. 

'I'm sorry. I didn't know that impacted your life so much. 

'But he played at Duke, so what do you expect?'

Barr began working on the Small Business Committee at the US House of Representatives last month, according to her LinkedIn page. 

She has been a courtside server for Levy Restaurants for almost 18 months. 

During her time working at Washington Wizards games, Barr has 'initiated and maintained relationships with season ticket holders to enhance their experience.'

Thanks to Plumlee, that experience enhancement now includes being doused with beer.
