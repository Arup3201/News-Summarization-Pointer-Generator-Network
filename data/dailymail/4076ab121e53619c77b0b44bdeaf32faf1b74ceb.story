A ‘political storm’ is brewing over a rising tide of sex offending and domestic violence in the Armed Forces, top brass have been warned.

The alarm is raised in a confidential  email, seen by The Mail on Sunday, from the Forces’ most senior lawyer in which he asks for a meeting with one of the Army’s top generals to discuss the problem.

In the email, Bruce Houlder QC, head of the Service Prosecuting Authority, says he wants a meeting with Lieutenant General Gerald Berragan, the adjutant general and the officer with overall responsibility for Army discipline.

Mr Houlder says he wants to discuss how the Services’ justice system deals with domestic violence and sexual offending and advises that he considers the issues represent ‘future political storms’.

The email was leaked to The Mail  on Sunday last week after Ministry of Defence figures revealed during a debate in Parliament last month indicated that there have been 39 cases of alleged rape and 129 cases of alleged sexual assault of female members of the Armed Forces since 2009.

The records also show that more than 20 soldiers placed on the sex offenders register continue to serve.

A separate report after a survey  of 6,000 Army personnel stated  that every one of the 400 female soldiers spoken to claimed to have been the subject of unwanted sexual attention.

One of the most high-profile cases  to reach disciplinary stage involved Corporal Anne-Marie Ellement, 30, a Royal Military Police officer who hanged herself in 2011 outside her barracks after her complaint of rape against two fellow Redcaps was dismissed by an RMP inquiry.

Another study, of 14,000 servicemen who had returned from combat, showed that one in eight had committed a violent act, a significant proportion of which were related to domestic violence.

Recently former Royal Engineer Lewis Mackay described in graphic detail the kind of problems experienced by soldiers returning home from a tour of duty. He says that many soldiers who attack their partners are suffering from post-traumatic stress.

Mr Mackay saw a search team commander lose both legs when he stepped on a home-made bomb in Afghanistan.

He said that when he went home to his wife, Emma, he came close to hitting her. ‘I had a very short temper, I was punching doors and walls. I was very, very aggressive,’ he said.

‘If
Emma was doing something that I didn’t think was right, I wanted to 
lash out. I had to try my hardest not to – by sitting on my hands or 
biting my fist.’

Service charities such as the  Army 
Families Federation (AFF) and the Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Families
Association (SSAFA), believe that domestic violence is a far bigger 
issue within the military than the MoD is prepared to accept.

Catherine
Spencer, the chief executive of the AFF, said: ‘AFF believes that 
domestic violence is taken seriously by the Army but there is a concern 
that the victim may perceive that there is more reason to conceal it due
to the effect on the soldier’s career and potential loss of service 
family accommodation.’

An MoD spokesman said: ‘The Armed Forces have a zero-tolerance approach to all forms of bullying, discrimination and abuse. 

‘All
allegations will be thoroughly investigated, either by the civil or 
military police and, where appropriate, action will be taken.’
