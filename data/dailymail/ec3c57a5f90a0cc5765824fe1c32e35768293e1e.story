Wealthy ‘ladies who lunch’ in Britain’s most prosperous areas drink more alcohol than any other social group, research has found.

Women in Knightsbridge and Hampstead in London, Esher in Surrey and Merchiston in Edinburgh are twice as likely as average to exceed a recommended limit of three units a day.

Two-thirds (66 per cent) of women in such areas – where  multi-million-pound homes and six-figure salaries are common – drink more than the limit, compared with 28.9 per cent nationally.

Nearly two-thirds of women in rich areas drink more than three units of alcohol a day 

Women in wealthy areas such as London's Knightsbridge are also more likely to suffer from mental health problems

Experts warned the figures add to growing fears of a ‘silent epidemic’ of middle-class drinking.

Men and women in these areas were 
twice as likely to suffer from anxiety or nerves, at 6.5 per cent rather
than 2.9 per cent nationally.

The study identified a ‘footballers’ 
wives’ effect in areas such as Totteridge, north London, Heswall in the 
Wirral and Hale Barns in Altrincham, all of which are known to attract 
wealthy footballers.

While men were slightly more likely to drink too much, women were much more affected, with four in ten over-indulging.

Patrick Tate of CACI, which wrote the 
report, said: ‘Women in these areas have lavish lifestyles, but without 
the need to work, and are extremely socially active.

'It is the classic 
group of ladies who lunch.’

Lyn Brierley-Jones, research  fellow 
at the University of Sunderland’s department of pharmacy, health and 
wellbeing, said affluent drinkers could conceal problems.

She said: ‘Middle-class drinkers may 
be disadvantaged by their advantage – in other words, aspects of their 
lifestyle known to promote health, such as low-fat diets and exercise, 
mask symptoms related to alcohol problems.

'Our research shows a common 
perception among some middle-class groups that regularly drinking at 
home, particularly wine, is safe and sensible.

‘Evidence suggests such regular drinking will lead to significant health problems later in life.’

The Government advises men not to 
regularly exceed 3-4 units of alcohol per day (equivalent to a pint and a
half of 4 per cent beer), or 2-3 units of alcohol for women (one 175ml 
glass of wine).

Research suggests middle-class professionals drink more as a way of coping with stress.

They regard a glass or two of wine or the odd tipple as a necessary ‘reward’ after a long day at work or looking after children.

But many are oblivious to how small, regular amounts can cause long-term problems including liver damage and certain cancers.

Women in wealthy areas who drink above the daily limit

Earlier this year, the British Liver 
Trust warned that rising numbers of ‘everyday drinkers’ – including 
middle-class adults – were being admitted to hospital with 
alcohol-related illness.

Charity 4Children last year said that 
parents need to be warned about how drinking can affect their parenting 
in the same way that mothers are advised about the impact of alcohol 
during pregnancy and breastfeeding.

Chief executive Anne Longfield said: 
‘Drinking can seriously dent people’s judgement and the way they engage 
with their children.’

 A £25million programme is to tackle alcohol misuse among older people.

In
the past five years, drink-related hospital admissions for the over-65s
have increased by 62 per cent, more than the number of cases in 16 to 
24-year-olds.

Those 
aged 55 to 74 have the highest number of deaths linked to alcohol. The 
over-65s drink for six or seven days a week, more than any other age 
group.

Reactions to alcohol get slower and the liver less efficient at breaking down alcohol with age.

Peter Ainsworth of the Big Lottery Fund told the Observer: 'Most older people drink moderately.

'[But]
a silent story is evolving among older people as they experience 
life-changing events such as retirement, redundancy or bereavement.'

One
woman, 72-year-old Ann, told the paper: 'We always enjoyed nice wine, 
and when the girls moved on we'd open a bottle most evenings.'

She said her husband's death, where she was too drunk to understand what she was being told, prompted her to get help.

The Big Lottery Fund is investing in the Rethink Good Health programme to set up 15 to 20 centres across the UK.

A
recent report by the Royal College of Psychiatrists said that about a 
third of elderly people with drink problems did not abuse alcohol when 
they were younger.
