Argentina has condemned the British government’s new military exercises in the Falkland Islands as Baroness Thatcher was today laid to rest.

As more than 250,000 lined the streets of London, clapping and cheering as Lady Thatcher's coffin processed through London, it was revealed Buenos Aires has filed a complaint with the United Nations, the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) and the Mercosur.

It has moved to denounce the drills, launched on April 15 and due to continue until April 26, as a 'new act of provocation'.

Argentina has condemned the British government's new military exercises in the Falkland Islands as Baroness Thatcher was today laid to rest

In a statement it said: 'Argentina's Foreign Ministry has found out that the British government plans to carry out new military exercises from April 15 to 26 in occupied Argentinean territory, including missile launches from the Malvinas Islands, Press TV reports.

'[The drills] are a new show of contempt from Britain for the resolutions of the United Nations, which call for both sides to resume negotiations on sovereignty and to abstain from introducing unilateral changes to the situation as long as the dispute continues, as well as a new provocation against Argentina.'

It also accused Britain of  justifying its presence on the islands 'only through military might'.

In January British military chiefs vowed a 'show of force' on the islands to warn Argentina against attacking the territory.

President Cristina Kirchner was not invited, but, in keeping with diplomatic protocol, an invitation was sent to the Argentine Ambassador to the UK, Alicia Castro, who declined

It was said at the time, it could include the deployment of additional troops, warships and extra Typhoon fighter jets to the region.

There was talk also of another high-profile military campaign.

There was no official representative from Argentina at the funeral of Baroness Thatcher.

President Cristina Kirchner was not invited, but, in keeping with diplomatic protocol, an invitation was sent to the Argentine Ambassador to the UK, Alicia Castro, who declined.

More than 700 armed forces personnel from units that served in the 1982 Falklands War against Argentina - Thatcher's most emblematic victory - lined the streets.

Police also stood all along the route.

Relations have been strained since the 1982 war, when Thatcher ordered a task force to retake the South Atlantic territory after Argentinian troops seized it.

The U.N. Security Council has paid tribute to the late Prime Minister .

Rwandan Foreign Minister Louise Mushikiwabo, whose country holds the council presidency, expressed 'deepest sympathy' to Thatcher's family and the people of the United Kingdom on behalf of the council. 

But only 14 of the 15 council members rose in tribute, along with Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and others, because Argentina's seat was empty.

Thatcher, whose funeral was Wednesday, sent British troops to retake the Falkland Islands in 1982 after Argentina invaded. 

Immediately afterwards, Argentina's U.N. Ambassador Maria Cristina Perceval returned to her seat to hear Mushikiwabo express the council's 'deepest sympathy for the Boston senseless killings.'
