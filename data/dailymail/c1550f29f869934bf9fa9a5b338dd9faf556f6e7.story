Ready to score: Judith Weir is in the running to be the new Master Of The Queen's Music

For almost 400 years, it is a role that has been filled by celebrated male composers, including Sir Edward Elgar and most recently Sir Peter Maxwell Davies, but now the Queen could have made a radical new departure.

I hear that the new Master Of The Queen’s Music has been chosen — and it is likely to be a woman.

‘The name will be announced next month,’ says my man at the Palace. ‘The word is that it will be the first Mistress Of The Queen’s Music.’

One of the most likely candidates to succeed Sir Peter is Judith Weir, who was awarded the Queen’s Medal for Music in 2007.

The 60-year-old Cambridge graduate trained with the late Sir John Tavener, whose Song For Athene was performed at Princess Diana’s funeral, and is best known for her operas, such as The Vanishing Bridegroom.

It would not be the first time that the Queen has broken tradition by appointing a woman to an artistic role. In 2009, Carol Ann Duffy became the first female Poet Laureate.

However, the Gorbals-born versifier has done little to endear herself to the monarch. The role involves writing poems for important royal occasions, but Duffy, whose predecessors include Ted Hughes and Sir John Betjeman, has yet to compose an ode to mark the birth of Prince George.

Another possible candidate for Mistress Of The Queen’s Music is Sally Beamish, 57, whose work spans film and TV to pieces for the BBC Proms.

Establishment rivals for the post include Michael Berkeley, a godson of Benjamin Britten, who was elevated to the Lords as a crossbencher last year, and John Rutter, the composer of an anthem for Prince William and Kate Middleton’s wedding in 2011.

Traditionally, the Master Of The Queen’s Music, who is expected to compose tunes to commemorate important royal events, holds the post for life. However, Sir Peter, who has been treated for leukaemia, accepted it for just ten years. The 79-year-old composer, completed that term in March, but agreed to continue until a successor was found.

A Palace spokesman says an announcement about the post, for which the holder is paid an honorary stipend, will be made in ‘due course’.

Rushing, arms outstretched, Prince Harry’s ex, Cressida Bonas, gave her old Stowe headmaster Anthony Wallersteiner a big hug at a gala in aid of Children In Crisis. Dr Wallersteiner, who was on the gala committee, tells me: ‘She called me “Headmaster” and said she was pursuing her career as an actress, having been inspired by our head of drama, Nick Bayley. ‘When Cressida came to Stowe last summer, she was desperate to find Nick to thank him in person. We spent about 20 minutes after the concert looking for him.’

Having won over the British Royal Family — the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge revealed they are ‘huge fans’ of the show — Downton Abbey has set its sights on royals abroad.

Yesterday, Downton stars Joanne Froggatt, Sophie McShera and Lesley Nicol posed with Prince Albert of Monaco (right) at the 54th Monte Carlo Television Festival.

Let’s hope the Prince, 56, who has announced he and his wife, Princess Charlene, are expecting their first child, will look upon Downton more kindly than he did Grace Of Monaco — the Nicole Kidman biopic about his mother Grace Kelly, which last month he described as ‘a farce’.

Michelin-starred restaurant River 
Cafe, which counts Jamie Oliver among its past chefs, is on the move. It
 is to be relocated once the proposed redevelopment of its site at 
Thames Wharf begins next year.

Opened in 1987 by Ruth Rogers and the 
late chef Rose Gray as a cafe for the employees of the architectural 
partnership founded by Ruth’s husband Richard Rogers, it also served as 
the unofficial canteen for New Labour.

The River Cafe even hand-delivered a picnic to Downing Street on Tony Blair’s first day in office.

Ruth suggests the cafe’s move might be
 permanent. She tells me: ‘We are going to have to move temporarily then
 come back — or find another place.’

Barely out of the womb, the newest member of the Delevingne clan is already gracing social media.

Elder sister of models Poppy and Cara Delevingne, Chloe and her property developer husband Edward Grant welcomed baby Atticus on Tuesday. 

After an 18-hour labour, Atticus was ready for his close-up, which Grant, Chloe’s second husband, immediately posted online.

Edward and a five-months pregnant Chloe, 29, wed earlier this year after a four-year courtship.

Chloe’s first marriage in 2007, to Ed’s friend, nightclub impresario Louis Buckworth, ended after a mere 17 months.

Last week, the couple were preparing for the baby’s arrival by publicly gushing about their ‘new set of wheels’ from a well-known pram company.

Given the Delevingneses’ predilection for social media — even Cara’s pet rabbit Cecil has his own account — it can be only a matter of time before Atticus is snapping ‘selfies’.

Bidders at charity auctions are a 
competitive bunch. But bidding against yourself, however worthy the 
cause, is surely above and beyond.

Not for Lady Dannatt, wife of the 
former head of the Army, General Lord Dannatt, at the Street Child 
summer party in the Tower of London where he is Constable.

The lot in question was a  
behind-the-scenes tour of TV’s The Apprentice show conducted by Nick 
Hewer, the man Lord Sugar calls his ‘eyes and ears’.

When the bidding reached £1,300, Lady 
D. bid £1,400, £1,500 and £1,600 in quick succession. It eventually  
went for £2,000 to a rival bidder.

Lovejoy would have been proud.

As Sir Mick Jagger consoles himself in the arms of a younger woman following the death of his partner L’Wren Scott, his first wife, Bianca Jagger, was caught napping on the London Underground during rush hour on Tuesday clutching a walking stick.

The 69-year-old Nicaraguan-born former model turned human rights activist, who filed for divorce from Sir Mick on the grounds of his adultery with Jerry Hall, became a great-grandmother last month when her granddaughter Assisi (daughter of Mick and Bianca’s daughter Jade) gave birth to a girl.

And Bianca is to become a granny again when Jade gives birth to her third child this month. No wonder she needs some shut-eye.

Mad days at The Oldie mag, where 
Alexander Chancellor, 74, was introduced to staff yesterday as a hip 
replacement for 76-year-old ex-editor Richard Ingrams. ‘It’s like a 
vipers’ nest in here,’ says an old timer. ‘Chancellor seems completely 
past it, far more doddery than Richard.’  Ingrams is giving a lunch 
today at Soho’s Gay Hussar for his roll of honour — contributors who 
have resigned in protest at his departure. ‘Alexander told me he 
wouldn’t take the job, but now he says he’s “very, very broke”,’ says 
Ingrams. ‘So the bank manager has spoken.’

Keira Knightley famously once declared ‘I don’t have t**s’, but yesterday the slender actress was happy to disprove her statement as she went bra-less underneath a red cardigan while meeting a friend in West London.

The 29-year-old, who wed Klaxons singer James Righton in a low-key ceremony last year, has been vocal about her displeasure with producers enhancing her embonpoint in pictures.

‘They always pencil in my boobs,’ Keira once remarked when asked about the posters for the 2004 flop King Arthur, in which her bust was digitally altered.

However, she is less concerned about the size of her bosom than its direction, saying: ‘If you’re going to make me fantasy breasts, at least make perky breasts.’
