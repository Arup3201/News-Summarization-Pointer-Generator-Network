Lindsay Nichols was shot dead by her ex boyfriend after they broke up

A horrific murder suicide has left a town in shock after a doctor, 44, shot dead his ex-girlfriend, 22, before turning the gun on himself after she revealed on Facebook she had a new boyfriend.

Dr Timothy Roses, a radiologist from Waterloo, Iowa, 
fatally shot Lindsay Nichols, of Evansdale, Iowa, in the chest before 
also shooting himself in the chest around 9pm on Wednesday night.

They were found near an intersection in Jesup, where her new boyfriend lived. Roses was already dead and Lindsay died later in hospital.

The pair were known to be in a relationship but it ended earlier this year.

Friends say Lindsay was concerned about his behaviour since the breakup.

Early on Wednesday, the pretty 22-year-old changed her relationship status to reveal she was in a new relationship with Chase Weber.

Hours later, she was dead.

According to KWWL, Roses followed Lindsay to her new boyfriend's home and shot her in the driveway when she wouldn't get into his car.

Her boyfriend saw the whole thing and called 911.

Lindsay was studying radiology at Covenant Medical Center in Waterloo, which is where she met Roses, according to her uncle.

She was preparing to take her Iowa State Radiology Boards and, according to her family, wanted to make a difference in the lives of others.

Postings on Facebook show that Roses became obsessed with the petite blonde after they broke up.

She updated her status last month to reveal she had broken up with her boyfriend and that he was contacting her friends, trying to find out where she was and who she was with.

On February 3 she posted: 'An invasion of privacy, it needs to stop.'

Later that day she wrote: 'I
 really don't think I should ever feel unsafe because I feel as if I'm 
being watched.'

Friends urged her to take action against him or go to the police. But she never did.

According to recent appraisal district records, Roses lived in Rockwall with his wife and children.

Kevin Brown, who lives across the street from the shooting scene, said he heard three shots about 9pm on Wednesday.

Chase Weber is listed on Lindsay's Facebook page as her new boyfriend, which sparked off Roses to kill her

'Boom, boom, and then three seconds 
later maybe another one,' he told the DesMoines Register.

He added they 
were told a man had killed his ex-girlfriend.

Evansdale Mayor Chad Deutsch said the Nichols family is well-known in 
the community.

Lindsay's father is the city's parks commissioner
 as well as a Black Hawk County sheriff’s deputy.

Her late grandfather 
was also a mayor of the town.

She was an honors student and 2008 graduate of Waterloo East High School where she was a cheerleader and also on the volleyball and softball teams.

The
 devastated town of Evansdale held a candlelit vigil on Thursday night 
for Lindsay, with more than 300 people gathering on the steps of 
Waterloo's East High.

Her family and friends reflected on and celebrated the life of a young woman they so dearly loved and would sorely miss.

Forever Young, Let It Be and Only The Good Die Young were all played at her vigil.

Tears of sorrow: Friends of Lindsay could not contain their emotion at her candlelit vigil on Thursday night

Remembrance: More than 300 people came to pay their respects for the 22-year-old and support her heartbroken family at this tragic time

Many could not contain their emotions and expressed shock that such a tragedy could have happened.

Lindsay's close friend Abby Lundy told KWWL: 'I don't think I honestly realize that it's happened yet. I
 think I'm kind of going through the motions to be strong for the 
situation. It's going to affect me for the rest of my life.'

Another friend Kylie Smedley said: 'We're never going to forget her, ever. We'll 
never forget her personality, her face, her attitude towards life, 
ever. She was just an awesome person.'

Former East High teacher Mike 
Allen asked the crowd to support the Nichols family in this tragic time and for members of the close-knit community to look out for each other.

He told the crowd: 'We shouldn’t be here on these stairs for this young lady. For those of you who know how strong Lindsay was and is ... what you have done here tonight, in regards to how organized Lindsay’s life was, is a compliment.'
