Halloween came early for New Yorkers as Banksy unveiled his latest piece in the final few days of a month-long exhibition.

The installation launched at 7pm last night features a grim reaper carting around manically on a bumper car.

Police arrived to the scene at the corner of Houston and Elizabeth Streets but did not break up the large crowds that gathered.

Art: A Grim Reaper figure, riding a bumper car, is the newest art installation by Banksy in New York

Excitement: Crowds build around the  piece that launched at dusk last night on Houston and Elizabeth Streets

The spooky figure looks ecstatic zooming along to Blue Öyster Cult's 'Don't Fear the Reaper'.

The installation is narrated by an audio guide with a lisping voice speaking over an accordion: 'Welcome to the fair, which life isn't.

'This sculpture perfectly represents death in that—it's a bit random.

'It often said that the role of art is to remind us of our mortality.

Watch the installation:

Banksy started his career on Bristol's underground street art scene in the early 1990s.

He used some stencils but did a lot of freehand work too - and started officially specialising in stencils in 2000.

By the mid-90s, his humourous and cutting pieces were popping up in London.

Becoming highly sought after pieces of art, his work was soon being auctioned off by art houses, who would leave the question of its removal to the bidder.

Now a typical artist name for coffee table books, he has still managed to maintain his anonymity.

Rumours circulate about his background, but the widely accepted story is that he was born and raised in Bristol, the son of a technician, and trained as a butcher.

He has now done pieces worldwide - from New Orleans in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina to a fully-fledged gallery exhibition in his home town.

'Banksy's take on that seems to be mounting an art show that goes on for so long, we all wish we were dead already.'

It follows the appearance of a graffiti of a man in a tuxedo solemnly holding a bunch of drooping flowers - as though he's just been stood up - on the side of a strip club on 51st Street.

The Hustler Club owners quickly enlisted the help of their security guard Jesse Wright to protect the piece while they determine how best to preserve it.

According to the Gothamist, Wright has been letting Banksy fans pose with the piece 'if (they) ask him nicely.'

Today, is the 24th day of the British street artist's month-long open-air residency in New York City, Better Out Than In. There are only 7 days left.

The Hustler Club's New York Marketing Director, Steve Karel, told Gothamist this afternoon: 'We're honored that Banksy chose the Larry Flynt's Hustler Club New York to share his art.

'We respect the art and artist; while we'd love to leave the work in place, it's required we lift the gate when we open for business, so after the public has the day to enjoy it, we will remove the door to keep it safe from vandals until we determine where it can be displayed in the future—hopefully inside of the club.'

Bansky revealed NYPD officers aching to catch him had halted his activity for at least one day.

The world-renowned street artist cancelled Wednesday's artwork after New York officials urged people to file complaints against the London-based man of mystery and boosted NYPD patrols looking for graffiti.

The announcement was made late Wednesday morning on his website: 'Today's art has been cancelled due to police activity.'

In Greenwich Village, two Banksy works, 'Sirens of the Lambs' and 'Shoe Shining Ronald McDonald' made a rare appearance together outside a McDonald's

On Saturday, Banksy painted a picture of a boy about to smash a water sprinkler with a hammer, titled 'Better Out Than In', on the Upper West Side. Saul Zabar, of the famed grocery store family, has helped add protective Plexiglass, to preserve the artist's work on his family's building on West 79th St
