Borussia Dortmund have accepted Bastian Schweinsteiger's apology for chanting a rude song about the club - and have offered to arrange singing lessons for the German midfielder.

The Bayern Munich star led an anti-chant about their fierce rivals where he was recorded singing: 'BVB, sons of b******s' at a party.

The 29-year-old later released an apology from his official Facebook page after the video went viral.

Dortmund's response read: ‘It is absolutely no problem that you drink a few beers, let off some steam and sing a song without really thinking it through after winning the World Cup.

‘We have always seen you as a fair guy. We would never have kicked up a fuss over your chants and we obviously accept your video apology. We wish you a pleasant holiday in Croatia.

'P.S. It is possible for you to get your singing right. If you need any singing lessons, just let us know. We are happy to help you out.’

Schweinsteiger, who helped Germany beat Argentina in the World Cup final earlier this month, had earlier said: 'Hello, I'm sending you all a message from my holidays, as it's come to my attention that a video of me has found its way onto the internet,' Germany's World Cup winner said.

'I'd like to say sorry to all fans, players and officials at Borussia Dortmund.

'I won't try to play this down - it's obviously a well known fan song, but I didn't want to insult anyone with the offensive word.

'It's important for me to articulate that now. I get on with all Dortmund players really well, especially Kevin Grosskreutz.

'It was an unhappy situation, so sorry again to all Dortmunders, I hope the fans will understand it. All the best, I hope everything's ok again. Your Basti.'

Despite the apology, the video of Schweinsteiger's anti-Dortmund chant should only serve to intensify the rivalry between the clubs, who have shared the last five Bundesliga titles between them.

They meet in the German Super Cup on August 13.

Mr Munich: Schweinsteiger will join up with his Bayern team-mates ahead of their summer tour

Schweinsteiger has been granted extended leave following his World Cup exertions but will head to New York with the rest of the squad for Bayern's summer tour at the end of July.

Bayern will stage a public practice session at the Red Bull Arena before taking on Mexican side Chivas on July 30 and finishing with a game against a team of MLS All-Stars on August 6.

Schweinsteiger will be joined by fellow World Cup winners including Manuel Neuer, Philipp Lahm and Mario Gotze in the States - while star midfielders Arjen Robben, Franck Ribery and new signing Robert Lewandowski are also expected to feature.
