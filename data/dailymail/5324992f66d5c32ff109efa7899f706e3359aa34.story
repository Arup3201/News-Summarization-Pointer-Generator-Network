An executive headteacher of a primary academy took home a salary in excess of £200,000 last year after being handed a massive pay rise meaning he now earns more than the Prime Minister, official accounts show.

Sir Greg Martin, executive head of Durand Academy in Stockwell, south London, saw his salary rise by around 56 per cent in 2013 to a total of £200,822 – thanks to a loophole which allows the salary increase due to the fact he runs several schools.

In addition to his salary, Mr Martin, who was knighted in last year's birthday honours for services to education, also received £28,316 in pension contributions last year.

Combined with his salary, this took his overall remuneration package for 2013 to £229,138.

In comparison, David Cameron earns around £142,500.

Durand Academy – a state run publicly-funded school – said Mr Martin’s role as executive head was ‘hugely demanding’ and said governors were ‘privileged to retain his services’.

However, the National Union of Teachers said it was ‘remarkably hard’ to see how the 56.5 per cent pay rise could be justified.

Durand Academy is a state academy - a school that is not under local council control and has freedom over areas such as curriculum and staff pay - and is run by the Durand Academy Trust.

It was judged to be good by Ofsted following an inspection in December.

Education Secretary Michael Gove, pictured, has previously visited Durand Academy School in Stockwell, south London, which was judged to be good by Ofsted following an inspection in December

It caters for five-to-11-year-olds, has a middle school for 12-to-13-year-olds and an early-years centre for under-fives.

The school is currently attempting to set up a state secondary boarding school for 13-to-18-year-olds in West Sussex.

Figures included in the Trust's annual accounts for 2013 show that Mr Martin’s salary rose 56.5 per cent from £128,322 in 2012.

The document also shows that Nathalie Parker, the academy's acting headteacher, was given a salary of between £115,000 and £120,000 last year.

Data published by the Department for Education last month shows that the average salary for a leadership teacher in a primary academy stands at £53,000.

A Durand Academy spokesman said: ‘Durand's Executive Head does not just run a primary school, but now oversees an Early Years school, a Junior School, a Middle School which opened in September 2012 and also leads the development of Durand's pioneering plans for a state boarding school for its intake in West Sussex.

Figures included in Durand Academy Trust's annual accounts for 2013 show that Mr Martin’s salary rose 56.5 per cent to £200,822 in 2013. In comparison, Prime Minister David Cameron, right, earns around £142,500

‘With more than 1,000 children being educated across three school sites, it is a hugely demanding role and Governors are proud and privileged to retain the services of such an experienced and dedicated education leader.

‘Children's outstanding attainment in this year's SATs is testament to his enduring positive impact.’

However, Christine Blower, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers (NUT) said: ‘It is remarkably hard to see how this can possibly be justified in a publicly funded school when those employed in the public sector are still restricted to a 1 per cent pay rise.’
