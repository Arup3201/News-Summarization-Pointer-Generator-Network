A teenager who has been in a coma for almost a year after she was accidentally shot in the head will be wheeled into court to face the man alleged to have almost killed her.

Despite not being able to hear or see any of the trial, the parents of 15-year-old Danielle Sampson, from Florida, want to take her to court so the man accused of her attempted murder to see her face-to-face.

They want Tyrone Mosby, who is alleged to have fired the shot that struck the pretty teenager, to 'see what he's done', and will take her in to an Orlando courtroom in a wheelchair, according to the family's legal team.

Her parents Alma and Justin also hope the unusual court appearance will serve as a poignant reminder to others of the innocent victims who suffer as a result of gun violence.

Court officials have already agreed to the request for the comatose patient to be present.

Danielle was leaving a church with her family in Pine Hills, Florida, last July when she was reportedly hit by a stray bullet in the head.

Two men were involved in a gunfight, it is believed, when the bullet struck Danielle as she was driven home with her family.

At the time, police said two shooters in two passing vehicles were firing at each other in the middle of the road, Daily News reports.

Danielle’s father, who was driving, heard gunshots and tried to take a turn to get out of the way.

But a bullet shattered the back windshield and the girl’s mother turned around to see her daughter slumped over in the backseat, News 13 reports.

She has remained in coma since being shot and now receives round the clock care at a rehabilitation centre.

Mosby was arrested a month after the shooting. He has pleaded not guilty to two attempted murder charges.

Mosby has an arrest record dating to September 2006, when he was 14, that includes several violent crime and drug charges, including possession of cocaine with intent to sell.

Last year he was acquitted of attempted first-degree murder, armed robbery, aggravated battery and aggravated assault after being charged at age 17 as an adult. 

He was acquitted again in February of attempted first-degree murder, aggravated battery and aggravated assault.

He pleaded no contest in 2010 to battery on a detention-facility staffer.  Mosby faces life in prison with no parole if found guilty.

Jury selection began on Monday.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
