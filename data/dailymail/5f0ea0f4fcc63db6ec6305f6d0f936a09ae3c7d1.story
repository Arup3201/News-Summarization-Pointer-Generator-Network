They battled it out for the Premier League title over the last two years.

And it seems that neighbouring clubs Manchester United and Manchester City are also top of the table when it comes to ripping off fans over replica football kits.

Stunned parents have hit out at the two Premier League clubs after it emerged their children’s strips have crossed the £100 barrier for the first time.

Rip-off? Manchester City stars parade their team's new Nike home strip, which costs more than £100 for the child's version

Expensive: Next season's United kit, left, and City's latest strip, right. They are the only two Premier League clubs to charge over £50 for adult shirts

Parents have blasted both clubs and strip manufacturer Nike, with some saying they will refuse to shell out the sum.

It is the first time the price for an entire mini replica football kit - consisting of shirt, shorts, socks, Premier League badge on the sleeve and name on the back - has crossed the three figure barrier.

Manchester City season ticket-holder Tony Morton, 42, recently paid £109 for a full kit with the name of footballer ‘Silva’ on the back.

Last season's Manchester United child's kit - the cost of the new strip is likely to smash the £100 barrier

Mr Morton, a revenue manager from Oldham, Greater Manchester, branded the price ‘ridiculous’ and said the clubs were putting parents’ under immense financial strain.

He said: ‘It’s a massive increase on last year. I know they have invested a lot in the team but this is silly. They [children] want to look like the players so they want a name on their backs and the Premier League badge on the sleeve.

‘They would have it on their backs every day so it wouldn’t last.’

Mr Morton, added: ‘The ticket prices for kids are great and by all means make money from merchandising, but not like this.

‘I probably could afford it but I have to draw the line somewhere. £109 for an 11-year-old’s kit is ridiculous.’

Adult shirts, priced at £55, are also the most expensive in the Premier League with United and City the only two teams in the Premier League to charge more than £50.

Last season’s City shirt, made by Umbro, retailed for around £44 - meaning this year’s is up by more than 24 per cent. United’s shirt was £50, meaning the increase is 10 per cent.

Chelsea are the other top-four team to bring out a new home shirt. Manufactured by Adidas, their shirt retails for £49.99.

It is understood that Arsenal, whose kit is also made by Nike, will be releasing a new away strip with price details to come in the next fortnight.

Liverpool have also released details of their new home jersey. The traditional red number, made by US firm Under Armour, costs £45.

Laughing all the way to the bank: City striker Carlos Tevez's facial expression probably mirrors the club's money men, who are raking in £109 from parents for the new child's strip

Up until recently clubs only changed their two shirts - home and away - in alternate seasons. But that now appears to be a thing of the past with many producing three or four different shirts which they change every year.

This is the first time Nike have made a City strip after they signed a six-year deal reported to be worth £72m with the club.

United are said to earn £23.5m a year from their agreement with the same company which expires at the end of the new season. The Red Devils are currently negotiating a new deal with Nike.

The high price of supporting a football club has been a long-standing complaint among fans. Not only do season tickets now cost more than £1,000 in some cases, but the clubs usually charge a fee for the right just to be on the waiting list to obtain season tickets.

Costly: Manchester United striker Robin Van Persie is an idol for thousands of fans, who want to have his name on the back of their shirts, which costs even more money

In 2003, Umbro, the English FA, Manchester United and six sports chains were fined more than £16 million by the Office of Fair Trading for colluding to inflate the price of football shirts.

A City spokesman revealed that the shirts were actually £5 cheaper than the suggested price of £60 - which is what the new England shirt, also made by Nike, is selling for.

He said: ‘The cost reflects value to the consumer through design, innovation, development, manufacturing, and retailing. CityStores are pricing the adult shirt £5 cheaper than the RRP.’

A spokesman for United said that pricing was an issue for Nike.

A Nike spokesman said: ‘The kits contain innovative performance technologies that have a certain amount of R&D costs and although the retailer sets the prices of the kit, we feel the £60 suggested retail price for the adult shirt and £42 SRP for the kids’ shirt represents good value given the level of technology and design which goes into it.’
