Portuguese police have dealt another devastating blow to the parents of Madeleine McCann by refusing to reopen the investigation into her disappearance, claiming there is no new evidence.

But only yesterday, Scotland Yard said there were 195 potential leads in the case and declared the missing child 'could still be alive'.

Just hours before the Portuguese announcement, Kate and Gerry McCann spoke of their hopes for a fresh examination of the case by Portuguese officials.

This morning, the couple's spokesman Clarence Mitchell said: 'Kate and Gerry welcome this and they are hugely 
encouraged by what the police have been doing all of this last year 
since the launch of the investigative review.

'They (Scotland Yard) believe that it is quite possible that Madeleine 
could still be alive and that is what Kate and Gerry have said 
throughout the five years and they are hugely encouraged by all of this 
momentum in the case.'

He added that like the British police, Mr and Mrs McCann want the case 
to be reopened but it is 'up to the Portuguese authorities'.

But their hopes were dashed just hours later when Pedro do Carmo, deputy head of the 
criminal police department, said: 'There are no new elements at the 
moment that would allow for the reopening of the inquiry.'

Detectives in Portugal were thought to be keen to re-open the case, despite needed judicial approval via the courts.

The announcement is the latest in a 
series of blows to the McCanns from Portuguese authorities ever since 
Maddie vanished five years ago.

Shortly afterwards, both parents were wrongly named as suspects and questioned by Portuguese police.

Then, four years ago, the official inquiry into her disappearance was shelved.

Her parents repeatedly called on officials to resume the search for Maddie, who vanished just days before her fourth birthday in 2007.

Yesterday, the family released an image of how Maddie could look now aged nine.

Speaking on the age-advanced picture of Madeleine, Mr Mitchell said: 'They are very pleased that the new age-progressed 
image of Madeleine aged nine was put out yesterday, which is getting 
wide publicity today.

'Of course, that is the girl that people should 
still be looking for.

'We need to remind people around the world that this is probably what 
Madeleine looks like today, not the very famous picture of her when she 
went missing. This is Madeleine as a young girl now.

'Kate particularly feels there is a very strong family resemblance. She 
sees Madeleine, Sean and Amelie her brother and sister, and herself in 
the image.'

Yesterday, the detective leading the Metropolitan Police review said the case could still be solved.

Detective Chief Inspector Andy Redwood said he believed her 
disappearance was a stranger abduction, as he said there were 195 'investigative opportunities'.

But police refused to say what evidence they had uncovered to suggest Madeleine was alive.

Mr Redwood confirmed that his team of more than 30 officers involved in 
the case had been to Portugal seven times, including a visit to the 
family’s holiday flat in Praia da Luz.

It will be five years next week since the three-year-old went missing as her parents dined with friends nearby.

The investigative review was launched last year after a meeting between 
former Met commissioner Sir Paul Stephenson and the Home Office.

Five years of uncertainty: Madeleine's parents, Kate and Gerry McCann, still hope for their daughter's rescue

Is she alive?

There have been no confirmed sightings of Madeleine McCann since she disappeared on May 3, 2007.

The original Portuguese police team believed she died in a ‘tragic accident’.

Kate and Gerry McCann have always insisted there is no evidence to suggest she is dead, and British police now believe ‘there is a possibility she is alive’.

Where is she?

There have been reported sightings all round  the world, ranging from the credible to bizarre psychic visions.

Of those investigated, none have been confirmed as Madeleine.

Who is responsible?

Three people were officially named as arguidos, or suspects, in the investigation - Kate and Gerry McCann and British expat Robert Murat.

All three were formally cleared when the investigation was shelved and have won libel cases against newspapers and broadcasters which falsely claimed they were involved in Madeleine’s disappearance.

The McCanns believe Madeleine was taken by an abductor.

Convicted paedophile Raymond Hewlett allegedly said he saw the girl twice before she vanished and claimed she was stolen to order by a gypsy gang, but denied he was involved.

He died in 2010.

Are there new leads?

British police have identified almost 200 new lines of investigation from the Portuguese case files and the McCanns’ own private detectives.

They have refused to reveal details.

Why was this not done before?

Portuguese officers were convinced Madeleine was dead and have admitted publicly that they did not fully investigate other theories, including many of the sightings.

What else was missed?

Police did not set up effective searches and did not alert the Spanish border for 12 hours, allowing a potential abductor to escape with Madeleine undetected.

Even a basic check of the other guests at the Ocean Club resort in Praia da Luz was not completed for 48 hours, by which time many potential witnesses had left.

What about forensic evidence?

Police did not seal off the McCanns’ apartment until 10am the next day, by which time the McCanns, their friends, resort staff, concerned helpers and police officers had all potentially contaminated forensic evidence.

Samples were taken and tested for blood and DNA but were found to be so degraded and contaminated that the results were inconclusive.

Will the case be solved?

British police want the case reopened but public opinion in Portugal has not been supportive of the McCanns and there may be little interest in raking over a five-year mystery which has already damaged the country’s tourist industry.

Even if the case is reopened, the reality remains that blunders in the first few days after Madeleine’s disappearance may mean the McCanns will never know what happened to their daughter.
