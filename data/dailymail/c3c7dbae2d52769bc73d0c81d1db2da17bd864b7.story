Spartak Moscow have opened the bidding on West Ham target Aleksandar Dragovic with a £12million offer to his club Dynamo Kiev.

West Ham scouts were among the crowd that watched Dragovic play for Austria in their 1-0 win over Russia on Saturday. 

They were joined by representatives from Manchester United who are weighing up various potential centre-back signings and the 23-year-old turned in a steady performance.

Dragovic is keen to leave Ukraine and has his mind set on a move to the Premier League but Spartak's bold move will make it difficult as English clubs value him closer to £8million.

Spartak are also prepared to offer a lucrative wage package of around £90,000 a week to attract the former Basle defender although he would be prepared to take less to come to England.

West Ham are looking at defenders in case they are forced to cash in on Winston Reid in January. 

They are also keen on Fulham defender Dan Burn who would cost considerably less but is still seen as a player of potential.
