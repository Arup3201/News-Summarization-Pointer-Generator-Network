A loyal dog refused to leave a graveside for two weeks in a remarkable display of devotion after the death of his teenage owner.

After Bhaskar Shri, 18, died in a car accident, his dog Tommy went without food and water for 15 baking days and freezing nights guarding his grave in Chennai, southern India.

The young construction worker had adopted the dog five years ago and the two quickly became inseparable. Then, when Bhaskar was killed in a tragic road collision the dog refused to leave him. 

Loyal: Tommy the dog sits by his owner's grave, where he stayed for two weeks until he was rescued

Mourning: Tommy's owner, Bhaskar Shri, was killed in a road accident on August 2

Dawn Williams, an animal rescue officer working with the non-profit Blue Cross of India finally rescued the famished dog after he endured more than a fortnight in the open.

She said: ‘I first spotted the brown dog sitting on a fresh grave one evening as I happen to walk past in the first week of August, but at the time I didn’t think anything of it.

‘But on August 13 I was in the area again while on a different rescue mission and saw him again. He was sitting in the same spot in the same position. 

'It looked like he hadn’t moved for weeks.’

The dog seemed troubled, even apparently having tears in his eyes as she approached him, Ms Williams said.

'I could see he was in a disturbed condition. He was famished and I’m certain he had tears in his eyes,' she said.

'I gave him water and biscuits but he refused to move. Then, with my teammates, I walked around the area and asked locals if they knew the dog.

'They told me the dog was called Tommy and he was guarding his owner’s grave.’

Inseparable: Bhaskar, who was 18, adopted Tommy five years ago, and they were always together

Enduring: An animal rescue officer from the Blue Cross of India believes Tommy was there for two weeks

Ms Williams finally managed to track down Bhaskar’s mother, Shrimati Sundari, also a construction worker.

She added: ‘When Tommy saw her; he jumped on her and was licking her before he rested his face on her feet. It was obvious he knew her.'

Ms Sundari told Ms Williams her son and Tommy were always together, even at the construction sites. But after the car accident on August 2 Tommy had disappeared. 

She thought he’d found another home.

‘She was really happy he was back. She called him a loyal friend and she would keep him as a reminder of her son,' said Ms Williams.

'It was quite sad seeing them walk off together. But I was glad they were reunited. I’m sure Tommy will help Shrimati with her grief, dogs are amazing in times of emotion.’
