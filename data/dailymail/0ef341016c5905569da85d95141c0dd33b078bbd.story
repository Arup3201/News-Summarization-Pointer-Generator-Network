Most of us have spent long uncomfortable nights being kept awake by a raucous party at a neighbour's house or flat.

But while the majority will have just buried their head under the duvet and shut all the windows, one Londoner decided to put his inability to sleep to good use and compile a detailed critique of the 'terrible' karaoke that disturbed him.

Oli Beale then pinned a giant newspaper-style review to the board in the communal area of his Hackney block of flats and then posted a picture on Twitter.

His handmade complaint included timings and titles of songs sung, how it was performed and a rating out of 10.

After the 'singing/screaming' finished at 9.10am, his final message to his east London neighbours was simply: 'I hate you'.

The 33-year-old, who works in advertising, wrote to the mystery group who did the 'epic performance' on a balcony in the middle of the night.

'Your terrace faces 115 windows so you really did have the perfect stage. I'm sure you are keen to hear our verdict,' he wrote.

First up was The Who's classic Pinball Wizard, which received a 'terrible' three out of ten at 2.23am.

At 3.14am was Aerosmith's duet with Run DMC: Walk This Way, which Mr Beale gave a 1 in ten and called 'the lowest point of the performance' and its chorus was repeated every ten minutes for the rest of the night, he said.

At 8.20am there was Elton John's balled Tiny Dancer, which was 'actually very good - if you're going to be woken up after only two hours sleep  it might as well be to a herd of morons screaming Tiny Dancer'.

The finale came at 9.10am with The Cure's single Friday I'm in Love, which was a 'return to poor form'.

Quoting its famous first line 'I don't care if Monday's blue' Mr Beale added: 'Judging by how wired you all looked by this stage, I can assure you Monday through to Thuirsday  will be very, very blue.'

Oli, after reviewing Friday I'm In Love, finished his missive with the words, 'I hate you'

It is not the first time Mr Beale's creative complaints have captured the imagination.

Three years ago he wrote to Sir Richard Branson about poor food on his Virgin flight, which was called the funniest complaint letter of all time.

He was so furious about his meal between Mumbai and London he sent six-pages of complaints with pictures of his food.

He called it his 'culinary journey of
hell' and asked Sir Richard to consider how he had felt as a child when he opened Christmas presents, saying: 'It's your hamster Richard. It's your hamster in the box and it's not 
breathing. That's how I felt when I peeled back the foil.'
