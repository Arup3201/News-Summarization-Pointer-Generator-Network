A woman who works as a professional sex toy tester rakes in £15,000 a year having 15 orgasms a week - all in the name of work.

Cara Houiellebecq has an office crammed with more than 2,000 toys that she test drives for adult companies - before being paid to review each one on her blog.

The mother-of-two from Lincoln, who became an erotic blogger five years ago, spends seven hours every week testing the toys.

Now that's a niche job! Cara Houiellebecq is a professional sex toy tester - and rakes in £15,000 a year from brands who send her their products to review

The 33-year-old has sex toys delivered to her door four or five times a week and the toys have now become part of her everyday life.

Speaking about her job, Cara said: 'Toys have always been a part of my private sex life - it gave me the idea to start writing about my sex life and I had the idea to start testing sex toys.

'It’s a great job, I’ve worked in a bank before but I’d never go back to that now - it’s never boring.'

Cara started her own blog with her toy reviews and began to get more and more hits. 'Gradually my reviews became more and more prolific and I was noticed by a sex toy company who wanted me to work for them,' she said.

Testing, testing! Cara started her own blog with her toy reviews and began to get more and more hits. 'Gradually my reviews became more and more prolific and I was noticed by a sex toy company who wanted me to work for them,' she said

'Now manufacturers and sellers will ask if they can send stuff to me because so many people read my reviews.'

Cara worked at a sex toy website for two years before leaving in February 2012 to set up on her own - and she has now won Best Erotic Journalist at the ETO awards for two consecutive years.

She has manufacturers from all over Britain sending her free toys to be reviewed and she also writes articles for companies as an industry consultant.

Cara said: 'My friends love to ask me about toys, I’m the person who knows the best ones to use and the cheapest ones to buy.

'I get messages from friends saying "my jiggle balls are broken - what should I get to replace them?"

'My favourite toy is a iGino One which you can charge via USB. I also love the Doxy Wand which is a mains powered magic wand - and I always recommend bullet vibrators.'

Cara has two children - the eldest is nine and the youngest 19-months old - and makes sure never to talk about her job around them.

She lives with her long-term partner, Darren, and his mother in their home in Gainsborough, Lincs.

Cara met partner Darren, 37, at work when he worked as a IT consultant for an e-tailer called SexToys.

Cara said: 'My partner doesn’t see it as a threat - we always say that toys are the seasoning to a sex life - not a replacement.

'When I get toys for men he helps me with the testing - it’s a part of our lives now.'
