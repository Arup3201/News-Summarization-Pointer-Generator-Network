They were inseparable for almost 30 years, travelling the world together climbing its toughest peaks.

But now Julie-Ann Clyma is having to adjust to life without her beloved husband Roger Payne, 55, who two weeks ago was leading a group up a peak when he and eight others were swept away by the 'deadliest Alps avalanche in years'.

Close friends John Taylor, 48, and Steve
Barber, 47, who lived on the same street in the village of Poppleton, 
near York, died alongside Mr Payne on the 4,649ft Mont Maudit, when a block of snow 60ft high and 500ft wide hit them in the early hours of Thursday, July 12.

Mr Payne has been described as a climber born 'with boot-shaped feet', intent on treading lightly and respectfully, always carrying down any rubbish he found left on mountains and careful not to take risks with himself or the climbers he helped guide for a living.

On one occasion in 1993, on K2, he even found and carried down bones and clothing belonging to American Art Gilkey, who was also swept to his death by an 
avalanche in 1953.

Mr Payne was also the first person to ascent Mount Grosvenor in China, Khan Tengri 
and Pobeda in Kazakhstan, and throughout most of his 30-year career he had one 
constant beside him, his beloved wife Julie-Ann.

'I loved being with him, we did so much together, I feel so lucky to have had those years with him,' she told MailOnline today.

'Honestly, I am not sure how I will feel, but I am fairly sure I will go back to work in the mountains.

'I
live in the mountains, they are all around me, and they hold so many 
good memories for me, of Roger. It was too much a part of both our 
lives. It would be difficult to walk away from that.'

Together the couple of 27 years set up a successful mountaineering company that ran tours across the Alps while also exploring mountains around the world on their own.

'We had big plans to reach unclimbed summits and find new routes but it 
was always with the understanding that the conditions could change at 
any minute.

'It was always more important to be safe and turn 
around and come back rather than keep going and take a risk with our 
lives. We always had a very practical approach. For us, being together 
was the most important thing. 

'In our personal climbing we 
wanted to say that we had pushed ourselves to the limit and achieved 
things that we knew we were capable of.

'But in our work lives 
the safety and security of people we took up mountains was so important.
Whatever they wanted to climb, we would always do everything we could 
to make sure that we would bring them back, and be safe ourselves.'

But there was nothing he could do when the deadly avalanche struck the group of 28 climbers.

'That
is what is so sad about what happened when Roger, Steve and John died,' Ms Clyma said.

'It was a place that had brought them so much joy, where they had been so
safe for so long. It is difficult to come to terms with the fact that 
it happened this way.

'It was a freak accident. I know that, and that is why it is very hard to cope with.'

Mr Payne, who had developed an avalanche
training programme, met his future wife, then a climbing 
instructor from New Zealand, on a mountain in South America.

They married in 1987 and lived in a chalet in Leysin, Switzerland, in the Alps.

'We
met on an expedition at a base camp party that Roger’s team mates had 
organised. That was in 1985. I guess it was our love of mountaineering that 
brought us together and two years later we married,' she said.

Speaking for the first time after his death, she has paid tribute to her 'generous and loving' husband.

'He was not like anyone else. We were together for 27 years and I feel like I learnt a huge amount from him,' she told MailOnline.

'He
was a very good man, an extremely generous and loving man. Even after 
27 years I still admired him and he inspired me. He was always thinking 
of what he would do next.'

In 1999 on the infamous Pumari Chhish peak in Pakistan the pair were trapped on the mountain's edge by avalanches and snow storms, which they were lucky to escape.

'We
were trying to find a new route and had put up tents on a ridge and 
then it just began to snow for days. We couldn't get up or down.

'We
waited for a break in the weather and we tried to get back down. Then 
incredibly really the sun burnt through and up there it can go from very
cold to extremely warm very quickly.

'This caused a small 
avalanche, that led to a big one which hit us. Luckily we had fixed a 
rope to the ridge above and luckily they held us when the avalanche hit 
us.

'That was probably the closest call we ever had. It did make us think.'

His tearful 91-year-old mother Nellie Payne, of Hammersmith, West London, said it best when she spoke about her son and his wife just after he died.

‘They were made for each other,’ she said. ‘They had a lovely life. Now Julie is all by herself and I don’t know what she will do.’ 

It appears that she now has an answer, Julie-Ann will continue to do what the inseparable  couple both loved to do together - climb mountains.
