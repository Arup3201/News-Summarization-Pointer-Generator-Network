Disturbing: Maddy Jackson, 4, sporting the new must-have accessory - removable breasts for toddlers

Barely out of nappies, four-year-old Maddy Jackson is already on the road to womanhood.

Sporting fake C cup breasts and padding on her bottom, she is the latest shock contestant on Toddlers and Tiaras, the U.S. reality show revealing the surreal world of beauty pageants.

In an attempt to mimic her curvaceous icon, country singer Dolly Parton - who is known for her ample cleavage - the toddler is shown sporting detachable bust and butt enhancements, before performing live on stage.

With the extra padding concealed under her Barbie pink Lycra catsuit, Maddy's tiny frame is transformed into an hourglass silhouette.

Barely able to string a sentence together, many will be shocked by the images of the peroxide blonde trying to emulate the appearance of a woman in her late 20s.

When questioned on NBC's Today show, her mother Lindsay, who entered her first pageant contest when she was nine months old, defends the enhancements used by her daughter.

She tells presenter Savannah 
Guthrie: 'To some people, it's over the top, to us it's just what happens... It's just normal. When she wears the fake boobs and the fake butt, it's just like extra bonus.'

But others seems less convinced and Maddy's stylist Michael Booth believes the attire is a step to far.

Interviewed backstage at the competition, where hundreds of young hopefuls battle it out to be crowned beauty queen, Michael said: 'I wasn’t a big fan of the outfit with the boobs in it. She’s very young, but hopefully the judges will perceive it in good taste.'

Other young contestants also seem perturbed by her appearance, as they watch Lindsay rearrange her daughter's fake breasts and one even probes the chicken fillets before Maddy crosses her arms defensively.

Lindsay says as she watches her child's confused expression: 'I don't think Maddy knew how to explain and why she had those enhancements on.'

Maddy's grandma, Barbara also defends the beauty pageant world, which is primarily concerned with contestant's external appearance, explaining that the cash prizes can be put towards expensive schooling fees and dozens of toys for the children.

The show has caused outcry with many who believe that it could influence youngsters to adopt similar behaviour and campaigners have even set up a Facebook group, 'Take "Toddlers And Tiaras" off the Air!' in a bid to have the plug pulled on the show.

Enthusiastic: Lindsay insists that competing in beauty pageants is a hobby that four-year-old Maddy enjoys

One fan, Teresa Spence Bruce commented: 'I just saw a commercial where they strapped silicone breast to a 4-5 yr old absolutely disgusting.'

Despite criticism Lindsay is happy for her child to be glamourised and states that her daughter thoroughly enjoys it as a hobby and can stop competing at any time.

She added: 'With anything people are going to think things are over the top but with gymnastics or dance or competitive cheer-leading you wear hair, you wear make up.'
