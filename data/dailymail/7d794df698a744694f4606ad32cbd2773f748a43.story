Sea The Moon, fancied by many to win this year’s Prix de l’Arc de Triomphe, suffered a shock defeat at the hands of Ivanhowe in the Grosser Preis Von Baden.

Previously unbeaten in four starts, the impressive German Derby winner was installed as ante-post favourite for the Paris feature after his 11-length romp in the Hamburg Classic back in July.

However, after making his own running in the hands of Cristian Demuro for the majority of the Group One event, Sea The Moon was overhauled inside the final furlong and readily eclipsed by Filip Minarik aboard Jean-Pierre Carvalho’s four-year-old.

Success: Sea The Moon is fancied for the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe, despite a shock defeat

Taking the lead: Coral have eased their odds from 7/2 to 6/1 but still fancy Sea The Moon for the Arc

Coral reacted by easing Sea The Moon to 6-1 (from 7-2) for the Arc, while Ivanhowe was introduced into the market at 16-1. Last year’s winner Treve is the 9-2 favourite. There were two big-race British successes in Turkey when Pether's Moon and Glory Awaits landed sizeable pots for their connections.

The former, trained by Richard Hannon, lifted the £150,000 International Bosphorus by a length from Village Wind following a typically patient Richard Hughes ride.

Glory Awaits, partnered by Neil Callan, was aggressively ridden from the front and found plenty when challenged by Our Channel and Toormore to score by a hard-fought half a length in the £225,000 Topkapi Trophy.
