With broken furniture, mounds of rubbish and inches of dust, these are the shocking states of houses that were trashed by students this year.

The properties, situated in upmarket areas of Manchester, were discovered in an 'unbelievable' condition by an estate agent after university students had left for the summer.

Some featured broken bed frames and rooms littered with rubbish, while one had been left with a gaping hole in its wall.

Shockingly, one set of students had even taken a door off its hinges and used it as a makeshift coffee table in the months leading up to the end of the academic term.

The damage at the properties in Fallowfield and Withington was discovered by estate agent Nigel Loughtman, of Tiger Property in Didsbury, this month.

'Some of the states the properties have been left in are unbelievable,' he said.

'We try to talk to tenants and make sure they understand about returning the property in the state they found it to get their full deposit back but it doesn't always happen.

Messy: Meanwhile, another's large boiler room was littered with rubbish, abandoned clothing and thick dust

'I would say only one per cent of our student tenants get none of their deposit back at all, but only around 10 per cent get all of it back.

'On average we charge £70 per student to clean up the property but we have an in-house maintenance team.'

He said that as well as multiple breakages and rubbish, stale food had been left splattered over the surfaces of many of the properties.

A bad night's sleep: But incredibly, he added that the cases were not the most shocking examples of trashed student houses that he has heard of. Above, a bed frame featuring several broken planks at one property

But incredibly, he added that the cases were not the most shocking examples of trashed student houses that he has heard of.

'A friend told me three or four years ago that a room inspection found one bedroom had all the furniture removed and instead there was a large inflatable swimming pool which filled the room,' he said.

'It was full and someone had painted a beach scene on the wall and they were throwing pool parties.

In need of repair: The door-turned-coffee-table that was among many damaged items found by Mr Loughtman

'If that had burst, his room would have been flooded with thousands of litres of water.'

It comes just weeks after students in Withington destroyed the ground floor of their eight-bedroom house after the floor collapsed during an end-of-exam party with up to 300 guests. 

At the time the landlord of the property, who did not wish to be named, said: 'Letting off steam after exams is quite normal, but should be done in a safe and organised manner with the local residents in mind.'
