With huge, doe eyes reminiscent of Audrey Hepburn, a pair of eyebrows to rival Cara's and a Hollywood career that's going from strength to strength, it was only a matter of time before Lily Collins landed a big beauty contract.

So it's no surprise to hear French beauty house Lancôme has snapped up Lily Collins to act as its new brand ambassador.

The 24-year-old actress will join the likes of Julia Roberts (she made her
acting debut alongside the Pretty Woman actress in Mirror Mirror), as well as Emma Watson and Daria 
Werbowy, from January 2014.

New face: Lily Collins, 24, has been announced as an ambassadress for French house Lancôme

Her first campaign will be for the house's French Ballerine collection for Spring.

'It's an absolute honor and privilege to have been chosen to represent the Maison Lancôme.

'I have always admired the brand's unique and distinctive appreciation for inner beauty and grace, elegance and utter radiance.

'I
feel incredibly lucky to be included among the most inspirational women
ambassadresses for one of the most prestigious brands in the world. 
It's truly a dream come true,' said Lily of her new role.

'With
her charm, gracefulness, modernity and lively wit, Lily Collins is the 
perfect embodiment of femininity according to Lancôme.'

'We
are delighted to begin this collaboration with Lily, who brings a 
renewed sense of radiance and youthfulness to Lancôme,' said Françoise 
Lehmann, General Manager of Lancôme International.

A rising Hollywood star, Lily divides her time between England, the country of her birth, and the United States, where she currently lives.

Of mixed European and American descent - and fittingly the granddaughter of a ballerina - Lily initially set her sights on a career in journalism. However, a dazzling debut in The Blind Side with Sandra Bullock, followed by Mirror Mirror in 2009 showed movies were her destiny.

She will next be on screen in 2014 in Love, Rosie, a romantic comedy adapted from the novel Where Rainbows End by the Irish author Cecelia Ahern.

'A free-spirited, confident, sparkling and delicate beauty, Lily Collins – who bears a singular resemblance to the iconic Audrey Hepburn – will bring her talent and freshness to Lancôme as of January 2014, starting with the Spring make-up collection French Ballerine,' said a spokesman for the brand.
