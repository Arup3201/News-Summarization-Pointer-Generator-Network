It was the day after a wretched night before and Brendan Rodgers, still grappling with Liverpool's Champions League defeat in Basle, was talking strikers.

Given that Mario Balotelli had been anonymous for most of the game in Switzerland and Daniel Sturridge was still injured, Rodgers had been asked whether Liverpool had made sufficient moves during the transfer window just gone to cover Luis Suarez's departure.

In a flash, he provided an answer that offered a tantalising glimpse of what the future might hold.  

Divock Origi has started this season well for Lille, including scoring a penalty against Wolfsburg

Luis Suarez was the Premier League's best player last season and Liverpool have struggled to replace him

With Daniel Sturridge out injured, Brendan Rodgers' side have struggled to find their best form

Divock Origi is doing better than Liverpool's four other strikers. He has scored four goals in nine club matches this season.

Daniel Sturridge scored once in his three matches before his injury

Mario Balotelli has also found the net once in eight Liverpool matches (he has picked up two yellow cards, however)

Rickie Lambert has not scored in eight appearances

Fabio Borini has no goals in three matches 

Liverpool spent close to £110million in the summer and it is the £9m they handed over to Lille for Divock Origi which Rodgers believes could be the finest investment.

'There are very few players who can replace Suarez,' Rodgers explained. 'Actually there are no players who can replace Suarez. When you look at the availability of other players during the summer, it was something that was difficult for us.

'It's no good now I know but we took a player in Divock Origi who we believe will be world class and we'll get him in the summer. Now he is a top player. He has everything: the speed, the profile and so on and he (could) play (for Liverpool) now.'

Origi has always been highly-regarded, as one story from his youth shows. When he was a 13-year-old, his first club Genk had taken all their age-group squads to the Belgian coast for pre-season training and on the last night, they had a 'keepie-up' challenge.

Divock Origi shot to fame with his goal at the World Cup, but Liverpool were interested before that

Players were invited on to stage to show off their skills, with some players doing 30, others doing 70. When it came to Origi, he did a remarkable 1,500. 

Those close to him say he likes to play the game 'beautifully' and enjoys pulling off technical tricks.

'Our deal was that we couldn't bring him in now,' Rodgers continued. 'That was unfortunate because he can run in behind (the defence), he can keep the ball, he can press and he can run but that (Origi staying with Lille) was part of the deal.'

There is no chance Origi will be allowed to come to Anfield in January but it is clear that Rodgers is already counting down the days until he gets to start working on a day-to-day basis with a 19-year-old who shot to prominence during the World Cup.

The young Belgian rose to prominence in Brazil, where injuries and form led to him starting twice for Belgium

Liverpool had been working quietly on a deal to sign him long before he scored against Russia.

The wheels of his switch to Merseyside had already started rolling and the move was not a reaction to that moment of magic in the footballing cathedral the Maracana.

Of all the deals Liverpool concluded during a frantic three-month period, the ones that were met with most satisfaction involved Origi and Emre Can, as they illustrate what the club under Fenway Sports Group are aiming to promote.

The idea is to buy outstanding young talent at a reasonable price and use Rodgers' ability on the coaching field to transform them into genuine world class players.

An ankle injury has prevented Can from showing what he can do so far, while Origi is across the Channel.

Emre Can is another of Liverpool's young recruits who has not yet made an impact but suits the philosophy

Origi is with the Belgium squad ahead of their fixtures with Andorra and Bosnia this week

But while he is out of sight, he is not out of mind. Liverpool are closely monitoring his progress – he has scored three goals in Ligue 1 and one in the Europa League this season, helping Lille get off to a solid start – and Rodgers, Origi has revealed, is in constant contact.

'Sometimes Brendan sends me some messages and sometimes people from Liverpool come and visit me in Lille,' said Origi. 

'It's good to know they are following my progress. Things are going well but there's still some room for improvement.

'I'm still working hard trying to prepare myself for a higher level. I'm feeling good and ready to continue this form. 

Mario Balotelli and Rickie Lambert have failed to hit their stride since arriving at Anfield this summer

Origi is keen to arrive at his parent club next summer, as Liverpool hope to develop him into a top player

'It's a new era at Liverpool and everything will go well. They have a fantastic team. It's only positive and I don't think we have to worry about Liverpool.'

Rodgers may have caused eyebrows to raise amongst some Liverpool supporters when he admitted that his side have been 'unrecognisable' from the swashbuckling group of last season and that a period of transition beckons.

One thing that he cannot be accused of lacking, however, is a vision and the arrival of Origi is something he believes will accelerate this group even further. 

Where this particular player is concerned, the end of the current season cannot come quick enough for Liverpool.
