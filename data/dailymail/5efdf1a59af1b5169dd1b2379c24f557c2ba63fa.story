Sir Mark Thatcher yesterday left the his mother's home in Belgravia, telling reporters the Iron Lady would have been moved by her funeral

Margaret Thatcher could not have had a ‘finer commemoration’ of her life than this week’s extraordinary ceremonial funeral, her son Sir Mark has said.

He expressed heartfelt thanks to everyone involved in Wednesday’s service, which he called a ‘splendidly dignified and deeply moving farewell’ for Britain’s greatest peacetime prime minister.

Writing on behalf of himself and sister Carol, Sir Mark gave his first detailed remarks since the funeral in a letter to Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude, seen by the Daily Mail.

‘I wanted to write to thank you and, through you, all those many people who were involved in the planning, organisation and conduct of my Mother’s funeral,’ he wrote.

‘This was an immense and complex task and yet it was accomplished with the utmost skill, sensitivity and attention to every possible detail.

‘The result was a splendidly dignified and deeply moving farewell that will, I am sure, live long in the memory of all those present.

‘Carol and I could not have hoped for a finer commemoration of my Mother’s life; and we will always be hugely grateful to you and to all the departments, organisations and indeed individuals represented on the True Blue committee who made it possible.’

Mr Maude chaired the Whitehall committee, codenamed True Blue, which put into place detailed plans for the funeral at St Paul’s Cathedral. They were drawn up under the last Labour government and approved by the administrations of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown.

Officials from the Cabinet Office, Foreign Office, Home Office, Culture Department and the Government whips’ office were all involved in coordinating the event.

‘It was a massive occasion for the Cabinet Office to organise on a tight timetable,’ said a source.

Mr Maude has said that the bill for the funeral, criticised by some Labour MPs, will be ‘much, much less’ than a reported figure of £10 million, but no official estimate has yet been released.

Whitehall sources said there have been no detailed discussions about funeral services for any of the surviving former prime ministers – Mr Blair, Sir John Major and Gordon Brown.

At only 70, John Major is now the oldest living former prime minister – the lowest age for the holder of that position at any time since World War Two.

But one source added: ‘Francis Maude has made it clear he would not object to a similar scale of funeral for Tony Blair, who like Margaret Thatcher did win three general elections.

‘Whether you like him or not, that is quite a big deal. Given the relative youth of our former prime ministers there has not been any detailed planning for this. Margaret Thatcher left very detailed instructions and most former prime ministers will have a clear idea of what they want.’

The Thatcher family is now expected to grieve in private and wait several months before her ashes are interred alongside those of her beloved husband, Sir Denis, at the Royal Hospital in Chelsea.

A range of proposals to commemorate her life and leadership of Britain is being considered, from a Thatcher library to a statue in Parliament Square and the renaming of the capital of the Falklands, Stanley, to Port Margaret.

Sir Mark had already said yesterday 
that his mother would have been ‘profoundly moved and gratified’ by her 
spectacular ceremonial funeral.

Speaking
outside Lady Thatcher's home in Belgravia, Sir Mark said: ‘My mother 
would have been profoundly moved and gratified by the send-off she was 
given.’

It is thought the 
ashes will be interred in the autumn. A family friend told the Daily 
Telegraph: ‘They are very conscious that there will be a lot of interest
surrounding the interment of the ashes.

‘They
thought it would be better to do it at some point in the future. The 
family have heard some of the ideas but they need to think about it.’

Lady
Thatcher’s granddaughter Amanda, 19, who gave a moving reading during 
the service, has returned to America to prepare for exams next week at 
the University of Richmond, Virginia.

She has flown back to the US with brother Michael and mother Diane Beckett, Sir Mark's first wife.

Downing Street is expected to publish details of the costs of the funeral as early as next week.

The Prime Minister’s official spokesman said: ‘We will publish the costs in due course. I think people will understand it can take a little time to draw together the final costings for high-profile and significant events such as yesterday’s funeral.

‘That is what is being done, and we will publish the costs.’

Asked whether the figure would include the full cost of the thousands of police and military personnel who were present at yesterday’s event, the spokesman said: ‘It will take account of the fact that a significant proportion of the personnel involved in the funeral ceremony would already have been on working duty.’

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg defended the use of taxpayers’ money for Lady Thatcher’s funeral, dismissing the objections of some Labour MPs by pointing out plans had been agreed under the governments of Mr Blair and Mr Brown.

‘There’s nothing new about the government of the day supporting funeral costs for significant public figures and, of course, former prime ministers - that is actually quite an established convention and has happened before,’ he told LBC 97.3.

‘These plans were not suddenly invented out of thin air, these were worked on over a long period of time, were pretty well established in detail by the previous government, not this coalition Government, and of course with the full consent, co-operation and support of the family.

‘Of course, I can hear that there are people who have differing views but whether you are for or against Margaret Thatcher, everybody recognises she was a very significant political figure and this was a big occasion and that it was done on a cross-party basis.’
