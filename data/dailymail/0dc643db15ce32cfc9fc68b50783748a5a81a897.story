It's now home to 20,000 crocodiles and less than a dozen people, but a remote area on the border of Western Australia and the Northern Territory has been handpicked by an architecture company as the ideal location for a second national capital.

Lake Argle in the East Kimberley, near Kununurra, was created by the block of the Ord River in the 1960s and could potentially be the habitat of 150,000 people if a new northern capital is developed on the shores.

The top of Australia remains quite empty, with Cairns and Darwin dominating that region.

Currently home to 20,000 crocodiles and less than a dozen people, a remote area on the border of Western Australia and the Northern Territory has been handpicked by an architecture company as the ideal location for a second hypothetical national capital

But now, Landscape architecture company Ecoscape, plans to utilize the vast area, creating an international airport which could connect the East Kimberley with Asian destinations like Jakarta and Hong Kong.

'We just thought here's a perfect opportunity and such beautiful scenery,' Ecoscape environmental scientist David Kaesehagen said.

'It's got industries around it, it's got mining and agribusiness, it's got a whole range of different industries which can attract and hold people, so the place itself has got such intrinsic beauty that works to glue people to place,' Mr Kaesehagen said.

The need to more densely popular Australia's north has been a topic of discussion for a while, and now Lake Argyle is the perfect site, with plentiful amounts of water, land and sunshine.

But locals are not as enthusiastic about the proposal, insisting remoteness is the beauty of Lake Argyle.

'One side of me says we want to keep it remote, and we don't want an enormous city here, the other side of me says there are big advantages in bringing people into the area," said tour operator Greg Smith to ABC.

He believes that it would be a challenge to find people willing to live in the northern part of Australia, with scorching temperatures.

Mr Kaesehagen agrees with Mr Smith's comments, suggesting it is a government with a big vision that can make it happen.

In 2010, demographer Bernard Salt predicted by 2050 Australia will experience a population boom so a plan for a new city, like a Gold Coast of the west is necessary, The Age reported.

'It might be appropriate to look for a new city up north, in the same way that in the last 50 years we've created the Gold Coast,' Mr Salt said.

In recent times, Western Australia transformed Karratha a small town in Pilbara into one of Australia's richest regional towns.

Due to the mining boom, the city originally with one supermarket was completely transformed into a thriving town, with an average income of $87,000, reports International Business Times.

Professor Hugo discusses Australia's approach in the '70s, where a new city was viable due to increased mobility and city infrastructure under pressure.

'Whether it's a new city or development in places less affected by climate change, such as Tasmania, or the northern parts of Australia, all those options have to be on the table,' he said.
