Recreating life on Mars for two weeks in a Utah desert seems like child’s play compared to this project.

Intrepid volunteers are currently getting prepared to live in Antarctica, one of the most hostile and remotest places on Earth.  

The Concodia team will be simulating life on Mars in the barren continent for nine months at an altitude of 3200 metres.

Concordia research station in Antarctica is located on a plateau 3200 m above sea level. A place of extremes, temperatures can drop to ¿80°C in the winter, with a yearly average temperature of ¿50°C

Concordia is a joint French-Italian inland Antarctic research station run by the French Polar Institute and Italian Antarctic Programme.

Every year it hosts a human research protocol coordinated by ESA.

As Concordia lies at the very southern tip of Earth, the sun does not rise above the horizon in the winter and does not set in the summer.

The altitude and location mean that the air in Concordia is very thin and holds less oxygen. Venturing outside the base requires wearing layers of clothes and limits the time spent outdoors. 

In addition, Concordia sits in the largest desert in the world. The air is extremely dry, so the crew suffer from continuously chapped lips and irritated eyes.

No animals can survive in this region – even bacteria find it hard coping with the extreme temperatures.

This means they’ll be living with a third less oxygen than is available at sea level.

During the Antarctic winter, the crew will endure four months of complete darkness: the sun disappears from the beginning of May, and is not seen again until late August.

Living in isolation with a European crew of 13 and in the world's most extreme environment creates an ideal opportunity to conduct research into the adaptation of human psychology and physiology.

For the past summer months over 60 scientists and technicians have been working on research that can only be performed in the extremely cold, desolate desert of Antarctica.

Wrapping up their work, aircraft are now ferrying equipment and people back to the coast where the weather is more agreeable.

Once the sun sets below the horizon for four months in May, the region will really start to get cold.

With temperatures reaching –80°C, fuel freezes and aircraft cannot land. Even bulldozers and other vehicles are stored unused in an underground shelter until the next summer.

The core crew, the tenth team to spend winter at Concordia, will have to rely on their supplies for survival and their own legs to get around.

Leaving the base to check on equipment or take snow samples is a hard enough undertaking in itself as multiple layers of clothing are required to keep warm and walking is strenuous owing to the lack of oxygen.

Left to their own devices, the Concordia ‘DC10 crew’ have a few months to prepare for the onset of winter, cleaning the base and settling in to their habitat.

In the great open landscape covered in darkness, colours, smells and sounds are almost non-existent, adding to the sense of loneliness

Medical doctor Adrianos Golemis will be watching the crew and himself closely as their bodies and minds cope with the extreme isolation and environment.

As a stand-in for a human outpost on another planet, ESA is researching crew behaviour and physiology in stressful environments.

Unlike simulated isolation studies in other space analogues, the Concordia crew know that no one can help them for nine months – there is no quick exit back to civilisation.

In a separate project to find out how humans would cope on Mars, an experiment organised by the Mars Society has attempted to recreate the daily routine of astronauts here on Earth.

For two weeks in January, a group of intrepid space enthusiasts donned space suits and lived in isolation, surviving on rations and showering around once every three days.

Among them was Elizabeth Howell, a University of North Dakota student, who heard about volunteers for the project through a fellow student.

Speaking to MailOnline, she describes the unusual experiment as enlightening and at times overwhelming.

‘When I was in a spacesuit I felt like I was in an outside world,’ said Ms Howell. ‘It makes you think and behave differently.’

‘There wasn’t much personal space,’ she said. ‘There were a couple of disagreements.

Only little things, like noise in the kitchen when you have to work out what to do. We quickly found out that we need to talk about these things at the beginning.’

If an argument did occur, crew members couldn’t just step outside to cool off. Leaving the Habitat Module required a request to Mission Support a day in advance.
