A Mississippi lawmaker has been accused of racism after accusing all of the black people in his town of being on welfare benefits and food stamps.

State Representative Gene Alday sparked outrage after making the comments in an interview with local media.

The Republican, who was first elected to the House of Representatives in 2011 and was a former mayor of the town of Walls, was asked about improving education and boosting reading levels by electing superintendents in schools.

Mississippi representative Gene Alday stands before the house to apologise for comments he made about black people in a local newspaper interview 

But he disagreed with the idea telling the Clarion Ledger: 'I come from a town where all the blacks are getting food stamps and what I call 'welfare crazy checks'. They don't work.'

He later turned to healthcare provision in his hometown in Desoto County by recalling a trip to the emergency room, saying: 'I like died.

'I laid in there for hours because they (black people) were in there being treated for gunshots.'

Fellow Republicans were quick to distance themselves from Mr Alday's comments and House Representatives also called for his resignation.

They held a press conference saying they were concerned by his use of language and are calling for discussions with top elected officials to discuss the issue.

Mr Alday had said that all of the blacks from his hometown of Walls were all on welfare benefits and were receiving food stamps 

This prompted Mr Alday to say his comments were taken out of context and that he isn't a 'bad person' when he addressed the chamber on Tuesday.

He also denied being racist, saying he was a supporter of civil rights.

He added: 'Yes, it's true that most of the blacks in my hometown are on welfare. But they're good people. I don't have anything against anybody.

'I'm a straight-up guy. In my little town they had little civil rights walks and I was with them. I'm with everybody.'

His apology was greeted with applause by the house and he says he will stand for re-election despite the calls for him to step down.
