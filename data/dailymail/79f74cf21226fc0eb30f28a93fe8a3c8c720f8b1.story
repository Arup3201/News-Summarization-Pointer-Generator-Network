An international rugby referee who threw his baby son from a bridge before jumping to his own death had recently split up from his wife, it has been claimed.

Neighbours and friends have also revealed distraught Jason Lees, 40, was being comforted by his two-year-old son Brad in the days before their 'murder-suicide' death.

They recounted the 'heart-wrenching day' they saw Brad hugging his weeping father on the back stairs of their Brisbane, Australia, home.

And they said they thought his decision to kill his own son and then take his own life was because his psychologist wife Danielle Sutton no longer lived with him.

Lees, who taught at the exclusive Anglican Church Grammar School, rode his bike to Brisbane's 243ft-high Story Bridge at 2.30am on Monday morning.

He threw his toddler over the edge, before jumping himself - they both landed in parkland on the banks of the Brisbane River.

Marlene Stephens, who lives next door, told the Herald Sun: 'She left him a while back and you could hear and see him crying on the back stairs.

'I remember the little boy came down and wrapped his arms around him - I'm always going to remember that image. It was always so lovely to hear them laugh. He was a beautiful kid.'

Mr Lees met his future wife, who is currently being comforted by family on the Gold Coast, after he moved from Canada about 15 years ago.

His brother Bill said he met his baby nephew when his brother and family visited Canada in 2010 so Jason could referee an international rugby sevens match.

He said: 'That was the last time I saw them. I'm shocked... Nobody in my family I know saw this coming. There is more to this story.' Former colleagues and students have also paid tribute to the teacher.

Greg Wain, headmaster of The Southport School where Mr Lees worked until four years ago, said he was saddened by the tragedy.

He told the Telegraph: 'Jason left us four years ago and he is remembered fondly as a well-respected teacher and wonderfully caring man.'

And Anglican Church Grammar School headmaster Jonathan Hensman described the former teacher as 'enthusiastic, passionate and an honour to the profession'.

'The impact this sudden news has had on our community is significant and as we work through our grief we are concerned for our boys whom he taught in the classroom or coached on the sports field,' he told the Port Stephens Examiner.

Tragedy: Brisbane's Story Bridge from which Jason Lees threw his child before jumping himself

The tragedy is similar to an incident in 2009 when 37-year-old Arthur Freeman tossed his four-year-old daughter Darcey from Melbourne's Westgate Bridge - although he did not jump but gave himself up and was subsequently jailed for life.

A witness who saw the incident, at around 3.30am, called police who rushed to the scene but there was nothing they could do for Mr Lees or the child.

Police said they did not believe the child was the subject of a custody battle, unlike the child in the Melbourne tragedy.

Brisbane's Courier Mail newspaper said uniformed police and detectives had set up a screen around the bodies before they were taken away.

Forensic scientists began dusting the bridge rails for fingerprints. The police activity caused delays in early morning traffic.
