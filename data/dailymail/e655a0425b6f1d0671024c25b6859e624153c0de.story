She made history for her country by becoming the first Miss Angola to be crowned Miss Universe.

But Leila Lopes's victory has been questioned following allegations that false documents were used to help her get into an earlier pageant, where a win effectively put her into the main competition.

A man called Charles Mukano allegedly helped the 25-year-old get to the Miss Angola UK pageant, which only includes Angolan women living in Britain - despite her reportedly living in Angola.

Mr Mukano was reported by an Argentinian news source to be the organiser of the pageant that crowned her Miss Angola in her home country.

However Miss Universe officials told AOL 
Latino they have never even heard of Mr Mukano and the organiser who ran
the Miss Angola pageant is actually called Renato Guttler.

But Argentine news outlet Infobae 
reported Mr Mukano allegedly obtained false documents to say Lopes is a 
business student in Britain - and he had been questioned before about 
other documents.

Ms Lopes has not yet commented on the allegations. The Miss Universe Organization also told 
AOL Latino it denies other circulating rumours that Ms Lopes has Cuban 
parents and speaks Spanish.

When Ms Lopes won earlier this week, 
she laughed and smiled as she hugged runner-up Miss Ukraine, Olesia 
Stefanko, before having her crown firmly placed on her head at the 
pageant.

A winning combination: Miss Angola's evening wear and swimsuit parade won her Miss Universe, as well as her intelligent answered

The business student from Angola’s 
seaside city of Beguela, dazzled the panel of judges at the pageant in 
Sao Paulo, Brazil, with both her beauty and brains.

When she had been asked earlier what 
she might change about her physical characteristics, Leila replied that 
she was satisfied with who she was.

'I consider myself a woman endowed with inner beauty,' she told the judges and the audience.

'I have acquired many wonderful principles from my family, and I plan to follow those through the rest of my life.'

Her down-to-earth nature was 
complemented with immense outer beauty too though, which she showed off 
in a bright yellow bikini during the swimsuit parade.

After displaying her bikini body to 
millions of fans watching the pageant on TV around the world, Lopes 
paraded around the stage with poise in a form-fitting gold and silver 
sequinned evening gown.

Miss Angola bet 88 competitors in the 60th annual Miss Universe pageant.

Finalists accompanying Lopes into the 
top five were Miss Ukraine Olesia Stefanko, Miss Philippines Shamcey 
Supsup, Miss China Luo Zilin and Miss Brazil Priscila Machado.

While the other countries that made 
the top ten were Miss Australia Scherri-lee Biggs, Miss Costa Rica 
Johanna Solano, Miss France Laury Thilleman, Miss Portugal Laura 
Goncalves and Miss Panama Sheldry Saez.

As well as competing in categories 
ranging from swimsuits to evening gowns, the women also had to answer 
the critical question that tells the judges a bit about them.

In fan voting, Ms Lopes tallied only a 3.6 score for the swimsuit but earned a 7.2 for her evening gown. Fan voting, however, did not count in the final tallies from nine judges.

The panellists, who ranged from race 
car driver Helio Castroneves to actress Vivica A. Fox and journalist 
Connie Chung, scored the women on each contest, narrowing from a group 
of 16 down to a final five.

The show was hosted by U.S. television personalities Andy Cohen and Natalie Morales.

Out of the past 13 pageants held in 
the past decade, seven have been won by Latina contestants, making Miss 
Angola’s win even more exciting for her home country.

Miss Angola started competing in the 
Miss Universe competitions in 1998, with the first ever contestant from 
the African nation being Emilia Guardado.

Since 1997, two Miss Angolas have been
semi-finalists in the top 15 and one made it into the top 10, but Leila
Lopes is the first to be crowned with the title.
