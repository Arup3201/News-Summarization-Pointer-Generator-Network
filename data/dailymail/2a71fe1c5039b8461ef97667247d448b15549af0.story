A disturbing video of a union official verbally abusing a building inspector at a construction site in Adelaide has emerged at the Royal Commission into Trade Union Governance and Corruption.

The commission, which is looking into allegations against officials from the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (CFMEU), was shown the footage of union official John Perkovic yelling at Seamus Flynn, a Fair Work Building and Construction inspector.

Mr Perkovic can be heard repeatedly calling Mr Flynn a 'f***ing piece of s***' in the video, in which he also appears to touch Mr Flynn's stomach while saying 'look at this gut'.

The Royal Commission into Trade Union Governance and Corruption was shown a video of union official John Perkovic yelling at Seamus Flynn, a Fair Work Building and Construction inspector on Tuesday

During the verbal attack, Mr Perkovic stood inches from his victim's face and Mr Flynn could be heard saying 'get away from me' and 'don't touch me'.

Mr Perkovic: Do you want a f****** photo, you f****** piece of s***?

Mr Flynn: I'll take this further.

Fair Work Inspector Angeliek Peters: Just to let you know, this is being recorded.

Mr Perkovic: You gonna take it further. You're just about to have a heart attack, you're s******* yellow, you piece of s***.

Mr Flynn: I can...

Mr Perkovic: Go f***... and brush your teeth next time, you piece of s***, all right?

Mr Flynn: (Indistinct).

Ms Peters: This is being recorded so you're (indistinct).

Mr Perkovic: Oh yeah. Not a coward like you, you piece of s***.

Mr Flynn: Don't touch me.

Mr Perkovic: Look at this gut, hey.

Mr Flynn: Get away from me.

Mr Perkovic: Look at this gut.

Ms Peters: Guys, you knew that this was being recorded.

Mr Perkovic: Look at him.

Mr Flynn: Get away from me.

Mr Perkovic: He's using his gut, he's using his gut, the piece of s***. You f****** coward. I'd f****** take you to school, you f****** piece of s***

Mr Flynn has arrived to the building site to check reports that the union had entered without permits, AAP reports.

In his statement, Mr Flynn said Mr Perkovic 'quickly moved towards me, saying `you f****ing maggot, what are you taking a photo of me for you piece of s***'.

The video also shows Mr Perkovic saying: 'You f***ing coward, I'd f***ing take you to school, you f***ing piece of s***'.

CFMEU's national construction secretary Dave Noonan, addressed the video in a press release by saying: 'Swearing on building sites is nothing new and doesn't warrant a $53 million royal commission'.

Other inspectors have also reported to the commission that 'intimidation tactics' have been used against them by union officials, according to the ABC.

Matthew Barr claimed that eight officials confronted him at Sydney's Barangaroo construction site less than two months ago, while Jared O'Connor told the commission that a union official called him a 'grub' and announced his mobile phone number over a megaphone at the same site.

'The threat of violence through words or conduct such as to lead another to apprehend assault itself constitutes an assault, which is an offence punishable under the laws of both New South Wales and South Australia.' Counsel assisting the commission Jeremy Stoljar said, according to the ABC. 

The commission also looked into the deleting of numerous emails after it had sent letters to the CFMEU on May 30, demanding extensive records be supplied within one week, including any files relating to any enterprise bargaining agreements reached with companies operated by underworld-linked businessman George Alex.

Up to nine people worked to delete emails over three days at the branch, starting from June 23, 2014, to free up space on the email system and get it working again, Kylie Wray, general manager of the NSW branch of the CFMEU said.

She said she asked union staff to delete an unknown number of emails after a 'disk space error' caused a crash that stopped the branch receiving external emails and denied that she wanted to delete the emails which the commission wanted to see.

There had been no backup for the email system since a May 2010 firebombing of the union office.

CFMEU national construction secretary Dave Noonan said in a press release after the day's hearing that the union had complied with the commission's requests.

'There has been no attempt by anyone in the union to knowingly destroy documents relevant to the Royal Commission,' he said in the press release.

The hearing continues on Wednesday.
