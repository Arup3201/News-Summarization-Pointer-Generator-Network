Dani Osvaldo is poised to fly to Milan on Sunday ahead of finalising his loan to Inter. 

The Southampton striker has agreed terms and is waiting for Inter to agree a loan fee plus £6m permanent fee to follow. 

Ronald Koeman has spoken to Inter midfielder Saphir Taider who will move in the opposite direction, as reported in Sportsmail.

Koeman said: 'We are looking for the best for Osvaldo and the best for the club. Taider brings quality and we need that. We need competition in the squad as well and that will be good.'

Tottenham are expected to increase their offer for Morgan Schneiderlin, 24, over the weekend with the possibility players could also be offered in a deal.

Southampton have had an initial £12m bid for Sporting Lisbon's Argentine defender Marcos Rojo rejected.

Little Pea: Southampton are interested in United's Javier Hernandez but could face competition from Inter

The Saints are keen on signing Manchester United striker Javier Hernandez, but could face competition from Inter.

The south coast club can offer more cash up front but Hernandez would be keen to play European football if he left United.

The Mexican has been continually linked with a move away from Old Trafford and is currently on United's pre-season tour of the USA.
