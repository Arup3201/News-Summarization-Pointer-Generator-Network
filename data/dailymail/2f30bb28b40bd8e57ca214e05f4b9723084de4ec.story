A British lottery winner scooped a staggering £73million jackpot on last night’s EuroMillions draw.

It is the eighth highest lottery win in the UK – making the ticket holder richer than Formula One star Lewis Hamilton and level with Oasis musicians Noel and Liam Gallagher.

They will also outstrip the likes of comedian Rowan Atkinson, film director Sir Ridley Scott, and England footballer Wayne Rooney.

Last night’s winning numbers were 4, 30, 31, 38 and 42. The Lucky Star numbers were 2 and 11.

A British winner has won £73million on the Euromillions, the eighth highest in UK lottery history

A spokesman for Camelot confirmed this morning that nobody had come forward to collect the prize.

The spokesman told Mail Online: 'With the draw being at the weekend there's always the likelihood that people won't check their tickets immediately and will leave it until the start of the week.

'With this weekend being a bank holiday that is even more likely as they could be away from home and doing other things.

'So far nobody has come forward to claim the money so we are urging people to dig out their tickets and check because they could be sitting on a windfall.'

There was no indication last night where 
the winning ticket was bought, or who the winner was.

With that cash whoever the lucky winner is will be able to buy themselves 31 Lamborghini Veneno supercars at £2.3million each.

With £73million in your pocket, you could afford to buy yourself 73 Aston Martin One-77 supercars

You could also afford to dine out on 121,666 Zillion Dollar Frittatas. The £600 snack is sold at New York's Le Parker Meridien Hotel and contains 10 ounces of sevruga caviar

They will also be able to afford 121,666 Zillion Dollar Frittatas, officially the world's most expensive omlette, which is served up at Le Parker Meridien Hotel, New York and contains lobster and ten ounces of sevruga caviar.

Britain’s largest jackpot winners to date are Colin and Christine Weir, who won £161million on EuroMillions in 2011.

The couple, who have two children and had been married for 30 years when they won, reportedly bought a fleet of cars for their friends with the winnings, as well as a mansion.

But winning the lottery can have its downsides. Adrian and Gillian Bayford announced that they were divorcing because of the ‘stress’ of scooping £148million, the second highest ever jackpot.

Lottery operator Camelot has claimed only 2 per cent of winners had separated from their partners since winning a major prize.

The biggest UK Euromillion winners are Colin and Christine Weir, from Largs in Ayrshire

Adrian and Gillian Bayford vowed not to let the money change them when they scooped £148million, but have since separated, citing the stress the win put on their marriage

But Paddy O’Donnell, psychology professor at the University of Glasgow, has previously warned such a large windfall creates an ‘enormous disruptive effect’ which can change friendships and family relations.

He said winners experience an initial surge of happiness. But in a few months this would probably drop back to the level of contentment they felt before their windfall.

Mr O’Donnell said: ‘If you ask people how they would feel if they won the lottery, everybody says “I would be happy for the rest of my life”.’

But he added that, in reality, someone earning £25,000 a year would be more or less as happy as someone earning £250,000 a year.

The winning ticket-holder of last night's EuroMillions has shot to eight place on the National Lottery Rich List.

Here are the official top 10 biggest winners since the lottery began:

1. Colin and Chris Weir: £161,653,000

The husband and wife, from Largs in Ayrshire, said they were 'tickled pink' after becoming Europe's biggest lottery winners in July 2011

Married for 30 years and with two children, the life-changing £161 million prize catapulted them into the Sunday Times Rich List above Beatle Ringo Starr and Sir Tom Jones.

Colin and Chris Weir hold the EuroMillions record win and have reportedly bought a fleet of luxury cars for their friends and a mansion for themselves

Psychiatric nurse Mrs Weir, 55, and Mr Weir, 64, who worked as a TV cameraman and studio manager for 23 years, have reportedly bought a fleet of cars for friends since their win as well as a mansion.

2. Adrian and Gillian Bayford: £148,656,000

Children's nurse Gillian, 40, and record seller Adrian, 41, from Haverhill, Suffolk, said they planned to fork out on luxury holidays and cars when they won in August last year.

Adrian and Gillian Bayford scooped £148million last year and bought a Georgian mansion together, but have since split up and are now with other people

Adrian joked to his wife that he had not bought any tickets, before she told him to be quiet as she was trying to get their children to sleep as he celebrated the win. The couple have since separated.

4. Neil Trotter, 41: £107,932,603.20

Mr Trotter bought £10 worth of Lucky Dip tickets on Friday after getting a 'funny feeling' that he had to play while on the drive to work.

The winner, from Coulsdon, Surrey, is taking home £107,932,603.20, making him the 745th wealthiest person in the UK.

It also means he is worth more than celebrities such as George Michael and Robbie Williams (who both have £105million) and David Bowie (£100million), according to the latest Sunday Times Rich List.

5. Dave and Angela Dawes: £101,203,600

Dave Dawes, 47, a shift supervisor for Premier Foods, and Angela Dawes, 43, a volunteer for the British Heart Foundation, hit the EuroMillions jackpot in October 2011.

Dave and Angela Dawes went from living in a one-bedroom flat in Wisbech to a £9million country pile in Surrey after their win, but split up after arguing over how to split the money between their friends

It was only the third time the couple, from Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, had played the lottery.

The skydiving enthusiast, who lived in a three-bedroom semi near Cirencester, Wiltshire, married his girlfriend Justine, 42, and moved into a mansion in the Cotswolds.

It was reported that he paid ex-wife Wendy, 43, £2million after she made a legal claim for £8million. The pair had separated 10 years before his bumper win.
