A jealous boyfriend who bit through his girlfriend's lip in a vicious attack when she ended their relationship has been jailed for eight years.

Chanttelle Ward, 18, was convinced her top lip had come off when Rhys Culley, of South Shields, Tyneside, bit her after going in for a kiss and asking if she loved him during the prolonged and violent attack.

Newcastle Crown Court heard how 23-year-old Culley had been jealous and insecure about what his girlfriend of more than two years was up to while he was working away when he launched the attack.

Miss Ward and Culley had been together for more than two years when the attack occurred on February 22

During the trial, jurors saw pictures of angry teeth marks in Miss Ward's upper lip. They also heard how Culley smeared his victim's own blood around her face and forced his tongue in her mouth during the attack on February 22.

The shopfitter, who had been in a relationship with Miss Ward for over two years, denied wounding with intent but was found guilty in September. He returned to court today to be sentenced and was jailed for eight years.

Recorder Caroline Wigin told him: 'The relationship was about to have pressure placed on it because of your departure for a job in the Shetland Isles.

'You showed mounting and unwarranted jealousy towards Miss Ward, demanding to see messages on her phone and you then began to assault her.

'You slapped her, you threatened to hit her with a vodka bottle and chased her around the house, throwing her across the sofa.

'You punched her in the face.

'This part of the evening took approximately one hour and in my opinion if formed part of a sustained assault on her.

'You asked her if you were still in a relationship. On her answer you were no longer in a relationship you threw her on the bed and pinned her down.

'You lent down and bit sideways onto her top lip.

'I consider you have caused a very significant disfigurement to this young lady.'

The court heard that Miss Ward was left so traumatised after the attack that she needed counselling and has been left with permanent scars.

Jurors heard Culley bit down on the her lip with the same force that would be needed to bite through a 1cm thick piece of rubber.

As well as the gruesome and 'very deep' injury to her mouth, Miss Ward had bruising and scratches to her head and body after the attack.

She told jurors during the trial that Culley had tried to kiss her and asked her if she still loved him before the bite.

She said: 'He put his whole mouth around my lips and pulled, I thought that my whole lip had come off.

'There was blood everywhere.'

The court heard the attack happened at Miss Ward's home after a night out on February 22.

Prosecutor Emma Dowling said that after Culley had bitten his victim, he 'rubbed his face in hers, smearing the blood across her face and then he stuck his tongue into her mouth'.

She added: 'When the police arrived they saw that they both had blood on them and over their faces.'

Culley was arrested and Miss Ward was taken to hospital to have her injuries examined.

She suffered not only the injuries to her mouth, but bruising to her arms and body, a scratch to her left breast and bruising of the face and ear.

During his evidence, Culley said he did not mean to harm his 'beautiful' girlfriend, who he knew he was lucky to have.

At the sentence hearing, the public gallery was packed with his friends, family and supporters and the judge was given more than 20 references from people who know him.

The judge said she accepted Culley was ordinarily a 'reliable and helpful' young man who did not pose a risk to the general public before jailing him for eight years.
