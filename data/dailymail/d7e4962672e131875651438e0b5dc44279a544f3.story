Manny Pacquiao was up at the crack of dawn on Wednesday morning as he continued to put in the groundwork ahead of his fight against Floyd Mayweather Jnr.

Joined by a large entourage and a Jack Russell Terrier called Pacman, Pacquiao was pounding the streets of Los Angeles at 5.30am on day three of his training camp.

Pacquiao has a little more than eight weeks to get himself down to the 147lb welterweight limit for the $300million (£200m) mega-fight in Las Vegas on May 2

Pacquiao's preparations started at home in the Philippines before he flew to Los Angeles last Sunday. 

The 36-year-old is currently training without his mentor Freddie Roach who is in Macao to corner Zou Shiming as he bids to win his first world title at flyweight.

'Manny told me I should be with Zou because he knows how important this fight is for him,' Roach told ESPN. 'The thing is, Manny is that type of guy. He cares about other people. He knows Shiming has a better chance to win if I'm there with him.'

In Roach's absence, Pacquiao is working with assistant trainer Marvin Somodio and childhood friend Buboy Fernandez.

And on Wednesday he was seen jogging with several members of his team before spending a short time shadow boxing and stretching off.

Both Pacquiao and Mayweather have kept fans updated with their progress via social media by posting pictures and video of their training sessions, although the finer details of their game plans will be worked on away from the cameras.

Only one press conference will be held in the build-up, next Wednesday in Los Angeles, as both men come face to face for the final time before fight week.
