Samuel Henley, 33, who lives in Liverpool, was convicted of six counts of making indecent photos of children

A former teacher at Gordonstoun, the boarding school attended by Prince Charles, who was sacked after downloading child abuse images has been banned from the profession.

Samuel Henley, 33, who lives in Liverpool, was convicted of six counts of making indecent photos of children and given a two year-conditional discharge in February.

The maths teacher at the £32,000-a-year Gordonstoun, in Moray, Scotland, was also placed on the sex offenders' register.

At a Fitness to Teach hearing held by the General Teaching Council for Scotland (GTCS) a panel decided Henley, the son of a barrister, was unfit to teach.

Henley, who now helps to run three branches of the artisan Baltic Bakehouse in Liverpool, did not attend the hearing and was removed from the teaching register.

In February, Chester Crown Court heard officials at the school sacked Henley after detectives swooped on a property near Sefton Park in Liverpool, in 2010.

British officers were acting on a tip from police in the Netherlands who were investigating child abuse images being shared among paedophiles on the file sharing website GigaTribe.

In a statement after the fitness to teach hearing, the GTCS panel said: 'The conviction in this case is of the gravest kind.

'There has been no evidence provided about the whether the behaviour could be remedied.

'In the context of being a teacher, this conduct is not capable of being remedied.

'The behaviour is incompatible with being a registered teacher and a finding of unfitness is necessary in order to protect the public interest.'

If Henley wanted to return to the classroom he would have to re-apply to the GTCS and face another hearing.

The panel ruled Henley would not be able to re-apply for two years.

During his time at Gordonstoun, Prince Charles has complained that he was bullied, punched as he slept and saw friends tortured with pliers and the Queen Mother pleaded for him to be moved.

The school, whose motto is 'there is more in you', was also attended by the Duke of Edinburgh, Prince Andrew and Prince Edward.

There are around 600 pupils aged 13-18 who each live in nine boarding houses.

It was founded in 1934 by German educator Kurt Hahn and is named after the 17th century 150-acre estate owned by Sir Robert Gordon, a historian and Scottish courtier.

There is no indication that any of the children depicted in Henley's stash of child pornography had any links to the school.

Henley was contacted at one of his bakeries but refused to comment on the teaching ban.

Gordonstoun was founded in 1934 by Dr Kurt Hahn

Dr Hahn had fled Germany in 1933 and initially started a school with three pupils 

The next year pupil numbers increased and he signed a lease with the Gordon-Cumming family for the Gordonstoun estate

Today the school sits in 200 acres and has primary and secondary facilities

It is one of the last remaining full boarding schools, and houses 600 male and female pupils 

Prince Charles was a pupil at the school in the 1960s 

Other royal alumni include Prince Edward, who was head boy in 1982, and Zara Phillips 

Prince Andrew went to the school in the 1970s and became known for his hockey skills 

Prince Philip also went to Gordonstoun in the 1930s
