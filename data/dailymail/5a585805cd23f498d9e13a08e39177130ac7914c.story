A desperate father is trying to do everything in his power to protect his daughter from a man he believes will sexually assault her - his stepson. 

Carl Sumner of Boca Raton, Florida, claims he walked in on his then 12-year-old stepson as he was sexually assaulting his four-year-old stepsister back in 2010, this after hearing the girl crying from another room. 

Now, following this incident, Sumner wants to know why his ex-wife and the mother of these two children, along with the state, are allowing them to have contact with one another.

'It was the most horrific thing I had ever witnessed in my life,' Sumner told FoxNews.com of walking in on the alleged assault. 

'There's no question as to what happened to my daughter and when it happened. I saw it. I heard her crying.'

Hi ex-wife and the mother, Danielle Rowe, does not dispute what happened.

After the incident, the young boy was not charged but underwent psychiatric evaluation and spent subsequent years in group homes.

Now, Rowe says she just wants her family to heal while she believes Sumner is trying to destroy them.

'He [Sumner] wanted my son charged for attempted murder and put on death row,' Rowe said. 

'He wants to destroy a 12-year-old who made a mistake.'

Vanessa Prieto, who is Rowe's attorney, says the mother is following all the necessary safety measures and precautions when her son does visit, making sure that he and his stepsister are never alone.

That, however, is still not enough for Sumner, who has been vigilant and maybe even gone too far in order to try and protect his children.

Prieto claims Sumner filed 'numerous false domestic violence claims about my client which have all been dismissed' and sent 'indecent and improper threats' to Rowe.

Full custody: Rowe (above) was granted full custody of her daughter after he ex-husband, Carl Sumner, took her and her brother to North Carolina for nine months, keeping them out of school

He also took his two children, his now eight-year-old daughter and her twin brother into hiding in North Carolina for nine months, during which time they did not attend school.

Following this incident, Rowe was granted full custody, though she did allow Sumner to visit with his children, even unsupervised, until the court stepped in  and said he should not be around the children.

A court-appointed guardian testified that Sumner was 'a danger, possibly physically and definitely mentally, and a flight risk,' according to Prieto.

At one point he wrote a message calling his stepson a future 'serial killer' and saying that the boy wanted to turn his 'little daughter into his "superslut."'

A page seeking justice for his young daughter was also created at one point as well that called his estranged wife a 'pedophile' and a 'psychopath.'

'It’s very sad,' says Sumner's former attorney, Katherine Corrigan.

'He’s a good dad. He absolutely loves his kids and will do anything to protect them.'
