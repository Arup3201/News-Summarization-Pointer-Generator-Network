Whether visiting family abroad, on a business trip or jetting off for a exotic holiday, baggage allowances can be the bane of a traveller's journey.

Nudging a kilo over the 15kg or 20kg restrictions could end up in a £45 fee.

So no doubt the TUL self-weighing suitcase will be welcomed with open arms.

Pack it in! The suitcase has hidden sensors which translate the contents weight onto a side screen

End of painful excess luggage charges?Shut the suitcase lid and press a button to see its weight

Designed by TUL Thustrelie, a Brisbane-based company, the concept is currently aiming to raise money on crowdfunding website Kickstarter.

The Australian venture will be made if it receives $95,000 (£53,000).

Suitcases that weigh  luggage are not a new concept - with cases available to buy that allow travellers to weigh the contents after zipping it up and lifting it by the handle. 

An end to luggage woes? The new case weighs items as they are packed into it

Measuring 64cm x 42cm x 25cm, it comes with jacket to protect the lock and LCD screen from damage

The TUL goes one stage further. It can weigh items inside the suitcase as you are filling it, saving you the hassle of zipping it up, weighing it, unzipping it, taking a few items out, zipping it up, weighing it and so on.

An external impact protection jacket to protect the sensors, LCD screen and luggage lock from potential damage while you are on the move and an in-built weighing scale that feeds its findings to a small screen at the side.

To weigh the contents close the suitcase lid  and, without having to entirely enclose the zips, press a  button to  tell you how much the insides weigh.

Design team behind TUL suitcase are waiting to see if they have enough fund to make the product 

Sensors are installed at the base of the suitcase to figure out the weight while hidden electronics convert it into a reading in kilograms on a small screen.

It incorporates the weight of the empty suitcase into its reading, so gives a more accurate reading of what would appear on the scales at check-in.

The weighing scale is powered by a rechargeable external battery pack. 

On its Kickstarter page, the company says: 'TUL is a suitcase with a built-in weighing function.

'Simply close the lid of the designated suitcase, and without having to entirely enclose the zips, the press of a single button will let you know the weight of your luggage.'
