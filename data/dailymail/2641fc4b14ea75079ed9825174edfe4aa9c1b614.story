Angry villagers: Residents of Whitemans Green, Cuckfield, West Sussex staged a 'booze in' in their local supermarket to protest plans to turn the 200-year-old Ship Inn pub into a Co-op

Dozens of residents showed their disapproval by buying pints from another pub nearby and taking them into existing Co-Op where they milled around drinking.

They say their village will be damaged if the only boozer gets turned into their second mini-supermarket.

The anti-Co-op collective is run by Jamie Oliver's favourite barbecue cook DJ BBQ Christian Stevenson, 46.

He masterminded the idea to gather 40 fellow boozers to peacefully sup a pint in the village Co-op as a defiant act of 'revenge.'

Mr Stevenson and his fellow residents gathered at the Co-op to protest plans to convert the 200-year-old pub into a shop.

Mr Stevenson said: 'The Co-op has unethically taken over our pub so we are taking over the Co-op.

'We want to shame the Co-op. They are stealing our local pub. 

'The pub has been there for 200 years, and now it's being turned into something that will irreparably damage our village life. 

 If the scheme goes ahead, there will be two Co-op shops within three-quarters of a mile.

Mr Stevenson, who goes under the name DJ BBQ, is one of celeb chef Jamie's contributors to his Food Tube series of culinary videos. 

The 200-year-old Ship Inn is the only pub in the village. If the scheme goes ahead, there will be two Co-op shops within three-quarters of a mile

'The pub is the heart and soul of the village, and we don't have another drinking hole.

More importantly, it's also going to threaten our local shop, Wealden Stores.

'They source everything from local pieman, butchers, you can't get more local than them, and it's got a post office. We want to keep local businesses thriving.'

The village's campaign to save The Ship Inn has even received the backing of their local MP, Sir Nicholas Soames.

The Tory MP for Mid Sussex has written to Co-op opposing their proposals, and even raised the issue in the House of Commons on Monday, in an address to pubs minister Kris Hopkins.

Sir Nicholas said: 'Is my Honourable friend aware of the serial bad behaviour by the Co-op in my constituency and others in the south, where it is taking over pubs and converting them into shops, often on very unsatisfactory sites?

'The Ship Inn in Cuckfield in my constituency is uniquely badly placed to serve as a Co-op.

'Will he look at what he can do to review the article 4 direction scheme, and to give general instructions about where such shops should be sited?'

Petitioners and Sir Nicholas are also appealing to Mid Sussex District Council to issue an immediate Article 4 order on the pub - which could force the owners to apply for planning permission to change the pub into a supermarket. 

 Kris Hopkins MP said: 'The article 4 direction scheme is strong, and it gives councils the opportunity to intervene.

'I know that there is a passionate campaign to support The Ship Inn.

'I would welcome the opportunity to meet the campaigners, and I will try to support them where I can.'

However, planning bosses at the council have decided to let the Ship sink, because they fell it is unfair to force the Co-op to apply for planning permission.

Thumbs down: More than 1,200 people signed the petition calling for Co-op to back down 

Councillor Norman Webster said: 'We understand the frustration of local people at the Coop's ability to convert the Ship Inn without the need for a planning application but an Article 4 Direction is not the answer in this case.'

More than 1,200 people have signed the petition calling for Co-op to back down from their proposals, but the supermarket chain are standing firm.

A spokesperson for The Co-operative Food said: 'Given that the developer has decided to convert the Ship to a convenience store, we - as a long established retailer in Cuckfield - have submitted proposals to open a new food store in a bid to greatly improve the shopping experience for the people of the village.

'If we were to open the proposed new store it would include a bakery, an excellent fresh food department including meat, fruit and vegetables, and a community information area.'
