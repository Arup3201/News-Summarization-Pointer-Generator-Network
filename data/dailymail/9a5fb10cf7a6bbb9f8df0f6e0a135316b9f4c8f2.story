State police in New York say an Albany man was high on drugs when he called 911 to report that his vehicle had been sideswiped on a highway.

Police say 38-year-old Malcolm Sidbury was driving south on the Taconic Parkway in Columbia County on Wednesday when he told dispatchers his car had been hit by another vehicle that didn't stop.

Troopers spotted the vehicles and stopped both.

Upon interviewing the other driver, Thomas R Robbins, 57, of Poughkeepsie, police determined he was drunk.

Police say Robbins' blood-alcohol content was .25 per cent, more than three times the legal limit.

Sidbury was also interviewed, and found to be under the influence of drugs.

According to the Daily Freeman, Robbins was charged with drunken driving, aggravated unlicensed operation of a motor vehicle and leaving the scene of a property-damage accident, all misdemeanors.

He also was charged with numerous vehicle and traffic law violations.

Sidbury was charged with driving while impaired by drugs.

Police said Sidbury was in the right lane when Robbins attempted to pass him, sideswiping his vehicle without stopping.

Both men were issued tickets. The district attorney's office said it doesn't have attorney information for either man.

The men will appear in Livingston Town Court.
