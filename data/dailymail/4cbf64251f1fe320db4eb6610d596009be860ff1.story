He's a man of few words, but what Seattle Seahawks running back Marshawn Lynch, 27, lacks in conversation he more than makes up for in dance moves.

During the post-match press-conference, the famously taciturn player uttered a few sentences - and then chose to express his joy over the team's victory through the medium of dance.

Wearing a red hoodie, matching sweat pants, black cap, gold 
headphones and with a black scarf covering his mouth, Lynch plugged his 
iPod into some speakers and turned up the volume on 'Ready 2 Ride' by 
Oakland rapper Philthy Rich.

Then 'Beast Mode' began dancing: dancing 
alone, like no one was watching. The joyful movements probably expressed
 Lynch's feelings better than any words could.

And he had every reason to celebrate: He scored a touchdown for his team in the second quarter of the game. The Seahawks stormed home beating the Denver Broncos decisively, 43 to eight.

Lynch's
 reluctance to speak to the media is well documented. In 2013, he was 
fined $50,000 for refusing to speak to the media throughout the 2013 NFL
 season.

The NFL later agreed not to collect the fee as long as Lynch promised to comply with the league's media policies going forward - failure to do so will result in a $100,000 fine.

Not shy: Lynch's reticence has nothing to day with introversion

He did manage a few words yesterday - 43, to be precise - but Lynch has always been a man who believes actions speak louder than words.

During the pre-Super Bowl Media Day, he managed six minutes on the podium answering reporters questions before bolting.

Later, NFL media's Deion Sanders managed to corner him as he made his getaway and the two had a one-on-one in which Lynch made his feelings on idle chatter clear.

'I ain't never seen no talking winning nothing. Been like that since I was little. I was raised like that,' he said.

'I'm gonna get it. Don't need to talk about it.'

The Pro Football Writers of America did not agree.

'Several of our long-standing and high profile members were appalled by Mr Lynch's conduct and refusal to answer any questions,' the statement read, per ProFootballTalk.

Seahawks coach Pete Carroll wasn't concerned.

'I heard he did a great six minutes,' Seahawks coach Pete Carroll said, reports NFL.com. 'Some comedians make a career off of that.'

The NFL agrees: 'Players are required to participate and he participated,' NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy said.

And the 43 words?

On winning the Super Bowl: 'Dream come true.'

On that touchdown run: 'Kicked it all off, boss.'

On him not celebrating on the field: 'Man, [my teammates] know how I feel about it. This is big time. This has been a tradition since I came, since forever. It's just what I do. Everybody knows it. They respect it.'

On if it's the best day of his life: 'Next to being born.'

Lynch, the Seattle Seahawks' running back, is notoriously taciturn

The fine was lifted but will be doubled if he does not comply with NFL participation rules in future

If his dance did not accurately convey his feelings about the Seahawks' victory, he did express them in words: 'Dream come true,' he said
