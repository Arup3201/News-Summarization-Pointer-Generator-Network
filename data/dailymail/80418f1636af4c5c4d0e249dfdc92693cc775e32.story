David Coleman, a BBC sports presenter and commentator with almost 50 years of service, has died after a brief illness.

His family confirmed his passing, saying: 'We regret to announce the death of David Coleman OBE, after a short illness. He died peacefully with his family at his bedside.'

The legendary figure presented some of the Corporation's most iconic programmes in his time behind the camera, including Grandstand, Sportsnight and A Question of Sport, which he hosted for 18 years.

The renowned athletics commentator worked for the corporation for almost 50 years, covering 11 summer Olympic Games, his final one in Sydney in 2000.

He also covered six football World Cups as a commentator or presenter.

Mr Coleman's humorous turns of phrase were regularly documented in a column in Private Eye magazine, and are remembered fondly to this day.

Some of the standout examples include:

'If that had gone in it would have been a goal'

'He is one of the great unknown champions because very little is known about him.'

'We estimate, and this isn't an estimation, that Greta Waltz is 80 seconds behind.'

'He is accelerating all the time. The last lap was run in 64 seconds and the one before in 62.'

'He's even smaller in real life than he is on the track.'

'He's got his hands on his knees and holds his head in despair.'

'He is 31 this year - last year he was 30.'

'And the line-up for the final of the women's 400 metres hurdles includes three Russians, two East Germans, a Pole, a Swede and a Frenchman.'

'The Republic of China: back in the Olympic Games for the first time.'

'That's the fastest time ever run, but it's not as fast as the world record.'

'There is a fine line between serendipity and stalking.'

'Don’t tell those coming in the final result of that fantastic match, but let’s just have another look at Italy’s winning goal.'

'For those of you watching who do not have television sets, live commentary is on Radio 2.'

'It’s gold or nothing…and it’s nothing. He comes away with the silver medal.'

'Forest have now lost six matches without winning.'

'And here’s Moses Kiptanui – the 19-year-old Kenyan who turned 20 a few weeks ago.'

'The front wheel crosses the finish line, closely followed by the back wheel.'

'This evening is a very different evening from the morning we had this morning.'

'I think there is no doubt, she'll probably qualify for the final.'

'A truly international field, no Britons involved.'

'He just can’t believe what’s not happening to him.'

'In a moment we hope to see the pole vault over the satellite.'

'Nobody has ever won the title twice before. He has already done that.'

'Both of the Villa scorers – Withe and Mortimer – were born in Liverpool as was the Villa manager Ron Saunders who was born in Birkenhead.'

'The late start is due to the time.'

In his lengthy broadcasting career, Mr Coleman became famous for making nonsensical or bizarre statements on air while covering live events, which later became lovingly known as 'Colemanballs'.

Some of the most famous instances include: 'That's the fastest time ever run, but it's not as fast as the world record.' and 'He is one of the great unknown champions because very little is known about him.'

Mr Coleman had Irish parents but was born and educated in Cheshire.

He worked as a reporter for a time on the Stockton Express newspaper, and joined the BBC after a period of national service.

He made his first television appearance in 1955 on Sportsview, and three years later he was taken on as the presenter of Grandstand, a new Saturday afternoon sports programme.

He would continue to present the show until 1968, and took the lead on the Sports Review of the Year programme from 1961 to 1983. He also put in a four-year stint on Sportsnight with Coleman between 1968 and 1972.

From 1979 to 1997 he hosted sports quiz show A Question of Sport.

In 1992 he was granted the OBE in the New Year’s Honours List, and four years later he received the Judges’ Award For Sport in the 1996 Royal Television Society Awards.

His excited, high-pitched commentaries made him a favourite among viewers but also a target for impersonators.

His professionalism as a broadcaster was widely acknowledged after his efforts covering the 1972 Munich Olympics.

During the games, Arab terrorists invaded the Olympic Village and took hostage and killed 11 Israeli athletes. Mr Coleman continued broadcasting during the tragedy and was praised for his professionalism.

His work at Grandstand, particularly his feats of memory and mind for football league statistics, were also widely praised.

Mr Coleman
 ran this immensely complex live four-and-a-half-hour programme for nine years.

He told one interviewer that each Grandstand involved 
him in 16 hours of preparation, checking records and memorising league
 tables.

This meant that as the dozens of soccer results poured out, 
from a teleprinter in those days, Mr Coleman would demonstrate his 
expertise about even the obscure byways of League football.

However he retained a fondness for the light-hearted side of sports broadcasting. He later jokingly recalled his role on the programme, saying: 'I just sit 
there and generally take the mickey.'

He
 was awarded an OBE in the 1993 New Year's Honours, and later a special 
accolade in the Royal Television Society presentations, when the judges 
called him 'the pivotal voice of BBC sport for over five decades'.

After hosting the 2000 Sydney Olympics, he received the Olympic movement's highest accolade, the Olympic Order, in recognition of his services to the spirit and ideals of the Games.

He is survived by his wife Barbara, and their six children, Anne – a British ladies show jumping champion – Dean, David, Mandy, Michael and Samantha.

Today former colleagues and friends paid tribute to Mr Coleman, praising him as 'one of the this country's greatest and most respected broadcasters.'

Former BBC colleague Barry Davies said Mr Coleman was 'the master who set the standard for sports broadcasting on television'.

Mr Davies said: 'He had such authority in his voice which could bring even the most mundane event to life. And at the big events he was superb.

'I feel privileged to have known him, worked with him and occasionally stood in for him when he was in his prime.'

Barbara Slater, director of 
sport and the BBC, said: 'David Coleman was a giant in the sports broadcasting 
world, an iconic and hugely respected figure.

'In
 a BBC career that spanned over 40 years he set the standard that so 
many others have tried to emulate.

'His was one of broadcasting's most 
authoritative and identifiable voices that graced so many pinnacle 
sporting moments.

'From his 
famous football and athletic commentaries to his presentation of events 
and programmes such as the Olympics, the World Cup, A Question of Sport 
and Grandstand, he was quite simply the master of his craft.

'David had many friends at BBC Sport and was admired by audiences in their millions. We send sincere condolences to his family.'

Tony Hall, the director-general of the BBC, said: 'David Coleman was one of this country's greatest and most respected broadcasters.

'Generations grew up listening to his distinctive and knowledgeable commentary. Whether presenting, commentating or offering analysis, he set the standard for all today's sports broadcasters.

'Our thoughts are with his family and many friends.'

Former England striker and Match of the Day presenter Gary Lineker joined those remembering Mr Coleman - whose brevity at the microphone, including his signature 'one-nil' catchphrase, earned him many fans.

The former Leicester, Everton, Tottenham and Barcelona forward wrote on Twitter: 'Sad to hear, David Coleman has died. A giant of sports broadcasting. Brilliant, gifted, precise and concise. Much more than "one-nil" #RIP'

Fellow sports host Jake Humphrey added on Twitter: 'RIP David Coleman. People like me do this job dreaming one day we'll be as good as you were. We won't. Never to be bettered.'

Prime Minister David Cameron also offered a tribute, writing on Twitter that Mr Coleman was 'the voice of BBC Sport for as long as I can remember.'
