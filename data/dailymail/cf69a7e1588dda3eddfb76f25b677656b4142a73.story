The wealthy scion who allegedly gave John Edwards over $700,000 which was used to hide a love-child from his dying wife has spoken for the first time.

In the first interview for a quarter century, 100-year-old Rachel 'Bunny' Mellon said her sympathies lay with Edwards, and not his dead wife Elizabeth.

Speaking to Newsweek, the blind and reclusive Mrs Mellon - who has an estimated $400 million fortune - said the former North Carolina senator, 'would have been a great president'.

Money from Mellon - who will turn 101 in
 August - is at the centre of Edwards' criminal charges as it is alleged
 that he used the finances she gave him as hush money.

Bunny Mellon is the eldest child of Gerard Barnes Lambert who rose to fame and wealth after marketing his father's invention Listerene.

Her second marriage to banking heir Paul Mellon in 1948 cemented her status as a member of American high society.

In fact so gilded was Mrs Mellon, that The Washington Post once pronounced her the 'Most Envied Hostess in the Country Today'.

Her marriage to Paul Mellon was an odd one however, with 'Bunny' sleeping in a separate bed to her husband, who was notorious for his dalliances with other women.

Living a life that revolved around art, horses and the social scene, the couple were well known for entertaining British royalty at their farm in Virginia as well as their close friendship with John and Jacqueline Kennedy.

Mrs Mellon was so close to the First Lady that she was invited to redesign the White House Rose Garden and also began work on the White House’s East Garden.

A keen gardener, she was brought in to make floral arrangements for JFK’s funeral, and remained a close confidant of Jackie’s until her death.

Tragedy struck in May 2000 when her daughter Eliza Lloyd, was struck by a truck as she crossed a Manhattan street.

Left with severe brain damage and rendered a paraplegic, Eliza was cared for at her mother’s farm until she died eight years later.

The disgraced politician is said to 
have turned to Mrs Mellon to request financial support after he 
allegedly visited her sprawling Virginia estate for lunch - just as his 
attorneys were in last-minute talks with the Justice Department.

Talking up their relationship to Newsweek, Mrs Mellon said of her friendship with Edwards: 'He and I were great friends.

'Every time he’d go on a debate against Hillary (Clinton), he’d call and we’d talk.'

Mrs Mellon, lives on her sprawling 2,000 acre Virginia farm with 120 servants and retainers, added she was: 'So surprised when this thing came up.'

Her lawyer Alex Forger added his client: 'Was not enamoured of his wife and didn’t want his wife to know that he was getting money.'

Mrs Mellon first came into contact with Edwards when ran for vice president in 2004.

Impressed with the handsome senator, she began sending campaign contributions during his subsequent run for president in 2005 and 
2006.

Also speaking to Newsweek, other members of the Mellon family were less kind to Edwards, with Mrs Mellon's grandson Thomas Lloyd, 35, saying: 'I
 wish I could have 10 minutes in a room with John Edwards to explain 
that he’s doing nothing but tarnish her legacy and really taking 
advantage of her.

'As I 
explained to the jury, imagine a very handsome man who is well liked and
 respected, and there are two women vying for his affections.

'He’s done a very good job of 
maintaining the sense that ‘Bunny, I want to be your friend; Bunny, feel
 sorry for me in this predicament, we’ll get through this together.''

'I think it’s awful.'

In teh Newsweek article, 'Bunny' added she was drawn to Edwards': 'Very deep intelligence.

'He was wise, he was clear, he was a very good person. I don’t like complicated people.'

Acting on her belief in Edwards, Mrs Mellon began financially bankrolling the former senator after he was famously attacked for having a $400 hair cut.

The subsequent indictment noted Mrs Mellon as: 'I was sitting alone in a grim mood, furious that the press attacked Senator Edwards on the price of a haircut.

'But it inspired me. ‘From now on, all haircuts, etc., that are important for his campaign, please send the bills to me.

'It is a way to help our friend without government restrictions.''

Earlier this year, a source who spoke to ABC news 
claimed that the amount given by Mrs Mellon was definitely in the millions of dollars.

According to the indictment, Edwards' former campaign finance chairman Fred Baron donated  $200,000 while Mrs Mellon gave $725,000.

That money was used to pay for Edwards's mistress Reille Hunter's living and medical expenses and for chartered airfare, luxury hotels, furniture and rental for a house in Santa Barbara, California, to keep her and the couple's love child Quinn, now three, hidden from the public, it added.

It was Edwards' former aide Andrew 
Young who came out and claimed that the money was being used as hush 
money - after originally covering for the disgraced politician.

He has said that Edwards agreed in 2007 to solicit money directly from Mrs Mellon and claimed he received hundreds of thousands of dollars in cheques from the heiress - some even hidden in boxes of chocolates.

Mistress: The government are alleging that at 
least $925,000 was given to Reille Hunter as hush money instead of 
pumped into his campaign

The
case filed against the 57-year-old, contains six counts, including 
conspiracy, four counts of illegal campaign contributions and one count 
of false statements.

Edwards
did not have to post bond at his arraignment, but he had to surrender 
his passport and is not allowed to leave the continental U.S.

One of the conditions of his release from custody was that he have no further direct or indirect contact with Mrs Mellon.
