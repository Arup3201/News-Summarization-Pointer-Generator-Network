A talented young opera singer left without a penny of his father's £2 million fortune has won a court payout to fund his music career - as long as he gets into a prestigious college. 

Miles Taylor, from Leeds, was just 17 when his father, Rochdale businessman, Peter Gardiner, died aged 56 in 2006, making 'no provision' for him in his will.

Mr Gardiner left £350,000 to charity and put the rest of his money into a trust fund from which his illegitimate son was specifically 'excluded'.

Opera singer Miles Taylor, 25, was left without a penny of his father's fortune but will win a payout to fund his career - as long as he gets into the Royal College of Music (pictured), or the Guildhall School of Music

But now a high court judge has effectively overruled Mr Gardiner and ordered that should Mr Taylor be accepted into either the Royal College of Music, or the Guildhall School of Music, his father's estate must foot part of the bill.  

The teenager excelled in music at Harrogate College and went on to study at the Leeds College of Music and the Royal Northern College of Music in Manchester.

He has now applied to the elite London institutions as part of his post-graduate studies.  

The executors of Mr Gardiner's estate had bitterly opposed the singer receiving any of the money.

They even argued that Mr Taylor, now 25, 'did not have the musical talent' to succeed and that he was 'irresponsible with money', the court heard.

However, Judge John Behrens rejected both those suggestions, describing Mr Taylor as a 'keen, talented and committed' singer with good prospects.

His mother, Christine Taylor, told the court he had been passionate about singing since the age of 10 and thirsted for success on the opera stage.

Judge Behrens, sitting at the High Court, rejected suggestions that Mr Taylor 'did not have the musical talent; to succeed, describing him as a 'keen, talented and committed' singer with good prospects

He had 'specific learning difficulties' but even a 2008 road accident - in which he suffered severe chest and internal injuries - had not held him back from achieving his ambition.

Despite being cut off by his father, Mr Taylor sought 'reasonable provision' from his estate as a dependent.

The executors pointed out that the estate had already paid more than £110,000 towards his maintenance and education costs.

However, Judge Behrens ruled it was only right that Mr Taylor's post-graduate studies should be posthumously funded by his father.

He was granted £6,500 from the estate to cover his student costs in 2015 and another £15,000 for the next two years.

However, the judge said he would only get the £15,000 if accepted onto a post-graduate course.

That, the court heard, will depend on how well Mr Taylor does in auditions due at the end of this month.

According to online records, Mr Gardiner was born in 1949 and was a director of Oldham Security Accessories Limited and Gardiner Fire Limited.
