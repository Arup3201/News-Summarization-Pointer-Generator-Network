New York Governor Andrew Cuomo's youngest daughter was briefly hospitalized after she was found unconscious in her home earlier this week.

Michaela Kennedy Cuomo, 17, was found in the Westchester home she shares with her mother, Kerry Kennedy, on Wednesday evening. 

She was taken to Westchester Medical Center where she was treated and released.

A Bedford Police Department spokesman confirmed that officers responded to a medical emergency at the address and transported one person from the home to the hospital, according to the New York Daily News. 

The office of Gov. Cuomo was unavailable to comment. 

Michaela Cuomo is the youngest daughter of Gov. Cuomo and Kerry Kennedy. She has older twin sisters, Cara and Mariah, aged 20. 

Her parents were married for 13 years before divorcing in 2003. Her father now lives with his longtime girlfriend, TV chef Sandra Lee.

The teenager has been active in the political community in recent years, with her latest endeavor delving into awareness of sexual assault. 

Last month she sold T-shirts that read, 'My having a good a** does not give you the right to be one', and gave proceeds to the Robert F Kennedy Center for Justice and Human Rights. 

In 2014 Michaela Cuomo lobbied democratic former New York Sen. Cecilia Tkaczyk to reverse her position on the Farmworkers Fair Labor Practices Act.
