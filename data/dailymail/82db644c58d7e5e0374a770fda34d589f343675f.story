Hundreds of people were unexpectedly swept off their feet when the world's largest tidal bore surged up a river and blasted a gigantic wave over the bank. 

The shocked onlookers were standing on the banks of the Qiantang River in China's Zhejiang province when the monster wave struck yesterday. 

The 'trumpet-shaped' mouth of the Qiantang, which sees large waves created by incoming tides from the East China Sea, is though to be the biggest in the world and can generate waves up to 11.5 feet high.

Tidal bores can be seen in several locations around the world, including the Britain's longest river, the Severn, but the Qiantang bore is the largest

A tidal bore happens when a fast-rising tide is funneled by a river into an upstream wave.

Tidal bores can be seen in several locations around the world, including the Britain's longest river, the Severn, but the Qiantang bore is the largest.

Every year, millions of people flock to see it on the 18th day of the eight lunar month. 

In August last year, more than 30 people were injured by the tidal bore, which was given extra force by Typhoon Trami.

As well as knocking over spectators, the wave dragged off vehicles and flooded a water-treatment plant.
