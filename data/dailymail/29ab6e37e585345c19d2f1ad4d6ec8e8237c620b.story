He can overcome any obstacle on screen with ease, but George Clooney must have been daunted by his latest real-life challenge: meeting his mother-in-law to be.

But, strolling through the airport with her daughter Amal, 36, Baria Alamuddin, 66, looked in high spirits after the Oscar-winning actor flew her out to his villa on Lake Como, Italy.

The visit comes two months after Clooney popped the question to Miss Alamuddin.

Strolling through the airport with her daughter Amal, 36, Baria Alamuddin, 66, looked in high spirits after the Oscar-winning actor flew her out to his villa on Lake Como, Italy

The Hollywood star whisked Mrs Alamuddin out to his £25million holiday home – where the couple have been relaxing – for what is believed to be their first meeting.

Clooney may be known for his relaxed charm but, given Mrs Alamuddin’s stature as an award-winning journalist, the long-time bachelor must have been braced for a grilling.

However, Mrs Alamuddin – only 13 years Mr Clooney’s senior – is said to have enjoyed her time with the Hollywood star.

While it was only a short overnight trip, a source told People magazine: ‘They were outside, and Amal and her mom were smiling. It was going pretty great.

‘Amal’s mom left the next day, and at the airport they just looked so happy.’

Amal is one of Mrs Alamuddin’s four children, along with her other daughter Tala and sons Samer and Ziad.

She is the foreign editor of Al Hayat, a popular Arab newspaper, and has appeared numerous times as an expert on Middle Eastern affairs on CNN, Al-Jazeera, CNBC, the BBC and Sky News.

The couple are believed to be planning a September wedding which is rumoured to be taking place in Italy

She has interviewed political figures ranging from former Egyptian president Hosni Moubarak to former prime ministers Tony Blair and Margaret Thatcher and was the last journalist to speak to Indian prime minister Indira Ghandi before she was assassinated.

Along with her husband Ramzi – a retired professor of business studies at the American University of Beirut  – she fled her native Lebanon for the UK when Amal was two, escaping the civil war that raged in the country between 1975 and 1990.

While Ramzi moved back to Lebanon in 1991, Baria – who was once described as the country’s answer to Elizabeth Taylor because of her striking looks – has remained in the UK and now lives on a leafy ave-nue in Gerrards Cross, Buckinghamshire.

George Clooney’s mother, Nina, 74, has already met her daughter-in-law several times and is fully be-hind their relationship. She has previously said: ‘You can say I’m extremely happy. Amal’s a lovely girl. I like her very much.’

Prior to Mrs Alamuddin’s arrival, Mr Clooney and Miss Alamuddin had been enjoying a relaxing stay at the Oscar-winner’s £25million 30-room Italian villa.

The source told People: ‘George and Amal looked very much in love all weekend. They were all smiles, holding hands. There was an air of romance.’

The couple are believed to be planning a September wedding which is rumoured to be taking place in Italy.
