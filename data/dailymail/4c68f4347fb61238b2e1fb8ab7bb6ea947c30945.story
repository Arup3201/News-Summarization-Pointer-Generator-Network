Ed Miliband is turning off voters with ‘vacuous sloganeering’ and the ‘torturous repetition of political mantras’ like ‘One Nation’, one of his leading backbenchers said yesterday.

Simon Danczuk, the MP for Rochdale, complained that Labour MPs are ordered to ‘parrot’ the phrase in every public utterance.

Mr Danczuk is regularly used by the Labour press office as an attack dog, supplying quotes condemning the Conservative Party.

Warning: Simon Danczuk, MP for Rochdale, has warned the party's leader to find a new handle for the election

But in an article for PR Week yesterday, he sank his teeth into the Labour leader, warning that voters are repulsed by the ‘on message’ discipline once imposed by Tony Blair’s spindoctor Alastair Campbell.

Mr Miliband made the catchphrase ‘One Nation Labour’ a centrepiece of his 2012 speech to the Labour Party conference and the party even has a magazine called ‘One Nation’.

But Mr Danczuk complained: ‘We’ve already been told, from the very top, to intertwine ‘one nation’ into every policy statement we make, to build it into speeches, to continually repeat the phrase ‘one nation’ at every opportunity.

‘I’m beginning to worry we haven’t moved on from the 1990s. But I’m no longer sure simply repeating a key message or phrase has the same resonance with electors that it once had.’

Mr Danczuk praised the ‘One Nation’ speech as ‘excellent’ and a ‘land grab moment’ for Mr Miliband.

‘But please,’ he added, ‘it’s not a General Election winning strapline is it? The public isn’t as accepting of such simple messaging any more. Indeed, I’ve come to believe the public is actively turned off by the torturous repetition of political mantras.

Caution: Danczuk described Miliband's speech last year as a 'land grab moment' but now MPs are being ordered to 'parrot' the phrase in every appearance as they try to garner votes for the general election

‘I don’t think it’s a coincidence that neither the Tories nor the Lib Dems have invested effort in coming up with a strapline that is expected to have so much resonance among the electorate - I think they understand such an approach is too simple and outdated.’

Mr Danczuk argued that the MPs most trusted by the public are those who demonstrate ‘authenticity’ by speaking their minds.

‘It’s about showing character, imagination and a deeper understanding of people’s lives,’ he said.

‘It isn’t a coincidence that people like Boris Johnson, Frank Field, Tom Harris or Nigel Farage have the ability to communicate more effectively with the wider public - it’s because they are perceived to speak their mind, to say not what their party wants them to say, but what they think.

‘Those involved in politics need to speak as they find, they need to show a more emotional, common sense connection with the things that matter to voters and, yes, be a little less message-disciplined.’

Mr Danczuk also criticised Tory ministers for spouting David Cameron’s favourite buzz phrases ‘global race’ and ‘hard-working families’ - a sentiment shared by a large number of Conservative MPs.

Competition: He cited London Mayor Boris Johnson (left) and Ukip leader Nigel Farage (right) as leaders that capture the public's attention by appearing to speak their mind, not what their party wants them to say

‘When the Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps pops up on the news and tries to crowbar the phrase “for hardworking people” into every sentence no one honestly thinks he has any connection with the lives of people striving to do right for their families,’

Mr Danczuk said. ‘It’s just vacuous sloganeering.’ But he made clear that the same applies to his own leader.

‘While being on message still holds sway in the Labour Party I would argue that an opposite approach would be much more beneficial.

‘It needs to be less about a slogan, such as “one nation” and much more about developing an understanding amongst the electorate that we’re on their side, that we understand their worries and that we have the solutions to help them get on. This cannot be achieved through sloganeering.’

Tory MP Stewart Jackson said: ‘The curtain is lifted on Ed Miliband’s empty One Nation rhetoric.

‘This vacuous slogan belies Labour’s core philosophy of more spending, more borrowing and more taxes, exactly what got us into an economic mess in the first place.

‘As Simon Danczuk points out, Ed Miliband can’t move on from the policies that brought this country to its knees under Labour and no amount of short-term gimmicks will con the public into trusting Labour on the economy again.’
