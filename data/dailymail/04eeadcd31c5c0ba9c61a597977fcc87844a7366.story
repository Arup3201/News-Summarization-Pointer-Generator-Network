International outrage over Israel's bombardment of Gaza continued to grow today as the world reeled from news that a third deadly attack on a UN school sheltering fleeing Palestinians killed ten yesterday, including children.

The
 U.S. State Department was first to condemn the bombing, on the compound in the southern town of Rafah that was sheltering 3,000 Palestinian refugees, as 'appalling' 
and 'disgraceful' as it pleaded with Israel to take more care to avoid 
civilian casualties.

Hours later, David Cameron joined the chorus of disapproval with his own message to Tel Aviv in which he backed UN chief Ban Ki-moon's condemnation of the attack as 
'a moral outrage', but stopped short of agreeing that it was a 'criminal act'.

But the starkest condemnation of Israeli actions came from allies, France, whose foreign minister, Laurent Fabius, branded the 'killing of children and slaughter of civilians' as unjustifiable.

Panic: A Palestinian man carries an injured child following the Israeli military strike on a UN school in Rafah that killed ten, including children, and wounded more than 30

'Slaughter of civilians': Witnesses to Sunday's attack said a missile that looked like a rocket struck an area just outside the gates of the Rafah Preparatory A Boys School where children were queuing to buy sweets and biscuits from stalls.

'How
 many more deaths will it take to stop what must be called the carnage 
in Gaza?' Fabius said in a statement. 'The tradition of friendship 
between Israel and France is an old one and Israel's right to security 
is total, but this right does not justify the killing of children and 
the slaughter of civilians.'

France is closely allied with Israel, and Fabius' statement was a rare direct criticism. The Gaza war, now in its fourth week, has killed more than 1,800 Palestinians and more than 60 Israelis.

He added: 'This is why we need a political 
solution, of which the components are known, and which I believe should 
be imposed by the international community, because the two parties - 
despite countless efforts - have unfortunately shown themselves 
incapable of completing talks.' 

It came as a spokeswoman for David Cameron said
 Britain is reviewing all arms export licences to Israel in response to 
the Jewish state's escalating conflict with Hamas in Gaza.

'Stop the slaughter': But the starkest condemnation of Israel's actions in Gaza came from France, whose foreign minister, Laurent Fabius, branded the 'killing of children and slaughter of civilians' as unjustifiable

According
 to a report by a British parliamentary committee last month, 
outstanding government-approved contracts for export of dual use or 
military goods to Israel are worth more than £7.8billion . These 
include contracts to supply body armour, drone components, and missile 
parts.

'Clearly
 the current situation has changed compared to when some licences will 
have been granted, and we're reviewing those existing licences against 
the current situation but no decisions have been taken beyond going back
 again and reviewing,' the spokeswoman said.

Earlier, the British Prime Minister said he supported UN Secretary- General Ban Ki-moon's condemnation of the attack in Rafah as 
'a moral outrage and a criminal act'.

He said: 'I think the UN is right to speak out 
in the way that it has, because international law is very clear that 
there must not be the targeting of civilians or the targeting of schools
 if that is what has happened. The UN as the international body is right to speak out in the way it has.'

Pressed
 on whether he regarded the attack as a 'criminal act', Mr Cameron 
replied: 'The UN has spoken very clearly and I think they are right to 
speak very clearly...

'I'm not an international lawyer, so that's up 
to international lawyers. But international law is very, very clear that
 the use of force always has to be proportionate and civilians should 
not be targeted.'

Mr Cameron said the Government had been 'very clear
 that there needs to be an immediate comprehensive humanitarian 
ceasefire, that we want this conflict to stop'.

'We obviously do 
think it is appalling the loss of life that there has been,' he said. 
'From the start, though, we have also made the point that if the Hamas 
rocket attacks on Israel stop then that would be probably the fastest 
way to stop this conflict.'

Refugees: The school had been providing shelter to more than 3,000 people whose homes have been destroyed by fighting

Mr Cameron's comments echoed those of State 
Department spokesperson Jen Psaki, who last night said: 'The United
 States is appalled by today’s disgraceful shelling outside an UNRWA 
school in Rafah sheltering some 3,000 displaced persons,' said State 
Department spokesperson Jen Psaki, in a statement issued on Sunday.

'The 
coordinates of the school, like all UN facilities in Gaza, have been 
repeatedly communicated to the Israeli Defense Forces. We once again 
stress that Israel must do more to meet its own standards and avoid 
civilian casualties.'  

She called for a 'full and prompt' investigation 
of the incident.

Witnesses 
to Sunday's attack said a missile that looked like a rocket struck an 
area just outside the gates of the Rafah Preparatory A Boys School where
 children were queuing to buy sweets and biscuits from stalls.

Inside
 the U.N. school's compound, several bodies, among them children, were 
strewn across the ground in puddles of blood. 'Our trust and our fate 
are only in the hands of God!' one woman cried.

Ceasefire: The global community rallied in condemnation of Israel's attacks as Israel announced a seven-hour truce which was meant to open a 'humanitarian window' for aid

Why? The attack came days after a girl's school - sheltering 3,000 refugees - in Jabaliya was destroyed when a barrage of Israeli missiles rained down on it on Wednesday

Robert
 Turner, director of operations for the U.N. Palestinian refugee agency 
in Gaza, said the building had been providing shelter for some 3,000 
people - the same number that had been seeking refuge at a girl's school
 in Jabaliya last Wednesday when it too came under attack from a barrage
 of Israeli missiles.

Israeli intelligence spied on US Secretary of State John Kerry during failed peace talks with Palestinians and Arab states last year, it has been claimed.

As well as Israel, at least one other intelligence service listened to Mr Kerry's telephone calls during a key period of negotiations in 2013, according to the German magazine Der Spiegel.

The revelations come as relations between the US and Israel remain tense and amid criticism of Mr Kerry's diplomatic efforts in recent weeks.

Neither Washington nor Jerusalem has commented on the claims in the magazine, which says its information came from 'reliable sources'.

Mr Kerry had been speaking regularly with 'high-ranking negotiating partners' in the Middle East at the time of the alleged eavesdropping - and some of them were intercepted, according to the report.

A number of the calls were allegedly made on normal telephones - rather than encrypted equipment – and would have been transmitted by satellite.

'The government in Jerusalem then used the information obtained in international negotiations aiming to reach a diplomatic solution in the Middle East,' it added.

He said the strike killed at least one U.N. staffer.

'The
 locations of all these installations have been passed to the Israeli 
military multiple times,' Turner said. 'They know where these shelters 
are. How this continues to happen, I have no idea.'

The
 Israeli army - which says it has launched an investigation into the 
attack - claimed it had targeted three members of Islamic Jihad on a 
motorbike, contradicting witnesses who said no such vehicle was in the 
area when the bomb fell.

Israel
 launched its military operation in Gaza on July 8 in response to weeks 
of heavy rocket fire, carrying out hundreds of airstrikes across the 
crowded seaside territory. It then sent in ground forces July 17 in what
 it said was a mission to destroy the tunnels used by Hamas to carry out
 attacks.

Hamas has 
fired more than 3,000 rockets into Israel during what has turned into 
the bloodiest round of fighting ever between the two enemies.

The
 Israeli military said early Monday it would hold fire for a seven-hour 
'humanitarian window' beginning at 10 a.m. (0700 GMT), saying the truce 
would not apply to areas where troops were still operating. The military
 said it would respond to any attacks during that time.

While
 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to press on against
 Hamas, he is coming under international pressure to halt the fighting 
because of the heavy civilian death toll.

U.N.
 officials say more than three-quarters of the dead have been civilians,
 including the 10 people killed yesterday at the U.N. school in Rafah.

In
 the current round of fighting, U.N. shelters have been struck by fire 
seven times. UNRWA, the U.N. agency that assists Palestinian refugees, 
says Israel has been the source of fire in all instances. But it also 
has said it found caches of rockets in vacant UNRWA schools three times.

Israel
 accuses Hamas of using civilian areas for cover and says the Islamic 
militant group is responsible for the heavy death toll because it has 
been using civilians as 'human shields.'
