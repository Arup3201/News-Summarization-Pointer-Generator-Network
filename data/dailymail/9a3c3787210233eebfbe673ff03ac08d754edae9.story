A grandmother fighting for her life in hospital with rabies failed to tell doctors that she had recently visited India – or that she had been bitten by a dog there, it has emerged.

The woman, who is in her 50s and of Asian origin, caught the deadly virus two months ago while on the trip with her husband, but only began to develop symptoms recently.

Yesterday it was reported she had initially been sent home three times after going to a GP and A&E complaining of sickness.

Investigation: Five members of staff at Darent Valley Hospital have been vaccinated after coming into contact with the woman

Each time she was sent home because doctors believed her symptoms were ‘vague’.

Now hospital staff claim the diagnosis was hampered because she failed to mention her trip or the dog bite.

Had she done so ‘alarm bells would have rung immediately’, staff said.

The victim, who lives in London, is being treated in an isolation unit at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases at University College Hospital, London.

The Health Protection Agency has insisted members of the public are not at risk.

Twenty people who have been in contact with the patient, including relatives, a GP and hospital staff have been offered vaccines as a precaution.

The woman first visited her GP ten days ago complaining of sickness.

Two days later she went to the A&E unit at Darent Valley hospital in Dartford, Kent, only to be sent home.

She returned the next day but the hospital refused to admit her believing she was suffering from a mild illness.

A source at the hospital said: ‘Had the staff been properly informed about this woman’s trip to India, and especially that she had been bitten by a dog there, alarm bells would have rung immediately and the whole approach to her treatment would have been totally different to what happened.’

It was only when she visited her GP again last Friday – four days after the first appointment – rabies was suspected.

Deadly: The grandmother's illness is the first case of rabies in England in almost seven years. The last occurred in July 2005 when a woman died after contracting it from a dog bite during a holiday in the Indian resort of Goa, pictured

Rare: Naturalist David McRae (pictured) became the first person in Britain to die of the disease for 100 years after he was bitten on the hand by a rabid bat in 2002

Hospital staff have admitted she is unlikely to survive. But even if she had been diagnosed sooner it is unlikely her chances of recovery would have been any higher.

Once the symptoms of rabies develop – including sickness, aggression and hallucinations – the virus has spread to the brain and is nearly always fatal.

Professor Tom Solomon, of the Institute of Infection and Global Health at the University of Liverpool, said the mortality rate is ‘almost 100 per cent’. ‘Almost everyone who gets bitten but doesn’t seek help will die within a few weeks of the symptoms starting to show,’ he said.

Although no one has caught rabies in this country since the early 1900s, several have become infected while travelling abroad. The last case in England was in 2005 when a Manchester woman died after contracting the virus from a dog bite in Goa, India.

Killer: Rabies viruses showing their characteristic bullet shape. The disease has an extremely low survival rate once symptoms have developed

Vaccination programme: Although all but eradicated in the UK rabies is still common in developing countries

Lethal: There are about 55,000 cases of rabies worldwide each year. Half of all rabies cases occur in India, the Taj Mahal is pictured

Rabies is a viral infection which targets the nervous system and the brain.

It is only spread by infected animals to humans, most often through the animal biting or scratching the person.

It can also be spread by an animal's saliva being in contact with a graze or cut on a human's skin.

The majority of rabies cases result from being bitten by an infected dog.

The symptoms of the illness include high temperatures, numbness at the area where the bite occurred and hallucinations.

Some victims also have hydrophobia, which is a fear of water.

There are about 55,000 cases of rabies worldwide each year with most cases occurring in Africa and Asia.

But half of all rabies cases occur in India.

The grandmother's illness is the first case of rabies in England in almost seven years.

The last occurred in July 2005 when a woman from Manchester died after contracting it from a dog bite during a holiday in the Indian resort of Goa.

Most cases of rabies in the UK occur from people infected abroad or from quarantined animals.

Since 1946, 24 people have died who have been infected with rabies abroad. A total of four of these have occurred since 2000.

In 2003, it was discovered that UK bats may be carrying a rabies-like virus.

A bat handler died after contracting the virus in Scotland.
