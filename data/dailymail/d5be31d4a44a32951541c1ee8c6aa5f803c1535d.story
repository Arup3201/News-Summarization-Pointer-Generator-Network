Floyd Mayweather and his Money Team happened to bounce into the very Las Vegas night spot in which Amir Khan and his Army were celebrating the dazzling victory which has drastically revised opinions of our grown-up boy from Bolton on both sides of the Atlantic.

No words were exchanged between the parties as Mayweather breezed into a private VIP area of the trendy Hakkasan club in the MGM Grand, the vast casino resort deep in the bowels of which Khan had just delivered a virtuoso performance to bewilder, bedazzle and generally box the ears off the highly respected Devon Alexander.

Mayweather was first to leave and Khan was not surprised to see him hastily depart through the fire exit.

‘Floyd has just seen that he made a big mistake putting off fighting me earlier this year,’ said Khan with a cheeky grin on his bruised features. ‘I’m a much better boxer now than I was then and I’ll be even better if we do fight next May.

‘I’m not the complete package yet. I need to make some small adjustments. Technically, it’s about angles in the ring. Then there are small things like looking at my opponent instead of the referee when we’re told to break. Small things but they can be important if you’re not protecting yourself at moments like that.’

As he spoke, the American boxing community were talking of him in the same breath as Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao. He has complicated the debate as to which of this triumvirate of elite welterweights should fight each other next.

He has also challenged the misconceptions of so many of his British countrymen who have taken so nastily against him.

Khan, as he surveyed the famous Strip from the window of his penthouse suite, revealed that one of the reasons he moved his training base over here was to escape the poisonous atmosphere in some quarters back home.

‘There have been doubters from the beginning,’ he says. ‘I don’t really know why. Perhaps it’s because I was successful so early. Maybe they don’t like that I got so much so young. But do they think it comes easy? Don’t they realise all the hard work that goes into this? I’ve been under pressure to prove myself ever since day one as a teenager when I won my medal at the Athens Olympics.

‘Yet people keep having a go at me. Is it jealousy?’

With the growth of social media some of the attacks have become highly abusive and Khan says; ‘That helped make up my mind to train in America. I couldn’t work in that environment of hate.

‘This is a tough job and I need positive energy around me, not negative.’

Khan acknowledges that some of the resentment stems from a public perception that he can be arrogant. He takes the trouble to explain: ‘It is important for my self-belief going into a fight to be confident and to show it.’

Even if he were not so preoccupied with trying to coax Mayweather into the same ring – and hopefully become the first to beat him – he would not have time to go round Britain showing his real self to all the knockers.

But he wishes he could. 

‘When people get to know me their view changes,’ says Khan. ‘I’ve met so many on holiday or at events. I always give time to everyone. And they always end up saying that I’m very different from the way they imagined. They say I’m humble. A nice person.’

There is a divide in Britain between those who recognise that Amir Khan and those who flood Twitter with messages before fights like the one with Alexander hoping that he gets knocked out, badly hurt even.

He says: ‘I don’t know what I’ve done to be thought of and talked to like that. I’m actually more down to earth than normal people.’

As recognition of his prowess spreads, however grudgingly, he has this to say to the merchants of hate: ‘Spend a day with me and your view of me will change.’ 

Khan would also relish a fan with Manny Pacquiao (right) after his comprehensive win over Chris Algieri (left)

We who frequently spend time with this charming, courteous young man willingly endorse that message. To know him is to like him.

Furthermore, those who cling to prejudice against him risk missing out on a thrill ride to British glory.

Oscar De La Hoya, the iconic Golden Boy of the prize-ring who is Khan’s promoter, says: ‘After Mayweather and Pacquiao, Amir will become the greatest pound-for-pound fighter on the planet.’

It is no longer fantasy to imagine Khan proving it by beating one of them, particularly the one who was last seen heading for the fire escape in his home town.
