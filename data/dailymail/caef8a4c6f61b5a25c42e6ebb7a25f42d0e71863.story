Mentally ill: Claude Alexander Allen III was ruled guilty but mentally ill in the murder of his friend 

The son of a former top aide to President George W. Bush has pleaded guilty to hacking a friend to death with a tomahawk last year.

Claude Alexander Allen III, 21, will be sent to a state psychiatric facility after mental health examiners concluded that he was suffering 'complex delusions and disorganized thinking' when he brutally murdered Michael Phillip Harvey in Gaithersburg, Maryland, in May 2013.

Allen is the oldest son of Claude Allen II, who served as the assistant to the President for domestic policy from 2005 until 2006. The elder Mr Allen resigned after he was arrested for shoplifting. 

A subsequent investigation revealed that he had been taking items from store shelves in Target and Hecht's and 'returning' them - racking up $5,000 in a year. All this, despite earning a salary of $160,000 from the White House. 

The Washington Post reports that the younger Allen was at his parents' home with Harvey and another friend on May 23, 2013 when he became convinced that Harvey was trying to hurt him. 

A state psychiatrist's report says that Allen's psychotic delusions led him to believe that Harvey was a member of a rival gang and that he might attack. 

Allen also believed that Harvey had been stealing from him and was trying to make him sell drugs.

Allen then grabbed a 'tactical tomahawk' that he had bought online and hit his friend Harvey in the head and neck five times until he was dead.

Allen then told his other friend 'I took care of the person who broke in,' prosecutors said, according to the Post. 

After Allen pleaded guilty to first-degree murder on Tuesday, Judge Terrence McGann found him not criminally liable, based on reports from psychiatrists.

Allen will be sent to the Clifton T. Perkins psychiatric facility, where he will be held until a judge finds that he is no longer a threat to the community.
