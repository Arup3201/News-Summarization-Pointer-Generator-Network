'I have a lot of shoes.' 15-year-old Lauren Walsh, from Morecambe in Lancashire, is giving a guided tour of her extensive shoe collection.

'I was begging my mum for these,' she continues, showing off a pair of Hunter wellies, 'and said I'd wear them all the time. 'They were really expensive but I haven't even worn them once. Most of them I don't even wear!'

And it's not just shoes. Lauren, who spends more than £600 a month, also had a wardrobe crammed with designer treats, most of which lie unworn.

Paying for it all is her mother Jackie, a carer on £6.81 an hour, who has been forced to take another two jobs, including a minimum wage cleaning role, in order to fund her daughter's expensive habits.

'I am soft with the girls,' says Jackie, who also has a younger daughter named Rachel. 'I know  that I'm soft and even my friends will say: "Say no to them Jackie!" but I can't.'

Jackie, who says her philosophy on finance boils down to 'if you've got it, spend it', is currently on the hunt for a fourth job but says making her daughters happy is worth it.

'Lauren just loves shopping but then so do I,' she adds. 'She probably gets that from me. If you've got it, spend it - that's what I say. 

'Nine times out of 10, she does get it, to be fair. She's got me wrapped round her finger somehow.'

Lauren herself is unabashed about her spendthrift ways and cheerfully describes herself as 'spoilt'.

'I think my friends would describe me as spoilt and I don't disagree with them because I know I am,' she laughs.

'I do feel quite guilty because it's just money wasted. I don't know how much [my shoes] cost because my mum just buys them for me.

'She buys them and I don't ask. I just say thank you. I know my mum is a pushover, and I'm not going to lie, it's just because she's really soft and she agrees to most stuff.'

Although Lauren, who says she'll spend 'whatever money I can get', does have a paper round to help fund her shopping addiction, it certainly isn't your average job.

'I do half of it - maybe 10 papers,' says Jackie, who helps Lauren do her paper round. 'Lauren does 14. But then Lauren gets the money and I don't get any.'

'I do it in the car with my 
mother because it's easier and and the bag is quite heavy sometimes,' reveals an unabashed Lauren.

'Lots of people don't think it's OK
 that my mum helps me with my paper round but I am grateful for her 
doing it with me because I don't think I'd still be doing it now if she wasn't with me.'

Despite Lauren's big spending habits and paper round demands, Jackie says it's all worth it thanks to the confidence boost it gives her daughter.

'Lauren's totally different when we go 
out shopping,' she explains. 'She's so full of energy and we have a good time and laugh 
and joke...It gives her a lift,  I think, for that short while.'

'I do feel pressurised when I see people in magazines,' says Lauren. 'They look 
like normal people but they're really pretty and they're wearing all new
 clothes, so you think, oh if I wear those, I'll look really good as 
well.

'Girls feel a lot more better when they're in with the trends and getting new stuff,' she adds. 'I
 know that my mum does [spend too much] but it's her decision. She gets it 
out of her pocket, she pays for it and I don't force her to do it.'
