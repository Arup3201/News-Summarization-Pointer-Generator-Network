A brave mother led rescuers to the wreckage of a plane crash she had survived in Alaska as she desperately tried to get help for her baby boy who died in the accident.

Melanie Coffee walked for nearly a mile to find help after the light aircraft she had been traveling in with nine other people crashed in fog and freezing conditions on Friday.

Four people, including Miss Coffee's five-month-old son, Wyatt, died when a single-engine Cessna 208, making a scheduled flight to Saint Mary's, crashed at about 6.30pm.

When efforts by the 25-year-old to revive her five-month-old son Wyatt failed, Miss Coffee made the agonizing decision to go in search of rescuers.

'I believe she's the real hero in this,'
Saint Mary's Village Police Officer Fred Lamont Jr said. The village, like many in the remote region, is off the road system and residents rely on aircraft to get around.

Miss Coffee had called emergency services but search efforts were hampered by the fog as rescue workers used cars and snowmobiles to try to find the site.

Despite having chest injuries, Miss Coffee was able to find a rescue party and lead them to the crash site, where her baby, the pilot Terry Hansen, 68, and passengers Rose Polty, 57, and Richard Polty, 65, had died.

The surviving passengers, four of them in critical condition, had to be carried away on stretchers and then airlifted to hospital.

They were named as Pauline Johnson, 37, Kylan Johnson, 14, Tanya Lawrence, 35, Garrett Moses, 30, and Shannon Lawrence.

Everyone on board, except the pilot and Shannon Lawrence, lived in Mountain Village. Mr Hansen was from Bethel but the address for Shannon Lawrence was not known.

Megan Peters, a spokeswoman for the Alaska State Troopers, said the aircraft would have been flying in freezing rain.

Office Lamont described the conditions as ice fog with moisture that stuck to vehicles.

NTSB Investigator Clint Johnson said the cause of the crash has not been determined and that the investigation was 'very much in the preliminary stages'.

Two investigators were on their way to Bethel on Saturday to meet troopers for transportation to the crash site.

Reaching the wreckage would depend on weather and safety considerations, Ms Peters said.

'There's no rush to get there,' she said. 'There's no reason to risk anyone's life because no one's life is in jeopardy.'

A statement by Jim HIckerson, the president of Hageland Aviation, which owned the aircraft, described the crash as 'an unspeakable tragedy'.

'Hageland is working to gather information to answer questions and do what we can to ease the suffering of those involved in the accident,' he said.
