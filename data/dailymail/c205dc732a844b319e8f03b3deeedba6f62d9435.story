A British woman who moved to France to follow her dream of becoming a winemaker has spoken of her anguish after vandals poured £60,000 of her product down the drain.

Katie Jones, who left Leicestershire two decades ago, lost the equivalent of 4,000 bottles of white wine – an entire year’s vintage.

The 47-year-old said it was her ‘worst nightmare’ to discover she had lost a year’s work when she returned home after a business trip.

Target: Katie Jones has lost the equivalent of 4,000 bottles of white wine in a 'vandalism attack' on her vineyard in Languedoc

She told the Mail: ‘It was a real shock, it was absolutely awful. It is really difficult to explain. For a winemaker it is the worst nightmare.

‘It is absolutely devastating. It is horrible. Wine is unique. That vintage was unique. It can never be made again. I will never taste it again.’

Miss Jones said she did not believe she had been targeted because she is British.

But she hinted that her nationality may have been a factor in the attack in a comment to a well-wisher on social networking site Twitter.

She said: ‘Yes it is quite unbelievable! One of the inconveniences of living in small french village.’

Miss Jones made the discovery on March 31 on her return from a wine fair in Germany – just before April Fool’s Day.

‘I would have loved it to be an April Fool,’ she said. But instead it was a devastating setback to her business in just her fourth year of winemaking.

‘It is really difficult to deal with when you are starting a business, creating an image, and attracting customers,’ she said.

The vandals emptied two tanks of her award winning Grenache Gris at the winery in Tuchan in the Languedoc mountains – destroying the entire supply of white wine.

The wine, sold under her Domaine Jones brand through the Wine Society, was worth £15 a bottle.

Wine critic Jancis Robinson said it was another case of the ‘increasingly common phenomenon’ of ‘wine vandalism’.

Saving grace: Internet wine retailer Naked Wines, raised cash from its customers to help Katie make the 2013 vintage of her white wine

But Miss Jones hopes to bounce back after an internet wine retailer came to the rescue.

Naked Wines, set up by entrepreneur Rowan Gormley, has promised to stump up cash raised by its customers to help make the 2013 vintage.

In return, Miss Jones will sell a range of wine exclusively through the company next year.

‘I am so grateful for this overwhelming show of support,’ she said.

‘When I lost my entire white vintage it was a disaster but this will help us get back on our feet.’

Eamon FitzGerald, chief operating officer at Naked Wines, said: ‘We had to do something. She’s a first class winemaker and deserves some help to get back in business.’

Naked Wines, which was founded in 2008, last month announced a maiden annual profit of £1million after sales jumped 57 per cent to £34.9million.

Miss Jones, from Ashby-de-la-Zouch, started making her own wine in 2009 having spent the previous 17 years in sales and marketing for wine firm Mont Tauch in Tuchan. She now produces around 16,000 bottles of red and white wine a year.

The red wine was untouched in the attack.
