Melissa Mackenzie, 21, lost control of her Vauxhall Corsa when she drove over newly laid chippings after enjoying a meal with her twin sister Sarah

An aspiring model who died in a car crash could have survived if she had worn a seat belt, an inquest heard.

Melissa Mackenzie, 21, lost control of her Vauxhall Corsa when she drove over newly laid chippings after enjoying a meal with her twin sister Sarah.

The fashion store manageress, from Pwllheli in Gwynedd, Wales, was partially thrown out of the shattered driver's window, suffering the injury that led to her death.

Ruling that the death was accidental, Coroner Dewi Pritchard-Jones said that had she been wearing a seat belt Miss Mackenzie would not have suffered the injuries that led to her death.

He took the chance to reiterate the importance of wearing a seat belt, adding 'Seat belts
do save lives'.

He said: 'If I look at the last twelve
months I have had four or five road traffic cases that were entirely 
survivable if the people concerned had been wearing seat belts.'

After the hearing, Miss Mackenzie's father Andrew said: 'She was responsible, independent and ambitious. She
was a high achiever.'

Following her death, he described how his life had been 'ripped apart'.

He said: 'She was 21-years-old and achieving all she had set out to succeed in.

'She was a highly social, well-loved girl who seemed to know everybody. Her popularity is evident when you see the Facebook tributes posted - and the lovely, kind words written.'

The hearing also heard that there was no alcohol found in Miss Mackenzie's blood.

The coroner said that before the incident in August 2011, the 21-year-old would have seen a warning sign advising motorists of a loose surface and recommending a 10mph maximum speed.

The coroner said: 'At what speed she approached the bend the evidence I have heard doesn't say but my impression is she went into that bend at a speed in excess of 10mph.

'Having gone around the bend the car went out of control.

He
added: 'There would have been a thickness of chippings. It could be 
that the nearside wheels went on to that area of thicker loose 
chippings.

'The evidence isn't clear but that would possibly explain why the car went out of control.'Â 

'The underlying cause of all this is she went in the right-hand bend at a speed that was, with the benefit of hindsight, higher than prudent for the conditions. That made the car go out of control.'

Senior Gwynedd council engineer Peter Garlick said the road had not yet been swept when the accident happened.
