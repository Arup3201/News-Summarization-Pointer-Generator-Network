Why can't God and science exist concurrently?

And why shouldn't we remain relgious while embracing the ways technology is altering our life pattern?

These are some of the fundamentals behind the Terasem Faith, a new-age religion that has been developed to allow people to continue following their traditional denomination while endorsing the advancement of science and technology.

According to a TIME magazine feature, Terasem’s followers are dedicated to studying and raising awareness about what they call 'personal cyberconciousness' or the creation of mindfiles.

However skeptics have been quick to call it 'the rapture of the nerds'.

The Rothblatt family that created and run the Terasem Faith keep a robot named BINA48 - named after mother and wife Bina Rothblatt - to see how precisely a robot in 2014 can function using the mindfiles system

Terasem subscribers believe that by ritualistically recording your thoughts and feelings, you can ultimately assemble a digital copy of yourself that would be available for future use.

It starts with writing down or recording a video of a thought, memory or feeling and uploading it to a website, with more than 32,000 people so far creating free mindfile accounts.

The mindfiles are stored on servers located in the two Terasem headquarters in Vermont and Florida, and by using Terasem’s services you accept their promise that they will protect those files for the long-term future, making it possible for some not-yet-invented software to organize those files and upload them into an artificial body 500 years from now.

'A lot of people have problems digesting the idea,' says Gabriel Rothblatt, a pastor at Terasim and son of the creators, Bina and Martine Rothblatt.

'Instead of saying ''mindfiling'', I say ‘'digital scrapbooking''.'

Terasem comes from the Greek word for 'Earthseed' and is organized around four core tenets— life is purposeful, death is optional, God is technological and love is essential.

A new religion has set out to store memories for centuries and deliver its believers into a world where our souls can outlive their human carriers.

It is considered a 'transreligion', meaning followers do not have to give up being Christian, Jewish or Muslim, for example, to join.

'Einstein said science without religion is lame. Religion without science is blind,' Martine Rothblatt told TIME.

'Bina and I were inspired to find a way for people to believe in God consistent with science and technology so people would have faith in the future.'

While Terasem is not short of skeptics, religious pundits say the ideology is befitting of today's world.

More and more Americans are admitting to no longer being 'reglious', however maintaining they are 'spiritual'.

Additionally, companies like Google and PayPal are investing millions of dollars into technology that could potentially alter the end of life.

Gabriel Rothblatt, a pastor at Terasem and son of creators Bina and Martine Rothblatt, was working as the manager of a pizza restaurant until 2011 and is now running for Congress

Lori Rhodes, who helps run Terasem Movement Inc., said its easy to write it off as a cult, but insists it is just a religion finding its start.

'Most people say, '‘Oh, it looks like a cult'',’ Rhodes says.

'My older sister did. When she first looked at it, she told me, ''Don’t work for that organization. It looks like a cult and you’ll be blacklisted in the legal community''.'

'But any religion starts with just a few members.

'And I guess organized religion is cultish.

'Some people call it the rapture of the nerds.'
