Mauricio Pochettino wants judgment on his Tottenham revolution to begin at Upton Park on Saturday.

The new Spurs boss takes charge of his first competitive game against West Ham — who beat his new side three times last season.

Louis van Gaal claims it will take him at least three months to get Manchester United into shape, but Pochettino has waived his right to a bedding in period, knowing he must hit the ground running.

‘I don’t demand time, only to work hard every day, to build, to improve every player in the squad,’ he said.

‘Always in football, the result manages your career and the decisions, because we need to win.

‘This is our job, not only to provide your philosophy to the team and your style — you need to win, this is the first objective.

‘We understand that football is in the present, it is difficult to take time. We need to improve and learn quickly, for sure.’

Having time to embed his philosophy at White Hart Lane isn’t a given with Daniel Levy around.

Threat: Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy has sacked nine managers in 13 years, including two last season

The Spurs chairman has sacked nine managers in 13 years at the club. And Pochettino knows what is in store if results do not go his way.

‘I do not worry about that. I know the business in football,’ he said. ‘I know that you live by the results, you need to get results.

‘Pressure is not from outside, from the media or supporters, it’s my pressure. Our philosophy and style is to win every game.’
