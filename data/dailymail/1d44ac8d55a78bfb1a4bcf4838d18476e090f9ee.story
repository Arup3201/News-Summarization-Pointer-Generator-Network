A mother and daughter are lucky to be alive after their washing spontaneously combusted and a fire tore through their home.

Nicola Boulton and daughter Claire awoke to the smell of smoke in the early hours of the morning - and firefighters had to rescue them through the bathroom window of their house in Leicester.

They were flabbergasted when fire crews revealed that the source of the blaze was a pile of clean tea towels that had burst into flames.

Firefighters believe the cloths had retained heat after being taken out of the tumble dryer - and got so hot they burst into flames.

Cafe manager Miss Boulton, 19, had brought the tea towels home from work countless times to wash and dry.

She said: 'It’s bizarre. We’ve washed and tumble dried those towels the same way hundreds of times and nothing has ever gone wrong.

'I woke up and I could smell this really strong smell of smoke. I went to my door and looked out and there were clouds of smoke billowing up the stairs.

'I shouted to my mum who was fast asleep, and we ran into the bathroom.'

Feeling the heat: The flames from the pile of washing melted a plastic wash basket and set fire to the stool and wall, sending clouds of thick smoke through the house

The pair were rescued shortly after 2am yesterday morning, after 999 operators told them to shut themselves in the bathroom and put wet towels around the door.

Leicestershire Fire and Rescue Service insisted after the Boultons' fire that although blazes started by spontaneous combustion were unusual, they were not unknown.

East Sussex Fire & Rescue Service warned last October of the danger of ‘exploding tea towels’ after the phenomenon struck twice in a single day in Brighton at a restaurant and college.

A spokesman said cooking fats or chemicals on tea towels can spontaneously combust after being dried - and advised people to properly air laundry after drying to avoid it happening.

Mrs Boulton, 49, said: 'We were struggling to breathe as the smoke was coming in. It was really quite frightening. It doesn’t seem real now.'

After helping them out of the window, firefighters put out the blaze - but could find no obvious source of the fire.

After investigating the scene, they realised a pile of recently laundered tea towels had spontaneously combusted.

The towels and a plastic washing basket were destroyed in the blaze but, apart from a blackened kitchen wall, the rest of the house was untouched.

Fire station manager Steve Smith, said blazes started by spontaneous combustion were unusual but not unknown.

He said: 'Due to the configuration of 
the materials and the circumstances at the scene, we have determined the
most likely cause was self-heating to a point where ignition occurred.

'This is not a common phenomenon, but it has occurred and has been widely documented in the past.'

Mrs Boulton, a personal banker for Barclays, said: 'It was the most terrifying night of my life.

'I’d taken the towels out of the dryer before I went to bed at about 9.30pm, and made sure all the plugs and gas hobs were turned off, like I always do.

'My daughter woke me up screaming: "Mum, there’s smoke coming up the stairs!", and our smoke alarm started going off.

'She pulled me into the bathroom and I grabbed my phone, but I was shaking so much I could barely dial 999.

'We could barely breathe and we had to stand in the bath and lean out of the window to get air.

'The firemen came and helped us out of the window, but as they helped me down the ladder, I heard one firefighter shout to another: "Bloody hell, get out of there now!".

'It was terrifying - we were put into an ambulance and taken to hospital, just to be checked over.

'The firemen asked us what had been on top of the stool in the kitchen, and I said, my plastic washing basket with the towels in it.

'I think he was expecting me to say I’d left a candle burning, or a plug socket overloaded - he was pretty surprised.

'He said that it would have burned very slowly though, so it would have taken a few hours for the fire to take hold.

'I couldn’t believe doing the washing nearly cost me my house - or worse, my life.

'We’re very lucky that we were able to get out so quickly, and the firefighters did such a good job containing the fire.'
