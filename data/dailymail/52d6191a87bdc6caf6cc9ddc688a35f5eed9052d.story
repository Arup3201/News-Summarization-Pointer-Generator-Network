When Louis van Gaal made the stunning selections of youngsters Tyler Blackett and Jesse Lingard in his very first Manchester United team in the Premier League, jaws hit the Old Trafford floor. We knew Van Gaal was no ordinary manager, but this was team selection from the Twilight Zone.

Yet no-one could have predicted that the Dutchman would go on to become the top-flight's biggest Tinkerman. Even Claudio Ranieri's Chelsea sides look predictable compared with the chopping and changing at United this season.

You've about as much chance of predicting the lottery numbers as you have trying to second guess who Van Gaal will pick to start against Swansea on Sunday in the reverse of the opening fixture of the season. But, after a quick call to Mystic Meg, a comparison between Van Gaal's first selection and the most likely United team to start at the Liberty Stadium makes for stunning reading.

Only four players from the team who were sunk 2-1 at Old Trafford are likely to be handed the chance to wreak revenge on Swansea after a season of enormous upheaval. David De Gea, Chris Smalling and Wayne Rooney look certain to survive the cull after the opening-day defeat, although which position the England captain will feature in is anyone's guess as he is shunted from centre forward to No 10, central midfield, defensive midfield and then back up front again.

Blackett, 20, and Lingard, 22, have both been deemed below the required standard to make Van Gaal's team - at least for now - while Javier Hernandez joined Real Madrid on loan in September and Darren Fletcher packed his bags for West Brom in January.

But there are others who have since fallen victim to Van Gaal's tactical whims. Phil Jones, Juan Mata and Ander Herrera have all enjoyed extended stints in the United team but are far from certain starters. After his goalscoring return in the FA Cup win against Preston, Herrera looks the more likely to start.

Ashley Young established himself as a favourite of Van Gaal's on the left flank in the former Holland boss's much-maligned 3-5-2 formation but is only making his way back from a torn hamstring suffered on New Year's Day.

How United lined up against Swansea on the opening day of the season, in a 3-5-2 formation

Of those who started on the bench back in August, only the unconvincing Adnan Januzaj and the reborn Marouane Fellaini are in contention for the reverse fixture at Swansea. Ben Amos has gone on loan to Bolton, Michael Keane made his loan to Burnley permanent last month, while Reece James is still yet to play for the Red Devils. Shinji Kagawa was sent back to his adoring fans at Borussia Dortmund and Nani went on a temporary move to Sporting Lisbon.

Meanwhile, Van Gaal has splurged over £150million on a wealth of talent, who have carried United to third in the table and kept the club on course for a Champions League spot without ever offering convincing evidence that they are growing into a top-class team.

Marcos Rojo (£16m) and Luke Shaw (£30m, but signed before Van Gaal's arrival) are likely to start at the Liberty. Shaw was missing from United's season opener along with fellow injury victims Robin van Persie, Michael Carrick, Evans and Antonio Valencia, who is another Van Gaal favourite at right wing-back or right back if needed.

But it is further forward where United's spending spree has made the most impact on the team. Angel Di Maria, the British record £60m buy from Real Madrid, and Daley Blind, who cost £15m from Ajax, are almost certain to start in central midfield.

Victor Valdes, the former Barcelona keeper who joined as a free agent in January, is likely to be joined on the bench by young defender Patrick McNair and possibly another young player, 19-year-old striker James Wilson.

He will be competing for a spot with Radamel Falcao, whose £6m loan from Monaco on £250,000-per-week wages is proving to be a costly and embarrassing mistake. The Colombia striker has been Van Gaal's first-choice in recent weeks but his miserable form surely means demotion to the bench or even further into the abyss.

After all the ins and outs, Van Gaal's matchday squad of 18 is likely to include just nine of those who saw in the new season full of hope that their new Dutch manager would lead them to a title triumph after a year in the doldrums after Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement. 

It is not just the personnel that has changed at Old Trafford since then, but the attitude.
