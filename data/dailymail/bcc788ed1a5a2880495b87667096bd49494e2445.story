A unique photo album of the great and good of Victorian England thought to have been owned by Lord Lucan is expected to fetch £1,000 at auction.

The collection of 250 fascinating images of the aristocracy were put together in a 32-page scrapbook, which was once held by the fugitive aristocrat.

Some feature famous faces such as Queen Victoria and Prince Albert while others show noble families in more informal poses on days out.

The aristocracy at play: The Meade and Clanwilliam families pictured at the turn of the century, in one of many photographs from an album once owned by Lord Lucan

Some of the images in the book - put up for auction by a mystery 'photography dealer' - have been cut around like a scrapbook to fit them all into it.

They date from 1872 to 1918 and John Bingham, 7th Earl of Lucan - known as Lord Lucan - is thought to have acquired the book after it was compiled.

The photo album was passed down to him by his father George Charles Patrick Bingham, 6th Earl of Lucan, who was given it by his parents.

Photography
 expert Chris Albury, of Dominic Winter auctioneers in South Cerney, 
Gloucestershire, said it was an impressive collection.

He added: ‘The album is full of portraits from nobles and some royals from the turn of the 20th century.

‘A few of the pictures have also been signed by the photographer which is pretty typical of the time.

‘We
 know the images belonged to Lord Lucan because we sold the same album 
in 2001 and there was a lot of anecdotal evidence to suggest so.  

‘My personal favourite is a shot of Queen Victoria, it's pretty amazing.’

The
 family names that turn up most frequently in the photo album are 
Clanwilliam and Meade, with Lucan being on the latter's family tree.

Royalty: Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale the grandson of Queen Victoria and Prince George (left) and Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn, the third son of Queen Victoria, pictured in Canada in 1870 (right)

His grandparents were Captain 
Honourable Edward Dawson of the Royal Navy, who was married to a Lady 
Elizabeth Selina Georgiana Meade.

Mr
 Albury added: ‘I imagine therefore that it’s gone by descent to his 
father and then him, but there’s no ownership description to prove that.

‘It definitely belonged to his family forebears - but how much he knew about it is not entirely clear.’

Lucan
 vanished from his home in London's Belgravia in 1974 after his 
children’s nanny Sandra Rivett was murdered after being mistaken for his
 wife.

Mysterious: Lord Lucan (left) allegedly mistook his children’s nanny Sandra Rivett (right) for his wife Veronica, from whom he was estranged, and hit her with lead piping

It is believed that Lucan, a professional gambler, mistook Mrs Rivett for his wife Veronica, from whom he was estranged, and hit her with lead piping.

Lucan telephoned his mother, asking her to collect his children, and then drove to a friend’s house in East Sussex.

He left hours later and was never seen again. His brother Hugh Bingham said last year that Lucan died in 2004 and is buried in Africa.

The album has an estimated sale price of between £700 and £1,000 and is being sold by Dominic Winter on Thursday.
