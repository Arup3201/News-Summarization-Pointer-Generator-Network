Millions of pounds of taxpayers’ money has been spent by Prison Service bosses on taxis, hairdressers - and even actors.

Many private firms provide services under contract to the Ministry of Justice, with one taxi firm being paid £920,000 for its work.

The Prison Service also spent £720,000 on professional actors for role playing that is aimed at helping inmates get into employment.

Meanwhile £4.5million was paid to taxi firms for moving inmates and staff around Britain and £84,000 spent on hairdressers at only three prisons.

A TaxPayers’ Alliance spokesman said the MoJ should be ‘cutting out barmy spending’ and stop providing ‘creature comforts’ for prisoners.

But an MoJ spokesman insisted to The Sun that the contracts help the department ‘drive efficiency’ and ‘achieve best value for taxpayers’.

Other companies were paid £60,000 to launch a radio station in Brixton prison and £58,000 for an artificial sports pitch at Wormwood Scrubs.

In addition, £645,000 was paid to a counselling firm and £100,000 went on inmates’ toothbrushes, according to data released under the Freedom of Information Act.

The figures came as David Cameron was today expected to unveil plans to outsource large parts of the Probation Service to the private sector.

Private firms such as G4S, along with charities and voluntary groups, will be offered cash incentives to put offenders on the right paths.

It is part of a fresh drive to cut crime and reoffending, with the scheme applying to all but the most hardened and dangerous criminals.
