Chelsea midfielder Cesc Fabregas believes there is something more 'satisfying' than scoring a goal on a football pitch - providing for one.

The former Arsenal and Barcelona star has revealed he has always felt more satisfaction having assisted a strike for one of his team-mates than he has when finding the back of the net himself.

Spain international Fabregas has enjoyed a wonderful start to life at Chelsea and he will head to Old Trafford with the rest of the Blues squad to take on Manchester United in a key clash on Sunday.

Fabregas, speaking to Champions, the official magazine of the UEFA Champions League, said: 'Whenever they asked me in interviews if I preferred scoring or providing an assist, I would always say an assist.

'There is nothing quite like scoring a goal. Scoring goals is the most beautiful part of football, but I have always identified myself with and enjoyed providing the final ball.

'Only the people who know how to play the final pass for a goal know what it feels like, and I feel immense joy when a goal is scored from my pass.

'Putting the striker through one-on-one with the keeper is enormously satisfying.'

Life at Stamford Bridge appears bright right now for Fabregas, who has scored twice and assisted nine goals in his 11 Premier League and Champions League appearances so far.

He has forged a wonderful relationship with striker Diego Costa, with the pair helping Chelsea to the top of the table.

But the 27-year-old has admitted it took him a little time to adjust to Blues boss Jose Mourinho's methods - although now he has fully embraced the Portuguese's philosophy and is ready to prosper at the Bridge.

He continued: 'At the start I found it tough in training with a coach like Mourinho, who is a bit more imposing. 'Be well-positioned. Drop off. Support the players behind you, do not lose the ball”. (But now) I really like it.'
