Wayne Swan regrets 'not telling the Australian public more' about the removal of Kevin Rudd as Prime Minister

The former Treasurer believes the failure to convince Kevin Rudd to contest the first ballot after he was removed in 2010 was the party's downfall

Mr Swan said Labor should have been 'more open' about why the party dumped Kevin Rudd which would have removed him as a destabilising force within the government

Wayne Swan says it's unlikely they'll bury the hatchet over a quiet drink because Kevin Rudd 'is not a couple of beers kind of guy'

Mr Swan claims Julia Gillard was 'the better politician' not just the best PM and Bill Shorten can lead the party to victory over Tony Abbott

For Wayne Swan the bitterness still runs deep.

The former Treasurer, now sitting on Labor's backbench and in the middle of promoting his new book 'The Good Fight' on his time in government, said if there was one regret from those turbulent six years of the Rudd-Gillard governments, it was not putting an end to the Kevin Rudd threat once and for all in 2010 by way of a party room ballot.

Mr Swan believes if he and his ALP colleagues had been able to convince Kevin Rudd to contest the leadership within the party room, a heavy loss would have humiliated the then PM and saved the Labor government from three subsequent years of turmoil.

Wayne Swan regrets not getting Kevin Rudd to contest the 2010 party room ballot. He's convinced a heavy defeat would have stopped the ousted PM having any influence on Julia Gillard's leadership

The former Treasurer told Daily Mail Australia today that 'in retrospect we should have dealt with Kevin through his running for the leadership (against Julia Gillard) in 2010'.

'I regret not telling the Australian public more,' Mr Swan said.

'We should have been more forthright (publicly) as to the reasons why it all came about and then had a vote about it, rather than leaving it and let it sit,' Mr Swan said.

The resentment over Rudd's sniping and destabilising of the Gillard leadership clearly still festers inside Wayne Swan.

When mention was made of their friendship coming through the Labor ranks and Kevin Rudd being Godfather to his son, the Member for Lilley in Queensland was quick to interrupt and say: 'but that was a long time ago remember, well before I became a Minister'.

The end of the road. Julia Gillard and Wayne Swan leave the leadership ballot in 2013 when the then PM was defeated by Kevin Rudd 

As for letting bygones be bygones, Mr Swan said he wasn't expecting a call from the ex-PM any time soon.

'I'm not holding any ongoing grudge but he's not the let's have a couple of beers kind of guy anyway.'

In his book 'The Good Fight', Mr Swan says Kevin Rudd's 'prime ministership was not built to last'.

'Its shelf life, being built on celebrity, as it was, was likely quite short unless he changed.

‘Kevin’s treatment of people was extraordinarily vindictive and juvenile. And it was frequently on display.’

Wayne Swan says he's not waiting for a phone call from Kevin Rudd 'I don't think he's a couple of beers kind of guy'

He writes in the book that 'Kevin Rudd had left no stone unturned in wreaking his revenge on Julia Gillard and the government'.

Mr Swan said his biggest acts of treachery was during the But he added 'all of his subsequent treachery pales into insignificance compared to what he and his agents did in the 2010 election campaign'.

Mr Swan said of allegations Mr Rudd was the source of leaks from strategy room discussions as being 'an act of treachery worthy only of someone of the standing of Billy Hughes as a Labor Party rat'.

Wayne Swan launches 'The Good Fight', in which he accuses Kevin Rudd of 'an act of treachery worthy only of someone of the standing of Billy Hughes as a Labor Party rat'.

Just as quick, his response to the question, with hindsight, as to which of the two Prime Ministers he served was the better politician.

'I'd vote for Julia Gillard, unquestionably and I don't say that with any recall,' he added.

Julia Gillard is 'unquestionably the better politician' when compared with Kevin Rudd, says Wayne Swan

As for current leader Bill Shorten, Wayne Swan has given his seal of approval.

'What he did yesterday was courageous, it was the right thing to do. That's the sort of thing  leadership is made of,' he said in reference to the ALP leader going public on Victoria Police investigations clearing him of rape allegations.

And as for Labor returning to power at the next election, under Shorten.

'Too right, I'm very optimistic and you wouldn't have made that judgement six months ago.'
