Britain’s net value has doubled in less than two decades to a record £7.6trillion, it emerged today.

The total wealth is equivalent to £119,000 for every person or £289,000 for every family in the country.

And we are a nation of homeowners, with the value of houses accounting for almost two-thirds of the entire net worth of the UK.

Since 1997 the total net wealth of the nation has risen from around £3trillion to £7.6trillion in 2013

The eye-watering sums were revealed in the latest National Balance Sheet, published today.

It shows that the total value of everything in the UK more than doubled between 1997 and the end of 2013.

The value of Britain has risen steadily every year, with the exception of the economic downturn in 2008 and 2009.

The ONS said: ‘At the end of 2013, the UK was valued at an estimated £7.6 trillion, an increase of 4 per cent (£324 billion) from 2012, which continued the long-term upward pattern.’

Homes and charities were worth £8.46trillion alone, with the debts of businesses and the government reducing the total national wealth

The value of non-financial assets, which range from houses and cars to cattle and fine art, rose by £343 billion, while net financial assets and liabilities decreased in value by £19 billion.

The combined wealth of households and non-profit organisations such as churches, charities and trade unions was a net £8.5 trillion, up from £7.6trillion in 2012. This was equivalent to an average of £320,000 per household.

By far the most valuable assets in this sector were houses, worth £4.7 trillion. 

The value of properties have steadily increased in value in recent years, except for a decrease in 2008. 

In 2013 their value was estimated at £4.7 trillion, over three times their estimated value in 1997 (£1.4 trillion), without removing the effects of inflation.

Between the end of 1997 and the end of 2013, the average house price increased by 234 per cent.

The value of other buildings - including warehouses, roads, railways, pipelines, bridges and sports stadiums - increased by £86 billion (5 per cent) to £1.7 trillion. 

Machinery, transport kit and ICT equipment rose in value by £14billion to £814billion. 

The value of central government has fallen dramatically in recent years to -£633billion in part caused by rising national debts

Elsewhere insurance, pension and standardised guarantee schemes were worth £3.1 trillion while cash and savings were worth £1.4 trillion.

Growing national debt means wiped £158billion off the value of the UK, the amount that the government owes more than it owns in assets.

Central government net worth has fallen every year since 2001. Without removing the effects of inflation, central government’s estimated net worth was minus £663 billion at the end of 2013, a decrease of 0.2 per cent on the previous year and over eight times less than its net worth in 2006 (£82 billion).
