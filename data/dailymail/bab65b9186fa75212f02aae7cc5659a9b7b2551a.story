Children in detention on Christmas Island are sick and distressed with many wetting the bed and having flashbacks, according to the Australian Human Rights Commission.

Gillian Triggs, president of the Commission, inspected the detention centre last week and said conditions have deteriorated since she was last there four months ago.

A high majority of the 174 child asylum seekers were sick and many had developed speech impediments.

'Almost all of them, including the adults, were coughing, were sick, were depressed, unable to communicate, were weak,' Ms Triggs told the ABC.

'Some of them (are) not leaving their cabins, are not eating.

'But the other thing that was distressing was the mental decline - children who wouldn't even make eye contact.'

Ms Triggs who was accompanied by paediatrician Professor Elizabeth Elliott said she and her team interviewed hundreds of detainees over three days as part of a national inquiry into the mandatory detention of children seeking asylum in Australia.

There was also an unprecedented rate of self-harm among children, with 128 reported cases of children self-harming at the detention centre in the last 15 months, according to Ms Triggs.

While there's almost half the number of children at Christmas Island compared to the last visit in March, Ms Elliott said that there is still too many under current conditions.

'Christmas Island is no place for young children,' she said.

'(There were) boys aged 14 to 17 who had seen violence such as shooting and abduction of relatives at home and were now in the detention centre and really felt that they had no future.'

Immigration Minister Scott Morrison said in a statement the department was drawing down the numbers of child detainees.

'The number of children in held detention has declined by over 35 per cent under this government, from more than 1,300 at the time of the election down to 849, and the number of children in detention on Christmas Island has been reduced by more than 60 per cent,' the statement read.

'The government reiterates its intention to reduce the number of children in detention to return to what it was under the Howard government. Just before the Labor came to government there were no... children in (immigration) detention.'
