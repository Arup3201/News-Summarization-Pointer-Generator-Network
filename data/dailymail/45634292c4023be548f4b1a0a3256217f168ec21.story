A clergyman who suddenly resigned from a church post explained: ‘God made me do it.’

Father Timothy Lipscomb said he received a ‘message from above’ while delivering a sermon at Preston Minster, Lancashire. 

It triggered his abrupt exit from the role of Area Dean, a managerial-type position in which he oversaw clergy in the region.

Puzzled: Father Timothy Lipscomb (pictured) said: ‘It’s a busy role and takes up a lot of time. But God clearly doesn’t want me to do it any more.'I’m not quite sure why. I really wish I knew'

Father Timothy, the vicar of Preston, said: ‘I was in church in the middle of a sermon and I felt like God shouted at me to give up being Area Dean.

‘I went to see the Bishop about it and he asked me if I didn’t like the job. I said, ‘‘Yes, I do.”

‘But you can’t go against the will of God, can you? So I have given it up.’

Father Timothy handed over the reins to the Rev Brian McConkey of Christ Church, Fulwood, Lancashire, last week after 16 years as Area Dean. 

He is to continue in his primary role as the vicar of Preston. 

He said: ‘I’ve enjoyed my time in the job – Area Dean is a sort of line manager for clergy in the area.

‘It’s a busy role and takes up a lot of time. But God clearly doesn’t want me to do it any more.

'I’m not quite sure why. I really wish I knew. Perhaps He feels I’ve done enough. 

'People have been asking me if I’m ill, or if I’ve had enough. But it’s not like that at all. 

'It was strange really – similar to when I was called to the priesthood. It was that sort of experience. I really don’t know what His thinking was.’
