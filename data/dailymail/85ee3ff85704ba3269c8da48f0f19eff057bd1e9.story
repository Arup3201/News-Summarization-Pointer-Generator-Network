An Indonesian flight attendant, who is listed as working on board the missing AirAsia flight, tweeted a  message of support to the victims of the MH17 disaster just months before his own plane disappeared en route to Changi, Singapore.

Mr Desano, whose Twitter account stated that he spent Christmas Day relaxing in a jacuzzi with a friend, issued an eerie tweet earlier in the year to the victims of Malaysian Airline MH17, which was shot out of the sky in July.
