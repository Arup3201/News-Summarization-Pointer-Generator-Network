The Duchess of Cambridge may have access to a collection of dazzling jewels that date back hundreds of years, but the style chameleon is famed for championing modern and fashionable designers.

Last night was case in point. Kate pulled out all the stops at a glamorous black tie event at London’s Natural History Museum and accessorised her powder blue Jenny Packham gown with dazzling jewels by Monica Vinader.

The 32-year-old Duchess wore the £745 Riva Diamond Cluster Drop Earrings and £1,000 Riva Diamond Cluster Bib by the jewellery designer.

Other fans of the brand include fashionistas Sienna Miller, Emma Watson, Olivia Palermo, Cara Delevingne, Suki Waterhouse and Cheryl Fernandez Versini. 

Monica Vinader is a Spanish-born British designer who mastered her craft whilst living in Santa Fe, New Mexico.

After settling in Norfolk, England, Monica started her jewellery business as a bespoke service, creating one-off pieces, by hand, out of her converted forge. 

As the business has scaled, Norfolk remains at the heart of the design process, where she and her creative team develop all of the collections.

Production takes place in India, where every stone is cut and faceted by hand from rough, using contemporary cuts, meaning your piece of Monica Vinader jewellery is entirely unique.

'Monica Vinader is for everyone: easy-to-wear, contemporary pieces to style, stack and personalise with engraving,' she told MailOnline.

It's hardly surprising that fashion-forward Kate is a fan of the range; acclaimed designer Caroline Issa directed the new campaign. 

Everything the Duchess of Cambridge wears turns to gold so Monica is sure to see sales sky rocket as a result.

Undoubtedly the best-known item in Kate's jewellery collection is her £28,500 engagement ring, which once belonged to Princess Diana. The blue sapphire, which sparkles with 14 diamonds, was bought at the former Crown jewellers Garrard of Mayfair for a staggering £28,500.

When it comes to choosing her own accessories, Kate does, however, prefer more simple pieces like her £1,090 Annoushka Pearl Drop earrings and more modest £275 Links Hope earrings.

She's even a fan of cheap but chic jewellery, which she snapped up from Made In Chelsea star Amber Atherton's myflashtrash website and wore while on her Diamond Jubilee tour of the South Pacific.

Kate hand-picked seven different pieces, including earrings, bracelets, and necklaces, from the company that is run by the E4 reality TV star.

Founder Amber told MailOnline: 'We are over the moon that Kate has been supporting British business by wearing trinkets from myflashtrash.com.'

In 2012, Kate wore a delicate pair of imitation diamond-and-pearl earrings to the Diamond Jubilee service at St Paul’s Cathedral.

The £48 fake pearl and cubic zirconia earrings were part of a range of jewellery sold on her website Heavenly Necklaces - an online business selling convincing, understated fake jewels.

Kate's chronic antenatal sickness has meant she has not been seen in public for more than seven weeks. 

But last night the Duchess of Cambridge, at 13 weeks pregnant, proved she still has the power to dazzle.

Earlier in the day, Kate, 32, who is expecting her second child with Prince William in April, had returned to work with a ceremonial welcome to mark the State Visit of the president of Singapore.

She looked as stylish as ever – if a touch on the peaky side – as she undertook her first official engagement since early August, dressed in a made-to-measure check Alexander McQueen coat that hid any hint of her blossoming pregnancy.

In her grey Jane Taylor hat and her vertiginous black Prada heels – completed with £1,090 Annoushka pearl earrings – she and William towered over the diminutive president Tony Tan Keng Yam and his wife Mary.

Kate admitted she was ‘delighted to be out of the house’ after being laid low for weeks by hyperemesis gravidarum, the chronic antenatal sickness that saw her hospitalised while she was expecting her now 15-month-old son, Prince George.
