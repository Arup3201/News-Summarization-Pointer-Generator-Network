A criminal out on bail beat an elderly woman to death, stole her engagement and wedding rings and then used them to propose to his girlfriend, prosecutors said yesterday.

Raymond Harris, 36, showed off Virginia 
Perillo's rings at a party just hours after an 
attack last month that left the OAP unconscious and bleeding in her Chicago garage.

Former nurse Perillo, 73, was rushed to a hospital but declared brain dead. She died two days later.

According to the Cook County State's Attorney's Office, Harris asked friends at the party which of the two rings he should present when he asked his girlfriend to marry him.

They said he wound up giving her both when he proposed a week later.

Police arrested Harris, who was paroled in May after serving 13 years of a 30-year sentence for attempted murder and aggravated arson, as a suspect in the killing after they found a bloody watch in her car.

Tests showed a match with Harris' DNA, which was already held in a law enforcement database.

His fiance subsequently turned the rings over to police.

Harris, from Carpentersville, Illinois, was charged yesterday with murder and armed robbery in Perillo's death. He is being held without bail.

In 1997, just weeks after he was released from jail on an armed robbery conviction, Harris invaded the home of a woman, beating and raping her repeatedly over several hours, prosecutors said.

Harris then slit the victim's throat, knocked her unconscious and set her house on fire. The woman woke up with her legs in flames and suffered third-degree burns but survived.
