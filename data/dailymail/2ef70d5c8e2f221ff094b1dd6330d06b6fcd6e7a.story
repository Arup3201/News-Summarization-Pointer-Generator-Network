Two years ago, Wu Mu Xiang was inconsolable following the death of her 26-year-old son. 

But after the heartbreak of losing her only child, the 57-year-old became a mother again after giving to twin babies, the People's Daily reported. 

In a rare move for China - which enforces a one-child policy - a hospital agreed to give Mrs Wu and her 60-year-old husband IVF treatment.

Wu Mu Xiang, 57, and her 60-year-old husband cradle their twins after she gave birth following IVF treatment

Twins En En and Dian Dian were born two months early and were placed on the neonatal intensive care unit

Mrs Wu and her husband used up all their savings on the IVF treatment and even borrowed money from friends but never revealed what their plans were

Mrs Wu said the births of En En and Dian Dian had given her the strength to live on after the tragedy of losing her only son, Wu Jianyu on February 27, 2013. 

He passed away just eight months before his wedding day after being diagnosed with acute cerebral thrombosis. 

Following his death, Mrs Wu lost the will to live, hardly ever speaking and often crying in bed. She even suggested her husband try to have a child with another woman. 

After he rejected the idea, they thought of IVF  and the Fujian Province hospital agreed to give them the treatment.

Mrs Wu and her husband used up all their savings on the IVF treatment and even borrowed money from friends but never revealed what their plans were. 

On January 21 this year, Mrs Wu was taken to Shaowu hospital but after two days was transferred to the Fujian Province hospital. 

Three days later, she gave birth to the twins at the age of 57 following a caesarean section. Son En En was born three minutes before his sister Dian Dian.  

Because the twins were born two months early, they were placed in the neonatal intensive care unit.  

Despite the pain from her operation, Mrs Wu would still brave the five floors of the hospital to see her children. 

She now awaits their safe transfer from hospital where they will be raised by her and her 60-year-old husband.
