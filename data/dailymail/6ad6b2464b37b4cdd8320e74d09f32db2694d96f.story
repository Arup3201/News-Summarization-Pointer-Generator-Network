An endangered Siberian tiger released into the wild by Vladimir Putin has attacked a hen house in northern China and eaten five chickens.

Satellite tracking showed the rare Amur cat swam across a river - evidently in search of a Chinese meal after a shortage of its staple of deer in eastern Russia.

The Russians alerted Beijing through diplomatic channels amid fears angry farmers in Heilongjiang province might shoot the tiger which is named Kuzya.

Russian president Vladimir Putin works with a conservationist to put a collar on Kuzya who has escaped to northern China where he attacked a hen house and ate five chickens 

Kuzya was one of three Siberian tigers released by Putin in a remote part of the Amur region in May 

The 19-month-old cub was one of three Siberian tigers released by Putin in a remote part of the Amur region in May.

Only Kuzya defected to China. The others remain in Russia according to tracking signals.

Kuzya attacked a farm in Heilongjiang province's Luobei county, according to the official Xinhua News Agency.

Animal remains were found near the tiger's tracks, and feathers and blood near the smashed henhouse.

The big cat was spotted earlier this month in Taipinggou nature reserve in Heilongjiang province and some 60 cameras have been set up in a bid to track him.

Chen Zhigang, the nature reserve director, said a Russian expert had alerted him to Kuzya's location and had 'expressed hope that we can protect it'. 

The Russian's alerted Beijing of Kuzya's border crossing through diplomatic channels 

The attack was reported as Putin praised the growing friendship between Russia and its 'natural ally' China.

The president told Chinese premier Li Keqiang during talks at the Kremlin.'We are natural partners, natural allies, we are neighbours,'

'We are setting large-scale, absolutely realistic goals for ourselves and no doubt this will serve our peoples well.'

Russia is keen to embrace its eastern neighbour because of its plummeting popularity with the West, especially over the Ukraine crisis.

It was not immediately clear if Putin  - an avid campaigner to save the endangered species - raised the subject of his rampant tiger during the talks.

However, the foreign ministry in Beijing pledged that Kuzya would be protected, citing an existing agreement on cross-border protection of Siberian tigers.

'We will make joint efforts with the Russian side to protect wild Siberian tigers which travel back and forth between China and Russia,' explained spokesman Hong Lei said in a statement.

Earlier Russian ecologists expressed fears for the animal in China.

Vasiliy Gorobeiko, deputy head of natural resources management in the Jewish Automomous Republic in eastern Russia - where the tiger was roaming before he swam across the Amur River - said China was more populated and he could be shot for worrying farm animals.

'Certainly, China will be informed about President Putin's tiger via Foreign Affairs ministry channels but time is needed for this information to reach local ecologists, and before then the tiger may well alarm the local villagers and may even suffer,' he said at the time.

'Kuzya knows how to avoid people and did so well in Russia but in that agricultural area of China, it will be hard for him.'

'We can only hope that Kuzya changes his mind and swims back to Russia as soon as possible, while the river is not iced over,' said Novaya Gazeta newspaper in covering the animal's defection to China.

The Siberian tiger, also known as Amur tiger, is on the Red List of Threatened Species.

In 2010, Russia launched a national strategy to protect the Siberian tiger, the largest of the five tiger species. According to World Wildlife Fund, some 450 Siberian tigers left on the planet.

Putin was recently behind the unveiling of a computer animated tiger cub as a new character on Russia's longest-running children's TV programme.
