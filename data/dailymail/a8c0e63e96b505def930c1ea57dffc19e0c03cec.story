Prepared: Despite concerns about his fitness, gold medal hopeful Phillips Idowu says he is ready and raring to go ahead of this weeks Olympic triple jump

He has been dubbed Britain's 'invisible man' after seemingly severing contact with his coach and the outside world.

But despite concerns about his fitness, gold medal hopeful Phillips Idowu says he is ready and raring to go ahead of this week's Olympic triple jump.

Ever since the 33-year-old failed to join Team GB at a training camp in Portugal last month, there have been concerns over whether he would appear at the Games.

Last week, Britain's head coach Charles van Commenee even accused the star of 'turning his back' on his trainer. And he has not been seen in the Olympic village with the other competitors.

But the silver medalist at the Beijing Olympics has been tracked down to a north London sports centre where has been training.

Speaking to The Sunday Times, he said: 'I've been training every day. The game is around the corner. I can't afford to not train.'

Idowu has not competed since June after picking up a foot injury in America.

The London-born star also released a full statement on Twitter yesterday, insisting he had not disappeared.

He said: 'I'm in London where I have been for the last few wks (sic), finalising my prep and receiving therapy, My coach knew about this and it has not been a secret.

'I have to give notification of my whereabouts everyday for doping purposes, so impossible to completely disappear.

'The appropriate people can contact me with ease. There is no story here at all.

'I've only heard about the hysteria about my whereabouts today as I've been on a media lockdown, I'm into the village on Sunday as was planned months ago.'Â 

Worries: Ever since the 33-year-old failed to join Team GB at a training camp in Portugal last month, there have been concerns over whether he would appear at the Games

Despite insisting that he has been working with his coaching team, according to The Sunday Times there was no sign of his trainer Aston Moore as he trained at New River Sports Centre in Wood Green.

The triple-jumper will no doubt be keen to follow on with the already astonishing success of Team GB.

Britain's best Olympic day in a century took place yesterday with Team GB triumphing in six separate events at London 2012.

It started with the men's coxless four team and women's lightweight double sculls, who topped the podium in front of an ecstatic Eton Dorney crowd early in the day.

Motivation: The triple-jumper will no doubt be keen to follow on with the already astonishing success of Team GB in the Olympic Stadium

Their double gold became a triple triumph when the women's team pursuit cyclists stormed to victory in the Velodrome at world record pace, before GB's athletics stars capped a remarkable day in the Olympic Stadium.

Jessica Ennis, the poster girl of British athletics, destroyed the field in the 800m to become Olympic heptathlon champion, long jumper Greg Rutherford claimed gold minutes later before Mo Farah powered to 10,000m glory late on.
