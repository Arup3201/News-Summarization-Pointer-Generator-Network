Jihadist: Mohammed Hadi, 18, is believed to be fighting with Isis in Syria

A radicalised schoolboy thought to be fighting in Syria for the Isis jihadist army was bought a plane ticket to the war-torn region by his mosque, it has been claimed.

Mohammed Hadi, 18, dubbed Osama Bin Bieber, left Coventry in the West Midlands for Syria earlier this year and is now thought to be in Iraq.

The boy - nicknamed after the Canadian popstar because of his youthful looks - posted pictures of himself in desert combat gear armed with twin pistols, saying that he was fighting with Isis (the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant).

But, according to Hadi's mother, he had no means of paying for transport to the Syrian border with his £14 per week pocket money - and she believes religious leaders may have funded his journey.

Speaking to The Sun on Sunday, she said: They have arranged for this - his flights. They've paid for his ticket - there is no other way'.

'He had no job. He is just a boy - he had money for soft drinks and to get the bus, no more. I don't know if he'll ever come back alive.'

The mosque in question was not named, and a cleric thought to be involved refused to answer questions. Hadi also attended a religious school, or madrassa, which last week said it called police as soon as it discovered the Hadi's extremist leanings.

Last week his father, 38-year-old Mahir Hadi, said the family had no idea where their son was. Family members headed to the Turkish border with Syria in the hope of hearing word of him, but have found nothing.

Hadi is thought to have left for Turkey with friends Rasheed Amani and Ali Kharisani and headed on through Syria to Iraq. They are among around 500 British jihadists thought to have joined the fighting currently devastating the countries.

Twitter 
users have reported that Hadi, also known as Abu Yahya Al Kurdy, is 
currently near the northern Syrian town of Sarrin with a group of 
Chechens.

Some Twitter users have dubbed the teenager 'Osama Bin Bieber' because he looks so young. He also calls himself Abu Yahya Al Kurdy

Meanwhile, Nova K. Doski, a London-based
 Kurd, posted: 'I'm still laughing at this toddler. I said from the 
start he will become a terrorist.'

A
 Coventry local said he saw the teenager's father in tears after 
discovering what he had done. He said: 'He was so frightened that he 
would die out there.'

An imam at a religious school, or madrassa, confirmed Hadi did attend. But he said that when he discovered his 
plans to travel to the strife-hit region he called West Midlands Police.

Recruitment: Isis posted a video showing British men urging others to take up arms and join them

A
 police spokesman last week said: 'Police are investigating the whereabouts of an 
18-year-old man from the Stoke Heath area of Coventry as a result of 
concerns raised by family members. The man was last seen on 26 March.

'Officers
 are keeping an open mind as to the man’s whereabouts; however the 
investigation is being led by officers from the West Midlands Counter 
Terrorism Unit and one line of enquiry is that he has travelled to 
Syria.'

Dr
 Abdullah Shehu, who chairs the Coventry Muslim Forum, told the Coventry
 Telegraph he did not know of any local people who have travelled to 
Syria to join ISIS.

He
 said: 'This is something that the Coventry Muslim Forum have morally 
condemned. We advise people never to engage in such a practice at all.

'We work closely with the police and with the council in order to prevent these actions.'

The news 
about Hadi comes soon after two Britons were seen in an ISIS recruitment
 video urging other British Islamists to join their holy war.

Reyaad
 Khan, 20, sits with a Kalashnikov assault rifle against his shoulder 
alongside 20-year-old gap-year student Nasser Muthana – also seen in the
 video urging Britons to join ISIS militants in Iraq and Syria.

Nasser had taken £100 from his father to go on an Islamic seminar in Shrewsbury in November, but instead went to Syria.

Three
 months later his brother Aseel, 17, left the house saying he was going 
to a friend’s for the night, but the following evening it transpired 
that Aseel had obtained a second passport by lying about his age and was
 in Cyprus, travelling to Syria.

Police
 across the UK have made 65 Syria-related arrests over the last 18 
months, including 40 in the first three months of this year alone.
