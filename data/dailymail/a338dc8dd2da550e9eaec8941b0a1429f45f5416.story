Pippa Middleton seemed to put her recent career troubles behind her today as she soaked up the spring sunshine in Chelsea.  

The brunette was strolling on the fashionable King's Road wearing a smart navy blazer, accessorised with huge sunglasses, a leopard print scarf and one of her signature designer tote bags.

And locals in the south-west London borough seemed to be enjoying soaking up the view, too.

Like the rest of the world, the Middleton family must be counting down the days until the Duchess of Cambridge's due date. But it looks her sister Pippa Middleton is well prepared to carry all of the baggage that will accompany Royal Baby number 2!

Looking as sophisticated as ever, Pippa accessorized her skinny jeans and double breasted blazer with a Mercy Delta blue leopard print scarf, a pair of slipper shoes by Jemima Vine and this to die for tote bag, which is by Milli Millu.

The idea behind this British brand is to fuse fashion and function, creating bags that fit all your essentials. Featuring labelled interior compartments such as 'My phone' and 'My papers' to keep everything organised, we love the front pocket and gold lock on this so-called Luxembourg style.

It's only the second time the 31-year-old has been spotted out since reports emerged that her dreams of a U.S. television career have come crashing down. 

The Duchess of Cambridge's sister had been in talks to join American TV station NBC as a 'special correspondent', but negotiations for the £400,000 role disintegrated after she was deemed not to have a 'breezy' enough manner.

On Friday the 31-year-old stunned in ice-blue Hugo Boss gown at the Disability SnowSport UK Ball, her Mustique tan and dazzling smile hiding what must be serious heartbreak at her latest career effort stalling.

It's only the second time the 31-year-old has been spotted out since reports emerged that negotiations with U.S. television network NBC have been cancelled

The brunette chose a £475 tote bag by Milli Millu, flat suede pumps and a leopard print scarf for her day out

The Vanity Fair Contributing Editor and Ocado magazine columnist, who was catapulted to fame following her sister's wedding to Prince William in 2011, has long been keen to make a name for herself in the U.S.

But a source close to NBC says Pippa’s screen trial, which can be watched online, was a flop.

In the clip the writer looked uncomfortable as she danced with an aged local in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, for no ascertainable reason. And came across as ‘a bit grand, awkward and bored, rather than enthusiastic’, according to one insider. ‘Cringe-worthy’ said another.

Not that you would know it from her December 2014 column for the Spectator. Excitedly describing her visit to Wyoming, Pippa gushed about her experience of line-dancing and talked of the 'stunning' mountain scenery.

'Wyoming is real cowboy country,' she continued. 'Everyone wore cowboy boots and the men had big, non-ironic moustaches that curled upwards.'

Not one to claim the laurels undeserved, she cheerfully admitted to being less than brilliant and worried she might have scuppered her chances of appearing on Strictly Come Dancing.

'It’s easy to get carried away with the whole free-riding atmosphere. My dance partner was about 80, and I did my best to keep up,' she continued.

'But it turns out I have two left feet, at least as far as moving to rhythm is concerned.' NBC apparently agreed.

Ultimately NBC, it is said, was keen not to repeat the expensive mistake it made a couple of years back with Chelsea Clinton. They were concerned that by spending a lot of money on a famous-by-association personality with no apparent aptitude for TV presenting, they would look gullible when that person failed to produce ratings. 

Friends of Pippa say she didn’t want to move to the U.S. anyway as it would be too far away from Nico Jackson, the 37-year-old investment banker she’s been dating since 2012, who now lives in Geneva.

And today she seemed to be keepng a low profile as she strolled around her favourite shopping haunt toting a £475 bag by Millli Millu.
