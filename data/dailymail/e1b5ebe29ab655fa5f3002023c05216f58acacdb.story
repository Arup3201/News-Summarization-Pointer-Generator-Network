The Olympic champion sprinter Usain Bolt- dubbed the fast man on the planet - shocked his fans by losing a race yesterday.

The 26-year-old Jamaican, who holds the world 100m record, came second in a 100m sprint in Rome to 31-year-old American sprinter, Justin Gatlin.

Bolt, who finished in 9.95 seconds compared to Gatlin's 9.94, has not lost a 100m race since 2010, when he was suffering from a back injury.

The shock defeat occurred last night at the Rome Golden Gala Diamond League meeting in front of thousands of spectators.

Bolt, who holds the current world record after running the 100m in 9.58 seconds in 2009, started the race well, but then stumbled and could not regain his lead on Gatlin, a former drugs cheat.

Afterwards Bolt, who refers to himself as 'a legend', tried to shrug off his performance as a jubilant Gatlin danced around the track to celebrate his victory. 

Bolt told reporters: 'The one-offs are never for me. It’s all about the World Championships. I’ve got two months to get it right.

‘You learn more from losing. You can’t win every race in your career, I’ve learnt that.

‘For me Rio will be biggest Games of my life. That’s where I’m going to make history if possible (by becoming) the three times Olympic (100m and 200m) champion, which has never been done. I want to go out there for my legend status.

‘For me, it’s just going through the season and putting things together for the World Championships. The season is still very early. I am not surprised. I have time – I’m not worried.'

Gatlin, who has twice tested positive for drugs and served a four-year ban, had warned Bolt and his Jamaican team-mate Yohan Blake before the race to 'expect a dogfight'.

Afterwards he said: '‘It felt good. It’s an honour to be able to race against him and compete against him. He’s an inspiration for the sport. He’s inspired me to be a better runner and a better entertainer for the fans.

‘I just want to be able to give him some competition when he’s at top form. He’s a legend and I want to go out and just fight for the end. Much respect.’
