Are you on your third diet of the year? Are your kitchen cupboards filled with low calorie, low taste foods? Is your sexy gym kit gathering dust in the corner?

If so then you are not alone. Britain's yo-yo dieters will not only try 15 different weight loss plans over 30 years but, they'll spend £105,000 trying and failing to shape up as well.

A new survey has revealed that 60 per cent of yo-yo dieters will try 10-20 diets in a lifetime. The 30-year sum of £105,000 breaks down to £3,500 a year or £30 a week on trying to lose weight.

These dieters will spend £1,500 a year on fitness classes, 
gym gear and memberships to try and slim down.

The remaining £2,000 will be spent on branded diet plans, including programme fees, fad foods and diet supplements.

The poll was published by the team behind new book The IntoTrim Plan: How to Keep the Weight 
off Forever.

 and dieting expert Natasha Hurst said: 'We all know that yo-yo dieting is bad for 
your health, but it appears from this study that it can and does have a 
disastrous effect on your wallet, too.

The IntoTrim Plan by nutritionist Natasha Hurst

'The
 reality is that diets can be hit and miss, but when they do work, 
slimmers often lack the knowledge to succeed at maintaining their weight
 loss.

'Once
 you’ve achieved your target weight there’s usually little support and 
advice for maintaining that slimmer figure and it’s no wonder many women
 get trapped in an endless cycle of yo-yo dieting.

'For
 most people, however, maintaining that weight loss once they do reach 
their goal weight can actually be achieved from a balanced diet alone 
and needn’t cost the earth.'

Dieters admitted to feeling trapped in an 'endless cycle' of yo-yo dieting, in search of the perfect way to lose weight.

The annual spend was aimed at losing an average target of 24lbs.

The women polled were also found to buy 
new clothes and pamper themselves with beauty regimes to, 'showcase my 
new, fitter body.'

Ms Hurst, added: 'It is clear from the cross-section of women we surveyed that dieting plays an integral role to many women’s lives.

'95 per cent of the women we questioned conceded that they would spend 30 years on some sort of weight loss scheme or another.

'Given the sacrifices they make throughout their lives continually dieting, along with the money they spent repeatedly losing weight, I think it’s safe to say that this is not good value for money.

'It’s far, far cheaper - and much more effective - to take a little time to address bad habits and learn how to eat not just for a diet, but for a lifetime.'
