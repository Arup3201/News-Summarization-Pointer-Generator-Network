George Zimmerman revealed his dramatic weight gain during his latest court appearance today as a judge denied his attorney's request to let some witnesses testify in private.

Photographs taken inside the courtroom show the former neighborhood watch officer is drastically heavier than he was in mugshots taken after he gunned down Trayvon Martin last year.

Zimmerman, who has been in hiding since his arrest, appeared in court on Thursday as his lawyer asked the judge for some witnesses to give their testimony out of the public eye.

Defense attorney Mark O'Mara said the witnesses have concerns for their safety about testifying at Zimmerman's trial, which starts next week.

Changed: George Zimmerman, who has been in hiding since his arrest for the killing of Trayvon Martin, arrives in Seminole circuit court for a hearing on Thursday - revealing his dramatic weight gain

O'Mara said that the seven witnesses he wanted to keep hidden include one eyewitness to the altercation between Zimmerman and Martin on the night of February 26, 2012.

He said their testimony could impact the jury's decision, but prosecutors and attorneys for media groups objected to the request.

Prosecutor John Guy had opposed the request, explaining it might be 'alarming and confusing to a juror and might otherwise highlight their testimony when it shouldnâ€™t be highlighted'.

O'Mara also called Ben Kruidbos, a former IT director in the state prosecutor's office, to the stand.

The defense claims Kruidbos is a whistleblower who revealed deleted texts, photographs, and video found on the teenager's phone which prosecutors failed to disclose to the defense.

The information includes Martin possibly holding a gun and smoking marijuana.

With the photos and text messages, Zimmerman's attorneys hope to show 
that Martin wasn't the 'angel' he's been made out to be by his family, 
attorneys, and the media, but rather an experienced fighter who used 
drugs.

O'Mara also told the judge that Martin's marijuana use and past fighting
was central to the argument that Zimmerman used self-defense when he 
confronted Martin last year at a gated community in Sanford, Florida.

'We have a lot of evidence that marijuana use had something to do with 
the event,' O'Mara said. 'It could have affected his behavior.'

Rejection: Circuit Judge Debra Nelson talks with defense and prosecuting attorneys at the pre-trial hearing. She denied a request from Zimmeman's attorney Mark O'Mara, left, to allow confidential testimony

But the judge ruled that the photos, 
messages and social media records cannot be mentioned in Zimmerman's 
opening statement, although they could be looked at later in the trial.

An
attorney for Martin's family, Benjamin Crump, said the teen's parents 
were pleased with the judge's rulings. 'Trayvon Martin is not on trial,'
Crump said.

Circuit Judge Debra Nelson also refused to allow jurors to travel to the
shooting scene during trial, and rejected a defense request to delay 
the trial set to begin June 10.

The judge called the request to let jurors see the crime scene 'a logistical nightmare.'

Killed: Trayvon Martin, 17, was unarmed when he was shot dead as he walked home in February 2012

Zimmerman, 29, is pleading not guilty, claiming he shot the unarmed teenager in February 2012 in self-defense when the boy fought with him and went to grab his gun, he said.

A delay in Zimmerman's arrest led to protests nationwide. Martin was black. Zimmerman's father is white, and his mother is Hispanic.

Jury selection begins on Monday. The trial is expected to last more than a month.
