A fantasy series it may be but Game of Thrones is a decidedly adult drama.

Dominated by dragons, duplicity and dastardly deeds, the world of Westeros has gripped viewers with its tales of fueding families and illicit love affairs.

However, for the 6.9million Chinese viewers who tuned in to watch the show's second season on state television, it wasn't quite what they expected.

The show is known for quite graphic love scenes between its characters but these have been largely edited out for the official Chinese broadcast

Its adult themes and complex relationships form a large part of the show's appeal but Chinese viewers claim much of this depth is lost in the edited version

A dubbed and edited version of the popular HBO show - with much of the violence and nudity removed - began airing last weekend, drawing ire from audiences, many who have already seen the complete version of the show through the internet.

The first season was shown back in 2012, with much the same editing policy, but the new broadcast still angered many viewers.

One disgruntled Thrones fan posted on Chinese social networking site Weibo: 'I estimate that they cut about twenty minutes. The story feels discontinuous… my first reaction was "This can’t be!" Then my second reaction was, "My God, what a mess".'

While another complained: 'So they’ve cut about a quarter of all the fight scenes, then a quarter of the nude scenes. What is it...a medieval European castle documentary?'

Fight scenes also form a major part of the fantasy epic but have again been largely edited

CCTV, the state broadcaster, also came under fire for its decision to air the show with dialogue dubbed into Putonghua - the standard Chinese dialect.

SCMP.com reports that one viewer complained on social media that '[This dub] really makes [Game of Thrones] sound like a Taiwanese drama. I’m boycotting all dubbed versions of American TV, CCTV can go to hell.'

The move follows a week of controversy for Chinese broadcasters, which, as part of the Chinese government's 'Cleaning the Web' initiative, have removed popular US shows - including the Big Bang Theory, The Good Wife, NCIS and The Practice - from video streaming sites.

The Peoples' Daily newspaper, the regime's official mouthpiece, justified the decision, saying it was necessary to protect the public from 'negative effects and hidden security dangers'.

CCTV also later announced it had bought the rights to re-air The Big Bang Theory and that a 'healthy' edit would be broadcast in the near future.
