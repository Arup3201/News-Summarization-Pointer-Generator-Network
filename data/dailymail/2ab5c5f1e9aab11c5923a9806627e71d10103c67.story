The possession of small amounts of marijuana has become legal in Washington DC, escalating the row between the city's mayor and Congress.

The new law came into force at midnight and allows anyone over the age of 21 to possess 2oz of cannabis and grow up to six plants in their home.

This is despite warnings from Republicans in congress that the city's mayor Muriel Bowser had exceeded her powers by legalizing the drug.

This is because the District of Columbia is not a state and is required to seek the OK from Congress for the majority of its legislation.

Congress tried to block the initiative by preventing funds from last year's national budget being used to enact the legalization.

But city hall officials claimed the move came too late to be valid as the referendum, backed by 65 per cent of voters, had already taken place.

'If you decide to move forward ... you will be doing so in knowing and willful violation of the law,' said Republican representative Jason Chaffetz warned in a letter to Ms Bowser.

Chaffetz chairs the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, which oversees legislative matters in Washington - the only Western capital whose residents are constitutionally denied a voting representative in their national legislature.

'You can go to prison for this,' Chaffetz reportedly told the Washington Post.

'We're not playing a little game here.'

But Ms Bowser said: 'Residents spoke loud and clear when they voted to legalize small amounts of marijuana in the District of Columbia. 

Earlier this week she added: 'We believe that we are acting lawfully. I have a lot to do here in the District of Columbia, so me being in jail won't be a good thing.' 

Only three times in four decades has Congress overturned a municipal law in Washington.

President Barack Obama's administration has stated that Washington ought to be able to run itself, regardless of its federal district status.

Washington DC is a a federal district and not a state.

As a result the constitution grants congress  the final say over the District of Columbia.

It can overturn local laws and exercises greater oversight of the city than exists for any state.

President Barack Obama's administration has stated that Washington ought to be able to run itself, regardless of its federal district status. 

The District also is in the unique position that it does not have a voting representative in congress.

'We do not believe that Congress should spend a lot of time interfering with the ability of the citizens of the District of Columbia to make decisions related to how they should govern their community.' White House spokesman Josh Earnest said in December.

The District of Columbia follows Colorado, Washington and Alaska who already allow recreational pot use, with Oregon set to follow in July.

Under the new law adults over 21 can possess no more than two ounces of cannabis and grow up to six cannabis plants at home.

The drug can only be smoked or taken in private. 

The sale of pipes, bongs and rolling papers will also be permitted, but the buying and selling of marijuana remains illegal.

Those caught smoking the drug in public will face up to 60 days in jail or $500 dollar fine. 

Despite the new law it will not apply to 29 per cent of the city that is under federal control.

This means that anyone can still be arrested for possession if they are on they are federal land, which includes the White House, Capitol Hill, military bases, and in national parks.

A total of 51 percent of Americans are said to be in favor of legalization, according to a Gallup poll in October.

'If the president can brew and drink beer in the White House, adults should be allowed to grow and consume a less harmful substance in their houses,' said Robert Capecchi of the Marijuana Policy Project.

'Alcohol is no longer the only authorized social lubricant in town. A safer alternative is legal for adults.' 

However, opponents worry that the government won't truly be able to regulate the marijuana industry to make sure sellers are distributing safe to use product. They're also concerned that it will lead to greater numbers of car accidents as high drivers take to the roads.
