There is no need to spend thousands of pounds on an exotic Australian holiday when a filmmaker has been and recorded it all for you.

The video A Year Through My Window followed French artist Boilerhum over an entire year as he drove more than 30 thousand kilometres with his camera around the world's largest island.

From the comfort of your computer you can journey from the Sydney Opera House to the wide open road and canyons of Western Australia and back to the east coast beaches and sand dunes in less than six minutes.

Scroll down for video

Iconic: The six-minutes video opens with Australia's most famous landmarks, the Sydney Opera House and the Sydney Harbour Bridge

Starting point: Australia's largest city, Sydney was where the filrmmaker began his ground tour of the world's biggest island

On the open road: The artist known as Boilerhum set off from the bright lights of Sydney around the whole coast of Australia, driving his van for a whole year

Picking up plenty of hitchhikers in his van along the way Boilerhum filmed his journey through five states - going surfing, attending a Tibetan procession in Melbourne, swimming in a deserted waterfall in Darwin and watching the sun set over the sea.

Landmarks like Sydney's Harbour Bridge and all its skyscrapers move quickly into the beautiful natural scences of the Great Ocean Road that leads to Melbourne, the first leg of the journey around the coast going south.

From sunkissed Sydney in New South Wales to rain lashing down in Perth in Western Australia, Boilerhum covered the entire mainland of Australia in less than six minutes of stunning video.

Stunning contrast: Boilerhum's video shows all the variety of a whole year-long trip around Australia, as he drove around the coast in a huge loop

Multicultural: Melbourne's festival for the Tibetan community of Victoria

Driving the Pacific Coast Touring Route down from Brisbane, past the Hunter Valley and Byron Bay, the video ends up with a dazzling sunset back in New South Wales.

If you have ever fancied backbacking around Australia this video of beaches, sunsets and surfing could tip you into action.

Time to start booking that summer holiday - or just enjoy the video.
