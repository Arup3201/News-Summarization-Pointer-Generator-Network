A U.S. Army sergeant will spend the rest of his life in a military prison for the slaughter of 16 Afghan villagers - one of the worst atrocities committed by U.S. soldiers during 12 years of war in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Staff Sgt. Robert Bales, 40, pleaded guilty in June to charges he killed the civilians in their huts during a nighttime rampage in March 2012. In exchange, prosecutors agreed not to pursue the death penalty.

On Friday, a military jury at Joint Base Lewis-McCord in Washington returned a sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole for the father of two.

However, furious Afghan survivors of the attack said they would be satisfied by nothing less than Bales' execution and said that they were unhappy he was allowed to escape with his life.

Life behind bars: Prosecutors said Robert Bales, 40, should have only one title for the rest of his life - 'prisoner'

Fury: The Afghan villagers who flew 7,000 miles to Washington state to testify against Bales said they would be satisfied with nothing less than the death penalty for Bales

Prosecutor Lieutenant Colonel Jay Morse, though, pushed for life in prison. 'He wiped out generations and he ruined 
lives forever. He should
be known by one official title from this day until the day he dies: 
inmate.'

Bales' mother, sitting in the front row 
of the court, bowed her head, rocked in her seat, and wept. An 
interpreter flashed a thumbs-up sign to a row of Afghans who 
were either injured or lost family members in the March 11, 2012 
attacks.

Bales himself, wearing a dress blue Army uniform, showed no expression as the sentence was handed down.

He became emotional yesterday as he 
testified that he was angry and afraid when he left his military outpost
and ventured alone into the village in Kandahar province in 
Afghanistan. The villagers he murdered were mostly women and children.

'I'm truly, truly sorry to those people whose families got taken away,' he said Thursday. 'I can't comprehend their loss. I think about it every time I look at my kids.'

Nine survivors from the Afghan village were flown to Washington state to testify against Bales. He said he hoped his apology would be translated for them. However, all of them decided to stay away from the court when Bales testified.

Bales said the massacre was 'an act of cowardice, adding: 'I'm a mass of fear and 
bulls*** and bravado.'

The
soldier, who was on his fourth deployment to a combat zone, said he was
mad at himself for being angry all the time, drinking too much and 
hiding his problems.

Bales
was nervous when he took the stand as the final witness in the hearing 
at which his lawyers have tried to paint a sympathetic picture of the 
soldier to contrast his own admissions and the testimony of angry Afghan
villagers about the horror he wrought.

Former
pro football player Marc Edwards testified as a character witness, 
telling jurors he remembered Bales as a great leader from their high 
school days in Norwood, Ohio.

Wearing the Super Bowl ring he won 
with the New England Patriots in 2002, Edwards said the slightly older 
Bales was an 'unbelievable leader' who 'took me under his wing' on their
high school team.

Bales was even magnanimous when Edwards took his position at starting linebacker, he said.

'He
came up to me after that practice kind of sheepishly,' said Edwards, 
who played nine years in the NFL. 'He says, "Hey Marc ... I want the 
team to be successful."'

The
jurors on Thursday also heard from an Army officer who served with 
Bales in Iraq. Major Brent Clemmer said it was unfathomable to learn 
that the competent, positive soldier he knew could have committed the 
atrocity.

'I walked myself into my office, poured myself a glass of scotch, and cried,' he said.

A brother of the soldier testified at
Bales' sentencing hearing, on Wednesday, portraying him as a patriotic 
American, high school class president and football team captain.

'There's no better father that I've seen,' William Bales, 55, said of his younger brother. 'If you brought the kids in here today, they'd run right to him.'

William Bales repeatedly referred to his sibling — once the captain of his high school football team and class president in Norwood, Ohio, where they grew up — as 'my baby brother' and 'Bobby.'

He described how as a teenager his brother cared for a developmentally disabled neighborhood boy, assisting him with basic life functions. The neighbor's father also testified about Bales' helpfulness.

'I don't know too many 16-, 17-year-old boys who could do that,' William Bales said.

On Tuesday afternoon and Wednesday morning, nine Afghan villagers who traveled about 7,000 miles to testify at the hearing in traditional garb spoke of their lives since the attacks.

Haji Mohammad Wazir lost 11 family members, including his mother, wife and six of his seven children.

He told the six-member jury that the attacks destroyed what had been a happy life. He was in another village with his youngest son, now 5-year-old Habib Shah, during the attack.

'If someone loses one child, you can imagine how devastated their life would be,' said Wazir, who received $550,000 in condolence payments from the U.S. government, out of $980,000 paid in all. 'If anybody speaks to me about the incident ... I feel the same, like it's happening right now.'

His son, now 5, 'misses everyone. He hasn't forgotten any of them.'

'I've gone through very hard times,' he added.

Wazir and a cousin, Khamal Adin, didn't get to say everything they wanted to in court. Each asked for permission to speak after the prosecutors' questions were finished, but the judge said it wasn't allowed.

Two military doctors testified Wednesday, describing the treatment of Bales' victims, including a young girl who had been shot in the head and spent three months undergoing surgeries and rehabilitation at a naval hospital in San Diego, relearning how to walk.

Bales' attorneys, who have said the soldier suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder, didn't cross-examine any of the Afghan witnesses.

Bales, a father of two from Lake Tapps, Washington, was serving his fourth combat deployment when he left the outpost at Camp Belambay in the pre-dawn darkness. He first attacked one village, returning to Belambay only when he realized he was low on ammunition, said prosecutor Lieutenant Colonel Jay Morse.

Bales then left to attack another village.

The massacre prompted such angry protests that the U.S. temporarily halted combat operations, and it was three weeks before Army investigators could reach the crime scene.

If he is sentenced to life with the possibility of parole, Bales would be eligible in 20 years, but there's no guarantee he would receive it. He will receive life with parole unless at least five of the six jurors say otherwise.
