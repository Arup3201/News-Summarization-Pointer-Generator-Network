In past years arriving students would have to make do with some money off vouchers and maybe a notebook if they were lucky.

However, Brunel undergraduate Computer Sciences students are set to get something far better when they arrive - their very own robot.

The School of Information Systems, Computing and Mathematics (SISCM) has provided 200 robots for first year students to take home, look after and experiment with throughout the year.

Students arriving at Brunel University will each be given a robot when they arrive. Lecturers hope it will help them become more engaged with their computing coursework

It is hoped that as well as giving them a chance to work on their practical skills outside the lab, the robots will enable students to compete with one another through tasks such as navigating obstacle courses.

This will culminate in a robot Olympics, to be held during the Spring Term.

Apart from moving in different directions, the robots (known as finches) have a beak that can change colour, an accelerometer so the orientation is known, IR sensors to detect obstacles, a light sensor, a thermocouple to determine temperature and a buzzer.

Professor Martin Shepperd, Undergraduate Programmes Director at SISCM, said: 'Teaching programming to novices is traditionally challenging so we came up with the novel idea of giving each student their own robot to help with their learning.

'The bonus of these finches is that they provide instant feedback - the student can see whether they respond as intended.

'If you write some code for the robot to turn left and it turns right then it's immediately apparent there's a problem.

'We also hope that because they are fun to work with, they will arouse studentsâ€™ curiosity and help them to gain a better understanding of the subject area.'

This is the first time such a large number robots have been given out to students in such a way.

The Finches, specifically designed by Carnegie Mellon University to support the teaching of computer science, have the advantage of being robust and affordable.

Although the idea is at the development stage SISCM also plan to take the robots into local schools, alongside first and second year students, to help support learning and encourage more children to think about taking up computer sciences.

The robots (known as finches) were developed by Carnegie Mellon University.

They have a 'beak' that can change 
colour, an accelerometer so the orientation is known, IR sensors to 
detect obstacles, a light sensor, a thermocouple to determine 
temperature and a buzzer.

They are plugged into a computer's USB port and can be programmed easily.
