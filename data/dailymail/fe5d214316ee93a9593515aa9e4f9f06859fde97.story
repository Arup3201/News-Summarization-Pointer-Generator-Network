It may not have been a string of spaghetti, but these two snakes certainly shared a loving moment - after they began eating the same meal at opposite ends.

In a scene reminiscent of the famous Bella Notte moment in Disney's Lady and the Tramp, the two Diamondback Rattlesnakes began to swallow a mouse only to realise they were both scoffing the same meal.

After a few moments of struggle the smaller snake gave up when it realised what was on the other end of the pray.Â 

Dinner time: The two snakes tussle over one mouse - ending up at either ends of the meal

The amusing moment was captured by wildlife photographer Paul Murray while on a trip to the Cradle of Humankind - a World Heritage Site in South Africa.

Mr Murray, from Pietermaritzburg, South Africa, said: 'My girlfriend and I had gone out for a viewing of South Africa's then-largest pride of White Lions at The Cradle Of Humankind, which on its own is amazing to see.

'It was my first time there and we got told they had a cave tour where people could interact with certain reptiles.So naturally, being up for anything, off we went.

'I'd never seen a Diamondback Rattlesnake eat anything, unfortunately I wasn't there in time to catch the kill but just in time to see the poised snake come out to investigate the rat, even though it was already halfway down the other's throat.

'The problem was that the snake on the right got the foot of the rat stuck in the one corner of his mouth, so couldn't get it down before the smaller snake on the left came sniffing and tasting.'

Mr Murray named the picture 'Dinner for Two' and says he is used to wildlife.

He added: 'I was fortunate to grow up in and around the South African bush so I've always been a 'bush monkey.'

'I love and respect everything that is nature and all the surprises it could bring at the blink of an eye.'
