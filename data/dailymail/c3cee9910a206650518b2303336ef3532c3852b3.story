The former San Diego State running back who mysteriously went missing this week after leaving the NFL Scouting Combine has been found, telling friends he spent days alone in a Florida airport under the instruction of God.

Adam Muema, 21, was found Thursday at the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport, ex-Oklahoma linebacker Corey Nelson confirmed to UT San Diego.

The airport is near the athlete performance facility where players spent the past two months training for the NFL.

Muema, the fourth leading rusher in Aztecs history, had not been seen or heard from since Sunday, when he left training saying that Lord had told him he'd play for the Seattle Seahawks if he took it easy.

Found: Former San Diego State running back Adam Muema, 21, had not been seen since leaving the NFL Scouting Combine on Sunday. He was located on Thursday at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport

Adam Muema has previously said that he speaks to God through numbers and that the Lord told him to leave the combine on Sunday for the benefit of his career

Adam Muema landed at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport on Monday afternoon. He is believed to have stayed there until Thursday, according to friend and fellow NFL star Corey Nelson

He said it was his 'dream' to play for the Super Bowl-winning team.

He then failed to show up in Florida.

Now it has emerged Muema had spent three nights in the Florida airport.

His Southwest flight had landed at 1.30pm Monday.

Muema made contact with Nelson on Thursday and asked him for a ride.

When Nelson arrived, he said Muema was still dressed in NFL-issued combine gear.

When asked to describe Muema’s demeanor on Thursday, Nelson said the running back seemed 'focused, cheerful and very wise'.

'He said he was at the airport for three days straight,' Nelson said.

'He was telling me when I picked him up that God told him to stay at the airport and don’t do anything. Just stay there. That’s what he did for three days straight.

'On the fourth day, he told me he couldn’t do it anymore. He decided to call me.'

Muema apparently tweeted this message after leaving the combine on Sunday

News that Muema had been found and was safe came as a relief to family and friends.

Source told UT San Diego his behavior at the annual combine was strange and religion-driven.

After leaving, he gave a phone interview from Indianapolis International Airport explaining his reasons.

The 21-year-old said he was 'following God' when choosing not to work out at the combine, told that if he skipped workouts, he'd fulfill his dream of playing for the Seattle Seahawks.

He also said he uses numbers to communicate with God and that he believes in Lord Rayel, a person who claims online to be the second coming of Christ.

After meeting with Nelson, Muema, who is from Covina, is believed to have left Florida on a flight to Los Angeles.

Nelson and Muema met in January at the same facility in Florida and bonded over religion, with both sharing a close relationship with God.

However Nelson says they have had to 'agree to disagree' over Muema's belief that Lord Rayel is the Messiah.

Raelism is a UFO religion founded and lead by Claude Vorilhon, now known as Rayel or Rael.

Rayel claims that on December 13, 1973, 
while riding his motorbike to his office in France, he met with extra 
terrestrials near a volcano who told him they had created humans in 
laboratories.

Muema is a believer in Lord Rayel, or Ra-El, who claims to be the Messiah after visiting another planet in 1975

In 1975 he claims to have met with them again and traveled to their planet.

These UFO' are called Elohim and Raelians believe messengers or prophets of the Elohim - such as Buddha and Jesus - were instructed to inform humans of each era.

Rayel claims to have received the final message of the Elohim and that his purpose is to inform the world about Elohim and, if humans become aware and peaceful enough, they could be welcomed by them.

Rayel said he was told to build an embassy near Jerusalem to spread the message of Elohim and the meaning of the universe.

Followers, such as Muema, believe him to be the Messiah.
