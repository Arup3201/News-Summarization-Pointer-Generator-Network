Roger Federer has hinted at retirement announcing he will miss next month’s French Open if it clashes with his wife giving birth to their third child saying: 'I've played enough tennis matches'.

Federer, 32, has played in every Grand Slam tournament since 2000 but has not won any since 2012 after suffering a dip in form. 

The Swiss tennis star and wife Mirka, who had twin daughters Charlene Riva and Myla Rose in 2009, announced on Christmas Eve they are expecting a third child.

Family first: Roger Federer said he will not play at the French Open if it means he'll miss his baby's birth

Happy couple: Federer with his wife, former tennis player Mirka, who is due to give birth to their third child

Speaking after beating 
Radek Stepanek 6-1, 6-2 in the second round of the Monte Carlo Masters he said: ‘It’s a
 priority for me trying to be there, to support my wife.

'I’ve played 
enough tennis matches. Missing a tournament or a match wouldn’t change 
anything for me.’

Federer has not revealed his wife's due date and said it was too early to say whether he would definitely play at the French Open, which begins on May 25th.

He added: 'As we don't know when it [the due date] is going to be yet, I'm happy playing at the moment.'

Federer has competed in 57 straight 
grand slam tournaments. He holds the record for the most ever grand slam
 wins with 17, three more than the next highest player Pete Sampras.

New addition: Mirka (right) and Federer already have identical twin daughters Myla and Charlene pictured here at Wimbledon in 2012

Easy choice: After beating Radek Stepanek at the Monte Carlo Masters Federer said missing one tournament wouldn't have a major bearing on his career

He
 also holds shares the Open Era records for most titles at the 
Australian Open with Andre Agassi and Novak Djokovic with four wins, at 
Wimbledon with Pete Sampras with seven wins and at the US Open with 
Jimmy Connors and Sampras with five wins.

But
 his last Grand Slam victory was at Wimbledon back in 2012 and he is now
 ranked fourth in the world sparking rumours he may be thinking about 
retirement.

If he does turn up in Paris, Federer will still hope 
to be bidding for an 18th Grand Slam title at the French Open, which 
takes place in Paris from May 25 to June 8.
