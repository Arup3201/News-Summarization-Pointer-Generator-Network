It is a secretive nation that is not known for its open and transparent nature.

But French photographer Eric Lafforgue was among the first visitors to be allowed to visit the North Korean fishing village of Jung Pyong Ri - a model community so remote it is not located on any maps.

The rural outpost is part of a project to create homestays for tourists, allowing them a glimpse of life in North Korea, albeit a very sanitised version of reality. 

Photographer Eric Lafforgue experienced life in the beautiful North Korean fishing village of Jung Pyong Ri, which is opening the doors for tourists to witness rural life

He stayed in a well-kept homestay, home of the Chief of the village. There are only 23 families in the area, which is so remote it is not located on a map

The decor inside included an assortment of plush toys, plants, coloured mats and photographs of the country's leaders 

The village is open for homestays and is a far cry from the poverty surrounding it, with its air conditioned facilities and houses equipped with three televisions. 

Described by Lafforgue as an Airbnb-style local property that tourists can visit, he also admits the conditions of a stay can be somewhat restrictive.

Lafforgue explains that the fleeting view from the bus windows is very different to what he finds at the homestay.

He explains: 'The roads on the east coast are very muddy and filled with potholes that workers have tried their best to fix. 

'I see an electric fence lining the beach as an attempt to stall possible Japanese invasion.

'The poverty in these rural villages is palpable. From the comfy seat in my bus, I see old, dilapidated houses with roofs ready to collapse. 

'Only huge murals of the smiling Kim Il Sung bring color to these bleak landscapes. My guide informs me that most tourists do not journey this far into the countryside, and that I may be the first European to ever visit this area.'

However, the journey to the village and views from the house windows reveal traces of the surrounding hardship experienced by locals.

'It's a good opportunity to show tourists a flattering image of rural life, the fragile pillar of the country's economy,' Lafforgue said.

'The beautiful portrayal of rural life provides the North Korean government a flattering image to capitilise on.'

The photographer travelled to the Myongchon county, situated in the North Hamgyong province, wary of what he would discover. 

'Only 23 families resided here. Immediately, I fear I'm in a North Korean tourist trap, complete with actors portraying reality.'

Lafforgue stayed with the village Chief, in a well-kept house, which, although it came complete with ensuite bathrooms, had a bed consisting of a futon on the floor. Each house in the village is identical.

Lafforgue describes the decor as 'kitschy', with huge plush toys, plastic flowers, large plant pots being watched by the propaganda portraits lining the walls.

And the village is still reeling from a visit 11 years ago by Kim Jong Il, when the community was first unveiled as a model village.

The house the General entered was a two-storey building with the best view of the local sandy beach, and his visit is immortalised by a plaque above the door documenting the occasion.

His visit still brings sobs to the homeowner, and she emotionally relayed the encounter to Lafforgue, explaining: 'I did not know General Kim Jong Il would come. It was a great surprise for me.

'The neighbors were so jealous. As we took a picture together, which I will forever treasure, he told me the house was nice. This made me so happy,' she said.

The sign at the top says: 'Kim Jong Il visited this house on December 12, 2004.' The village proudly remembers the occasion and said it inspired them to work harder for their leader's country

The junior suite Lafforgue stayed in has a private bathroom complete with a toilet, which is quite a luxury in the area. The water is heated by placing an antique electrical warmer in it

Lafforgue was treated to a sumptuous meal of duck for dinner, although he learned that the village members sometimes go hungry during the winter months. 

Americans are banned from visiting, but the French photographer asked if any Americans arriving would be welcomed to the homestay.

The smart response was: 'Americans are our enemies, but I would welcome them in the name of legendary North Korean hospitality.' 

Despite the built-up houses, when asked about cell phones, his question was met with confusion, and electricity only runs until 9pm daily.

The village members require a permit to travel within their country, and they are kept as treasured possessions when granted. 

Foreign tourists are hosted in the village, where locals can be seen collecting wood, flowers, and food. Lafforgue has been banend from North Korea for his photographs revealing the reality of life in the secretive country 

Stunning location: The beautiful fishing village where tourists can experience rural life. 'It's a good opportunity to show tourists a flattering image of rural life, the fragile pillar of the country's economy,' Lafforgue said

As a present to the local boys Lafforgue offered them a French football magazine. Inside, they find photos of their national team and beam with excitement

The Chief proudly showed Lafforgue a photograph of his son, encased in a Mickey Mouse frame. 

He is serving his army conscription, which is mandatory for between three and five years for males, and selective for females. 

Other children in the village similarly aspire to be soldiers, with one mother stating to Lafforgue her sons were destined for the army. 

'Our main goal is to defend our country, and for that, we need soldiers, not only musicians or doctors.' 

Lafforgue gathered that the area had received government funding and support to become as developed as it is today.

Despite being impressed by the homestay, and the stunning beaches and landscapes in the fishing village, Lafforgue could not help but notice the poverty of the surroundings creeping in when they thought he wasn't looking. 

'The guides wanted to hide from me the reality of this life, but from my bedroom window, I can see emaciated oxes with carts full of wood and women carrying heavy loads. I also see some girls picking flowers for a bouquet, and others picking grass in Red Cross bags to eat for lunch.' 

The photographer has been banned for his work depicting the realities of life in North Korea, and had to smuggle photographs out of the country on memory cards, after his camera was confiscated. 

Lafforgue spoke candidly to the Chief of the village, who explained what life was like in the rural outpost, which was completely cut off from the retsof the ocuntry until the 1990s.

'Life is very hard in the winter and sometimes the food supply is low,' the Chief told Lafforgue.

Eighty per cent of the tourists here are from China. The Chinese, especially those from Beijing, are amazed by the cleanliness of the air. 

'They wonder how laborers like us can afford such luxurious houses! he continues. 'I tell them that it is because the North Korean regime is more successful than the American government!' The Chief laughs.

The Chief also recounts the best day of his life. 'It was when the Great Leader Kim Il Sung visited the village. We all wept. 

'He was already quite old at this time, and it was such a great honor to meet him. Coming from a poor family, it motivated me to work harder for my leader’s country.'

The Chief's son, serving in the army as a sergeant until the reunification of North and South Korea. When asked when he had last spoken to his son, he was told it was a long time ago

The visit of Kim Jong Il in 2004 still brings sobs to the woman of the house who hosted him. 'As we took a picture together, which I will forever treasure, he told me the house was nice. This made me so happy,' she said

Soldiers walk along the sandy beaches of the fishing village which is in Myongchon county, situated in the North Hamgyong province

North Korean agriculture works under quite difficult conditions, most of North Korea's territory is occupied by mountains and is thus not arable, the little land that is left faces many problems. Floods have washed away rice and corn fields in previous years, destroying a good part of the crops

As is tradition in North Korea, the night ended with music. Two twins perform, but their guitars strings are so old that they cannot be tuned.They have never heard Western music, according to Laffague

A North Korean woman collects picks grass in a Red Cross bags to eat for lunch. The Chief stated that life is very hard in the winter and sometimes the food supply is low

The guide informed Lafforgue that most tourists do not journey this far into the countryside, and that he may be the first European to ever visit this area

Lafforgue was able to communicate with the locals thanks to the help of a guide who provided a fluid translation for conversations

'There is a disparaging difference between the attitudes of the children in metropolitan areas and those of the children in the rural areas. Many wave hello and gaze at me with astonished faces,' Lafforgue said

Children are playing on the beach in the Chilbo region, which is on the North East border with China. They are part of the national karate team and enjoy holidaying at the beach. A sign reading 'stop' is shown

Of the tourists who visited the village, 80% are from China, and they are amazed by the cleanliness of the air. 'They wonder how labourers like us can afford such luxurious houses!' the Chief said. 'I tell them that it is because the North Korean regime is more successful than the American government!'

Lafforgue reported on the the tourists’ impact on the food supply during the winter, as the boats cannot go out to sea as often

Women pull sacks through the village. One woman stated it remained a mystery as to why foreigners would want to visit her village. She admited the community enjoys a better standard of living than the average North Korean village thanks to the tourists
