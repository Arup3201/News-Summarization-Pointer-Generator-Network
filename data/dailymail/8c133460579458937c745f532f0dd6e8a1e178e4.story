Police have seized more than 100 kilograms of methamphetamines, with an estimated street value of $65 million, which were hidden in a kids toy container.

The massive haul was a joint operation between the Australian Federal Police and Australian Customs and Border Protection Service and the drugs were found in a huge container from China. 

During the examination of the container, officers located a false floor which concealed a hidden compartment.

The compartment contained 100 kilograms of a white crystallised substance, which when tested indicated a positive reaction to methamphetamine. 

On Wednesday, customs officers and Australian Federal Police accompanied the crate on a delivery to Prestons in southwestern Sydney, where they arrested a 30-year-old Hong Kong man and 37-year-old Malaysian man in a carpark. 

The men have been charged with serious drug offences for their involvement in the importation.

AFP Acting Manager Serious and Organised Crime Arthur Moerman said the operation is an example of Australian law enforcement agencies cooperating effectively to target illicit drug importations.

'Those that seek to import dangerous drugs such as methamphetamine will continue to face the combined efforts of Australian law enforcement partners,' Acting Commander Moerman said.

ACBPS Regional Commander NSW, Tim Fitzgerald, emphasised the importance of the seizure for community safety.

'Australia's law enforcement agencies are working together to protect the Australian community from harmful substances. The seizure and resulting arrests prevented the production and distribution of a significant quantity of methamphetamines,' Mr Fitzgerald said.

'This was a complex concealment clearly designed to evade law enforcement detection, however our expert x-ray image analysis and enforcement officers have once again proven that crime doesn't pay.'

Investigations are ongoing and the AFP has not ruled out further arrests.
