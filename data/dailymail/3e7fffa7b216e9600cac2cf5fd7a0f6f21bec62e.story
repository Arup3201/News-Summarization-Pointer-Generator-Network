If you are suffering with post-Christmas blues, then this video is sure to put the festive joy back in your heart and a smile on your face.

In what must be one of the most heart-warming video compilations ever, this montage of home videos shows the intimate and magical moment when people receive the gift of a puppy for Christmas.

While the old adage of ‘a puppy is for life, not just for Christmas’ is true, for those who want a pet, there is surely no time better than Christmas to make pup’s entrance into the family one that will be remembered for ever.

Peekaboo! The YouTube video shows the sweet and joy filled moments families welcome a new furry member

Magical moment: Two siblings in matching pajamas lift the lid on a box containing a puppy on Christmas morning

Unrestrained joy: A young girl has a huge smile as she hugs her new puppy close

Speechless: The shock and surprise of some children when they receive the puppy is heart-warming

In the YouTube video, the joy is palpable as pyjama-clad children rip off wrapping paper and box lids to discover a little furry bundle of joy.

The video was compiled in 2010 and has gone viral once again this Christmas, already notching up over 800,000 views on YouTube.

In one family, the mother asks her son and daughter: ‘What did you want for Christmas more than anything in the whole world?’.

When they respond with ‘a puppy’ she teasingly asks ‘and, did you get it?’

Their despondent ‘no’ is enough to melt the stoniest of hearts, as is their unrestrained joy when their father enters with a large box.

‘Santa dropped this off too,’ says the children's mother as the children rip the lid off to reveal a sandy coloured Labrador puppy in a moment that cannot fail to make the viewers smile.

Not just for Christmas: The RSPCA urges anyone thinking of purchasing a pet as a Christmas present to consider the long-term commitment required to properly care for an animal

And it’s not just the youngsters feeling the canine love.

In one particularly touching scene a grandma is handed a large box while sitting on her sofa, surrounded by her family.

When she opens it to discover a puppy she cries out in delight before pulling the pup into her arms and hugging him to her with a beaming smile on her face, while her family, clearly delighted with her joyous response, can be heard laughing in the background.

A gift of joy: With the combination of irresistibly cute puppies and joy filled children, few videos online can rival this one for pure feel-good factor

Other scenes see puppies generally being adorable in and around the wrapping paper they have emerged from.

The RSPCA urges anyone thinking of purchasing a pet as a Christmas present to consider the long-term commitment required to properly care for an animal.

People considering giving a pet for a present should take into account whether the recipient has the time and money to care for the animal 365 days of the year for the next 10-20 years.

Factors to consider include daily grooming, feeding and exercise and ongoing costs such as vets bills and registration fees.
