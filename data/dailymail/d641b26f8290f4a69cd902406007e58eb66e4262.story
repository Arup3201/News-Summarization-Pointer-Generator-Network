Orlando City and New York Red Bulls are considering a move for Ashley Cole in January.

The 33-year-old has failed to convince coaching staff at Roma and he was substituted at half-time during their embarrassing 7-1 defeat to Bayern Munich in midweek.

Orlando will join the MLS next season and are coached by former Everton and Manchester City striker Adrian Heath, who was in the stands at Nottingham Forest's game with Blackburn on Saturday.

Cole drew criticism earlier this year from MLS pundits when he allegedly said that he wasn't ready to retire on a beach in the US but he may be forced to reconsider with his options limited.

His close friend Frank Lampard is due to return to New York from Manchester City in February but could yet spend the rest of the season at Eastlands depending on Yaya Toure's fitness and his Africa Cup of Nations campaign.Â
