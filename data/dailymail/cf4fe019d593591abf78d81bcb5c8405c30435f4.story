Newly released CCTV footage shows the four-door sedan that Las Vegas police are searching for in connection to a road rage incident that left a local mother dead. 

Tammy Meyers, 44, had just finished taking her 15-year-old daughter out for a driving lesson when a man shot her outside her home on Thursday. 

Meyers died Saturday after being taken off life support and her killer is still on the run. 

In addition to surveillance footage of the car believed to have been used by the shooter in the incident, police have also released a sketch of the suspect. 

He has been described as a man in his mid-20s,  standing 6-feet tall, weighing about 180 pounds with spiked dirty blond hair and blue or hazel eyes. 

Police say the car he was driving, seen in the footage, is a gray or silver four-door sedan that may have damage to the front and side of the vehicle.

Meyers' bereaved husband has vowed to find the suspect, and the two other accomplices who were in the car along with him.

'My word to them is I hope the cops find them first and it’s not me,' Robert Meyers said. 'I have four kids. I just want to let you suspects know you took a mom away.'

Police believe the shooter followed Tammy Meyers and her youngest daughter home from a school parking lot on Thursday before opening fire.

She died Saturday evening, a family member told ABC News. 

Tragic: Mother-of-four Tammy Meyers, 44, was shot in the head in an apparent road rage attack on Thursday

Speaking late Thursday night, the woman's husband, Robert Meyers, said: 'This was a loving mother of four kids teaching our daughter how to drive.

Suspect: A 6-foot man with blond., spiky hair aged around 25 opened fire on Meyers as her children watched. Her 23-year-old son returned fire on the suspect's car which held 'several people' according to reports. Those people remained at large as of Sunday morning

'After I turn off the machines to my wife today ... we've got to do something to take our city back,' he said. 'Every time you turn around, someone is getting shot.'

However, according to local news station KSNV, Meyers left the life support machines on Thursday night on doctors' advice - who said to keep them active for 48 hours in case she improves.

Mrs Meyers let her daughter take the wheel of the family's green Buick Park Avenue in a nearby school parking lot when a silver four-door sedan that had been following them passed and hit the brakes, Robert Meyers said.

She steered around the car and continued driving home. Meyers said she sent their daughter into the house before the shooting. 

He described the girl as emotionally distraught.

Meyers said their adult son emerged from their house and fired several shots with a handgun at the fleeing car.

Meyers said he thinks at least one 9mm shot by his 23-year-old son hit the fleeing car, and he called for the assailants to surrender to police. 

Las Vegas police were sorting through conflicting reports and descriptions of the car that fled the scene, Officer Miguel Garcia said.

Investigators were looking for the shooter and possible two other men in the vehicle.

Meyers, 49, said he was in Los Angeles on business when the shooting occurred. He said he believed the two cars crashed at some point; the Buick had slight damage to molding on the passenger side.
