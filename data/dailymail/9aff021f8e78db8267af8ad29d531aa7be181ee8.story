Smart internet connected sex toys are at risk from hackers, a security firm has warned.

Experts say the toys can be easily hacked, allowing people to intercept communications and take control of them.

However, the firm behind one of the gadgets said its 'teledildonics' are secure.

Security experts examined a series of adult toys that link to an app, and are available in male (pictured) and female versions.

Several manufacturers now made internet connected adult toys.

Most working by interfacing with a smartphone app. The allows them to be controlled remotely, or to download new software from the internet.

Some even come with special videoconferencing software so couple can see each other. 

They also warned that one of the toys even captured video, which could easily be accessed.

Joe Bursell of Pen Test partners said the firm decided to investigate the market, which has dozens of products already available and in development.

'Apparently 'cyberdildonics' are set to be the next big thing in sex toys, allowing you to share 'sensations' across the internet, and there is no shortage of products from various manufacturers, and even a social media site where you can get some random who you'll probably never meet to 'drive' your sex toy for you,' he explained.

'If an attacker could intercept the devices communications they could portray their victim as a monumentally inept in the stimulation department, which would be hilarious and tragic in equal measure.'

The firm looked at toys from Lovense, which can even use a videconferencing service.

'There was no apparent encryption during the registration process, meaning anyone snooping on the line could get hold of login information,' the firm told Forbes.

'It will clearly be trivial to compromise a user's account and access some quite juicy content, particularly so if the victim is a 'friend' in a shared household using the same wireless access point.'

Lovense first launched on IndieGogo, and hit back at the claims. 

'There are three layers of security. 

'The server side, the way we transfer information from the user's phone to our server and on the client side,' the firm told MailOnline. 

'We take our customer's private data very seriously, which is why we don't store any on our servers.

'Having said that, we could do a better job explaining how to responsibly store any recorded sessions, and we plan to do so in the future. 

'Encrypting the recorded sessions automatically consumes lots of CPU power and RAM, which as he pointed out is not able to be handled by some Android handsets. 

'We hope that when our users utilize the 'record' feature that they are doing so responsibly, just as they would with their naked selfies or videos.

 The firm currently sells the third generation of female sex toys, under the Lovense brand.

'Using the well-known rabbit design and utilizing mobile technology, we were able to create one of the first long distance vibrators that used smartphones to control it,' it said.

However, it has not responded to MailOnline over the security risks highlighted by researchers. 

Elsewhere, an indiegogo campaign is raising funds for a 'smart' vibrator owners can programme themselves.

The firm behind it hopes users will create and share their own code - and can even plug other devices into to to control.

The gadget can be completely customised through a 'hacker port' - and can even control other devices.

 Created by Comingle, the toy is called the Mod - which stands for Multivibrating Open-source Dildo.

'First and foremost, it's a great vibrator, but it is also so much more,' they say.

'The Mod's software platform makes it easy for you to create vibration patterns, connect sensors and controllers, and completely customize how your Mod behaves.'

Users can upload new programs to it straight from a special website  with no programming knowledge required.

However, they hope that many will create their own custom code for the device.

'If you want to dig a little deeper, you can use our software library to create custom patterns controlled by almost anything you can imagine. 

'Advanced hackers will find that everything is fully-documented, giving you full control to build and contribute your own unique experiences from scratch.'

The device is controlled from a button on the body, and also comes with a seperate 'nunchuck' for more advanced control.

The device has its own built in computer controller, which can easily be programmed.

'The joystick can manipulate power and pulsing patterns,' the firm says.

Shaking the nunchuck's accelerometer can modulate the frequency of the vibrations. 

It can also be linked to a webcam, and analyse the image on screen. 

The more movement in the image, the more intense the Mod's response.

The team has even linked it to a heartbeat sensor.

'A heartbeat sensor lets you feel your partner's arousal in the toy. 

'This one is a real favorite — it's super cool to feel the rhythm increase with your partner's excitement.'
