President Barack Obama shared a joke with his eldest daughter as they enjoyed a scenic hike on their annual Christmas holiday to Hawaii.

The president and Malia, aged 16 years, were pictured laughing and smiling together as they trekked with friends to Makapuu Point Lighthouse, Oahu.

For the father-daughter hike, Malia wore a tie-dye t-shirt and black shorts, while President Obama looked casual in blue shorts and a black polo shirt.

The trail is said to offer sweeping views of Oahu's mountainous coast and on a clear day it is possible to see the neighboring islands of Molokai and Lanai.

The walk was skipped by the First Lady, Michelle Obama, and the couple's youngest daughter, Sasha,13.

Malia and the President looked deep in discussion, with the teenager animatedly gesticulating, as they strolled side-by-side on the picturesque walk.

After returning to their vacation home in the later afternoon, a spokesman said the president was made aware of former President George H.W. Bush was admitted to Houston hospital with shortness of breath.

'President Obama and the first lady send their good wishes to the former president and the entire Bush family during this holiday season,' spokesman Eric Schultz said.

The First Family are not expected to returne to Washington D.C. until January 4. 

It is not yet known exactly where the Obamas are staying this year, though it will be somewhere in Kailua on Oahu island, where they have stayed for the past three years. 

The Obamas, including dogs Bo and more recently Sunny, have spent every Christmas since Barack was elected to president visiting his birth place, Honolulu,  located in the beautiful Hawaiian islands.

In addition to hiking excursions the president generally spends his time on the golf course or working out at a local Marine Corps base.

Happy: The father and daughter appeared happy and relaxed during the festive stroll

Last year the Obama family went on two hikes, two beach trips, a snorkeling expedition and visited the Honolulu zoo during their 17-day trip.

Their six previous trips have lasted between two and two and a half weeks and cost taxpayers roughly $4 million, government watchdogs have estimated, even with the Obamas paying for their own accommodations, which cost them $56,000 in 2013.

Howeve, taxpayers picked up the tab for at least seven other homes in the area that Secret Service and White House staff stayed in.
