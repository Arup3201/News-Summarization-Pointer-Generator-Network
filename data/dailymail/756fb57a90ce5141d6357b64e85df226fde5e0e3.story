Eden Hazard needs to brush up on his Football League knowledge after pronouncing League Two Shrewsbury as ‘Strawberry’.

The Chelsea star, who scored in the 2-1 win over QPR at Stamford Bridge on Saturday, was being interviewed after the match and was quickly corrected after naming the Shropshire side after the fruit.

Chelsea beat Shrewsbury 2-1 in midweek in the Capital One Cup to progress to the quarter finals, with Hazard starting on the bench at the New Meadow.

Elsewhere, QPR boss Harry Redknapp felt the decisive penalty award for an Eduardo Vargas foul on Hazard, who converted from the spot 15 minutes from time, was 'harsh' and 'soft'.

'I thought it was a harsh penalty,' Redknapp said.

'I'm not saying it was not a penalty. It was a soft penalty.

'It was shoulder charge. They both hit each other. Two tiny little guys - Vargas is only 5ft 4in, 5ft 5in and so is Hazard.'
