John Travolta's former pilot is allowed to make a case that he has no confidentiality agreement covering his employment with the actor, an appeals court ruled.

Douglas Gotterba, who wants to give a revealing account of his time working for Travolta's airline company Alto, was given approval by a California court on Tuesday to make his case.

Gotterba, who claims to have had more than just a business relationship with the star, has been trying to prove the agreement is invalid, after Travolta's attorney made a cease-and-desist order.

Dispute: John Travolta's former pilot will be allowed to make a legal case to try to prove he is not bound by a confidentiality agreement

Claims: Former pilot Douglas Gotterba, who wants to write a book about his life, alleges that he did not sign a confidentiality agreement

The attorney, Martin Singer, threatened legal action after learning that the former employee had spoken to the National Enquirer.

According to The Hollywood Reporter, Gotterba decided to 'tell the story of his life' including his dealings with Travolta, after being 'unwillingly thrust' into the spotlight by revelations from another former employee of the star.

He spoke to the National Enquirer and also planned to write a book about his experiences with Travolta, who also has a pilot's license.

Warning Gotterba 'you proceed at your peril,' Singer wrote: 'We demand that you immediately cease and desist from your wrongful course of conduct which has subjected you to enormous liability and entitles my client to seek tens of millions of dollars in compensatory and punitive damages,' the Wrap reported.

Gotterba had worked for Travolta's Alto airlines for six years at the start of the 1980s, and when he left the company he had a written termination notice with Alto.

However, the former employee and the 
company are now disputing which termination agreement is valid, with 
Gotterbra claiming that the final one, dated March 17, 1987, did not 
contain a confidentiality clause.

Alto, however, has said that the correct version of the agreement was a longer version signed April 3, 1987, which included clauses preventing Gotterba from discussing his time with the company.

The later agreement allegedly stated: 'You hereby represent that you have not and will not disclose, communicate, use, nor permit the use of, in any fashion, any personal (i.e., those matters not customarily disclosed by Employer other than to insiders, in the case of [Atlo], or close friends in the case of Travolta), confidential or proprietary information about Employer or any principals of Employer that you obtained during your employment with Employer.'

To try to prove his point, Gotterba sued Travolta and Alto to get a
 judicial declaration about which agreement was valid and whether the confidentiality clause was valid.

Lawyers for Travolta have tried to apply for legal motions to stop Gotterba

Alto has twice tried, unsuccessful, to apply for an anti-SLAPP motion to stop Gotterba's complaint.

When the case was heard by the appeals court Tuesday, presiding justice Arthur Gilbert said the case was not based on Singer's 'sabre-rattling [but] the validity of the asserted termination agreements'.

He added: 'Although the prelitigation letters may have triggered Gotterba's complaint and may be evidence in support of the complaint, they are not the basis of the complaint.'

He ruled that to say otherwise 'would lead to the absurd result 
that a person receiving a demand letter threatening legal action for 
breach of contract would be precluded from seeking declaratory relief to
 determine the validity of the contract.'

An attorney for Travolta told The Hollywood Reporter: 'While
 we believe the court should have thrown out Gotterbaâ€™s lawsuit at the 
outset, ultimately, he will not prevail on his claim.

'Gotterba points to an unsigned draft agreement, which he now 
claims is the controlling document in the case, yet he attached as an 
exhibit to his own complaint the final version of the contract that he 
signed barring his claim. We are very confident that in the end we will
 prevail in the action.'
