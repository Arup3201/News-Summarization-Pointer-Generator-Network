'I left him to die'. Five words which continue to haunt one so young, Joel Herat, 21, who says he still cannot come to terms with leaving the Lindt cafe without his mate Tori Johnson.

He broke down during the Nine Network's airing of 60 Minutes, telling Liz Hayes: 'Thinking about, you know, that could I have got him out? Could I have done something?'

'He was a dear friend. Yeah. I left him to die.'

Cafe manager Tori Johnson was shot at point black range by crazed gunman Man Haron Monis. 

Told he too could have been a statistic if he hadn't fled, Joel Herat remains unconvinced: 'It's what people tell me but I just I just wanted everyone just to get out.'

But he is not the only survivor racked with guilt.

Paolo Vassallo, 36, is also consumed by the moments he decided to get out.

'Just wished I stayed there,' he recounted.

'Still kills me. Yes, as bad as it sounds and as ungrateful as it sounds and as ungrateful as it sounds, I almost wish I got killed in there. Yeah.'

Other hostages of the Sydney siege have also shared the agony, guilt and sense of abandonment they experienced.

Jarrod Hoffman regrets not getting more out with him near the end.

'I thought that Tori was right behind me. I saw Joel but I thought I saw Tori. I thought that it was Tori as well. And I just thought we were all going to be okay. And I thought, I thought wrong,' he said.

'I got most out. But just not enough.'

While some believed they risked dying if they stayed at the Lindt Café in Martin Place, others admitted to 60 Minutes that they felt a responsibility to remain, convinced by the gunman's threats that he would shoot one hostage for each one that fled.

Mr Vassallo, a father-of-two who was one of the first to escape the scene at Martin Place on December 15, recalled the moment he offered 19-year-old café co-worker Fiona Ma the opportunity to run out with him.

'I said "look, we're going now. You're coming with me". She's like: "I can't, I can't" and I was like "why, Fiona?". I ran, I didn't turn around,' Mr Vassallo, who was the third hostage to escape, told 60 Minutes.

Joel and Harriette were among those who were able to escape the clutches of Man Monis from inside the Lindt Chocolate Cafe at the height of the Sydney siege

He also spoke of his deep regret at leaving behind co-worker Tori Johnson, who was shot dead by Man Haron Monis just before the siege's end.

'I said sorry to him. I said "sorry that you're dead and I wish I could have helped you",' Mr Vassallo said.

Ms Ma, who was the first hostage to find out about fellow captive Harriette Denny's secret pregnancy – which she called 'a good moment in a bad day' - confirmed that she was simply unable to leave the others behind.

Mr Vassallo, pictured fleeing the cafe, spoke of his deep regret at leaving behind co-worker Tori Johnson. 'I said sorry to him. I said "sorry that you're dead and I wish I could have helped you",' Mr Vassallo said

'I can't leave people behind because I wouldn't be able to live with the guilt,' she recalled telling Mr Vassallo.

She was one of the last to leave the cafe before police made the decision to storm it.

Others, like 30-year-old Ms Denny, revealed the split-second opportunities they had to escape earlier in the day and recalled grasping the moment without a thought.

'I didn't think I was coming out. Knowing that you're about to die is kind of hard, the desperation you feel, the fear. And without even thinking I just ran,' Ms Denny (far left) said

'I didn't think I was coming out. Knowing that you're about to die is kind of hard, the desperation you feel, the fear. And without even thinking I just ran,' Ms Denny said.

As more and more people escaped, the remaining hostages recalled their fear, convinced that the gunman would turn on them in revenge as promised.

'If someone else leaves, someone dies,' café worker Jarrod Morton-Hoffman recalled Monis saying. 

Despite being aware of endless opportunities to escape, Jarrod Morton-Hoffman refused to budge until the very end, just before police stormed the cafe

Selina Win Pe revealed that she faced the brunt of the gunman's rage when he realised hostages had escaped earlier in the siege. 'He pressed me against the storage room side door. And I said "please, brother. Please don't shoot me please, please don't shoot",' the 43-year-old said

Despite being aware of endless opportunities to escape, the 19-year-old refused to budge until the very end.

Louisa Hope, 52, who was at the café with her elderly mother Robin, prepared to pay for the escaped hostages with her life.

Neither woman had the option to escape due to restricted mobility - Louisa suffers from multiple sclerosis and her 72-year-old mother doubted she could run at great speed.  

'I looked up and opened my eyes and they were all gone. [I thought] "Well this is it" but at the same time "I'm ready",' Ms Hope told 60 Minutes.

The Lindt cafe workers among those who were interviewed by 60 Minutes were told of their manager's last moments of the siege

Selina Win Pe revealed that she faced the brunt of the gunman's rage when he realised more of the hostages had escaped.

'Now he's realised another two, and he's heard it, we all heard it. He pressed me against the storage room side door. And I said "please, brother. Please don't shoot me please, please don't shoot",' the 43-year-old said.

And Louisa Hope, who witnessed the death of Tori Johnson was asked by Harriette Denny did he 'see it coming?'

'He did not,' she said.

'Be assured Harriette that Tori did not see. He did not see. And then it was instant, darling. It was instant. It was instant. And I know he was special to all of you, you know. You loved him. And we loved him.'
