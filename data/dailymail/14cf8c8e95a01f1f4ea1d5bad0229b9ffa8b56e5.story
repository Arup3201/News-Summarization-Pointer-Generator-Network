A drug-crazed burglar who bludgeoned a baby to death in his cot for nothing more than a wallet and a pair of sunglasses during a home invasion will spend at least 32 years behind bars.

A Victorian Supreme Judge handed Harley Hicks, 21, a life sentence on Friday after he broke into a Bendigo home in June 2012 and brutally bashed Zayden Veal-Whitting to death, a crime he described as 'totally and utterly evil'.

Hicks, who was 19 at the time, has offered no explanation for why he bashed the 10-month-old more than 30 times with a homemade baton during the marijuana and ice-fuelled robbery.

'It is almost unthinkable that any human being could have carried out such a sickening crime that you have committed,' Supreme Court Justice Stephen Kaye said in sentencing Hicks.

'What you did was totally and utterly evil.'

Justice Kaye said he could not say for sure if Hicks had viciously snuffed out Zayden's cry in a bid to silence the baby during the robbery.

'If that constituted your motive for killing Zayden, then you murdered an innocent child so that you could escape the premises with the valuable items that you had stolen from it,' he said.

'On the other hand, if that was not your motive, then your murder of Zayden was simply an act of unmitigated evil committed by you for the sheer sake of it.'

Zayden suffered a crushed skull, a broken collar bone and a broken rib as a result of the attack.

Justice Kaye said Hicks perpetrated an extraordinarily violent bashing on Zayden involving multiple blows with the baton to the head, face and other parts of his body.

'He was utterly harmless, defenceless and helpless,' he said.

'Any human being with even a shred of decency and humanity could only feel compassion, tenderness and protectiveness towards an infant in those circumstances.

'By contrast, you inflicted a brutal bashing, with a lethal instrument, on that baby.

'You crushed his skull, you savagely beat him with at least 30 blows.

Justice Kaye said Hicks, of North Bendigo, had shown no remorse.

'At no stage of the trial could I detect from you any sign of remorse. Nor was there even the slightest indication by you of any pity or sympathy for the baby, whose life you had taken, or for his family, whose lives you have shattered.

'Rather, you seemed totally oblivious and impervious to such human feelings.'

The judge also described the English language as being 'entirely inadequate' to describe the horror and grief Zayden's mother, Casey Veal, and her family went through.

Hicks used marijuana and ice before the murder, committed amid a spate of burglaries in the Bendigo suburb of Long Gully in June 2012.

In the early hours of June 15, he broke into Ms Veal's house, unplugged the baby monitor and struck Zayden.

When Ms Veal woke the next morning her eldest son Xavier let her know all the doors were open in the house, and they soon discovered they'd been robbed.

It was then she discovered her youngest child beaten almost beyond recognition.

The murder weapon, a homemade baton, was later discovered at Hick's home with his DNA on one end and Zayden's on the other.

After his arrest, Hicks tried to blame the murder on another person and reportedly lied throughout investigations.

Part of Ms Veal's impact statement was read on Friday and Justice Kaye described the agony the mother would face for the rest of her life.

'I am serving a life sentence... all I have is memories and most of them are tainted by this crime,' the statement read.

In an interview with the MailOnline this week, Casey said she wanted her baby boy Zayden to be remembered not as the murdered baby but as a happy boy who was taken too soon.

Casey, 24, now wants her child’s legacy to be a positive one, and she is trying to combat the stigma and the silence of parents who have their children taken from them too soon.

'I want it to be at a point where it’s not weird or taboo anymore, where it’s just normal,’ she said.

The mother also spoke of how the senseless unprovoked attack on her 10-month-old has affected every aspect of her and her family's life, and turned it in to a living nightmare.

Xavier, now nearly five, is Casey’s eldest child and was taken away from his mother by the Department of Human Services (DHS) almost immediately after his little brother’s death.

'I didn’t know what to do, because I’d had at least one child since I was 19 and I’d always had someone to look after and then it was just me again at 22,’ Ms Veal said.

Detail of Hick's tumultuous upbringing including being sexually assaulted, his history of drug use and criminal record were all aired at the sentencing, and the judge said his hopes for rehabilitation were poor at best.

'There's a real need to protect the community from you.'

Hicks was found guilty by a Supreme Court Jury in April.
