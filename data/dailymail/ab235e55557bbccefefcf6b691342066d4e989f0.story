Leicester City manager Nigel Pearson showed signs of cracking up on Tuesday night by criticising not only the 'irritating' pundits on Sky Sports but his own supporters as well.

The Foxes' boss saw his side surrender a lead against Liverpool, a result which leaves them rooted to the foot of the Premier League table. 

And Pearson was clearly irked in the immediate aftermath when addressing the problems at his door.

He told fans not to bother returning to the King Power Stadium if they aren't prepared to show support.

Pearson  positions himself in the stands, where he is surrounded by supporters, instead of on the touchline because the 51-year-old feels it gives him a better tactical point of view.

But the manager was subject to criticism on Tuesday night as Leicester lost 3-1 against Liverpool.

'I replied to one idiot in the stands and if he doesn't like what he sees, then don't bother coming,' Pearson told SkySports.

'Maybe they ought to think about staying at home, we need support their support. We've worked hard tonight and will continue to do so.'

And he then turned on the broadcaster in his press conference, saying: 'I find some of the - I don't know what you call them - presenters are particularly irritating.' 

It was Leicester's second defeat in four days after last year's Championship winners  were beaten 3-2 by Queens Park Rangers at Loftus Road on Saturday.

Pearson's men visit Aston Villa in the Premier League on Sunday, who recorded their first win since September 13 with a 1-0 victory over Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park on Tuesday.
