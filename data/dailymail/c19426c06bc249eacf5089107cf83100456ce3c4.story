All cup runs have to start somewhere.

But if Tottenham go onto win the Europa League this season, this drab stalemate in Serbia will be lucky to make the commemorative DVD.

As goalless draws go, this was pretty awful. But when Mauricio Pochettino arrives back in England in the early hours of the morning, he'll know it could have been so much worse.

But for a 10 minute spell at the start of the game, Partizan Belgrade dominated this encounter without finding the goal their performance probably deserved.

Pochettino made 10 changes from the side that started against Sunderland on Saturday, Hugo Lloris the only survivor from the 2-2 draw.

There were full debuts for summer signings Federico Fazio and Benjamin Stambouli, while Harry Kane was handed another chance to impress ahead of Roberto Soldado whose Spurs career goes from bleak to virtually non-existent.

Speaking on Wednesday night, Pochettino insisted the Europa League remained a priority for Spurs, despite his decision to leave behind a host of senior first-teamers for the trip to Belgrade.

It's safe to say Spurs fans need convincing, however; just 150 making the trip to Serbia for the encounter.

But Kane very nearly gave them something to shout about inside the first minute, hitting the cross bar with a sharp angled shot after Partizan failed to deal with Ben Davies' corner.

It was a promising start for the visitors, who despite 10 changes, looked far from disjointed during the opening exchanges.

After failing to convert Tottenham's most clear-cut chance in the first half Harry Kane became a peripheral figure, rarely getting the ball in front of goal

Slowly but surely though Partizan, who have won all five of their Super Liga games this season, broke into their stride with Miroslav Vulicevic and Petar Grbic, in particular, causing Spurs problems down the Serbians' right side.

Danko Lazovic saw his shot blocked by Fazio in the 15th minute following excellent work from impressive right winger Grbic.

Partizan continued to find Spurs' left side a fruitful outlet as Davies struggled to make the desired impression on Pochettino.

The Argentine manager took the decision to leave regular left-back Danny Rose back in England; you wondered if he regretted that given Davies difficult start last night.

Andros Townsend tried to shift the flow of the game towards, but his trademark runs down the right were too few and far between for Pochettino's liking.

Davies' below-par display continued on 30 minutes when Grbic once more eluded the Welshman's attentions before picking out Sasa Ilic at the back post, only for the Partizan captain to blaze wildly over the bar.

Townsend needlessly earned himself a yellow card in the 34th minute for angrily remonstrating with one of the assistant referees after he was adjudged to have fouled Vladimir Volkov.

At least someone in a Spurs shirt was showing a semblance of passion, though.

Spurs did little to back up their manager's claim the Europa League would not be an after thought this season, centre-backs Fazio and Jan Vertonghen the only two to produce a decent 45 minute display.

The only crumb of comfort for Pochettino came in the fact that they were still on level terms, Lloris making a good save from Danilo Pantic in the final minute of the first half after a rapid Partizan counter attack to ensure that was the case.

It was all too slow from Spurs. No urgency, particularly in the attacking third.

And it didn't get much better for the visitors after half-time as Partizan continued to dominate proceedings.

Davies nightmare continued three minutes after the restart as he received a booking for hauling down his chief tormentor Grbic after the Montenegrin beat him yet again.

Lloris was forced into another save in the 50th minute, comfortably holding Grbic's shot after Lazovic's pass.

The France No. 1 denied Grbic yet again in then 60th minute, diving low down to his left to save the midfielder's curling effort.

Spurs weren't improving, and their manager knew it.

Pochettino threw on Erik Lamela and Soldado, who played alongside Kane in double-pronged attack, in an bid to change the complexion of proceedings.

His move didn't have the desired effect, though, as the home side continued to poor forward in search of a winner.

Sasa Ilic sent a shot from outside the area over the bar before directing a diving header in the with 14 minutes left to play.

Kane's 25 yard free-kick straight at Partizan's wall in the 83rd minute summed up Spurs' night in an attacking sense. Lacklustre.

Hugo Lloris was the busier of the two goalkeepers but in truth he was rarely stretched as Tottenham were held to a goalless draw in Belgrade
