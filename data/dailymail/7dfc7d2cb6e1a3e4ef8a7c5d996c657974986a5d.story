An 11-year-old girl created a dress made out of 25,000 loom bands and sold it on eBay for £155.

Abigail Baker from Desborough, Northamptonshire, spent seven days creating the multi-coloured garment made entirely from £90 worth of the popular rubber bracelets.

However, where Kathryn Burnand and Helen Wright, from Prestatyn, Wales, managed to flog an almost identical dress last week for £170,000 on eBay, Abigail’s dress went under the hammer for just £155.

The dress is made from £90 worth of loom bands but Abigail has made £65 profit after selling it on Ebay

But after the person who won the £170,000 dress pulled out on Monday, Abigail could be first in the world to successfully sell a loom dress on eBay.

Her parents Marie, 33, and dad Nigel, 42, are proud of her for making an adult size ten dress from the colourful bands.

Yesterday Mrs Baker, a trainee teacher, said: ‘I still can’t believe how someone so young can show so much dedication.

‘She has been getting home from school and getting on with it straight away.

‘She really has been non-stop. Whether it is in the car, while watching TV or having dinner, she is looming.

‘I am really proud of her. I can’t put it into words how I feel. She is just a star, she really is.’

The Bakers believe their daughter is the first youngster to make a dress from loom bands.

Mrs Baker said making the dress had taken a lot of hard work.

She said: ‘She is so proud of her work. It has just boosted her confidence really. She was so determined to do it.

‘She has always enjoyed crafts and loom bands bring the creativity out of children.’

Abigail thanked her family for the support.

She said: ‘I am really pleased with how it has turned out and that it didn’t go horribly wrong. 

‘Everyone I have told about the dress have been really impressed and can’t believe I made it.

‘But most importantly, my family have been the greatest throughout because they gave me the £90 to make this dress and have supported me all the way.’

Abigail auctioned off the colourful garment to raise money for a family holiday.

She said she wanted to raise at least £50 cash so she could give her four-year-old brother Liam £10, keep £20 for her to spend in the arcades and £20 for a fish and chips dinner treat while on holiday in Weymouth, Dorset, next month.

She also wanted to raise money for her old Brownie pack, the 3rd Desborough Brownies.

But the dress exceeded her expectations and fetched £155.

The artistic youngster is not sick of loom bands just yet and she now wants to make a bag out of them.

While the craze for loom bands is keeping plenty of children occupied, it's bad news for wildlife

Experts have warned that fish and sea birds could be under threat - from loom bands.

Conservationists from the National Marine Aquarium are worried marine life could die after eating the tiny elastic bands used to make the popular bracelets.

Staff at the aquarium in Plymouth, Devon, asked children to leave the rubber fashion accessories at home when they head to the beach and take care when getting rid of them.

Paul Cox, the National Marine Aquarium director of conservation said: 'Loom bands, like any plastic item, are capable of persisting in the environment for many, many years and there is abundant evidence of small plastic items making their way into the diets of marine animals and seabirds with tragic consequences.

'While we wouldn’t want to single out loom bands as a specific threat, its true that they will become an issue if we let them get into the seas.

'Taking care with storage, use and when absolutely necessary, their disposal should ensure that they can be enjoyed without becoming a threat to wildlife.

'I’d be particularly worried about loom bands being taken to the beach as, not only is the likelihood of them getting into the sea so much higher there but there are also so many better things to do at the beach.'
