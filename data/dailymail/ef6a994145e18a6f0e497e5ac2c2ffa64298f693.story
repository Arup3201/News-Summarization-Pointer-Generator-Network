Most of the country may have awoken to a chilly but pleasant Autumnal morning today, but, in the middle of the Atlantic, a 300-mile wide hurricane is hurtling towards Britain.

Hurricane Gonzalo is tearing through the Atlantic, with forecasters predicting two weeks of rainfall in just 24 hours when it strikes Britain tomorrow night.

The storm, which left a trail of devastation in its wake in Bermuda, will bring 60mph winds and cause 'significant disruption' when it reaches the UK, the Met Office has predicted.

Temperatures hit 22C yesterday but the good weather will soon be replaced by fierce winds and driving rains as the tail end of Gonzalo lashes the nation.

Bermuda was hit by 134mph winds, leaving most of the Caribbean country without power and tearing roofs off of buildings.

The Midlands and the North will be the worst affected, with the possibility of 23ft waves in the North-West causing flash flooding, The Sun reported.

Met Office forecaster Simon Partridge said: 'There is the possibility for significant disruption. Difficult driving conditions are expected thanks to large amounts of spray and potential for wind-blown debris.

'The strongest winds will fall in Tuesday morning rush hour. Trees risk being blown over, with a greater risk of branches coming down. Ferry sailings could be affected.'

The Met Office has issued a yellow 'be aware' warning for Northern Ireland, western and eastern Scotland, north Wales, the Midlands and the north of England ahead of the storm. 

RAC spokesman Simon Williams warned drivers to be aware of branches and debris left on the road by the powerful storm, which could bring gale force 10 winds.

'Motorists should be prepared and take extreme care, particularly with debris expected on roads which could cause accidents,' he said.

An Environment Agency spokesman said: 'We're monitoring Gonzalo closely with the Met Office and may issue an alert for potential coastal flooding for part of the country.' 

It has already issued a flood alert for parts of East Anglia on Tuesday. 

Fast ferries between Holyhead, north-west Wales, and Ireland were cancelled because of high winds and big seas.

Meanwhile Trafalgar Day celebrations in Llandudno were blasted by gusts of wind which blew wreathes from the war memorial and forced veterans to cling onto their berets. 

Bookies Coral today slashed odds from 33-1 to 20-1 on the UK facing its strongest ever winds when Gonzalo hits. The record is 173mph in the Highlands in 1986. 

Almost the entire island of Bermuda lost power after the hurricane hit, blowing roof tiles off houses and uprooting trees.

Boats were dragged away from their moorings and some capsized as the storm planted a direct hit on the British territory.

Nobody in Bermuda has been killed or seriously injured by the extreme weather. Residents were urged to stay indoors while the hurricane struck.

Gonzalo approached Bermuda as a Category 3 storm then weakened to Category 2 strength just before coming ashore with sustained winds of 110 mph.

Even after beginning to move away, its fierce winds continued to hit the island for hours.

Mr Partridge added: ‘The main reason for the warning is the timing, as strong winds will be coming through the Tuesday morning rush hour – it will be wet and windy and there will be spray on the roads.

‘Also the trees are still quite full of leaves at the moment and with those strong winds we could see a lot more leaves on the roads.'

The clean-up in Bermuda has begun after 130mph winds broke boats free of their moorings and washed them ashore
