With a rueful smile and a brief admission of a truth almost universally accepted, Roy Hodgson seemed to sum up the lot of an England manager forever burdened by expectations, rarely given the kind of freedom that having nothing left to lose bestows upon less exalted colleagues.

‘If I say what I really think, people will turn it against me with a plethora of facts,’ said Hodgson, an experienced and well-travelled coach currently in charge of a team with five straight wins and one foot already in the Euro 2016 Finals.

Despite this run of all-conquering form, the shadow of the summer’s World Cup lingers over England still, it seems. For a man whose earliest memory of the world’s oldest international fixture is of Jim Baxter destroying the reigning world champions in 1967, tonight’s match offers intensity, yes — but also a little breathing space.

Continuing to lay down the testimony that he thought might be used against him, Hodgson said: ‘The World Cup was a real cold shower for us, a real bad moment.

‘I thought we were doing quite a lot of things well, leading up. Then we lost two matches and we’ve hit a wall — and supposedly we have to start again.

‘Well, I don’t think we’ve started again. We did have a massive barrier to get over after the World Cup, because we created that barrier by losing two matches.

‘We erected the fence. But I don’t think we started at the World Cup and have now got somewhere. We’d always been working towards what we’re getting today.

‘The rider from my side is that a lot of players were beginning to emerge and stake their claim just before the World Cup, who hadn’t necessarily fully succeeded,

‘After the World Cup, it gave us a good opportunity to say: “Look, let’s give these guys their opportunity and see if, with the work we do, we can bring them up to speed in the next two years.” That was a great benefit.

‘I’d like to think some of the players we’ve brought in have shown signs they can justify that confidence I’ve shown in them.’

If Hodgson expects to give some of the emerging talents valuable exposure to a fairly fiery friendly, he made it clear last night that he will still be deploying his big guns at Celtic Park, with no club managers promised deals on early substitutions. Even in a match where half-a-dozen changes can be made from the bench.

For the man whose career has taken him all over Scandinavia, to Inter Milan twice — and even included being linked with the Scotland job back in 2002 — this fixture will always be special.

Recalling his first memories of the clash, he revealed: ‘The one memory that sticks out is when Baxter ran us ragged at Wembley just after the World Cup. I didn’t go to the match, you couldn’t get tickets for Wembley in those days, but I watched it on television.

‘I was just starting out in football, just getting interested in tactics, so I watched it with great interest.

‘Scotland came down in ’67 and gave that wonderful display, which was personified by Jimmy Baxter in the middle of the park. That is my abiding memory. But there is no point in me talking about it with these boys, because they weren’t even born.’

Asked whether taking the Scotland job had ever been on his horizon, Hodgson said: ‘It might have been if they’d have offered it to me. In 2002, where was I...?

‘I’ve tried in the past to play down those so called linkages, unless a situation has arisen when I’ve been sitting down being interviewed or offered the job.

‘I’m sure you have the information, and it was correct, but I can’t remember too much about it.’

Polite and politically astute enough not to tread on any local sensibilities, Hodgson — a well-read man who referenced George Orwell’s Animal Farm at one point, albeit in a slightly odd aside — stressed the pure footballing nature of the rivalry that underpins this fixture, while predicting a ‘classic’ game between two teams keen to play the right way.

‘In future, we will play matches against teams who accept we have the better players, so they seek to restrict their attacking movements to frustrate us,’ he said.

‘I’m expecting to see a classic game of football where both teams want to win, where both believe they have the ability and quality to win. Both teams will be attempting to create goal chances, which will inevitably lead to some counter-attacking football.

‘It will be of a similar ilk to Friday’s game between Scotland and Ireland. It will be different to our games against San Marino and Estonia, when defeat wasn’t our major concern but scoring goals might have been.’
