Hilary Devey has claimed the £1,250 a day she was paid for appearing on Dragons' Den was a 'pittance'

Dragons' Den star Hilary Devey has claimed the show paid its dragons a 'pittance' of £1,250 a day and the money was not enough to cover her expenses while working on the programme.

Devey was a dragon on the BBC show from 2011-12, but has bemoaned the pay rate of £15,000 for 12 episodes and claimed the only way to make money was through the investment opportunities the show offered.

The 57-year-old, who launched her freight distribution company Pall-Ex in 1996 to fund her son Mevlit’s education, made her first million within three years and is now worth an estimated £100million.

When asked how much she was paid for her work on the programme, she told The Telegraph it was a 'pittance'.

She said: 'I can’t remember precisely but it’s something like £15,000 to do 12 episodes – and each episode means a 14 to 15-hour day.

'It doesn’t even cover your expenses. You make your money out of what you invest in.'

A payment of £1,250-a-day would equate to a rate of £89 an hour if earned across a 14 hour day.

But despite her complaints, the entrepreneur admitted she would consider returning to the show if asked.

She said she hoped to extend her investment portfolio - but added it would depend on who the other dragons were. 

The show's current dragons are Deborah Meaden, Duncan Bannatyne, Kelly Hoppen, Peter Jones and Piers Linney. However, Hoppen, Linney and Bannatyne are all stepping down at the end of this season.

It has now been claimed lingerie tycoon Michelle Mone is set to star in the show as a replacement for one of the three vacant seats.

A show source has said the timing is finally right for her to join the BBC business programme.

The  source told the Sunday People: 'It's never been the right time for Michelle to join Dragons' Den, she's always had too much going on to devote her full attention to the show.

'But now she feels it's the right time to finally say yes to the role. The news is music to BBC bosses ears.

'They are desperate to bring on board a big name like Michelle.'
