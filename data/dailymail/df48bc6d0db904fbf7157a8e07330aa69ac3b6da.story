Hall of fame Quarterback Joe Montana of the San Francisco 49ers has no doubt in his mind that patriots quarterback Tom Brady is responsible for the Deflategate scandal.

'If I ever want a ball a certain way, I don’t do it myself. So, somebody did it for him,' said Montana on Thursday.

'But I don’t know why everybody is making a big deal out of trying to figure out who did it. It’s pretty simple.If it was done, it was done for a reason. There is only one guy that does it. Nobody else cares what the ball feels like,' he added.

Pointing fingers: Hall of fame Quarterback Joe Montana of the San Francisco 49ers has no doubt in his mind that patriots quarterback Tom Brady is responsible for the Deflategate scandal

The New England Patriots are accused of intentionally under-inflating the footballs they used in their AFC championship game win over the Indianapolis Colts, writes The Boston Globe. 

Reports say that 11 of the 12 balls the Patriots used were more than 2 pounds per square inch lighter than required by NFL rules.

Both The Patriots and Tom Brady have adamantly denied the allegations saying they 'didn't touch the footballs.'

Joe Montana said that just because Tom Brady may not have physically touched the footballs for him, someone else could have done it.

'The quarterbacks don’t touch the footballs,' Montana said.

Montana's comments may have hit close to Home for Brady who posted a photo of himself to his Facebook page wearing a 49ers Jersey in 1983 in honor of Montana, his childhood hero.

'I've been preparing for Sunday since 1983! Ha,' said the caption along with the photograph.

Though Montana thinks Tom Brady is responsible for deflating the balls, he didn't have all bad things to say about him.

Montana said that Tom Brady falls in the 'greatest-ever-to-play' category.

Montana also said that the ball inflation rule merely shouldn't exist.

Montana joked that he and fellow Hall-of-Famer Troy Aikman have laughed about how they should have doctored their footballs.

'Troy and I are in the back talking going, "Dang, we weren’t smart enough to think about air pressure,"' Montana said.

'Cause he couldn’t go in the rain he said, I go, ‘And neither could I.’ I said we should have thought about that earlier.'
