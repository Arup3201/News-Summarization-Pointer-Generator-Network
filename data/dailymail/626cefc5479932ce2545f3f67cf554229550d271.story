Almost 200 prisoners, including dozens of violent offenders, have been let out of jail to learn how to drive, ministers have admitted.

A total of 190 offenders were given temporary release for driving lessons or tests in 2013, including robbers, drug dealers and fraudsters.

Labour warned the lessons, designed to rehabilitate offenders, could spark public fears that prisons are ‘taking a big risk with their safety’.

New figures released in Parliament reveal details of the offenders allowed to walk out of prison to be taught how to drive.

They include 89 held on violent offences, 51 for drugs, 29 for robbery, five for theft, three for fraud and two behind bars for burglary.

The government argues that temporary release can help prepare inmates for the outside world when they come to the end of their sentence.

Most prisoners must pay for their own lessons and the cost of applying for a driving licence.

But ministers admitted that in some cases the costs could be picked up by the taxpayer. The figures were released in response to a parliamentary question by Labour MP Stephen Doughty.

Labour’s shadow justice secretary Sadiq Khan said: ‘The public will be concerned that releasing prisoners to do driving tests is taking a big risk with their safety. Some of the prisoners let out are inside for serious and violent crimes.

‘It’s absolutely crucial that ministers look into this to ensure everything possible is being done to make sure that no risk is being taken with the public’s safety.’

A new report this warned fights and assaults are a daily occurrence in the nation's prisons with unprecedented levels of violence.

The chief inspector of prisons Nick Hardwick suggested that the rise in problems in jails could be linked to government reforms and spending cuts, a claim disputed by the government.  

Mr Khan added: ‘There is enormous pressure in the prisons service caused by the government’s policies so we need guarantees that corners aren't being cut with this.

‘We cannot have the wrong kinds of prisoners might be let out, which would be a disaster. We need urgent reassurances that isn’t happening.’

The coalition government has repeatedly claimed to be making life in prisons tougher, removing perks for inmates.

But the number of prisoners being given release for driving lessons has fallen by just 25 since 2008.

Prisons minister Andrew Selous said: ‘Temporary release can be an important tool in helping prisoners to re-adjust safely and productively to life in the community.

‘It is allowed to prisoners only towards the end of their time in custody and only after a thorough risk assessment.’

He stressed that changes are being made to temporary release to ‘give even greater weight to public protection and the need for prisoners to demonstrate how the release will aid their rehabilitation and increase their chances of leading a crime free life on release’.

Driving lessons are only allowed if the licence is required to help their rehabilitation, such as improving their chances of getting a job.
