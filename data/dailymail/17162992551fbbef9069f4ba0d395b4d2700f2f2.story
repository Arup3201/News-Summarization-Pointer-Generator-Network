Despite rising skin cancer rates, the number of American teens using sunscreen has dropped by almost 12per cent - from 67per cent to 56per cent - in the space of a decade, according to a new report.

In addition, the number of teens - predominantly white females - using indoor tanning beds only fell slightly (eight per cent) in that time-frame; suggesting that awareness campaigns which warn of the links between cancer and UV exposure are falling on deaf ears.

The report, conducted by the William Paterson University in Wayne, New Jersey, looked at data between 2001 and 2011, and was published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

New report: The number of American teens using sunscreen dropped by almost 12per cent between 2001 and 2011, and nearly 30per cent of teens admit they use tanning beds, most of them white females

The study's lead author, professor Corey Basch told CBS: 'Since UV exposure is such a major component in causing skin cancer, using sun protective behaviors like applying sunblock and avoiding intentional exposure to tanning devices will be key.

'Future prevention efforts definitely need to be focused at young people.'

Skin cancer is America's most common type of cancer. According to the Department of Health and Human Services, five million people are treated for it each year, with cases of melanomas - the deadliest form - increasing by 1.6per cent in men and 1.4per cent in women between 2001 and 2010.

Tanning beds in particular have been linked to higher incidences of melanomas, and despite ever-increasing warnings and regulations, 29.3per cent of U.S. teens admitted to using them in 2011; only a slight improvement on the 37.4per cent who did so in 2009.

'It's still in vogue to have that suntanned color,' said dermatologist Dr Jeanine Daly of the North Shore-LIJ Health System in Manhasset, New York.

Melanoma is the most dangerous type of skin cancer, and the leading cause of death from skin disease.The exact cause isn't clear, but exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from sunlight or tanning beds increases your risk of developing melanoma.It may begin in a mole (skin melanoma), but can also begin in other pigmented tissues, such as in the eye or in the intestines.

'No matter how hard we've been trying to get that message out, we need to keep at it and work harder.'

Ms Daly advises teens - and adults alike - to use zinc-containing sunscreen that protects against both UVA and UVB rays; both of which are known to cause cancer.

She added: 'The most important thing to remember about sunscreen is that it doesn't last very long. Sunscreen needs to be applied every two hours.'

This report follows hot on the heels of another, publicized by the U.S. surgeon general, Rear Adm. Boris Lushniak last month.

He cited an alarming 200per cent jump in deadly melanoma cases since 1973, and said state and local officials need to do more to help people cover up.

Schools, he suggested, should encourage kids and teens to wear hats and sunscreen, and schedule outdoor activities when the sun is low in the sky. Additionally, rules surrounding tanning beds should be tightened.

'We need more states and institutions on board with these policies that discourage or restrict indoor tanning by our youth,' Mr Lushniak said.

'Tanned skin is damaged skin.'
