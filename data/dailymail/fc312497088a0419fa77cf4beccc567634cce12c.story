A woman in her 50s will give birth to her own children after becoming a surrogate mother for her infertile daughter.

Cathy Donnelly, 58, is six months pregnant and will welcome her seventh grandchild into the world when she gives birth to her - before daughter Shannon Fischer raises the baby.

Mrs Fischer and her husband Jamie had been trying for two years when they discovered they couldn’t conceive due to scarring in her uterus.

So Mrs Donnelly mother of three and a grandmother of six, volunteered to be a surrogate mother for her daughter.

Mrs Fischer said: 'The day I came home from my surgery mum said "I'll do it". She didn't hesitate.'

Mrs Donnelly, from London in Ontario, Canada, said: 'I felt bad for them - I just thought what’s nine months of my life? They are going to have a child for the rest of theirs? It's not like I'm busy doing anything.'

Michael Murray, specialist at the 
Northern California Fertility Medical Center, says though there have 
been cases of mothers acting as surrogate for their daughters before it 
is typically something the medical community does not advise.

He said: 'Usually it’s a close friend
 or a sister that acts as the gestational carrier - women who are over 
45-years-old are not normally in good enough health.

'Pregnancy for older women is much 
riskier. The most common complications are high blood pressure, 
gestational diabetes and premature child birth.'

But they were risks Mrs Donnelly was willing
 to accept and while she admits her pregnancy hasn’t been easy, she has
 had no complications so far.

'It was long process and involved a heavy dose of fertility drugs for both of us but in the end it all paid off.

'I was standing in line for a coffee when I got a call from my doctor confirming I was pregnant. I was just bawling - people must have thought someone close to me died.

'But it has been challenging. Now I’m showing I make sure people aren’t staring or looking at me because they’re probably thinking ‘look at that old lady.'

Mrs Donnelly  said she did question whether she was doing the right thing and if everything would work out okay until she started to feel the baby move. Now her only concerns are about how she will feel once she has given birth.

'I don't know if I'll feel like I've lost her, I don't know how I'm going to feel,' Mrs Donnelly said.

Shannon plans to name her daughter Zoey Hope Catherine after her mother. And for her the whole experience has made her cherish their mother-daughter relationship even more.

She said: 'It just changes your relationship 360 degrees. We were close before but it’s just on a whole new level. I want to be like she is to my own daughter, that caring and willing to do stuff for her.'
