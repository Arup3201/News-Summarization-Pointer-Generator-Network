His step-mother Fiona Hodge started the hashtag #GiveBenAJob to help him find permanent employment. 

Her original appeal has received more than 700 retweets since she posted the message on Twitter on Friday night - a post that was retweeted by comedian Jason Manford  - and Ben has now been offered two jobs, although one is in California. 

Ben's father Mike said: 'It's been a really busy day because we've had so many people wanting to know more about Ben and him looking for a job.

'One city hotel said on Facebook that they'd like to see his CV and talk to him.

'We've even had an offer from someone in California but unfortunately it's a bit too far for Ben to travel!

'People have been really kind and offering us help in getting Ben the job he wants to do.'

Ms Hodge, 46, said her step son, who lives in Kensington, Liverpool, with his mother Doreen, receives disability living allowance benefits due to his condition.

Ms Hodge said: 'I've been thinking about doing something to help Ben for a long time but I wasn't sure what would be the best way to help.

'I've seen a lot of people launching appeals on social media sites so I thought I'd give it a go.

'I posted the message online and within hours it had been retweeted hundreds of times - even Jason Manford got involved.

'Ben is an incredibly lively and friendly character - he deserves the chance to show people what he can do.

'He's worked for big chains like McDonald's and Wetherspoons in the past but it has never been a full-time paid role.

'He has a level two NVQ in catering and would love to be a baker - but in fairness he'd do any job.

'I really hope someone can help him find something - it would mean the world to him.'  

Mr Small, a mental health charity manager, said: 'Ben aspires to do what all other adults his age do.

'He's shown in the past that he is capable of working but he hasn't had that opportunity to show it on a full-time basis where he can earn a living from it.

'The social media campaign is proving to be fantastic - I never in a million years thought it would get the coverage it has so far.

'Hopefully it will lead to Ben getting work and proving his worth to everyone.'
