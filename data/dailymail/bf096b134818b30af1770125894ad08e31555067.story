A beautiful snowy owl has been captured scouring a snow-covered field  in the hunt for food.

Her piercing yellow eyes were the only thing that stood out against the white landscape in Ottawa, Canada.

Once locked on to a vole she swooped just inches above the surface waiting for the perfect moment to pounce.

The stunning set of images was captured by photographer Rick Dobson.

A beautiful snowy owl was captured gliding inches above a snow-covered field in Ottawa, Canada, in the hunt for food, with her bright yellow eyes just visible above the wing

The 57-year-old said: 'She had in fact spotted her prey and was coming in silently for the kill.

'Snowy owls are diurnal so they hunt and are active both during the day and night.

'When they are resting they often sit in a snow-covered field motionless, making themselves very hard to spot.

'When they are hunting they will perch on a lump in a field, a fence post, or a hydro-pole where they have a lookout from which to spot their prey.'

As the owl came over the top of a ledge she pulled her wings back so she could soar across the field

The owl flew silently just millimetres above the snow-covered floor, keeping her bright eyes on the prey

To get close enough to the owls, Mr Dobson had to make sure he approached slowly and did not walk directly towards the birds.

He said: 'Every winter I go out with my binoculars and scan the farmers' fields to see if I can locate wintering snowy owls.

'When I locate an owl I have to spend time slowly approaching it to get within a good distance to take photographs.

When the owl got close enough she used her sharp talons to catch her prey. Snowy owls will usually fly a short distance before landing to eat

Snowy owls often approach their prey from a low angle to ensure a shadow does not give the game away

'Some owls are much more approachable than others.

'Upon repeated visits the owls come to realise that I am not a threat and will ignore me, providing I move slowly, and carry on with its business.'

Mr Dobson described the owls as 'one of the most magnificent creatures on earth'.

'I think of them as snow ghosts or snow angels,' he said.

'They are very large birds but fly silently and gracefully and can endure the harshest of habitats.

Happy with its work: Mr Dobson added: 'Snowy owls are one of the most magnificent creatures on earth'. The beautiful bird is pictured after the hunt

'They are powerful and regal and, to me, symbolise the Arctic.' 

Snowy owls fly silently when they hunt and often approach their prey from a low angle.

They use their sharp talons to catch animals and will usually fly a short distance before landing to eat.

Snowy owls tend to swallow their food whole and will return to hunt after eating.
