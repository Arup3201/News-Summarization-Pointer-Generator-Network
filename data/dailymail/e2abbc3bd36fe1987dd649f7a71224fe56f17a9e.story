President Obama has reiterated that he stands by the decision to exchange five Taliban prisoners for the release of Bowe Bergdahl and 'would do it again' as sources have revealed that the American soldier was physically abused while in captivity.

The latest insight into the five years Bergdahl was held as a prisoner by the Taliban comes from an official who spoke on the condition of anonymity as the 28-year-old is treated in an American military hospital in Germany.

The unidentified official told CNN that Bergdahl tried to escape from his captors but was caught and forced into a cage or box as punishment.

Making a break for it: Bowe Bergdahl was physically abused during his captivity and tried to escape twice during the five years he was held by the Taliban

The Daily Beast revealed that Bergdahl attempted to escape twice in his five year ordeal, and once in 2011 he was briefly successful because his captors had stopped paying close attention to him.

He reportedly was on his own for three days after fleeing their hold, though he was eventually found in a trench that he had dug with his bare hands.

'He fought like a boxer,' a Taliban source told The Daily Beast, who added that he was eventually overpowered and then dragged back to their compound in shackles.

President Obama has repeatedly defended his administration's decision to strike a deal with the terror group in order to orchestrate Bergdahl's release.

'We have a rule, a principle, that when
 somebody wears our country’s uniform and they’re in a war theater and 
they’re captured, we’re gonna do everything we can to bring ’em home and
 we saw an opportunity and we took it,' he told NBC's
 Brian Williams during an interview that was held at the World War II 
cemetery in Normandy, France on the anniversary of D-Day.

'I make no apologies for it.

Standing by his decision: President Obama said that the Bergdahl exchange came as a result of American principles that dictate that no soldier should be left on the battlefield

'It was a unanimous decision among my principals in my government and a view that was shared by members of the joint chiefs of staff.

'This is something that I would do again and I will continue to do wherever I have an opportunity. If I have a member of our military is in captivity- we're going to try to get 'em out.'

One of the biggest criticisms of the approval process was that a key group of congressional leaders who are typically notified before such significant international deals are struck was kept in the dark about the Bergdahl negotiation.

'The main concern was that we had to act fast in a delicate situation that required no publicity,' Obama said.

'The fact is we are ending the war in Afghanistan. We have released- both under my administration and previous administrations- a large number of former Taliban fighters, some of whom returned to the battlefield. But by definition, you don't do prisoner exchanges with your friends, you do them with your enemies.'
