A 14-year-old schoolgirl has been suspended for wearing a charity badge on her school blazer in memory of her late auntie.

Kayleigh Handshaw has been temporarily excluded from Outwood Academy Portland in Worksop, Nottinghamshire, after she refused to remove the Macmillan flower emblem.

Kayleigh, who wears a Macmillan flower in memory of her auntie, said: 'I’ve worn it for over a year now since we found out what was happening with my auntie’s cancer and my grandad got cancer too.'

Her friend, whose grandfather died of cancer last week, had been wearing a badge in support of Cancer Research UK and has also been suspended.

In a statement Outwood Grange Academy Trust said that the school has a proud record of supporting charities but some pupils were wearing five or six badges at one time. 

The school says it is happy for students to wear multiple charity badges on their bags or outside coats.

Kayleigh’s mother, Deborah Handshaw, said: 'I understand that the school does have rules and regulations. The problem is I’ve never heard of this one. 

'It was like they just woke up and decided that they didn’t want to see them anymore and they had to take them off.'

Kayleigh, 14, has so far missed three days at school and is not sure when she will be able to return.

Ms Handshaw said her daughter was stopped at the gate and told to remove the yellow flower she had worn for a year to show her support

Ms Handshaw said her daughter was stopped at the gate and told to remove the yellow flower she had worn for a year to show her support. 

After she refused to remove the badge, she was excluded for 'refusing a reasonable request'. 

Ms Handshaw said she has since had two meetings with the school but is still unclear when she can return and why she suddenly wasn't allowed to wear the badge she had worn for a year.

Ms Handshaw, of Worksop, said: 'It is just a small, little yellow flower, it has been there for a year and is the only badge she wears on a her black blazer.

'Kayleigh asked the teacher if she could work in seclusion but with the badge on but he wouldn't have it. He wanted her to put it on her bag, that seems to be to only reasonable way.

'Now there is no sign of her going back to school unless she removed the badge.

'The choice has always been hers, I know she would take it off if I asked her but I wouldn't ask her to do that outside school and I wouldn't ask her to do it in school.

'This is simply a 14-year-old girl who has chosen to promote awareness.'

Outwood Academy Portland has defended its decision to suspend pupils for wearing charity badges on their school uniform.

Several pupils were suspended last week for wearing the badges on their blazers.

The school says pupils are free to wear the badges on their bags and outdoor coats, but not on their blazers.

A spokesman said in a statement: 'Outwood Grange Academies Trust has a proud record of supporting charities and encouraging each student to take part in charitable activities. Our trust actively supports the Help for Heroes charity amongst others.

'There are some students who were wearing five or six badges, some that include football, music or fashion, on their lapels and we feel this detracts from the drive to support individual charities.

'We organise a number of charity events throughout the school year which are highly successful in raising the profile and the importance of many charities.

'Students are given the opportunity to show their support for charities at particular times of the year to coincide with national or international appeals which often includes students wearing a particular badge, poppy, bangle or ribbon.

'To highlight the importance of these activities we ask that students refrain from wearing them throughout the year; a poppy, for example would lose its impact if it just became another badge.

'However we are more than happy for students to wear multiple charity badges on their bags or outside coats as this does not form part of the uniform.'

Ms Handshaw said: 'I think that is ridiculous to say that a poppy loses its importance over a year, the person wearing it just chooses to remember all year round.

'It doesn't make it more important if they just remember for a short period of time.

'Kayleigh wants to remember all year round, every day, every minute. She has the opportunity to explain to people this is a Macmillan flower and what it means to her.'Kayleigh added: 'It makes me feel rather upset, I just wore it to remember my aunt.'
