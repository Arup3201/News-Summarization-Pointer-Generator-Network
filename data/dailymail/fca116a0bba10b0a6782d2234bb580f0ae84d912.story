Hundreds of migrants in Calais have clashed as tensions in an illegal camp spilled over into violence leaving seven injured.

Around 200 migrants  fought in the early hours row that was believed to have been sparked by a queue jumper in the line for food.

The fracas between migants from Afghanistan and Eritrea left one with a broken leg and others with superficial wounds, officials said.

Thousands of migrants have flooded through the newly porous borders to undertake the risky crossing to Italy offered by people traffickers. Many drown on the trip.

Once in Europe, most make their way to Calais and camp in the town until they manage to board a lorry undetected and get to Britain. Some have been trying for at least a year.

Tensions have been at breaking point between the desperate men because of tough winter living conditions and slow truck traffic that diminishes their chances of trying to sneak to Britain, said Christian Salome of the Auberge des Migrants association, which distributes meals. 

'We know the least thing can spark differences,' said police union official Gilles Debove.
