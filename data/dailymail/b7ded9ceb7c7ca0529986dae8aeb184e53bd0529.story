A picture of the Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall sharing a joke at Royal Ascot has been chosen as the image for the couple's Christmas card.

Smartly dressed for a day at the races, Charles and Camilla look relaxed as they stand against a balcony rail, in what is thought to be the royal box.

In the photograph taken by Stephen Lock in June, the Duchess is wearing an Anna Valentine pansy print chiffon dress with a peppermint green silk coat and holds a silk clutch bag, also from Anna Valentine.

The Prince, who is pictured holding a racing programme, looks smart in an Anderson and Sheppard morning coat, a shirt by Turnbull and Asser and a top hat by Lock and Co.

Printed on the cover of each Christmas card is the Prince of Wales' feathers and the Duchess' cipher and inside are the words 'Wishing you a very Happy Christmas and New Year' with the photograph opposite surrounded by a thin red border.

The couple attended the races in June this year.

While her husband the Duke of Edinburgh 
stayed at home to rest and recover from an 11-night stay in 
hospital where he had exploratory abdominal surgery, the Queen was 
joined in the horse-drawn procession by Charles and Camilla.

Last year, the couple chose an image from the Queen's Diamond Jubilee celebrations.Â

The card featured a picture of the smiling couple during June's spectacular Thames river pageant organised in honour of the Queen's 60 years on the throne.

Charles and Camilla were on board the Spirit of Chartwell alongside the Queen, Prince Philip, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry.

The Prince of Wales wore his Royal Navy admiral's ceremonial day dress uniform for the event, while the Duchess of Cornwall had braved the rain in an Anna Valentine coat and dress and a hat by Philip Treacy.

The nautical spectacle, which was Prince Charles' suggestion, saw 1,000 vessels sail along the Thames watched by huge crowds lining the banks of the river.

The ceremony kicked off a long bank holiday weekend of celebrations to mark the Queen's Diamond Jubilee.

Politicians have also released this year's Christmas cards with Prime Minister David Cameron and Labour leader Ed Miliband both putting their children centre stage.

Deputy PM Nick Clegg and his wife took a more comedic approach to their cards by allowing their children to draw over a picture of them.
