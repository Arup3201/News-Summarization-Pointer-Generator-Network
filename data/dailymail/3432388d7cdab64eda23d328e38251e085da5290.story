By signing for Roma, Ashley Cole will become only the second British player to play for the Serie A club.

Welsh
 legend John Charles played for Roma between 1962 and 1963, scoring four
 goals in just 10 appearances before ending his career with Cardiff 
City. 

A statement on the Serie A club's official website read: 'AS Roma have acquired Ashley Cole's playing registration on a two-year deal which expires on June 30, 2016.

'The agreement also gives the club the right to extend the contract into a further season.'

QPR winger Shaun Wright-Phillips has also taken to Twitter to send his wishes onto Cole.

Wright-Phillips wrote: 'All the best my bro @TheRealAC3 good luck in Rome'.

Rome-based newspaper Il Romanista ran 
the headline 'Yes we Cole' on their Sunday edition and reported that a 
two-year deal for the experienced left-back was already sewn up.

The former England defender was a free agent after leaving Chelsea and had interest
 from Monaco and various Major League Soccer franchises before choosing to switch to Italy.
