She is the 'Ice Princess' who has stolen the hearts of Russia - and melted the notoriously hard heart of Vladimir Putin to become the biggest star of the Sochi Olympics.

And when 5ft 2in Yulia Lipnitskaya takes to the ice tonight in what is now the most eagerly anticipated contest of this Olympics more Russians are expected to tune-in to watch than for any other sporting event.

For the 15 year-old skating sensation, who became the youngest skating gold medalist in 78 years when anchoring Russia to team gold on the ice, is set to have the biggest impact on an Olympics for Russia since the 'Little Sparrow,' Olga Korbut, came out of the Soviet Union to enchant the world and take gold as a 17 year-old at the Munich Olympics in 1972.

Mr Putin was in the audience last week to see Miss Lipnitskaya, who is so young she only qualified to take part here in Sochi by 23-days, skate brilliantly to clinch Russia's first gold of the Olympics and rewarded her with a rare smile - and a kiss.

That dazzling performance of brilliant skating, technique and composure under pressure has made her the darling of Russia with a back story that has fascinated the rest of the world.

It has been reported that Russian state officials have been ordered to trace her father, Slava, who never returned to his pregnant wife, Daniela, after being conscripted in the Army.

Miss Lipnitskaya, who has never seen her father and carries her mother's surname, was born and raised in Russia's fourth city Yekaterinburg, in the Urals and on the edge of Siberia.

A neighbour in Yekaterinburg, Valentina Popova recalled: 'When Yulia's mother Daniela became pregnant, her father Slava was conscripted into the army and did not return.

'It is said immediately after the army, he moved to another city. Daniela raised her daughter alone. She had to work at several jobs, even on the local market, to make ends meet. I remember Daniela returning home frozen after a day on the market in freezing temperatures. She worked so hard to provide and support Yulia. It was very tough.'

Elena Legkovets, Yulia's former coach in Yekaterinburg, said: 'Her mother brought Yulia to our sport school 'Lokomotiv'. She was just four years old.

'I remember when I saw this girl at her casting. I was struck by her confident look, fearlessness, and thought, "If only I can train her." So I was lucky'.

At the age of 10 years, Yulia and her mother moved to Moscow to continue training.

'Almost from the first day it became clear that she was not like the others. She stood out for her brightness, activity and extraordinary seriousness.

'Off the rink, she could joke, but when she stepped on the ice, there left no trace of laughter. Figure skating she always treated as to a job. I would say too seriously and responsibly.

'I have never seen her cry. She is a fighter. Even when she fell, she felt pain, but she took her courage into both hands, rose and ran on.

'Even my older children when they came to watch the kids training were amazed at Yulia's activity. I always told them, 'You should follow her example.' She was literally on fire with skating. She was always last from the ice rink. When I told her , "Yulia, let's finish up, stop", then each time heard in response: 'No, still one last time.''

Despite this dedication, the move to Moscow nearly didn't take place and Miss Lipnitskaya considered abandoning top skating.

The now champion said: 'My mother asked: do we finish it all or we will try to ride on? I could now say that everything depended on my decision. Although at the moment I would not be upset, in ending the training for ever - even the thought that finishing with this sport would be great - but then I was suddenly struck: 'Stop! And why must I finish?' So I told to my mother: 'Let's go!'

'My mother gave up everything for me. In Yekaterinburg, she had a job and an apartment in the centre of the city, and her whole life. And in Moscow - nothing. We did not even know where we will live. It is now all normal.' The journey was across two time zones, and 1120 miles.

Miss Lipnitskaya, who now lives in an apartment in Moscow, said: 'I remember that for two days we were travelling by car... I mostly looked out the window, how beautiful, how the landscape changed... We were not going for three days, but to change our life. With all our things in one car.'

She added: 'My mother doesn't work now. So I am the only breadwinner in the family. We want to buy our own house very much. When you don't have a house, it's such a headache.'

One of her greatest problems now, coach Etery Tutberidze says, is keeping her weight down: 'She struggles with it... in my work, I never faced such cases - she just cannot eat at all. And I'm very sorry that she had to endure so much, but I cannot help it.'

'It is great that she copes with it. When she needed to lose weight, she could eat only the powder 'Squeeze' - a fibre that gives energy.

'It is hard, and the weight goes down very slowly - from 100 grams per day. But she copes, thank God.

'Last season her weight changed and it caused her injury. Now Yulia holds her weight, self-controlled, although it is very difficult.'

Miss Lipnitskaya admitted: 'I have to refuse everything, the things that I like most, I was forbidden. I do not put on high heels at all now. I understand that I need to protect my legs. I would not say that I get tired of restraining. I think of it that if something is impossible, I do not want this.'

As with many Russian athletes, she does not go to school but is taught at home, lessons fitting in around training.

In the team event, Miss Lipnitskaya performed to the music from Schindler's List, Stephen Speilberg's film of the Holocaust, while symbolically wearing a red coat.

Schindler's List is shot almost entirely in black-and-white but in a couple of scenes a small girl is spotted in the middle distance wearing a red coat - first in the Jewish ghetto, then later on a pile of bodies.

The sight signals a quiet turning point for the hero, Oskar Schindler, played by Liam Neeson, and his mission to save his 'list' of prisoners from the gas chambers.

It is not known what music she will perform to tonight when she faces world and Olympic champion Kim Yuna, of South Korea, dubbed the 'Ice Queen' at the start of a two-day showdown that all of Russia awaits.
