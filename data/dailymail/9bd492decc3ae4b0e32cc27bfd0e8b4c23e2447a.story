The House of Representatives passed legislation on Thursday amending Obamacare to increase the number of hours workers must be on the clock for each week in order to qualify for health coverage through their employers.

President Barack Obama has already warned that he won't sign the bill and not enough Members of Congress voted in favor of the proposed law to override the country's chief executive.

The measure faces a rocky road in the Senate, as well, where Republicans also hold a slim, but not veto-proof, majority. At least 10 Democratic senators have already voiced strong opposition to the legislation.

The bill succeeded in the House on a vote of 252-172, with a dozen Democrats crossing party lines to vote for the health care reform legislation.

If turned into law, the measure would redefine full-time employees that are eligible for health care coverage through their work places as those that are on the schedule for 40 hours a week, up from the current 30. 

The intent of the original rule was to broaden the number of Americans who are covered by their employers' health plans. Republicans argue that in effect the Obamacare provision has led businesses to cut back the number of hours it assigns to part-time workers in order to avoid the health care mandate.

'When middle-class Americans can’t work a full, 40-hour work week because of the president’s health care law, they can’t provide for their families, pay their bills, or get ahead in a tight economy,' House Speaker John Boehner said today. 

Earlier this week the White House said it would veto the legislation if it passed because it doesn't want to aid and abet business owners 'who are looking for loopholes' to get out out of taking 'responsibility' for their employee's health insurance.

'And we certainly don't think that we should make that easier. That's not good for the Affordable Care Act,' White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said. 'It's not good for these workers.'

'What's clear is that the temptation that some employers might have would only be sweetened significantly if this Republican change...were to be put into place,' he said.

Boehner fired back today that Obama's veto threat is 'a sad commentary on where his priorities lie.'

'House Republicans will continue putting Americans’ priorities first, and the president ought to reconsider his opposition to this bill and start doing the same,' he said.

If every member of the Republican caucus showed up to vote, the GOP would still need nearly 45 Democratic representatives to vote for the bill in the House to cancel out Obama's objection.

When the lower chamber voted on the legislation last session it was able stir up six more Democratic votes than it did today, but nowhere near enough to challenge the president.

The legislation never made it to the floor of the Democratic-led Senate in the 113th Congress. Now that Republicans run the legislative body, it is expected to pass.

Still, Republicans have just 54 votes in the upper chamber and would need more than a third of the Democratic caucus to flip sides to nullify a veto.

As soon as the House passed its version of the legislation a group of 10 Democratic senators issued statements lambasting the measure.

'This misguided proposal would actually create the problem it’s pretending to solve,' Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy said. 

'By moving the threshold to 40 hours, a worker who already receives health coverage through their job could see their schedule cut by just one hour a week – to 39 hours instead of 40 – and their family’s health care taken away,' he contended. 'That’s not just counterproductive, it’s wrong.' 

Washington Sen. Patty Murray called the proposal 'unacceptable' and argued that it would 'actually encourage companies to game the system by cutting time for the millions of workers who work more than 40 hours. 

The senators argued that the legislation could raise the deficit by $53 billion while hanging millions of workers out to dry.

'After voting more than 50 times to repeal it, it is simply outrageous that Republicans are once again trying to dismantle the Affordable Care Act with a bill that would deny workers access to affordable health coverage through their employer and add billions to the deficit,' California Sen. Barbara Boxer said.

Michigan Sen. Debbie Stabenow accused Republicans of being 'fixated on denying quality, affordable health care to millions of Americans.'

'Instead of wasting more time on a bill that would add tens of billions of dollars to the deficit and put the health insurance of millions of workers at risk, we should be focused on finding ways to make sure even more families gain secure, affordable coverage,' she said.

In addition to the bill making changes to the employer mandate portion of the health care law President Obama said this week he'd toss out two other pieces of legislation if they came across his desk: a bill fast tracking approval of the Keystone XL pipeline and a measure that the White House believes would weaken consumer protections included in the 2010 Dodd-Frank banking bill.

The House has plans to vote on Keystone tomorrow. It already passed the bill affecting Wall Street but the vote failed to satisfy a procedural rule so the House must again vote on it if is to be formally approved.
