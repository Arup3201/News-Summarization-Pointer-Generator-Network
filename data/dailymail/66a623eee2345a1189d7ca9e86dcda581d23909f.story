Daniel Sturridge is expected to miss his side's Champions League encounter against Real Madrid despite travelling to Spain with the rest of his Liverpool team-mates on Monday.

The 25-year-old has been out since since the beginning of September after sustaining a thigh injury while on England duty and then a calf problem before making his club comeback.

Liverpool have missed his goals in that two months - drawing increasing attention to the failings of £16million summer signing Mario Balotelli.

Rodgers has missed the goals of Sturridge as well as Luis Suarez - who was sold to Barcelona in the summer - and can't wait to have his main man back.  

'It has been a difficult start, not ideal,' the Northern Irishman conceded. 'We can only continue to work well, that's all you can do. If you work hard it gives you extra confidence, and ultimately confidence will then bring you success. It is certainly something we will strive towards.

'You're always analysing, but I don't think it's so much about stripping it down and starting again with ourselves. But you need to find the answers and that is my job as manager and coach.'
