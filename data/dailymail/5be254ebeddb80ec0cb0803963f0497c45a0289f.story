Los Angeles Kings defenseman Slava Voynov has pleaded not guilty to a felony domestic violence charge, setting the stage for a March trial. 

Voynov, 24, denied causing his spouse corporal injury with great bodily injury at his re-arraignment in Los Angeles County Superior Court Monday

The Russian Olympian was arraigned after his arrest October 20 but had to go through the process again after a judge found earlier this month that there was enough evidence to proceed to trial.

A preliminary trial date of March 2 was set, and Voynov is due back in court January 28 for a pretrial hearing. If convicted, he could face up to nine years in a state prison, reported The Daily Breeze Monday. 

The two-time Stanley Cup champ is accused of choking and hitting his wife and pushing her into a a flat-screen TV in their bedroom after an argument that began at a Halloween party October 19. A cut over her eye required eight stitches.

Voynov's wife, Marta Varlamova, wrote a letter to prosecutors saying her injuries were accidental and that her husband did not intend to hurt her during an argument, though a judge didn't accept that evidence during the preliminary hearing.

The woman moved back with the hockey star a short time later.  

Voynov has been indefinitely suspended by the NHL while the case is pending.

During a preliminary hearing two weeks ago, officer Gregory Wiist, of the police force in suburban Redondo Beach, said he spoke to Marta Varlamova in a hospital after the domestic incident in October.

'She was crying, sobbing,' Wiist said. 'I saw tears streaming down her face. She was an emotional wreck.'

Wiist said Varlamova had a bleeding cut above her left eye and red marks on her neck and told him she was involved in a physical altercation with her husband.

According to Wiist's testimony, Varlamova told him the couple argued at a Halloween party on the night of October 19, where Voynov punched her in the face.

When they went home, the argument continued and Voynov threw her to the ground repeatedly, kicked her and choked her in an attack that continued until she was pushed into a television, suffering a cut on her head.

Voynov, who took his wife to a hospital, was later arrested there after medical staff called police.

Voynov, who has denied wrong-doing, was promptly suspended by the NHL, who fined the Kings $100,000 this month for allowing him to skate with the team during a practice.

Voynov, of Chelyabinsk, Russia, won two Stanley Cup championships with the Kings in 2012 and 2014.

The NHL star's attorney, Craig Renetzy, has said that the incident was no more than an accident.

The couple were reportedly shocked when officers arrested Voynov at the hospital.
