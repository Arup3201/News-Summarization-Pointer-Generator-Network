Jack Froese suddenly died in June 2011 aged just 32 from a heart arrhythmia, leaving behind a number of grieving friends and family.

But five months after his death, some of those who were closest to him started receiving mysterious emails from his account mentioning private conversations they had had with him just before his death.

The family of the Pennsylvania man say no one had his account password and they don't believe it was hacked.

Shocked: Gary Hart, left, was stunned to receive an email from his friend Jack Froese, right, months after his premature death last year

One of the recipients is his childhood friend Tim Hart of Dunbar who said the men had been 'inseparable' for 17 years and right up until his death. Â 

'He was my right-hand man and best friend,' Mr Hart told the BBC.

Mr Hart was stunned to receive a message from his old friend months after his tragic death.

'One night in November, I was sitting on my couch, going through my emails on my phone and it popped up, "sender: Jack Froese".

Tim Hart says he received the email from Jack, pictured, five months after his death which referred to a private conversation the two had

'I turned ghost white when I read it,' he told the BBC.

'It was very quick and short but to a point that only Jack and I could relate on.'

In the subject heading of the message
 read the words 'I'm Watching', and the email then went onto say: 'Did you 
hear me? I'm at your house. Clean your f***ing attic!!!'

Mr
 Hart said that shortly before Mr Froese's death, the two had a conversation
 in his attic, during which his friend teased him over the mess and dust in 
it.

'Just he and I up there. That's it,' Mr Hart said.

Mr Froese's cousin Jimmy McGraw also said he received a posthumous email from him about an ankle injury that happened after his death.

The email read: 'Hey Jim, How ya doing? I knew you were gonna break your ankle, tried to warn you. Gotta be careful.'

Mr McGraw says he had broken his ankle a week before he received the email on the night of November 21.

'I'd like to say Jack sent it, just 
because I look at it as he's gone, but he's still trying to connect with
 me,' he said.

'Trying to tell me to move along, to feel better.'

The email also included another message 
for a friend, whom 'Jack' said he 'couldn't get through to' because the 
'email didn't work'.

The source of the emails remains a mystery for Mr Froese's family and friends who say they have 'accepted them as a gift'.

Mr Hart says: 'If somebody's joking around, I don't care because I take it whatever way I want.'

Mr Hart replied to the email but has not received a reply.

The friends say they do not plan to investigate the source of the emails too closely, as they prefer to see the messages as blessings from Mr Froese than as part of some sort of prank.

Mr Froese's mother Patty told the BBC: 'I thought they were fantastic, they were great.

'They made some people happy, they upset some people - but to me, that's keeping people talking about him.'

There are services which promise to send emails to one's friends and relatives in the event of one's death, which could explain the strange phenomenon.

However, the apparent specificity of the message received by Mr McGraw may rule out this explanation.
