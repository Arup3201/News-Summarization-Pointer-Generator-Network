Britain's first superyacht hotel has sailed into London. 

The 394ft, four star, five storey Sunborn Yacht was pulled along the Thames in April and opened to guests on Wednesday. 

Situated in Royal Victoria Dock, within sight of the Millennium Dome – it is the Capital's only floating hotel.

Room prices start from £160 per night, which isn't bad for a superyacht. By comparison: chartering a luxury yacht for a week costs tens of thousands of pounds, and a London hotel room is an average £127 a night.

It certainly looks every inch the ship of dreams - though it isn't actually sea-worthy – and the interiors reflect traditional cruise-liners – shiny brass railings, teak wood panelling, spiral staircase, centre piece chandelier, art-deco wall lights, slightly off-putting swirly carpeting, plus very heavy doors that won't budge in a squall.

It's popular, according to the General Manager, Andreas Stys, for special occasions.

George R R Martin, author of Game of Thrones, extended his visit during the World Science Fiction Convention held at the ExCel centre, (which the yacht is parked next to), in August.

Floating hotels have become something of a worldwide trend – Sunborn has another yacht moored off Gibraltar

It's become a popular hotspot for marriage proposals too. 

Those popping the question might consider booking into the Executive Suite at the bow of the ship – with its own balcony, plus sun loungers – as well as a Jacuzzi, sauna and double shower. 

The view from the bedroom looks out onto the converted warehouses on the other side of the dock.

The ship even has a wedding license – so you could go the whole hog and come back to celebrate anniversaries (as many people do, apparently).

Rooms are said to offer five metres square more space than equivalent hotels in London. 

They feel spacious, even at entry level, though the bathrooms are small. All rooms have tablets rather than a traditional hotel menu and free wifi.

Sunborn had a yacht hotel in a similar spot, from 2002 to 2008, in the same industrial-feeling mooring. 

The bigger (and newly refurbished) ship looks directly up at planes taking off from City Airport, which is exciting to behold at night, if less thrilling to witness first thing in the morning.

Guests would be advised to book rooms facing out onto the water. Portside rooms come with considerably less inspiring views of the ExCel centre.

Floating hotels are experiencing something of a worldwide trend – Sunborn has another, five star yacht moored off Gibraltar – and there are more buoyant palaces mooted. 

The Krystall hotel, designed by Dutch Docklands and set for completion at the end of 2016, will be moored off Tromso in Norway. 

It looks like a floating snowflake and has a glass roof offering views of the Northern Lights. 

The same company is behind Ocean Flower in the Maldives – a collection of 185 floating villas in a flower-shaped configuration.
