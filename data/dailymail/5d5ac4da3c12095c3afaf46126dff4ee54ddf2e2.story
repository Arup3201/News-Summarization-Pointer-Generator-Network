Miriam Clegg has denied claims she put pressure on her husband to take a tougher stance on Lord Rennard

Nick Clegg’s wife has angrily hit back at claims that she put pressure on her husband to take a tougher stance on sex-pest allegations against Lord Rennard.

In a highly unusual public statement, Miriam Clegg insisted she had nothing to do with the decision to suspend the peer from the party, describing a report suggesting so as ‘a complete fabrication’.

The lawyer and mother of three, who was attending a National Inspiring Women campaign event to get women to go into schools to talk about their careers, said: ‘This is in the Telegraph today but it is a complete fabrication. I don’t even know the women [complainants].

‘I think by now that you will know I’m the kind of woman who doesn’t influence in the shadows. If I ever wanted to say something, I would say that openly. My opinions about the political issues of the day, I keep them for myself.’

Earlier, Mr Clegg said it was ‘just not on’ to drag his family into the row and dismissed the claims as ‘garbage’.

‘I’ve read so much garbage over the last several days about what I think, what my motives are, what I’ve done here, what I’ve done there, and now suddenly claims are being made about conversations which, if they took place, would take place probably in the privacy of the Clegg kitchen,’ he told LBC radio.

‘It’s total garbage, it is a complete work of fiction. Look, you can make up stuff about me, as indeed people do day in day out, have a go at me, but just don’t drag Miriam into it, don’t drag politicians’ families into it. That’s just not on.’

Mr Clegg yesterday admitted his handling of groping allegations against Lord Rennard last year was ‘not ideal’ as he vowed not to back down in calling for an apology from the Lib Dem peer.

He also conceded that ‘alarm bells did not go off’ within the party when the allegations were first made several years ago.

Former party chief executive Lord Rennard denies any wrongdoing and is threatening to sue the Lib Dems for suspending his membership after refusing to say sorry to his alleged victims.
