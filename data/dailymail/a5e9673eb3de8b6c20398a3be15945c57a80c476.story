IF you’re a pessimist who thinks a leopard can’t change its spots, just read on.

For researchers claim you can teach yourself to be an optimist in as little as seven weeks.

And there are even more reasons to be positive: the training consists of two simple excercises. One involves looking at smiley and angry faces and the other is a 20 minute meditation exercise.

Are you an optimist or a pessimist? Scroll down for the expert test

Michael Mosley has his brain activity monitored at Essex University before he embarks on two 'treatments' for pessimism. Results reveal that the right side of his brain is far more active than the left, a trait associated with anxious and neurotic people

By practising them regularly, scientists have shown the brain can change the way it works – therefore transforming a pessimist’s outlook on life.

The findings were aired in a BBC documentary last night which investigated the science behind people’s personalities and whether it was possible to change them.

Viewers watched as presenter Michael Mosley, who has suffered with chronic insomnia for the past 20 years, explained how he wanted to become a ‘warmer, happier person and to sleep better’.

The father-of-four had his brain tested at Essex University by Professor Elaine Fox, a leading researcher into the science of optimism.

The results showed he had more activity in parts of brain associated with negativity, pessimism and a strong tendency to look on the dark side of life.

Research has shown that with certain mental exercises you can learn to see that the glass of life is half full

Past studies have found people who are prone to high levels of pessimism, neuroticism and anxiety suffer from ‘cerebral asymmetry’, where there is greater activity on the right side of their brain than the left. The cause of this is not yet known.

By analysing electrical activity in the brain, experts were able to show that the right side of Mr Mosley’s brain was three times more active than the left when in its resting state.

Professor Fox suggested Mr Mosley should undertake two forms of mental training daily.

The meditation excercise involved sitting in a quiet place and focusing on physical sensations, such as the weight of his body or breathing, for 20 minutes.

He met a former monk who told him about the ancient art of mindfulness, a form of meditation. The monk said said that everyone could benefit from taking ten to 20 minutes out of each day to cut off from the outside world and ‘live in the moment’.

The trick was to start doing this exercise for ten minutes, then build up to 20 minutes each time.

Eventually the technique enables the person to let their thoughts come and go freely without ruminating on them.

The second exercise involved looking at a screen  showing 15 blank or angry faces, and one smiley face.

Mr Mosley had to spot the smiling face and click on it. A new set of faces then appeared.

The idea behind the excerise was to train his brain to look for positive images. By regularly doing this, it is thought the brain learns to tune into positive thoughts more easily.

Michael Mosley visit a brain bank containing the brains of 3000 humans. Experts hope that by analysing the organs, they will be able to better understand the way people think

After seven weeks, Mr Mosley felt his mood lifting, he started sleeping better and felt more optimistic. He then returned to the lab to see if his brain had in fact changed.

Mr Mosley was told the ‘asymmetrical’ levels of his brain activity had become more equalised – a strong indicator he had become more optimistic.

In addition to this, his scores when reacting to the brain training game had changed. He reacted more quickly to happy faces and more slowly to sad faces, indicating he was not seeking out negativity as much.

Dr Mosley told BBC2 programme, Horizon: The Truth about Personality: ‘I feel quite frankly astonished that you can notice that much change in just seven weeks. I set out to see if it was possible to change my mind and I think I might have done it. I am absolutely thrilled.’

Mindfulness, a form or meditation, is an ancient practice that involves focussing a person's awareness and attention but at the same time maintaining a sense 
of calmness and relaxation.

Try working this exercise into your routine each day for 10 minutes and slowly build up to 20 if you want to try and change your mindset.
