Only two lines long and dashed off with a typically witty flourish, the scribbled note scarcely amounts to a hard day’s work.

But even a hastily scribbled postcard can become a valuable artefact when written by Sir Paul McCartney.

The greeting, sent by the Beatles star from his farmhouse on the Mull of Kintyre, fetched almost £1,000 at auction earlier this week.

This postcard, featuring a Scotty dog with a tartan border and the message 'Should auld acquaintance be forgot?' was sent by Paul McCartney from his farmhouse on the Mull of Kintyre

Posted to his London housekeeper Rose, the brief handwritten message read: 'With love from the “four Macs”. Now on tour in Scotland.’

Sir Paul spent weeks at his bolthole with wife Linda and daughters Heather and Mary after the band split in 1970. But he kept in touch with his London housekeeper, Rose Martin, sending a card featuring a Scotty dog, tartan, lucky white heather and the lyrics ‘Should auld acquaintance be forgot?’.

A brief note on the back reads: ‘With love from the “four Macs”. Now on tour in Scotland.’

With a Campbeltown postmark and an upside-down stamp, it went under the hammer in Warrington, near the band’s native Liverpool, as part of a sale of Beatles memorabilia on Tuesday.

Organiser Omega Auctions had valued it at between £250 and £350 – but it went for £950.

Auctioneer Paul Fairweather said: ‘Such intimate, personal and unique things give Beatles and Paul McCartney collectors an insight into how life was for him back then, and very rarely come up for sale.’

Sir Paul, now 72, bought 600-acre High Park Farm on the Kintyre peninsula in 1966 at the height of The Beatles’ success, while living with actress Jane Asher.

He has said he was inspired to write The Beatles hit The Long And Winding Road by the estate’s ‘wandering single-track roads and sense of solace’. After he married Linda Eastman in 1969, the couple turned the modest farmhouse into a holiday retreat.

When the band broke up, the McCartneys headed there to get away from the limelight.

The couple later immortalised their love of the area in the hit song Mull Of Kintyre, which took their band Wings to the Christmas No 1 spot in 1977. The most successful single of his solo career, it went on to sell 2.5 million copies.

Sir Paul once said of the track: ‘It was a love song, really, about how I enjoyed being there and imagining I was travelling away and wanting to get back.’
