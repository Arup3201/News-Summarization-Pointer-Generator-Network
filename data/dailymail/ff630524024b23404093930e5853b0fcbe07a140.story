He's been labelled the 'Mozart of football' by Radomir Antic, 'from another planet' by Arda Turan and the equivalent of 'having an orgasm' by Luis Figo.

Lionel Messi is celebrating 10 years since his league debut for Barcelona - a decade which has seen the forward play 434 games for the La Liga giants.

Here, Sportsmail narrows down 10 of the four-time Ballon d'Or winner's best games.

Barcelona 4-0 Viktoria Plzen (Champions League, 2011)

Barcelona won the Champions League the year before, and were defending their crown in Prague.

Up against Viktoria Plzen, Messi's first goal brought his Barcelona tally to 200. Not satisfied with the milestone, the forward added two more to complete his hat-trick against the Czech club.

Messi was the top scorer in the competition that year, too, as well as 2009, 2010 and 2012.

Barcelona 3-3 Real Madrid (La Liga, 2007)

Ten-man Barcelona came from behind three times to salvage a point thanks to a hat-trick from a certain 19-year-old.

In front of 97,823 fans, Messi hit his third in the 87th minute to send the Nou Camp faithful berserk.

It came after a three-month absence for Messi, who broke his foot earlier in the year.

Barcelona 4-0 Santos (FIFA Club World Cup final, 2011)

It was billed as Messi vs Neymar, and there are no prizes going for guessing who won.

Messi was scintillating at the International Stadium in Japan as he scored twice in the final, was named man of the match and won player of the tournament, too. 

All in a day's work for the man who now calls Neymar his team-mate.

Barcelona 3-1 Manchester United (Champions League final, 2011)

A Champions League final in England against Manchester United was potentially daunting - but not for Messi.

The Barcelona maestro, winning UEFA and the fans' man of the match, scored the second goal - his 12th of the competition - and condemned Sir Alex Ferguson to Champions League heartbreak.

Afterwards, Barca boss Pep Guardiola said: 'Lionel Messi is the best player I've ever seen, probably the best ever. He made the difference. Messi is unique, a one-off.'

Real Madrid 3-4 Barcelona (La Liga, 2014) 

Another Clasico, another hat-trick. In March, three against Barcelona's greatest rivals saw Messi surpass Alfredo Di Stefano as the outright all-time top scorer between the  Spanish giants.

Messi has 21 goals to Di Stefano's 18 (and Cristiano Ronaldo's 13) in the El Clasico fixture.

Estudiantes 1-2 Barcelona (FIFA Club World Cup final, 2009)

Talk about getting something off your chest. Messi scored the extra-time winner in this Abu Dhabi final to keep a Barcelona side hell-bent on world domination on track.

Messi's goal, using his chest to put the ball beyond goalkeeper Damian Albil, meant Barca bagged their sixth trophy of the year (Copa del Rey, La Liga, Champions League, Spanish Supercup, European Supercup, and Club World Cup).

Two days later, Messi was crowned FIFA World Player of the Year. Not a bad week.

Barcelona 4-1 Arsenal (Champions League quarter-final, 2010)

Sorry, Arsenal fans, but you knew this was on its way.

Messi single-handedly destroyed Arsene Wenger's Arsenal at the Nou Camp with four goals after Nicklas Bendtner put the Premier League club ahead.

Barca won 6-3 on aggregate and the No 10's goals - each as brilliant as the last - led Wenger to praise the man that had just cut his team in to smithereens.

'He's like a PlayStation,' he said. 'I think he can take advantage of every mistake you make.'

Barcelona 2-0 Manchester United (Champions League final, 2009)

Messi, so often praised for his feet, showed exactly what he can do with his head in Rome.

Yet again the orchestrator, the forward leapt to meet Xavi's perfectly-looped cross to kill the tie off after Samuel Eto'o had given Barca the lead.

Some have labelled it the best header they've ever seen for its importance and sheer unique quality. 

Either way, it certainly took any eyes away from United No 7 Ronaldo in the opposite corner.

Barcelona 4-0 Bayern Munich (Champions League quarter-final, 2009) 

Just when Bayern Munich were eager on orchestrating their own world domination, Messi knocked the German club back to earth with two goals and an assist in a 4-0 romping at the Nou Camp.

Not waiting around, Messi scored his double in the first half to kill off any threat from Bayern.

This was all part of a season that saw Messi win his first Ballon d'Or - an award he would win in 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012.

Barcelona 5-2 Getafe (Copa del Rey semi-final, 2007)

No-one ever remembers Messi's beauty into the top-right corner, do they?

It's all about his first against Getafe - a dribble that  draws comparisons with Argentina legend Diego Maradona's 1986 World Cup run against England.

Messi dribbled past not one, not two, but five Getafe players from his own half, before slotting the ball into the back of the net. It came six months after his 'Hand of Goal' replica, too.
