A baby boy suffered severe brain damage after midwives failed to notice that he was dangerously jaundiced after his birth.

Khan Gold, now 19 months, was born perfectly healthy and allowed home the following day.

Over the next four days he was seen five times by three midwives, who told his parents, Ed and Laura-Faye Gold, that his jaundice was nothing to worry about.

In fact, his level of bilirubin – a noxious substance that turns the skin yellow and can damage the brain – was soaring.

Not until Mrs Gold, 32, called her local hospital to say her son was arching his back as if in pain did anyone suggest bringing him in. He was finally put in intensive care and given a transfusion.

But by then, the bilirubin had caused a rare form of brain damage known as kernicterus. It means doctors are uncertain whether Khan will ever walk or talk, and he is likely to need 24-hour care all his life. 

Now, his devastated family are speaking about their ordeal for the first time to warn other parents of the dangers.

Last night Mr Gold, 41, an electrician, said: ‘We feel so disappointed, so let down and heartbroken. Khan was born a healthy baby boy and, although he had a bit of jaundice, we were reassured by the midwives at each visit.

‘The midwives didn’t seem to know this could happen. We feel a sense of loss, loss because my wife gave birth to a healthy child who was taken from us at five days old.’

Mrs Gold, a florist, gave birth to Khan, her fifth child, at Exeter Hospital last year and midwives suggested taking him out in the sunshine to help his jaundice 

Jaundice, or yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes, is caused by excess bilirubin. The chemical is produced as red blood cells break down, and is normally removed from the blood by the liver.

Because newborns’ livers are not fully developed, six out of ten will suffer jaundice to some extent.

Mrs Gold, a florist, gave birth to Khan, her fifth child, at Exeter Hospital on April 15, 2013. He was seen by three midwives at home in Luppitt, near Honiton, and they suggested taking him out in the sunshine to help his jaundice.

But by the evening of April 20, the jaundice had spread. Khan had problems feeding and was arching his back and neck unnaturally.

The Golds rang the local hospital. Doctors did a blood test, but then told the couple they would have to drive Khan and his blood sample to Exeter Hospital in their own car.

On arrival, Mr Gold said, countless tests were carried out until a senior consultant was called in – and quickly realised jaundice was to blame. 

Khan had a transfusion to replace half the blood in his body and spent a week under special lights that break down bilirubin. Then, the consultant told them to prepare for a serious brain injury.

Jaundice is the condition which refers to a yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes caused by a build-up of bilirubin the blood and tissues of the body.

Bilirubin is a waste product that's produced when red blood cells break down. It is transported in the bloodstream to the liver

Jaundice can also be a side effect of liver damage, cirrohsis, gallstones, tumours, malaria and sickle cell anaemia.

Newborn babies are often born with the symptoms of jaundice, but usually in the young it resolves itself without treatment.

Maintaining a healthy weight and managing alcohol intake can reduce the risk of developing the condition.

‘Our world dropped away, we were just devastated,’ Mr Gold added.

Bosses at the Royal Devon and Exeter NHS Foundation Trust wrote to the family in September, apologising for the ‘failures’ that caused Khan’s brain damage. The Golds are seeking compensation, expected to run into seven figures. 

‘No amount will ever compensate for what happened, but we want to make sure Khan is looked after when we are gone,’ Mr Gold said.

He added: ‘It’s very difficult for us to see other families with their children running around, knowing Khan is unlikely to ever play with his siblings in that way.

‘We just want to warn other parents about the risks and ensure the hospital makes whatever changes are necessary to prevent this from happening to any other child.’

Their lawyer Eddie Jones, of JMW Solicitors, said: ‘The lack of appreciation of the danger Khan was in would suggest there are training issues at the hospital trust that need to be addressed urgently.’

In a letter to the family, Angela Pedder, chief executive of the trust, admitted Khan did not ‘receive the treatment he should have done’, adding: ‘I would like to offer my sincere apology and deep regret for those failures.’

Trust spokesman Jeff Chinnock said: ‘Lessons have been learned to ensure the risk of this happening again is minimised.’
