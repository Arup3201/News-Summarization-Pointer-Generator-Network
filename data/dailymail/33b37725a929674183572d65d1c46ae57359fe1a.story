A secretive Chinese company that was accused last week of posing a threat to America's national security is being investigated over a controversial £2.5 billion deal with British Telecom.

The inquiry by an influential group of MPs is understood to have been sparked by concerns raised by spymasters over the growth in cyber attacks emanating from China.

At the centre of the inquiry is China's biggest telecommunication corporation, Huawei, which has a contract with BT to play a leading role in a £2.5 billion plan to roll out super-fast broadband to two-thirds of UK homes and offices by 2015.

Fears: The inquiry into Huawei is understood to have been sparked by spymasters

Malcolm Rifkind, chairman of the Security and Intelligence Committee, told The Mail on Sunday that his report would be with the Prime Minister by the end of the year and would include evidence gathered about the involvement of the Government in the seven-year relationship between BT and Huawei.

The findings could be deeply embarrassing for David Cameron, who only last month personally endorsed Huawei's business in the UK when he met Ren Zhengfei, the  company's president.

The US House of Representatives Intelligence Committee last week accused Huawei and ZTE, another Chinese company, of leaving the US open to espionage and cyber attack.

Last year, Britain's most senior trade official was at the centre of a row after landing a lucrative job with the controversial Chinese telecoms giant.

Sir Andrew Cahn, former head of UK Trade & Investment, was appointed chairman of the UK advisory board of Huawei.

The Security and Intelligence Committee is already looking at the cyber threat posed by Russia and China, which are suspected of carrying out the majority of electronic attacks against UK interests.

Security chiefs are understood to be most worried about how foreign telecoms companies might be able to damage or control UK infras­tructure should their home states have hostile intentions against British interests.

A BT spokesman said: 'We work closely with Huawei on commercial security best practice and our relationship is managed strictly in accordance with UK laws.'

A Huawei spokesman said the company had worked with the Government to create a 'rigorous and sophisticated assurance system for telecoms equipment regularly tested by government security experts'.
