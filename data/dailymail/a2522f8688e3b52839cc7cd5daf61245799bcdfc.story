Indiana sophomore Devin Davis is improving after being struck by a teammate's car and suffering a head injury, the school said Sunday.

The university issued a news release quoting team physician Dr. Larry Rink as saying Davis was 'doing better' Sunday morning and had benefited from uninterrupted rest.

'His speech is normal and he has the use of all extremities,' Rink said.

The news release did not indicate the 19-year-old's medical condition. He had been listed in serious condition Saturday at IU Health Bloomington Hospital.

Bloomington police say they found Davis unconscious early Saturday after he was struck by an SUV driven by teammate Emmitt Holt outside of Memorial Stadium. They say Holt had dropped off Davis and was driving away when Davis re-entered the roadway about 12:45 a.m. and collided with the front passenger side of the SUV.

Coach Tom Crean issued a statement Sunday, saying the team was looking forward to Davis's continued recovery.

'Too often in life, we all take for granted the simple tasks of opening our eyes, processing thoughts and putting a simple sentence together,' Crean said. 'In our program, we routinely emphasize to our players that everything matters and watching Devin improve just over the last 36 hours has furthered our belief in that approach.'

Crean said the Davis family and the team appreciated 'the concern, calls, texts, and thoughts and prayers we have received.'

Davis' family also issued a statement Sunday night.

'As all parents can understand, the last 40+ hours have been difficult for us and for all of those who care about our son. Devin's condition is improving and we know that there is a road to recovery ahead,' the family said.

Scene: Holt was dropping Davis outside of Memorial Stadium (pictured)early Saturday morning when the incident happened. Holt was cited for underage drinking and for being a minor, operating a vehicle with a blood alcohol content over 0.02. The school says he had a BAC of 0.025, which would not be considered impaired if he were over the legal age limit 

'We want to thank the incredible team at IU Health Bloomington Hospital for taking such great care of Devin. We also want to express our gratitude to coach Crean, who has been by Devin's bedside for most of the past two days and to all of his coaches, teammates and the extended Hoosier family who have kept him in their prayers.'

Davis played a minor role for the Hoosiers last season, averaging 2.4 points and 2.6 rebounds in 8.8 minutes per game. This year, the 6-foot-7, 230-pound forward from Indianapolis was expected to be a key player in the middle this season. The Hoosiers have only four players who are listed taller than Davis, and three are freshmen.

Holt, a 6-foot-7 forward from Webster, New York, was cited for misdemeanor illegal consumption of alcohol and for being a minor operating a vehicle with a blood-alcohol content above 0.02, Bloomington Police Sgt. Jeffery Canada said. The school said Saturday that Holt's BAC was 0.025.

In September, junior guard Yogi Ferrell and sophomore guard Stanford Robinson entered pretrial diversion programs after being charged in April with consumption of an alcoholic beverage by a minor and possession of false identification. Junior forward Hanner Mosquera-Perea was arrested in Bloomington in February on preliminary drunk driving charges.

Indiana opens the season Nov. 14 against Mississippi Valley State.
