Two teenagers missing from their homes for almost two weeks have been found safe and well.

A member of the public recognised Charlotte Ford, 15, and her 16-year-old boyfriend, Luke Jarvis, and called in the police.

Officers in Rhyl, north Wales, acting on the information tracked down the young couple at around 2pm earlier today.

Find them: Missing Charlotte Ford, 15, and her 'on-off' boyfriend Luke Jarvis, 16. The couple were last seen at Dudley bus station on Sunday before they were recognised by a member of the public

West Midlands police had launched an 
inquiry to find the missing teenagers after they had gone missing from 
their homes in Bilston and Wordsley.

And their parents issued an emotional
appeal for their return at a press conference after CCTV footage showed
them boarding a bus together on Sunday.

Superintendent Stuart Johnson, from 
Dudley police, said: 'The response we have seen from the media and 
members of the public has been excellent. My sincere thanks for that 
assistance.'

And he added: 'We are now able to reunite the youngsters with their families.'

CCTV footage show the couple clearly walking through Dudley bus station at 4.48pm on Sunday, June 26

It had been feared that the couple may have been sleeping rough.

Charlotte, from Wordsley, 
Stourbridge, had not been seen by her family since June 27 after telling
her parents she was going to meet a friend close near to her home in 
Bilston, in the West Midlands.

She had failed to meet up with the friend or return home and her frantic mother and father reported her missing.

Luke was reported missing from his home in Bilston, on July 1, but had not been seen by any family members since June 27.

CCTV revealed Charlotte and Luke had been seen together at Dudley bus station on Sunday, June 26 at around 5pm.

happened, it doesn't matter what the circumstances are, we really miss 
you. We love you no matter what.

'Get in a taxi and we will pay for it. Just come home please.'

Andrew Ford, Charlotte's father, said: 'You're not in any trouble.'
