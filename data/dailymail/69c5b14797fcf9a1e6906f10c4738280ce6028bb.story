Tourism chiefs in Spain are set to mount a £400,000 PR drive to persuade holidaymakers Magaluf is still a viable family destination after a bar sex scandal involving a British teenager.

Officials were due to meet with British Embassy representatives in Madrid today to discuss a joint campaign to clean up the party resort's image.

Local politicians want to follow police clampdowns on potential licensing breaches by bars and unruly behaviour by tourists with a costly publicity push targeted in the UK to persuade tourists Magaluf is not all sex and cheap alcohol.

Party capital: Magaluf, popular for its cheap clubs and bars, has earned its reputation as one of the top places for drinking and clubbing holidays in Europe. It is especially popular with British tourists (file picture)

The move 
comes after a British teenager was filmed performing a sex act on 24 men
 in a Magaluf bar - apparently for a free drink - after an eight-hour 
drinking binge organised by controversial firm Carnage Magalluf.

Two
 British brothers thought to own a lapdancing club, bars and hotels in 
the resort are said to be the brains behind the company, although a 
fellow Brit is listed as its sole director.

Local
 Civil Guard officers have identified the bar - Alex's Place - where the public sex act 
occurred and its owner but say there is no evidence a crime was 
committed.

Margarita Najera, ex-mayoress of Calvia, which covers the resort of Magaluf, called for the bar to be shut down anyway.

She
 said: ‘The first thing that should be done is to close the bar that's 
promoting these type of practices because it's degrading.

‘This sort of thing shouldn't be allowed and it would serve as a warning to others not to repeat it.’

Spain's
 Secretary of State for Tourism, Isabel Borrego, said: ‘We're talking 
with the Balearic Islands' regional government about what needs to be 
done and what messages and measures need to be put in place to ensure 
this sort of thing never happens again in a holiday destination.

‘There
 will be a joint publicity campaign against this sort of thing, focusing
 on the fact we want responsible and quality tourism.’

Holiday
 rep Alan Collinson, 28, who leads the bar crawls, wrote on Facebook 
after organising the bar crawl where partygoers clapped and cheered as 
the British 18-year-old performed sex acts on 24 men: ‘Don't know what 
all the fuss is about, it's an average night on a Carnage bar crawl.’

Marketing experts have told Ultima Hora the campaign would cost around £400,000.

Benefits
 Street's Dee White, one of the TV stars invited to the bar crawls to 
raise attendance, has vowed never to return following the bar scandal.

Her manager Barry Tomes said: ‘I'm completely disgusted with the whole thing.’
