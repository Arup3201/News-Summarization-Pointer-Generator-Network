Rihanna has left us all open mouthed by just how good she can look when she dons a chic dress and heels and leaves the cleavage/legs/bum bearing dresses at home.

Attending the Dior Cruise Fashion Show in Brooklyn, Rihanna was wearing head to toe Christina Dior accessorized with pearl earrings, disc necklaces and statement bracelets, showing how accessorizing can give a simple dress the wow factor.

Rihanna's dress is a great piece for Summer weddings or with gladiator sandals for daytime chic. See our selection of our favorite pink pastel dresses below, including pieces from River Island, MinkPink and Jo No Fui.

'I think, to be acknowledged by Dior is just, it means a lot as a woman to feel beautiful, and elegant, and timeless.' 

Last week, Dior's decision to cast the chart-topper as the newest face of its spring-inspired Secret Garden campaign, which is currently in its fourth year, was met with an overwhelming amount of support, both from the fashion industry, and from the label's fans. 

'#HistoRIH @rihanna is gonna be the first BLACK WOMAN to be the face of Dior!!!!!' one person tweeted, while another added: 'Huge news for @rihanna today: she's the first black woman to be the face of Dior.'

Dior confirmed that it had signed Rihanna up as its newest campaign star on Friday.

According to WWD.com, the French-based brand stated that Rihanna is set to feature in the fourth installment of the video and print series of the Secret Garden campaign, joining models such as Daria Strokus, Melissa Stasiuk and Xiao Wen Ju, all of whom have previously featured in the Secret Garden series.

While further details about the campaign have not yet been released, the fashion label confirmed that film and print versions, shot by photographer Steven Klein, 'are scheduled to run this spring'. 

Big deal: While discussing her soon-to-be-released animated movie Home, Rihanna explained how important she believes her new Dior campaign will be for 'a lot of young girls of any color'

Anticipation: The chart-topper added that she was thrilled just to be 'recognized' by the iconic French fashion label

The announcement was made just days after the popstar was spotted filming in the ornate surroundings of the Palace of Versailles in Paris, France, where all of Dior's previous Secret Garden campaigns have been shot. 

Rihanna was seen strolling through the Palace's luxurious rooms during the late night shoot, while wearing a glamorous sequin gown - and a pair of fluffy slippers.

Her thick hair was styled in luxurious waves, swept back off her face to allow her features to shine, while a bold dark lipstick spiced up the look.

Rihanna posed among a hallway of gold statues as cameras flashed away. 

Earlier that day, the star was also seen enjoying some downtime in her trailer, which was located at the Palace. 

Rihanna was pictured lying down, while having her nails done by an assistant.

Couture: The popstar was modeling a beautifully-cut black Dior gown and red leather gloves

Just a few days later, Rihanna was back at work on another night shoot at the Palace, this time posing up a storm in the estate's impressive grounds while wearing a beautifully-tailored black gown. 

The sleeveless dress featured a striking white leather waist belt which of course simply highlighted the singer's slim frame.

Adding her own signature style to the ensemble, Rihanna decided to pull down the zip featured down the front of the frock, which revealed a hint of side boob. 

This new campaign will mark Rihanna's debut as a model for the brand - however she is known to be a great fan of the brand, and is often seen wearing a variety of Dior's latest and greatest designs while frequently featuring on the front row at the label's Paris Fashion Week catwalk shows.

And while Rihanna has not previously modeled for Dior, the star does boast plenty of fashion experience, having previously modeled for the likes of Balmain and Emporio Armani, as well as appearing on numerous covers of fashion bible Vogue.

She joins the likes of Hunger Games star Jennifer Lawrence, Black Swan actress Natalie Portman and French beauty Marion Cotillard, all of whom have starred in campaigns for Dior in the past.

The last installment of the Secret Garden campaign, which debuted in May 2014, has had more than nine million views on YouTube. It was also shot at the iconic French palace. 

Making clear the key role that the historical setting plays within the campaign, Dior said of its previous video installment: 'As the eyes open upon the famed perspective of the chateau gardens and their massive geometries, as on the cusp of a dream, the Dior woman draws the spectator with her around the twists and turns of a secret and amazing Versailles.'

Known also as the Chateau de Versailles, the extravagant royal residence is located just southwest of Paris.

Three French kings lived there, including Louis XIII, Louis XIV, and Louis XV, up until the French revolution in 1789. 

Each king increased the palace’s splendour by continuing to build upon the premises.
