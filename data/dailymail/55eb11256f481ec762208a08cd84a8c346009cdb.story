It was a disaster that in one sharp instant brought the grim reality of World War II thundering home.

On April 30, 1940, Frederick Gill and his wife Dorothy became the first British civilian casualties of WWII when a German bomber loaded with mines slammed onto their home in Calcton, Essex.

The twin-engined Heinkel, which had been circling over the seaside town for about 30 minutes,  smashed into the quiet residential Victoria Street, obliterating most of the Gills' home.

Forgotten fund: The ledger and account book of the fund set up in the wake of the disaster

As well as the two killed, 160 people were injured and 67 houses damaged, some severely. Eyewitness Ron Guyott, 82, who was nine at the time remembers: 'I was in bed asleep. It (the crash ) blew in all the windows.

'Luckily the night blinds kept us clear of it. It looked as though (the plane) was sitting on top of a house' 

The local community rallied to help and in the wake of the tragedy, a 
disaster fund was set up to help local residents who had been affected 
by the crash and by enemy raids.

Generosity: The ledger shows donations to the fund, including one from famous band leaders Joe Loss & Billy Cotton. It was not just local people that donated but people from across Britain

The fund was administered by a number
of CUDC officials and continued to be used throughout the war to help 
anyone affected by enemy air activity.

Of course after the war there was little use 
for the money and in 1946 the remaining balance of £243, 13 shillings 
and six pence was deposited into a Post Office Savings bank account and 
simply forgotten about.

But now over 70 years after it was 
first set up, a ledger containing details of the fund has been 
discovered during an office move at Clacton Town hall and with interest 
over the years it is worth around £1,700.

Currently the only commemoration to the crash is this small plaque on a 
bench. But councillors hope the money from the account can be used to 
create a memorial

The fund was originally established 
by the Rev HG Redgrave, then Chairman of Clacton Urban District Council 
(CUDC), after the Heinkel came down in Victoria Road, Clacton, on April 
30, 1940,

Although a bench and plaque already 
exist to mark the tragedy, Tendring District Council (TDC) is now 
looking to use the remaining money to enhance the site, creating a focal
point and memorial which could be signposted from the town's seafront.

Alan Goggin, TDC's Cabinet Member for
Tourism, said that the fund and documents are an important part of the 
town's historical past and suggested a memorial on the spot where the 
Heinkel came down.
