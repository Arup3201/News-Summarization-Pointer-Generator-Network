A husband convicted of killing his wife underwater more than a decade ago is a free man again after a panel of judges overturned the ruling.

It was alleged David Swain, 55, killed Shelley Tyre, 46, by tearing off her scuba mask as they swam by a shipwreck in the British Virgin Islands.

But the expert diver today walked free after appeal judges found problems with jury instructions read by a judge during the trial in 2009.

Swain, of Rhode Island, has protested his innocence since she died in 1999, claiming he tried to revive her with CPR after an accident.

Now Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court of Appeal judges have found problems with jury instructions read out during the trial.

The court did not order a new trial because of concerns about recalling defence witnesses, given the amount of time passed since the death.

‘I feel elated,’ Swain said as he left court with his daughter Jennifer Swain Bloom, who has also long maintained her father's innocence.

He said the two intend to return to Rhode Island ‘sooner rather than later.’

A jury had unanimously convicted Swain in October 2009 of murdering Ms Tyre in what authorities described as a near-perfect crime.

He was ordered to serve at least 25 years of a mandatory life sentence.

But defence lawyer J.S. Archibald argued the judge did not adequately advise the jury on how to handle evidence from a related civil suit.

Authorities initially ruled Tyre's drowning near an isolated shipwreck at a depth of 80ft as an accident.

But they later charged Swain with murder following a 2006 civil trial in Rhode Island that found him responsible for her death.

The civil jury awarded Ms Tyre's family $3.5million, and Swain later filed for bankruptcy.

Prosecutors had argued that Swain killed Tyre because he was in love with another woman and wanted to obtain his wife's money.

Their case rested largely on experts who believed Swain attacked his wife from behind, yanked off her scuba mask and cut off her air supply.

Authorities said her mask was damaged, the mouthpiece of her snorkel was missing, and that her fin was found embedded in a sandbar.

When dive shop owner Swain was sentenced
to at least 25 years in jail, the world believed that the mystery which began
in 1999 when his wife's body was found floating had been closed 
for good.

But Thursday's news of an overturned conviction is just another chapter in an amazing story.

Police at first wrote off her drowning as a tragic accident - a strange but otherwise unremarkable death of an experienced diver on a romantic getaway to one of the world's premier dive spots.

Prosecutors accused him of drowning his wife on the last day of their holiday so he could pursue a romance with a Rhode Island chiropractor as well as gain his wife's inheritance of $630,000.

But defence lawyers maintained a poor post-mortem report could not rule out medical reasons for her death, including the possibility she had a heart attack or stroke during an accidental drowning.

The case, which attracted TV shows including 'Dateline NBC,' produced one of the most sensational trials in the history of the tiny British Caribbean territory, where violence is relatively rare.
