Five... four... three... two... one. Thunderbirds are go! (again).

The classic 1960s television series, which was as much loved for its rousing introduction as its puppets' jerky movements, is set to return to the small screen 50 years after it first went on air. 

But, perhaps to the disappointment of its more mature fans, the show has been given a thoroughly 21st century makeover.

Gone is the 'Supermarionation' puppet technique pioneered by co-creators Gerry and Sylvia Anderson, replaced instead by a mix of modern cutting-edge CGI animation and live action miniature sets.

Classic 1960s television series Thunderbirds is set to return to the small screen 50 years after it first went on air

But, perhaps to the disappointment of its more mature fans, the show has been given a 21st century makeover

Thunderbirds are Go! will return to the small screen on ITV in 2015 - 50 years after the classic programme featuring the exploits of International Rescue first screened. 

The series will 'affectionately pay tribute' to the classic show, created by Mr Anderson, who died in December 2012 at the age of 83.

Producers say it will feature a 'whole new level of action-adventure animation for today's audience', with the five Tracy brothers piloting their 'incredible vehicles into impossible rescues across the globe'.

The series will star Rosamund Pike - of Pride and Prejudice, and Gone Girl - as Lady Penelope and original cast member David Graham who reprises his role as Parker.

Other star voices will include Kayvan Novak (Fonejacker, Facejacker) as inventor Brains and Thomas Brodie-Sangster (Game of Thrones, Love Actually) voicing John Tracy.

It is a co-production between ITV Studios and Pukeko Pictures in association with world-famous Weta Workshop, responsible for big screen hits such as The Lord of the Rings, and Avatar.

Thunderbirds, created by Anderson and his second wife, Sylvia, was first broadcast in 1965.

With the catchphrase 'Thunderbirds are go!' and featuring the secret emergency service run by the Tracy family, aided by London agent Lady Penelope and her butler, Parker, it enjoyed a resurgence in popularity in the 1990s.

In 1966, Thunderbirds was made into a major feature film, Thunderbirds Are Go, which was followed by a sequel two years later, Thunderbird 6. 

The major new children's series is set to make its international debut in early 2015 in the UK on ITV and CITV.
