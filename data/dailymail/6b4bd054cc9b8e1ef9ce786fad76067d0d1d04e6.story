An investigation has been launched after an innocent 13-year-old girl was killed last night after she was hit by a car that was being chased by police.

The girl was sitting in the back of a Volkswagen Polo, with members of her family, when her car was hit by a Peugeot 308 at 6.24 pm yesterday.

The police pursued the Peugeot's driver 
after the car's registration number triggered an alert on the police's 
in-car computer system which targets uninsured drivers and other 
suspected minor offenders.

The girl's mother, father and brother were also injured in the crash that is now being investigated by the Directorate of Professional Standard

The marked police car had its blue 
lights and siren on at the time of the collision in south east London, 
between New Cross and South Bermondsey.

The 13-year-old girl died at the scene, which is close to Millwall Football Stadium, from her injuries, police said.

The child’s mother, father and brother were also travelling in the car, and have been taken to hospital although their injuries are not thought serious at this time.

The London Ambulance Service (LAS) confirmed that a man in his 40s was treated for chest and abdominal injuries, and a young boy was treated for chest injuries. They were both taken to King’s College Hospital.

The LAS added that a woman in her 30s was treated for chest injuries and taken to Royal Free London.

The male driver of the Peugeot has 
been arrested and taken into custody. The female passenger has been 
taken to hospital suffering from minor injuries.

It is not clear how long the police car had been chasing the Peugeot before it crashed into a family's Volkswagen Polo in Ilderton Road in New Cross, south-east London, around 6.25pm on Sunday.

An investigation is underway into the circumstances surrounding the crash, particularly the role of the police pursuit.

It is understood it struck the rear of the VW Polo, sending it careering into a traffic light post.

Officers from the Directorate of Professional Standard, and Traffic officers, are investigating.

The
Independent Police Complaints Commission has also been informed and has
an investigator at the scene in the Southwark borough assessing the 
circumstances

They are assessing the circumstances to determine their level of involvement in the case, but have not opened an investigation, a spokesman said.

A police source said that the 13-year-old was believed to be of Eastern European origin.

Commander Tony Eastaugh said: ‘An innocent family are now dealing with the tragic loss of a loved one.

'The
Metropolitan Police has now begun a thorough investigation into the 
circumstances of this terrible incident. The thoughts of our staff and 
officers are with the family at this time.’

Speaking in the House of Commons, Home Secretary Theresa May said: 'Could I also extend my sympathies to the family of the 13-year-old girl who died following a traffic accident involving a police patrol car on Sunday night.'

Debris had been cleared and traffic 
was moving at the scene of the crash at a junction in Ilderton Road in 
south Bermondsey today.

Parents taking their children for the
start of term at nearby Ilderton Primary School spoke of their sadness 
and shock at the death of the 13-year-old.

Michelle Foster, 37, a nursery 
assistant, who had walked her nine-year-old to school, said: 'I am 
shocked - I heard the news from another mum as we were walking along to 
school. I feel very, very sorry for the family.'

Francis Soares, 52, a porter, who lives in Ilderton Road, said he arrived home last night shortly after the crash happened.

'There were police and ambulances and paramedics,' he said.

'It was dark and you could not see what was happening and the whole place was blocked off.

'I am very saddened to hear the news about the 13-year-old girl.'

Afza Osman, 37, a full-time mother 
who had dropped her five-year-old at Ilderton Primary School, said: 'It 
is very, very sad. We cross that road every single day.'

Internet users took to Twitter to express their shock at the tragic death.

‘A 13yo girl killed in new cross by a car being chased by police. Sad times,’ posed @djlilchris.

‘Mad collision in New Cross/Deptford earlier,’ added kimphamBITCH.

In 2011/2012 there were 18 car crashes involving police cars in which 18 men died.

The two youngest victims were aged 16.
