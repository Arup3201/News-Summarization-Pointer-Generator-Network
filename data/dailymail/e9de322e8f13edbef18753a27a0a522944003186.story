Waterskiing is a little different Down Under. 

This is an unusual moment when a man sets up a fold-up camping chair to his paddle board.

With a beer in one hand and holding a rope tightly with the other, the man is seated on his invention as he cruises by at high speed behind a speed boat at the Swan River in Perth, Western Australia.

The footage shows two male friends controlling the boat while the man, known as 'Sean' is casually enjoying a drink under the sun on what is believed to be a recent Sunday afternoon.

Sean and his friends took a relaxing getaway one weekend and visited the river to do some waterskiing and wakeboarding.

But he wanted to take things onto a whole new level, so he attaches a chair to his paddle board, and cracks opened a beer and casually drinks it.

As he skis along the water and comes close to the sands, he raises his beer up and screams 'woooo' at the amazed crowd, who are also heard in the background of the video.
