A 21-year-old has told how glamour modelling saved her from depression and gave her her life back.

Rosie Doherty, from Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire,  used to suffer from panic attacks, anxiety and OCD when she was in school, making her life a misery.

Her confidence plummeted and the situation became so bad that Rosie stopped attending classes.

But after she started modelling for lads' mags, Rosie shed more than just her clothes - she lost her anxiety too.

Ironically one of the strongest sources of teasing was her lack of a chest - with other girls bullying her for her slow development.

Rosie says: 'When I was 12, everyone else had boobs but me - girls used to laugh and call me 'AA'.

'It’s ironic really considering how things turned out.

'I suffered badly with depression - OCD, panic attacks and all sorts of things.

'I didn’t enjoy school at all - I had no self-confidence and didn’t want to see other people - in the end I just told my mum I wasn’t going.'

Despite not turning up very often, Rosie still did well in her GCSEs, but it wasn’t until she turned 18 that her confidence began to return.

Rosie boldly started her own career by approaching magazines with pictures she had taken herself

Rosie says she finds glamour modelling empowering and is proud to show off her body, flaws included

Following her 'feel the fear and do it anyway' motto, she took herself down to a promotional photo shoot.

Armed with the pictures, she built up her portfolio and started sending them to the lads' mags and soon found herself garnering attention from the industry.

She said: 'People say all these things about glamour modelling, but for me, it totally turned my life around.

Rosie says her father has now come to terms with her career choice

'A lot of that is to do with a feminist petition saying they were against it for objectifying, almost dehumanising, women.

'But for me it was absolutely the opposite. It was about female power, and taking a stand, and saying "this is me, this is who I am, this is my body”.

'Seeing myself in those magazines had a massive impact on my confidence - I finally felt like me again.'

However, her path into the industry hasn’t always been smooth, especially for her relationship with her father.

Rosie said: 'When I first started he wasn’t happy because I’m his little girl.

'But I spoke to him and said, "I’m a woman now, this is my choice, there’s nothing wrong with what I’m doing, and I want to be open and honest with my family”.

'Once we had that conversation he was happy with my decision.'

She’s quick to point out that she doesn’t do modelling for an ego trip and shies away from flashing her flesh on social media.

Rosie says it’s all about her transformation and her independence.

Defiant Rosie said: 'I’ve got imperfections, scars and cellulite, just like any other woman, and I’m still putting myself out there.

'I’m not scared of people’s opinions or judgments - for me it’s about independence, taking charge of your own life, and just being comfortable in your own skin.

'You’re always going to be judged, from the first moment you step out of the house until you return.

'If you’re happy and you feel good about the choices you make, then what else matters?'
