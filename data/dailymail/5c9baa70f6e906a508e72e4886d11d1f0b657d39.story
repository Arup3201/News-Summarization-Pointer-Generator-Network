A teenager has turned his grandmother into an internet sensation after posting dozens of pictures of her with household items balanced on her head.

Jamie Nokes, 18, started the Twitter page 'Things on my nan' as a joke between friends - and started posting pictures of his nan, Jean, with things balanced on her head.

But within weeks, the account had more than 40,000 followers.

Now, Nanna Jean Nokes has celebrated her 71st birthday by balancing a birthday card on her head.

Game for a laugh: Jean maintains the same expression and wears the same dressing gown for each picture

The site gained popularity as founder Jamie Nokes, 18, from Manchester, uploaded more hilarious snaps of her.

Jean maintains the same facial expression and wears the same dressing gown as she balances items such as an ironing board, a tin of paint and even a microwave on her head.

Jamie said: 'I was bored one afternoon and sent a photo to my mate. He thought it was funny so I put it online.

'Nan doesn't mind, she just thinks it's funny. She's not right in the head. It runs in the family.

'I never thought it would get so big. Now the Twitter account has nearly 40,000 followers. All you can do is laugh.'

The site has become so popular that Jean now gets recognised when out doing the supermarket shopping.

Jamie has even tried to get his grandad Charlie involved in the site, by photographing him sitting on his grandmother's shoulders.

Jamie said: 'I really wanted to do 'Grandad on my nan' but he wouldn't do it.

'He's happy to laugh at nan but won't get involved as well.

'I thought about doing "Things on my Mum" too but I don't think she'd let me.

'Some days nan's really up for it, but some days she won't have it. She thinks the moment has past but we get more followers every day.'
