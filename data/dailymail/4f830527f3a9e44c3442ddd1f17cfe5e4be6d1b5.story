A bear really did walk into Lonigan’s bar in Estes Park, Colorado on Thursday - a 300 pound black bear.

Surveillance footage caught the bear ambling in through a back door and walking ever closer to a room full of drinking patrons.

Oddly enough, none of them reacted.

No joke: A bear really did walk into a bar in Estes Park, Colorado last week and it was caught on camera

Bear? What bear? After the bear sauntered into a back door and toward a bar full of patrons at Lonigan's pub, nobody seemed to notice

‘I tried to holler, “Bear!” so people could hear me,’ local man Daniel Lyell told CBS Denver. ‘They were oblivious.’

Bears aren’t uncommon in Estes Park, which abuts Rocky Mountain National Park. But the beasts don’t often walk into bars.

Lyell, who estimates the bear was over 6 feet long, had followed the bear in from the street.

The 300 pound, 6-foot beast came in through a back door and looked around for a while, but seemed as uninterested as the oblivious patrons

He's got a tail: Daniel Lyell saw the bear enter the bar from the street and followed it inside

Initially, he caught it rummaging through a Dumpster behind the place.

Nobody
may have noticed the bear before it apparently became bored and walked 
out the way it came, but Lonigan’s owner David Callahan wouldn’t have 
been fazed one bit if he’d seen his unusual patron.

‘We are in the Rocky Mountains,’ he said. ‘It’s their territory not ours.’
