Casey Kasem, radio legend and host of 'American Top 40' for four decades, remains hospitalized in Washington state Sunday. The beloved radio personality is battling a infection stemming from a bedsore in addition to his myriad of other health problems.

Kasem, 82, was admitted to St Anthony Hospital in Gig Harbor, Washington, last week, where he has been receiving wound care, intravenous antibiotic 
therapy, blood pressure support medication and treatment for his pain, 
hospital spokesman Scott Thompson told Reuters.

'Right now, Casey Kasem’s health is declining and won’t be with us much longer,' said daughter Kerri Kasem in a family statement released on Friday.

The family has gathered at the hospital, and Kasem's wife, Jean Kasem, being allowed a private moment with her husband.

A Washington state judge ruled on Friday that Kasem's care would be decided by his daughter, Kerri, and not her stepmother Jean.

This ruling ended a protracted legal battle that was responsible for many highly publicized moments, such as the incident of May 13 where custody of Kasem was taken by Kerri from Jean at a home in Kitsap County, Washington.

In this incident, Jean tossed a package of ground meat at her stepdaughter, accusing her of '(giving) my husband to
the wild rabid dogs.'

Kasem suffers from Lewy body disease, a common form of dementia with symptoms similar to Parkinson's disease and hallucinations. It affects more than 1.3 million people in America alone.

The Kasem family said Friday that, despite the legal battle between Kerri and Jean, the family has come together.

'I want my Dad just once to see everyone standing around him, putting 
our differences aside and let him know how much he is loved by everyone,
 including Jean and Liberty.' said Kerri in a statement.

Liberty Kasem is Kasem's daughter from his marriage to Jean. Him and Jean, formerly known as TV actor Jean Thompson, were wed in 1980. She is his second wife.

In the family's statement, they said that they will not be doing any 
press until further notice. “Please respect their privacy at this 
difficult time,” it said.

This was also confirmed by Thompson, who said that 'any further updates on Mr. Kasem’s condition will be at the discretion and approval of his children.'

Kasem rose to fame as the recognizable voice of 'American Top 40,' also hosting a number of other countdown-style programs and performing the voice of Shaggy in the 
"Scooby-Doo" cartoons.

Kasem has four children, three with his previous wife Linda Myers and his fourth, Liberty Kasem, with Jean Kasem.
