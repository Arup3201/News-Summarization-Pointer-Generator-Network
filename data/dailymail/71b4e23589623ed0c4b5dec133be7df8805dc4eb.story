Her distraught family had gathered around her body to say their final farewells. 

Mother-of-four Tasleem Rafiq had suffered a heart attack and medics had not been able to revive her. 

Doctors warned that even if they could restart the 52-year-old’s heart, she would have suffered irreversible brain damage.

Unusual: Tasleem Rafiq's recovery has baffled doctors at the Royal Berkshire Hospital in Reading, who are describing it as 'a miracle,' according to her family

But just as her grieving children 
tried to come to terms with their loss, Mrs Rafiq apparently came back 
from the dead – and spoke to her stunned daughter.

And by the next morning, the patient was joking and chatting with her family as if nothing had happened.

Mrs Rafiq, who was diagnosed with  multiple sclerosis aged 32 and cannot walk, said she feels ‘very lucky’ to have survived. 

The grandmother, who did not want to 
 be pictured, added: ‘God will take  you when he chooses. Everyone was 
praying and God said: “I am going to leave this lady.” I am a very lucky
 mother.’ 

The ordeal began when Mrs Rafiq collapsed at her terraced family home in Reading. 

An ambulance was called and medics 
started trying to resuscitate her at home, continuing in the ambulance 
and at the accident and emergency department at Royal Berkshire 
Hospital. 

Mrs Rafiq’s son Fezaen, 28, claimed: 
‘We were waiting [in the A&E department] when the doctor came out 
and said: “I have to tell you that we have been trying to get your 
mother’s heart started for 45 minutes and we haven’t had any luck. 
Unfortunately she has died.”’

This was at 11.30am, he added, and the devastated family requested some private time with Mrs Rafiq’s body to say goodbye.

They were warned that, because their 
mother had been injected with adrenalin, her body would make involuntary
 movements which should not be mistaken for signs of life.

Fezaen said: ‘We were sitting with 
her, praying. I was on the right and my brother was on the left when he 
said, “She’s looking at you”. 

‘We called the nurse and asked if that was normal. She said yes, it was quite normal.’ 

But over the next two hours, this 
happened several more times. Eventually, a doctor examined Mrs Rafiq 
again, and confirmed that there was in fact a faint pulse. 

However, the family was warned that 
though she was clinging on to life, she would have suffered irreversible
 brain damage and was expected to die soon. Doctors also advised that if
 she had a second cardiac arrest, she should not be resuscitated.

Despite this, the family stayed by her bedside, praying for a miracle.
  At around 10pm, Mrs Rafiq’s daughter Shabana, who was sat holding her mother’s hand, thought she felt her pulling it away.

She said: ‘Mum, if I have done 
something to upset you, tell me.’ To her astonishment, Mrs Rafiq turned 
to her and replied: ‘What have you done to upset me?’ 

After collapsing on September 14, Mrs Rafiq was discharged and allowed to go home on October 2. 

Her family have claimed that  at the 
time, doctors described  her recovery as a ‘miracle’.  However, a 
spokesman for Royal Berkshire Hospital said that Mrs Rafiq had never 
officially been declared dead.

He added: ‘It was felt that she was 
unlikely to survive and it is very fortunate that she had not suffered 
brain damage but at no point was she dead. She had a very faint pulse 
which may have gone undetected.
  ‘Her recovery was unusual. Everyone is very pleased that she didn’t suffer any permanent damage.’ 

David Mossop, lead consultant in 
emergency care medicine at the hospital, said resuscitation protocol had
 been followed correctly.
  After Mrs Rafiq’s heart had stopped 
for 45 minutes, and with blood tests showing profound lack of oxygen, a 
severe amount of brain damage would be expected, he said. But Mrs Rafiq 
suffered no effects from her ordeal, other than some temporary memory 
loss.

Mrs Rafiq’s family are adamant that staff at the hospital had said that she had died.

Fezaen added: ‘It is not something we
 would mistake; they told us she was dead. But she is doing well now, 
there have been no lasting ill effects on her.’ 

Mrs Rafiq’s eldest son Yousif said: 
‘It was obviously very traumatic, the doctor had said she passed away so
 we started breaking the news to the rest of the family and relatives 
began making their way to the hospital.
  ‘But then she started to squeeze my sister’s hand... the doctor said it was a miracle.’

Diagnosing death can be an ‘inexact science’, according to Tony Calland, chairman of the British Medical Association’s medical ethics committee.He said: ‘Death is like appendicitis – it is one of the easiest and most difficult conditions to diagnose. You are always going to get bizarre cases.’

He added it was not unheard of for a pathologist to start a post-mortem examination ‘and then the patient swallows’.

There have been several cases around  the world of people being declared dead  by doctors – and then apparently coming back to life.

Earlier this year, mourners in Egypt cheered when the ‘dead’ body they were burying woke up. Hamdi Hafez al-Nubi, a 28-year-old waiter, had been declared dead after suffering a heart attack at work.

His body was being prepared for burial when another doctor, sent to sign his death certificate, discovered he was still warm and managed to revive him.

And in April a 95-year-old Chinese woman climbed out of her own coffin six days after she was declared dead following a fall.

Under Chinese tradition, Li Xiufeng was placed in a coffin kept in her house so friends and relatives could pay their respects. But the day before the funeral, neighbours found an empty coffin and later discovered her in the kitchen cooking.

In Tasleem Rafiq’s case, it appears that she had a pulse all along, but that it became so faint that it was undetectable.
