Police in Ontario had to call in officers from every division to break up a wild house party on Friday night, with 60 cop cars showing up to control the 2,000 people who turned up for the 'monster mansion party'.

The raucous Brampton hoedown was discovered by police on Twitter, where it was being promoted under the hashtag #MansionParty.

Officers had gone to the still-under-construction home on Stanley Carberry Dr. earlier in the night to warn the mother that her son's party was being touted on social media.

She said: 'I told my son he could have some friends over.'

'Quiet night with a few friends': Social media snaps show an estimated 2,000 packed into a sprawling home in Brampton, Ontario, on Friday night after it was promoted on social media

The home, which is thought to have been under construction for years, was 'trashed', according to one reveler, with an estimated $70,000 worth of damage

The police who broke up the party said there was a huge potential for problems, mostly likely the balcony and staircases collapsing under the weight of revelers

The 5,000-square-foot house has reportedly been under construction for several years

A neighbor who lives across the street from house said the son had informed them about the party on Friday morning.

'He told (us) that they were just going to have a small party,' he told CTV News.

But by 9.30pm, the house was completely over-run.

One reveler, who identified himself as Nick and said he was 16, said he heard about the party on social media and arrived to a line-up of about 200 cars and a tour bus packed with people.

'I have seen something like this in the movies, but never in real life,' he told The Record.

'There were hundreds of people here. Some people were climbing over ladders and smashing the windows. Some were drinking. Everyone wanted to get inside.'

Images posted on Twitter and Instagram show hundreds of people crammed onto the staircases of the sprawling mansion with scores more outside the home.

There were no injuries, but Ruttan said police laid a number of assault and public intoxication charges.

'There was a potential, a real potential for something to happen, something deadly,' Const. Thomas Ruttan told CTV Toronto.

According to one party-goer, the home was 'completely trashed'.

'There were a lot of broken windows,' he told CP24 on Saturday outside the home.

The estimated amount of damages was $70,000, according to The Record.

The 5,000-square-foot house has reportedly been under construction for several years.
