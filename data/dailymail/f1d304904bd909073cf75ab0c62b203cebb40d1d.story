The Detroit Tigers became the first baseball team to have three pitchers who have all won the coveted Cy Young Award after completing a blockbuster deadline day deal for David Price from Tampa Bay on Thursday.

Price joins Max Scherzer and Justin Verlander to complete the Tigers' collection of successive Cy Young award winners over the last three seasons.

The AL Central-leading Tigers are aiming for a fourth consecutive division title and now have one of the strongest set of pitchers to help reach that goal.

General manager Dave Dombrowski told the Associated Press: 'The question that we asked ourselves is: What gives us the best chance of winning the world championship this year?

'We thought adding him to our rotation at this point would give us the best chance to do that.''

'Today it’s great. I love to have David Price. If we win, then I’ll be very satisfied,' he added.

Price reacted onn Twitter: 'Wow...what a day!! Rays fans THANK YOU!! Great Chapter of my life just ended … ready to start a new one with the Tigers!! Thanks again.'

Price's move came after Tampa slipped well behind in the AL East race earlier this season and, despite coming into form over the last month, the Rays decided to cash in on their star.

The deal also involved the Seattle Mariners, who took Austin Jackson from Detroit while Tigers pitcher Drew Smyly and Mariners infielder Nick Franklin were sent to the Rays. A minor-league shortstop, Willy Adames, also swapped the Tigers for the Rays.

'Compared to the other possibilities, it was by far the most prudent thing that we could do for the best interests of the franchise,” said Andrew Friedman, Tampa Bay’s vice-president of baseball operations.

'If you look ahead to next year, it would have been really challenging to be as good as we want to be within our situation, with David taking up that meaningful of a percentage of our payroll. So everything we do is in the vein of how to be competitive in the near term and also the long term.'

The Tigers will use Price in rotation with Verlander, Scherzer, Anibal Sanchez and Rick Porcello.

Price, 28, leads the American League in innings and strikeouts. He is seventh in the league in WHIP. He is third in strikeouts per walk and fifth in strikeouts per nine innings.
