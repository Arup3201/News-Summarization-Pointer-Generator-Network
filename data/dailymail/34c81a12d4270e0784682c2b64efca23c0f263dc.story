Magician Penn Jillette says there's nothing magical about The Celebrity Apprentice or its creator, Donald Trump, ripping the tycoon who regularly Googles himself and 'desperately' cares what people think about him.

Jillette, known mostly for being half of the Penn and Teller entertainment act, appeared on Celebrity Apprentice twice.

In his tell-all book, Every Day Is an Atheist Holiday!, Jillette criticized reality television as a whole, but blasted Celebrity Apprentice as a program that 'has nothing to do with business.'

The mogul and the magician: Penn Jillette, right, has some not-so-kind words for Donald Trump, left in his latest book

Jillette writes: 'The secret truth of
The Celebrity Apprentice is that it isn’t very hard. The tasks are 
nothing. Makeup starts just after 5am and the show goes to about 10pm, 
but you spend most of that time doing nothing.'

He adds: 'The Celebrity Apprentice is junior high with a better brand of acne cover-up.'

Author: Every Day Is an Atheist Holiday is the latest of several books Jillette has written

An excerpt of the book was posted on Salon.com.

Jillette's criticism of Trump was also marked by what's on the famed real estate mogul's head.

'I wasn’t even going to say anything 
about Trump’s hair. I live in a glass house. I’ve always had ugly, 
out-of-style hair. Trump’s hair is a lot better than mine - but as I sat
there for hours half listening to Donald carry on, it struck me exactly
what his hair looked like.

'It looks like cotton candy made of p***. That revelation came to me, and I had to type it here. But my hair is worse.'

And Trump wasn’t the only target of Jillette’s writings. He also had something to say about Celebrity Apprentice co-star Clay Aiken.

He wrote: 'One day while shooting, I’d had a heart-to-heart talk with Clay Aiken. I would have preferred waterboarding. I don’t like heart-to-heart talks with anyone, but Clay Aiken? Strap me to the board, and put the wet towels over my face. Drowning sounds nice.'

As for Celebrity Apprentice, Jillette says the show has no rules - it's just Trump 'doing what he wants.'

'We’ve chosen to make this whackjob, with the cotton candy p*** hair and the birther s***, into someone we want to please.'

Trump, who is normally very active on Twitter, has not yet made any mention of Jillette’s book or a reaction to his claims.
