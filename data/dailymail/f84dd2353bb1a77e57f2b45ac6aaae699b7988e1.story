A former policeman who became a feared cartel boss has been arrested on suspicion of killing hundreds of people and dumping their bodies in mass graves.

Mario Nunez, also known as 'M-10', was a key figure in Mexico's long-running drug war, and was accused of involvement with the murder of 350 people in 2011.

Yesterday police in the northern state of Chihuahua detained the 39-year-old in the border city of Ciudad Juarez.

Nunez began working with the Juarez Cartel before joining the rival Sinaloa organsation led by Mexico's most-wanted man, Joaquin 'Shorty' Guzman.

The government partially blames Nunez for an upsurge in drug violence that brought shootouts in broad daylight, ambushes of police and kidnappings to Ciudad Juarez, which is just over the border from El Paso, Texas.

Court documents say Guzman hired Nunez and gave him the job of snatching the smuggling corridors into the U.S. from the local Juarez Cartel, through ordering gangs of hit men to carry out killings that included grisly mutilations and decapitations.

The Juarez Cartel lost ground to the Sinaloa organisation in a three-year battle that wound down in 2011.

But Nunez's criminal career continued, according to the authorities.

The Mexican government claims Nunez's power struggle with another drug boss in the spring of 2011 resulted in the killing of 350 people, whose bodies were unearthed in 23 mass graves in the state of Durango.

'Much of the violence seen in the states of Chihuahua and Durango is partially because of the actions carried out by this man,' a government spokesman said.

Nunez faces up to 40 years in prison if he is found guilty of the alleged offences.

He is also wanted in the U.S. on charges drug trafficking, although it is not known whether American authorities will try to extradite him.

Violence stemming from the actions of drug cartels reached a horrific peak during the presidency of Felipe Calderon, who vowed to crack down on the criminal gangs.

It has calmed down somewhat since he left office last year, but 1,000 people still die as a result of drug-related violence every month.
