Arsene Wenger insists Arsenal's unsettled German striker Lukas Podolski is not a player he is willing to sell.

Wenger claims Podolski is an important part of his squad although he has yet to start a game in the Barclays Premier League this season.

Inter Milan are thought to be interested in making a move when the transfer market opens in January but a three-match ban for Olivier Giroud, sent off against QPR, will not help.

'I don't give importance to rumours. There was a rumour in France a few days ago that I offered €62million to Paris for Edinson Cavani. Every day it's a different rumour. It's better you don't give importance to that.

'At a big club you have some players who don't play who are not happy. When players are happy when they don't play you have a problem. He will play. Tomas Rosicky was outstanding (against QPR) and he didn't play for a long time. He came prepared. Our job always to be ready when you play.'

Asked why Podolski did not come on against QPR and was seen standing by the tunnel looking glum, Wenger replied: 'He knows when we have to defend a result it was not his turn to come on. We needed to defend.'
