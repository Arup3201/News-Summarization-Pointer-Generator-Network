A deranged Detroit man stole his recently deceased 93-year-old father's body from the cemetery with the hopes of resurrecting the man through prayer, it was revealed today.

The body of Clarence Bright was found today stuffed inside a new freezer in his 48-year-old son's basement.

Mr Bright was taken in his casket from a mausoleum at Gethsemane Cemetery Monday morning. Witnesses reported seeing a white van pull up shortly before Mr Bright's body was removed.

Grave robbing: Here's the empty casket that cops found today in the back of a white van. The body of Clarence Bright was later found inside a freezer in his son's basement.

Police found the van parked at a Citgo gas station this morning, according to a local television report.

They found the empty casket inside and arrested the two men.

Mr Bright's son and a 38-year-old man, whose identity was not released, were taken into custody.

Their names and charges have not yet been released.

A short time later, police went to the son's home and found Mr Bright's body.

The son told family members that he took his father from the cemetery in order to bring him back to life, a source told the Detroit Free Press.

Mr Bright had his funeral Saturday but he wasn't buried yet because the ground was too wet.

Investigators initially searched the son's home on Monday but did not locate the body, the Free Press said.

Cemetery declined comment to the Free Press Monday.
