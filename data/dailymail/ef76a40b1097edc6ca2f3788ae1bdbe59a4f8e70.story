A journalist who hacked more than 1,000 voicemails was spared jail yesterday after he gave evidence against former Downing Street spin doctor Andy Coulson.

Dan Evans, 38, admitted hacking phones at the Sunday Mirror and the News of the World and said former tabloid editor Coulson sanctioned the hacking.

He was given a 10-month sentence for hacking some 200 celebrities and politicians, and for illegal payments to public officials and perverting the course of justice, but the sentence was suspended for a year.

Mr Justice Saunders said he was not sending Evans to prison because he had admitted his crimes and had agreed a deal with the Crown Prosecution Service to give evidence against others.

Evans was a witness during the recent trial in which Coulson, 46, was convicted and given an 18-month jail sentence for phone hacking.

Evans claimed he was recruited to the News of the World in 2005 to target the voicemail messages of celebrities and politicians and said the illegal hacking was so widespread that ‘even the office cat’ knew.

He admitted two charges of hacking and also confessed to paying a prison guard for information about Soham murderer Ian Huntley, and paying a policeman for details about EastEnders actor Steve McFadden.

The information included a tip that former school caretaker Huntley was an avid fan of BBC1 show Strictly Come Dancing, the Old Bailey heard.

Evans, a married father-of-two, also pleaded guilty to lying in a witness statement in a High Court case brought against the now defunct Sunday tabloid by interior designer Kelly Hoppen, in which he denied attempting to hack her phone in 2009.

Mr Justice Saunders ordered Evans to complete 200 hours of unpaid community service and but said he would spare him a prison sentence.

He said: ‘In the circumstances of this case and in particular the co-operation that Mr Evans has given and has agreed to give the police and the prosecution in the future, as compared with the lack of co-operation of others, I do feel able to suspend the sentence.’

In a separate case, a chauffeur and three security guards who worked for News International were cleared of an alleged cover-up over the phone hacking scandal.

The four men were accused of conspiring with Rebekah Brooks and her husband Charlie to pervert the course of justice – a charge which Mr and Mrs Brooks were acquitted of at their trial.

The CPS said it would offer no evidence against the men and they were formally acquitted, after spending more than two years on bail.
