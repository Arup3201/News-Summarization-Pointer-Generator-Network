A wartime RAF station control tower is to be converted into a bed and breakfast.

The plan to transform the old Second World War building in Norfolk is the brainchild of Nigel Morter and his wife Claire Nugent.

The Control Tower was built to command all the North Creake Airfield take-offs and landings during World War Two.

After the war it became offices, a workers' mess room and flats, before spending the last 20 years as a home.

Back in time: The idea to transform the old Second World War tower in Norfolk is the brainchild of Nigel Morter and his wife Claire Nugent

Nod to the past: The husband-and-wife team believe their transformation that will not only salute the tower's heritage but share the story of its part in Hitler's downfall

The husband-and-wife team believe their transformation that will not only salute the 
tower's heritage but share the story of its part in Hitler's downfall 
with a present-day generation.

'It is the world coming together for us, everything we wanted,' said Nigel Morter university academic, Nigel Morter, who bought the property and moved in with Claire in October 2011.

The couple who have one son, insist they are not modernising the place 'rather, they're taking it back in time.'

Labour of love: The couple are creating a lounge - originally the air station's meteorological and teleprinter room - resplendent with 1930s furnishings

Pieces of history: Claire found some of Bomber Command's chaff - originally called Window by the British, are tiny strips of tinfoil and were dropped by Allied bombers to 'chaff' to jam enemy radar

North Creake Airfield opened on November 23 1943.

Seventeen aircraft were lost during operations from the airfield, eight Stirling and nine Halifax.

Although proposed as a Very Heavy Bomber airfield for future advanced aircraft these plans were dropped in the spring of 1944. 

The airfield’s isolated location, however, made it perfect for the radio countermeasures work and bomber support carried out by squadrons of the RAF’s new No 100 Group.

In May 1944 No 199 Squadron flew Short Stirlings to confuse enemy radars by using ‘Mandrel’ jamming equipment which proved vital to the bomber offensive.

On D-Day the squadron played a crucial role by simulating a large collection of ships heading towards the Pas-de-Calais area, so drawing enemy forces away from the actual Allied invasion area in Normandy. 

The simulation was achieved through the flying formation which gave the impression of a large convoy, showing up as huge ships on enemy radar screens.

‘C’ Flight of No 199 Squadron was detached to form the nucleus of No 171 Squadron in September 1944, mainly using Handley Page Halifaxes for yet more countermeasures operations, also dropping ‘Window’ tin foil strips to jam enemy radar.

The airfield was later used by No 274 Maintenance Unit to store and then scrap many de Havilland Mosquitoes until closure in September 1947.

'We want to respect it as a building and protect the authenticity of its history,' said Nigel.

They
plan to offer Bed and Breakfast with three en suite rooms and have a 
tea garden in the grounds around the building with seating in the air 
raid shelter.

By next summer they hope the work will be complete and they will be able show guests to their rooms in the
old signal office or controller's rest room.

The couple are creating a lounge - 
originally the air station's meteorological and teleprinter room - 
resplendent with 1930s furnishings.

The bathrooms will be 
art deco, and guests will be able to choose what to have for breakfast on Ministry of 
Food-style menus and read daily postings of the RAF station's operations
schedules as they were in the days of 1944-45.

But at the moment the couple are living in chaos   with wallpaper partly torn off 
walls, half-finished floors, paint jobs waiting to be finished and piles
of clutter.

'At the moment, it's at its worst,' said Nigel. 

But Claire said: 'We are really fired up for the whole thing. We've got well used by now to the cold and the grit and the dust all over the place.'

Corroded and weathered railings surround the balcony from where airmen once gazed out across yawning runways, awaiting the return of crews of Stirling and Halifax aircraft from their special missions to confuse Hitler's Luftwaffe.

Nigel, who works at London 
Metropolitan University, grew up in an aviation-orientated family - both
his grandad and dad had worked for De Havilland, the latter on 
Mosquitos.

They couple plan to remove the post-war alterations - shingles, its pitched
roof, various sheds from the woodyard days.

Even its contemporary kitchen will go eventually, to be replaced by a 1950s-style version with metal and Formica fittings.

While they were clearing out, Claire found some of Bomber Command's chaff under the concrete 
yard.

History: An old air raid shelter on the land which could hold 50 people at a squeeze

Chaff, originally 
called Window by the British, are tiny strips of tinfoil and were 
dropped by Allied bombers to 'chaff' to jam enemy radar.

It could also be used to signal distress
by an aircraft when communications are not functional - it has the same
effect as an SOS, and can be picked up on radar when it is dropped 
every two minutes.

The steps to the upper floor have been re-fabricated and the
brick walls will have a smooth, authentic rendering once again and 
those observation balcony rails will be restored as well as they can be.

'Anything
that isn't skilled labour, we are trying to do ourselves,' said Nigel, 
whose grounds maintenance skills from his past career are coming in 
handy with the landscaping.

The isolated farmland setting, fringed by the Holkham Estate, was used first as a decoy site by the air force.

But then building work started on a heavy 
bomber base, called RAF North Creake 
complete with three intersecting runways, a control tower, technical and
administration sites and quarters for more than 3,000 servicemen and 
women.

In due course, 
100 Group of RAF Bomber Command used the station to employ 
counter-measures to disrupt the Nazis' electronic and radio 
communications.

In peacetime, Mosquito planes - the wooden wonders - were stored there for a while but the runways were largely broken up.

Some aerodrome buildings survived, though, to become civilian homes, a woodyard, part of a feed mill and agricultural sheds
