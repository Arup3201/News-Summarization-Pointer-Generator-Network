Accused: Footballer Ravel Morrison is to go on trial next year over claims that he threatened to throw acid in his ex-girlfriend's face and have her killed

Premier League footballer Ravel Morrison is to go on trial next year over claims that he threatened to throw acid in his ex-girlfriend's face and have her killed.

The 21-year-old West Ham midfielder is also accused of threatening to blow up Reah Mansoor's house during a four-year campaign of harassment against her.

Morrison, who started his career at Manchester United, is also alleged to have assaulted the 19-year-old and her mother, Parveen Mansoor, 39, in Salford in the early hours of July 27.

During a brief appearance at Manchester Crown Court today, Morrison entered not guilty pleas to two counts of assault of beating, one of assault causing actual bodily harm and one count of harassment.

He was told that he would next appear for a case management hearing on November 10, with a provisional trial date set for January 26.

Morrison, originally from Manchester, was initially remanded in custody last week before being bailed.

His bail conditions are that he lives at an address in east London and does not contact either Miss Mansoor or her mother.

He is also prevented from entering the Greater Manchester area except for a court appearance or for a West Ham game, in which case he must return to London immediately after the match.

Despite being touted as a bright prospect at Old Trafford, Morrison appeared only in the League Cup before former Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson sold him to West Ham for £650,000 in January 2012.

West Ham manager Sam Allardyce took him to Upton Park but he was later shipped out on loan to Birmingham and QPR.

He featured for the Hammers in Tuesday's Capital One Cup match against Sheffield United, with his team eventually going out after losing 5-4 on penalties. 

Morrison picked up the first of his four England Under-21 caps in a 4-0 win over San Marino in October.
