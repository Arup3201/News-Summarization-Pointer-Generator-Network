Choosing a Valentine's Day gift is always a fraught affair - but it looks like it might just be about to get easier.

While most men could be forgiven for assuming that their other halves want to be spoilt with jewellery come Thursday, a new survey has revealed that all women really want for Valentine's Day is a hug.

Given the choice, nine in ten women would choose a thoughtful, romantic gesture over a luxury gift of diamonds.

Hug me tender: For most women, a big cuddle is at the top of their Valentine's Day wishlist

While many men believe jewellery and lingerie is the way to a woman's heart, most women would be happy with something that costs nothing such as a loving cuddle or a handwritten poem.The study found that a quarter of women would like their partner to write them a romantic poem, while eight per cent are hoping for a passionate embrace.

But not every woman will be satisfied with a humble hug. A quarter of the female respondents to the British Heart Foundation survey revealed they would love to be whisked away for a luxury trip abroad this Valentine's Day.

BHF Retail Director, Mike Taylor, said: 
'This survey shows you don't have to spend large sums of money to woo 
your other half this Valentine's Day.

'In fact, romantic gestures like writing a love note or even just a hug can make your partner's day.'

The research was carried out as part of the British Heart Foundation's annual Love Notes fundraising campaign.

Celebrities including Joey Essex, Mollie King, Mary Berry, Rick Parfitt, Fern Britton and Phil Vickery have all posted their Love Notes messages in BHF Shops.

But although male A-listers seemed to understand the power of a romantic gesture - step forward Joey Essex - real men haven't quite gotten there yet.

According to the survey, one in ten believe that cooking dinner is the way to a woman's heart, while a similar number thought that expensive jewellery or a day out shopping were guaranteed brownie point bankers.

Nearly one in ten men (nine per cent) believe lingerie is the best gift, despite the fact that just one per cent of women agree.

Interestingly, five per cent think that doing the housework is the most romantic gesture they could possibly make, while another two per cent astonishingly thought that not watching sport all weekend would do the trick for their other half.

He's not known for his erudite wit or expert grasp of grammar but at least Joey Essex does know how to write a love letter from the heart.

His short note might be brief but it doesn't look like girlfriend Sam Faiers will complaining anytime soon.

King, meanwhile, addresses hers to her beloved dog, Alfie.

The British Heart Foundation's Love Note campaign takes place each February as part of Heart Month.

For £1, you can buy a BHF love note and write your message on it before it's displayed in the windows of one of the charity's shops.

Money raised goes towards research on heart disease and helps support other work done by the BHF. For more information about the campaign, visit the British Heart Foundation website.
