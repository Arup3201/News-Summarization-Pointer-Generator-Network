All young people should visit not just British war graves but German ones too to ensure that they understand 'where we come from', War Horse author Michael Morpurgo has said.

The best-selling writer and former children's laureate also suggested that children need to be told personal stories about historical events such as the First World War because these are often too big for them to comprehend.

Speaking today at a conference for schools on how to mark the centenary of the Great War, Mr Morpurgo said stories are able to get through to people in a way that history books are unable to do.

At the same event, broadcaster Jeremy Paxman suggested people today lack the same 'sense of duty' that drove young men and women to fight in the First World War.

Mr Morpurgo told delegates he wanted to inspire and alert young minds to what happened during the war because it was 'the critical moment of our times, it was the cusp of history'.

'I think it should be, I won’t say obligatory, but the minister of education in me says obligatory, for every child to go there and stand there and look at those graves, but not just our graves, to go to the German graves where actually they don’t go,' he said.

'Because they were sons and fathers just as our boys were. So I think that’s important because we are living in this world where we travel, we are European, we feel together with these people but it is important for us to know where we come from.'

He also said that fiction and stories can teach people about different topics.

'Of course history has to be the basis of it, that’s absolutely the case, but it is the case also that the records that are left behind, that is the diaries, the letters home, those voices which speak from the heart, from the front to those who are loved at home, or simply jotted down, or the poems that they wrote, they have a way of getting through to us as a history book might not be able to do.'

He added: 'What I’ve tried to do all my writing life and all my teaching life is to bring stories to children. And I think the critical thing about making stories that work for children is that the children have to somehow feel the reality of the story.'

Mr Morpurgo said that teachers can stand in front of pupils and tell them about a major moment in history - such as the atrocity of the Holocaust.

'It’s all huge, it’s all too massive to comprehend such suffering and anyway for them, it was then, so whilst they might write an essay about it and somehow you’ve told them that story, you haven’t touched them, and you and I all know the way to touch them - they read Anne Frank.

'They go there and they know it then, and they care about it because they care about one person.'

In a written statement for the 
conference, organised by Wellington College and Wellington Academy, 
David Cameron said that children must be taught to understand the 
significance of the First World War and the debt owed to the generation 
who fought in it.

The Prime Minister insisted that pupils must learn why war broke out, what it was like for those involved and how the conflict helped to shape modern society.

And he suggested that schools should not 'shy away' from teaching pupils about the realities of the conflict.

He said that this year’s centenary will be a 'hugely important national moment' which will bring people together to reflect on the sacrifices made by many men and women.

'I want to put children at the front and centre of those commemorations, so that they too understand the significance of the conflict and the debt we owe that generation.'

The Prime Minister said pupils need to learn why 
war broke out, and how 'political alliances and rivalries' could have 
such an impact on the lives of people around the world.

He added: 'Visiting the sites where it took place is a sobering reminder of those realities.

'Seeing
 the thousands of names that cover the memorials, the row upon row of 
headstones, brings to life the scale of the sacrifice.'

As
 many people as possible should visit the battlefields, which is why the
 Government is giving two pupils and one teacher from every state 
secondary school the chance to go to the Western Front, Mr Cameron said.

Paxman: Young lack 'sense of duty' and focus on 'personal pleasure'

People today lack the same 'sense of duty' that drove young people to fight in the First World War, according to Jeremy Paxman.

Modern life is all about the 'pursuit of personal pleasure', a concept that would have been alien to young people during the Great War, the broadcaster suggested.

Speaking at a conference for schools on 
the War, Mr Paxman said that this attitude is one of the reasons he 
believes such a conflict will not happen in the future.

'There was what is notably absent now - another thing that I think makes this sort of conflict unimaginable in the future - there was a sense of duty,' he said.

'If you consider the way we lead our lives now, we lead our lives essentially in an atomised fashion, pursing personal pleasure.

'It’s all about personal choice; do what you want, please yourself.

'This was a world that was unknown to young people in 1914, 1915, 1916.'
