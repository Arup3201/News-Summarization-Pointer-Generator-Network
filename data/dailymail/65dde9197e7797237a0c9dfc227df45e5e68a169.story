Indiana University Parker Mantell didn't let his stutter stop him from making an inspirational graduation speech

A
 magnetic Indiana University senior with a stutter didn't let his 
disability stop him from making an inspired graduation speech 
encouraging his peers to achieve the very things they doubt the most.

'As a person who stutters, I can be no more certain that, in this room and in this hall, there are thousands of people who are far more talented at public speaking than I am,' began Parker Mantell in his May 10th commencement address to 17,000 people at Indiana University in Bloomington. Parker continued by making the crucial point that 'doubt, as has been observed, kills more dreams than failure.'

The cure to doubt? 'Confidence,' says Mantell, who after posting a video of his commencement address on Youtube has become a viral sensation with over 200,000 views.'Beethoven was deaf; imagine if he had never dared to listen to his calling to compose music, ' Mantell asked his graduating class as he urged them to go after their wildest dreams.

He went on to list some of the world's greatest artists, thinkers, and politicians who reached success despite having what others may consider a weakness.

'Ray Charles was blind; imagine if he had never dared to envision that he could touch the keys of a piano,' he said.

'Albert Einstein was dyslexic; imagine if he had never dared to embrace seeing things differently by formulating equations,' Mantell spoke as he exemplified the power of creative solutions.

'FDR couldn't walk; imagine if he had never dared to run,' added Mantell.

Parker Mantell's commencement speech to the graduating class of Indiana University was inspiring to many who want to achieve greatness despite what others may consider weknesses

'Imagine what you are depriving our world of if you never dare to achieve your purpose,' he told those about to face post-collegiate life, riddled with 'poison doubt' and criticism.

Parker thanked Indiana University for giving him the knowledge, power, and confidence to answer and make phone calls for various politicians and to gain competitive internships with FOX News and the US House Committee on Homeland Security despite his stutter.

Mantell said that whether a person has a speech impediment, ADHD, or simply has people telling them they cannot achieve something, they should stop giving other people power by doubting the power of their own unique abilities.

He challenged students to believe in themselves, leap at opportunities, and 'take a step forward.'

'I challenge you to take that step forward not despite your disabilities, your hurdles, or your hesitancies, but because of them.'

He concluded by taking a quotation from President Kennedy who said that people should go after their dreams not because it would be easy, but because 'it would be hard.'

Mantell, who graduated with a degree in political science and a minor in public management, wants to pursue a career in public service, reports AOL.

Parker Mantell may have a stutter but he also has a message, a message heard around the world.
