Coloured diamonds have been growing in popularity over the last few years, with more women choosing pink, black, yellow, chocolate, grey and even blue jewels as their engagement ring stone.

Celebrities including Jennifer Lopez, Mariah Carey, Heidi Klum, Katy Perry and even Sarah Jessica Parker's character Carrie from Sex And The City have worn coloured diamond engagement rings.

And that trend is due to rocket even more since singer Kelly Clarkson tweeted a photograph of the canary yellow rock given to her by new fiance Brandon Blackstock on Friday.

The 30-year-old star - who shot to 
fame after winning 'American Idol' in 2002 - shared her joy with her 
fans on the social networking site, writing: 'I'm engaged!!!! I wanted y'all to know!! 
Happiest night of my life last! I am so lucky and am with the greatest 
man ever.'

To cope with the new demand for coloured diamonds, British jewellers Ernest Jones have expanded their collection to include a selection of shades.

A spokesman said: 'Ernest Jones has expanded due to customer feedback to include black, chocolate, lemon, rosé, grey and now even blue diamond hues.

Classic: Ernest Jones' most popular coloured diamond engagement ring is the 8ct two colour gold 0.56 carat lemon diamond solitaire ring (£3799)

'Sales have seen double digit increases -
specifically by over 30 per cent on chocolate diamonds and over 50% on 
our lemon and rosé engagement and wedding lines since last year - and 
the collections have increased by over a third in terms of numbers of 
designs since last year, to keep up with customer demand.'

According to sales figures from the company, women in the south of England are most likely to opt for a coloured stone, and they tend to prefer blue, black, yellow and rosé.

Overall Ernest Jones Oxford Street is currently the store where the most rainbow rocks are flying off the shelves.

Yellow diamonds are the number one choice on the coloured spectrum overall - with the most popular design being the simple, classic, 18ct two colour gold 0.56 carat lemon diamond solitaire ring (£3799).

But women in the north of England prefer darker shades, with the Ernest Jones branch in Trafford selling the most amount of chocolate diamonds in the country.

Ernest Jones believe the trend for coloured diamonds comes from celebrities who are attracted by their rarity.
