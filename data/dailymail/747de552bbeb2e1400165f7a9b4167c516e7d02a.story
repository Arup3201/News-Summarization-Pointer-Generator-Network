In court: Melanie Jane Smith appeared at Prestatyn Magistrates today charged with four counts of murder

A 42-year-old woman appeared in court today charged with the murders of a young mother and three children who were killed in a house fire.

Mother Lee-Anna Shiers, 20, her 15-months-old son Charlie Timbrell, her niece Skye Allen, aged two, and nephew Bailey Allen, four, all perished after a first-floor flat in Prestatyn, North Wales, was engulfed by flames earlier this month.

Melanie Jane Smith today was charged with their murders and remanded in custody by magistrates at Prestatyn, North Wales, to appear before Mold crown court tomorrow.

Blonde Smith, wearing a white jumper 
with a cross pattern, was also accused of arson with intent to endanger 
life and threats to commit criminal damage by arson.

Defence solicitor Chris Dawson said: 'She
denies absolutely being responsible for the fire at her home address in
Maes y Groes which sadly led to the death of four people from the 
upstairs flat.

'She answered each and every question put to her by the 
police.

'She maintained her innocence.

'The charges will be contested at the crown court.'

Last week the devastated parents of Bailey and Skye said the family's world was " overturned" by the tragedy on October 19.

Steve Allen and his fiancee Jonty Lewis said: 'They were our world.

'Bailey with his cheeky smile and Skye was just beautiful. They were the most amazing kids in the world. Their smiles used to light up our day.

'They were such little stars. They were always so happy, they were a joy and loved everything about life.'

Family tributes were also paid to Lee-AnnaÂ  who was described as 'a kind, loving and caring person'.

Neighbours have previously described their horror as flames ripped through the first floor flat where the family were staying.

Inquests on the four victims were opened and adjourned. All of them died from burns and smoke inhalation.
