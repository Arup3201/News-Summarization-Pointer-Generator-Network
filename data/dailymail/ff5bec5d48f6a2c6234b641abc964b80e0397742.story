Australian Jason Day played one of the holes of the tournament on Saturday at the US PGA Championship, after wading through a river to find his ball.

Day, who is playing in the final pairing with leader Rory McIlroy, misplaced his tee shot on the second hole, leaving him the wrong side of a water hazard.

But the Australian showed he didn't mind getting his hands, and feet, dirty, rolling up his trousers and playing the shot barefoot.

Getting his feet wet: Day crosses the river in search of his ball at the second

Searching: Day tries to identify his ball amongst the heavy rough on the other side of the river

Catch: The Australian's caddy lobs a club over the river 

The 26-year-old crossed the river without a club, and had to have his caddy throw his iron across.

In the most remarkable par you are ever likely to see, Day skidded his recovery shot across the fairway before chipping to the green and sinking a put to stay eight under par.

Catching practice: Day, who is currently tied for second place, catches his club and returns to the ball

Shoeless wonder: After playing his shot Day returned to the course, put on his shoes, and made par
