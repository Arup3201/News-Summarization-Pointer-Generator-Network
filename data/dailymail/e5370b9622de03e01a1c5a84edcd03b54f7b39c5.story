Washington Redskins running back Alfred Morris' pride and joy isn't a sports car, a Hummer or a Cadillac - it's a 1991 Mazda 626, which until recently had no air-con and a large dent in the back right panel.

The NFL star certainly makes enough money to afford a brand-new car, but Morris has no interest in other vehicles.

'I didn’t grow up with a lot. This helps me remember where I come from and where I’m going,' he says.

The Bentley: Morris' beloved 1991 Mazda 626 is back to her best after a refurb

First love: Morris says he doesn't see why he should buy a new car when his old one is still running

Since Alfred Morris is an NFL player 
on an NFL salary, the question must be asked: why the attachment to a 
small sedan that's more than 20 years old?

Morris purchased the car from his pastor while he was a student at Florida State University for the sum of $2.

And while he could be getting around in something a little more lavish, Morris only has eyes for his first love.

'It’s more than just a car,' Morris, who started as a rookie with the Washington, DC, team last year, told Jalopnik.

Refreshingly, Morris doesn't have any desire to acquire status symbols, despite his success on-field.

'I'm loyal to my car,' he said, explaining that he doesn't feel the need
 to show off his money with expensive cars and clothing.

'I love my car, and that's what I'm 
going to drive. I'm a lot better off than I was but at the same time... I
 feel like it's a waste of money to go buy a new car if my car is 
running perfectly fine, you know? I just don't get that concept,' he 
told WUSA-TV.

Good as new: Morris will now enjoy air-conditioning in his Mazda 626

Pro: Morris is running back for the Washington Redskins

The car, which Morris refers to as 
'the Bentley,' recently underwent a complete overhaul to keep it up and 
running for another 20 years.

After hearing about Morris' love for his car, Mazda offered to refurbish the Bentley, 
which had broken air-conditioning and was in need of some TLC.

Morris was separated from his car as it underwent a total of 275 man hours of labor and received more that 450 new parts.

Mazda sent him regular updates on the progress, although sometimes he found it all a little much.

'I was like, "Oh, wow.’ I didn’t know they were gonna go that deep,' Morris told the Washington Post.

'It was weird seeing her like that. I was like, "No! They took her apart!" It hurt, just a little bit.'

At the big reveal on Tuesday at the Chantilly Mazda dealership, Morris was eager to see how his trusty car scrubbed up.

'She hasn’t changed,' he told the Washington Post.

'I
 mean, she looks different, but it’s still the same car. It a feel 
thing. Sometimes when something changes, you’re like, "Oh man, I want it
 the old way." But when I sat in her, I still got that feeling. She’s 
still the Bentley.'

Loyal: Morris has been driving the car since his college days when he bought it from his pastor for $2

The Bentley looked as good as when she was first driven off the lot in 1991. On the outside, the car had been completely repainted and new headlights and taillights were installed.

According to Jalopnik, the car received new 626 emblems and Mazda created some new exterior trim pieces using the original molds in Japan.

A dent on the back right side was panel-beaten out, despite some misgiving from Morris.

'The character, the dent that was in the back right side. I had the option to keep it, but then I called them and was like, "Don’t worry about it." All the hard work that they put into it, I think it would have took away from it if it still had the dent in the side. So I was like, I won’t be selfish. I’ll just keep the memory in my mind and said they could take it out.'

Mazda man: With help from the Mazda team, Morris and his ride have many more years together to look forward to

Mazda technicians removed the powertrain, rebuilt the 2.2-liter, 110 horsepower four-cylinder engine, installed new hoses, gaskets and rubber items, put in a new air conditioner, added new brakes front and rear, put on a new exhaust system, and even replaced the battery and alternator.

'It’s old school, like I am,' Morris said at the reveal, according to Jalopnik. 'I know I haven’t been around long, but I have an old spirit.'

There are a few new-school features that Mazda has added to the new and improved Bentley, including Bentley-style cross-stitched leather seats in homage to the car's namesake, and a new dashboard and a seven-inch touchscreen Pioneer stereo with Bluetooth.

'Man, I got my baby back, and she looks better than ever,' Morris said Tuesday.

'I just want to ride around and go nowhere in her. I’ll bet she’s been missing it.'
