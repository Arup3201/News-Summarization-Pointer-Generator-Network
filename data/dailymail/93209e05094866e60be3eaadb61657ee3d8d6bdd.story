A keen horsewoman died after being crushed by a ‘precariously balanced’ hay bale just months after warning about the dangers at a livery stable, an inquest heard today.

Charlotte Louise Conroy-Taylor, was killed when the giant hay bale weighing a ton fell on her at the stables where she kept her daughter Zara’s horse, Flash.

Mrs Conroy-Taylor had kept the horse at Beaumont Grange Farm, which has an equestrian centre with a riding school, for several years.

But tragedy struck in May last year when Mrs Conroy-Taylor, 45, went to the stables to help ‘muck out’ Zara’s horse after returning from a family holiday.

Crushed: Charlotte Conroy-Taylor was killed by a one-ton hay bale only months after warning of the risk of such an incident, an inquest has heard

An inquest into her death at Preston Coroner’s Court was told that Mrs Conroy-Taylor died almost instantly after being struck by the hay bale covered in black plastic.

Giving evidence 13-year-old Zara told how her mother had warned of an accident occurring with the hay bales prior to her death.

She said: ‘A few months before the accident my mum said "I bet one day one of them is going to fall" because she wasn’t as happy as she should have been with the way that they were stacked.

The girl said she went to the stables with her mother every evening at around 5pm.

Mrs Conroy-Taylor, Youth Offending Team manager at Lancashire County Council, would begin mucking out duties whilst Zara rode her horse around the stables.

Zara said her mother suffered from a bad back causing her to ‘hunch over’ meaning she preferred to get hay from a trough within the stables rather than access the bales.

However, on a number of occasions clients were forced to access the hay bales as the trough ‘was more often than not empty’.

She said: ‘We never opened a bale at the bottom of the stack and would know not to open one supporting the stack. It would make it unstable or fall it was common sense.’

On May 31 last year, the last time Zara saw her mother alive was as she stood next to a stack of hay bales around five metres high.

Preston and West Lancashire Coroner, James Adeley said: ‘Zara went to muck out the horse and Charlotte went to collect some hay.

‘But after her mother left Zara heard a scream a few moments later and found her mother on the floor with a hay bale near her feet and another by her side.

‘Zara called for help but Charlotte had already succumbed to her death.’

Zara held her mother’s hand and squeezed it but Mrs Conroy-Taylor did not respond, the court heard.

Emergency services were called to the farm in Morecambe but Mrs Conroy-Taylor, who lived with her husband Ian at Brookhouse, near Lancaster, was pronounced dead later the same day.

Four days after Mrs Conroy-Taylor’s death the farm in Bottomdale Road, Slyne, was visited by a number of health and safety experts.

Peter Lord, an environmental health officer for Lancaster City Council, told the jury he found an almost empty plastic wrapper at the bottom of the hay bale stack.

He said: ‘This empty wrapper was obviously a full bale at one time but hay had been taken from it on a regular basis and this had caused instability in the stack above.

‘The stack was precariously balanced and as the bale below got emptier it provided less support, causing it to collapse.’

Mr Lord said stable owner Carol Hill claimed that she had repeatedly tried to stop clients from accessing hay bales.

He said: ‘She told me she was red hot about this and told them regularly not to do it and to prevent it she had purchased a large wheeled trough which she kept stacked up with hay.’

'The stack was precariously balanced and as the bale below got emptier it provided less support, causing it to collapse'

Mrs Hill who runs the equine centre with her husband, Steve, told inspectors on the day of the accident the trough had contained hay.

However, Detective Sergeant Colin Forsyth from Lancaster CID said that during his inspection of the site the day after Mrs Conroy-Taylor’s death the trough was ‘completely empty.’

Michael Mullen from the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) said he became ‘very concerned’ about the safety of the stack during a visit to the farm following the incident.

He said: ‘We were reluctant to leave the centre because we thought the stacking at the stables was unsafe.

‘The front and back stack was not tied together and they were free standing. We had concerns about the structural integrity of the stack.’

Peter Hamer, agricultural expert at the HSE, told the court he had major concerns after he found the stack ‘dangerously’ leaning towards one side.

He ordered the couple to reassemble the stack immediately as clients including children were still using the stables.

He said: ‘We were not prepared to leave the site until the stack had been made safe.

‘It was a major concern as the stack was not tied together and the left hand row was leaning over.’

Pathologist Nicholas Mapstone told the court that Mrs Conroy-Taylor had died from multiple injuries including collapsed lungs and internal bleeding caused by the weight of the hay bale.
