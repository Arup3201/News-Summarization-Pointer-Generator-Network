An airport security worker has been suspended after she failed to spot a fake bomb designed to look like explosives as it passed through the X-ray machine.

The guard did not detect the dummy explosive as it passed through Manchester Airport’s ‘air side’ meaning it could have been taken on board a flight by a passenger.

It is believed that the woman missed the fake bomb because she was looking at her work rota at the time rather than watching the screen.

The airport confirmed that a female security officer had been suspended and an investigation launched into the incident which happened last Thursday.

The fake device was carried through security in an item of hand luggage by an official posing as a passenger, sent into the airport by the Department for Transport. 

'Secret shoppers': The Department of Transport do covert tests where officials pose as ordinary passengers to inspect security

The DfT carries out covert tests of 
security procedures at all UK airports with officials acting as ‘secret 
shoppers’, posing as ordinary passengers or even cabin crew members to 
inspect security.

A spokesman for the Department for Transport said: ‘The safety of the travelling public is paramount, which is why the UK combines intelligence, technology and other measures to provide one of the strictest regimes for aviation security in the world. 

‘We have a regular programme of inspections to ensure compliance with this regime, but do not comment on the specifics or outcomes for obvious reasons.’

The blunder comes after an 11-year-old who managed to sneak onto a plane without a ticket or passport and fly to Italy said it was 'easier than doing my homework.'

Liam Corcoran slipped away from his mother in Wythenshawe, caught a bus to the airport three miles away and boarded a Jet2.com plane bound for Rome without anyone, including security staff, questioning what he was doing. He also did not have a passport, boarding pass or cash.

It was not until Liam began boasting that he had run away from home as the plane cruised over France that other passengers alerted cabin crew. By then too late to turn around so the flight continued its journey to Rome.

Liam stayed in the airport with police and airline staff for nearly two hours before being put on a flight home.

Five members of Jet2.com staff were suspended.
