A six-month-old girl dices with death every nap time - because of a rare condition that means she stops breathing every time she falls asleep.

Jovie Wyse has to spend 21 hours a day on a special ventilator to keep her alive in case she nods off.

She had a tracheotomy just two months after she was born in May in a bid to save her life - and now she has finally been allowed to go home for the first time.

Jovie will need to rely on a ventilator (pictured) when she sleeps for the rest of her life

Jovie was diagnosed with congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS) - also known as Ondine's curse - meaning her body doesn't breathe automatically when she is asleep.

Her parents, Chris and Lorna Wyse, both 26, from Worcester, have to make sure their daughter is never too far away from her ventilator - as a sudden snooze could prove fatal for her.

The 
condition is named after the myth of a water nymph, Ondine, who had an unfaithful
mortal lover called Palemon who swore to her that his 'every waking breath would be a 
testimony of his love'.

Upon witnessing his adultery, she cursed that if
he should fall asleep, he would forget to breathe.

The term is considered outdated for children with CCHS, who actually lack an arousal response to low oxygen levels and high CO2 levels in the blood when asleep.

Around 300 children worldwide and 30 people in the UK have the life-long condition.

The oldest CCHS patients today are in their 30s and 40s - CCHS young adults are in college, in the workplace, and some are having their own families.

Mr Wyse, a sales executive, said: 'We were terrified when doctors eventually discovered what was wrong with our little girl.

'She had been born a few weeks premature, and we thought she was just late in developing her breathing.

'But it quickly became apparent there was something much more seriously wrong.

'It's
difficult to play with her and act like a normal family, because we're 
always terrified she'll suddenly get sleepy and her breathing will go.

'Most parents probably love to see their little ones nod off in the middle of the day - but for us, it's frightening.

'Her ventilator is her lifeline, and we can't go anywhere without it.

'When she was eventually diagnosed, it almost felt like a relief to know what was actually wrong with her.

'But
then the full realisation of what that meant for our daughter - living 
on a ventilator for most of her life - really hit us, and it was 
heartbreaking.'

Doctors at 
Birmingham Children's Hospital carried on months of tests on Jovie when 
she was born - even believing at one point she may have meningitis.

But it was only after one surgeon who had seen a similar case in another baby that Jovie was tested for CCHS.

Six-month-old Jovie was diagnosed with congenital 
central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS) - also known as Ondine's curse -
meaning her body doesn't breathe automatically when she is asleep

The condition is so rare that there are only about 300 cases diagnosed worldwide.  She underwent a tracheotomy, and was kept on a ventilator 24 hours a day, as her parents watched her battle to breathe.

Eventually, she was allowed off the ventilator for short periods during the day - and is now considered well enough to be treated at home.

However, she will still have to spend most of her life with access to some form of ventilation, possibly limited to a mask at bedtime when she is older and stronger.

Jovie's condition is so dangerous that she will still have to be monitored constantly - including by a healthcare professional who will stay with her at home throughout the night, to ensure her breathing stays stable.

Mr Wyse added: 'Lorna and I have both had intensive training of how to monitor Jovie, and what to do if the ventilator or her tracheotomy fails - we have to be prepared for something like that to happen.

'Her breathing equipment needs cleaning every day, and we aren't allowed to leave her to anyone's care who hasn't been medically trained to look after her - so we can't leave her with friends or relatives. 

'But it was an amazing feeling to finally bring her home. She smiled and laughed when we put her down to bed - it was wonderful.

'We're hopeful that as Jovie grows bigger and stronger, she won't need to be on a ventilator all the time.

'At the very least, she will always have to wear a ventilation mask when sleeping - but we're hoping she should be able to grow up to live a normal life.

Lorna, a nursery nurse, added: 'We are so grateful for all the doctors and nurses at Birmingham Children's hospital - without them, Jovie might not be here today. 

'We're planning a big homecoming party for Jovie, and we'll also be running a charity auction for Ronald McDonald House, who helped us enormously over the last 10 months. 

'Local businesses have been very generous and we hope we'll be able to raise a lot of money for such a good cause.'
