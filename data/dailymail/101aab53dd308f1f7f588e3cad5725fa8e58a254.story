Philae probe ran out of energy yesterday after it rested against a cliff or crater wall with little sunlight to recharge,  but only after radioing back results of first and probably last batch of experiments to scientists

It is a 10-year mission hailed as a huge advance in learning about the darkest recesses of the universe, but that didn't stop the Philae probe from running out of battery power after just two days. 

The pioneering robotic spacecraft shut down yesterday after radioing results of its first and probably
last batch of scientific experiments from the surface of a
comet, scientists said.

Batteries aboard the European Space Agency's Philae comet
lander drained, shutting down the washing machine-sized probe
after an adventurous and largely unscripted 57-hour mission.

Carried aboard the orbiting Rosetta mothership, Philae
floated to the surface of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko on
Thursday, but failed to deploy anchoring harpoons.

Upon contacting the comet's unexpectedly hard surface, it
bounced back up into space twice then came to rest at a
still-unknown location about 1 km (0.6 mile) from its original
target.

Photos and other data relayed by Philae show it finally
landed against a cliff or crater wall where there was little
sunlight to recharge its batteries. 

Racing against the clock,
scientists activated a series of automated experiments, the
first to be conducted from the surface of a comet.

Philae's last task was to reposition itself so that as the comet soars towards the sun, its batteries may recharge enough for a follow-on mission to learn about the chemical composition of organic molecules

Before dying, Philae defied the odds and radioed its science
results back to Earth for analysis.

Its last task was to reposition itself so that as the comet
soars towards the sun, Philae's batteries may recharge enough
for a follow-on mission.

'Perhaps when we are nearer to the sun we might have enough
solar illumination to wake up the lander and re-establish
communication,' spacecraft operations manager Stephan Ulamec
said in a statement.

Scientists are particularly interested in learning about the
chemical composition of any organic molecules in samples drilled
out from the comet's body.

Comets are believed to be pristine remnants from the
formation of our solar system some 4.6 billion years ago. They
contain rock and ice that have preserved ancient organic
molecules like a time capsule and may provide insight into how
the planets and life evolved.

Philae's drill descended more than 25 cm (10 inches) on
Friday, penetrating the comet's surface.

Rosetta in August became the first spacecraft to put itself
into orbit around a comet. It will accompany the comet as it
travels towards the sun for at least another 13 months.
