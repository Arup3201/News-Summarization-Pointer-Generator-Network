Furious: Michelle Richards' right leg was needlessly amputate, but the surgeon has still not apologised

A surgeon who needlessly amputated a woman's leg in a shocking hospital blunder has escaped punishment from the General Medical Council.

Amit Sinha, an orthopaedic consultant at Ysbyty Glan Clwyd, Bodelwyddan, carried out an above knee amputation on Michelle Richards' right leg in 2006 after diagnosing osteomyeltitis, a serious and potentially life-threatening bone infection.

Mrs Richards, from Towyn, Conwy, already had a below-the-knee amputation on the same leg in 1995, partially as a result of her spina bifida.

But, after the operation, subsequent tests - carried out at the insistence of the mother-of-three - found no evidence of the disease and Mrs Richards was told: 'Sorry there's been a mistake.'

She then sued the surgeon's employer, the Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board, for medical negligence.

At the turn of this year the health board paid out an undisclosed sum to Mrs Richards in an out-of-court settlement and she received a formal apology from chief executive Mary Burrows for the error.

However she failed to receive a personal apology from the consultant.

In January, after the case was settled, she reported him to the GMC.

But last month, in a letter from its investigation officer, Tariq Massod, the GMC said it would be taking 'no further action' against Mr Sinha, the Daily Post reported.

The GMC case examiners accepted that there was 'no evidence of infection' in the stump and that Mr Sinha had failed 'good medical practice' in not referring for a second opinion.

They also said the amputation was not 'justified' and that his error could 'obviously be considered serious'.

'Having said that, this appears to be a single, isolated event and 
there is a possibility that the claimant may have undergone conversion 
to an above knee amputation due to subsequent neuropathic ulceration,' 
they added.

The case examiners went on to note that Mr Sinha had shown 'insight and remorse'.

They considered issuing a 'warning' but felt this would be a 'disproportionate response'.

The finding has angered Mrs Richards.

She told The Daily Post: 'The letter says Mr Sinha has 'shown remorse' but not to me. He has never apologised to me personally and as far as I can gather he still stands by his diagnosis. This is not even a rap around the knuckles.'

She was also furious at the 'insensitive assumption' that she may well have lost her leg anyway, as she says she cared for partially-amputated leg.

Before she lost the whole of her right leg she was mobile, could walk without the aid of a stick and push her grandchildren around in a pram.

It was in 2005 that she began to experience pain and a rash in her 'stump' and was told amputation was the solution to stop the infection spreading.

'After the amputation I lost a lot of mobility and now need a stick to get around. I am now finding it difficult to play with my younger grandchildren the way I used to.'

A spokesman for the GMC told the MailOnline that it did not comment on individual cases.

Mr Sinha provided a written statement to the GMC through his representatives. It said: 'We would submit that this error of judgement is a single isolated incident and an unusual departure from Mr Sinha's practice. We note that the GMC's expert, Mr Macdonald, acknowledges that there is a possibility that 'patient A (Mrs Richards)' would have had to have undergone an above knee amputation at some stage in the future.'

A health board spokeswoman added: 'The GMC have, at the request of Mrs Richards, investigated her complaint against Mr Sinha and found that there is no case to answer therefore the matter is closed.

'A full investigation was carried out during the litigation process and an apology has been issued to Mrs Richards by the chief executive of the health board.'
