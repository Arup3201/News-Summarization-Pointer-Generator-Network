A Brigham Young University freshman who suffered life-threatening injuries when she was hit by a car as she rode her longboard near campus is making a miraculous recovery, her family has said.

Lexi Hansen, 18, remains in critical but stable condition in hospital in Provo, Utah - but has amazed doctors by breathing on her own, spelling out words and even trying to get out of her bed.

Her family said they believe they are witnessing a miracle.

'When
 they brought her in, the doctors gave her less than a 5 per cent chance 
of survival,' Doug Hansen, Lexi's father, told the Deseret News.

'Miracle': Lexi Hansen, 18, was hit by a car while riding her longboard outside campus a week ago and slipped into a coma. But her family said she is now alert and recovering unexpectedly quickly

'They told us to call our
 family and get them here quickly because she wasnâ€™t going to last too 
long.'

Hansen, who regularly posts photos and videos of her longboarding feats to Facebook, was riding on University Avenue near the BYU campus on Wednesday 26 February when she was hit.

A witness told Provo Police that the teenager had her earphones in and appeared to be trying to beat a car that was turning across the road at about 6.20pm.

But she was hit by the vehicle, which had right of way. The driver immediately stopped and was not issued with a citation, in what police have called an unfortunate accident.

Hansen was not wearing a helmet at the time and sustained a head injury that put her in a coma for several days. Doctors have said that her brain could still continue to swell.

But on Sunday, she came out of the coma as her family sang hymns at her bedside, they said on a Facebook page dedicated to her recovery, Pray for Lexi.

Hopeful: Doctors were initially not sure if the teenager would survive but she is now breathing on her own

Support: Her large family, including her siblings (pictured), were singing hymns by her bed when she came out of her coma. Lexi (pictured third from right) then gave a hand signal for 'I love you', they said

'While we were singing, 
she hand signed, "I love you," moving her arm around so that everyone 
could see,' the family, who are Mormon, wrote on Facebook.

'She then reached for each person's hands individually so she 
could squeeze them. We could hardly sing due to the tears streaming down
 our face. We knew we were witnessing a miracle.'

On Monday, she had her breathing tube removed but her family said she remains in pain and spends much of her time sleeping. Still, they know their daughter is a fighter.

'Every single day is a miracle, every single day,' her mother Marcia said. 'It was a zero per cent when she was found, then one per cent the next day.

'Every doctor and nurse that comes in there, and therapist and whatever, they are just like, "You know this isn't supposed to happen. You know we are calling her the miracle girl, right?"'

Scene: She had her headphones in and was attempting to beat a car so that she could cross this intersection near BYU's campus - but the vehicle hit her and she suffered head injuries

The family said they do not blame the driver for the accident - and have even had dinner with him after reaching out to him.

'He's
 gone through torment,' Marcia told the Deseret News. 'We just wanted him 
to know that accidents happen, and we love him and we don't want him to 
feel guilty.'

She said she was grateful for messages of support from friends and strangers, which they have passed on to Lexi.

The teenager is a communications major at BYU and wants to be a motivational speaker. Just ahead of the accident, she told her family that motivational speakers had all suffered hardship.

'She said to me, "You know, Mom, to be a 
motivational speaker, everybody has been in some big accident or 
something." Yesterday I reminded her of that,' her mother said.
