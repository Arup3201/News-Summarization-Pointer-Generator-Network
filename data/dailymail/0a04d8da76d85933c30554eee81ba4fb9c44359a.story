Daniel Crowley scored a hat-trick for Arsenal's Under-19s as the young Gunners lost 4-3 away to Anderlecht in the UEFA Youth League.

The creative midfielder scored twice in the first 20 minutes to give Arsenal a 2-1 lead in Belgium following Leya Iseka's early penalty.

However, the Anderlecht striker levelled the scores just three minutes later to equalise, placing the ball past Gunners goalkeeper Bradley House when one-on-one.

The Belgians went on to score two more goals before half-time - Frank Mikal firing the ball inside the far post before Andy Kawaya found the net from 20 yards out - to lead 4-2 at the interval.

The away side had a number of chances in the second half but were unable to find the target until Crowley completed his hat-trick from the spot having been brought down in the area by Herve Matthys.

Arsenal will host Anderlecht, who are now joint-top of the table with the Gunners, in the next Group D fixture in two weeks' time.
