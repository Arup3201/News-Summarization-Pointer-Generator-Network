Shake up: Jeremy Hunt announced yesterday that elderly patients will be assigned a GP personally responsible for their care

Elderly patients are to be assigned a GP personally responsible for their care, Jeremy Hunt announced yesterday.

In a radical shake-up of care for the nation’s four million over-75s, the Health Secretary also promised telephone consultations day and night.

He said he was ripping up the controversial contract Labour struck with GPs in 2004 because it ‘broke’ the direct link between patient and practitioner.

Writing on this page, the Health Secretary says a new contract will make sure elderly patients have a ‘strong, personal and regular relationship with their GP’.

The GP will know their medical history and circumstances ‘just like the old family doctor knew everyone on their patch’.

The reforms are expected to ease the huge pressures on casualty units. A third of emergency admissions are for over-75s and most of these could have been avoided with better primary care.

Mr Hunt added: ‘Labour did terrible damage to out-of-hours care. Putting that right will take time.

'But this Government has a plan to do it. Today we take a step forward.’

Crucially, over-75s who want advice or reassurance will be guaranteed a same-day telephone consultation.

Surgeries will be responsible for ensuring patients can get through at all hours of the day or night, with many expected to run a shift system staffed with doctors and practice nurses.

Those that choose to contract out the service will be responsible for its quality – and subject to an inspection regime modelled on Ofsted’s oversight of schools.

The Health Secretary has created a new ‘chief inspector of GPs’ who he says will come down hard on surgeries that fail to provide a good service.

Mr Hunt says this means that even if a GP is not on call at weekends or evenings ‘the buck stops’ with them: ‘This is about fixing the long-term pressures on our A&E services, and improving care for those with the greatest need.’

Under a deal agreed with doctors’ leaders yesterday, GPs’ new responsibilities will take effect from April.

As well as offering patients same-day telephone consultations, they will have to coordinate care for elderly patients discharged from A&E and regularly review emergency admissions from care homes to avoid unnecessary call-outs in future.

Paramedics, A&E doctors and care homes will have a dedicated telephone line run by a GP practice so they can advise on treatment.

This avoids the need for a patient admitted to hospital having to undergo a barrage of unnecessary tests because their medical history is unknown.

Future hopes: Mr Hunt says he hopes a similar service will eventually be offered to millions more patients, such as children or those with long-term conditions

Mr Hunt says he hopes a similar service will eventually be offered to millions more patients, such as children or those with long-term conditions.

The trade-off for doctors is the scrapping of a series of ‘tick box’ targets they say hamper their  professional judgment and waste their time.

Labour allowed GPs to opt out of responsibility for patients outside office hours – and at weekends – as part of the botched deal that came into force in 2004.

Since then, private companies have taken over cover and in many cases have been forced to employ foreign doctors, often with little grasp of English.

The Daily Mail has repeatedly highlighted the deterioration in the service since the contract was changed.

The number of attendances at A&E has increased from 17.8million before the 2004 contract to 21.7million last year.

Ministers say the rise has been fuelled by the failure of doctors to provide a good service around the clock.

Chaand Nagpaul, chairman of the British Medical Association’s GP committee, said: ‘The BMA has sought to positively engage with the Government to address the difficult financial and workload pressures facing general practice in order to find new ways of improving patient care, while at the same time freeing up GPs and practice nurses from pointless bureaucracy.

‘Our agreement will deliver real benefit to patients and build on the work already carried out by GPs.

‘This will not only free up GPs to spend more time focusing on treating patients, but will also mean that valuable resources will be reinvested in general practice to improve frontline care.’

The deal also means patients will be able to book appointments or repeat a prescription online.

But Andy Burnham, Labour’s health spokesman, said: ‘No amount of spin can hide the fact that David Cameron has made it harder to get a GP appointment.

'There is nothing in this new contract to correct that.

‘David Cameron cut Labour’s scheme of evening and weekend opening and the guarantee of seeing a doctor within 48 hours.

‘This announcement will not put an end to patients phoning the surgery at 9am and finding it impossible to get an appointment many of whom, not happy with a phone consultation, will still turn to A&E.’

Taking a step forward: The Daily Mail is right to criticise Labour¿s 2004 GP contract. It broke the personal link between GP and patient, writes Jeremy Hunt

The Daily Mail is right to criticise Labour’s 2004 GP contract. It broke the personal link between GP and patient.

It piled target after target on doctors – and many of these targets were useless and distorted clinical priorities.

Over the past ten years, GPs have been de-professionalised – robbed of the right to make their own judgments and prevented from looking after their patients in the way they know best.

Labour’s 2004 contract also took responsibility for out-of-hours care away from GPs. As a result, 90 per cent of GPs do not provide it.

Inevitably, many people feel they have no choice when they want medical attention but to go to accident and emergency.

This puts huge pressure on our A&Es, especially during winter.

The Government has a plan to sort this out. Today, we are ripping up Labour’s old GP contract.

A new contract has been agreed. Labour may have destroyed the family doctor, but this Government will bring them back.

This is about fixing the long-term pressures on our A&E services, and giving elderly people the care and dignity they deserve.

Our priority has been the over-75s. This is because around two thirds of over-75s are living with a long-term condition such as diabetes, asthma, or dementia.

This can lead to preventable problems in A&E. One third of A&E visits are from over-75s, for example.

Many of these would be avoided if there was proper GP care in the evenings and weekends.

A&E staff don’t always know their underlying conditions or circumstances, or even where to discharge them to.

Cutting queues: It is hoped the shake up will ease pressure on A&Es - a third of admissions are aged over 75

That is the problem we have to solve. Our new GPs contract will make sure that Britain’s over-75s have a strong, personal and regular relationship with their GP.

Their GP will know them, and their conditions and circumstances – just like the old family doctor knew everyone on their patch.

But we also need to plan for the longer term. This is why Sir Bruce Keogh’s review of urgent and emergency care is so important. In fact it chimes with much of what the Daily Mail has been calling for.

Sir Bruce wants to see a fundamental shift in provision of urgent care.

Important: NHS medical director Professor Sir Bruce Keogh's review of emergency care is much needed, according to Jeremy Hunt

He has called for more extensive services outside hospital (which will help reduce A&E queues) and for patients with life-threatening or serious conditions to be treated in centres with the best clinical teams, expertise and equipment.

We know that certain conditions are better treated in fewer, more expert centres. For example, being treated in a stroke specialist centre reduces the chance of people dying.

Quite rightly, Sir Bruce says this approach will give people peace of mind: knowing the NHS will be there for them when they need it.

I know Daily Mail readers want that for their families. So do I.

Along with the biggest reforms to the GP contract since 2004, this Government has a plan to invest £3.8billion in integrating health and care, to stop patients falling between the gaps.

When elderly people have to go to hospital, there will now be quicker arrangements for their discharge – meaning more beds are free – and better arrangements when they come back, meaning fewer re-admissions.

To help A&E doctors, paramedics and care homes know more about elderly patients when they are unwell, GPs will – with proper consent – share medical records. And they will be at the end of a dedicated telephone line for out-of-hours care.

Better communication will be underpinned by a locally-led IT revolution. This will mean the NHS can be paperless by 2018.

And it will contrast with the billions of pounds wasted by Labour on a top-down system that was a disastrous failure.

The Daily Mail is absolutely right that Labour did terrible damage to out-of-hours care. Putting that right will take time. But this Government has a plan to do it. Today we take a step forward.
