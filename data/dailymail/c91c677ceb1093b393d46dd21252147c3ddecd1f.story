The gay prostitute who had sexual encounters with Shrien Dewani says the family of slain bride Anni treated him like a long-lost son when he met them as the 34-year-old millionaire faced a murder charge over the death of his  wife.

Leopold Leisser, AKA 'The German Master', from Birmingham, met Anni Dewani's parents Vinam and Nilam Hindocha in Cape Town, South Africa.

Prosecutors claimed Dewani ordered a hit on Anni because he was gay and wanted a way to get out of his marriage without shaming his family.

Dewani, who was cleared of plotting the murder last week and has now returned to the UK, admitted he was ‘bisexual’ in a three-sentence statement read to the Western Cape High Court, as a series of witnesses - including Mr Leisser - prepared to testify he was gay.

Mr Leisser, 43, admitted he was nervous about meeting the family in October, fearing they would judge him for how he makes his living.

He told the Sunday Mirror: 'I was apprehensive to meet them because of the line of business I am in and because of the nature in which I met Shrien.

'I was apprehensive and thought they would see me as a dirty, disgusting man. But it was the opposite. They were so grateful I had come forward.

'I was welcomed like a long lost son, in a way. It was surreal, sitting in a chair, surrounded by her family and them treating me like they’d known me for years.'

Anni’s uncle Ashok Hindocha said: 'We have got nothing against homosexuality or what he does or that he is a prostitute.

'He is still a human being and we’re grateful for what he did for us.'

After graduating, Dewani trained as an accountant and worked for Deloitte before joining his brother in the family business as a financial director.

By his early 20s, he had joined a gay dating website called Gaydar, using the name ‘asiansubguy’ – thought to be a reference to the fact that he liked to be submissive during sex with men. 

And he became a regular at the notorious Hoist nightclub in South London. Yet his strict family and religious background meant he kept the truth about his sexuality secret.

There was also, increasingly, pressure on him from his parents to get married, particularly after Preyen, his elder brother, settled down.

Shrien struggled in relationships with women. In 2008, he was introduced to a tycoon’s daughter called Rani Kansagra.

They were engaged within three months, but split up soon afterwards.

Three months after that relationship collapsed Dewani was introduced to Anni Hindocha, a Swedish engineering graduate, whose family had fled Uganda during Idi Amin’s bloody rule, and built up a business and a new life four hours from Stockholm.

On a visit to see her cousin, Sneha, in Luton in 2009, she was introduced to Shrien by mutual friends.

The pair continued to see each other, spending alternate weekends in Bristol and Stockholm. Shrien proposed to Anni at the Paris Ritz with a £25,000 diamond ring after flying his girlfriend out from London by private jet in 2010. Behind the scenes, however, the relationship was in turmoil. 

Dewani and Anni rowed repeatedly and, it is claimed, broke up several times during their 18-month courtship because of his ‘controlling’ behaviour and lack of sexual interest in her.

Her cousin Sneha Mashru, who was close to Anni, said: ‘Anni felt embarrassed and hurt, and we both felt it was weird. Anni and I speculated that maybe he was a virgin or perhaps just being proper.’

Mrs Mashru added that Dewani was always ‘very critical’ of Anni’s appearance.

Anni even broke off their engagement at one point. But Mr Hindocha says Dewani’s father phoned him and pleaded that Anni could ‘not do this’ as it would bring the Dewani family’s reputation ‘down to earth’ if he had a second failed engagement.

So Mr Dewani instructed his eldest son Preyen to get Shrien to be more affectionate, and Anni finally agreed to marry him, despite significant ‘misgivings’.

Throughout their relationship, he had begun secretly meeting Mr Leisser.

Anni and Dewani’s rows continued. Even as they planned the wedding in India, they argued over the colour of decorations, the theme for functions and the style of clothing.

At one point, Anni texted her cousin: ‘Fighting a lot with Shrien. Wish I never got engaged. Everyone tells me how fortunate I am…absolutely sick.’

Yet when the £200,000 wedding finally did go ahead at the five-star Mumbai Marriott set on the banks of Lake Powai, there were few public signs of tensions as 300 guests watched Shrien and Anni dance to the hit Bollywood song Pehla Nasha – First Love.

But after they went to the honeymoon suite, there was little romance. Shrien scolded Anni for not folding her clothes and spent the night on the sofa, their marriage un-consummated.

‘Crying has become my new hobby,’ Anni told a friend in one text. She also told friends she was already considering divorce before they left for their fateful honeymoon in South Africa.

Anni’s father, Vinod, said when he last spoke to her by phone on the afternoon of November 13 she said she had a ‘lot to tell him’ and needed to speak to him when she returned the following Tuesday.

They never spoke again. Later that night, Anni was shot dead after their car was hijacked in a township outside Cape Town, apparently on a sight-seeing tour because, according to Dewani, she wanted to see ‘the real Africa’.

Hours after her body was found, police found Dewani had logged on to Gaydar, the gay dating site, from the luxury hotel where they had been staying in Cape Town.

Ashok Hindocha, the uncle of Anni, told the Mail: ‘We couldn’t care less if someone is gay or not.

‘But Shrien was determined to marry a beautiful heterosexual girl. Whatever else happened, by marrying her knowing that he was gay, he had already ruined her life. For that we can never forgive him.’
