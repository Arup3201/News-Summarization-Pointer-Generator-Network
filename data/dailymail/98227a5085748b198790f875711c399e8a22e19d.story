Pervert: Robert Perez left one woman 'afraid to go outside' after plaguing her with sexually explicit calls

A Harrods chef who bombarded five women with perverted calls and sex texts has avoided a prison sentence.

Robert Perez, 31, left one woman ‘afraid to go outside’ after plaguing her with calls at her home so that he could live out his ‘sexual fantasies’.

The married cook, from Bletchley, Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire,  made groaning noises and touched himself as he whispered obscenities to his horrified victims, Isleworth Crown Court heard.

In one of the scores of calls Perez made over a 16-month period, he told one terrified woman: ‘I’m the one you want to f*** in the a***’.

Perez kept a several SIMs so he could phone his victims on different numbers, the court was told.

One card was found in his work locker at Harrods, while another number he used was from a phone belonging to his wife’s friend.

Perez told police he did it for his own sexual benefit and admitted masturbating and touching himself while on the phone to the victims.

Judge Martin Edmunds QC, allowed the pervert to escape jail with a three-year community and supervision order.

‘It would have been a suspended sentence but I don’t have the power to suspend it for three years’, he told Perez.

The court heard that Perez was either at home or visiting family in Harrow, northwest London, when he made dozens of calls to the five women from May 2012 until September 30 this year.

Once victim said in a statement that Perez had asked her to send him a picture of her naked during one terrifying phone call.

When he was arrested Perez confessed: ‘It’s mine, it’s the only one - it was me I made the calls.’

The court heard that Perez, who is soon to be a father with his wife, has since lost his job at Harrods and sought counselling.

At a previous hearing at Hammersmith Magistrates’ Court, District Judge Paul Clark described Perez’s crimes as ‘appalling’.

‘I am quite sure your victims were appalled by your behaviour and scared at least one of them who was afraid to go outside.’

Perez admitted five counts of stalking involving serious harm or distress to five different victims.
