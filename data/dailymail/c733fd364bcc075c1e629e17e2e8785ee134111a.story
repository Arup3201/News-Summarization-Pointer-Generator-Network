As a nanny lies in a medically-induced coma after allegedly stabbing two young children to death and slitting her own throat, questions remain over what pushed her to commit the horrendous crimes.

Now friends and relatives have revealed that Yoselyn
Ortega, a beloved and religious nanny who adored the family for which 
she worked, had recently appeared withdrawn, was struggling with money and may 
have visited a psychologist.

The speculation comes after Ortega allegedly stabbed six-year-old Lulu Krim and her two-year-old brother Leo to death in the bathtub at their parents' luxury Manhattan apartment.

Mystery: Yoselyn Ortega, pictured with Lucia Krim, right, and her sister Nessie, left, had been looking older and nervous in recent weeks, neighbours said. Others suggested she had money worries

As their mother, Marina Krim, arrived home to look for the children and the nanny, who had failed to meet her and her other daughter at a dance studio, she walked into the bathroom and saw Ortega, 50, stabbing herself and bleeding from the wrists, police said.

It is believed Ortega, herself a mother to a teenage son, had been working for Mrs Krim and her husband Kevin Krim, the vice president and general manager of CNBC Digital, for around a year.

In that time, the children - Lulu, Leo and three-year-old Nessie - had grown fond of their nanny, who told friends she enjoyed good pay and travel perks with the family.

But in her personal life, things were perhaps not so stable. Ortega had recently hinted at financial struggles to her friends and neighbours, the New York Times reported.

Her friend Maria Lajara said Ortega 
had asked her to 
pray that a woman who 'owed her a lot of money' would pay her, after she
had given her makeup to sell, but had not returned with the cash.

Neighbours added that the nanny herself would sell jewellery and makeup for 
extra income.

And, in what came as a devastating blow to Ortega, she was forced out of a new apartment in the Bronx in recent weeks and moved backed into her sister's cramped home in Harlem.

Ortega, whose name had never been on a lease for the apartment, was promptly kicked out when the original tenant returned, the Times reported.

Others added she had not seemed herself recently, complaining that she was tired, while her niece, Katherine Garcia, 
added that her aunt had been 'acting kind of nervous lately'.

Speaking to the Wall Street Journal,
neighbours said that Ortega would always say 'God Bless You' as she 
passed - but her salutations had recently become less frequent.

'In the building, everyone was talking about how she didn’t look good,' neighbour Ruban Rivas said.

Just half an hour before the murders, a 
neighbour, Charlotte Steinberg, saw Ortega, Lulu and Leo in the elevator
and described the nanny as 'cold' with a 'poker face'.

New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly added that Ortega’s family told the police she may have visited a psychologist recently or
had been thinking about going.

Despite these troubles, family and 
friends are baffled as to what pushed the beloved nanny over the edge 
and want to hurt the family who had so eagerly welcomed her.

William Krim, the paternal grandfather of the children, told the New York Times: 'They were very good to her. We're just the most stunned people in the world - I mean, they treated this woman so well.'

His wife, Karen Krim, added to the New York Daily News: 'They just bent over backwards being nice to this woman. They were always doing things that were just fabulous for her.'

Ortega herself acknowledged this 
amazing treatment, telling friends that she liked Mrs Krim so much she 
was regularly happy to stay for extra hours to help her out.

'She really loved them, the family,' her friend Maria 
Lajara told the Times. 'She loved the kids, she would take them to the park, and 
she said the mom was a really good person.'

Lajara added that the Krims had been generous to their nanny; earlier this year Ortega gave Lajara a leather jacket that Mrs Krim had given her as a gift.

And William Krim added that, when his son's family went away, they paid for Ortega's ticket to fly to the Dominican Republic to see her own family there.

On one occasion, which is documented on Mrs Krim's blog, they travelled to the Dominican Republic with their nanny as she wanted them to meet her family.

'It was wonderful,' Mrs Krim wrote of the trip in February. 'And we met Josie's amazing famila! The Dominican Republic is a wonderful country!!'

Yet now, just months on, the woman the Krims invited into their home and trusted with their children is lying in a hospital bed, with police officers ready to question her for murder.

'We're just having a really, really hard time here,' the children's grandmother Karen Krim added. 'It's the worst nightmare any parent could ever have.'
