Guided by voices: Clinton D. Inabnit, 40, told his interrogators that 'these people' whispered messages to him to kill 57-year-old Mark Stanziano and that if he did, the ringing in his ears would stop. Inabnit is accused of shooting Stanziano in the street outside his Somerset, Kentucky office

A Kentucky man accused of killing a prominent area lawyer told police that hidden messages he received from music and newspapers made him do it, court testimony revealed Wednesday.

Clinton Inabnit, 40, told interrogators after he allegedly gunned down 57-year-old Mark Stanziano on June 27 that whispers from 'these people' told him ringing in his ears would only stopped if he murdered the well-liked Somerset, Kentucky defense attorney.

Somerset detective Chris Gates testified at a preliminary hearing Wednesday that Inabnit told police he didn't want to kill Stanziano, but he had to.

Inabnit lived in an apartment directly across the street from the attorney's office.

Inabnitt allegedly fired seven shots from a 9mm pistol at him from less than 15 feet away as Stanziano arrived for work.

Stanziano was pronounced dead at the scene at 9:12 a.m.

Among
 Stanziano's high profile cases was an acquittal last year for a Wayne 
County man accused of murdering his 20-month-old son after the boy drank
 drain cleaner in a mobile home that was host to a meth production 
operation.

A
 police arrest citation says Inabnitt told officers that he shot 
Stanziano because the attorney declined to help him with a problem the 
previous night and laughed at him.

Defense attorney Richard Leary whispers to Clinton Inabnitt shortly before a court hearing on Wednesday where a police officer recounted when the 40-year-old accused killer said hidden messages in newspaper and music told him to murder a man

Inabnitt appeared largely unmoved as a witnessed painted him as a mentally unsound killer

According
 to a report from the Lexington Herald-Leader, Inabnitt later admitted 
to being angry not because Stanziano denied him help but because he 
laughed at him.

Police found out during about 45 minutes of interrogation that Inabnitt warned Stanziano the day before the shooting that there were people who wanted him killed, and they wanted Inabnitt to carry out the slaying, Gates said. Inabnitt told police that Stanziano laughed off the warning.

'Later that evening ... he stated that he had deciphered a message in the paper that this was something that he had to do,' said Gates, who participated in the questioning. 'He made it very clear to us that he said this is something I don't want to do but it's something that I had to do.'

Gunned down: Somerset police say 57-year-old attorney Mark Stanziano was shot at least four times about 8 a.m. June 27 by a man who lives across the street. A police citation said Inabnitt said he killed Stanziano after the lawyer refused to help him with an unknown task and then laughed at him

Inabnitt also said he had received messages through music to target Stanziano, Gates said. The detective didn't mention any songs. Police later executed a search warrant at Inabnitt's residence and seized a box of ammo, a newspaper, iPhone and laptop computer, Gates testified.

When Inabnitt's pockets were emptied by police, they found about 10 bullets, he said.

Inabnitt purchased the handgun about a year before the shooting, the officer said.

Police also have reviewed surveillance video from a business that has aided the investigation, Gates said.

Inabnitt, clad in an orange jail jumpsuit, sat quietly during the testimony.

His attorney, Richard Leary, argued that the charge should be reduced to manslaughter.

Afterward, Leary told reporters that Inabnitt's comments to police 'tend to lend credence to the fact that he might have been not in his complete right mind when this happened, and we're going to get into that.'

'That's a mountain that has to be climbed to see what the mental state was here of my client during the alleged commission of this crime,' he said.

Scene: Witnesses have told police them the man had been contact with Stanziano on Thursday evening and had previously threatened the attorney
