A Florida trucker found himself frozen to the ground beneath his massive rig while stopped in Indiana on Monday morning, but despite all odds has lived to tell the tale after voice command allowed him to call for help.

Tim Rutledge of Orlando pulled over at a truck stop near Indianapolis after his brakes became frozen by the historic -40F wind chills.

When he climbed beneath his truck to try and fix them, the vehicle shifted and pinned Rutledge to the ground for nearly eight hours.

'Nobody could hear me': Long haul trucker Tim Rutledge became pinned beneath his truck in the middle of Monday's historic wind chills and dip in temperature near Indianapolis

'My left arm was pinned by the axle': Rutledge's brakes had frozen and he stopped at a truck stop to crawl beneath and try to fix them. That's when the massive rig shifted in the snow and pinned him to the cold pavement

'It caught my left side and my left arm was pinned by the axle of the truck,' Rutledge said.

Unable to move, Rutledge lay there helplessly as arctic winds blasted him--eventually freezing his body to the pavement.

'As I got colder and colder, I was yelling but nobody could hear me,' he told Fox59.

The virtually deserted Pilot station was in the grip of the Polar Vortex and, like people in much of the nation, locals had sought shelter indoors.

'As I got colder and colder, I was yelling': Rutledge desperately cried for help but everyone was indoors at this Pilot station near Indianapolis, where wind chills Monday hit -40F

'That's the only morning he never really called me': Rutledge had been a truck driver for years and when he didn't call his wife Lisa, she became worried and frantically dialed his number--which eventually saved his life

In the numbing cold, all Rutledge could feel was the incessant vibration of his cell phone ringing in his pocket.

It was his wife and she was desperate to know where Rutledge was.

'That's the only morning he never really called me, so I just still can't believe that he didn't,' a relieved Lisa told WOFL.

But Rutledge couldn't get to the phone.

It feels like a miracle, then, that all those unanswered phone calls actually saved Rutledge's life.

The vibrations eventually made the phone fall out of the desperate man's pocket.

'When the phone did finally come out, it came in front of me instead of behind me,' Rutledge said.

Despite all the hope the phone gave him, Rutledge was far too cold to dial anyone's number. 

Miracle: Lisa's frantic calls were causing her husband's phone to vibrate in his pocket as he lay frozen to the ground. Eventually it tumbled out

Through biting winds and despite all odds, Rutledge was able to use the phone's voice activation function to get the phone to make a call, but he wasn't even sure who it was.

It turned out to be his employers. After a day and at the verge of death, he would be saved.

'I remember saying, I said "Whoever this is, whatever you do, don’t hang up the phone,"' Rutledge said.

His boss and other employees called 911 and were able to locate Rutledge, who thinks he may have blacked out just as his location was found.

'I said, "I just can’t hold on any longer" and that was the last thing I remember saying,' Rutledge said.

Rutledge was saved, however. And as he lay in a hospital bed very nearly well enough to go home, he sent out his thanks to everyone who helped keep him alive.

'Thank you very much to every person involved, especially the people there at the Pilot store and the EMS people that crawled under there in the freezing weather and dug me out,' Rutledge said.

Saved: Rutledge was too frozen to dial a number but somehow managed to reach his employers, who helped locate and rescue him. 'I just can¿t hold on any longer,¿ is the final thing he remembers saying
