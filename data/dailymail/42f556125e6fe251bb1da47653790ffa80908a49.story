A heavily pregnant women visited her GP for a whooping cough vaccination - only to be injected with an MMR jab.

Emma Cave, 25, won a payout of £3,000 from her GP after she was mistakenly given the MMR jab 30 weeks into her pregnancy.

The young mother said she suffered months of worry following the blunder after doctors told her they could not guarantee there was no risk to her unborn baby.

Miss Cave went to the GP practice for a whooping cough vaccination but was later informed she'd been accidentally given the MMR jab. She had to wait until her son Harrison was six-weeks-old before she could finally be told for certain that he had not been harmed

Miss Cave had to wait until her son Harrison was six-weeks-old before she could finally be told for certain that he had not been harmed.

As the MMR jab is prepared with weakened live viruses, doctors advise it is not suitable for women who are pregnant or who might become pregnant within a month after being vaccinated.

Miss Cave said she was terrified to find out she had been given the jab while heavily pregnant.

As the MMR jab is prepared with weakened live viruses, doctors advise  it is not suitable for women who are pregnant, or who might become pregnant within a month after being vaccinated.

In theory, the weakened virus could give the mother an infection that they could pass on to their baby.

The vaccinations recommended for pregnant women are:

Flu jab

Pregnant women have a higher chance of developing complications if they get flu, particularly in the later stages of pregnancy.

Doctors advise getting vaccinated as soon as possible into the pregnancy.

The flu vaccine is normally available from September until around January or February each year and is free for pregnant women.

Whooping cough

Whooping cough is common at the moment and babies who are too young to start their vaccinations are at greatest risk.

Young babies with whooping cough are often very unwell and most will be admitted to hospital because of their illness. In severe cases, they can die. 

Pregnant women should ideally get vaccinated 28- 32 weeks into their pregnancy, although they may be given the vaccine up to 38 weeks of pregnancy.

She said: 'It is hard to take what has happened and remove it from your mind. 

'I still can't understand how they made such as mistake.'

Miss Cave, of Pudsey, West Yorkshire, went to a Leeds GP surgery last year for the whooping cough vaccine, which is routinely given during pregnancy.

The next day she was contacted and told of the mistake.

She said: 'I felt sick to the stomach when they told me what had happened. 

'It was all a complete shock as you expect nurses and doctors to know what they are doing, and not make such silly, potentially serious mistakes.

'It wouldn't have been so bad had they been able to fully assure me there and then that there was no danger of harm to my baby, but they couldn't.'

Miss Cave was sent to hospital, where she and partner Luke Egan were told the effect on their son would only become clear after their baby was born.

'From that point on I was constantly worrying' she said.

'I was in and out of hospital for checks because I couldn't feel the baby moving on many occasions, although perhaps the anxiety and stress of all I had gone through made me panicky.'

Miss Cave took legal action through Neil Hudgell Solicitors and the GP surgery admitted the mistake and apologised.

Senior solicitor Kay Barnes said: 'It was a mother's nightmare, an unfortunate incident involving negligent treatment which could have been completely avoided had proper care been taken.'
