Joel Campbell has proved himself in the Champions League, La Liga, Ligue 1, Greek Super League and now, on the biggest stage of them all, the World Cup.

But the forward, having spent three of his five-year deal with Arsenal on loan to other clubs, is yet to be given a chance in the Premier League by Arsene Wenger.

The 21-year-old put in a commanding performance for Costa Rica in their 3-1 win over Uruguay, scoring one and setting up another, but will that be enough to make it on to the Arsenal manager's radar or will it go unnoticed for another year?

Ready: Campbell has cut his teeth with Lorient, Real Betis and Olympiacos but looks ready to return

Are you watching, Arsene? Wenger may take notice of Campbell's commanding performance against Uruguay

2009-2011: SAPRISSA (2 APPS/0 GOALS)

2011: PUNTARENAS (loan) (5/0)

2011-NOW: ARSENAL (0/0)

2011-2012: LORIENT (loan) (25/3)

2012-2013: REAL BETIS (loan) (28/2)

2013-2014: OLYMPIACOS (loan) (32/8)

Campbell, just as he did in the Champions League against Manchester United at Old Trafford, proved worthy of the competition in Brazil by scoring an impressive goal.

His strike in the 54th minute brought Costa Rica level, having taken a moment to control the ball, set himself and beat goalkeeper Fernando Muslera with a superb half-volley.

They went on to score two more, securing a surprise win over a Uruguay lacking striker Luis Suarez.

The third and killer goal by substitute Marco Urena was set up by an inch-perfect through-ball by Campbell, too.

Even towards the dying minutes, the youngster was winning corners to eat up time and, albeit inadvertently, was fouled by a frustrated Maxi Pereira, who saw red for the ugly challenge.

Chance: Campbell scored one, assisted another, killed time towards the end and was fouled in the red card

Missing: Campbell couldn't find himself in Panini

Joel Campbell may have struggled to find a sticker of himself before the World Cup began but he certainly made himself known to those unaware of his talents with a superb display against Uruguay.

The Arsenal striker infamously bought 100 packs of Panini World Cup stickers in April â€“ and failed to find a single one of him.

He posted an image including a pile of what he says is 100 opened packets, each of which include five stickers so 500 in total, and lamented that none of them included him.

On loan at Olympiacos last season, the 21-year-old shone in the Champions League last 16 round against Manchester United, and his latest match-winning performance in Brazil will not have gone unnoticed by Arsene Wenger.

Campbell's five-year contract with Arsenal in 2011 has seen him go largely unnoticed at the Emirates.

He was shipped out on loan to Ligue 1's Lorient and La Liga's Real Betis, before becoming instrumental in Olympiacos winning the Greek Super League by a landslide 17 points.

Campbell is eligible to play for Arsenal, having tweeted his joy at receiving a work permit in July 2013.

The World Cup can often act as an audition for players, and Campbell made his chance count. The extent, though, is down to Wenger.

Allowed: Campbell was eligible to play for Arsenal last year, having received his work permit in July 2013
