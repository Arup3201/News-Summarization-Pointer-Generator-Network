Sergeant Major Harry Gurung killed a married couple when he had a sneezing fit as he was overtaking them on his way to his army barracks, a court has heard

A leading Gurkha soldier killed a married couple when he had a sneezing fit as he was overtaking them on his way to his army barracks, a court has heard.

Sergeant Major Harry Gurung, 45, clipped the rear of David and Mary Marhsall's Ford Ka which then hit a tree on the A40 near Abergavenny, South Wales, Newport Crown Court was told.

Retired RAF Flight Sergeant Mr Marshall, 79, was killed outright in the crash.

His wife, Mary, 73, died four days later.

Career soldier Gurung told police: 'I put my right indicator on and as I overtook I began sneezing in rapid succession.

'I was trying to keep my eyes on the road and then I felt a muscle cramp in my stomach.

'I kept my right hand on the steering wheel and put my left hand to my stomach.

'I was trying all I could to control my vehicle. That was the last memory I have, it all happened so quickly.'

Mr and Mrs Marshall were returning home from a summer church barbecue when they were killed in July last year.

The court heard analysis of the onboard computer of Gurung’s VW Golf showed he was travelling at a speed of between 69-78mph - with an average of 74mph.

The Gurkha had driven to an Army event in Swindon at 6.15am and was on his way back to his base in Brecon, Powys, when he claims he was hit by the sneezing fit at 9.25pm.

Gurung, who is no longer in the army and 
has a civilian job for the Ministry of Defence, is chairman of the Wales
 Nepalese Society.

He denies two charges of causing death by dangerous driving and two alternative charges of causing death by careless driving.

The trial continues.
