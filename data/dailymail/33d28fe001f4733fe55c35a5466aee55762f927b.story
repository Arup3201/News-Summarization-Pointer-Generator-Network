Green, they may be. But electric cars have struggled to overcome one of the main shortfalls that put buyers off - an inferior range to their petrol-powered rivals.

That may be about to change after a new electric car was unveiled that promises to go 500 miles (800km) before the battery needs recharging.

This would be far more than one of the current leaders in the field, the battery/ gasoline Chevrolet Volt, which can do around 375 miles (600km) on one charge-up.

Going the distance: The QBEAK electric car which promises to go 500 miles before the battery needs recharging

On the horizon: A battery/fuel cell demonstration model of the QBEAK is expected to arrive sometime in 2013

The Modular Energy Carrier concept (MECc), created by three Danish companies, uses bio-methanol to bolster its battery life.

Mogens
 Lokke, CEO of ECOmove, designers of the innovative 'QBEAK' car said 
bio-methanol was far better than diesel or gasoline because it produces 
substantially less carbon dioxide.

'In
 combination with the way we built the car, which is really lightweight 
(425 kilograms), we can get the 500-mile range,' he told CNN.

A
 bio-methanol/ water is converted by the fuel cell to create 
electricity, while waste heat from the process powers the car's heating 
and cooling system.

One right royal potential owner: Prince Charles has a look inside one of ECOmove's electric concept cars during a visit to Denmark earlier this year

Keen interest: Prince Charles and Camilla were both given the low-down on the new designs when they visited Vitus Bering Innovation Park in May

It also benefits from a innovative chassis design which has really pushed the technology forward.

'Instead
 of putting in a fixed battery, we have built in (six) modules that can 
be fitted inside the chassis. We can use battery power in the modules or
 any other kind of energy source,' Lokke said.

The award-winning QBEAK also uses patented in-wheel electric motors to deliver a top speed of 75mph (120kph).

The car caught the attention of royalty earlier this year when Prince Charles and Camilla paid a visit to Denmark.

Driver: A novel chassis design means it will contain six electric modules rather then a single fixed battery

Imminent: The QBEAK project hopes to launch a battery-powered model with a range of 186 miles this year

They both climbed into the QBEAK car when they arrived at Vitus Bering Innovation Park in May.

Mr LÃ¸kke, introduced the e-car and its many features, while the royal couple listened attentively. Prince Charles promised to follow ECOmove in the future and said that he finds the QEAK-concept very interesting.

'This
 is indeed a fantastic opportunity for us to spread the message about 
ECOmove and our e-car QBEAK to a wider audience', he said.

According
 to Mads Friis Jensen from Serenergy, the designers of the fuel cell, 
bio-methanol is a cheap and abundant fuel with a short carbon chain.

Challenging petrol: The award-winning QBEAK also uses patented in-wheel electric motors to deliver a top speed of 75mph (120kph)

Green machine: The car's fuel cell converts a bio-ethanol/ water mix into electricity to power the battery

Compared to gasoline, bio-methanol production can cut CO2 emissions by more than 70 per cent

The U.S. Department for Energy (DOE) says direct methanol fuel cells are not hampered by the storage problems that affect other green fuels like hydrogen because as a liquid it's easier to transport and supply through current infrastructure.

The QBEAK project hopes to launch a battery-powered model with a range of 186 miles (300 kilometers) later this year.

The battery/fuel cell version is expected to arrive sometime in 2013.
