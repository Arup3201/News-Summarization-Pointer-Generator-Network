A group of friends has launched Britain's first darts team for the blind, by using string to help them find the bullseye.

Humorously named 'The Optimists', teammates Richard Pryor, Rachael Beresford, Carol Pirret and Sharon Waters admit some wayward darts have already caused damage to the inside of their local pub The Dolphin Inn in Grampound, Cornwall.

The group guide their darts with a piece of string attached to the board which helps them feel where it is.

Then when a player heads to the line they grab the cord with their spare hand and throw with the other. 

The friends have been hard at work honing their skills, ready for their first match, and father-of-two Mr Pryor, 68, said they are now hitting the board about two out of every three throws.

The former social worker said: 'The landlord mentioned that the Rotary Club had organised for pubs to take part in a fast darts competition.

'He asked if we wanted to put in a blind darts team. After three pints I am up for anything and we said yes.

'No one has been injured yet, although there has been quite a bit of damage to the door and around the board.

'Just because you can't see it doesn't mean it's the end of the world. I have been blind for nearly 40 years and I have a superb time, I wouldn't swap it for anything.

'However, on the night people might want to stand back a little bit as I don't think we get any points for hitting the spectators.'

Mr Pryor went completely blind over the course of three days when his retinas haemorrhaged irreversibly and without warning 38 years ago.

But he refuses to give up on his favourite hobbies and activities, and organises a monthly support group for the blind and visually impaired. 

Sharon Waters lines up a shot.  The four wholly visually impaired teammates will take part in their first game on Thursday

Team member Carol Pirret has the best vision of the group but is still partially sighted due to a condition called Pseudoxanthoma elasticum or PXE

Ms Pirret said: 'I'm very excited for the competition, it's the only social thing I really do. It's a good bit of fun joining in the darts team'

It was through this group that he advertised for players and was soon swamped with volunteers.

Team mate Sharon Walters, 46, a mum-of-two and former carer, has serious visual impairment due to a benign brain tumour.

Rachael Beresford, 39, a DJ and former hospice volunteer, is completely blind due to glaucoma and diabetes.

Making up the foursome is Carol Pirret, 53, who has the best vision of the group but is still partially sighted due to a condition called Pseudoxanthoma elasticum or PXE.

The team have until Thursday to perfect their technique before they take part in the fast darts contest, where teams score as many points as possible in 90 minutes.

There are 14 other clubs taking part this year - but all the others can see.

Ms Walters said: 'Seeing as it's for charity I thought, "Oh why not?" It's going to be fun, I think, but I don't fancy our chances.'

Team founder Richard Pryor said the friends have been hard at work honing their skills, ready for their first match, and are now hitting the board about two out of every three throws

He said: 'Just because you can't see it doesn't mean it's the end of the world. I have been blind for nearly 40 years and I have a superb time, I wouldn't swap it for anything'

But they admit they are causing a little damage to the 17th Century Dolphin Inn, in Cornwall

Ms Pirret said: 'I'm very excited for the competition, it's the only social thing I really do. It's a good bit of fun joining in the darts team.'

Mrs Beresford played darts before losing her sight.

She added: 'I used to play for fun and it's great to give it another go. I didn't think I would be able to do it but so far I'm getting most of them on the board.'

Donna Fryer, 41, landlady of the 17th-century Dolphin Inn, said she wasn't too worried about the damage caused by stray arrows.

She said: 'I think it's great they are entering the competition.

'They support us so often, by coming in here for their meetings. It's great to be able to support them back by letting them play in the competition here.

'There's been a few holes in the walls, but that doesn't matter - it all adds to the character of the pub.'
