Sara Davis had a happy summer. The company director could race around the Home Counties from meeting to meeting in her Nissan Juke without so much as a hint of a traffic jam.

Now she has to allow an hour for a journey that in August took 30 minutes, fits in far fewer meetings and arrives home late and frustrated each evening. Just thinking about sitting behind the wheel makes her stressed.

She is in no doubt whose fault that is.

‘When the school run starts in early September, the misery begins,’ says 35-year-old Sara Davis from Surrey

‘When the school run starts in early September, the misery begins,’ says the 35-year-old from Ashtead, Surrey.

‘It’s like an annual migration. Herds of mothers pack themselves onto the roads in their 4x4s and SUVs with no regard for other road users, then trundle off mindlessly like lemmings.

‘There’s nothing more annoying than sitting in traffic when you need to be somewhere on time, all because of mothers driving their children to school — especially when half the cars have only one child in them.’

Retired business analyst Preston Cater, 60 says: ‘Chaotic parking is normal and at 8.55am the car horns start’

Sara’s annoyance began several years ago when she was working in Chigwell, Essex, near a prep school.

‘Every morning it delayed me by at least half an hour. The area was well served by public transport, but I never once saw a child or mother walking down the road.

‘Every car was a huge 4x4 and most of the children were watching DVDs on the in-car entertainment systems. They were deposited at the school front door.

‘If mums couldn’t get through the gates, they just ditched the cars in the road or on the verges. Anyone who objected was likely to get a mouthful of abuse.’

Sara’s anger is being echoed by drivers all around the country. Come 8.30am, with the rush hour in full swing, an extra million parents get into their cars to drive their children to school.

That adds 150 per cent to commuters’ journey times, according to sustainable transport pressure group Sustrans, while the mums are travelling, on average, just over a mile-and-a-half.

Nowadays, nearly half of all schoolchildren are driven to school, despite most living within a 25-minute walk or 15-minute cycle ride. Twenty years ago, it was just one child in five.

The influx of cars not only clogs roads, but causes problems for residents when mothers in a rush abandon their vehicles in the road or block driveways.

‘School mums fly round the corner of my one-lane street as if they own the road, then just sit there staring you out if you have the temerity to be coming in the opposite direction,’ says Louisa Bishop, 45, an office worker who lives near a primary school in Blackheath, South-East London.

‘Normally it’s fine — you wait and the other driver will thank you or they let you through first.

‘But not school mums. I’m the one who always has to reverse because in minutes there will be three or four of them in a line, honking their horns. Once I was trapped for six minutes.

‘It’s all so unnecessary. Why can’t they just walk?’

Retired business analyst Preston Cater, 60, lives near a school in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire.

‘Chaotic parking is normal and at 8.55am the car horns start,’ he says. ‘Parents deliberately park their cars just anywhere.’

Andrew Balkin, a health adviser, is equally frustrated. The 42-year-old from Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, says: ‘I came out of my house one day to find a mother parking across my driveway.

‘I told her politely that I had to get out because I had a meeting, but she started swearing at me using every word in the book — in front of her son, who could only have been nine.

‘She stomped off, leaving me stranded. It was 20 minutes before she returned. I was furious. Then I had to deal with a client equally angry that I was late.’

The school run doesn’t just affect people’s moods; it also has a severe effect on business. According to Aberdeen University, it costs the economy £88 million in wasted time each year.

While some children live too far from school to walk or are too young to take a bus by themselves, rising numbers are being driven to the gates because of parental anxiety about their safety.

Mother-of-two Ingrid Dearling, 37, from Reigate, Surrey, says: ‘I live 2½ miles from my children’s primary school and they are too young to get the bus on their own. What can I do? I don’t feel I should apologise. For most mothers, the school run in the car is a necessity. It’s not as though it’s an enjoyable thing to do in the morning.’

Mum and midwife Helen Dawson, 36, from Leeds, also believes that there is no alternative for busy working mothers.

‘Everyone needs to take their children to school,’ she says. ‘When you’re in a rush to get to work, you can’t just park miles away to please the neighbours.’

Yet irresponsible parking can have unforeseen consequences. Police were called to Fixby junior school in Huddersfield after an ambulance trying to reach a sick child took 15 minutes to battle the last 300 yards to the school because people had left their cars strewn about.

‘The ambulance driver was at a loss for words,’ fumed head teacher Claire Allen in a letter to parents.

In Roundhay, Leeds, 83-year-old Michael Bligh feels trapped by parents gridlocking the streets around St John’s Church of England primary.

‘They use my driveway to turn their cars around, and once someone blocked the gateway when my brother was ill and needed to get to a doctor’s appointment,’ he says. ‘When I confronted them, they hurled abuse at me.’

The school run can also cause accidents. Between 2011 and 2012, there were more than 800 serious and fatal injuries to children at school run times, according to Road Safety Analysis research.

Every month, 1,100 children suffer some form of injury on their way or from school.

‘The figures are not surprising,’ says Nick Lloyd, of the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents. ‘These are the peak times for road accidents.’

Many mothers blame oversubscription to schools for the increase in school run problems.

Kay Rogers, 44, an interior designer from Bristol, says: ‘I have to drive as I have girls at two schools. I can’t walk it.’

Other mothers admit that they drive their children to school as it’s convenient.

‘Driving means I can quickly drop off my eight-year-old, then get on with other things I need to do,’ says 32-year-old Rosie Hodgson, from Laleham, Surrey.

Her child’s school, Laleham Church of England primary, holds a fortnight-long initiative each year to try to get people to car-share or walk to school.

‘Once it has finished, everyone starts coming in their cars again,’ says 44-year-old Jo Sturdy, who lives just over a mile away.

In Montpelier in Edinburgh, there were calls from residents for an exclusion zone to keep motoring mothers out of the genteel Georgian neighbourhood.

Mum-of-three Larra Praino, 33, walks her children to school there and despairs at what she sees.

‘Parents reverse their cars and chuck out their children in a hurry,’ she says. ‘It’s lazy and careless. It’s so easy to walk.’

Edinburgh city leaders are considering whether to introduce a ban. It can be done: this year, East Lothian Council banned cars from roads leading to three primary schools in Haddington at peak time. Traffic wardens and police enforce the rule.

The 18-month pilot, which could be extended if it proves successful, has even proved to be a hit with many parents.

Michelle Wall, 30, whose son Matthew, five, goes to Haddington infant school, says: ‘Maybe it is bit inconvenient for some parents, but it’s absolutely necessary.’

The school run problem is so acute that in 2008 an all-party parliamentary committee was established to look at ways of weaning over-protective parents from their cars

The school run problem is so acute that in 2008 an all-party parliamentary committee was established to look at ways of weaning over-protective parents from their cars.

It recommended a system of U.S.-style yellow school buses.

A pilot scheme in West Yorkshire, where 200 of the custom-made buses were introduced, was successful — but then came the recession and plans to roll out the initiative were ditched.

Health experts and council officials agree that encouraging mothers to walk their children to school would be the best solution. And according to Sustrans, they could save themselves £600 a year by doing so. Now, isn’t that an incentive?
