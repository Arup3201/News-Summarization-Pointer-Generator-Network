Lord Windermere, the 2014 Cheltenham Gold Cup winner, has been confirmed as a ‘definite’ starter in the Crabble’s Grand National at Aintree on Saturday week.

Trainer Jim Culloty has made no public comment since the nine-year-old was pulled up behind Coneygree last month when trying to defend his title.

Since that run jockey Davy Russell has lost the ride on Lord Windermere, although a broken arm 24 hours after that news emerged means Russell would not have been available anyway.

Culloty will also be represented by Spring Heeled, who also won at last season’ s Cheltenham Festival, as his launches a twin assault on the £1million prize.

A spokeswoman for Culloty’s Co Cork stable said: ‘Both horses are definite runners. There are no concrete jockey plans at the moment.’

Victory for either gelding, both of which run in the colours of Dr Ronan Lambe, would make Culloty, who won the 2002 race as a jockey on board Bindaree, only the sixth man to both ride and train a Grand National winner.

Best known as the rider of three-time Cheltenham Gold Cup winner Best Mate, Culloty would also join Fred Winter as the only man to have ridden and trained the winner of both the Grand National and Gold Cup.

Jockey options for the Culloty pair could include Robbie McNamara, who won the 2014 Fulke Walwyn Kim Muir Challenge Cup on Spring Heeled, who has been kept fresh for his National challenge.

Spring Heeled is a 20-1 shot for the Aintree race but confirmation that Lord Windermere, due to carry top weight of 11st 10lb, will run could prompt the few bookmakers making his a 50-1 shot to trim his odds back in line with rivals.

Definitely out of the National is Jonjo O’Neill’s Merry King, who has a breathing problem while Nicky Henderson’s Hadrian’s Approach is rated ‘very doubtful’ after picking up a leg injury.

Merry King’s exit frees up jockey Richie McLernon, who looks a riding option for Emma Lavelle’s Court By Surprise.

Alan King has confirmed Godsmejudge, the 2013 Scottish National winner, run despite the gelding being beaten almost 70 lengths on his latest run over hurdles at Bangor.

King said: ‘I don’t know what happened at Bangor. It just did not happen for him but he is in good form and Wayne Hutchinson rides.’

Ryan Moore rides War Envoy for Aidan O’Brien in the Listed Patton Stakes at Dundalk on Wednesday night as trainer’s son Joseph, who had said he expected to be in action at the meeting, is again missing.

The move is further evidence of Moore’s increased role with O’Brien for the Flat season. Joseph’s weight problems prompted him to take a first ride over hurdles on Sunday.
