The parents of a dead two-year-old girl have been charged in connection with her death after she was killed by drinking methadone from her baby mug at home, police believe.

Sophie Jones, who was described as a 'beautiful, happy little angel', died of organ failure after paramedics rushed her to hospital at 11.45pm on Tuesday.

Her drug-addicted parents, Michelle King, 29, and Barry Jones, 41, were taken into custody and are due to appear in court today.

Death: Sophie was rushed to hospital on Tuesday evening but could not be saved

Toxicology reports into Sophie's death last night revealed that she had ingested methadone before she died. Although it has not been established whether it killed her, officers continue to investigate the possibility.

The detective leading the investigation said that the drug could not be found in the home and called for it to be returned by anyone who may have taken it away.

Jones and King were charged last night with causing or allowing the death of a child by means of an unlawful act.

They were remanded in custody ahead of an appearance at Blackpool Magistrates' Court.

At a press conference yesterday, Detective Superintendent Paul Withers called for a container methadone, which is suspected to have been taken from Sophie's home, to be returned.

He said: 'We are extremely concerned that a substance may have been removed from the address on Jameson Street either before or shortly after the arrival of paramedics.

'We believe this substance to be methadone and we believe it may have been given to a friend or an associate of the detained persons or hidden in the area near Jameson Street.

'I would like to appeal to the friends and associates of the detained persons, if they know where this methadone is, please ring 101 and help us to recover this substance safely.

'Clearly, if it is found in the area, it can be extremely dangerous and I would urge the public to contact us.

'The cause of death at this time is unascertained and we will not know the cause of Sophie's death until we have the results of the toxicology examinations.'

Two nights ago the pair who were arrested made a secret midnight visit to a hospital mortuary to view the body of a two-year-old-child, who had not been identified.

Three unmarked police cars made the trip from Blackpool Central police station in unmarked constabulary cars for the three mile trip to the town's Victoria Hospital.

One of the investigation team said: 'The female, in particular, has made repeated requests to see the little girl.The two went separately to the mortuary.

'It is unusual but the decision to go ahead was made by a senior officer.'

'Angel': Sophie was taken to hospital late on Tuesday but she could not be saved

Neighbours have spoken of their shock over the death. Sacha Borrie, 28, said: 'I think it's just a tragic accident. Unfortunately, you can't turn the clocks back.'

Ms Borrie, who was at home when emergency services arrived at the house, said: 'I was sat in the living room and then saw these blue lights and all this noise coming from the street.

'I looked out the window and I saw little Sophie being carried into the ambulance.

Ms Borrie described Sophie as 'a real sweetheart'. She said: 'Sophie was as good as gold and she was a happy child.

'She'd come round with her mum and sit and play in my living room. I burst into tears when I heard what had happened.

'She was a gorgeous girl, a beautiful, happy little angel. She had a great little personality.'

Lindsey Holehouse, 21, who lives on the street with her two-year-old daughter, said: 'I feel so sorry for that little girl. Everyone round here is so shocked.'

Flowers, cards and teddy bears left outside the home as a tribute to the 'beautiful princess'.

One card said: 'Princess Sophie, you are now a pretty angel. Spread your wings and fly'.

Another read: 'Sleep with the angels now baby girl.'

Police: Officers are investigating the circumstances surrounding Sophie's death. Two people who were arrested were released without charge but a man and woman remain in custody
