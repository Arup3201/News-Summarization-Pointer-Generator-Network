Edinson Cavani rescued a tepid Paris Saint-Germain performance by scoring a dramatic late winner for the French giants as they beat APOEL Nicosia 1-0 on Tuesday night in a drab Champions League encounter.

The 27-year-old poked the ball past APOEL goalkeeper Urko Pardo in the 87th minute before celebrating with his controversial 'sniper' celebration that led to his eventual dismissal in Friday's Ligue 1 heated victory over Lens.

Laurent Blanc's outfit remain top of Group F a point ahead of Barcelona who beat Ajax 3-1 in the other group tie.

Cavani's goal also extended PSG's unbeaten run to 16 matches in all competitions as they recorded their first back-to-back wins of the season. 

The Uruguayan had toiled all night and appeared to be carrying a knock but was on hand to give the French side an undeserved win that kept them top of Group F on seven points.

Devoid of any cohesion and rhythm going forward, PSG were unable to create a clear goalscoring opportunity all night against a well-drilled and organised APOEL side until Cavani managed to bundle the ball home from close range.

The Cypriot side, who are bottom of the group with one point, will feel they created the better chances during the match to merit a win, but were left to curse their luck as a lack of quality and two goal-line clearances from David Luiz kept them at bay.

The result was a hammer-blow to the hosts, who deserved to get at least a point from the game and possibly more.

APOEL lived up to its reputation of being a hard to beat at home, missing several good chances.

After an uneventful first half, the visitors started strongly after the break with Cavani heading over the bar.

However, the hosts rallied back and if it weren't for the intervention of PSG defender Luiz they would have taken the lead just before the hour mark.

Midfielder Tiago Figueiras Gomes saw his brilliant glancing header cleared off-the-line by the Brazil international. Luiz was soon at it again, this time thwarting Cillian Sheridan's scuffed effort that had beaten Salvatore Sirigu in goal.

Lucas Moura then came close to breaking the deadlock for the visitors following a swift counter-attack. Cavani played the ball into the path of the winger who cut inside the box and saw his left-footed strike just whistle past the post.

APOEL continued to fashion the best opportunities, as both teams made changes, before Cavani broke Cypriot hearts late on.

The £55million striker's goal means the French giants have now scored in all but one of their last 20 matches.
