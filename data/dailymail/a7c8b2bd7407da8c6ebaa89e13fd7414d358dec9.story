Passengers on a packed train were left shocked after an announcer said fat people should not sit down because of a lack of space.

The train was full of commuters when a member of staff reportedly said: 'We are going to be like sardines on this train, so can I ask that only slim people sit on the three-seaters.

'If you are fat then it is simply not going to work.' 

An employee on a busy South West trains told 'slim people' to sit in three seaters but said for 'fat people' it 'simply is not going to work' 

One angry passenger on the service, which was leaving Basingstoke, Hampshire, said: 'I am not necessarily a big person but most people are larger than those seats anyway. 

'It's pretty disgusting. I would get fired if I said that at my work.' 

South West Trains apologised, saying that if the comment had been made it was 'unacceptable' but that the train guard was also being light-hearted. 

A statement from South West Trains said: '

All passengers are welcome on board our trains. Our guard was aware this particular service was very busy and, in a light-hearted way, pointed out that some middle seat spaces might not be comfortable for passengers with a similar build to herself.

'This was in no way intended as a slight on any customers and the majority of passengers on the train took the comments in the spirit in which they were intended. 

'However, like ourselves, she is very sorry if any passengers were offended by her remarks.

'We run some of the busiest trains in the country and we appreciate that space on some of our trains is limited. 

'To provide extra space and seats for our customers, we are in the process of investing £250m in extra carriages and new trains.'
