She made her debut performance in There's A Monster In The Lake at the Rosemary Branch Theatre in 
London on Monday - and last night, Cressida Bonas was back for round two.

Looking
 tanned and relaxed, the 25-year-old was clearly making the most of the 
warm British weather in a festival-inspired boho outfit.

Wearing
 a simple sleeveless white top, flowing floral maxi skirt and her 
trademark Converse, Cressida was seen making her way to the pub after the 
performance.

Ever the professional, the aspiring actress shunned alcohol and was seen sipping on a bottle of Evian water, perhaps to save her voice.

Harry's ex-girlfriend performed in the devilish tale held at the 
award-winning theatre, which is situated above a pub in Islington.

Her

 mother, Lady Mary-Gaye Curzon, turned out for a second night to support
 her daughter in her newfound acting career.

Stylish: Cressida made her debut performance on Monday night and showed no signs of fatigue as she left the theatre after her second performance on Tuesday

On Monday 
night, sisters Isabella Anstruther-Gough-Calthorpe-Branson and Pandora 
Cooper-Key were in the audience, along with close friends Guy Pelly and 
Richard Dinan.

The
 play, which was directed by Lily Ashley, and written by Tallulah Brown,
 follows the tale of an elderly man who, tired of his life in a nursing 
home, enters a fantasy world where he ends up marrying the Queen of the 
Woods.

Cressida 
plays the wolf that guards the way between the two worlds and by all 
accounts is able to stretch her legs as a comic in the role.

Casual and cool: Cressida flashed her toned and tanned legs in her floral maxi skirt as she headed to the pub

And this foray onto the stage is just the first step of what looks to be a promising acting career for the blonde.

Cressida
 has recently signed on to do a movie with Dame Judi Dench and Cara 
Delevingne called Tulip Fever. According to Cara's Instagram, the model 
has been working 15 hour days for the film.

But Cressida's successes have not been bought off the back of her high-profile royal relationship.

Also a patron of the arts, she regularly goes to theatres and productions around London.

Two
 weeks ago she attended a performance of The Colby Sisters Of 
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania at The Tricycle Theatre in London, in which her
 sister Isabella was performing.

the pub after a night's work, which saw her mother, Lady Mary-Gaye 
Curzon, right, turn out for a second night to support her daughter in 
her newfound acting career
