23-year-old cage fighter Ally McCrae with his girlfriend Rachel Sharp.

A young cage fighter who died after being crushed by a cow's carcass in an abattoir was named as Ally McCrae.

The fit 23-year-old mixed martial artist suffered terrible head injuries after becoming trapped underneath the heavy carcass which fell on him in the slaughterhouse in Paisley, Renfrewshire.

It's believed he was washing his hands when the carcass fell from a hook and hit him on the head, triggering a fatal heart attack. He was rushed to hospital but surgeons were unable to save him.

Mr McCrae's headtrainer John 
Nicolson, who works at D-unit gym in Dumbarton, said: 'Ally was such a 
joker and when I heard the bizarre circumstances of the accident 
yesterday, I thought for a second that he might be playing a really 
silly joke.

'It's such a 
tragedy, none of us at the gym can quite believe what has happened. I 
can honestly say he was very talented and was a promising mixed martial 
artist.

'He was always at 
the gym after work and, knowing what happened, it's going to be very 
difficult not having him around. Ally was such a colourful character, he
will be terribly missed.'

Mr McCrae, originally from Kilmarnock, moved to Dumbarton six months ago to be closer to the gym.

The
budding sportsman had been working at the abattoir to fund his training
in mixed martial arts (MMA) but his friends said he dreamt of one day 
having a full-time career from the sport.

The Sandyford abattoir in Paisley was also the scene of a shooting last month

The horror accident happened at the Sandyford abattoir in Paisley, Renfrewshire, just after 1pm on Thursday.

The
gates at the busy abattoir, which sits underneath the M8 motorway a 
mile down the road from Glasgow Airport, remained shut today.

Police and Health and Safety Executive 
(HSE) officials have launched an investigation at the abattoir in 
Paisley, Renfrewshire, the scene of an accidental shooting last month.

An HSE spokesman confirmed that an investigation into the  death was under way.

She
said the inquiry was being led by Strathclyde Police under the 
‘work-related death protocol’ and that HSE inspectors had attended the 
abattoir.

A Strathclyde 
Police spokesman said: ‘A 23-year-old man sustained serious injuries 
after being crushed by the carcass of a cow at Sandyford abattoir in 
Paisley at around 1.05pm. 

'He was taken to the Royal Alexandria Hospital, where he died a short time later.

‘Inquiries into the incident are continuing, the HSE has been informed and is in attendance.’

McCrae was killed when the heavy carcass fell from a hook (file picture)

Last month, a 42-year-old Polish man was shot in the leg when an airgun was fired by accident during a ‘bit of horseplay’ at the abattoir.

At the time, one witness said: ‘It seems the shooting was an accident. Two workers were mucking about and the gun went off.’

The abattoir, on the town’s Sandyford Road, slaughters cattle and sheep for on-site meat wholesalers and individual butchers.

It also kills animals in the halal tradition for Muslim butchers and shops.

A spokesman for the company refused to comment. Labour MP for Paisley Jim Sheridan said: 'It is a very sad thing that has happened.

'There was clearly something wrong with the health and safety at the abattoir and I urge the Health and Safety Executive to conduct a full investigation to make sure this doesn't happen again.'

MSP for West of Scotland Neil Bibby said: 'This is a tragic incident and I would fully support it being fully investigated.'
