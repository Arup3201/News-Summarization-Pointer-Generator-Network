A former middle school music teacher has been jailed for six months after pleading guilty to six counts of statutory rape.

Devri DePriest, 27, was sentenced to six months in jail on Monday after pleading guilty to six counts of statutory rape

DePriest was arrested in October 2011, and indicted in 2012 on 15 counts of statutory rape by an authority figure and one count of sexual battery by an authority figure for having sex with two underage male students.

As part of a deal with prosecutors, she agreed to plead guilty to six counts of statutory rape.

Assistant District Attorney Jayson Criddle, who prosecuted the case, described the result as ‘fair.'

‘She’s going to serve a very significant sentence for somebody who’s never been in jail before, which is nothing to sneeze at. I wasn’t going to agree to anything that didn’t include jail time,’ she told The Tennessean.

DePriest was a music teacher at Rucker-Stewart Middle School, pictured, and also instructed the Gallatin High School band

DePriest’s charges included four counts of statutory rape for having sex approximately 20 times with a 16-year-old boy in 2010 in Hendersonville.

At the time, the boy was a member of the Gallatin High School band, which DePriest, then 25, was instructing. She was also teaching music at Rucker-Stewart Middle School.

Her other charges included 10 counts of statutory rape and one count of sexual battery for having sex with a 17-year-old boy, also a member of the GHS band, in 2009 in Gallatin.

‘I’ve spoken with both (victims) and their families, and they’re satisfied with the outcome,’ said Criddle. ‘They’re relieved to not have to go through a trial.’

DePriest's 10 year probation includes not having access to a computer; using drugs or alcohol; going near areas with children and no contact with minors other than relatives

The terms of DePriest's 10 year probation includes not having access to a computer; using drugs or alcohol; going near areas with children and no contact with minors other than relatives.

She is also required to pay a $1,200 fine and make a $500 donation to Ashley’s Place, a local nonprofit that helps child victims of sexual crimes and abuse.

Her probation deal is also conditional on completing her jail time with good behavior.

DePriest is scheduled to next appear in court on January 6, two days after her release, for approval of her plea deal.
