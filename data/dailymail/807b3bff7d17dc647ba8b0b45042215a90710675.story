Fast bowler Stuart Broad admitted to feeling frustrated as England battled a slow pitch at Trent Bridge on the second day of the first Test against India.

After four wickets for two runs in the afternoon session, the hosts had India 346 for nine and looked like they would remove the tourists for less than 400.

But a 
final-wicket partnership of 111 from Bhuvneshwar Kumar (58) and Mohammed
 Shami (51 not out) held Alastair Cook's men up, with the captain 
departing early as England reached 43 for one at the close.

'It was frustrating, but we tried pretty much everything with the ball,' Broad told Sky Sports 2.

'The
 ball was 50 overs old leading up to the new ball, and it wasn't really 
doing a huge amount. There wasn't much for length, so it was quite hard 
to buy a wicket.

'You were almost hoping for a batsman error and, credit to the 10 and 11 of India, they didn't give us that error, really.

'It
 was frustrating, but actually if you break the day down and the session
 down, it was 90 for four that session. That was actually our best 
session of the game, but we walked off at tea a little bit frustrated.

'It's
 a good pitch to bat on. We stuck to our guns fantastically well - 457 
could have been 600, no question about that. We bowled really well.'

Broad is encouraged, however, that groundsman Steve Birks took the unusual step of apologising for conditions after day one.

'I
 think the best thing that's happened is Trent Bridge have come out and 
said 'Look, our mistake', and apologised for the pitch.

'It's certainly not what England would have asked for, not what Trent Bridge would have hoped for.

'Let's just hope that other grounds don't follow suit.'

Broad is optmistic about England's prospects in the first innings.

'After
 day two of our last Test (at Headingley), I think Sri Lanka had an 
eight per cent chance of winning - and they ended up winning,' the 
seamer said.

'A session in Test cricket can change it. The third day is always the 'moving' day, a huge one for us.

'If
 we can get a good start and build, I'm sure the Indian bowlers won't be
 looking forward to bowling at Ben Stokes coming in at number eight when
 you're a bit tired.

'We can certainly get a big score if we get our heads down.'
