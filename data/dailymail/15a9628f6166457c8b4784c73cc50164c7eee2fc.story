Amanda Knox has announced she will not attend a retrial because she will forever be seen as 'the dark lady who decided Meredith had to die'.

The 26-year-old claims her presence animates the courtroom, detracting from the evidence.

It follows claims by her co-accused and former boyfriend that Italian police tried to bribe him into framing her.

Since overturning a 26-year jail sentence, the American has denied any involvement in the 2007 murder of Leeds University student Meredith Kercher, who was found with her throat slashed in their shared flat in Perugia.

Now living in Seattle, she refuses to answer calls to revisit the evidence at a court Florence.

Distracting: Amanda Knox said her 'every move' distracted the Italian courtroom from the evidence

Knox told the New York Post nobody in the Perugia court cared about what really happened to Meredith.

Branding the court room a 'circus', she claims everybody was more concerned about what she was wearing, how she did her hair or whether she smiled at her parents than the legal proceedings.

In an interview with the Sun on Sunday, she said: 'The fact is that my presence has always been a distraction in the courtroom.

'Every single movement I made, every gesture, every facial expression, was the focus of scrutiny and distracted from the evidence in the case.'

Knox told the paper she had been portrayed during the first trial as 'the dark lady...who decided Meredith was better than me and had to die'.

'Projecting that image justifies in their minds that I would be capable of committing a crime so heinous as this and therefore validates the guilty verdict in the first trial,' she said.

But, she added, finance was also a problem: 'If
it were possible to go to the court and not have to deal with the 
issues of being afraid of being thrown back in prison again for an 
arbitrary reason, or for being able to financially afford it, absolutely I would want to be there.'

Italy's highest criminal court, the Court of Cassation, ruled in March that an appeal court in Florence must re-hear the case against Knox and Raffaele Sollecito for the murder of 21-year-old Meredith Kercher, from Surrey.

Sollecito is due to face a retrial on September 30. But Miss Knox's lawyer revealed last month that she will not return to Italy for the new trial.

The pair were found guilty in December 2009 of murdering Miss Kercher, with Miss Knox sentenced to 26 years in prison and Mr Sollecito 25.

But, after an 11-month appeal in a Perugia court, both convictions were thrown out in October 2011.Prosecutors claimed that Miss Kercher was the victim of a drug-fuelled sex game gone awry.

Hitting back: Raffaele Sollecito, who was accused of murdering Meredith Kercher, says the police's handling of his case was 'incompetent'. He claims he was blackmailed into framing Amanda Knox for the crime

Accused: Sollecito says he refused to comply with what police were suggesting because of his 'fondness' for Knox, pictured, and he wrote a letter from his prison cell to his family insisting he would stand by her

Miss Knox and Mr Sollecito have consistently protested their innocence and claim they were not even in the apartment on the night Miss Kercher died.

Raffaele Sollecito says 'sneaky' officers instigated a string of approaches from a prison guard, other inmates and even his family as he and his American lover were awaiting trial for the 21-year-old's murder in Perugia, Italy.

The Italian added that he feared his lover would succumb to the offer because she was 'out of control'.

But Sollecito, 29, said he refused to point the finger of blame at Knox to save his own skin because he was 'really fond of her'.

Yet he admits he was terrified Knox, who he had been dating for just a week before the 2007 killing, would do a deal to stitch him up because she was 'out of control'.

Tragic: Meredith, 21, was killed in 2007. Sollecito and Knox were both convicted of her murder in 2009 and then cleared

Sollecito claimed detectives told him he would be released immediately if he distanced himself from Knox, saying he should pretend he couldn't remember anything or that he was sleeping in order for the prosecution to catch her.

But Sollecito said in the Daily Mirror: 'They did not persuade me. It was the most sneaky situation. I couldn’t invent anything.'

But he still 'feared Amanda' and added: 'I knew her for a short time, a week, and in reality I did not really know this woman. I was scared because she was out of control at the police station. She had been making crazy statements and everything was just wrong.

'I thought she could make a deal to blame me. I was scared of that.'

Knox was jailed for 26 years and Sollecito for 25 following the trial in 2009.

Italian Sollecito said the first 'deal' was when he was in solitary confinement and came about when he his father tried to speak to the proseuction and was told to pass on the message his son should keep his distance from Knox.

Other family members urged Sollecito to take the deal and free himself, but he refused to be persuaded and wrote a letter to his nearest and dearest vowing to stand by Knox.

Sollecito claimed police then began trying to get him to turn against Knox and that, unless he distanced himself from the American, he would spend the rest of his life in prison.

He claims this message was passed to his family in no uncertain terms.

His father was allegedly approached by a Perugia lawyer offering a similar deal.

Prosecutors claimed that Leeds ­University exchange student Meredith had her throat slashed when a drug-fuelled sex game went wrong.

Her grieving family were devastated when Knox and Sollecito were freed on appeal but vowed to keep Meredith’s memory alive.

25. October 2011  -  After an 11-month appeal both convictions were thrown outMarch 2013 - Italy’s highest criminal court ruled that an appeals court must re-hear the case against Miss Knox and Mr Sollecito

They have kept out of the public eye and refused to read the books that Knox and Sollecito wrote about their 'ordeal'.

But in March the family welcomed news of the retrial and hoped they would finally get answers.

No murder weapon was ever found, DNA tests were faulty and prosecutors provided no motive for murder.

The pair, along with a third man, were accused of killing Meredith when she refused to participate in the sex game at her hillside home.

In a series of confused interviews after their arrest Knox initially claimed to have witnessed the murder and named a local bar owner as the killer.

She later withdrew the statement, insisting it had been made under duress, and said she had been at Sollecito’s student apartment throughout the night – which he confirmed.

The pair met at a classical music concert and became lovers within hours. Meredith was murdered just a week later.

Sollecito said the pair 'were like teenagers in a fantasy romance' but then became friends bonded by the tragedy. The couple were photographed being reunited in New York earlier this year – but he insists there is no romance.

Sollecito is often asked if he wished he had never met Knox. He said: 'No, I don’t think like that. I don’t blame her, it is not her fault this nightmare. It is others.'

And he claimed his own life is 'in limbo', and that he is without a home. He fears he is a target in Italy for those who still believe he and Knox were involved and worries police will try to seek revenge by planting drugs in his car.

Fear: Sollecito, left, said his former girlfriend Amanda Knox, right, was 'out of contol' after their arrest

He has tried to settle in Lugano, Switzerland, and set up a computer software firm – but was kicked out by the Swiss authorities because he failed to disclose details of the murder charges.

Sollecito then went to stay with relatives in the US and even got marriage proposals from female murder trial 'groupies'.

He has now moved to a secret location in the Caribbean, where he is currently trying to establish a business.'

Knox’s lawyers have insisted she will not be at the retrial in Florence and Sollecito said he will wait until after the first of eight scheduled hearings to see 'which way the court is going'.

Victim: The pair were found guilty in December 2009 of murdering Meredith Kercher but after an 11-month appeal both convictions were thrown out in October 2011

Sollecito feels victimised and slammed the police handling of the case, saying everything about the investigation was handled 'wrong' and that officers were 'incompetent' and 'fools'.

Despite his own grievances, he insists he hasn't forgotten the pain of Meredith's family, saying he 'can't imagine their suffering'.

But he urged them to read the case documents and ask questions about what really happened instead of sticking by the 'theory' of what happened.

'If you accept only the prosecution case you will never find what is right and what really happened,' he added.
