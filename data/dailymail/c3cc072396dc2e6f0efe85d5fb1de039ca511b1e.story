Publishing executives are reportedly 'on notice' for allegedly paying Hillary Clinton $14 million for her highly-anticipated memoir which sold just 161,000 copies in its first three weeks.

Sources told the New York Post 'there’s lots of finger-pointing going on at (publisher) Simon & Schuster' over the expensive deal.

Although the publisher sent one million copies of 'Hard Choices' to stores, a low 85,000 were sold in the first week before sales plummeted in the subsequent two weeks. The book hit stores on June 10.

Tough times: Hillary Clinton was reportedly given a $14 million advance for her memoior 'Hard Choices' which has not been selling well

Another insider told the Post that while 161,000 sales for a normal book without such a huge advance would be 'OK', executives are wringing their hands over the former Secretary of State's costly tome.

Clinton reportedly got $8 million for her last book for the publisher, 'Living History,' which sold more than 600,000 in its first week in 2003 and more than 1.15 million copies overall.

To make matters worse, Clinton's new book was bumped from the No. 1 spot on the New York Times best-seller list this week by journalist Edward Klein's 'Blood Feud'.

Klein's book describes the acrimonious alliance between the Barack and Michelle Obama, and Bill and Hillary Clinton. The explosive book, which has soared to the top of Amazon, chronicles the 'deep rivalry' between the political families.

From the beginning, Clinton's book has struggled to gain the necessary traction to meet the enormous expectations in sales thrust upon it by publishers.

Total sales for the book are unavailable, as recent ebook sales have not been disclosed, but roughly 15,000 digital copies of the book were known to have been bought the first week.

When asked about the unexpected unpopularity of 'Hard Choices', a spokesman for publishing company wrote off the memoir's shaky start.

'It will be selling for years — in hardcover, e-book, audio and paperback — and we expect it to be a successful book for Simon & Schuster as well as our many international partners,' Simon & Schuster spokesman Cary Goldstein said according to the NY Times.

Initial sales usually account for 30 percent of a book's total sales, meaning Clinton's book would have needed to sale 300,000 copies in the first week to stay on schedule.

Reader reaction hasn't been quite up to snuff, either.

On Amazon, a large majority of reviewers gave the book one star, with users frequently complaining that the book was a waste of money.

'What a waste of paper. Or for Kindle/Nook readers, screen space. What was Simon and Schuster thinking when they paid her? Not profits for sure,' Virginia resident George V. Caylor commented.

'Too bad kindle books can't be used for toilet paper. One star is five too many for this book. Avoid like a plague,' Cornith, Texas, resident D. L. White said of the book.

'No matter how you feel about Hillary, this book is boring and very poorly written. It's not worth reading unless you need something to put you to sleep,' a user name Richard wrote on June 21.
