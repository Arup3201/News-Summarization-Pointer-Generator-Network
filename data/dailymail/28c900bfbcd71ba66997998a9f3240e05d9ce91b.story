She might not have been flanked by Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge as she was yesterday, but the Queen attracted an equally impressive turnout as she travelled alone to the county of Hertfordshire today.

Opting for a visible lilac coat pinned with a large amethyst and diamond brooch for day two of the Diamond Jubilee tour the monarch was greeted by thousands of cheering fans as she arrived in the market town of Hitchin, where many had stood waiting since the early hours of the morning.

Crowds were packed six or seven deep waving Union Flags and cheering as she passed by shortly before midday, while hundreds of pupils from 24 schools in the area had been bussed in specially for the visit.

The 86-year-old travelled to the town 
by royal train from Nottinghamshire, a county she visited yesterday with
the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.

As she stepped off the platform she was gifted with lavender oil from locally grown plants, 
similar to a gift presented to Queen Victoria  at Hitchin station in 1851.

Tim Hunter, of Hitchin Lavender, whose wife presented the offering said: 'We were very honoured and privileged to meet her Majesty.

'She said that they grow lavender on the royal estate at Sandringham in Norfolk.'.

Meanwhile Stewart
Peter, an oil trader living in the town, had his five-year-old daughter 
Erica perched on his shoulders to get a better view.

He
said: 'I wanted my daughter to see the Queen because there have been 
lots of celebrations, watching the Queen on TV, watching the Queen on 
the river, there’s been lots of coverage but I wanted her to see the 
Queen in person.'

Touching: The Queen was presented with bouquets of flowers from a number of young fans

Many of Hitchin’s shops had shut for 
the day but some, such as banks, remained open, with their staff 
standing in the doorways and windows watching the spectacle of the royal
visit.

Michelle White, 40, from the nearby 
town of Shefford, brought her daughters Amelia, aged three, and Jessica 
who is one next week, to see the Queen.

Mrs
White, whose husband Squadron Leader Craig White, is in Afghanistan 
training the Afghan national police, said: 'I think this is absolutely 
brilliant. I’m a 
royalist through and through and the Jubilee celebrations have been 
fantastic. Anyone who was sitting on the fence is now firmly in the 
royalist camp.'

The Queen's warm welcome from the people of Hertfordshire was repeated 
when she travelled from Hitchin to Stevenage to officially open East and North 
Hertfordshire NHS Trust's new multimillion-pound maternity ward at  Lister Hospital.

Her opening of the facility comes 40 years after the Queen Mother originally opened the hospital.

Hundreds of youngsters were entertained before the Queen arrived by balloon 
sculptors, unicyclists and clowns, and a local band played show tunes, 
creating a carnival atmosphere.

The hospital's new £16.4 million facility has been named the Diamond Jubilee maternity unit.

Infants born this year have been dubbed Jubilee babies by staff at the 
hospital and the Queen met a group of women who had given birth in the 
past few days.

Out of the six new mothers, five had boys and the Queen joked about how the males were dominating the room. Proud mother Jenna Scott-Evans, 27, a building society manager, was 
sitting with her son Stanley, who was born yesterday at 2.15pm.

She said: 'When I went into labour it was Tuesday and the staff said the
Queen was coming but I never thought I would get to meet her. It was lucky he was born when he was, otherwise I probably wouldn't be here. The Queen said to me 'Another baby boy' and we had a laugh about that.'

For the visit the Queen wore a Stewart Parvin lilac double-wool crepe 
shift coat and a lilac, green and yellow floral print chiffon dress with
a matching hat by Rachel Trevor-Morgan.

The final leg will take the Queen to Hatfield House, where a Jubilee tree will be planted in Hatfield Park ahead of a reception and lunch.

Today's visit is the Queen's second official engagement in front of big crowds since the Jubilee weekend when millions gathered in London.

The Duke of Edinburgh did not accompany her on today's tour as he is still recovering from a bladder infection.

Camilla learns of war memorial thefts

While the Queen stepped out alone on day two of the Diamond Jubilee tour The Duchess of Cornwall also went about her official duties without Prince Charles by her side.

The 64-year-old visited the Royal Artillery Memorial in central London to learn about the growing problem of military memorials being vandalised by metal thieves.

Camilla marked the structure, at Hyde Park Corner, with a state-of-the-art forensic signature that can only be seen under UV light dubbed SmartWater.

'War Memorials Trust greatly appreciates the support of 
HRH The Duchess of Cornwall,' said War Memorials Trust director Frances 
Moreton 

Camilla also visited a flower festival at St Mary's Church, Barnes for day two of the Jubilee tour

As part of a new national campaign in Memoriam 2014 is offering SmartWater free of charge to the custodians of the estimated 100,000 war memorials across the UK,  to provide greater protection.

The initiative was launched to coincide with the forthcoming centenary of the First World War.

The duchess was attending as patron of the War Memorials Trust.

War Memorials Trust director Frances Moreton said: 'War Memorials Trust greatly appreciates the support of HRH The Duchess of Cornwall.

'In Memoriam 2014 offers a simple and free way for communities to protect their war memorials.

'It is stimulating a greater awareness and recognition of this unique aspect of our national heritage which will play a significant role in the next few years as the nation turns its attention to commemorating the centenary of World War One.'
