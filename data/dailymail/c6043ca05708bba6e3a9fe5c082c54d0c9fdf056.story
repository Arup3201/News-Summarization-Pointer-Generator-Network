So much has been made of Raheem Sterling and England this week that we are in danger of missing the main point. People have hardly spoken about the fact that he came off the bench, won a free-kick with his ability and helped to change the game and win the three points for England in their Euro qualifier against Estonia.

I know that when you are England manager you can be distracted by the side-shows away from football.

Perhaps that is inevitable in this tournament, with its new qualification format, which means that England are already almost certain to qualify. The main story is unlikely to be about the game — or at least, let’s hope not, as it will mean that England have lost. It is tangential issues that will dominate.

But, from Roy Hodgson’s point of view, he has to ensure that he stays focused on the main thing — the match. Whether Sterling said he was tired or not and however upset or not Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers is about his player being discussed, England still won the game.

And they won it because Sterling came off the bench and won the free-kick that created the goal at a stage when it looked as though England might not score from open play. You could easily spin the situation on its head and say it was good management.

The manager kept him hungry, brought him on, he showed a great attitude and changed the game.

Part of the challenge of being the England manager is that there is a feeling that you are leasing someone’s car. It is not yours and you always have that at the back of your mind as you sometimes have to tread carefully. But when a player is on international duty, he is an England player and the manager has to have the authority to do what he wants.

Essentially, there was nothing wrong with the way Roy dealt with the situation.

Whatever the reason for leaving him out — whether it was Raheem saying he was tired or Roy wanting to play a different way — it produced a result. I know that off-field issues can overshadow what you do with England. I had a similar situation with David Beckham, who was always a focal point for the media, like Sterling is now.

There is one tournament I don’t especially want to see Raheem Sterling in — and that’s the Under-21 European Championship in the Czech Republic next summer.

I know it would be lovely to give it our best shot to win it but my feeling is that established senior England internationals should be resting in the summer.

It is different for players who have won only a few caps in the senior team. Luke Shaw, Calum Chambers, John Stones and Ross Barkley still have things to prove in an England shirt. They should certainly be part of the squad for Euro 2015.

But Sterling, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Jack Wilshere and Phil Jones can justifiably sit it out without anyone questioning their desire or their clubs’ motives. They are established members of England’s first XI.

Remember what the development teams are there to do — to develop established players for the senior team. And those who have already achieved that goal don’t need another summer commitment. They would be better off resting and focusing on Euro 2016.

But you have to keep drawing people back to what is happening on the pitch and I would have focused on that after the game. The kid has come on and affected the game — my word, he affected it — and that is all you can ask of your subs.

What I like about Sterling is his bravery. People might not associate that description with him. But bravery is not all about flying tackles and cut heads; there is bravery on the ball and that counts as well. Sterling has courage to take players on, to try something different and beat people. That is what helped change the game. He will win plenty of free-kicks and penalties because he has quick feet and pace to get in and around the penalty area. It is not like he just does it out wide — he does it in areas that hurt you.

Of course, at QPR we have to come up with a plan for stopping him, which is much easier said than done. It is very difficult to pin down someone like Sterling because the laws of the game have changed in favour of the more skilful players, which is one of the reasons why he will be such an asset for club and country. The only way to contain such a player is to work hard collectively in all areas of the pitch to minimise the space he has.

But it is hard to pin him down because he is so comfortable in a variety of positions, something unusual in such a young player. Whether you play him out wide, just off a front man, at the tip of a diamond or on the edge of the diamond. In the modern game, there’s no need to limit his strengths by defining just one position for him. He can play in a variety of roles and that flexibility marks out a good player. 

Rodgers has been critical of England's treatment of his star players already this season

Even more encouraging for England is that Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Ross Barkley will push him; and Theo Walcott and Andros Townsend can challenge him in wide positions.

At 19, Sterling is far from his peak. He needs to add consistency but, having become a key member of the Liverpool and England teams, he will come on leaps and bounds.

We should be celebrating his talent and, at the end of his career, events of the past week will be long forgotten, no doubt seen as something unimportant. Nurture him and support him and English football has a talent to enjoy. Let’s hope we see much more from him — after the match at Loftus Road, of course.

Manuel Pellegrini won the Premier League but even he might be feeling the pressure if Manchester City do not win at CSKA Moscow on Tuesday night.

It is a massive game for them. The club clearly want to do well in the Champions League and at least see some progress, which would mean a quarter-final or the semis this season. That is what the City fans would be expecting.

If they went out early again, I don’t think Pellegrini would lose his job but he would probably feel he had to win the Premier League to be safe. City have to be aggressive and get six points from this game and the return leg, when CSKA come to the Etihad two weeks later. That would put them back in the frame to qualify and give Pellegrini a chance to do something about City’s poor reputation in Europe.

If there’s one place I would like to be this week it’s the Kop on Wednesday night for the visit of Real Madrid. Champions League football came back to Anfield last month but this feels like the kind of fixture Liverpool fans have been waiting for over the last four years. There isn’t a stadium in the world that will top the atmosphere that night.

This Real Madrid side remind me of their famous Galatico team with all their amazing attacking talent — and this time they have better balance to it, with Luka Modric and Toni Kroos. But Liverpool ought to be inspired for this game. Maybe the passion of the Kop can help them get the result they need to stay in the mix to qualify.
