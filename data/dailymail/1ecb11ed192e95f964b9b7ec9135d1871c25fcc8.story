The parents of Northwestern sophomore Harsha Maddula face fresh heartache as an imminent toxicology report is expected to reveal how he died on the night he went party-hopping with friends.

Current indicators give police reason to believe he was intoxicated on the night he went missing and that his death was an accident, although his family maintain foul play was involved.

'He was a strong swimmer, there's no way he would have drowned like that,' his uncle uncle Vasu Kakollu was reported as saying at his wake at the beginning of October.

At the time of his death, friends of Mr Maddula, who is a 
diabetic, said he did not appear to be inebriated, adding that he rarely 
drank because of his medical condition.

Mr Maddula's body was found in Wilmette Harbor in suburban Chicago days after he went partying on September 21 with friends.

The 18-year-old’s student ID card, cell phone, and wallet were found on his body in Wilmette Harbor in suburban Chicago, university police confirmed.

Mr Maddula, who was a sophomore in the school of Engineering and Applied Science, was last seen leaving an off-campus party in Evanston, Illinois, on September 18th.

A police spokesman said: 'We have interviewed several people and current indicators suggest he was intoxicated.

'We suspect it was an alcohol-related accident or suicide and do not suspect foul play.

'The toxicology report will reveal how much alcohol was in his body and whether he suffered from a chemical reaction due to an existing medical condition when he died.'

More than 20 law enforcement 
agencies, including the FBI, had been searching for the student since 
his disappearance last Saturday, sweeping around Lake Michigan, near the
harbour where his remains were eventually discovered.

The last record from his cell phone was from a tower near Wilmette Harbor around 1am on the Saturday.

Northwestern president Morton 
Schapiro said in a statement: ‘On behalf of Northwestern University, I 
extend our deepest sympathies to Harsha's family and to his many friends
at Northwestern.'

‘Our thoughts are with them,' Mr Shapiro continued. 'The loss
of one member of the Northwestern community deeply affects us all, and 
as we start the new academic year, normally a time of joy and optimism, 
we do so this year with a heavy heart.’

Maddula's parents, Prasad and 
Dhanalakshmi, travelled from their home in New Hyde Park in Long Island 
to the Chicago suburb to meet with school officials and help with the 
search.

Hundreds of volunteers, including family members, officials, and friends of Mr Maddula had helped in the search efforts.

His family put up a 
$25,000 reward for information regarding his return. They said their 
son, a diabetic, was thoughtful and bookish, and not interested in heavy
partying.

Friends, who did not 
want to be identified, told The Daily Northwestern student newspaper that Maddula had 
been party hopping with friends on Friday night.

Maddula left his dorm with eight friends around 10.30pm on the Friday.

Maddula left his dorm with eight friends around 10.30pm Friday.

The
coterie of students arrived at an off-campus party around 11pm, but 
after a half hour or so the group decided to move a house party nearby.

It was when the group arrived at the second event that they realized Maddula was no longer with them.

According to people familiar with the
events that night, a sophomore, Linzy Wager, spoke to Maddula around 
12:35am and he told her that he was back
at his dorm room - but police say surveillance video from his dorm and 
his electronic key access records show that he was not there.

His friends reported him missing at 6:35pm on Saturday, after they couldn't locate him.

Friends and family described the college sophomore as a straight-A student with a big heart.

The school said they are committed to finding the boy, who is of Indian descent, 5 feet 8 inches tall, approximately 150 pounds, with black hair, dark brown eyes.

He was last seen wearing a grey long sleeve sweater with white and black stitching, dark grey pants and brown shoes.
