Economy seats on airplanes are a tight enough squeeze as it is.

And with roughly 64 per cent of adults in the UK classed as  overweight or obese, the size issue is becoming more of a problem on  flights.

As seating on flights appears to get smaller, the population is getting larger, prompting one expert to call for airlines to reflect this with their plane layouts. 

George Hobica says airlines should offer a new class of 'wide' economy seats for those who are larger

George Hobica, founder of airfarewatchdog.com  named 'Best Online Travel Expert' by Money Magazine, has come up with a solution.

He's advocated a new class of 'wide' economy seats to accommodate those who take up more space.

Rather than changing all seating on flights, Mr Hobica is advocating creating two rows of wider seats for obese passengers.

The average economy class airline seat is around 17 inches wide, which Mr Hobica claims can even be too small for people who are of a larger build but don't have a weight issue, causing discomfort for neighbouring passengers. 

Economy seats measure 17 inches wide although many people, including body builders, surpass that

As policy with more airlines stands, they request 'passengers of size' who can't fully lower the arm rest because of their width, to buy an extra seat (although most don't bother) and in extreme cases crew can refuse to let overweight passengers board flights.

George Hobica suggests adding one or two rows of  'economy-class wide' seats to planes instead, similar to the economy comfort seating which is offered by American Airline Delta.

The carrier charges up to $75 (£50) extra each way depending on whether the flight is domestic or international.

For that fee, customers receive up to four inches more legroom and up to 50 per cent more seat recline. 

Mr Hobica said: 'Why not install one or two rows - just four or eight economy seats - in a two-by-two configuration with the standard amount of legroom?

Most airline's irlines policy says 'passengers of size' should buy an extra seat or might be refused to board

'No extra perks - no priority boarding, no free snacks - just extra width, and charge the same that airlines now charge for extra legroom.'

'These seats would be about eight inches wider. If no "passengers of size" needed or reserved them, then the airlines could give them to their frequent fliers at check-in or to lucky passengers by the luck of the draw. This would be a great status perk and solve the spill-over issue.'

In the past, proposals from airline manufacturer Airbus to reduce seat sizes to accommodate new extra-wide seats have enraged passengers. 

64% of UK adults are classed as overweight or obese, making the size problem a growing one on flights

Eighty-four per cent of respondents to a recent survey by Skyscanner said the move would be deeply unfair. 

Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary also caused controversy by suggesting introducing a 'fat tax' for obese passengers, forcing them to pay more.

The outspoken CEO's idea prompted a flurry of surveys to understand whether passengers were in agreement or against the proposal. 

Nearly half of the people asked (48 per cent) in a survey by Holiday Extras felt that overweight passengers should be charged extra to board their flight. 

Men in particular thought those carrying excessive body weight should pay the price, with 51 per cent of men in favour of additional charges compared to 43 per cent of women.
