A pilot flying an historic fighter plane was forced to make a dramatic crash landing in front of thousands of airshow spectators today.

White smoke could be seen coming from the engine of the Royal Navy Historic Flight's Hawker Sea Fury at the Air Day at RNAS Culdrose in Cornwall.

The aircraft, which was in the middle of a display, started to experience problems as it was coming in to land and moments later it hit the runway 'hard' before spinning on to grass in front of stunned onlookers.

White smoke could be seen coming from the engine of the Royal Navy Historic Flight's Hawker Sea Fury as it performed the penultimate display at the RNAS Culdrose Air Day

 The aircraft hit the runway 'hard' at RNAS Culdrose in Cornwall after losing power shortly before touching down. The pilot was forced to make an emergency landing as thousands watched on

The historic aircraft's undercarriage appeared not to come out as it was coming in to land, according to witnesses.It then skidded along the runway prompting a stunned silence among the thousands of spectators

The aircraft eventually skidded to a halt around 100 metres from where it had touched down following its Air Day display. Emergency crews quickly arrived at the scene, but the pilot was able to climb from his cockpit

The crowd fell silent as the plane skidded along the runway, eventually coming to a halt around 100 metres from where it had touched down.

Witnesses reported that the pilot had miraculously  escaped serious injury in the incident and jumped from the cockpit when the plane had come to rest.

He was later praised for his skilled handling of the plane as the drama unfolded in front of crowds of up to 30,000.

The Hawker Sea Fury was the last British propeller-driven fighter to serve with the Royal Navy. 

Although it was developed during the Second World War, the Sea Fury entered service two years after the conflict ended.

Originally it was commissioned for the RAF, but when they cancelled the order, the Royal Navy stepped in seeing it as a suitable carrier aircraft.

Having entered operational service in 1947, it went on to prove popular overseas and was used during the Korean War in the early 1950s.

It attracted international orders as both a carrier and land-based aircraft and was operated by countries including Australia, Burma, Canada, Cuba, Egypt, West Germany, Iraq, and Pakistan.

More than 860 of the planes were built between 1945 and 1955. It was designed to have a top speed of 460 mph and a wingspan of 12 metres.

Several remain airworthy in the present day both as heritage and racing aircraft.

The Royal Navy Historic Flight maintains and flies a small number of aircraft that are important to British Naval aviation.

The organisation provides aircraft for air displays and is not part of the military establishment.

It is staffed by civilians and is based at Royal Naval Air Station Yeovilton, Somerset.

The plane's under carriage appeared not to have come out in time. There was no fire and the plane had come down on the opposite side of the runway from the audience.

Displays were suspended immediately while investigations got underway this afternoon.The exact cause of the problem is not yet known.

This afternoon, RNAS Culdrose tweeted: 'Everyone do not panic. The main thing is the pilot is okay and fire engines are on scene.'

Displays were suspended at RNAS Culdrose while investigations got underway this afternoon. A spokesman for the base said that the pilot was uninjured

Emergency services rushed to the scene, but no fire was reported. The pilot jumped from the cockpit after the plane had come to a halt and is reportedly uninjured following the ordeal

The incident happened during the penultimate display of the annual event this afternoon.

It is thought the aircraft suffered mechanical problems and lost power as it was coming in to land.

According to the The Cornishman newspaper, the pilot, Chris Gotke, made a request to land but then suffered further problems releasing the undercarriage of the plane.

RNAS Culdrose told the thousands of visitors to its Air Day not to panic after the emergency landing

Witnesses described the landing as 'an amazing piece of emergency flying' while others took to Twitter to praise the actions of the pilot.

The Helston base's communications officer Pete Wooldridge told the Cornishman: 'The pilot is fine, he leapt out as soon as the plane came to a halt and he is walking around.

'There is no fire and no one has been hurt. But scheduled events have currently been suspended.'
