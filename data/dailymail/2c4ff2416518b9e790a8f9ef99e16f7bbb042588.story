The absence of Gianluigi Buffon from Italy's team was a major blow for  Antonio Conte's side  before their 2-2 draw in Bulgaria in Euro 2016 qualifying on Saturday.

Buffon was taken ill with flu shortly before the game but the legendary Juventus goalkeeper was seen back in training on Monday as the Azzurri stepped up their preparations for the visit of Roy Hodgson's England in Turin.

The friendly is a repeat of the 2014 World Cup group match which Italy won 2-1 and Conte will want his team to repeat the result as he looks for a response to the draw that kept Italy second in Euro 2016 qualifying Group H.

Croatia lead the standings on 13 points, two ahead of Italy, who like England were left praising a goal from a debutant after the game.

Brazilian-born Eder, a 58th minute substitute, marked his first appearance for Italy with a goal in the 83rd minute to rescue a point for Conte's team. 

But England and Italy failed to qualify from Group D in the World Cup, which resulted in a managerial change for the Azzurri as Conte replaced Cesare Prandelli.

And Conte could be tempted into rotating his squad for the visit of England, with Southampton's Graziano Pelle potentially starting while Eder could get his second cap after marking his first  with a goal.
