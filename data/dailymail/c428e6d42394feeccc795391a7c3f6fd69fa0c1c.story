Shares in the global cruise firm that owns the Costa Concordia fell 21 per cent today, wiping nearly £1billion from its market value.

Analysts have suggested that the disaster off Giglio, Tuscany, could reduce the company's profits by a tenth this year.

The timing of the fatal sinking could not be worse for the business, as January to March is the so-called 'wave season' - accounting for about a third of all bookings.

Disaster: At least six people were killed after the Costa Concordia, owned by Carnival Corporation plc, ran aground off the island of Giglio, Tuscany

Investigation: The fatal crash saw £1billion wiped of Carnival Corporation's market share this morning

Carnival Corporation & plc, which owns the Costa Cruises business in which the stricken Concordia operates, is the world's largest cruise ship operator. It owns 11 brands, including P&O, Cunard and Princess Cruises.

It is a dual-listed company, with headquarters in Southampton in the UK and Miami in the U.S.

It can trace its origins back to the Peninsular & Oriental Steam Navigation Company, which was founded in 1822 by Brodie McGhie Willcox, a London ship broker.

Carnival Corp & plc was formed in 2002 when Carnival Corp, the U.S. side of the business, controversially merged with P&O Cruises plc.

In its last update, Carnival Corp & plc recorded profits of £141million in the quarter ending November 30, down from £162million a year earlier.

From its humble beginnings as an Italian family firm, Costa Cruises has risen to become Europe's top cruise operator.

But it has been plagued by a history of accidents and scandal aboard its 15 ships.

One collision caused the deaths of three crew members, while a near-miss prompted an investigation into the company and its safety record.

And in 2008, the Costa Concordia itself hit the dockside in Palermo, Sicily, in bad weather - causing damage to the bow, though no one was hurt. It is not known whether the same captain was sailing it.

More seriously, the Costa Europa crashed in 2008 as its captain tried to dock at Sharm el-Sheikh in Egypt in high winds, killing three crew and injuring four passengers.

At the time, an unnamed maritime official blamed '100 per cent human error', but Costa insisted bad weather was the cause.

Later that year, power failure was blamed for the Costa Classica smashing into a cargo vessel in China's Yangtze River, injuring three people.

The cruise line has also been plagued by reports of ineffective equipment and scandal.

In 2008, the Costa Atlantica developed steering problems. Separately, a crew member was arrested on a charge of possessing and importing child pornography.

The following year, the cruise line was fined £23,000 for deceptive advertising and there was a near-mutiny on the Costa Europa over engine problems.

There was also a fire on the Costa Romantica in the generator room which led to 1,429 passengers being evacuated.

Costa's safety record was called into question after a near-miss in the Channel in 2008.

The crew of the Costa Atlantica almost collided with a car transporter and was criticised by the UK Marine Accident Investigation Branch in an official report for failing to obey the waterway's strict two-way traffic system.

Costa began as a cargo shipping firm but carried passengers from 1947. In 2000 it was bought by Carnival Corporal.

The firm owns a combined fleet of more than 100 ships, has a 49 per cent share of the total worldwide cruise market and made £1.3billion profit last year.
