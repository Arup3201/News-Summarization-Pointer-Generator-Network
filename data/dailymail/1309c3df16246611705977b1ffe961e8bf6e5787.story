She might be the world's newest monarch but Spain's Queen Letizia clearly hasn't let her style standards slip since taking on the top job.

Fresh from a month-long break in Mallorca with her husband King Felipe, 46, she cut an elegant figure as she welcomed President Juan Carlos Varela and his wife to the Zarzuela Palace in Madrid.

True to sartorial form, 41-year-old Letizia plumped for a simple white dress embroidered with seed pearl flowers, which she wore with a chic pair of nude patent court shoes and a matching pair of pearl drop earrings.

Also looking elegant was Lorena Castillo de Varela, Panama's first lady, who opted for a tiered mint-green gown but like Letizia, kept her hair and make-up simple.

Not to be outdone, both husbands wore dapper suits, with King Felipe accessorising his with a salt-and-pepper holiday beard - a new look for the usually clean-shaven royal.

Following their meet-and-greet on the steps of the Zarzuela Palace, the two couples enjoyed a private lunch before the Panamanian president continued on to a meeting with Spanish prime minister, Mariano Rajoy.

Although the Spanish royal couple remained at the palace, the visit is the first of an action-packed schedule planned for the next month, including a visit to New York.

Back to work: Following a month off in Mallorca, the Spanish royals have returned to a packed schedule

There, the Spanish king will address the UN General Assembly in a bid to secure one of the seats on the Security Council for Spain.

The high-powered address is a far cry from the simple pleasures of the past month, which has seen the royal couple enjoy a lengthy holiday on the island of Mallorca where they have a home.

Along with their two daughters, Leonor, Princess of Asturias, and Infanta Sofía, the pair spent August enjoying the beautiful island, although the family did make one official visit to the newly UNESCO listed Sierra Tramuntana mountains.

Since returning to the Zarzuela Palace, their schedule has swiftly filled up with today's visit following hot on the heels of a trip to the new Picasso museum in the city of Malaga on Sunday.

Lots to do: Later this month, the couple will travel to New York so Felipe can make a speech to the UN
