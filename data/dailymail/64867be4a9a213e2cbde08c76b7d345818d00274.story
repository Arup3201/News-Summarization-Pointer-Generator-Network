When the country basked in temperatures warmer than the Mediterranean  earlier this month, it seemed spring had finally sprung.

But just two weeks later, the weather is not so much balmy as barmy.

Villagers woke yesterday to discover two inches of snow in rural  Shropshire, while blizzards caught walkers and cyclists by surprise on the Cumbrian Pennines.

Flurries: Mark Shackleton works at the Dartmoor Brewery in Princetown, Devon - the highest brewery in the British Isles, which is around 1,450ft above sea level, and took some photos of the snow falling last night

Unusual scene: Mr Shackleton said he had only previously seen snow in Princetown, Devon, in the 1990s

And in Devon – where businesses are 
turning their thoughts to the summer tourist trade – snow  flurries gave
 villages a winter  wonderland theme.

The scenes prompted Ladbrokes to slash the odds of snow falling over the bank holiday weekend.

Elsewhere, Devon and Cornwall were 
lashed by 65mph gales which caused power cuts, ripped slates from roofs 
and felled trees and telephone lines, while parts of Carmarthenshire 
were soaked with three inches of rain – a month’s worth in just one day.

Blizzards also fell over Wales as the 
unseasonal conditions swept north east towards the Pennines and 
Newcastle upon Tyne.

The miserable weather was a far cry from the May 
Day weekend, when temperatures peaked at 22C (71.6F) at Heathrow and 
Doncaster – a degree higher than parts of the Mediterranean.

Yesterday Polly Smith, who lives near 
the village of Newcastle-on-Clun in Shropshire, said she was shocked to 
see snow covering her car and garden when she pulled back her bedroom 
curtains.

‘We’ve been here 28 years and it is the first time we’ve had 
snow in May,’ she said.

Several roads in the county were also 
closed due to flash flooding.Around 1,800 homes around Penzance, 
Cornwall, were hit by power cuts caused by fierce winds.

Forecasters said the snow was caused 
by very wet and windy weather in the affected areas, combined with 
cooler than normal temperatures after sunset.

The Met Office said the last widespread snowfall in May was on May 17, 1955, when it covered much of England and Wales.

Downfall: These unseasonal scenes were witnessed as up to 2in of snow was reported in Princetown, Devon

Helen Chivers, from the Met Office, 
said: ‘Over the higher fells we would expect to see snow falling on 
between two to four days in May. It’s fairly rare but it’s not 
exceptional.’

The wet and windy weather is expected 
to continue today and tomorrow, with conditions likely to remain 
unsettled into next week.The Environment Agency said 16 flood alerts 
remained in place yesterday across Wales, the Midlands, the South East 
and South West.

Temperatures are likely to remain 
slightly below the May average of 16C (61F) in the North, and only 
marginally better further south.

÷ Last month was the joint coldest 
April since 1989, averaging a temperature of 6.3C (43.3F), according to 
the Met Office. It shares the dubious honour with April last year.'
