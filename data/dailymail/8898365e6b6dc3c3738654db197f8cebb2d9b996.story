Motorway service stations may be forced to advertise the prices their rivals charge for fuel, under Government plans to clamp down on ‘rip-off’ charges.

David Cameron has ordered a review of motorway fuel prices after an Office of Fair Trading report this year found they were significantly higher than at normal petrol stations.

The study in January found that petrol prices on the motorway are 7.5p per litre higher than on the average forecourt. Diesel prices are an average 8.3p per litre higher.

Petrol stations on motorways could be forced to advertise the fuel prices of near rivals in a bid to stop drivers being ripped off

The Office of Fair Trading found it cost £72.20 to fill a car with petrol from a motorway services station, compared to £66.70 from a supermarket

Ministers are interested in learning lessons from France, which forces service stations to advertise their rivals’ prices to boost competition.

Government sources said Mr Cameron had asked the Downing Street policy unit to investigate options for bringing prices down.

‘The Prime Minister has asked the policy unit to prioritise cost of living issues,’ a source said.

‘This is one area where we believe transparency can drive down prices and give motorists a better deal.

‘The problem on the motorway is that the fuel prices are only advertised on the forecourt.

‘That is the legal requirement. But by the time you’ve pulled off the motorway and stopped, it is often more trouble than it’s worth to go on to the next service station, particularly as you’ve got no idea whether it will be any cheaper.’

The policy review has been ordered by David Cameron, who is on a three-day visit to the United States where he yesterday held talks with President Barack Obama

The OFT report found that higher costs could only partially explain the inflated fuel prices found on motorways, where drivers are often unable to look for a better deal.

The study suggested that the lack of transparency about prices on the motorway was a potentially significant factor in the higher charges.

The Downing Street policy unit has now drawn up a series of options for reform.

As a minimum, service stations are likely to be required to advertise their fuel prices at the roadside, so that drivers can make a decision before they pull off.

The Department for Transport has also been asked to investigate whether Highways Agency signs could be used to display information about fuel prices on the motorway.

And officials will consider whether to copy the French model that requires service station operators to advertise the prices of their rivals. Under this option, operators could be forced to display not only their own prices, but also those of the next two service stations on the motorway.

The Office of Fair Trading said sharp rises in fuel prices was cause by increases in tax and not price-fixing by oil companies

Pre-tax petrol prices in the UK are amongst the lowest in Europe, the OFT said

The prices would be shown on the motorway, giving drivers the option of continuing to the next service station if it is offering a better deal.

A formal consultation on the issue is likely to be issued by the DfT later this year.

Although the reforms will not force operators to cut their charges, ministers believe the increased transparency should drive down prices.

The review is part of a wider drive within Government to tackle the soaring cost of living, which ministers fear will be a major issue at the next

election.

Mr Cameron is also under pressure from his own MPs, who have identified fuel prices as the single biggest cost of living concern.

The RAC last night welcomed the initiative and called for it to be expanded to include service station food.

RAC spokesman Pete Williams said motorway drivers had ‘long been victims of some pretty indefensible pricing’.

He added: ‘This is welcome news for motorists and commercial drivers alike but we still need motorway services to be transparent and fair on all their prices.  They have held the motorist to ransom for far too long.’
