A man who was found stabbed to death alongside his partner in their Queensland home, where a five-year-old boy was found unharmed, was a convicted paedophile who served two jail terms.

Corey Croft, 43, spent almost seven years behind bars for child sex offences that he committed in both South Australia and Queensland, including an incident in which he had sex with a five-year-old while recording the crime, the Gold Coast Bulletin reports.

He and his partner, Renee Carter, 39, were found dead in their Upper Coomera home on the Gold Coast on Wednesday. Ms Carter's five-year-old son was found wandering the family home on Skylark Street just after 5.30pm by his aunt who located the two bodies, and is believed to have been inside the house for an entire day before the gruesome discovery.

Corey Croft, 43, who was allegedly murdered in his Upper Coomera home on Tuesday, was a convicted paedophile who served two jail terms. In 1995 he was imprisoned for having sex with a five-year-old while recording the crime

Ms Carter's ex-husband Christopher Robert Carter, an Afghanistan war veteran and the father of a number of the deceased woman's children, has been charged with murdering the pair.

Superintendent David Hutchinson told the Gold Coast Bulletin that Croft, formerly known as Corey Krawtschenko, had changed his name following his convictions.

However, he said investigators had ruled out that his former offences where the motive behind his alleged murder.

Croft first served four and a half years in prison after videotaping himself sexually assaulting a five-year-old child in 1995.

He moved to Queensland after his release, where in 2007 he was sentenced to another year and four months behind bars for possessing child pornography.

The revelation of Croft's former offences has led advocacy groups to protest against the legal loopholes that allow sex offenders to change their names and essentially hide their past.

It comes as the five-year-old boy, who was found unharmed and wondering the same house in which Croft and his mother had been killed, was revealed to have no comprehension that he will see his parents again.

'Mummy and Daddy are dead and there's blood everywhere,' the child told his neighbours, Nepia and Megan Kino, according to The Courier Mail.

'I'm going to take them to hospital to fix their cuts so they can get better.  

Mr Carter's son, a five-year-old boy who was also the son of Ms Carter, was found unharmed and wandering the home he shared with the victims. Police say the house will remain a crime scene for at least a week

Mr Carter is a member of the Australian Defence Force and has served on at least one tour of Afghanistan

 Police believe the boy was asleep at the time and are confident he did not witness the deaths. He did however spend the following day in the home with his parents' bodies

Police believe the victims were stabbed to death in the home at around 8pm on Tuesday evening. 

Carter briefly appeared at Southport Magistrates Court on Thursday but didn't speak or show any emotion.

He had been divorced from the mother of the five-year-old boy  for seven years.

Regional crime co-ordinator Detective Superintendent David Hutchinson said a knife was used in the double murder of Ms Carter and Mr Croft and that the woman's sister found the pair when she visited the house after being unable to make contact.

Police are now searching another premises for possible bloodied clothing and have appealed for anyone who saw a white 1999 model Mitsubishi Pajero four-wheel drive in the area over the last week to come forward 

Detective searched another premises for possible bloodied clothing and a public toilet block near the accused's home. 

They have appealed for anyone who saw a white 1999 model Mitsubishi Pajero four-wheel drive in the area over the last week to come forward.

Following the gruesome discovery, the boy was consoled outside his home by a detective   dressed in a blue forensic suit, believed to be used when someone may have evidence on their body, the Gold Coast Bulletin reports.  

Supt. Hutchinson said the boy was not involved in the fatal incident and was unharmed. He is being cared for by relatives after speaking with police.

'You would understand that a five-year-old child being inside the house under those circumstances would have to be very traumatic,' Supt Hutchinson said.

'You've just got to hope at the end of the day that he's young enough to minimise the impact on him.' 

Police set up an extensive crime scene in Skylark Street, Upper Coomera, and are now seeking wotnesses who saw a white Mitsubishi Pajero in the area over the last week

Police confirmed a little boy with blonde hair was found alone in the house by his aunt who located the bodies of her sister and brother-in-law and hinted that the boy may have witnessed the alleged murders

A neighbour said he heard arguing coming from the family home on Tuesday night but it stopped when he went to investigate. 

It's believed the family signed a lease on the home six months ago.

Tony Smales, another neighbour, told the Gold Coast Bulletin the household was the most family-orientated on the street.

'They had the entire place lit up for Christmas with giant Santas and reindeer, so it just blows you away to see something like this happen,' he said. 

Carter made no application for bail and has been remanded in custody.

The matter has been adjourned until March 27.
