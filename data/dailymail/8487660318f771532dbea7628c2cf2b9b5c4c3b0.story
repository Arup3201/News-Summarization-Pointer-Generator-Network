A nursery worker may lose her job after she was spotted taking part in the Commonwealth Games opening ceremony while on sick leave, it emerged today.

Amy McIntosh had been signed off work for several weeks when her bosses caught her on TV dancing as a giant Tunnock's tea cake during the celebrations in Glasgow.

The 25-year-old had signed up to be a volunteer for the Games, but did not ask for time off for rehearsals, which began three weeks ago.

Ms McIntosh is now understood to be facing a crunch meeting with her bosses at the Woodlands Day Nursery in Houston, Renfrewshire.

A source at Woodlands Day Nursery said: 'We couldn't believe it when we saw her.' 

The source added that she must have been at rehearsals during the time that she said she was too ill to work.

Ms McIntosh, from Erskine, confirmed to the Sun that she had been off sick at the time of the ceremony, it is believed with tonsillitis.

She says she has been 'signed off sick' by a doctor and has a referral for the hospital.

But the source at the nursery where Ms McIntosh works said that she would have been given time off to take part in the opening ceremony, if only she had asked.

'If she came to us, we would have let her have time off. We are very much for the Commonwealth, very much for Scotland.'

She said that all members of staff were 'caught up' in the excitement of the Games, especially because it was being held so close by.

The source said: '[Amy] was playing the system by taking time off and getting sick pay as well. She was letting the whole team down.'

The opening ceremony for the 20th 
Commonwealth Games was watched by some 9.4million viewers at the height 
of the celebrations last Wednesday night.

As well as the Tunnock's tea cake, the £20million ceremony featured a giant haggis, cabers, golf clubs, a gay wedding, 41 Scottish terriers and Rod Stewart as well as other Scottish inventions such as the television and Sherlock Holmes.

After the ceremony, Ms McIntosh's friends praised her on her Facebook page, with one saying that she was 'shining bright like the star that you are.'
