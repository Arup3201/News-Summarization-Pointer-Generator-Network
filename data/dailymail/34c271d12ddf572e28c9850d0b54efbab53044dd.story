European governments are accused of becoming one of Al Qaeda's biggest donors because of the huge ransoms they pay for hostages.

The terror group and its affiliates netted an alleged £73million in just six years from the payments - which are cloaked in secrecy and denied by the governments accused of making them.

Leading the way was France which paid a record £24million for four hostages who were freed in October last year, according to a major investigation by The New York Times.

The leader of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula has even described kidnappings as 'an easy spoil' giving swift income to his terror network.

'Thanks to Allah, most of the battle costs, if not all, were paid from through the spoils,' the newspaper quoted him as saying.

'Kidnapping hostages is an easy spoil, which I may describe as a profitable trade and a precious treasure.'

The most prominent case - involving by far the most money - was that of four French nuclear firm employees who stunned the world when they were returned unharmed after three years in captivity. 

Pierre Legrand, Thierry Dol, Daniel Larribe and Marc Feret were captured in September 2010 while working on a uranium mine in northern Niger.

Their touchdown at a military airport near Paris in October, where they were met by President Francois Hollande, prompted world headlines amid claims a heavy price had been paid.

Difficult choices: The U.S. insists it does not negotiate with terrorists, but there can be heavy consequences. This video released in 2004 shows American hostage Eugene Armstrong before he was beheaded by militants

Victim: Jack Hensley, a U.S. contractor working in Iraq, was also beheaded by kidnappers in 2004 who said they were part of the Al Qaeda-allied group Tawhid al-Jihad. Scores of westerners have been abducted

The French government insisted it used diplomacy to free the four men, with Defence Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian saying: ‘France has held the same position for the past three years - we don’t pay.'

But the French newspaper Le Monde, renowned for its secret service contacts, reported the country's intelligence agencies paid 20million Euros (£17m) for their release.

Today's investigation puts this figure far higher - at 30million Euros (£24m) which it is claimed was paid by a state-owned company.

FRANCE   £34m

QATAR AND OMAN   £12m

SWITZERLAND   £7.3m

SPAIN   £6.5m

AUSTRIA   £1.9m

SOURCE NOT KNOWN   £13m 

The New York Times also claims France paid Al Qaeda 12.5million Euros (£10m) in 2011 to free three hostages from France, Togo and Madagascar.

The total - £34million - means France's payments were almost triple those of the next-highest payer, Qatar and Oman (£12m).

Switzerland also paid £7.3m, Spain paid £6.5m and Austria paid £1.9m, while the source of another £13m in ransom money could not be determined.

Reporter Rukmini Callimachi collated the figures by interviewing former hostages, negotiators, diplomats and government sources in 10 countries.

The reporter also uncovered thousands of pages of internal Al Qaeda documents which lay out the terror network's approach to kidnapping westerners.

They chime with repeated warnings by the U.S. government that ransoms are now terrorism's second-biggest source of income.

David Cohen, U.S. Treasury under-secretary for terrorism, claimed Al Qaeda was not the only group profiting - others include Boko Haram in Nigeria and al-Shabaab in Somalia, Nigeria and Kenya.

Joy at a price: Daniel Larribe, one of the four French hostages, celebrates with his family last October

In a speech last month he said there had been a decline in wealthy donors bankrolling terror groups so they were relying on kidnappings instead.

'Aside from state sponsorship of terrorism, ransom payments are the greatest source of terrorist funding today,' he warned.

'Groups such as Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, Boko Haram, and al-Shabaab have collected tens of millions of dollars in ransoms in the past several years. 

'These ransom payments are used to fuel the whole cycle of terrorist activities, including inflicting indiscriminate harm.

'Improving the international effort against kidnapping-for-ransom is an urgent challenge.' 

The U.S. insists neither the White House nor Britain have paid terrorists. But despite the claim, the amount Al Qaeda can charge for ransoms has allegedly soared to £6million a head.

It even 'outsources' its operations to criminal gangs who take a cut from the ransom when it is paid.

In one case, Al Qaeda offered to free a British hostage who was captured in Mali in 2011 - if Britain agreed to release the radical preacher Abu Qatada into an 'Arab Spring' country.
