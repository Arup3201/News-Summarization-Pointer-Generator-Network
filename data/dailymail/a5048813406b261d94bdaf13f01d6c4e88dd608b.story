The NFL’s first openly gay player has signed his rookie contract.

Defensive end Michael Sam inked the historic multimillion dollar deal Saturday with the St. Louis Rams just over one month after the team made him the 249th overall pick in the 2014 NFL Player Draft.

Sam, 24, said on Twitter that he is ‘grateful [and] humbled’ by the opportunity to sign with the team’s other 10 draft picks and play in the NFL just after agreeing to the deal.

The Rams will pay Sam $2.65 million during the four-year contract, with $46,000 guaranteed, Fox Sports reported.

The players were put through team-mandated financial planning education prior to being signed, according to the network.

All picks agreed to deals within the slots mandated by the league for draft picks, virtually eliminating contract negotiations that led to current Rams quarterback Sam Bradford receiving a six-year, $78million contract with a nearly $18million signing bonus and $50million guaranteed after the team drafted him in 2010.

‘With the new rookie cap and everything it's really not difficult to get the deals done,’ coach Jeff Fisher explained.

‘So we just felt like this time would be better served, putting them in the situations from an educational standpoint, financial planning and those kinds of things. We've done a lot of that.’

The organization announced all the players signed in a tweet with a picture of their 11-man rookie class.

Sam followed that up by also tweeting out the same picture and writing: ‘Grateful, humbled, and motivated after officially signing with all my Rams rookie brothers. Let's do this!!’

The 2013 SEC Co-Defensive Player of the Year is believed by many to have fallen all the way to the final round of the draft because he came out during a series of interviews earlier this year.

‘I understand how big this is,’ he told ESPN in February. "It's a big deal. No one has done this before. And it's kind of a nervous process, but I know what I want to be... I want to be a football player in the NFL.’

He was initially projected to be a third or fourth-round draftee, but tumbled to the seventh round and was selected only eight places ahead of the final pick – which is sarcastically referred to as Mr Irrelevant.

The All-American famously cried, embraced and kissed boyfriend Vito Cammisano on national television shortly after his selection was announced.

‘Thank you to the St. Louis Rams and the whole city of St. Louis. I'm using every once of this to achieve greatness!!’ He wrote in a tweet that day.

Despite having a dominant senior season at the University of Missouri, many scouts panned Sam’s NFL potential prior to the draft.

They said the six-foot-two-inch, 261-pound player was too small to play his natural defensive end was too small to play on the line, and that he was too slow to play linebacker.

If comments made during his first press conference were any indication, the criticism did little to dent Sam’s confidence.

‘I’m determined to be great,’ he said.
