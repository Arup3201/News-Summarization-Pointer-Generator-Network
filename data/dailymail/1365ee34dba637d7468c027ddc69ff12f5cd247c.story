An Arlington woman was saved from being attacked with a metal baseball bat when her children wrestled the crazed assailant to the ground.

According to police reports, officers responded to an assault call at roughly 6 p.m. on the 2400 block of S. Lowell St.

Kendra Owens, 27, had repeatedly struck neighbor Jennifer Robinson with the bat.

Kendra Owens attacked neighbor Jennifer Robbins with a metal bat, and was only stopped when Robbins' children wrestled her to the groun

Luckily for Robinson, her children came to her aide - taking the bat from the neighbor and hitting Owens with it.

Both women were then transported to a local hospital.

Robinson declined to speak herself, instead letting attorney Deborah Kane make a statement to NBC Washington.

'She was extremely traumatized,' Kane said. 'She just underwent eye surgery [Wednesday]. She currently has a tube in her eye.'

Kane continued: 'They were there while the attack was going on and 
her son, particularly, tried to get in the way to defend her and help 
her.'

Robbins had to receive emergency surgery on her eye which now has a tube inserted in it

According to police, the fight was the result of a long-standing feud.

'Weâ€™ve been called out to that area before for disputes, issues 
amongst them, but it never escalated to this type of physical 
altercation,' said Dustin Sternbeck of the Arlington County Police.

Owens now faces malicious wounding charges.
