A Father has been arrested in connection with the death of his six-year-old daughter.

Ben Butler, 33, was being questioned by police yesterday after Ellie suddenly collapsed and died at their family home in Surrey.

Officers said they were treating the death as ‘unexplained’ and that investigations were ongoing.

Emergency services were called to the family’s three-bedroom flat in Sutton on Monday afternoon.

Ellie, who lived there with her father, a former removal man, mother Jennie Gray, 32, an artist, and sister, was taken to hospital but was pronounced dead a short time later. Within hours Mr Butler was arrested and was still being held in custody last night.

Neighbours described how Mr Butler watched as paramedics  tried to revive Ellie, who was  only half-dressed, for 15 minutes  as he cradled his other daughter in his arms.

Melanie Hutson, 25, a waitress, said: ‘The paramedics came  out first with Ellie. She was on  a stretcher.

‘She had her pyjama bottoms  on but no top. They took her  down to the ambulance on the ground floor.

‘There was about six of them there trying to revive her. One was pumping on her chest.

‘Her father was walking behind carrying his other daughter. 

'You could tell he was in a right state. He just looked completely shocked.

He was white as a sheet. ‘He wasn’t saying anything,  just looking at the ambulance staff. He was about 10ft away. I’ve never seen a look like that on someone’s face before.’

The neighbour said there was no sign of the girl’s mother, adding: ‘I’m guessing she must have been out or in the house because she wasn’t there the whole time.’

A close member of her family, who did not want to be named, paid tribute to a ‘bright, beautiful girl’.

They said: ‘She was such a  bouncy, bright and beautiful child, we can’t believe she has gone. We are all devastated.

‘She was a wonderful little  girl who was loved by everyone  at school.’

Ellie’s grandfather, Neal Gray,  67, said: ‘I only found out about all of this yesterday. It is still very raw for me.’

No sign: Ellie's mother Jennie Gray, above, was not seen in the aftermath of the incident

Officers from the Met’s homicide and major crime command are investigating the circumstances.

They confirmed a 33-year-old man had 
been ‘arrested in connection’ with the inquiry but refused to say what 
he had been arrested on suspicion of.

A police spokesman said: ‘Enquires 
continue into the circumstances of the death which at this early stage 
is being treated as unexplained.

Ongoing probe: Police are still investigating the incident and a post-mortem examination is due to be held on Thursday

Forensic investigators today carried out an in depth search of the estate where the family live

‘A 33-year-old man has been arrested 
in connection with  this investigation and remains  in custody at a 
south London  police station.’

A Scotland Yard spokesman added later 
yesterday: ‘A warrant for further detention  has been issued to give 
officers  further time to question the  suspect. That expires at 
midnight tonight.’

Forensic experts sealed off  the area and have searched the home on the Shanklin Estate and bins nearby.

A post-mortem examination into the cause of the child’s death is due to be carried out today.

'Rest with the angels': Neighbours have already begun to leave tributes to the six-year-old outside the family home

Tributes to the youngster were left outside the family home. One read: ‘RIP Ellie, sweet dreams.’

Another read: ‘RIP Ellie, rest with the angels.’

Another neighbour described Ellie as a ‘sweet little girl’ who was ‘really nice and friendly’.

She added: ‘She would also say hello, always smiling.’

The thorough forensic investigation lasted several hours. Two officers can be seen looking through rubbish bags
