You may just be getting to grips with the concept of 3D cinema.

But it appears that technology is already outdated.

Britain’s biggest cinema chain is now preparing to unveil the UK’s first 4DX theatre, which features water sprays, gusts of air, fog and strobe lighting inside the auditorium to simulate the weather and scenes on screen.

The new Cineworld multiplex in Milton Keynes will also feature moving seats which shake from side-to-side, up and down and rock backwards and forwards, and which are synchronised with the film’s action.

Other effects include pumping out bubbles to ‘bring to life the buoyant atmosphere of the scene’.

Different scents recreating explosives and coffee are also pumped into the movie theatre, while the seats are equipped with a ‘tickler’ – a small brush that swipes the back of viewers’ legs and which is designed to help bring the audience closer to the drama.

Large fans are used to create wind effects ranging from turbulent storms to gentle breezes, while small jets of water are sprayed from the back of seats in front of audiences to simulate rain.

The cinema will open on January 30 after taking five months to complete. It includes 140 seats and a curved screen measuring 5.8m x 10.5m – bigger than a double decker bus.

The first film to be screened at the cinema will be spy thriller Kingsman: The Secret Service.

The Cineworld cinema in Glasgow was the first UK multiplex to experiment with ‘immersive cinema’ techniques when it installed 35 vibrating seats into its auditorium in 2012.

It is now hoped that more 4DX cinemas, which have been created by South Korean company CJ 4DPlex, will be rolled out across the country in the next two years.

Tickets will cost from £13.40 for a standard adult single and £14.90 to watch a 4DX film in 3D.

The world’s first 4DX cinema was launched in January 2009 in Seoul, South Korea, and featured a showing of blockbuster sci-fi, Avatar.

The technology has since been installed in around 150 theatres across 30 countries including China, Vietnam, Thailand and Mexico, with CJ 4DPlex hoping to have opened more than 1,000 4DX cinemas around the world by the end of next year.

The first 4DX theatre in the US was opened at the LA Live auditorium in Los Angeles last year. There are currently around 30 films each year which are screened in 4DX cinemas.

While cinema-goers have mostly been impressed by the technology, some have reported feeling sick and being left damp after watching box office hits such as Pirates Of The Caribbean.

And there were reports of people becoming nauseous and going temporarily deaf after watching Transformers: Dark Of The Moon, where the major smell was the scent of burnt rubber and explosives.

Talking about the 4DX technology, the company say: ‘Movies are now no longer bound by their visual and aural limits.

'4DX is the next step in the movie-going evolution taking audiences on a journey into the full feature film. Free yourself from the confines of the flat screen and live the experience with 4DX.’

Mooky Greidinger, Cineworld Chief Executive Officer says: ‘We are incredibly excited to be bringing this revolutionary cinematic experience to the UK.

‘Cineworld Milton Keynes will be our first location among many others to come. In 4DX, cinema-goers will become part of the action as sounds, motion, lights and special effects thrill them in their seats.

‘At Cineworld, we are committed to differentiating ourselves – ensuring we are at the forefront of innovation and technology, while giving our customers the most enhanced cinematic experience there is.’
