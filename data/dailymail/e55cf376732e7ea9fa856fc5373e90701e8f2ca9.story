James Roberts was found dead in an upturned car strapped in his seat and with his head underwater

A teenager was found dead by his parents in an upturned car in a roadside ditch still strapped into his seat and with his head underwater.

James Roberts was discovered by his mother and father as they drove to his girlfriend's house after he failed to return home the night before.

His father Peter Roberts, 50, had to smash one of the Rover 214's windows to get inside the car, where he found his son upside down with his head under the water.

Mr Roberts, from New York, 
Lincolnshire, today said: 'It was awful. Immediately afterwards, it 
seemed, the emergency services arrived, but obviously it was too late.

'They had to lift the car out and cut James out. He had been dead since the night before. I think he had gone off the road about six or seven o’clock at night.

'It’s an awful time for us at the moment. It’s just a terrible loss. It’s like a part of us has died as well.'

Mr Roberts and his wife Stella, 47, became worried when James failed to return from work last Friday.

The couple rang police and helped officers search through the night.

When there was no sign of him Mr and Mrs Roberts set off to their son's girlfriend’s house and passed his crashed car.

Emergency services recovered the car from the water at about 8.30am, on the Saturday. The call centre worker was pronounced dead at the scene.

James was father to Lily, 18 months, and was working at insurance firm iGO4.

Mr Roberts said: 'He was full of joy with his daughter. He was being a real man, living up to his responsibilities and providing for her. He was caring and had a dry sense of humour.

'He had only been at work for less than a year but he seemed to really get involved in things there.

'James was flitting between our house and his girlfriend’s. He was on the verge of leaving home.'

Officers from Lincolnshire Police have now urged anybody who saw James’s white Rover 214 on Thursday evening to get in touch.
