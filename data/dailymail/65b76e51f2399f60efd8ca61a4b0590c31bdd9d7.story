An alleged rape victim spotted her attacker in a pub during a wake 30 years after she says she was attacked.

The woman, who was 20 at the time of the alleged attack, spotted Lyndon Plummer, now 67, at the pub in Harrow Road, Wembley, north London.

He is accused of raping her twice at a house in west London between January and August 1983, Southwark Crown Court was told.

Relatives noticed Plummer 'staring' at the mother-of-two, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, before 'tempers frayed', jurors heard.

Prosecutor Alisdair Smith told the court about the alleged rape attack: 'The complainant was minding her own business when the defendant made sexual advances' he told the jury.

'She begged him to leave her alone but the prosecution say he just ignored that and raped her.'

'It's perfectly plain, the prosecution say, that the defendant knew she would not have consented.'

Describing the chance meeting at the pub, Mr Smith added: 'The complainant's daughter became aware of a man staring at her mother.

'When the woman saw the man, it seems she was visibly shaken by this. It led to an allegation being made against Mr Plummer there and then in the pub.

'He was confronted and inevitably, you may think, tempers became frayed. There was a fight and police were called. That did lead to the complainant making the allegation (of rape) to police.'

Plummer was arrested in September 2011, when he denied that he had ever raped the woman.

He said the rape claims had been invented to cover up an assault on him at the pub.

But Mr Smith added: 'The prosecution say this would not explain why the fight had taken place in the first place.'

Plummer, of Maida Vale, London, denies two counts of rape.

The trial continues.Â
