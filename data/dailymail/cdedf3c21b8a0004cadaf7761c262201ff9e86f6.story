The British economy is heading for an unprecedented triple dip recession, experts warned today.

The Office for National Statistics confirmed the economy shrank by 0.3 per cent in the last three months of 2012. Poor wages and dire weather in the start of 2013 means growth is not expected to have returned.

The news will pile pressure on Chancellor George Osborne who was last week forced to admit growth predictions for the whole of this year had been dramatically halved - down from 1.2 per cent to just 0.6 per cent.

Figures published by the Office for National Statistics confirmed the economy shrank by 0.3 per cent in thj final quarter of 2012, with figures for the start of 2013 due in April

GDP figures for the current quarter are due to be released at the end of April, with the recent cold weather increasing the chances of two successive quarters of contraction, which would represent a return to recession.

The country's stagnant performance reflects a fall in industrial production of 2.1 per cent in the fourth quarter - including a 10.7 per cent slump in mining and quarrying - and the biggest fall since the first quarter of 2009.

Sarah Hewin, head of research on European economies at Standard Chartered, told Sky News: ‘The real weak spots of the economy are manufacturing and construction. Employment is still rising, but wages are weak. The economy is moving ahead but there is a lot of stopping and starting.

‘We won't avoid a triple-dip recession. We are at risk, but we'll see a pick up later in the year.’

In one glimmer of good news for Mr Osborne, the ONS said it now thinks the UK economy grew by 0.3 per cent across the whole of last year, rather than previous guidance of 0.2 per cent.

Household spending in the fourth quarter increased by more than previously thought, up 0.4 per cent from an earlier 0.2 per cent reading.

Total disposable incomes rose by 2.1 per cent during the year as a whole, but slipped back 0.1 per cent in the fourth quarter.

Chancellor George Osborne admitted in his Budget last week that the forecast for growth in 2013 had been halved to just 0.6 per cent

IHS Global Insight economist Howard Archer said: ‘It looks touch and go whether the economy can avoid further contraction in the first quarter of 2013, and hence a 'triple-dip' recession.’

He said heavy snowfall, which has hit parts of the UK in recent days, increased the chances of another quarter of falling output. Marginal growth of 0.3 per cent in 2012 compared with 1 per cent in 2011.

The figures also showed a household savings ratio of 7.1 per cent, the highest since 1997, as people choose to save rather than spend. This figure was boosted by a £20.1 billion increase in wages and salaries versus 2011.

The UK's current account deficit shrunk to £14 billion in the fourth quarter - worth 3.6 per cent of GDP - from an upwardly revised £15.1 billion in the third quarter. For the year as a whole the UK's current account deficit was £57.7 billion.

The trade deficit - the difference between the value of Britain's exports and imports - widened to £9.6 billion in the fourth quarter, up from £8.1 billion in the previous quarter.

Companies exported 1.6 per cent fewer goods in the fourth quarter, while services exports fell 1.8 per cent.

Dr Archer said: ‘This export performance is really disappointing, even allowing for the problems in the eurozone and generally muted global growth, and is a blow to hopes that the economy can rebalance.’

The UK's persistent economic weakness has already led to the loss of its prized AAA rating.

Former Labour trade minister Lord Digby Jones yesterday played down the idea that the atrocious weather made a triple dip recession more likely.

He told BBC2’s Daily Politics: ‘"No more than it was two weeks ago [for the economy to go back into recession], it’s going to cost more people more money in power, energy gas oil electricity.’
