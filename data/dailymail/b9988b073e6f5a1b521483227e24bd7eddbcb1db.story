It was billed as 'the most amazing Christmas experience that planet Earth has ever seen', complete with a baby reindeer hut, hundreds of Christmas trees and a festive express train to take children to visit Santa.

But a festive winter wonderland created by interior designer Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen has shut after just one day after dozens of children were left in tears because of rude staff, Santas Little Helpers stood around smoking and broken rides.

Parents said the Magical Journey at the Belfry Golf Club in Wishaw, Warwickshire, has ruined the build up to Christmas for their children, as they attacked the 'tacky' attraction which costs up to £22.50 for a ticket.

The Magical Journey in Warwickshire closed on Sunday after just one day following complaints by parents about long queues, rude staff and cheap toys at the attraction, created by Laurence Llewlyn-Bowen

The ride was closed on Sunday as organisers said they needed to make improvements to the experience 

Organisers confirmed they had closed the site for three days until Wednesday so they 'could implement changes and improvements to the experience.'

But unhappy families have demanded their money back after bombarding the company with complaints.

Parents complained about rude staff, large queues for their children to visit Father Christmas and said cheap unwrapped presents, some squashed or broken, were being handed out to their children.

Others complained of a lack of festive decorations and Christmas music, despite paying more than £20 a ticket for their children.

Natalie Craig wrote on Facebook: 'I want my £22 refunded. 

'You did not deliver what you advertised and have ripped people off that is the issue and some of your staff are damn right rude and clearly do not care.

'Magical experience what a joke and it didn't even last the allocated time of 80/90 Minutes either.'

Alex Turner added: 'Never mind the 'rain', the rude & unhelpful staff, unsafe train, rubbish cheap present that's given unwrapped, workmen sat around smoking, empty tepees, rooms not being soundproofed, no music or festive decorations, waiting around in a succession of empty rooms, and lack of a baby reindeer are frankly enough for me to digest!!'

Elizabeth Yeomans said: 'Ruining the magic of Christmas for little kids!

'Ripping off parents right on top of Christmas when they could've spent that money on Christmas presents! Well done!! I hope Laurence whatever his name is, and The Belfry, are proud!!'   

Parents reported that the winter express train, to Santa's grotto, broke down during the first day it was open

Organisers said the Magical Journey would be closed for three days and heavy rain had affected preparations

The Magical Journey remained closed today following complaints about smoking elves and poor decorations

Mr Llewlyn-Bowen unveiled the winter wonderland last week and had promised it would be a unique festive experience for families. He said a visit to Father Christmas would 'never be the same again' and that the experience was 'going to be perfect.'

Tickets were sold up for the weekend and seven days in the run-up to Christmas and organisers had been working through the night last week to get the attraction ready for the launch day after preparations were hampered by heavy rain.  

However many have criticised both Llewlyn-Bowen and organisers behind Magical Journey for false advertising and poor health and safety.

Mother-of-three Melanie Brzonkalik, 46, was one of the first to visit the attraction at 10am on Saturday.

She paid £140 for tickets and travelling up from Gloucester, a three hour round trip, with her three children Noah, five, Tegan, 13, and Sam, 15.

The teaching assistant said she knew straight away the visit was going to be a 'nightmare' after spotting elves hanging around outside smoking and complaining about their shifts.

She said the Christmas illusion was then completely shattered when they saw a 'very skinny Santa.'

She said: 'You could see right through to the back where there was boxes of fake snow and diggers and elves standing around having a fag.

'It shatters the magic somewhat straight away when you see elves standing around smoking and moaning that they were working until 9pm.

'My 15-year-old son just looked at me to say 'where on earth have you brought me to?

 

'As you went in there was a few Christmas trees but without any decorations or lights or music - it was depressing.

'Then we walked through a door that looked like any old arena or hall. There was no Christmas feel to it whatsoever, the stalls were poor and the museum was appalling.

'They had a few antlers, a sledge and then a babygrow with fur around which was supposed to be Santa's when he was a baby. It was laughable.

'Our Santa was OK but there was this really skinny Santa there too, which people weren't too happy about at all. Especially when the presents weren't even wrapped.

'We went because we respect and like Llewelyn-Bowen and his personality but we were bitterly disappointed.

'It just didn't seem finished, it will take more than three days to get that all sorted, that's for sure.' 

Anthony Kingscott said: 'I visited the magical journey today at 10.30am the whole experience was a joke, budget is not the word to explain this place.

'While we tock (sic) the 15 second train journey the train hit a tractor parked in the car park then one of the trees if they would of hit the tractor any harder the train would of turned over the train was being driven wrecklessly and too fast for the conditions.

Parents claimed long queues and broken down rides at the attraction had ruined their children's Christmas

Mr Llewlyn-Bowen opened the experience last week and said the festive attraction was going to be 'perfect' 

The festive experience was billed as 'the most amazing' Christmas attraction ever seen before it opened 

'I will be contacting health and safety to report this first thing Monday morning, the main tent construction had screws and sharp objects sticking out, there has been no thought of safety at this event at all.'

Organisers said torrential rain over the last few days had affected lighting and sound at the site and also saw a large build up on mud.  

On the Facebook site for Magical Journey, organisers posted: 'Based on customer feedback we have taken the decision to take three full days closure today (23/11/14), tomorrow (24/11/14) and Tuesday (25/11/14) in order that we can implement changes and improvements to the experience.

'Our customers are our priority for safety and a magical experience and we sincerely apologise for any inconvenience this may cause.

'It is important that we deliver the high quality experience you are expecting and hope to reopen with improvements and changes having been made' 

'We have also had difficulty with torrential rain on site affecting effecting the lighting and sound, we have people working to repair this damage.' 

Customers affected by the closures have been offered refunds or the chance to rebook the experience.  

Speaking at the launch, Mr Llewlyn-Bowen said: 'It is a brave thing to be doing this sort of thing completely outside. Normally it is in an industrial unit so these things can be completely controlled.

'There is no magic in that. Yes, we have had some teething troubles. But by Saturday it is going to be absolutely perfect.

'We set ourselves a very high bar. We wanted to push the envelope. We have been very lucky with the location with the Belfry.

'We have a sensational section of woodland that we can use for the grand finale.'

On the company's website the Magical Journey is described as 'a never before seen and magnificent immersive theatrical version' of Santa's Grotto. It also promises to be a spectacular experience 'with Laurence's flair for the dramatic.' 

The experience promised a Big Top with an indoor market as well as seasonal food and drink. And for children the site advertised an elf display and a ride on 'Father Christmas' Express Train' through snowy woodland. 

Tickets cost between £10 and £15 for adults, and £17.50 and £22.50 for children, depending on what day of the week customers visit. A weekend trip would cost a family of four with two children £75.

The wonderland, which is due to run to Christmas Eve, was launched by Mr Llewlyn-Bowen on Thursday. It features 700 Christmas trees and 140 elf workers.

Mr Llewlyn-Bowen has been contacted for comment.
