New rules in the U.S. which come into force today will make it easier for people to donate their faces and hands in transplant operations.

The policy will treat face, hand and limb transplants – known as vascularised composite allografts (VCAs) - like other organs that can be donated, to make life-changing procedures a viable option for more people.

However, people carrying donor cards will not automatically be signed up.

VCAs involve the transplantation of 
multiple structures and can include skin, bone, muscles, blood vessels,
 nerves and connective tissue.

More people are having face and hand transplants and now new rules in the U.S. are set to make the process slightly easier. Connie Culp survived a gun shot to her face (pictured left after initial surgery) and in 2008 had 80 per cent of her face transplanted (right)

The Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN), in Richmond, Virginia, which allocates organs in the U.S. has been struggling to allocate face and hand transplants because there has been no formal policy in place before now.

Dr Sue McDiarmid, who chairs the organisation’s Vascularized Composite Allograft Transplantation Committee told ABC News that the rules should increase the number of procedures performed.

‘There are more of these procedures being done in the United States,’ she said.

‘[The new rules mean that] if there appears to be a potential donor that is interested or has stated ahead of time that they specifically would be interested in donating…we can go forward with that.’

Dr McDiarmid explained that a person or next of kin must give explicit consent that they want to donate their hands or face.

Organ
 donor registries are state-run, so different parts of the U.S, will 
have different methods for securing the extra consent in the future.

Dr Kenneth 
Andreoni, President of OPTN, said: 'These policies establish the 
framework for further development of this groundbreaking therapy, which 
returns vital function and identity to people who have suffered a 
devastating injury or illness.'

'We want to make this treatment more widely available while recognising the unique medical and ethical issues involved.'

The first face transplant was performed in the U.S. in 2008 and the first hand transplant in 1999.

Since then, seven people have received new faces, eight people two ‘new’ hands and 14 single hands.

The new rules, which come into force today in the U.S. will treat face, hand and limb transplants like other organs that can be donated, to make life-changing procedures a viable option for more people.

Last year, surgeons in Poland carried out a total face transplant on a 33-year-old man whose face was torn off in an accident with stone-cutting machinery.

Surgeons at the Oncology Centre in Gliwice said the 27-hour operation was performed just weeks after the accident.

Previous transplants have taken months or years to prepare, but surgeons were able to reconstruct his face, jaws, palate and the bottom of his eye sockets.

Just six days after the surgery, the man was able to give a thumbs up gesture from his hospital bed.

Face transplant recipients include Charla Nash, whose face was mailed by a chimpanzee and Connie Culp, who survived a gunshot to her face in 2008 underwent a 22-hour procedure where 80 per cent of her face was transplanted.

Carmen Blandin Tarleton whose husband attacked her with a caustic solution, blinding her and leaving her face unrecognisable, also had the procedure.

Following her face transplant, she said: ‘The donor and her family have given me a tremendous gift making a significant difference in my quality of life at the daily level.’

As with any organ donations, the face and hands must be removed from a corpse immediately after death.

Dr McDiarmid said that if the family of a donor wanted to have an open-casket funeral, a mould could be used to make a mask, or a prosthetic temporarily fitted.
