The fierce court battle between Estee Lauder's billionaire cosmetics executive grandson and his embittered baby mama is back in the spot light after revelations he paid an employee to defame her.

An unnamed man has sworn on behalf of socialite Taylor Stein that William Lauder, 53, offered him cash and a job in exchange for making 'false and misleading statements' about Stein.

Litigation between Lauder and Stein has been unending since the 2007 birth of their daughter and has even seen Stein arrested for domestic battery after she punched her billionaire ex in the face.

According to the complaint filed in California, the man claims Lauder offered him cash and 'other valuable considerations'--a job, according to Page Six--to make injurious claims against Lauder's lover turned courtroom foe.

The latest turn comes as Stein--daughter of legendary rock promoter Howard Stein--fights for ownership of the Los Angeles home he purchased for her and their daughter.

While he reportedly promised the home to her, Lauder says Stein has since violated the terms of their support agreement.

Saga: Stein (at right with Tara Guber at left and Linda Thompson at center) has been fighting for ownership of the Los Angeles home Lauder purchased for her and their daughter Djuna, who was born in 2007. Now she says she has evidence Lauder hired a man to defame her for his benefit

Documents filed on behalf of Stein claim 
the 40-something socialite was ''further damaged by causing her to 
retain the services of a [retired] Los Angeles district attorney to 
disprove the statements obtained by W. Lauder.'

Stein and Lauder were an item while he was still married and had a daughter together, Djuna.

Not long after the childâ€™s birth, Lauder agreed to pay Stein $9.5 million through to the year 2017 on the proviso that she moved to California and wouldn't visit New York for more than two weeks a year. She also had to alert him six weeks in advance before her trips east.

Stein has since had to take Lauder to court after he attempted to renege on the deal.

The New York Post reported in August that Stein punched Lauder in the face after the pair got into an argument on an L.A. street in November 2012.

Despite, or perhaps because of their history, Lauder choose to press charges and Stein was arrested and later released on $50,000 bail.

She subsequently pleaded guilty to misdemeanor domestic violence and was fined $1,834 and sentenced to 19 days of community service - cleaning streets for the California Department of Transportation.
