Rochelle Humes is getting us all fired up for Christmas with her new collection of party pieces for Very.co.uk.

The 25-year-old singer showcases her enviable figure and stylish new dresses in the latest campaign imagery.

Speaking about her latest drop, The Saturdays singer said: 'Christmas is the perfect time to go all out and get really glammed up as you can’t be too overdressed.

'I can’t wait to be in sequins head-to-toe, that’s what my navy number is for!.'

Rochelle was launched as a designer for Very in June this year and her debut collection was such a hit that she was invited back for round two.

'Rochelle’s collection gives ours customers access to her style', said a spokesperson for the brand.

'The range is set to be a big success and we’re sure to see a few different outfits at the Christmas party.'

It's been a successful year for Rochelle. The young star is also the face of Pandora's #ChristmasWishes campaign alongside her husband Marvin. 

The couple - married for two years and together for four - are now parents to Alaia Mai and were hand-selected to star in the seasonal adverts, alongside Jamie and Louise Redknapp.
