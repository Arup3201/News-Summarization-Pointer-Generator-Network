Statement of intent: Vterean democracy activist Aung San Suu Kyi has admitted she wants to run for president

Mynamar's pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi has said she wants to run for president.

The Nobel peace prize laureate made the admission during the first day of open discussions at the World Economic Forum today.

'I want to run for president and I'm quite frank about it,' the Associated Free Press reports her as saying.

'If I pretended that I didn't want to be president, I wouldn't be honest and I would rather be honest with my people than otherwise.'

Speaking in the capital Naypyidaw, Suu Kyi called for an amendment of the military-drafted constitution which prevents her from leading the country.

It currently prohibits anyone whose spouses or children are overseas citizens from leading the country.

Suu Kyi had two sons with her late husband Michael and it is widely believed the clause was included specifically to bar her from running for president.

The government of President Thein Sein has been praised in the past two years for wide-ranging democratic reforms which have led to lifting of most Western sanctions.

Political prisoners have been freed, Suu Kyi has been welcomed into a new parliament and fragile creasefires have been achieved between Myanmar's warring ethnic minorities.

Suu Kyi, who was imprisoned by the former military dictatorship for 15 years, remains a popular icon in Myanmar and her party the National League for Democracy is expected to win the next elections if they are free and fair.

But she said the large majority of the population are yet to see the benefits of reform.

'If you talk to the man on the street, if you talk to people in villages, the great majority of them would say that their lives have not changed since 2010.

'This is a transformation time.'

Suu Kyi admitted the first task will be for her to campaign for the constitution to be amended for her to become president.

She did not speak of having optimism of achieving the change, but said she would instead concentrate on 'endeavour'.

Although heralded as a heroine by many, Suu Kyi has faced some critcism for not speaking up for the human rights of Muslims who have been persecuted in Myanmar.

Human Rights Watch has accused the Myanmar government of the 'systematic and wide ranging persecution' of Muslims in the state of Rohingya, who it says have been the target of ethnic cleansing.

Suu Kyi argued that she has tried to intervene, but that the solution to the problem is establishing a rule of law which meets 'international norms'.

'I would like all of the world to understand that we are aware of the difficulties in our country and we're doing our best to cope with it,' she added. 'When I say 'we' I'm not talking about the government, I'm talking about ordinary people in Burma.'

Government minister Soe Thane, who was also on the panel, agreed that the constitution had to change, but said that it will take time to establish democracy after decades of military rule.

but stressed that decades of military rule had created binds that would take time to unravel.

'We need time. We are in the dark ages, the other system was in place about 60 years. We have an idea to arrange for everything we have to change but we need time,' he said.
