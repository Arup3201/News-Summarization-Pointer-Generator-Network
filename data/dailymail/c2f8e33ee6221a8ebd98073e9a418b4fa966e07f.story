Manuel Neuer is widely regarded as one of the best goalkeepers in the world, and rightly so. His shot-stopping prowess and supreme command of the box have made him a formidable opponent for any forward.

But on Monday night in Porto Alegre Neuer showed another side to his game, using his feet to great effect.

Time and again the German keeper stormed 
out of his area to sweep up behind a lethargic back-line which looked 
unable to cope with the pacy Algerians on the break.

The 28-year-old sprinted out of his 
area to tackle Algerians several times, as well as making several sharp 
clearances, and racing out to use his head to stop an attack.

In fact Neuer made as many tackles 
during the game as he did saves, with Algeria failing to really 
stretch the German number one inside his area until deep into extra time.

Throughout the last-16 tie the Bayern Munich goalkeeper touched the ball 21 times outside his penalty area, and in the first half in particular he seemed to be playing more outside his box than inside.

Germany have a history of world class sweepers, but the World Cup winning captains Franz Beckenbauer and Lothar Matthaus were both outfield players, whereas Neuer has take on the role from between the sticks.

Heads up: The keeper is out again, this time to head away with Islam Slimani closing in for Algeria

Hands on: Neuer looked a little less comfortable with his hands, dropping one cross under pressure

Out again: With little pace in the German back-line Neuer took on the role of sweeper-keeper to great effect

Celebration: Neuer ensured Germany stayed solid at the back, and celebrated when they finally scored

His 
starting position, from right on the edge of the area, meant that he was
 able to stop moves before they had a chance to develop in behind his 
back four.

Neuer's
 high-risk strategy is similar to that employed by France goalkeeper 
Hugo Lloris at Spurs, and it paid off, as Germany limited Algeria to 
just two shots on target during the first 90 minutes, neither of them particularly threatening.

The Bayern Munich stopper also showed some playmaking abilities when he set Andre Schurrle away with a long punt after collecting a corner.

Germany eventually found a way past Neuer's opposite number Rais M'Bolhi in extra time, Premier League duo Schurrle and Mesut Ozil with the goals.

Neuer was finally beaten in the 121st minute but by then the game was safe.
