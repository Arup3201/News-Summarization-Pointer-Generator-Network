Beryl O'Flynn was the perfect grandmother who never forgot a birthday - all 130 of them.

The doting 87-year-old pensioner would always slip £5 into Christmas and birthday cards - at a cost of £1,500 a year.

After she passed away her family have paid tribute to the legendary 'supergran' who had 13 children, 48 grandchildren, 76 great grandchildren and six great-great grandchildren - so many that her family say it was difficult to keep count.

On her 85th birthday, she reflected on her life, children and grandchildren along with more than 120 guests.

She said: 'I can die happy, I
 have had a happy life. I have got good children and they look after me,
 I don't want for anything.

'I am delighted to be the head of such a large family - and most of them look like me!

'It is amazing to think what me and my husband started all those years ago.'

Her son Brian Curtis, 64, said she will be remembered fondly.

He said: 'She was a legend. Everyone has their own little stories about her. She was just a fantastic lady, the stuff of folklore and wherever she went people knew her.

'She had a kind nature and her response to any of her grandchildren was 'no probs'.

Loving Beryl never forgot to send any of her growing offspring a card for their birthdays or Christmas which meant a card every three days on average.

Beryl's oldest grandchild Leanna is 40 - the same age as her youngest son Kevin.

She outlived her second husband Kevin O' Flynn, who died 16 years
 ago of a heart attack. She never spoke about her first husband.

Hundreds of well-wishers lined the streets of Splott, Cardiff, for the retired biscuit factory worker's funeral.

And more than 600 people said their goodbyes at Beryl's funeral at St Alban's Church in Splott.

So many people brought flowers to her funeral that they had to be put in a separate hearse just to carry them as the procession moved through the streets of Cardiff.

Her grandchildren, great grandchildren and great-great grandchildren wrote messages to Beryl on balloons and released them from the graveside.
