Neymar might be back in training with Barcelona, but the Brazil star still had time to relax with a group of friends.

The 22-year-old posted photos of himself and a group of them at the cinema, and also posed for a selfie with a friend.

Neymar retuned to training at the end of last week after the back injury that ended his World Cup. A statement on the club's website said: 'He will be given a thorough examination by the club's medical services to evaluate his recovery.'

Barcelona will play their final friendly game on Monday when they host Mexican side Leon.

Luis Enrique's side have had a mixed pre-season - they have only lost one of their four games, but with stars Lionel Messi, Neymar and Luis Suarez all absent the Catalan club will be far from full strength when the season begins.

Barcelona will kick-off their La Liga campaign at home to Elche, a fixture they won 4-0 last season with a hat-trick from the now-departed Alexis Sanchez.
