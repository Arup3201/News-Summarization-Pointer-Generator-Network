Split: Beverley Flynn who divorced her former husband John Cooper in 1997

The ex-husband of a leading Irish politician has disappeared and not spoken to his family for 16 years since his divorce, it has been revealed.

Former Fianna Fail TD Beverley Flynn separated from John Cooper in 1997 and he severed all ties with his own family.

Ms Flynn - who reverted 
from Mrs Flynn-Cooper back to her maiden name a decade ago - was married to Mr Cooper for six 
years before they separated.

His family are keen to get back in touch with their long lost relative so that he can attend his brother's funeral next week.

Ms Flynn is the daughter of former 
Fianna Fáil minister Pádraig Flynn and served as a TD from 1997 but 
retired from politics at the last election in 2011.

Mr Cooper was brought up in south London but moved over to Ireland to be with Ms Flynn in 1989 as she sought to follow in her father's footsteps and go into politics.

The pair met in France, but their marriage broke down and they were separated.

The last time Mr Cooper's family in England spoke to him, he was working in the marketing department at the Guinness brewery in Dublin, the Irish Independent reported.

There was no row that led to him losing contact - and his family don't know why he hasn't spoken to them.

They have never reported him missing because they believe he may have chosen to start a new life and cut all ties after his split.

His brother Peter John Cooper died recently and his funeral takes place next week. He also has another brother called Ron and a sister called Valerie.

The missing man's nephew Stephen Cooper, 53, told the Irish Independent: 'Nobody in the family here in the UK has heard from him since 1997.

'It might be that he doesn't want to be in touch or that something has happened to him.

'If we can find John, it would be great to see him again and allow him to say farewell to his brother.'

The funeral is taking in place in Mr Cooper's native south London at Beckenham Cemetery in Bromley on May 8.

Ms Flynn has not commented on her ex-husband.
