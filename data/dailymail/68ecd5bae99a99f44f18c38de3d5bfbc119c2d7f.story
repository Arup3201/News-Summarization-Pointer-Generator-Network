An angry pilot was calmed down by police after getting into an argument with an airport security official over his 'condescending' attitude.

Southwest Airlines pilot John Mcghie was going through checks at Manchester-Boston Regional Airport when the row broke out with a Transportation Safety Administration (TSA) worker Bob Harbaugh.

Mr Mcghie complained that he had difficulty in the past getting through the checkpoints, according to police investigating the incident.

He then demanded the name of the TSA official, who infuriated the pilot more by refusing to give him his details, it is claimed.

The row then escalated as the Mr Harbaugh is alleged to have touched Mr Mcghie's arm, say police. 

Officers broke up the dispute and took statements from both men. They are now studying CCTV to see if an assault took place, as the pilot claims.

Mr Mcghie is now demanding that the TSA face assault charges.

Londonderry Police Lt. Tim Jones told Union Leader that an officer at the airport became aware of the two men arguing at around 10.3am last Friday.

He added: 'The pilot felt that the supervisor was condescending and patronizing. He wanted the supervisor's name but he refused to give it.

'The argument escalated from there, but never got more physical than TSA official Bob Harbaugh touching Mcghie's arm, Jones said.

'At that point Mr. Mcghie told him not to touch him. Mr. Harbaugh became defensive and threatened to call the police.'

Mr Jones said there were no witnesses to the incident but that it was loud enough for the nearby officer to be concerned about it.  

Mcghie is also alleged to have said he never raised his voice during the incident and told the officer that he had problems with the TSA at Manchester in the past.

Mr Jones said that CCTV footage from the airport would clear up whether an assault took place.

The TSA said it was aware of the dispute. They added that the police were now dealing with the investigation.

Spokesman Ann Davis said: 'A preliminary review of the situation indicates that the officer followed proper screening protocol.

'We'll await the Londonderry Police Department's findings as well.'

Southwest Airlines spokeswoman Christi McNeill confirmed that the airline was also conducting its own probe.

Mr Mcgie was unavailable for comment. A Linkedin page set up for the pilot does not have any images of him but says he is based in the Greater Boston area and a pilot at Southwest Airlines.
