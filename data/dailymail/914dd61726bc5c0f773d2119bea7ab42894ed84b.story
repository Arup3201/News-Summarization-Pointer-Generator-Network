Perched at the top of a mountain, this cleaner prepares to make his descent to collect litter at a Chinese beauty spot.

He then begins to abseil down Mount Emei in Sichuan province to pick up the rubbish left behind by visitors.

Tourists visiting the peak often complain about trash littering the trail, which is admired for its rich biodiversity and for being a natural beauty spot.

However, cleaner Peng Wencai descends down the mountain two or three times a week picking up trash dropped by people visiting the mountain.
