The German government has called for Greece to hand control over its finances to the European Union in what would be an unprecedented expansion of Brussels' power.

Under the plan,  in order for the embattled country to receive a second bail-out - now estimated at up to €145bn (£122bn) - a eurozone 'budget commissioner' would be given the power to decide Athens' tax and spending,

The proposed power grab, revealed today by the Financial Times, would be met by strong opposition in Athens, where anti-German protests have already been seen on the streets and in the media.

Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papdemos is yet to comment on the proposal from Chancellor Angela Merkel's government. The plan would see his state stripped of its power to control tax and spending

Voters in Greece have already expressed anger about EU moves to 
intervene in its reform process, and any proposal to surrender yet more powers to Brussels could prompt further protests.

Under the extraordinary extension of European control, the commissioner would be able to veto 
decisions taken by the Greek government if they were not in line with 
targets set by international lenders.

The proposal, which highlights the 
deep level of mistrust between Greece and other EU countries, was apparently 
circulated to finance ministry officials from the eurozone countries 
yesterday afternoon.

'Given
 the disappointing compliance so far, Greece has to accept shifting 
budgetary sovereignty to the European level for a certain period of 
time," the document reportedly says. "Budget consolidation has to be put under a 
strict steering and control system."

Many Greeks are already protesting against moves by the EU to force a cut in state spending

The German plan comes after months of worsening relationships between EU member states and Greece. The appointment of economist Lucas Papademos as technocratic prime minister in November has not helped improve attitudes towards the financially stricken country.

The proposal comes amid intense 
talks to finalise the second rescue package for Greece, which has 
repeatedly failed to meet the fiscal targets set out for it by its 
international lenders.

Greece first needs to strike a deal with its 
private sector creditors in the next couple of days to unlock its next 
aid package and avoid a chaotic default.
 If it does not receive fresh aid, Greece could default as early as 
March, when bonds totalling €14.5 billion (£12.2 billion) are due.

Violent protests against cuts have already rocked the Greek capital and voters are unlikely to take kindly to EU moves to push through further reforms

Under
 the proposal, Athens would only be allowed to carry out normal state 
spending after servicing its debt. Creditors could be assured that 
defaults would not occur in future.

'If a future (bail-out) tranche is not disbursed, Greece cannot threaten 
its lenders with a default, but will instead have to accept further
 cuts in primary expenditures as the only possible consequence of any 
non-disbursement,' the Financial Times quotes the document as saying.

Athens has not yet responded to the proposal. A senior Greek finance ministry official said it was unaware of the plan and so was not able to comment.

'No country has put forward such a proposal at the Eurogroup,' a Greek finance ministry official said on condition of anonymity, adding that the government would not formally comment on reports based on unnamed sources.

Meanwhile, Greece's international lenders have apparently increased the figure they believe the indebted country will need from the euro zone from 130 billion (£109bn) to 145 billion euros (£122bn).

German news magazine Der Spiegel reported that the extra 15 billion (£13bn) euros were needed because of the deteriorating economic situation in Greece.

Der Spiegel quoted a representative of the troika of foreign leaders - the European Commission, IMF and the European Central Bank - saying: 'We're assuming that it won't be possible to collect missing money solely from the private creditors.'

Talks with private creditors on swapping existing Greek bonds for longer-term debt made significant progress on legal and technical issues and will continue Saturday, both sides said late on Friday.          

A preliminary deal could be sealed by Sunday evening, a Greek government official said, with the aim of submitting a public offer to bondholders by Feb. 15.   

However, EU Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn told Reuters on Thursday more public money will be needed to make up a shortfall in the second bailout for Greece even if private bondholders agree to take a share of losses.             

Rehn said euro zone governments and EU institutions would need to make up the difference so that Greece's public debt can be reduced to close to 120 percent of annual output by 2020, seen as a more sustainable level. 

'We are preparing a package which will pave the way for a sustainable solution for Greece, and in that package, yes, on the basis of the revised debt sustainability analysis, there is likely to be some increased need of official sector funding, but not anything dramatic,' Rehn said.     

It was the first time a top EU official had spelled out that more public money than the planned 130 billion euros would be required for a second Greek bailout package.        

Germany, France and other euro zone states have so far described the 130 billion (£109bn) figure agreed in October as a red line that must not be crossed.

Rehn declined to say how big the funding shortfall would be. But an EU source said there could be a funding shortfall of 12 to 15 billion euros.
