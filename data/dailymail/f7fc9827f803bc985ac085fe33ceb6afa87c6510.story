Manchester United set off for Munich on Tuesday afternoon in a bid to do the seemingly impossible and dump German giants Bayern out of the Champions League.

Old Trafford played host to a 1-1 draw last week with David Moyes' men looking to spring a surprise at the Allianz Arena.

Star striker Wayne Rooney training at Carrington before flying to Germany is a massive boost to those chances.

Despite not being eligible for the game due to being cup-tied after turning out for Chelsea, Juan Mata travelled to support his team-mates.

Rooney missed United's 4-0 win over Newcastle at the weekend after it emerged that he may have chipped a bone in his foot.

 Giggs also trained after missing the Newcastle game but Marouane 
Fellaini, who came off at St James' Park suffering from dizziness, and 
Rafael did not take part, and neither travelled.

Rooney, Giggs and the rest of the United squad underwent a light workout in a session partly open to media at their Aon Training Complex before flying out to Germany.

Rooney appeared to have no adverse reaction to the injury and he seemed in good spirits during training.

United boss David Moyes revealed that 
Rooney was ‘touch and go’ for the second leg at the Allianz Arena after 
suffering what was thought to be a badly bruised toe in last week’s 1-1 
draw at Old Trafford, but it now appears that the damage may be more 
serious.

However, the 
28-year-old England forward is determined to play in United’s biggest 
game of the season with the help of powerful painkilling tablets as 
Moyes’ side bid to end Bayern’s reign as European champions.

And Bayern coach Pep Guardiola was in no doubt that Rooney would line up for the Reds on Wednesday night.

He said: 'Rooney is going to play, 100 per cent. He is going to play, I bet you a big big glass of beer.'Guardiola described Rooney as 'a big player, one of the best I have seen in my career.'

The odds remain against United as they take on the European champions, despite their creditable performance in the first leg.

Yet for Rooney, confidence that United can not only triumph but go on to win the competition, is still high.

The England forward told UEFA.com: 'Of course (I believe we can win it).

'Everyone has their favourites every year - the likes of Barcelona and Bayern Munich - but it does not always happen.

'When Chelsea won it they nearly went out of the competition three times.

'We believe we can go through. We have good enough players.

'It will be tough because in my opinion Bayern and Barcelona are the two best teams left in the competition, so we have to be at our best.

'We are ready. It's an exciting game for us all - the players and the fans - and it's a massive game to be involved in.'

There
 is an 11-day gap between the Bayern clash and United’s next fixture 
away to his old club Everton on April 20, and it is hoped that will be 
enough to allow a full recovery.

Rooney
 is understood to have been reassured that he would not risk worsening 
the problem, with the World Cup in Brazil just over two months away.

A similar move backfired when United met Bayern in this competition four years ago.

Rooney
 aggravated an ankle injury in the second leg and it was later claimed 
that contributed to his below-par display at South Africa 2010.

After the training session concluded, Rooney said he was feeling good about Wednesday night's second leg.

He wrote on his facebook page: 'Good training session with the lads ahead of the Bayern Munich match tomorrow night.

'It's a massive game for us against a top side but we'll be going in confident and looking to progress into the semi-finals.'
