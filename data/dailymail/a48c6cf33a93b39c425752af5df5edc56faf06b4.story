Not content with a hit reality TV show, a clothing collection in Dorothy Perkins and a sell-out make-up range, the Kardashian sisters are adding yet another collaboration to their burgeoning CV.

Kim, Kourtney and Khloe are launching their eponymous fashion line with Lipsy London.

The high-street fashion brand has announced a partnership with retail supplier Jupi Corp to team up with the LA-based trio.

They can't be stopped! The Kardashian sisters are now launching a clothing line with Lipsy London

This will be the reality stars' second line in the UK, after their range for
Dorothy Perkins was a huge success.

Their range for Lipsy will, however, have a 
more higher-end feel to it and a higher price point to reflect that, with items retailing from £30 to £150.

The collection will be a nod to each of the sister’s signature style and will 'embrace 
Kim's glamorous vibe, Kourtney's eclectic taste and Khloe's edgy style' with 
sequined biker jackets, tribal embellished crop tops, 
lace overlay jumpsuits and full feather coats.

Commenting on the new collaboration, 
Khloe said: 'We're so excited to announce the launch of Kardashian 
Kollection for Lipsy in the UK, Ireland, Russia and the Middle East this
October.

'We're collaborating with Lipsy to bring a fresh new range of 
pieces and I can't wait for the new line to hit stores.'

Sister Kim added: 'We always want 
to keep things fresh and exciting for our fans across the world and we 
can't wait to see the response around these new pieces.

'There are some 
really stylish blazers for the fall, sexy evening dresses and statement 
pieces I can't wait for everyone to see.'

Hungry for more: This will be the reality stars second line in the UK, after their range for Dorothy Perkins was a huge success

Bruno Schiavi president of Jupi Corp, which produces the Kardashian 
line, said: 'Our partnership with Lipsy will bring a
fresh range of exclusive apparel to Kardashian Kollection fans.

'Lipsy is an innovative fashion brand and I'm confident this 
collection will be Lipsy's most exciting line of products yet. Kourtney,
Kim and Khloe are looking forward to working with Lipsy and their 
partners to make Kardashian Kollection for Lipsy a tremendous success.'

Jeremy Stakol, Lipsy CEO, added: 'Kourtney, Kim and Khloe are inspirational women. We are confident that 
our design collaboration has produced an exciting range that their fans 
will love.

'The Kardashians have never been more popular in the UK and we
look forward to launching their aspirational range this October.'

Different style: The Lipsy collection will be more high-end than their Dorothy Perkins one, with items priced between £30-£150

All about the dress: Lipsy is a British fashion brand that was founded in the heart of London in 1988 and it has fast become famous for its party dresses

The Kardashian Kollection for Lipsy will
be sold at Lipsy retail and franchise outlets, Lipsy.co.uk, as well as 
online at Next.co.uk and all Next international websites, which owns the
Lipsy brand, and through exclusive Lipsy wholesale accounts including 
Very.co.uk and House of Fraser from October.

The trio are following in the footsteps of songstress Pixie Lott, who collaborated with the label back in 2010.

The famous sisters have been extremely busy recently.

Hot on the heels of their fast fashion 
collaboration with Dorothy Perkins Kim, Khloe and Kourtney created their
affordable cosmetics line- Kardashian Beauty- for Feelunique.com.

Many of the products have sold out online and fans hoping to emulate the girl's look have joined waiting lists to get their hands on the products.
