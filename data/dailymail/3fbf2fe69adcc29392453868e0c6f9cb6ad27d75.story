At the age of 13, Megan Worrall thought nothing of jumping on a sunbed to take the last few minutes of her mother's session.

When she was younger, her mother had been diagnosed with psoriasis and believed using sunbeds would help her skin condition.

Lured by the glamorous pictures of tanned women on the walls of the sunbed salon, Miss Worrall believed two sessions a week was good for her health, helping boost her vitamin D levels.

But six years later while watching Channel 4's Embarrassing Bodies, the then 19-year-old realised the dangers, noticing changes to a mole on her leg.

Megal Worrall, from Liverpool, first started using sunbeds when she was 13 years old, jumping on for the last few minutes of her mother's sessions

The naturally pale-skinned and freckly teenager was referred to a dermatologist, who removed the mole along - leaving a 9cm scar - with another on her stomach, before giving her the devastating diagnosis.

Miss Worrall had the most deadly form of skin cancer, melanoma, which can spread quickly to other parts of the body.

Today the 22-year-old is in remission and is an ardent critic of sunbeds, urging young people to opt for safer, fake tanning products.

She has shunned sunbeds for the last years, and now shelters under umbrellas while on holiday to avoid the midday sun.

She told This Morning: 'My mum was diagnosed with psoriasis when she was younger.

'She was in hospital for six weeks and was treated with sunbeds and so we thought they were beneficial.

'When I was younger I would jump on for the last few minutes of her sessions.

'Sunbed
 salons are full of pictures of beautiful women on the walls, it implies
 there are health benefits and there is lots of advertising saying 
vitamin D is good for your health.

But Miss Worrall told This Morning, six years later, when she was 19 she was diagnosed with melanoma, the most aggressive form of skin cancer

'We don't get much sun here so I thought it was totally beneficial.'

In 2005, when Miss Worrall was just 13, it
 was illegal for anyone under the age of 16 to use a sunbed. Today the 
age limit has been raised and it is currently illegal for anyone under 
the age of 18 to use one.

But Miss Worrall said she never had a problem persuading staff in sunbed shops that she was old enough.

While people questioned her age, they took her word for it that she was over 16.

By the time she was 16, Miss Worrall was regularly using sunbeds at least twice a week.

And she said, many of her peers at school were jumping on the sunbed wagon.

'Lots of the boys at school suffered acne and so would go on sunbeds to clear their skin up,' the now 22-year-old said.

'Coming into school burned, and saying we had been on a sunbed, which you had to be 16 to go on, was almost a badge of honour.'

But
 for Miss Worrall, who naturally has pale skin dotted with freckles and 
moles, the years of exposure to harmful UV rays took its toll.

Miss Worrall first noticed changes to a mole on her left leg, after watching Channel 4's Embarrassing Bodies show where a woman was discussing her case of skin cancer

At the age of 19, Miss Worrall had two moles removed, one from her left leg leaving a 9cm scar (pictured), and another from her stomach

Skin cancer is one of the most common cancers in the world.

There are two types - melanoma, which spreads very quickly in the body, and non-melanoma, which is more common.

Melanoma is a rare and serious type of cancer, which begins in the skin and spreads to other organs in the body.

A new mole or a change in an existing mole is a typical sign of skin cancer.

This can happen anywhere on the body, but most often on the legs, back, arms and face.

Around 13,300 people in the UK are diagnosed with melanoma each year.

It is the fifth most common cancer overall in the country, excluding non-melanoma skin cancer.

The number of people being diagnosed with melanoma is four times higher than it was 30 years ago.

Exposure to ultraviolet light increases a person's risk of developing melanoma.Â 

The more moles a person has on their body, the higher their risk of developing the disease.

Those with a lot of moles and freckly skin should be very careful in the sun.

Having fair skin and a tendency to get sunburn will also increase a person's risk.

At the age of 19, when she was watching an episode of Channel 4's Embarrassing Bodies, Miss Worrall realised there were dangers associated with using sunbeds.

'The doctor was talking to a girl, and he pointed out the ABC theory - asymmetry, border and colour,' she said.

'I noticed a change on one of my moles on my leg and thought I had to go to the doctors.

'I was referred to a dermatologist who told me I would have to have the mole removed.'

She added: 'They called me early with my results so I had an idea something was wrong.

'You hope for the best but expect the worst, but even then I didn't expect skin cancer at 19.'

Today
 the 22-year-old is in remission but faces regular check-ups with her 
dermatologist to check for any more changes on her body.

The ordeal has changed Miss Worrall's life for ever.

For three years she has shunned sunbeds, opting for spray tans instead.

And when she is in natural sunlight on 
holiday, the 22-year-old uses factor 50 suncream and sits under 
umbrellas, avoiding the midday sun.

She is urging young people to avoid using sunbeds, instead opting for fake tan alternatives.

Dr
 Chris Steele, This Morning's resident doctor who himself had skin cancer twice as a result of using 
sunbeds 40 years ago before the dangers were widely known, said melanoma
 is detectable and more importantly preventable.

He urged people to watch out for changes
 to moles and freckles on their skin, watching for a change in size and 
colour, checking whether moles feel itchy, are bleeding or flaking.

The 22-year-old is now in remission and is urging other young people not to use harmful sunbeds, raising awareness of the dangers they pose

A recent 
survey by Cancer Research UK found people in Liverpool are at highest 
risk of being diagnosed with skin cancer, with 40 per cent of people 
admitting they use sunbeds at least once a week.

Gary
 Lipman, chair of the Sunbed Association told This Morning: 'The survey 
was undertaken soon after the law banning sunbed use by under 18s and 
the legislation has had a positive impact on underage use.

'Sunbed salons are full of pictures of 
beautiful women on the walls, it implies there are health benefits and 
there is lots of advertising saying vitamin D is good for your health'

'Our code of practice prohibits underage use as just one element of the screening process.

'Properly trained staff offer customers information about responsible use.'

Past surveys by Cancer Research UK in 2012 and 2009 linked sunbed use to an increased risk of getting skin cancer.

In 2012, an analysis of 27 studies revealed people have an increase in risk if they have ever used a sunbed. And the risk was highest for people who used a sunbed before the age of 35.

The 2009 study found people who have regularly used a sunbed before the age of 30 have a 75 per cent increase in their risk of developing melanoma.
