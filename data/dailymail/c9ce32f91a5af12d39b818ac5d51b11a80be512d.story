Inconsiderate drivers who 'park anywhere they want' are being shamed on a Facebook page set up by frustrated motorists in Australia.

Organisers of the 'Sydney C**p Parkers' page, designed to embarrass motorists who leave their cars in between parking bays or next to no standing signs into being more considerate, have been posting pictures since last July - and it has received hundreds of examples from around Sydney.

The Facebook page has received hundreds of examples from around Sydney, including the driver of this BMW (left) and the Ford stationwagon (right) couldn't decide which spot to park in - so chose both

The photos show drivers literally parking wherever and however they like including in between two or more spaces, across driveways and laneways and too close to other cars, pedestrian crossings and intersections.

The shamed drivers are given the opportunity to apologise in exchange for their embarrassing act to be taken down from the site that has been labelled 'Home of the Muppets and Wombats who can’t park!'

Evidence will be removed if shamed drivers apologise for their mishap

Deane said on his page that the site was designed for those 'who can’t read signs, can't judge distances or simply can't be bothered finding an actual parking space'.

'The roads are a public place,' he said. 'You need to be respectful of, and courteous to, all road users. After all, you might need that respect and courtesy extended to yourself one day.'
