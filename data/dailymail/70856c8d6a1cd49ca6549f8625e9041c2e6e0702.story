This is the moment an unimpressed pug finds a baby girl sat in his pet bed - triggering a closely contested tug-of-war.

A video submitted by an American YouTube user shows the infant named Meeghan happily sat in the sleeper.

The canine then enters the scene and proceeds to wrestle his bed back. At first he loops around the plush mattress gently pawing it.

He then tries another line of attack by grabbing the fabric with his teeth and shaking the baby out.

When that fails, the pug plops himself down alongside the baby.

'There you go, you guys can share,' a woman filming the fight says. 

But the pug isn't content with sharing and gets back up.
