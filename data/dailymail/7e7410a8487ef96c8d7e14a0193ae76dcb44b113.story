Four years ago, polygamist leader Warren Jeffs was sentenced to life in jail for sexually assaulting underage girls he considered his wives.

Despite this, he still appears to be running the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, or FLDS cult, and instructing his flock with letters and phone calls from behind bars.

Women and girls wearing prairie dresses can still be seen around town, pumping gas and driving tractors. They often run and hide when they see outsiders. Men drive trucks with windows tinted so dark you cannot tell who is inside.

Still there are signs that the community he once led on the border between Utah and Arizona is now divided - between those who remain loyal to Jeffs and those who wish to embrace the outside world.

The town of Hildale, which located in Utah, along with sister city Colorado City in Arizona, has seen some of its residents welcome modern society.

An elementary school, closed for 13 years, has reopened. As well, a mammoth, two-story edifice, encircled by a 15-foot wall of special white cement compound that members built for Jeffs, is being converted into a bed and breakfast.

Jeffs' former bodyguard, Willie Jessop, who for years defended the FLDS, is converting the former compound, which has dozens of rooms with turquoise carpets, just as Jeffs liked.

In defiance of some of Jeffs' rules, he flies the American flag, keeps the gate open and has torn down part of the wall - all meant as clear signals that there is life after Jeffs.

'To have it exposed that the leader was engaged in such horrific, immoral acts was a really dark place not only for me and my family but the entire community,' said Jessop, who left the cult in 2011.

'That's why you see such a fractured situation as people try to come to grips with what he's in prison for. It's easier for people to put it under religious persecution than the reality of why he's actually in there.' 

The group is a radical offshoot of mainstream Mormonism. Unlike most Mormons, members of FLDS believe polygamy will bring exaltation in heaven. Loyalists consider Jeffs a prophet who speaks for God and can do no wrong.

Jeffs has been in jail in Utah or Texas continually since 2006 but is believed to still rule the FLDS.

One of his brothers, Lyle Jeffs, is thought to ensure his commandments are carried out and his followers are roughly estimated to be about 6,000.

The Hildale and Colorado City town councils are believed to be filled with Jeffs loyalists.

Doran Jessop, a member of the FLDS and the Hildale City Council, said Jeffs is in prison for advocating the principles of Christ. Asked about the sexual assault convictions, he said if Jeffs has 'done anything like that, it was directed toward the Lord.'

The 190 pupils at the Hildale public school are only a fraction of the town's estimated 1,200 school-aged children as many sect members still follow Jeffs' edict to not to send their children to class.

But homes in the community which used to be controlled by a FLDS trust have been in the hands of government officials since 2005.

Around the corner from Jeffs former compound stand abandoned houses where the state recently evicted Jeffs followers who refused to pay $100-a-month occupancy fees.

About 24 families are now receiving deeds to their homes - a first for a community where nearly all the houses have belonged to sect leaders since 1942.

Katie Cox was one of people recently given deeds to their houses.

Cox, a long-time resident and member of the community's housing board, said sect leaders have been moving people from home to home for years.

The deeds are 'a symbol of freedom. It's a symbol that we are part of this United States,' said Cox, wearing modern clothes and listening to Frank Sinatra croon a Christmas song.

'For so long, it seemed like we had our own little Soviet Union here.'

Ms Cox, her husband, another wife and 21 combined children moved to the area in the late 1960s. Like many polygamous families who settled here, the Coxes fled Salt Lake City out of fear of prosecution under Utah's bigamy law. 

Echoing a common sentiment among defectors, she remembers a quaint little community during the 1970s and early 1980s.

By the time Jeffs and his father decided to move from the Salt Lake City area to the Utah-Arizona border, the Coxes had left the sect.

Jeffs took over after his father suffered a stroke and soon began ousting men from the sect.

Many were told they had broken church rules and were forced to leave their families, homes and belongings behind. So many young men have been forced out that they came to be known as the 'Lost Boys.' Their wives and children were reassigned.

Recently, in a series of lawsuits and court filings, federal and state officials have accused the towns of denying housing and municipal services to residents who live outside the sect and using the police to enforce discrimination.

A jury in Arizona recently ruled in favor of one family who sued over a denied water hookup. The couple is set to receive about $3million as a part of a settlement. A civil rights lawsuit filed by the U.S. Justice Department is pending.

At a  town hall meeting, organized by the Arizona attorney general in Colorado City, sheriff's deputies instructed people to call specific dispatch numbers, instead of 911, to ensure they get help from county authorities rather than town police who they say have a duty to FLDS leaders.

Attorneys for the towns have denied any wrongdoing and say there is no basis for the accusation.

Ron Rohbock was kicked out in 2002, despite having worked alongside Jeffs at the sect's school in the Salt Lake City area as vice principal.

The general contractor said he purchased $2million in supplies with his own line of credit to fix up homes in preparation for the massive move of people from Salt Lake to the Utah-Arizona border.

After he was ousted, he had to file for bankruptcy and contemplated suicide.

He eventually married a harpist in Las Vegas and traveled the world with her before she died. 

His new wife, a former therapist from Las Vegas, has helped him finally deal with the trauma he endured. 

The couple recently returned to Hildale to buy a large house Mr Rohbock and his sons helped build. The couple is fixing it up and hope to sell it. They don't plan to stay.

'I continually blamed myself and thought I was going to go to hell because they tell you that's exactly what's going to happen,' Mr Rohbock said.

'But I can tell you: This is hell. It can't get worse this. If this is heaven, you don't want anything to do with it.'

But Mrs Cox said: 'This is a nice place to live if you don't have somebody with their thumb on you telling you what you have to do,'

And more changes lie ahead. The public school plans to put a gymnasium in a giant building once used by the sect as a storehouse.

School officials want to field high school volleyball and basketball teams, with the hope that sports will convince more families to send their children to school.

More evictions of FLDS houses and businesses are scheduled and the new board may begin redistributing houses.

But nobody believes the Jeffs group will vanish anytime soon, if ever.

Doran Jessop was recently evicted after failing to pay occupancy fees on his house. He has no home or plan but remains a loyal follower of Jeffs.

'I don't know whether we are going to start living in tents or what we're going to do,' he said. 'Whatever it takes.'
