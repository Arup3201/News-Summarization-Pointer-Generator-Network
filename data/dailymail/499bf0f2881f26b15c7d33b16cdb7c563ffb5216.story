Wearing full traditional costumes 4,500 Germans in hats adorned with flowers march down a street brandishing rifles and clubs.

Then they stop for some schnapps.

This is the annual Patron Saint day festival in Bavaria.

For the first time this year, the German head of state, President Joachim Gauck, and his partner Daniela Schadt attended the event in which troops of Bavarian mountain riflemen show off their costumes.

In total, 47 companies from Berchtesgaden to Garmisch-Partenkirchen marched in their different uniforms during the parade.

The event was held in the rural town of Miesbach, which this year celebrates its first documentary mention 900 years ago.
