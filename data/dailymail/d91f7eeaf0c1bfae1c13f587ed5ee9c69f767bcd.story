Brainwave-controlled robot radiation suits could be used to protect engineers working in the disaster zone around the crippled Fukushima nuclear plant.

Researchers in Japan showed of the latest incarnation of HAL - Hybrid Assistive Limb - a full-body suit that allows wearers to don heavy radiation protection without feeling the burden.

HAL – coincidentally the name of the evil supercomputer in Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey – has a network of sensors that monitor the electric signals coming from the wearer's brain.

It uses these to activate the robot's limbs in concert with the worker's, taking weight off his or her muscles.

Poised: HAL on display at the Japan Robot Week exhibition yesterday. The new type of robot suits are to be used by workers at nuclear disaster sites and will be field tested at TEPCO's Fukushima power plant

Yoshiyuki Sankai, professor of engineering at the University of Tsukuba, said this means the 130lb (60kg) tungsten vest workers at Fukushima have to wear is almost unnoticeable.

He said the outer layer of the robot suit also blocks radiation, while fans inside it circulate air to keep the wearer cool, and a computer can monitor their heart-rate and breathing for signs of fatigue.

The robot is manufactured by 
Cyberdyne, a company unrelated to the fictional firm responsible for the
Terminator in the 1984 film of the same name.

HAL
was on display yesterday as part of Japan Robot Week, which also featured small 
robots that run on caterpillar tracks designed to move across difficult 
terrain and gather information in places where it is not safe for 
humans.

Cyberdyne have developed the technology for a range of purposes, including also as an assistive device for disabled people.

The company described the suit as a 'cyborg-type' robot that can supplement, expand or improve physical ability.

HAL works by scanning the user's skin to detect very weak traces of nerve signals sent by the brain to the muscles via motorneurons.

Based on the signals it receives, the device moves its joints in unison with wearers' muscle movements, supporting their daily activities.

Inventor Eiji Koyanagi of the Chiba Institute of Technology said the devices could be deployed very close to the damaged reactor core at Fukushima.

'We have to think of ways to protect nuclear workers, otherwise Fukushima won't be sorted out,' he said.

A huge tsunami in March 2011 smashed into the power plant, sparking meltdowns that forced the evacuation of a huge area of northeastern Japan.

The decommissioning of the crippled plant is expected to take several decades.
