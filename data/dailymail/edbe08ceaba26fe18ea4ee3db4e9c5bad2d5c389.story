Cristiano Ronaldo is an unrepeatable one-off, Jose Mourinho has told French Television channel TF1.

The Portuguese forward - who has assured supporters the ice-pack on his knee after Portugal’s defeat by France at the weekend was purely precautionary - has been hailed by the former Real Madrid coach he fell out with two seasons ago.

Mourinho said: ‘Cristiano is a goals machine. He is an incredible player. He is like (Zinedine) Zidane, there will never be another Ronaldo.’

Ronaldo has assured fans the ice pack on his knee after Portugal's defeat by France was purely precautionary

The record-breaking forward left Real Madrid fans with their hearts in their mouths on Saturday when he immediately applied ice to his troublesome left knee but the measure is now standard practice for Ronaldo designed to prevent any inflammation that might aggravate an on-going but controllable tendinitis problem.

Ronaldo spoke before the friendly that Portugal lost to France and repeated his desire to keep winning Ballon d’Or awards. He told Correio da Manha: ‘I am not going to pretend otherwise I would love to win my third Golden Ball. It doesn’t depend on me so I am just going to keep doing the best I can and let’s see what happens in January.

‘I have had a great start to the season and my scoring record is better than ever. I hope it’s going to be a year of great success on a team and individual level.’

Meanwhile, Real Madrid midfielder Toni Kroos insisted there is no better player in world football than Ronaldo.

The Real frontman has scored an impressive 17 goals in just 11 matches and Germany international Kroos, speaking to Die Welt, said: 'At the moment, there is no better player than Cristiano. He was one of those who looked out for me at first, he's a really nice guy.'

Having arrived from German champions Bayern Munich for a fee believed to be in the region of £24m, Kroos knows all about playing for one of Europe's top teams and insists the spirit in the Real Madrid camp is 'amazing'.

'I know what it means to play in a team with great individual quality,' said Kroos. 'We all respect each other, the spirit is amazing.

'I was lucky to come from a club with great standards. In Munich, it's more than stepping out on to the field to win - you start the season to win titles. So I didn't have to adapt a lot.

'I enjoy playing in Madrid. Although people may not believe me, it's a family club. I feel that people trust me.'
