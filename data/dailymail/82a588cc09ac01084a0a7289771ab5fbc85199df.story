The FN party, led by Marine Le Pen, entered the senate for the first time, securing two seats

France's far-right National front party was today celebrating a 'historic victory' as it won its first  seats in the upper house of parliament.

The party (FN), led by Marine Le Pen, entered the senate for the first time, securing two seats.

It was at the expense of Francois Hollande's struggling left-wing government, which is rapidly losing its grip on parliament. 

FN leader Le Pen, who is anti-immigration and anti-euro, said the election was a 'historic victory' for the party once synonymous with shaven-headed thugs and Third Reich nostalgia.  

She added: 'These results are beyond what we hoped for. Each day that passes, our ideas are increasingly being adopted by the French people. We have great potential.'

Stephane Ravier, one of the two newly elected FN senators, said: 'There is only one door left for us to push and it is that of the Elysee [presidential palace].' 

Half of the Senate's 348 seats were up for grabs in the election, with only some 158,000 people, the vast majority local councillors, able to vote.

The conservative UMP party of former President Nicolas Sarkozy and its centre-right ally, the UDI party, won 188 seats –13 seats more than needed for an absolute majority, according to the latest figures released early on Monday morning.

President Hollande's Socialist party still controls the National Assembly, or lower house. 

It comes after a strong showing by the far right in European elections in May. One in four French voters, or 25 per cent of the electorate, voted for the FN. 

The Socialists also suffered huge setbacks in municipal polls that saw the right make significant gains.

Many have accused Mr Hollande’s mismanagement of allowing extremists to flourish in a country where unemployment is now at 3.4 million

Recent opinion polls suggest President Hollande has become the most unpopular French president in modern times, with only 13 per cent of people saying they were satisfied with his performance. 

Many have accused Mr Hollande’s mismanagement of allowing extremists to flourish in a country where unemployment is now at 3.4 million. 

The FN are now even talking of victory in the 2017 presidential elections, when Le Pen will stand as head of state.

He has been hit by a recent cabinet revolt over austerity measures and criticised in a book by former first lady Valerie Trierweiler, who claimed the Socialist leader despised the poor, labelling them 'the toothless ones'.

The president has vehemently denied the allegation.

Marine Le Pen, right, was described as the 'ideal physical specimen for this part of France' by her father

As the daughter of a greatly reviled politician, Holocaust denier Jean-Marie Le Pen, Marine Le Pen grew up in an atmosphere of fear and intimidation. 

In 1976, aged eight, a bomb tore through the front of the family’s apartment building in Paris while she, her parents and two older sisters were asleep. They escaped unhurt.  

More trauma was to come when she was 16 and her mother, Pierrette, ran off with a reporter from Le Figaro newspaper who was writing a biography on her father.

Her parent’s bitter divorce was played out in the papers, and the French edition of Playboy.

It meant Jean-Marie was left to bring up his daughters alone and so Marine became closer to her father. 

At 18, she joined the Front National (indeed, all the Le Pen girls became active in the party).

After attending one of France’s top law schools, Marine Le Pen pursued a short career as a lawyer until 1998, when she ceased practising and became the head of the FN’s legal department.

Her devotion to the party has been blamed for her own inability to enjoy stable long-term relationships. Both her ex-husbands were in the Front National. She has three children and has been through two divorces. 

In her political career, she has attracted criticism for calling for the banning of the Jewish skullcap in public, saying that schools should be prevented from offering non-pork alternatives to Muslim and Jewish pupils and comparing Muslims praying in the streets outside overflowing mosques to the Nazi occupation of France in World War Two.
