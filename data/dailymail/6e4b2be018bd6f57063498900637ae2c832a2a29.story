Firehouse Fire: Several firefighters from Westchester and Putnam fire departments work to control the blaze

A firehouse in Westchester county, New York, was destroyed after it went up in flames in an accidental fire.

The fire broke out at the Goldens Bridge Fire Department building in the early morning, and the cause was believed to be faulty electrical wiring.

Because the building had an automatic hard-wired smoke detector, it alerted other departments in the surrounding area, allowing them to respond and put out the fire.

New York State Police said: 'At this time, the fire is believed to have originated from a faulty 
electrical connection to a fire truck while parked inside of the 
firehouse.

Fire Commissioner Edward Brancati said that he and another firefighter were inside the building when they smelled smoke coming from part of the building.

He said: 'There was a wall of smoke coming towards me and there was some sort of orange glow and then there was an explosion.

'It was very quick. I was stunned.

'We called 911. It’s embarrassing to call and say there’s a fire at your firehouse.'

Firefighters from several different districts all collaborated after being alerted in order to try and put out the fire

After they called 911, Brancati and the other firefighter started removing vehicles and equipment from the firehouse, before Brancati was overcome by smoke, and had to be taken to hospital.

It took tanker trucks from 17 other departments bringing in water to put out the fire, even after the entire 3,500-gallon tank at Goldens Bridge had been emptied.

It took more than two and a half hours for the crews from the different districts to completely extinguish the flames, and afterwards the 3,500 gallon tank had to be refilled at a local reservoir.

The fire caused significant structural damage to the firehouse, which has now been shut down until repairs can be carried out

In addition to structural damage to the building, a $500,000 fire truck and two 4x4 SUVs were destroyed by the fire. 

To help protect the area while repairs are carried out, Neighboring departments will cover Goldens Bridge’s territory, Haskell.
