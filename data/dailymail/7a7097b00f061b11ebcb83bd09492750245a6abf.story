CLICK HERE to read Martin Samuel's match report of Arsenal's impressive victory at the Etihad Stadium. 

One of the many reasons for Arsenal's lean years in the Barclays Premier League is their failure to do well against the really big teams. As such, this impressive victory at the Etihad Stadium was one to buck a miserable trend.

Prior to Sunday, Arsene Wenger's team had not beaten Manchester City in the league since April 2012.

They have not overcome Chelsea since October 2011 while, in terms of Manchester United, they have won only once since November 2008.

It is an astonishing record and says everything for the manner in which Arsenal have declined under Wenger over the last decade. Equally, however, it's a run of results that helps to put this one in to context. This was, in truth, as admirable as it was unexpected.

Here in wintery Manchester, Arsenal managed to produce a performance that contained much of what we expect from them and, crucially, some elements that we no longer do.

Wenger's team were as inventive in possession as ever. Santi Cazorla was the game's best player and, arguably, its most hard working. Equally, Arsenal were rapid on the counter attack.

Here, though, we also witnessed a performance of tactical shrewdness – especially in the first-half – as well as some stout defending and a well-taken goal from a set piece. These are things that we don't always see from a team that doesn't always seem capable of learning essons.

'Time will tell how important this is for us,' said Wenger. 'But this win increases the level of belief and the five months that are ahead of us now are very important to the life span of the team.'

The peculiar things about Wenger these days is that his rhetoric constantly sounds like that of the underdog. It's hard to think that this is the same coach who threatened to change the landscape of domestic English football when his team threatened the hegemony of United a little over ten years ago.

Yesterday Arsenal were competitive in every way and deserved their victory, regardless of the validity of the penalty that edged them in to an important lead.

When City had the ball Arsenal's midfield players closed the space in which the Premier League champions' more creative players like to work. Equally Arsenal were resolute at corners – City had sixteen – and the statistics show they won 61 per cent of the game's aerial contests.

That in itself if a remarkable recovery by a team that defended so horribly in losing at Southampton on New Year's Day , for example. The obvious question now is whether Arsenal can maintain this. It is, after all, something that has proved elusive for a long time.

'It helps that we have players back and fit,' said Wenger. 'From that point of view, this has been a very important period.'

As odd as it was to see Arsenal win with a degree of comfort, here, so it was to see City struggle. This was only the third time since November 2010 that City have failed to score in a home league game. Previously it happened against Stoke this season and Chelsea last.

They did have opportunities and on other occasions one would probably have gone in. Having said that, it is not unusual to see them struggle for persistent and progressive possession against teams with centrally creative players.

In recent times, they have laboured here against Barcelona, Chelsea, Bayern Munich and even AS Roma, for example, and there are occasions when the Brazilian central duo of Fernandinho and Fernando look a little short. Certainly, it does not bode well for the resumption of their Champions League campaign next month.

On Sunday, Cazorla and Aaron Ramsey passed the ball through the heart of the City midfield too easily. As such, Martin Demichelis and the returning Vincent Kompany found themselves exposed to Arsenal's runners. Both had rather uncomfortable afternoons.

Last night Manuel Pellegrini and his squad flew to Abu Dhabi for a week of warm weather training and a friendly against Hamburg. Beyond that, though, the champions have a home FA Cup tie against Middlesbrough and then, ominously, a league encounter at Chelsea.

Lose that one and City will have it all on to retain their title, regardless of the return of new signing Wilfried Bony later next month.

City are well in this race and are the kind of team that are capable of winning game after game, as they showed in winning eleven out of twelve prior to their recent draw at Everton.

One feels, though, that they must take a point from Chelsea at least to ensure two horses remain involved in this season's title race. That is a contest in which Arsenal were never likely to play a part, of course, but a place in the top four remains a feasible objective.
