From edge-to-edge, Saturn's ring system would be too big to fit in the distance between Earth and the moon.

But now a new ring system has been found that dwarfs Saturn's enormous structure – and it's the first of its kind to be seen outside our solar system.

Astronomers discovered more than 30 rings eclipsing the very young sun-like star J1407, each of them tens of millions of miles in diameter.

Astronomers have discovered more than 30 rings eclipsing the very young sun-like star J1407, each of them tens of millions of miles in diameter. There are gaps in the rings, which indicate that exomoons may have formed. Pictured is an artist's impression by www.black-cat-studios.com

The rings were first spotted in 2012 by the Leiden Observatory in the Netherlands, and the University of Rochester in New York.

A new analysis of the data, led by Leiden's Matthew Kenworthy, shows that there are gaps in the rings, which indicate that exomoons may have formed in the space.

'The details that we see in the light curve are incredible,' said Professor Kenworthy.

'The eclipse lasted for several weeks, but you see rapid changes on time scales of tens of minutes as a result of fine structures in the rings.

'The star is much too far away to observe the rings directly, but we could make a detailed model based on the rapid brightness variations in the star light passing through the ring system.

'If we could replace Saturn's rings with the rings around J1407b, they would be easily visible at night and be many times larger than the full moon.'

From edge-to-edge, Saturn's ring system (pictured here by the Cassini probe) would be too big to fit in the distance between Earth and the moon. But now a new ring system has been found that dwarfs Saturn's enormous structure – and it's the first of its kind outside our solar system

The astronomers analysed data from the Superwasp project – a survey that is designed to detect gas giants that move in front of their parent star.

Their conclusions is that the companion is likely to be a giant planet – not yet seen – with a gigantic ring system responsible for the repeated dimming of J1407's light.

The star is similar in mass to the sun, but is much younger.

Astronomers believe it to be about 16 million years old or 1/300th the age of the solar system.

It lies about 420 light years away.

There are more than 30 rings eclipsing the very young sun-like star.

Each of these rings tens of millions of miles in diameter.

If we could replace Saturn's rings with the rings around J1407b, they would be easily visible at night.

The mass of J1407b is most likely in the range of about 10 to 40 Jupiter masses.

The researchers encourage amateur astronomers to help monitor J1407.

They want to detect the next eclipse of the rings, to find out the definite mass of the ringed companion. 

The light curve tells astronomers that the diameter of the ring system is nearly 120 million kilometers, more than two hundred times as large as the rings of Saturn.

The ring system, 420 light years from Earth, likely contains roughly an Earth's worth of mass in light-obscuring dust particles.

Professor Eric Mamajek puts into context how much material is contained in these disks and rings.

'If you were to grind up the four large Galilean moons of Jupiter into dust and ice and spread out the material over their orbits in a ring around Jupiter, the ring would be so opaque to light that a distant observer that saw the ring pass in front of the sun would see a very deep, multi-day eclipse,' he said.

'In the case of J1407, we see the rings blocking as much as 95 per cent of the light of this young sun-like star for days, so there is a lot of material there that could then form satellites.'

In the data the astronomers found at least one clean gap in the ring structure, which is more clearly defined in the new model.

'One obvious explanation is that a satellite formed and carved out this gap,' said Professor Kenworthy.

'The mass of the satellite could be between that of Earth and Mars. The satellite would have an orbital period of approximately two years around J1407b.'

Astronomers expect that the rings will become thinner in the next several million years and eventually disappear as satellites form from the material in the disks.

'The planetary science community has theorised for decades that planets like Jupiter and Saturn would have had, at an early stage, disks around them that then led to the formation of satellites,' Professor Mamajek explains.

'However, until we discovered this object in 2012, no-one had seen such a ring system. This is the first snapshot of satellite formation on million-kilometer scales around a substellar object.'

Astronomers estimate that the ringed companion J1407b has an orbital period roughly a decade in length.

The mass of J1407b has been difficult to determine, but it is most likely in the range of about 10 to 40 Jupiter masses.

The researchers encourage amateur astronomers to help monitor J1407, which would help detect the next eclipse of the rings, and constrain the period and mass of the ringed companion.

Professor Kenworthy adds that finding eclipses from more objects like J1407's companion 'is the only feasible way we have of observing the early conditions of satellite formation for the near future.

'J1407's eclipses will allow us to study the physical and chemical properties of satellite-spawning circumplanetary disks.'

'The details that we see in the light curve are incredible,' said Professor Kenworthy. 'The eclipse lasted for several weeks, but you see rapid changes on time scales of tens of minutes as a result of fine structures'
