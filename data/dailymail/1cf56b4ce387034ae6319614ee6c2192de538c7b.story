Seven Colombians accused of involvement in the stabbing death of a U.S. drug agent have been handed over to American authorities.

The men were delivered to U.S. officials Tuesday at a police base in the capital city of Bogota.

The men have been indicted in the U.S. on charges that they murdered 43-year-old DEA agent James 'Terry' Watson in Bogota in 2013.

USA-bound: Police present to the press seven Colombians accused in the killing of US Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) agent James Terry Watson, who was stabbed to death during a robbery in June 2013

The seven men involved in the murder of Watson on June 20 last year in Bogota will be presented before Court of East District Virgina for intentional murder of a protected person and other crimes

Killed: James 'Terry' Watson was murdered by a gang of kidnappers in Bogota in Colombia. Seven men accused of the murder will now stand trial in Virginia after being extradited Tuesday

Authorities say they posed as taxi drivers, and were trying to take Watson on what's called a 'millionaire's ride', in which criminals force victims to remove cash from ATMs.

Watson was on assignment in Colombia and had been watching the NBA finals at a bar in Bogota on June 30, 2013.

He left and hailed a cab, but the taxi was a fake.

Typically robbers drug the victims and take them to different ATM machines to withdraw cash.

At a stop light, Watson's cab was approached by another car and two men, who were part of the 'paseo millonario', jumped in, according to CBS.

Watson attempted to fight back and was stabbed, authorities said.

He ran out of the cab, collapsed and died from his wounds.

The crime is also referred to as 'express kidnapping'.

U.S. and Colombian officials believe the killing was unrelated to Watson's drug enforcement role.

The suspects were identified as Wilson Peralta, Edgar Murillo, Hector Lopez, Edwin Figueroa, Omar Valdes, Julio Ramirez and Andres Oviedo.

They are expected to stand trial in the U.S. District Court in Alexandria, Virginia.

Their families are protesting that they did not have an opportunity to say goodbye to the men.

However Colombian press reports have linked the group to more than 50 such robberies.

Police investigators say they have evidence against the men taken by 40 different video surveillance cameras.

Watson can reportedly be seen on the footage running from the cab.

There is also said to be footage of the suspects washing blood stains from the cab at a taxi terminal the following day.

Colombian police Gen. Ricardo Restrepo said Tuesday that the seven men were among 94 Colombians extradited so far this year to stand trial in foreign countries, Fox News reported.

The suspects were eligible for extradition because Watson was living and working in Colombia with diplomatic status, U.S. officials claimed.Â 

They said the Vienna convention enabled the transfer.
