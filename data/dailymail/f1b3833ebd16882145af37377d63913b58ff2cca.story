Wedding bells: Victoria Cross recipient Cpl Johnson Beharry, 33, and girlfriend Mallissa Venice Noel, 27, who he will wed tomorrow

Victoria Cross hero Corporal Johnson Beharry, who saved the lives of 30 soldiers in Iraq, will marry his glamorous dentist girlfriend tomorrow following a whirlwind romance.

Cpl Beharry and Mallissa Venice Noel, whose relationship only became known in November, will be joined by the Army Wives Choir, who will entertain guests at the reception.

The 33-year-old soldier will arrive at Westminster Register Office in London in military uniform for the 11am ceremony. A further ceremony will be held at the Queen's Chapel of Savoy, also in London.

The reception will be at University College London's Senate House and staff will donate their wages to Armed Force charity Help for Heroes, according to The Sun.

Miss Noel, 27, who comes from Cpl Beharry's native Grenada, described her boyfriend as 'wonderful' when she first appeared on his arm at a charity event last year.

Cpl Beharry hinted a wedding would be forthcoming, when he added: 'Yes, I think we are heading in that direction.'

He is marrying for a second time, having split from first wife Lynthia in 2005 - blaming the trauma of his war experiences.

The break up came just days after Cpl
 Beharry received the highest military honour for gallantry from the 
Queen at Buckingham Palace.

The
 medal was awarded for two acts of bravery performed by Cpl Beharry when
 he was a private with 1st Battalion, the Princess of Wales's Royal 
Regiment in 2004.

The first came in May when he led an ambushed patrol to safety, despite coming under heavy fire in a Warrior armoured vehicle.

One
 month later, Cpl Beharry saved a further eight soldiers despite 
suffering face and brain injuries when a grenade exploded inches from 
his head.

He has previously revealed how the 
stress of his experiences led him to attempt suicide by driving his car 
into a lamp post at more than 100mph.

The
 soldier also snubbed the then Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, by refusing
 to shake his hand at a Remembrance Day service in 2009.

Cpl Beharry, whose medal was the first Victoria Cross to be awarded in more than 30 years, said he was furious with Mr Brown for fidgeting during the two-minute silence.

The
 wedding comes after it was revealed that L/Cpl James Ashworth, 23, will
 be awarded the medal after being killed in Afghanistan last year while 
protecting his colleagues.
