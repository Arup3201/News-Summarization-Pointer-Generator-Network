Kumar Sangakkara dismissed talk of prolonging his one-day international career after becoming the first man to hit centuries in four consecutive ODIs as Sri Lanka swept aside Scotland.

The 37-year-old is due to retire from the 50-over game following the World Cup, but proved on Wednesday that he is still an elite performer at the top level with his 124 against Scotland following on from tons against Australia, England and Bangladesh.

Sangakkara's sublime knock helped his side hammer the minnows by 148 runs. He was instrumental in making 363-9 before the Scots were bowled out for 215.

Next week's quarter-final could therefore be his final ODI outing but, despite his prolific form, Sangakkara insists he will not play on after the tournament Down Under.

'It is never about whether you can play or not,' he told the BBC's Test Match Special. 'Retirement is not about form, it is about time and place and whether it feels right.'

The wicketkeeper admitted in the post-match presentations following the 148-run win against the Scots that his body was finding it harder and harder to cope with the demands of modern cricket.

'It becomes hard, of course, now that I'm 37,' he said. 'I get a bit slower, the joints start creaking and aching.

'I'm pretty happy that I'm still playing, I consider myself pretty lucky to be part of such a good side.

'When everything is going well, things look bright.'

Sangakkara has scored 14,189 runs in 403 one-day internationals, adding 12,203 in 130 Test matches in a near 15-year international career.

After beginning steadily, Sangakkara accelerated as Scotland struggled to contain him. He cleared the ropes four times and added 13 fours, reaching his ton with a prod through third man. He eventually fell edging Josh Davey to wicket-keeper Matthew Cross.

Angelo Mathews plundered 51 from 21 balls down the innings, including sixes from each of the four deliveries he faced immediately before being dismissed when going for another maximum - caught just inside the ropes by Freddie Coleman off the final ball of Matt Machan's costly fourth and final over.  

The 37-year-old also hit 100 against Bangladesh, Australia and England earlier in the tournament
