When car crash victim Natalie Lander came out a coma, she was given news which left her torn between joy and terror.

With her own life still hanging in the  balance from a broken back and brain injuries, doctors announced she had been four weeks pregnant at the time of the accident – even though the mother of one believed she was unable to have any more children.

It was still unclear whether she would walk or talk properly again, and doctors recommended she consider a termination.

But Mrs Lander, 31, and husband Marcus
 were not willing to give up so easily – and a year on, having amazed 
doctors with her progress, she has given birth to a healthy boy named 
Max.

Mrs Lander’s car spun out of control on a wet manhole cover as she drove to work in July 2011.

Her back was broken in four places and
 her neck in two, and she also sustained a smashed pelvis, damage to her
 vocal cords and brain injuries.

She was cut out of the car and 
airlifted to hospital, where doctors told her husband, a 37-year-old 
civil engineer, that they didn’t know if she would survive.

But she came
 out of a coma, and doctors carried out a routine scan to check she was 
not pregnant before starting further treatment – and it showed that she 
was.

It was all the more surprising because Mrs Lander has Polycistic Ovary Syndrome, which makes it difficult to conceive.

She has a four-year-old son, Alfie, 
but thought she couldn’t become pregnant again.

Mrs Lander, from 
Walsall, said: ‘When I found out I was pregnant, I was torn between 
being overjoyed and terrified.

'I was so worried that Alfie wouldn’t have
 a mum who could look after him properly, let alone another baby.

‘The doctors recommended that we could consider terminating the pregnancy, but we wanted to fight for our baby.’

She added: ‘I was terrified that the 
accident would somehow have affected my baby.

'I was paralysed down my 
left hand side, and could barely speak in more than a whisper because of
 the damage to my vocal cords – nobody could tell me how far I would 
recover.’

While pregnant, Mrs Lander underwent four months of  intensive physiotherapy, which helped her learn how to walk and talk again.

‘I was trying to concentrate on getting myself better, but I was so worried about the little baby growing inside me,’ she said.

‘Medics kept telling me he would be 
fine, but I wouldn’t believe it until I held him in my arms.’

Max was 
born in March, and after a lot of hard work both mother and baby are 
doing well.

Mrs Lander has even gone back to her job in sales a few days
 a week.

Doctors are thrilled at their 
progress, although they have warned it will take Mrs Lander another year
 before she is fully recovered.

But she added: ‘I can’t ever thank them enough for saving my family.’
