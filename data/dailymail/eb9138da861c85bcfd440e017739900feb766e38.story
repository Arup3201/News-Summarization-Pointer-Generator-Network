Rory McIlroy now has something else that that once belonged to Tiger Woods - the cover of EA Sports' latest video game.

Electronic Arts Inc. announced on Monday that McIlroy will be the new face of its golf series. 

'EA Sports Rory McIlroy PGA Tour' is to be released in June and will be the first EA Sports series to use the new Frostbite technology that provides sharper pictures and eliminates load times between holes.

Woods had been on the front cover of EA Sports PGA Tour golfing game franchise for 16 years

'I'm very proud and humbled to see my face and name on EA SPORTS Rory McIlroy PGA TOUR,' said McIlroy.

'This is a great honour, and something I couldn't even dream of growing up playing the sport.'

EA Sports built its PGA Tour series around Woods from 1998 until it ended its relationship with him in 2013 when Woods was still No 1 in the world. 

McIlroy has been No 1 since August and the pair  shared the cover in 2011.

The game will be available for Xbox One and PlayStation 4.
