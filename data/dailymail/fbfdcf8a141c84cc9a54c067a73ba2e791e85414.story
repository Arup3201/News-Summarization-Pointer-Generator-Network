A grandmother with an arthritis-ridden leg is begging her hospital trust to cut it off after years of agony.

Elaine Denton, 52, from Clayton, Manchester, is so frustrated she says she would cut off the limb herself if she had the courage.

She began suffering with crippling arthritis five years ago and has already had three knee replacement operations on her left leg.

She has also had three operations cancelled by North Manchester General.

Elaine Denton, 52, from Clayton, Manchester, is in a row with her hospital trust because they refuse to allow her to have her leg amputated

The grandmother has had three knee replacements and several operations after being diagnosed with crippling athritis

Fed up of the pain and disappointment from failed operations, she now wants her leg amputated.

Mrs Denton said: 'I don't even get dressed any more. I live in my pyjamas and slippers.

'The last operation they said they were putting the Rolls-Royce of knee replacements in but I can't even lift it.

Mrs Denton's first operation was in 2008, when keyhole surgery to diagnose arthritis left her with an infection

'I've been asking since 2012 for them to amputate my leg and they won't do it.

'What's the point in them keeping on putting knee replacements in when it's just not working?

'I just want it amputated. If I had the guts to I'd cut it off myself.'

Mrs Denton's first operation was in 2008, when keyhole surgery to diagnose arthritis left her with an infection.

After a knee replacement in 2011 she was unable to walk or lift her leg.

Two further replacements in 2012 and 2013 were also unsuccessful. She says the hospital has also cancelled three operations.

'It's driving me doolally,' she said. I have two grand kids I can't play with. It's getting me down so much.'

Elaine, who suffers from rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis, has just been told she now has the condition in her right leg.

Her husband Alan Eaton, 41, quit his job as a security guard to become her full-time carer.

The mother of four added: 'I feel guilty because he has to do everything round the house.'

A spokesman for The Pennine Acute Hospitals NHS Trust said: 'We have not received a complaint from Mrs Denton, although she has been in contact with our Patient Advice and Liaison Service (PALS) in October regarding some questions about a previous appointment.

'We are unable to comment further about Mrs Denton's personal circumstances or treatment due to patient confidentiality, but our consultant is fully aware of her case and is also in correspondence with her GP about her care plan and clinical treatment.

'We understand Mrs Denton is due to attend our hospital in the next few weeks.'
