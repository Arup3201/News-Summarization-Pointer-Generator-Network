The Labor leader Bill Shorten distanced himself from the president of the Northern Territory Labor Party on Monday, saying he ‘made a mistake’ after reports surfaced that he had travelled to the Middle East to fight Islamic State. 

NT Labour leader Matthew Gardiner left Australia to reportedly join the fight against the Islamic State militants in the Middle East. Mr Shorten, who has met the union organiser, said joining the conflict was a mistake.

'Whatever the guy's motivations, you're not going to solve things by going there,' Mr Shorten told Fairfax Radio.

Labor leader Bill Shorten labelled NT Labour leader Matthew Gardiner's decision to join the fight against Islamic State militants as a 'mistake'

'He obviously feels very strongly about fighting ISIL but I don't think it's the right way to go about it, just to up sticks.

'I think he's made a mistake.'

Mr Gardiner has been stood down as president and his Labor membership suspended amid media reports he has travelled to Iraq or Syria and plans to join Kurdish militants fighting against Islamic State. 

The 43-year-old has an army background, and reportedly served as an Australian Army combat engineer in Somalia in the early 1990s. He recently resigned as NT United Voice union secretary.

Mr Gardiner was allowed to leave the country because he was not on any watch list, ABC reported. 

Around 90 Australians are understood to have travelled to the Middle East to join militant causes

The Australian Federal Police (AFP) confirmed it is investigating the case after the former NT union official and senior NT Labor party figure left the country. 

'The AFP is aware of this matter,' an AFP spokesperson said on Sunday.

'As this matter is part of an ongoing investigation it is not appropriate to comment further.'

A union spokesperson would only confirm Mr Gardiner had recently resigned, and said any further questions should be put to the AFP.  

Attorney General George Brandis has received an AFP brief on the Gardiner case.

A spokesperson for Mr Brandis said Australians who join militant causes overseas face imprisonment should they survive and return.

'If you fight illegally in overseas conflicts, you face up to life in prison upon your return to Australia,' the spokesperson said.

'It is illegal to fight in Syria for either side of the conflict.

'It is illegal to fight for a terrorist organisation anywhere, including in Iraq.'

Australians who wanted to oppose the actions of the Islamic State group should instead donate to humanitarian groups operating in affected areas, the spokesperson said.
