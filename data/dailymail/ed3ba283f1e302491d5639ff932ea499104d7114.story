Guilty: Jamila Williams will serve at least eight years in prison after admitting having sex with four pupils, all aged between 15 and 16

A math teacher has been jailed for at least eight years after having sex with four teenage pupils in her class.Â 

Jamila Williams, 36, admitted four counts of criminal sex conduct relating to sexual encounters with two 15-year-olds and two 16-year-old boys.

In return for her guilty plea, three more criminal sexual conduct charges against her were dropped.

At a hearing in Michigan this week, Williams was told she will serve a minimum term of eight years but that her sentence could be extended to 15 years.

Williams taught at the Grand Rapids University Prep Academy, in Grand Rapids, Michigan.

She was charged this year after two male students, aged 15 and 16, told police they had a series of inappropriate encounters with the teacher.

After the original reports became public, a further two pupils came forward and reported similar stories.

Investigators said Williams had sex with the boys in a string of different locations which included one alleged victim's home, a restaurant and in a car.

Williams had been a member of staff at the Grand Rapids University Prep Academy for the last four years.

She has four children of her own and two stepchildren between the ages of three and 19.

As well as being suspended from her job, Williams has been banned from having unsupervised contact with children younger than 16.

At Kent County Circuit Court this week, the teacher apologized 
and asked for forgiveness for her crimes but said she refused the allegation that she 'preyed' on her victims.

Judge 
Paul Sullivan says the harm Williams brought to the school, students and
 her family is 'incalculable.'
