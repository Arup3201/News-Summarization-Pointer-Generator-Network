President Barack Obama's 2016 budget proposal is as silly as a comedy sketch, a Senate leadership aide told Daily Mail Online on Monday.

'This $4 trillion budget is the silliest thing since Monty Python,' the senior staffer said, recalling the British funnymen's 'Ministry of silly walks' routine.

'The only think about it that isn't funny is that the president thinks it's serious.' 

There was no shortage of budgetary body-slams on Capitol HIll as the GOP panned the White House's dramatic budget, which another Senate aide officially declared 'DOA – that's Dead On Arrival.'

SILLY STUFF: Congressional Republican aides called Obama's budget 'bizarre,' 'ridiculous' and 'dead on arrival'

Obama plugged his $4 trillion budget for 2016 during a speech to Homeland Security staffers in Washington

He castigated the White House for rolling a 'union make-work jobs' proposal into the budget, citing a $478 billion public works program that promises to repair crumbling highways, bridges and public transit systems.'

Programs like that typically benefit Democrats' powerful labor union constituency.

Both aides spoke on condition of anonymity so they could reflect what the first one called 'the true mood up here on the Hill.'

'It's bizarre and ridiculous, rolled up in a package of idiotic,' he said.

Republican lawmakers who spoke on the record were more circumspect but equally dismissive.

'This proposal isn't really a budget at all – it is a messaging piece,' said Tennessee Rep. Diane Black.

'This so-called budget ignores both the reality of our already crippling $18 trillion national debt and of a new Republican majority in Washington that will not allow this laughable tax-and-spend proposal to pass.'

'Ministry of Silly Walks' – Monty Pythons's Flying Circus  

Black claimed that the president's proposal adds a whopping ''$2.1 trillion in new tax increases, on top of $1.7 trillion in tax hikes already imposed by the administration.'

Those tax hikes, totaled over ten years, wouldn't balance Obama's budget in 2016, however, as it still leaves a $474 billion deficit. 

'President Obama likes to talk about his veto pen,' Indiana Sen. Dan Coats told Politico, 'and with the release of this budget, we can only conclude that he writes with red ink.' 

The budget's tax rate on capital gains – investment income – would be the highest in 19 years.

Obama is demanding a 7 per cent increase in domestic spending and the defense budget, undoing the fiscal restraint that marked the 2011 budget deal.

Obama called those cuts 'mindless austerity.' 

Rep. Diane Black, shown Jan. 27 during a House Budget Committee hearing, said Obama's budget is a 'laughable tax-and-spend proposal'

Sen. Dan Coatas (left) said Obama's legendary veto pen 'writes with red ink,' while Rep. Scott Garrett (right) joked about Groundhog Day and recurring unbalanced budgets

New Jersey Rep. Scott Garrett said in a statement that 'it's fitting that President Obama released his budget on Groundhog Day because it's a painful repeat of the same failed policies that he has presented to Congress for the past six years.'

That's a reference to the Bill Murray movie, in which he is forced to relive the same day over and over again.

Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader of the upper house of Congress, summed up the GOP's complaints. 

'What we saw this morning was another top-down, backward-looking document that caters to powerful political bosses on the Left and never balances – ever.'

Republicans now control both houses of COnrgess for the first time in Obama's presidency. 

Asked to say something nice about the hefty budget book that arrived to great fanfare on Capitol Hill this morning, one House committee staffer said: 'It's still winter, so my fireplace will like it.'
