A Connecticut man who went to great lengths to prevent police from seeing the test results of his DWI breathalyser has found himself in even more trouble.

Charged: Authorities said Kenneth Desormes was arrested about 5:30 a.m. Sunday

Kenneth Desormes, 40, of Greenwich, was pulled over for speeding on Interstate 95 in Port Chester, north of New York City at 5:30 a.m. Sunday.

He was quickly arrested on suspicion of being drunk, NBC New York reported.

But when it came time to do some paperwork at the state police barracks in Tarrytown, Desormes allegedly became apprehensive.

Police say that as his breathalyzer tests results were processing, Desormes grabbed the printout and quickly tried to eat it.

However he wasn't quite fast enough. 

The results that hadn't been chewed through revealed Desormes had a blood alcohol content of 0.13 percent, police said.

In Connecticut you are considered to be legally intoxicated if you have a BAC (blood alcohol concentration) of .08 or higher.

Desormes was charged with the misdemeanors driving while intoxicated, second-degree obstructing governmental administration and third-degree criminal tampering.

It is unclear whether Desormes was remanded to jail, released with an appearance ticket, or released on bail or bond.

Test: Police say as they were printing Desormes' DWI results at the station, he grabbed the test and tried to eat it. It showed a reading of 0.13 percent
