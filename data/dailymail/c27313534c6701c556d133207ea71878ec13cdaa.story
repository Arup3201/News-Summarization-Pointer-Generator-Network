Aston Villa are confident a deal can be done to bring in Scott Sinclair from Manchester City.

Paul Lambert admitted last week the transfer looked 'dead' but talks have since been revived and a conclusion is edging closer.

A loan switch until the end of the season with a view to a permanent move in the summer seems the likeliest outcome at this stage.

The 25-year-old played on loan at West Brom last season but failed to make an impact 

Villa baulked at City's initial price tag of £4million earlier this window as the champions insisted on a permanent transfer.

It is believed that stance has softened, as well as a more palatable fee for Villa being on the table.

Negotiations are ongoing and Lambert is understood to be hopeful terms can be thrashed out in time for the trip to Arsenal on Sunday.
