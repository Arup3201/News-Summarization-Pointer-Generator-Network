There will be some Manchester United supporters that take the view that no Liverpudlian should ever captain this famous club. Let alone one, in Wayne Rooney, that has twice agitated for a transfer in the past four years.

This particular Scouser has, however, now spent ten years with Manchester United, happens to be the club's 3rd highest goalscorer and is also likely to break Sir Bobby Charlton's all-time record of 249 goals in the coming seasons.

Wayne Rooney is the pragmatic selection for Van Gaal at a time when this football club is not blessed with true leaders. Rio Ferdinand, Nemanja Vidic, Patrice Evra and Ryan Giggs have all vacated the dressing-room this summer and United have lost over 2,000 appearances worth of experience in just a few months from the squad's playing-staff.

When Manchester United fall behind - not once, but twice - at Old Trafford, it is to these experienced minds, who have recovered in the face of adversity so many times, that the players would usually look.

Following the mass exodus of the veterans this summer and a host of first-team players - Robin van Persie and Danny Welbeck in particular - unavailable, this was always going to be a tricky afternoon for Louis van Gaal.

On Saturday lunchtime against Swansea, with so many young or fringe players in the side, the onus was on the newly-appointed captain Wayne Rooney to step forward. Rooney has always been vocal on the pitch, urging his defence up the field and demanding more from those around him. Such burning ambition will only intensify with the armband.

In the first-half, as United curiously toiled without purpose in Van Gaal's favoured 3-5-2 system, Rooney struggled to influence the game, unable to find space either deep or in the final third. It did not help his case that those around him - principally Juan Mata and Javier Hernandez - were so ineffective, barely peeping out of a cloak on anonymity.

The change to 4-4-1-1 in the second half afforded Rooney greater room and he was central to United's efforts, acrobatically turning home a Juan Mata corner and linking intricately with Adnan Januzaj as Van Gaal's team sought to overturn the 1-0 deficit.

Just a few moments before Swansea retook the lead through Gylfi Sigurdssson, a Rooney free-kick curled around the wall and clipped the outside of the post. That, sadly, was his last contribution of note. On this frustrating afternoon, Rooney's most eye-catching work was of perspiration, rather than inspiration.

As the clock ticked down and United surrendered timidly, Rooney tried to motion his team forward. Ultimately, the quality just was not there and that, sadly, is a damning indictment of the situation Van Gaal has inherited at Manchester United.
