Three people have been reported killed and three others injured following a shooting at an off-campus housing complex at Auburn University in what is believed to have been a fight over a girl.

Among the dead were former Auburn students and football players Ed Christian and LaDarius Phillips. A third student at the school, Demario Pitts, 20, was also killed.

Police identified their killer as Desmonte Leonard, 22, who has been charged with capital murder. He has not yet been captured.

He said he and Pitts were approached by two other men who started arguing with them over a woman.

Vines said he punched one of the men, while Pitts hit both of the men over the head with a bottle. 

Then, one of them started shooting, he said.

Police Chief Tommy Dawson told Al.com: 'I'd like to reach out to Mr. Leonard to turn himself in today.'

Vines said he had never before seen the men who he had been arguing with.

'It's like I lost a lung,' Vines said of his friend. 'I don't know how I'm going to survive this.'

Crime scene: A police officer stands guard at the scene of an overnight shooting at the University Heights apartment complex

Several emergency vehicles had 
converged overnight around the University Heights apartment complex 
where reports indicated a number of students who attend Auburn 
University typically reside.

The building was swathed in yellow police tape.

The shooting happened in an archway near the apartment complex information center, near the edge of the parking lot.

Mack,
 the wounded player, is a junior offensive lineman from St. Matthews, 
South Carolina. He played in five games last season. Coach Gene Chizik said Mack 
was expected to make a full recovery.

Christian
 is an offensive lineman who was out last season while dealing with a 
back injury. Phillips was a backup fullback. Chizik said in April that 
Phillips had decided to give up football.

Residents have been prevented from leaving or entering the complex until police have made further investigations

Five uniformed officers guarded the 
area, which was sealed off with crime scene tape, and a handful of crime
 scene investigators were at work.

After
 daybreak Sunday, several uniformed officers stood near a disaster 
relief trailer parked at the building's entrance, which appeared to be a
 sort of command center. 

Some bystanders milled about, looking on at the scene.

In an attempt to protect the crime scene police had erected a tent while forensic officers carry out their investigations.
