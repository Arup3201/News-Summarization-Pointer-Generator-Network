Bad steer: Robin Lovelock, 65, spent four years building Snoopy Sloop and hoped it would be the first vessel to complete a 3,600-mile journey unaided

A retired scientist spent four years building a toy boat he hoped would be the first to cross the Atlantic unaided - only to see it crash after six miles.

Robin Lovelock, 65, waded into the sea in his trousers to launch Snoopy Sloop from Barton-on-Sea, Hants, on a 3,600-mile journey to the U.S.

But the four-foot vessel sailed just six miles in seven hours before crashing into the Needles off the western tip of the Isle of Wight.

The 30lb boat, which has a top speed of just three knots, was constructed for 
less than £450 in Mr Lovelock's games room in Sunninghill, Berkshire.

It features solar panels on the deck that power a GPS receiver, a small computer, and a turbo, which control the metre-high sails and rudder.

Mr Lovelock tracked the journey on the internet from a laptop after his boat set sail at 11.30am, but watched in horror as winds carried the boat straight into the rocks.

He then lost contact with Snoopy Sloop at 6.45pm after the motion of the waves repeatedly bashed it against the rocks, breaking the onboard GPS.

The former senior scientist for NATO now hopes a member of the public will be able to rescue the boat so he can try again.

He said: 'It was always going to be tough so I am not too downhearted.

'Hopefully somebody will find Snoopy and return her to us so we can give her a quick dusting down and send her back on her way.

'She made good progress for the first two hours but then we noticed she was heading straight for the Needles, where she is wrecked.

'The repeated bashing against the rocks has unfortunately broken the GPS receiver. It’s possible water has got on board.'

Seafaring adventure: The 1.3-metre boat only managed seven hours before crashing into the Needles off the western tip of the Isle of Wight

Tiny craft: The 30lb boat, which has a top speed of just three knots, was constructed for less than £450 in Mr Lovelock's games room

He added: 'If we had launched her just a few hundred yards further west or half an hour earlier she would have probably missed the Needles and be well on her way now.'

If the boat had survived the six-month journey to Maine, it would have been the first robotic boat to complete the transatlantic trip.

The technology should have worked to keep the 10kg boat on a a pre-defined route, mapped out by Mr Lovelock.

He started work on his project four years ago, assisted by six friends called the Last of the Summer Wine Team, one of whom appeared on BBC programme Robot Wars.

Challenge: The 65-year-old had hoped to make history by building the first unmanned vessel to cross the Atlantic

Labour of love: Mr Lovelock has spent four years crafting the four foot boat at a cost of around £450

The boat has previously already sailed 5,000 miles, albeit in the comparatively still waters of Bray Lake near Windsor.

He said before the launch: 'It will be a tough trip with lots of obstacles to trip us up along the way.

'The boat will have to negotiate large waves, strong winds and even curious dolphins.

'However, our research and testing will hopefully give us a fighting chance.'

Mr Lovelock made prototypes using items he had bought on auction website eBay.

A model of cartoon character Snoopy was fitted to the front of the boat.

Resilient: Robin's craft has already sailed around 5,000 miles, albeit on the still waters of Bray Lake near Windsor

Construction: Robin has been helped by a team of friends, including a veteran of BBC's Robot Wars

It was due to head west along the English Channel from the Hampshire coastline, south towards the Azores to catch the trade winds, then to the Bahamas and on to the USA.

A team from Aberystwyth University 
attempted the first transatlantic crossing in September 2010 setting 
sail from Valentia, County Kerry, Ireland.

But the team lost its track of the craft off the north west coast of Ireland.

The challenge has been attempted three times since 2010, with all three attempts failing.

Three more attempts have been registered for this year.
