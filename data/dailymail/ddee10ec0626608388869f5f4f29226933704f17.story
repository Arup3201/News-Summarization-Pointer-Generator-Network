Team news

Chelsea

Diego Costa is fit for Chelsea's return to Premier League action but Jose Mourinho has yet to make a decision on whether Cesc Fabregas will face West Brom.

The pair missed Spain's recent internationals but Mourinho says striker Costa has 'fully recovered' from hamstring and groin complaints, while Fabregas is in contention after returning to training on Friday after a minor thigh tear.
