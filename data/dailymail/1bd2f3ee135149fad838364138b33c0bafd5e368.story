As if losing his mother wasn't enough.

Just two weeks after his mother was slain in an apparent murder-suicide, Aaron Knudsen lost her car as well.

Toyota seized the 2003 Camry from an impound lot where police had sent it on the day of the slaying May 17, though Knudsen's mother, 44-year-old Denise Fransua, of Denver, Colorado, had no late payments on the car.

Still grieving, Knudsen, 24, and his 17-year-old sister, began what he said proved to be the long and frustrating process of reclaiming their mother's Camry.

'I'm just a 24-year-old guy, my sister is 17. She just graduated high school. My mom is a single mom and all this is too much,' Knudsen told NBC/9News.

Knudsen says he spent days on the phone with unhelpful Toyota representatives and made a first payment to show he was serious about getting the car back.

Knudsen's slain mother wasn't late on payments for the 2003 Camry, but he was told he'd have to pay the remainder of the loan -- plus nearly $1,600 in fees -- to get the car back

Toyota, however, told him he'd have to pay the entire $3,400 left on the loan in full by July 5 -- as well as the almost $1,600 impound fee -- if he ever wanted to see his mother's car again.

When he protested, Knudsen told CBS4 that representatives from the car company simply said, 'This is what the state allows us to do.'

Finally, Knudsen had had enough. The tech-savvy young adult took his grievances directly to Toyota's corporate Facebook page.

Virtually overnight, his tragic story caught the attention -- and the ire -- of thousands of users and went viral.

'Shame on you Toyota,' one of the posts read, as noted by NBC/9News. 'To do this to a murdered single mother and her son is beyond words,' read another. 'Prepare to lose business.'

Toyota later apologized on its corporate Facebook page

Toyota, perhaps embarrassed, relented Thursday. They agreed to waive the fees and work with Knudsen to help him get his mother's car back. According to CBS4, he'll still have to pay the $3,300 left on the loan, however.

 'We want to convey our sincere apology that yesterday we were not sensitive to the extraordinary circumstances leading to this car being impounded,' Toyota said in a written statement Thursday.

The car company took to Facebook to apologize as well. 'To those of you who posted on our wall regarding a recent customer’s family repossession: We are incredibly sorry for the loss this family has suffered and are working directly with the family to rectify the issue. Thank You.'

Knudsen says he's relieved, but is still in mourning over the one thing he will never be able to get back: his mother. 'She was the best mom you could think of,' he told NBC/9News. 'I'll miss her smile the most.'
