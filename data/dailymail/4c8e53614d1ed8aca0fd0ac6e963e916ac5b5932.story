Labour leader Ed Miliband dubbed the Prime Minister 'clueless' today as he joined a huge protest against the Government's austerity measures.

More than 150,000 people took part in the demonstration in London, which heard calls for a general strike.

Mr Miliband accused the Prime Minister of 'clinging' to policies which were not working. He said the coalition was cutting taxes for millionaires and raising them for everyone else.

He said: 'It is one rule for those at the top and one rule for everyone else.'

The protesters carried banners which 
read: 'Cameron Has Butchered Britain', '24 Hour General Strike Now' and 
'No Cuts' as they marched through Whitehall towards Hyde Park.

Others waved banners saying: 'Plebs of the World Unite', in reference to the scandal which led to MP Andrew Mitchell's resignation yesterday.

They booed at Downing Street and shouted 'pay your taxes' as they passed a Starbucks coffee shop.

Police officers stood outside Starbucks, which has been involved in a row over its tax arrangements.

Some of the marchers shouted 'no first class tickets here' in reference to the incident involving the Chancellor.

Mr Miliband was booed by a small section of a rally in Hyde Park when he said Labour would have to make 'hard choices' if it was in Government.

Nurses, cleaners, librarians and ambulance drivers joined the march across London

The protest is against the government's austerity policies and calls for an alternative economic strategy that puts jobs and growth first

He pledged that if he became Prime Minister he would tax bankers' bonuses, support the building of 100,000 houses and end the privatisation of the NHS.

Bob Crow, leader of the RMT rail union was loudly cheered when he called for a 24-hour general strike. He also called on Mr Miliband to oppose all spending cuts.

Nick Chaffey, 48, a Socialist Party campaigner married to a teacher who has taken a pay cut, said: 'If the working class strike for a day, we'll see who runs this country.'

'I've got friends who are in desperate straits, living in fear of losing their job and their house.'

Nurses, cleaners, librarians and ambulance drivers were among tens of thousands who joined the march and rally in Hyde Park, in one of the biggest anti-austerity protests this year.

Trade union leaders are trying to use
the rally to pile more pressure on Cameron, telling protesters the 
government's economic plan has failed and only prolonged Britain's 
recession.

While the rally was taking place, anti-capitalist protestors clashed with police at Oxford Circus.

Officers made two arrests for assault on police during the confrontation.

A Metropolitan Police spokesman said:
‘Two arrests were made for assault on police in Oxford Circus, as 
police responded to a number of incidents of anti-social behaviour by 
various groups who targeted well-known high street stores.

‘The two are currently in custody.’

The TUC said the turnout was better than expected and sent a strong message to the Government about the unpopularity of its policies.

General secretary Brendan Barber said: 'We are sending a very strong message that austerity is simply failing.

'The Government is making life desperately hard for millions of people because of pay cuts for workers, while the rich are given tax cuts.'

While the rally was taking place, elsewhere campaigners caused mayhem

Meanwhile, a mass rally in Belfast was told anti-austerity campaigners across the UK must unite to reject the economic policies of the coalition.

Thousands of public sector workers and supporters took part in the march, which was organised by the Northern Ireland Committee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions (ICTU) to coincide with  demonstrations in London and Glasgow.

Peter Bunting, the assistant general secretary of ICTUni, said the devolved administrations must work together with opponents of the Government in England to send a clear message against the measures being introduced in Westminster.

With regard to Northern Ireland, Mr Bunting told workers they had too often been divided into sectarian blocs. 'We cannot allow that to happen ever again,' he said.

'We shall resist such cynical, sectarian manipulation and we shall unite to resist the unworkable and cruel cult of austerity.'
