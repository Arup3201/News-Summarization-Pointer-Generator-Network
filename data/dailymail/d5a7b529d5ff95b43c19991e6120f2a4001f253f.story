Good Samaritan: But this photograph of Leslie Austin was put on a police poster accusing him of being a suspect in the London riots

A Good Samaritan who went out of his way to help the vulnerable during the London riots has won a pay-out from police after officers published posters accusing him of being involved with the violence.

Leslie Austin, who volunteers for numerous charities in Hackney, was thanked by multiple officers for protecting bystanders on the night of August 8 2011.

But a few months later he was shocked to see his face plastered all over adverts which described him as a possible suspect.

The Metropolitan Police has now agreed to pay the 49-year-old substantial damages after a judge at the High Court in London ruled that it had libelled him by continuing to distribute the posters even after he complained.

Mr Austin was 'widely respected' in Hackney, according to his lawyer Matthew Nicklin QC, and on the night that rioting broke out in the area he took to the streets to make sure that no one was in danger.

He escorted a distressed elderly woman away from the unrest, removed debris near a bus so the driver could continue his journey and helped people who were trapped in a building near a burning car.

However, in May 2012 he noticed his photograph on a poster headed 'Operation Withern Identity Sought' which police had distributed to be displayed in local shops.

The advert asked for help from the public in identifying those pictured, including Mr Austin, who were described as having been 'involved in the disorder'.

'This was extremely distressing to the claimant,' Mr Nicklin said. 'Not only was it false in his case, but he felt his safety to be at risk as there had been revenge attacks following the riots.'

Mr Austin contacted his local police station to point out the error, and officers told him that the posters would soon by replaced and his picture removed.

However, his photograph remained on the Hackney Police website until June 15, and a picture of him provided by police was published by the Hackney Gazette on June 7.

Moreover, the posters with his face on remained on display in the borough for a further two months.

Violence: Mr Austin (not pictured) helped police by protecting vulnerable residents of Hackney

Mr Austin repeatedly had to explain to neighbours, shopkeepers and even his employer that he had not in fact been involved with the violence.

The Metropolitan Police initially denied the plaintiff's case, but later admitted that Mr Austin had been seriously libelled by the continuation of the poster campaign.

Officials have apologised and agreed to pay Mr Austin's legal costs as well as damages.

David Hirst, for the police, defended the campaign, saying it helped to bring thousands of rioters to justice.

He also pointed out that after Mr Austin initially came forward, officers told the Hackney Gazette of their mistake and informed the newspaper that he was in fact a public-spirited 'Good Samaritan'.

'The Metropolitan Police are sorry that the steps taken to remove and replace the posters from local shops proved inadequate to correct the position, that Mr Austin's image was not promptly removed from the police website and that they failed to ensure that Mr Austin's image was not published in the Hackney Gazette,' Mr Hirst said.

'It is accepted that these failures have caused damage to the claimant's reputation and have caused him much distress and great concern.'
