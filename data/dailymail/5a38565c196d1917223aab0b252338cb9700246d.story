Women are set to be allowed into frontline combat roles for the first time in British Army history – even though senior officers fear the move will lead to a drop in standards.

Centuries-old rules which prevent women joining infantry and tank unit regiments are likely to be repealed following a six-month review.

Defence Secretary Michael Fallon is expected to sign off the plans this week, bringing Britain into line with allies such as the US and Australia.

As part of the UK review, thousands of officers and members of other ranks across the Army, Royal Navy and RAF were invited to fill in a confidential questionnaire on the website Survey Monkey.

One officer who took part told The Mail on Sunday he had an ‘overwhelming fear’ that Army top brass would lower the physical standards to make the change work. He added: ‘I’m in favour so long as women pass the tests currently in place – not new tests designed for both men and women which are easier than what we demand now.

‘I’ve seen what several years serving in the infantry does to very fit and determined men, who are built bigger and stronger than women. They carry huge packs and endure enormous hardships.

‘What will lifting 100lbs over the mountains do to a woman’s body which simply isn’t designed for it? We will break people into pieces if we go through with this.’

Other officers said they were worried that the Army could be leaving itself open to expensive legal action should women who volunteer for infantry training suffer serious injuries.

They also pointed out that, on the basis of their own experiences, few women are interested in transferring into combat units.

An exemption clause in the European Union’s Equal Treatment Directive allows the UK to exclude women from certain military units in order to guarantee public safety. A similar clause was written into the UK Equality Act of 2010.

However, Britain is also obliged by the European Commission to periodically reassess discriminatory legislation. And supporters of women being permitted to join the infantry say their performance in Afghanistan has proved the time is right for change.

On a visit to Helmand Province in February 2013, The Mail on Sunday asked female soldiers if they wanted to join the infantry.

Private Alex Neil from 12 Close Support Logistic Regiment said: ‘If a woman is good enough, why not? Our infantry should definitely be opened up to female recruits. We carry the same amount of kit as the guys and do many of the same jobs.’

But Pte Alisha Henderson, serving in a catering unit, disagreed. She said: ‘Some women say you should push for equality but I think it is impossible for most women to be as strong as men.’

Three British female personnel lost their lives in clashes with the Taliban: Captain Lisa Head, 29, and Corporals Sarah Bryant, 26, and Channing Day, 25.

A Ministry of Defence spokesman confirmed the review process into women in combat roles was continuing.
