Millions of people given extortionate car parking charges outside train stations, NHS hospitals and supermarkets could be in line for a refund thanks to a new campaign.

Cambridge law graduate Michael Green, 22, is leading a legal battle to have the 'fines' overturned in what could be Britain's largest ever group litigation.

Private companies which run car parks outside some of Britain's biggest store chains - including Aldi, Lidl, B&Q and PC World - will often allow customers to park for free, but threaten a large fine for  exceeding a certain time limit.

However, Mr Green believes that these fines are unlawful - and is trying to gather 100,000 cases together to go to the High Court and prove it.

Clamping down: A new campaign is challenging extortionate penalty charge notices handed out by private companies outside hospitals, shops and train stations - and could get tens of millions of people a refund

If he wins the landmark legal case, then that could open the door for 'at least 10million people' to claim their money back, and could put a stop to the fines for good. 

He said: 'These "fines" are not official fines, but instead a matter of private law between two parties.

'When you park in a car park you are entering into a contract with the company which provides that parking space.

'If you breach a contract then under contract law that company is only allowed to make a claim for the amount they have actually lost.

'Because these spaces are free to park in, I would argue the amount is actually nothing.

'People take cases like this to the county court fairly regularly, and judges will often rule that the fines are unenforceable and the charge will be overturned.

'However, because of the way the county court system works, this will only settle the claim between one person and one company. 

'By gathering the cases together, and taking it to the High Court, we can set a legal precedent.'

When a judge made a similar ruling over PPI, it opened the door to a flood of claims that has seen banks set aside tens of billions of pounds in repayments.

In the case of PPI, the ruling applied to 90 per cent of policies sold. Mr Green believes a new ruling could apply to 98 per cent of parking fines handed out by private companies.

Raking it in: Money collected from parking charge notices has almost doubled in the last four years alone

Growing problem: Each time a private company issues a fine, they request the driver's details from the DVLA. This data shows that, in 2014 alone, nearly 2.7million fines will be issued

An estimated 2.2million such fines were handed out last year alone, and that number is set to rise to 2.7million this year.

In total, it is estimated that these companies will collect around £127million in so-called 'fines' this year alone, almost double the £93million collected in 2010, and a 600 per cent increase on 2006, when just £21million was charged to motorists.

Mr Green added: 'In my opinion [the charges] are unlawful. It is remarkable that the parking firms are happy to send out so many "fines", despite their legality not being clear. 

'To make an estimated £176m industry out of this, without having clear legal precedent to do so, is concerning.'

He is currently gathering interest on his Challenge the Fine website, before deciding whether to go ahead with the scheme.

If enough people sign up, he will attempt to gather 100,000 cases together before going to court.

He added: 'I think the law is pretty clear in this area, as evidenced by the conclusions of county court judges.

'But the law on how to organise such big cases is uncertain. We're going to be asking the judge some pretty novel questions so we might get some pretty novel answers.'

Among the companies using the potentially illegal practices is UKPC, which manages spaces outside NHS hospitals, along high streets, and beside major retailers such as M&S and Tesco.

Other companies include Parking Eye, which controls spaces outside many budget supermarkets including Asda, Lidl and Aldi, and Total Parking Services, which deals largely with shopping parks and stores such as B&Q and PC World. 

The companies will issue ‘parking charge notices’ – named to replicate official council ‘penalty charge notices’ – but which do not have the same legal standing as official fines.

A growing number of people are refusing to pay, and because of this firms often follow the 'fines' with letters threatening court action, in the hope of browbeating people into submission.

Simply ignoring the legal summons is not enough, and will often end up with a person being issued with a CCJ - which could prevent them from taking out loans or getting mortgages in the future. 

Mr Green, from Chatham in Kent, attended  Clare College at Cambridge University, earning a Bachelors degree in 2013, and passing a Law Masters in 2014, receiving some of the top grades in his year.

Rather than begin training as a lawyer, he decided he wanted to start up a company giving everyday people greater access to the courts.

The idea to help fight parking fines came to him after a friend was hit with an excessive charge. In the future, he also hope to help fight rouge telephone callers.

One pensioner was hit with a £70 parking fine at a local NHS hospital after staying just 13 seconds too long.

Marilyn Heald, pictured right, paid 50p to park for 30 minutes while she had an X-ray at the Samuel Johnson Community Hospital in Lichfield last month.

The 64-year-old from Staffordshire was shocked when a fine for £70 from Parking Eye landed on her doorstep a week later. Cameras had recorded her entering the car park – before she even had a chance to park – at 10.14am and 47 seconds.

It logged her leaving at 10.45am, meaning she was penalised just over £5 for each of the 13 extra seconds.

Mrs Heald said: ‘I have no problem in paying to park at the hospital. I’m all for the hospital making money from it. 

'But I don’t understand why they’re using some car park management company, like Parking Eye, who are just there literally to cash in as soon as they can.’

Mrs Heald appealed and the fine was waived. She said: ‘It seems to me that if you appeal they let you off – that’s what’s happened to lots of people I know. 

'They’re not interested in pursuing it at all, they’re just after catching the poor innocent person who is going to pay up.’ 

When Natalie Marshman’s two-year-old son fell seriously ill and began having fits, she rushed him to Ormskirk hospital a couple of miles away.

The 37-year-old parked at the children’s A&E unit and ran inside with her son and eight-month-old daughter. On her return, she was horrified to find she had been given a £60 fine for parking in the drop-off bay.

She said: ‘I was stunned. There was no way I could leave one of my children behind in the car and I had to get my son into the hospital as quickly as possible.’

Her son had an infection of his lymph nodes and needed treatment for the next three weeks.

Mrs Marshman, pictured left, said: ‘I was shocked they would ticket someone who was clearly in an emergency, but they just said: “You should have got an ambulance”.’

The mother of three refused to pay the fine on ‘moral grounds’, but it was increased to £100 and she received threatening letters from UKPC warning her of legal action.

She said: ‘It was causing me and my partner immense stress, so in the end we had to pay.’

Mrs Marshman added that she was relieved the aggressive practices at Ormskirk hospital had been reined in by the management.

‘It was a disgrace,’ she said. ‘Many of these people are very sick and yet they are being targeted by a firm looking to make a profit.’ 

An 80-year-old diabetic was targeted by McDonald’s private parking wardens after suffering a medical emergency while parked at its outlet at Gatwick airport.

Charlie Webley, right with his daughter Sharon, needed to wait at the restaurant longer than planned to ensure his blood sugar had stabilised before he could to drive on safely.

Two days later a parking penalty notice arrived from MET Parking.

It had captured the details of the car using automatic number plate recognition cameras and the official DVLA database.

After the firm was told about his condition it doubled the charge from £50 to £100 because it was not paid within 14 days.

Mr Webley, from Strood in Kent, had travelled to the airport last summer to pick up his daughter Sharon, who owns the car.

Miss Webley, 54, said: ‘Effectively, we were sent a £100 penalty for over-staying by just 16 minutes.’

The civil servant launched a successful appeal to the independent tribunal service POPLA and the penalty was cancelled.
