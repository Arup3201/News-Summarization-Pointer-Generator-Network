Irish snack company Tayto has scored an unlikely hit with its cheese and onion flavoured chocolate bar.

The firm has already sold out of the limited edition run of 100,000 bars it produced in Ireland following requests on social networking sites.

And thousands of Irish Australians have also been trying to get hold of 24 of the bars that have made it Down Under.

The bars feature pieces of Tayto cheese and onion crisps covered in chocolate. They have already sold out in Ireland, according to Metro.

And while the response to the oddly-flavoured chocolate bar has certainly been mixed, the demand for the 24 shipped to Australia remains high, according to the Herald Sun.

Taste Ireland chief executive Eamon Eastwood, who imports Irish treats for homesick travellers, decided to raffle the 24 bars off in a Facebook campaign.

He told the paper: 'I couldn't believe the reaction, it went off the richter scale with almost half a million impressions.

'It's an unusual taste - crunchy chocolate and then a lingering taste of cheese of onion.'

The jury is still out however on the success of the new combination.

The chocolate bars have so far received a mixed reaction

The bars have been described as 'unusual' with a 'lingering taste of cheese of onion'

Others on the site however were less impressed.
