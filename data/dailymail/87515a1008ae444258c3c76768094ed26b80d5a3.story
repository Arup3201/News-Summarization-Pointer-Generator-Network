A fight in the crowded Westfield shopping centre just before the Olympics led to murder and a pitched battle between two gangs, a court heard.

Shoppers looked on in horror as Liam Woodards, 24, was stabbed in the chest after glasses and a yoghurt pot were thrown at rivals.

As he lay dying, youths began fighting, throwing metal chairs and brandishing two knives, the Old Bailey was told.

Victim: Liam Woodards was stabbed at Westfield shopping centre just before the Olympics

'It was a joint pitched battle,' said Aftab Jafferjee QC, prosecuting.

Nii-Azu Kojo Smith, 18, of Hackney Wick, east London, denies murder at the prestigious site next to the Olympic Park in Stratford, east London, on June 29.

Seven others aged between 18 and 25 deny violent disorder, while five others have pleaded guilty to various offences, the jury was told.

Mr Jafferjee said it was not known if there had been a history between the two groups or whether the confrontation was 'gratuitous and opportunistic violence'.

But there had been 'an atmosphere of menace' with 'verbal posturing' between the two sides during the build up.

At 4.20pm, the groups converged and after a number of exchanges, they moved towards some central stalls with Mr Woodards ending up amongst the rival youths.

Mr Jafferjee said there was little doubt that Mr Woodards had been 'confrontational and mouthy' in the escalating atmosphere.

A glass and a yoghurt pot had been thrown by Mr Woodards' group, then a third item, a glass or yoghurt pot landed on or near Kojo-Smith.

Mr Jafferjee said: 'The deceased did not throw anything. His only crime was to have been mouthy.'His misfortune was to be closest to Kojo-Smith who was confronting the other man just before the item landed.'

Kojo-Smith allegedly produced a knife as Mr Woodards moved away.

'In an utterly disproportionate and lethal reaction, Kojo-Smith lunged forward and stabbed the retreating Liam Woodards in the chest.

'This was as needless as it was cowardly. Mr Woodards was an easy and mouthy target.'

A thrown yoghurt pot sparked a knife murder in front of horrified shoppers inside the giant mall next to the London Olympic site just weeks before the games began.

Two rival gangs squared up to each other as they met in 'The Street' area of the Westfield Shopping Centre in Stratford, east London, last June, a court heard today.

Plastic bottles and plastic yoghurt pots were thrown and when one hit alleged killer Nii-Azu Kojo-Smith, 18, he responded by pulling out a knife and lunging at Liam Woodard 'whose only crime thus far was to have been mouthy,' the Old Bailey was told.

Mr Woodard, who turned 24 the day before his death and had been celebrating his birthday with pals, had the 'misfortune' to have been close to Kojo-Smith when he lunged forward and stabbed him once in the chest.

As Kojo-Smith fled, Mr Woodard's friends picked up steel chairs and began hurling them at the rival gang in front of shoppers as two other knives were brandished.

Aftab Jafferjee QC, prosecuting, told the Old Bailey jury the yoghurt pot had been thrown by Danny Caton, 24, who has since pleaded guilty to violent disorder.

He said Caton's act 'set in motion the train of events'.

Mr Jafferjee said: 'He threw a glass and then a plastic yoghurt pot at or towards the rival group. A third pot or glass was also thrown. It may not readily be apparent who it was.

'As far as the offensive behaviour and verbal posturing in immediate build up for the violence that was to follow, there is little to choose between the conduct of various members of each group , each being as offensive as the other.

'Woodard had plainly not thrown anything, his only crime thus far was to have been mouthy. His misfortune was to be close to Kojo-Smith, each confronting each other either before or after the items were thrown.'

He said CCTV captured Kojo-Smith pulling out the knife murder and recorded the murder and the resulting violence.

He added: 'Significantly Woodard, the deceased, was beginning to back away. He was therefore not only unarmed but posing no threat whatsoever to Kojo-Smith.

'In an utterly disproportionate and lethal reaction, Kojo-Smith lunged forward and stabbed the retreating Woodard in his chest.

'Kojo-Smith seeks to rely on self-defence. The prosecution case is that the evidence demonstrates that nothing could be further from the truth.

'This was an act by Kojo-Smith that was as needless as it was cowardly. Kojo-Smith had a knife and he could see Woodard did not. Woodard was an easy and mouthy target, it was as simple and mindless as that.'

Mr Jafferjee said as Kojo-Smith fled Woodard's friends been hurling chairs and in the mayhem that followed it was not apparent Woodard had been stabbed.

He said: 'A frightening event for members of the public who were obviously around at the time simply trying to shop and enjoy themselves in such avenue shortly before the London Olympics was to begin, this being June 29.'

Kojo-Smith, of Hackney, denies murder.

Michael Alvaranga, 24, Javin Rigabie, 23, Travis Townsend, 21, and members of Woodard's gang Tony Caton, 21, Anselm Legemah, 18, Jason Vaughan, 25, and Emmanuel Oloyede, 19, all deny violent disorder.

The trial continues.
