All is well in my world. The sun is shining, I’m about to go on holiday, the 5:2 diet has worked and I’ve lost a stone.

Why, I’m positively Pollyanna-like as I breeze down the road to meet a friend for lunch, humming a happy tune as I go.

And then it happens. 'Turn that frown upside down!' trills a complete stranger as he passes. 'It might never happen, love!'

Sunny: According to those in the know, Victoria Beckham is utterly lovely but her BRF disguises it

What he simply doesn’t realise is that I have a tragic and little-understood affliction: what internet wags have dubbed 'Bitchy Resting Face' (BRF). This makes people like me look moody, bored or, yes, even mean, when they’re in repose or being thoughtful.

It can affect anyone — even celebrities. In fact, it’s the only  thing Victoria Beckham and I  have in common.

Her often pouty expression belies the fact that underneath she has a cracking sense of humour and the sunniest of dispositions. Well, me too. I like to think I’m a glass half-full kind of gal, and I do frequently smile.

It’s just that when my face is merely 'resting', I tend to look like I’m about to commit murder. I’m always being asked if I’ve got out of bed on the wrong side while even unposed photographs of me — having what I thought was a nice time — suggest I could make hell freeze over with my icy glare.

Sufferer: A new spoof PSA addresses the problems experienced by women afflicted by 'Bitchy Resting Face'

'Incurable': This woman may be happy to smell the flowers on a spring day, but her face doesn't show it 

Luckily for me and fellow sufferers, a parody video, which has become a hit on YouTube, sets out to explain Bitchy Resting Face is an incurable syndrome requiring compassion and understanding. Hopefully, it will  change ill-formed perceptions. 

'These women might be suffering without you even knowing it,' the video explains patiently. 'They might not be mean at all ... '   

And, anyway, as it also points out, there’s something even worse: the male equivalent. This makes many men look deeply grumpy and bad-tempered, when they’re really as chirpy as Jiminy Cricket. 

In fact, as I sit opposite my husband, I remind myself that his frowning, about-to-explode expression has nothing to do with the news that I’ve pranged his car. It’s just his face — and he can’t help it.
