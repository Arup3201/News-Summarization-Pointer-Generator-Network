Joe Biden shouldn't expect to be recognized by many people during his trip to Los Angeles this week - apart from those who love his movies.

After the vice president's visit shut down roads in the city on Monday, late night show host Jimmy Kimmel asked 11 people on Hollywood Boulevard who he was - and none guessed correctly.

A few even suggested he was a movie star, while another guessed he was in a terror group.

Only the 12th person was vaguely close, calling Biden 'the assistant president'.

Who is he? A team sent by Jimmy Kimmel (pictured) on Monday asked people on Hollywood Boulevard to identify Vice President Joe Biden - but no one knew who he was

'The Vice President is here so they closed a bunch of streets which, no offense, but do we really need to stop traffic for Joe Biden?' Kimmel asked on Jimmy Kimmel Live! on Monday night.

'I mean, I know he's the vice president but I wonder how many people even care if he's here... We asked Americans a very simple question: Who is Joe Biden?'

One girl gave a wise guess that he might be 'a man', while a couple of people were sure they'd seen him in movies that they couldn't name.

One man, who was wearing a cloth on his head decorated with marijuana leaves, admitted he was under the influence and struggling to recall who Biden was - before suddenly remembering he was 'that old dude' from Pineapple Express - a movie about a weed dealer.

No idea: Some people guessed that he was the governor - or perhaps a movie star or a terror group

Not sure: This man told Kimmel's camera crew that Biden was a Republican set to run for president

Fan: When presented with a picture of Biden, one man says he's 'that old dude' from Pineapple Express

Another passerby guessed 'a terror group' while another assumed he was a Republican, and yet more thought he was the governor - with one suggesting he was a Washington D.C. Congressman.

Biden arrived in Los Angeles on Monday afternoon to attend two Democratic Party fundraisers - one for Iowa Senate candidate Bruce Braley and another for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.

On Tuesday, he is expected to attend a roundtable discussion on minimum wage with Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti.

His trip comes three days before President Obama is scheduled to visit the city to attend a fundraiser hosted by Gwyneth Paltrow. 

Not happy: Biden, pictured in Las Vegas on Monday, was in town to attend Democratic fundraisers
