Larry King is making a comeback with a brand new talk show to air starting next month on the Russia-based RT America network.

The global, English-language channel announced the addition to their line-up Wednesday without giving an exact premier date.

‘Politics with Larry King,’ will be the 79-year-old’s return to the television airwaves after stepping down from his 25-year run as host of CNN’s ‘Larry King Live’ in December 2010.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO...

He's back: Larry King, 79, has a new show set to premier in June on the Russia-based English-language cable channel RT

The new show, according to an RT release, ‘Politics with Larry King is ‘a mold-breaking political talk show…speaking to both leading establishment figures, and those who are not afraid to go against the grain.’

RT also said it will begin telecasting King’s current show, ‘Larry King Now,’ which debuted last summer.

The 56-year television veteran co-founded the company, Ora.TV, which produces his current show with Mexican telecommunications magnate Carlos Slim in 2012. The show airs on Hulu.com and Ora.TV.

With celebrity guests as diverse as conservative radio host Laura Ingraham and Snoop Lion, ‘Larry King Now’ will continue to air online, but will be picked up by RT, where it will air four times per week.

Prolific: King already broadcasts a celebrity-focused show called 'Larry King Now' on ora.TV and Hulu. RT will begin airing it in addition to his new show

Both programs will originate from Washington and Los Angeles. RT America will be the exclusive U.S. television broadcaster for both programs.

As for his audience, King appears to be courting viewers outside the left-right dichotomy.

‘The veteran broadcaster will not shy away from causing controversy,’ reads the release on RT’s website, ‘or using his authority to give a chance to hear voices other media ignore.’

The suspenders-sporting King, who turns 
80 this year, said his frank, opinionated discussions are necessary in 
the new media age.

Powerful friends: King co-founded Ora.TV with Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim in 2012. Now RT will air the show they produced together 4 times per week

‘I have always been passionate about 
government and issues that impact the public,’ said King. ‘I appreciate 
the importance of providing a platform with real alternative visions for
our country's future.’

RT, or Russia Today, was started in 2005 as a worldwide English language news outlet financed by the Russian government.

The
24-hour news network can be viewed by millions in America and is 
carried in the U.S. by cable providers including Time Warner Inc., Cox 
Cable, Comcast Corp. and Verizon FiOS.

More serious: King (here with political activist Christina Tobin) says his new RT show 'Politics with Larry King' will have a more political focus. It is set to premier in June
