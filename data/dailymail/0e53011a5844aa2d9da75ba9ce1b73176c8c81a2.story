The White House's most-watched YouTube video of 2014 wasn't the State of the Union address, Barack Obama's angry denunciation of the ISIS terror army or his ground-shattering declaration of new rights for illegal immigrants.

Those moments pulled in about one-tenth as many viewers as a 3-minute clip showing the president just walking around and meeting tourists in Washington, D.C.

That casual ordinary-guy stunt was viewed more than 5 million times since he took the unannounced stroll on May 21 with White House counselor John Podesta in tow.

'Can't be regular. Can't be routine,' Obama is heard telling him, jacket flung over his shoulder on a warm spring day. 'It's good to be out. The bear is loose!'

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO 

NO AVERAGE STROLL: President Barack Obama walked with White House counselor John Podesta (3rd left) through the Ellipse in Washington on May 21, an event so extraordinary that 5 million people saw it on YouTube

WHAT I DID ON MY SUMMER VACATION: These kids and their parents got the shock of their lives when Obama turned up to say hello 

THE BEAR IS LOOSE: For a few weeks' time in the spring of 2014, the president strayed from his schedule to shake hands and stage stunts like beers and billiards with Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper (right)

Tourists near the White House were shocked.

One told the Associated Press that she though he was a presidential impersonator.

Obama took a handful of unexpected outings in the span of a few weeks, including a Starbucks run and a lunch ad the Shake Shack burger joint.

The president's campaign aides playfully tweaked him in 2008 by muttering 'The bear is loose' whenever he would go off script or take an unscheduled detour to press the flesh.

A Twitter hashtag, fed by West Wing staffers, pushed the message when he downed beers and shot pool with Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper and shook hands with a fan wearing a horse-head mask.

But by mid-2014 White House insiders tried to leverage the phrase to describe an Obama trying to bend another bear – Russian President Vladimir Putin – to his will.

In July as the Russia-Ukraine border threatened to disintegrate in a full-fledged Putin annexation, the media jabs came fast and furious.

Putin was the bear, pundits declared. And Obama was the cub.

The U.S. president's fundraising tour continued while his Russian counterpart's armies menaced to the west and solidified their control over the Crimea.

White House staffers told DailyMail.com at the time that Obama was 'restless' and 'tired of his bubble.'

Six years into his presidency, it seemed, he had some walking around to do. That included a May 16 stop at a Chipotle restaurant and that jaunt to Shake Shake, where he sat on the lunch counter to take a photo with workers.

Americans seem to relish those moments, reminded of the charismatic Illinois senator who campaigned in 2008 on Hope and Change – long before his approval rating nose-dived amid Obamacare website woes and more serious scandals.

On May 21 he handed out White House-branded M&M's to a seven-year-old girl and her four-year-old brother, who told the leader of the free world that he was actually 'four and three-quarters.'

WHY HELLO, WILBUR! Obama cracked jokes on July 8 with a man wearing a horse-head mask as he detoured from his schedule to shake hands in Denver

STARBUCKS, ANYONE? On June 9 the president created his own news cycle by walking across Pennsylvania Avenue in the middle of the day for a caffeine fix

That populist moment captured Americans' imagination far more readily than a 'putting an end to sexual assault' video featuring Daniel Craig, Benicio Del Toro, Dulé Hill, Seth Meyers and Steve Carell.

That PSA came in second with just over 1.5 million views, slightly ahead of first lady Michelle Obama's Mother's Day chat about a mass-kidnapping by the Nigerian terror group Boko Haram.

The 2014 State of the Union address and presidential speeches on Internet 'net neutrality,' immigration and ISIS made the top ten for last year.

But added together, they couldn't compete with the audience for a president, with Secret Service a few strides away, just out for a walk.
