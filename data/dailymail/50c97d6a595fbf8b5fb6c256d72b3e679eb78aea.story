The internal ECB review into the shambolic Ashes surrender will include each player and all support staff giving their comments about this dismal tour.

And their feedback, to be collated by new England managing director Paul Downton, will need to be critical in the extreme about Andy Flower and Alastair Cook for there to be any changes to that leadership duo.

ECB chairman Giles Clarke and chief executive David Collier have been unequivocal that Flower and Cook will stay on as team  director and captain respectively, despite the 5-0 whitewash that would certainly lead to sackings in other sports.

The players’ response, with the dressing room staying remarkably united in the circumstances, is unlikely to condemn captain or coach and nor will Downton, who needs time to settle into a job he does not start officially until next month.

After such a fiasco, it would be ridiculous for no heads to roll.

So batting coach Graham Gooch and Richard Halsall, Flower’s deputy and fielding coach, are the most likely scapegoats.

The hallowed home dressing room at the Sydney Cricket Ground was opened up to Manchester United when they held a training session there on a pre-season tour.

Unimpressed with the setting was 
United boss David Moyes, who shares his predecessor’s belief that if 
Brazil don’t play it, it doesn’t count as a sport.

Coincidentally,
 England captain Alastair Cook revealed after the 5-0 whitewash that he 
is halfway through Sir Alex Ferguson’s book, which is giving him the 
inspiration to carry on.

Poor Monty Panesar might have failed to 
lure American backpacker Alison to his hotel room in Melbourne via 
social media after the fourth-Test defeat.

But it is understood a couple of the 
divorced spinner’s single England team-mates have had a lot more success
 on tour using the same matchmaking phone app Tinder that facilitates 
meeting viable partners in the user’s surrounding area.

This England tour seems to have gone pear-shaped since some of the squad got upset that their last few days at home before 10 weeks Down Under would be taken up by a team-bonding exercise — still, bizarrely, the subject of the utmost secrecy.

It was organised by former SAS soldier Floyd Woodrow, who is CEO of Chrysalis Worldwide, described as one of the leading values-based performance optimisation organisations.

The only public mention of the Staffordshire-based trip is Woodrow’s tweet: ‘Outstanding three days with one of my favourite teams.

'They picked up complicated training quickly and executed the drills to perfection.’

If one word sums up England’s displays since, it ain’t perfection.

‘Assassins’ fire blanks

The Test team dressing-room doors display — as part of security regulations — the mugshots of all those allowed access.

There were 34 on the England door compared to Australia’s 31, including an excessive number of support personnel who only helped muddle minds judging by the performances.

Struggling: England's Jonathan Trott was forced to quit this winter's Ashes series with a stress-related illness

The work done by sports psychologist Mark Bawden has to be questioned with so many England players failing to cope with the stresses of an Ashes tour. Bawden, who gave up cricket after suffering the yips, uses profiling tools to characterise people.

He said pre-tour: ‘Alastair Cook is a really good example of an assassin (a thinker), someone who’s able repeatedly to stay within his bubble and do his own thing. Jonathan Trott and Chris Tremlett are also assassins.’

How wrong could he be?

Former England spinner John Emburey, in Australia working as a pundit for Fairfax Radio, is the leading candidate to become a Test selector.

It would be a good move because Emburey is very much his own man. Other contenders include Geoff Cook, Marcus Trescothick, Angus Fraser and Jack Russell.

Shane Warne, Sky TV’s overrated pundit who repeats the same lines again and again, seems to save his fresh opinions for insulting Sports Agenda. I am now a ‘f***wit’, according to the Aussie former leg-spinner.
