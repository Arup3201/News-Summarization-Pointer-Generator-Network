A judge ordered disgraced Houston hand surgeon Michael Glyn Brown to be arrested for contempt of court for the second time after once again skipping a hearing related to his divorce from Rachel Brown.

The soon-to-be ex, meanwhile, was in attendance and even briefly posed for pictures, though she left before the hearing—smiling for the camera alongside her new love, retired Houston Astros great Jeff Bagwell.

Brown’s prior contempt-of-court arrest was back in March, when the same judge who handed down Tuesday’s order, Judge Sheri Y. Dean. The owner of a national chain of hand surgery clinics was jailed less than three weeks.

Moving on? Rachel Brown is in a bitter divorce battle with disgraced hand surgeon Michael Brown and showed up to the most recent hearinng alongside her new beau, former Astros star Jeff Bagwell

Brown, who lost his medical license in 2006 after he tested positive for cocaine, has been a fixture in Texas courts for years, now.

In January, Brown was accused of choking a flight attendant and threatening to strip naked on a flight from London to Miami.

The flight attendant told authorities that she was able to pull away from Brown's grasp but alleged that his behavior continued after she returned to serve him a some food.

A criminal complaint obtained by the Houston Chronicle earlier this year said that Brown knocked over the meal as he wrapped his hands around her neck and began to squeeze, and asked her 'are you a strong woman?'

The Chronicle reported that Brown then said he was going to 'get naked' and remarked about the 'sexual' things he wanted to do to the women.

Eventually, the flight crew was able to get Brown calm, and he soon fell asleep for the remainder of the flight. When the plane landed, he was taken into custody and has since pleaded guilty to related charges.

He is currently in a divorce battle with Rachel Brown, his fourth wife.

In 2011, Brown went to trial on charges he threw a humanitarian award and two heavy vases at Rachel Brown. He was later acquitted.

It was not the first time Rachel Brown accused her husband of assault. According to the Houston Press, Rachel made prior complaints against Brown at least three times: in 2003, 2006, and 2009.

She filed for divorce on Jan. 7, 2011.

Jeff Bagwell, whose impressive career saw him hit 449 home runs, came into the mix in the last year and, according to the New York Post, isn’t a squeaky clean replacement for Brown.

In a January 2013 hearing concerning 
Brown’s visitation of their children, Rachel admitted that Bagwell had 
recently entered a rehab facility for alcohol abuse and left before 
completing the program. Bagwell has always maintained that he’s never 
used performance enhancing drugs.

Rachel herself admitted in court to using cocaine and ecstasy after the birth of her kids. She says she stopped using drugs in 2009.

Rachel has said she intends to marry Bagwell.

Tuesday’s proceedings set a September 30 trial date for the divorce trial.

Brown now stands to be arrested for contempt of court. Though he previously served less than a month for the same charge, Brown was sentenced 180 days in jail for the first offense.

Brown’s sentencing for the flight attendant assault is set for September 25.
