Liverpool are close to agreeing a revised four-and-a-half year contract with midfielder Philippe Coutinho.

The 22-year-old Brazilian's current deal runs to 2018 but talks have been ongoing and are drawing to a conclusion. 

Coutinho signed from Inter Milan for £8.5m in 2013 and manager Brendan Rodgers has been determined to build a side around his mercurial midfielder.

Liverpool are keen to tie Brazilian playmaker Philippe Coutinho down to a new long-term contract

Rodgers heaped praise upon the boy from Rio de Janeiro for his performance against Chelsea in Tuesday night's Capital One Cup semi-final draw.

'He was outstanding the other night,' the Liverpool boss said. 'It was a difficult start to the season for him because if you think of Phil Coutinho, he has that bit of magic to make the key pass in the final third and combines with people ahead of him so well.

'Last year he had a [Luis] Suarez and a [Daniel] Sturridge to make those passes to and he could work well with their style.

'At the beginning of this season, he didn't have that. Probably until six or seven weeks ago, his ability to make that threaded pass through wasn't on because he didn't have that [energy and movement upfront].'

The change in system for Liverpool has returned Coutinho to his role behind the striker and Rodgers added: 'We had to look at how to bring out the best in all our players, and once he's had mobility, energy and speed around him, it's lifted his game. 

'He's a class act, and he's still got so much growth and development to undertake here.'
