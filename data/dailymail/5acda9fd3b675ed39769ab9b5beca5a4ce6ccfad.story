Self-confessed ‘party boy’ Solomon Akhtar, 22, from London allegedly filmed himself with an ex-girlfriend

The Apprentice has become embroiled in fresh controversy after it emerged one of the contestants allegedly made a sex tape which show bosses fear could be leaked to the public.

Self-confessed ‘party boy’ Solomon Akhtar allegedly filmed himself with an ex-girlfriend and was forced to confess to BBC bosses after his friends posted the information on Twitter.

It is the latest in a string of controversies for this year’s show, which is fronted by Sir Alan Sugar, after it was revealed that fellow contestant James Hill, 27, is a convicted thug who bit a man’s ear.

BBC bosses are said to be ‘concerned’ Mr Akhtar’s sex tape will leak while the tenth series of the show is on air.

News of the video first surfaced after a friend of the technology entrepreneur from London posted news of it on Twitter with the caption: ‘revelation of the day’. It was later deleted.

Friends of the 22-year-old have reportedly told The Sun the sordid tape is one of many, prompting fears other former girlfriends may come out of the woodwork and sell their stories.

According to the newspaper, a show insider said: 'This is a concern for Solomon and the BBC.

'Both are hoping his conquests keep quiet.

'He is still on good terms with his ex, so while she has obviously told friends about the tape, fingers are crossed that she won't leak it.

'But there are no guarantees that she, or any other former flames, won't come out of the woodwork and reveal what he's been up to.'

Mr Akhtar, who has confessed on the show to enjoying a party lifestyle, runs his own social media technology business and works at a creative agency.

In his profile for the show, he described himself as ‘enthusiastic, energetic, personable and passionate about technology and travel.’

'I am from the “ideas generation”; because of my age, I understand technology and how to turn it into a business,' he said.

He has also claimed his biggest life regret is 'spending too much time and hard-earned money at university on partying.'

The revelation is the latest controversy to hit the BBC1 show.

Details of Mr Hill’s conviction left show bosses red-faced after it was revealed that he beat up a bus driver who was talking to his girlfriend and hit him with 'punch after punch' in the unprovoked attack. The victim was left scarred for life.

While Mr Hill, who started out in business washing cars and now runs several businesses including selling vending machines and running his own bar and restaurant, waited for the court case into the incident, he attacked again.

Just months after the first attack, he was arrested for biting a man's ear on Christmas Eve 2008.

He appeared at Chesterfield Magistrates' Court in March 2009, where he was charged under his full name of Anthony James Hill and admitted two counts of assault.

In July that year he was sentenced to six months in prison, suspended, ordered to pay his victims £300 and £200 respectively, and told to pay £755 costs.

Mr Hill, from Chesterfield (pictured on the BBC show), was convicted in 2009 of two attacks in which he bit a man's ear and left the other scarred for life. He has since said he 'very much' regrets the unprovoked incidents

After details of his conviction emerged, the contestant came out and said he was ‘not proud’ of the attacks and ‘very much’ regrets them.

However, it didn’t stop him allegedly sparking up a relationship with fellow contestant Lauren Riley, 28, during filming for the show.

They allegedly had a 'full-on fling' while competing for the £250,000 top prize.

Representatives for The Apprentice declined to comment when contacted by MailOnline.
