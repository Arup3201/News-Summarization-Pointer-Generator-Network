A rugby player has described the 'tackle of his life' as he took down a thief who stole his wife's purse from the back of his car.

Richard Kenyon, 33, was dressed in just his pyjamas when he chased after the thief while on holiday at the Low Briery Holiday Village in Keswick, Cumbria.

Describing how he chased after the man for about half a mile, the semi-professional player for Fylde and Lancashire rugby club said: 'It was the tackle of my life, perfect technique, perfect timing. And his unlucky day.'

Hero: Richard Kenyon managed to catch the thief prowling through his Range Rover at a caravan park by sprinting after him for half a mile without any shoes on

Scene of the crime: The Low Briery Holiday Village in Cumbria where the Kenyon family were on holiday for the weekend

His wife Johanna Kenyon woke up at 6.30am on Sunday to feed their eight-month-old son, Charlie, when she spotted the man rummaging through the family Range Rover.

She woke her husband and he leaped from the bed before running uphill, along a disused railway track, along a footpath, by the side of a river, over a fence and into a forest while barefoot.

Mission accomplished: Mr Kenyon managed to frogmarch the thief back to the caravan site, where police arrested him

Mr Kenyon, joint managing director at Dewlay Cheesemakers of Garstang in Preston, said: 'The guy had a 120-metre start on me but my instincts were to protect my family and belongings.

'The adrenaline kicked in and I wasn't going to stand by and let this happen.'

'He turned on to a dirt track in a vain attempt to get away but I closed him down, he turned around and I could see the fear in his eyes.

'This was only going to end one way and he knew it. I think he realised I was a bit bigger than him.'

'I executed a textbook rugby tackle and brought him to the ground. It was the best tackle I have ever made.

'I escorted him back to the caravan and the police arrived and arrested him.'

Richard, who has played rugby for 14 years, said his wife's purse, which the man had tossed into the river, was recovered.

The 14 stone fly-half is now the toast of Fylde Rugby Club where his teammates have nicknamed him 'superhero'.

A spokesman for Cumbria Police said a 40-year-old man from the Tyne and Wear area had been charged with two offences of theft in connection with the incident and is due to appear at Newcastle Magistrates Court on May 30.
