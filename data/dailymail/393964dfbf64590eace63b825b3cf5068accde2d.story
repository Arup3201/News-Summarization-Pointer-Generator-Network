The 39-year-old's body was later found at her rented cottage 14 miles away in the Suffolk village of Long Melford.

Detective Inspector Eamonn Bridger told  Kevin McCarthy, eastern coroner for Suffolk,  that Zambian-born Deborah had suffered 'wounds to her head and neck'.

Forensic tests found her blood on the axe and her husband's DNA on the handle. Her blood was also found on his clothes.

DI Bridger told the hearing in Ipswich, Suffolk the pair had separated in 2013 but remained on good terms for the sake of their four daughters, aged eight, 11, 12 and 16.

He said Deborah had suffered from 'alcohol problems' and had returned to the village after 'several months' away.

He added that Mr Ruse had been suffering from mental health issues shortly before the double deaths on November 13.

He said he had 'thoughts of suicide' and stayed overnight at a local mental health unit based at West Suffolk Hospital in Bury St Edmunds - on November 5.

The family butcher then had 'ongoing contact with the Crisis at Home team' and on November 11 revealed to family he had thought about killing his wife.

DI Bridge added: 'He made comments to his sister. He said the only way out was if he killed Deborah but he said he couldn't live with this.'

Two days later after spending the morning working as normal at his butcher's shop in Long Melford, he launched the attack, the inquest was told.

CCTV footage showed him driving away from his business around 11.36am. Other footage showed showed his wife going to a local shop to buy two bottles of wine and some cigarettes.

Mr Ruse was then filmed driving into a car park in Bury St Edmunds in his gold Land Rover just before midday.

DI Bridge said: 'Paramedics were called to treat him for his injuries but he died at the scene.

'A gold Land Rover discovery vehicle was found. That vehicle was registered to Ruse and Sons Butchers.

Two days later he carried out his horrific threat after spending the morning working as normal at his butcher's shop in Long Melford, the inquest was told

'Within the vehicle they found a black bag containing a hand axe covered in blood. That raised concerns over other family members.'  

'At 2.35pm they found the dead body of Deborah in the kitchen at [her address]'

A post mortem by Dr Nat Carey on November 15 found Mr Ruse died of severe internal and external injuries, including wounds to her head and neck. Police are still awaiting the full results of her post mortem.

The inquest heard how Mr Ruse was raised in Suffolk and met Deborah while she was studying at the University of Buckingham.

They married in 1998 and had four daughters before moving to Long Melford, Suffolk.

DI Bridger said the pair 'separated as a result of their differences' in 2013.

He said: 'Deborah was suffering from alcohol problems and the relationship remained acrimonious up until her death.'

DI Bridger added that 'there was an ongoing dispute as to where the children were living up until their deaths'.

Mr McCarthy said: 'On the basis of that evidence I formally open the inquest of Oliver Ruse and also the inquest is opened into Deborah Ruse's death.'

Speaking to DI Bridger, he added: 'Please carry to the respective families my heartfelt condolences.

'Tragedies like this bring home to us all the complexities of relationships and the frailties of life.'

The inquest was adjourned until February 26.
