The FA have upset England‘s hardcore travelling support before the World Cup kick-off by reversing the importance of home and away attendance at games.

A revamped England supporters’ club now receive two caps for going to a Wembley game with one awarded for watching the side abroad, when it used to be the other way around.

The number of supporter caps determines your place in the queue for tickets for Euro 2016 in France when there is likely to be unprecedented demand due to the proximity of the host country and ease of travel.

Upset: The FA have upset England fans by reversing the importance of home and away games

But those fans cheering England in Miami this week before moving on to Brazil are angry that their loyal - and expensive - support away from home will be downgraded.

The FA do not hide the fact that filling Wembley is their priority, especially during the next two years of an unappetising qualifying tournament.

Research also showed that a  significant proportion of the away fan base do not go to home matches. An FA spokesman said: ‘Any football club would have the same approach.’

Hurt: The FA have their work cut out if they want David Beckham back on side after his London Olympics snub

FA insiders believe they still have a job to do to bring David Beckham back on side following the brutal way manager Stuart Pearce rejected him for the GB team at the London Olympics.

Beckham was widely considered a certainty for the squad having been named on the long list by Pearce.

However, the Beckham camp have no issues with the current FA regime as was shown by the former England captain making a brief visit to the team hotel after arriving in Miami last Friday to wish the party luck in Brazil.

Friends: The atmosphere inside the England camp seems to be particularity upbeat

Every England side approaching a major tournament are said to have the best team spirit ever but evidence suggests Roy Hodgson’s Brazil squad have bonded particularly well.

Shirts put out for players to sign for the departing John Stones and Jon Flanagan were autographed by all the remaining 23 bound for Rio.

And whereas England teams in the past were full of club cliques, players have been  joining the table of whoever is in the dining  room at the time, rather than just sitting with club-mates.

Experience: Beckham's journey into the Amazon will be shown on Monday night

The Beckham Amazon jungle documentary to be shown on BBC on Monday features many extraordinary sights. None stranger than members of the Yanomami tribe who tie their stretched foreskins to a waist string. Beckham said: ‘They did. It’s part of the culture.’

Becks sticks to Plan M

David Beckham is still hopeful he will find the right downtown waterside site for his Miami football stadium despite the unexpected level of opposition to his venue plans - and of the effort required to see the project through.

He said:  ‘We have come up against a few businesses that are opposed but we will find the right site. It’s a lot of work on the politics side which I’m not used to doing and it’s harder than expected.

'There were always going to be difficulties with the sites but I’m confident we will put the  stadium in a place Miami people deserve.’

Beckham, who continues to talk to basketball superstar LeBron James about joining his ownership group, will target big names in football.

‘That’s the attraction of Miami,’ he said. ‘Numerous players, including former team-mates, have contacted me and we’d love great players coming here.’

ITV ride out the storm

The World Cup curse of ITV continues. The later kick-off for the Honduras match - due to the Britain’s Got Talent final - meant the match was interrupted for 45 minutes during the first half because of an electrical storm.

However, it still attracted a healthy peak  audience of 7.5million.
