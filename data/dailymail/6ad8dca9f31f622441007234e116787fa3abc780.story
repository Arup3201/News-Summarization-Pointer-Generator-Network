A bizarre worm-like animal that lived 505 million years ago has been definitively categorised on the ‘Tree of Life’ by scientists.

Known as Hallucigenia the creature has legs, spikes, a head and a tail, and has been linked with a group of modern animals for the first time.

It had once been considered an ‘evolutionary misfit’ but now researchers have found an important link with modern velvet worms, which live in tropical forests.

A bizarre creature that existed 505 million years ago has been classified by scientists. Known as Hallucigenia sparsa (artist's impression shown),  the worm-like creature with legs, spikes and a head difficult to distinguish from its tail has found its place in the evolutionary 'Tree of Life'

The discovery published in the journal Nature was made by scientists at the University of Cambridge.

The Cambrian explosion, or Cambrian radiation, was the relatively rapid appearance, around 530 million years ago, of most major animal phyla, as demonstrated in the fossil record.

Before about 580 million years ago, most organisms were simple, composed of individual cells occasionally organized into colonies.

Over the following 70 or 80 million years, the rate of evolution accelerated by an order of magnitude (as defined in terms of the extinction and origination rate of species) and the diversity of life began to resemble that of today.

It ended with the Cambrian-Ordovician extinction event, approximately 488 million years ago.

The similarity of Hallucigenia to other contemporary 'legged worms', collectively known as lobopodians, has been very controversial.

This is because a lack of clear characteristics linking them to each other or to modern animals has made it difficult to determine their evolutionary home.

What is more, early interpretations of Hallucigenia, which was first identified in the 1970s, placed it both backwards and upside-down. 

The spines along the creature's back were originally thought to be legs, its legs were thought to be tentacles along its back, and its head was mistaken for its tail.

Hallucigenia lived approximately 505 million years ago during the Cambrian Explosion, a period of rapid evolution when most major animal groups first appear in the fossil record. 

These particular fossils come from the Burgess Shale in Canada's Rocky Mountains, one of the richest Cambrian fossil deposits in the world.

Looking like something from science fiction, Hallucigenia (illustration shown) had a row of rigid spines along its back, and seven or eight pairs of legs ending in claws. The animals were between 0.2 and 1.4 inches (five and 35 millimetres) in length, and lived on the floor of the Cambrian oceans

Which way is the right way? Initially scientists had thought that the creature was supposed to be the other way up, with the spikes acting as the legs and the 'legs' actually being tentacles, but now they think they were looking at it upside down (illustration shown)

A new study of the creature's claws revealed an organisation very close to those of modern velvet worms, where layers of cuticle (a hard substance similar to fingernails) are stacked one inside the other, like Russian nesting dolls. 

The same nesting structure can also be seen in the jaws of velvet worms, which are no more than legs modified for chewing.

'It's often thought that modern animal groups arose fully formed during the Cambrian Explosion,' said Dr Martin Smith of the University's Department of Earth Sciences, the paper's lead author. 

'But evolution is a gradual process: today's complex anatomies emerged step by step, one feature at a time. 

'By deciphering "in-between" fossils like Hallucigenia, we can determine how different animal groups built up their modern body plans.'

Hallucigenia had once been considered an ‘evolutionary misfit’ but now researchers have found an important link with modern velvet worms, which live in tropical forests. Pictured here is a stock photo of a velvet worm in Dunedin, South Island, New Zealand

While Hallucigenia had been suspected to be an ancestor of velvet worms, definitive characteristics linking them together had been hard to come by, and their claws had never been studied in detail.

Through analysing both the prehistoric and living creatures, the researchers found that claws were the connection joining them together. 

Cambrian fossils continue to produce new information on origins of complex animals, and the use of high-end imaging techniques and data on living organisms further allows researchers to untangle the enigmatic evolution of earliest creatures.

'An exciting outcome of this study is that it turns our current understanding of the evolutionary tree of arthropods - the group including spiders, insects and crustaceans - upside down,' said Dr Javier Ortega-Hernandez, the paper's co-author. 

'Most gene-based studies suggest that arthropods and velvet worms are closely related to each other; however, our results indicate that arthropods are actually closer to water bears, or tardigrades, a group of hardy microscopic animals best known for being able to survive the vacuum of space and sub-zero temperatures - leaving velvet worms as distant cousins.'

And Dr Smith added: 'The peculiar claws of Hallucigenia are a smoking gun that solve a long and heated debate in evolutionary biology, and may even help to decipher other problematic Cambrian critters.'
