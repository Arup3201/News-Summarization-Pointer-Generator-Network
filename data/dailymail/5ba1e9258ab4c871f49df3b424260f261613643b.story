Health officials today denied that a flesh-eating heroin alternative drug had spread to Ohio.

They said that three suspected cases of krokodil were not confirmed to be the lethal drug and that the most prominently reported case, in Columbus, was likely an infection from using dirty needles.

Surprisingly, a spokesperson for the Central Ohio Poison Control Center told MailOnline the lack of krokodil usage in Ohio may come from heroin being so readily available.

All three suspected Ohio cases, initially suspected to be the cannibal narcotic were something else entirely.

'It is my understanding that everything that’s been tested for has been negative,' the spokesperson said.

Testing for the drug failed to find codeine, the key ingredient that makes the krokodil authentic, the spokesperson explained.

Initial assumptions that people were taking the drug may have been rooted in skin conditions found on drug users.

'There’s a skin reaction associated with krokodil, causing some people to jump to the conclusion,' said the spokesperson.

'It’s turning out to be other types of skin reactions from using dirty needles,' the spokesperson added.

All three cases were likely simple infections from sharing needles with others.

Already suspected to be in Arizona, 
Illinois and Oklahoma, the lethal opiate gets its name from the 
greenish-black color and scaly appearance given to the skin of users – 
similar to a crocodile.

The spokesperson further added that one of the two Arizona cases did not test positive for the toxic drug.

Local officials immediately suspected the Columbus man had taken krokdil after he admitted to using the drug, and because of lesions on his skin.

‘The patient had a large, open wound and it is consistent with what we've been seeing, or the trend when people use [krokodil].’ Columbus Fire Deputy Chief Jim Davis told WBNS.

A call by MailOnline to the Columbus Division of Fire was not answered.

'It seems like a stretch in this case,' Dr Marcel Casavant, of the Central Ohio Poison Control Center told MailOnline. 'But injection drug users will do a lot of things before calling [for help].'

The lack of evidence supporting the usage of krokodil in Ohio is also being attributed by poison control officials to a surprising, and perhaps unexpected, factor.

'We’re guessing totally that it’s not an issue here is because sadly its much easier for people to get a hold of heroin here,' the spokesperson said.

'We have a major problem with heroin being extremely
available,' Dr Casavant added, explaining that Ohio is a hotbed for drug users.

'There’s still a very plentiful supply of all sorts of opiates available,' Dr Casavant said, adding 'I don’t expect that [krokodil is] going to be a big problem here.'

Given the lack of readily available codeine, which is the key ingredient in krokodil, the drug is harder to make.

In Russia, the spokesperson further explained, people have a much easier time finding codeine than they do heroin, both the doctor and the spokesperson noted.

People in Ohio who want heroin get heroin, many in Russia who want heroin settle for krokodil - and its devastating side effects.

Even though there is no evidence to suggest the 
deadly drug has found its way into Ohio, Dr Casavant cautioned that it 
doesn't mean people in the state aren't using it - but reiterated that 
he doesn't ever see it reaching the scale of epidemic currently seen in 
Russia.

Despite the lack of concern by officials, the deadly drug’s presence has been detected in multiple US states, and horrific images of the ravaged bodies of addicts are becoming commonplace.

At least one user, in Oklahoma, has died from using krokodil, others have suffered permanent damage from the drug – which literally eats the flesh of users from the inside- out.

Another user, in Illinois, told MailOnline of the horrors krokodil has inflicted on her.

‘It didn't take long before we both started to get these horrible deep sores on our bodies, particularly our arms and legs,’ former addict Amber Neitzel said.

The woman suffered ‘deep holes and the skin is just rotting away, it's hard to describe how revolting they are,' she said.

Despite having spent $100 on her last
stash of the vile narcotic, Ms Neitzel threw it away – a cardinal sin 
to an addict – when she discovered what it was.

A doctor who treated Ms Neitzel and her sister told MailOnline the drug’s use is widespread and pleaded with authorities to address it.

‘The
effects are the worst I have ever seen from any drug in all my years of
practice… I really don't know how it can be stopped, but it has to 
start with law enforcement.’

The Drug Enforcement Administration, for its part, has mostly downplayed the drug’s danger to communities.

’None of our forensic labs have analysed samples that became
krokodil,' DEA spokesperson Rusty Payne told MailOnline.

Ms Neitze told MailOnline she has been using the drug for over a year, and that its use is common.

Joliet, where Ms Neitzel is from, is close to Chicago - notably because Mr Payne said the Chicago field office of the DEA recently received a sample of a drug believed to be krokodil.

Testing revealed it to be heroin, said Mr Payne.

'Often times we get a sample of a chemical or substance, and its given to us believed to be one thing that turns out to be something
else,' said Mr Payne.

'This is what is happening, things are believed to be one
thing, and it turns out to be other substances,' he added.

Mr Payne also explained that dealers don't always know what they are selling, leading them to call something krokodil because that is the hot name, but have it be another synthetic drug.

Krokodil,
also known as desomorphine, is similar to heroin, but more powerful 
than morphine. The high is immediate, intense and cheap - but only lasts
a few hours.

Unlike heroin, which some people use for several years, krokodil is known to kill the majority of those addicted in only a couple of years.
