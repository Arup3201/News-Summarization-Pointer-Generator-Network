Nicolas Anelka's return to football after a ban for his 'quenelle' gesture ended in a 5-1 defeat in the Indian Super League.

The 35-year-old was banned for five-games by the FA after he performed the anti-semitic gesture having scored for West Brom against West Ham earlier this year.

Anelka signed for Mumbai City FC in September but missed the first three games of the season to complete his ban.

His return to action, however, proved forgettable as Mumbai lost 5-1 to Chennaiyin FC - their third defeat in four matches.

Anelka played the entire match but failed to shine, as former Manchester City midfielder Elano and Colombian striker Stiven Mendoza scored twice and Jeje Lalpekhlua netted once for Chennaiyin.

Syed Rahim Nabi scored a consolation goal for Peter Reid's Mumbai, who are now sixth in the eight team league.

Anelka has been without a club since he was sacked by West Brom for gross misconduct in March.

The former Arsenal and Real Madrid striker denied his use of the 'quenelle' gesture was anti-Semitic and that he made the gesture in support of his friend Dieudonne M'bala M'bala, a controversial French comedian.

Anelka was banned for five matches, fined £80,000 and ordered to complete an educational course. The report also stated: 'We did not find that Nicolas Anelka is an anti-Semite or that he intended to express or promote anti-Semitism by his use of the quenelle'

The FA had initially wanted a tougher punishment but did not appeal the sentence. Anelka did not appeal either.
