Jon Bon Jovi showed his support for embattled New York police officers last night by wearing an NYPD t-shirt on stage during his New Jersey concert.

The singer wore a 'Property of NYPD Football XXL' t-shirt for the Bobby Bandiera and Friends Hope Concert at the Count Basie Theatre in Red Bank, New Jersey, on Monday.

'I'm showing a little solidarity for my brothers in the NYPD and all of those who protect and serve us everyday, no matter what the risks,' he told the cheering crowd, the Asbury Park Press reported.

The show of support came two days after New York police officers Rafael Ramos, 40, and Wen Jian Liu, 32, were killed in an execution-style murder as they sat in their patrol vehicle in Brooklyn.

Supporter: Jon Bon Jovi wore a shirt reading, 'Property of NYPD Football XXL' for a concert in New Jersey on Monday night and said he was wearing it to show 'a little solidarity for my brothers in the NYPD'

The crowd at the Count Basie Theatre in Red Bank, New Jersey cheered as he explained his reasoning

Their killer, 28-year-old Ismaaiyl Brinsley, ran into a subway stop and shot himself dead.

Before the attack, Brinsley had posted on Instagram that he was going to put 'wings on pigs' in retaliation for the recent deaths of black males - including Eric Garner and Michael Brown - at the hands of white police officers.

Since Saturday's tragedy, many have flocked to support the families of the fallen police officers, including the youngest daughter of Eric Garner, Emerald Snipes-Garner. She attended a memorial for the police officers on Monday and also visited the home of Ramos' family, she said.

'It hit my heart because I know what it feels like with this upcoming season and you don't have your father around,' she said. 'I know firsthand what you're feeling.'

Other high-profile figures have also given their support to the police.

At the weekend, New York Jets center Nick Mangold headed to the field for Sunday's game against the New England Patriots wearing an NYPD cap, which he only removed after the coin toss. 

'Those two officers, it's a shame,' Mangold said, ESPN reported. 'Those guys, they do a great job.

'I've been here nine years. Every one of those guys that's out there, that risks their lives every day, to go out there and keep the community safe, protect the community - for that to happen, for those two guys, for their families, that's a raw deal.'

New York Giants' head coach Tom Coughlin also wore a black strip on the left shoulder and a small silver peace sign under the 'NY' logo on his chest in honor of the officers.  

'The New York Giants wanted to honor and mourn the assassination of the two New York City policemen that took place last night,' Coughlin said at a post-game news conference.

'Let's let the voice of reason prevail. Violence never solved anything. I realize there are issues, but solve them with non-violent means.' 

The New York Yankees' Yankee Silver Shield Foundation also said it would pay for the college education of Ramos' 13-year-old son, Jaden, as well as another son who is already in college, the New York Daily News reported. Liu, who was married in September, did not have children.

At Monday night's concert, Bon Jovi also performed 'The Letter' in memory of raspy-voiced British singer Joe Cocker, who died on Monday.
