George Gerbic, from the Sunshine Coast, was formally identified by police on Friday

Tributes have been paid to a 'well liked and much respected' former local football club president who has been identified as the victim of a horrific murder, almost a year after burnt remains of a headless torso were found on a Queensland roadside.

George Gerbic, from Tanawha on the Sunshine Coast, was formally identified by police on Friday.

This weekend his former football club Coolum FC donned black armbands in his honour.

Police discovered Mr Gerbic's headless remains, with arms severed at the elbows and nothing left below the rib cage, at Cedar Point, near Gympie, last September.

Detective Inspector Bruce McNab revealed a small trace of blood pressure medication in the remains had led to the identification of Mr Gerbic.

The 66-year-old was described on the football club's website as a 'well liked & much respected former President of Coolum FC'.

A tribute statement read: 'As a club and for those of us who knew him individually, we are incredibly sorry to hear of his tragic death and our hearts and deepest condolences are with his family and close friends at this sad time.

'As a mark of respect to George and the Gerbic family our club's senior players will be wearing a black armband for this weekends games and will be observing a minutes silence prior to kick off of their respective fixtures.'

The message finished: 'Rest in peace George.'

A 56-year-old named Lindy Yvonne Williams faced Maroochydore Magistrates Court on Friday charged with Mr Gerbic's murder.

The torso, found on Cedar Pocket Rd, pictured, in September 2013, was able to be identified when police found the the hypertension drug Irbesartan and Quinine in the body's system

Queensland police have been investigating the murder since last September

She is also charged with interfering with a corpse.

Police won't confirm reports the woman is his de-facto partner, although it has been revealed the pair lived together at Tanawha.

In court, police reportedly alleged Ms Williams had been saying her partner was overseas to explain his absence, News.com reports.

Their home was turned into a crime scene on Thursday - the same day police said they had identified the man and were questioning a woman.

In April police revealed they had detected traces of a drug called Irbesartan in the remains.

Doorknocking of prescription users in the area - following an exhaustive search of pharmacy records - had led police to the man's property.'

There's been a lot of technology used but also a lot of good old-fashioned detective work, wearing out your shoe leather,' Det Insp McNab said.

Ms Williams did not apply for bail and is due to appear again in court for a committal mention on September 1.
