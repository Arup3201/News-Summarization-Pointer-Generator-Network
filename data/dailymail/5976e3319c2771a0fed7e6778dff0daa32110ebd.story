It's been another busy week in the world of boxing and it's only going to get busier for me between now and May 31 – Wembley Stadium is a big stadium to fill but Carl Froch and George Groves have a better chance than anyone else of filling it. More of that later, though, because for now I want to talk about a fight that would excite me just as much.

I think Kell Brook would knock Amir Khan out. I'm positive about that. Now it's time to try to make the fight. That's the hard part.

I have spoken to Golden Boy Promotions, Khan's people in the US, and made Khan an offer of $5million. I'm not sure if it will happen this summer because Khan seems to be under the impression that he's above fighting Kell, but that is a fight I would love to see.

Khan needs to decide if that payday, and a fight of that scale, is worth turning down. I think turning it down would be a massive risk on his part and I'll explain why.

Kell will be warming up for his IBF title shot against Shawn Porter with a fight in Liverpool on March 15 and I can reveal here that it will be against the Mexican welterweight champion Alvaro Robles, who has 17 wins (15 KOs) and two losses. If Kell wins that, Shawn Porter will have to defend his IBF world title against him this summer. The only fight Kell would sidestep that for is Khan.

Khan has a lot to lose against Brook. If he gets knocked out, and I believe he will, I think that his career is over. He thinks he can fight Adrien Broner, Floyd Mayweather and then Kell Brook. The problem with that is Brook will go off and fight Porter and if he wins that title then there is no way Khan will be getting $5m as a challenger. Take your risks Amir, but realise what you are turning down.

Offer: Amir Khan has been offered $5m to fight Kell Brook

Below him? Khan seems to think fighting Brook (right) is below him

In either case, the next few months for Kell will be massive. After what he's been through, it is time something went his way.

He is 28 now and is an immense talent, a wonderful boxer who has won all 31 of his fights, but the past few years have just not gone his way. He should be a world champion by now.

His career was a textbook example of progression until he was meant to fight Devon Alexander for the world title in 2013. You couldn't make up what has happened since then.

Talent: Brook deserves something to go his way after what happened with injuries when he was meant to fight Devon Alexander

First, Kell injures his ankle and the 
fight is postponed. It gets rearranged and 10 days out Alexander pulls 
out with a bicep injury. Kell was his destroying sparring partners and 
ready to a job on Alexander. Alexander's withdrawal really hit Kell 
hard, he lost some of his professionalism and dedication in the sport.

He had a few weeks off, put on a bit 
of weight. We rescheduled the fight, came back and then he had a problem
 with his foot. He went to see a doctor and they said he had two stress 
fractures in his foot. That was hard for him to take. Three times that 
fight was cancelled!

He came
 back against Carson Jones and got the job done. Then he fought 
Vyacheslav Senchencko and looked fantastic. At that point he was due to 
fight Alexander in March or April of this year but Alexander lost to 
Shawn Porter. That was never supposed to happen.

Decisions: Khan wants to fight Floyd Mayweather but will be giving up a big payday if he sidesteps Brook

That was the same night Darren Barker fought Felix Sturm. I was sat watching the Porter fight with Kell in our hotel. The look on our faces. He just kept saying, 'I can't believe it'. What are the chances?

But Kell is over that now. He knows he is close to getting the huge fight he deserves. He is like my special project, a fighter who I respect and rate enormously. People might have given up on him, but I believe when he gets that chance he will rule the division. He has as much talent as any fighter in Britain and more than Khan. This will be his year.

 

Wembley is set for the biggest British boxing event of all time. I am delighted. My dream of an 80,000 capacity crowd could become a reality. Tickets will go on sale on Monday, March 10. Wembley and the FA have done everything they can the make the fight happen and it will be on HBO in America. I'm really excited.

We will put 60,000 on sale initially and I am confident they will fly away. In Manchester we sold 20,000 in 12 minutes and this is five times the size of the fight. I am anticipating huge sales on day one and two.

There will be a lot more more cheap seats and tickets will start at £30. I want it to be as accessible as possible. We already have 24,000 on our email alerts. If the average one of those wants three tickets, we will be well on the way to living the dream. You NEED to be part of it.

Massive: Froch-Groves II will be the biggest boxing event of all time - and tickets will start at just £30

 

If ever you could back a fighter to bounce back from a defeat then it would be Ricky Burns. He lost in Glasgow on Saturday against Terence Crawford, who just had too much for him. We hoped Crawford would crack under the pressure of being the away fighter – my word, it was some atmosphere - and we were keeping fingers crossed that he wouldn’t be as good as he has looked.

Unfortunately he had it all and Ricky probably wasn’t at his best coming back from an injury. I had a long chat with Ricky about his future on Sunday after the fight. He wants to be back in the gym as soon as possible.

He might even fight the winner of John Murray and Anthony Crolla, which I am hoping to make. There are some big domestic fights but the target for Ricky is ultimately to win back a world title. I'd back him to be on top before long. He's a warrior.

Bouncing back: Ricky Burns is a fighter you can expect to recover from a defeat

Top class: Terence Crawford showed he had it all

 

The demand for Anthony Joshua is at an all-time high. He gets mobbed everywhere we go. One thing that made me laugh recently was going up to Scotland for his fight at the weekend.

We went through security and this older lady came up to him and said: ‘I can’t believe it’s you’. Her mouth was wide open, she was totally awestruck.

He was saying ‘Thanks, that’s very kind,’ but then she just said: ‘I love your new dance show on Sky 1.’ She thought he was Ashley Banjo!
