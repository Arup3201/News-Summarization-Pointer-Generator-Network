A man rushed to hospital for a kidney transplant has spoken of the dilemma he faced after learning the donor organ could be infected with HIV.

Tony Gartside had waited four years for a donor organ before he finally got the call to say a kidney and pancreas had become available.

The transplant window was so small that after putting the phone down at 3am, he was rushed from his home in Plymouth to Oxford for the operation. 

But upon arriving, he was  told that the organs had come from the victim of a drugs overdose - and it would be two weeks before tests revealed if they were HIV free.

Tony Gartside, 40, had waited four years for a donor organ before he finally got the call to say a kidney had become available. But he faced a dilemma after learning the donor organ could be infected with HIV

Mr Gartside, 40, was born with type 1 diabetes, and his kidneys began to fail by the time he was 32. 

He said: 'They showed me into a room and told me the donor organs had come from a death by drug overdose and asked if I still wanted to go ahead.

'Because the person died by drug overdose, they wouldn't know whether the donor had HIV for two weeks.

'It was a scary process having to say yes or no after sitting in the back of an ambulance for hours.

'I thought: "Do I risk it and say yes, or do I say no and wait another 18 months, or even longer?"

'In the end, I went ahead with it.'

The kidney transplant surgery took 10 hours and left Mr Gartside with 32 staples in his stomach.

After the surgery, he was sick for days, unable to even stand up straight, and was concerned about the risk of HIV.

Two weeks later the HIV results came back - and were, to his relief, negative.

He has since made a full recovery.

Mr Gartside said: 'My diabetes has completely changed - it's amazing - and even that doesn't describe how good I feel.

'It's a second chance and I will be forever grateful to the donor's parents for making that decision.'

Two weeks after the kidney transplant, the HIV results came back - and were negative

He has now set up a support group for transplant patients - the Mayflower Support Group - which supports patients going through the transplant procedure.

He explained: 'Doctors have the clinical experience and can tell you what's going to happen during surgery, but they don't have a realistic explanation of what is going to happen for the patient.

'It's good to have someone to talk to who has been through what they're about to go through.

'The transplant has made me feel like I really want to give something back.' 

Last year, two patients in Wales died after being given kidney transplants infected with a parasitic worm.

Darren Hughes, 42, and Robert 'Jim' Stuart, 67, were each given a kidney from a transplant donor who was carrying the deadly worm in his organs when he died. 

Doctors were not aware the donor had the worm - known as Halicephalobus, which lives in soil and is found in horses - when the transplant operations were carried out at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff.

Mr Stuart and Mr Hughes began to 'deteriorate rapidly' after their surgery and died less than three weeks later.

The two men are part of only five cases ever recorded across the world - and all have died from the worm infection.

Mr Stuart, of Cardiff, and Mr Hughes, of Bridgend, had kidney transplants in November 2013 but both died before Christmas.

A post-mortem examination revealed they both died from infection called Meningeoencephaltis which was caused by the parasitic worm.
