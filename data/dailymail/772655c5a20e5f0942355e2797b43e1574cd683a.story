Warning: Frank Dobson told Tony Blair of the risks of his NHS reforms

A former Labour Cabinet Minister broke ranks last night and disowned Tony Blair’s government for the ‘reckless’ NHS shake-up blamed for the Mid-Staffordshire hospitals scandal.

Frank Dobson, Health Secretary from 1997-99, said he warned Mr Blair that a ‘mad rush’ to bring in more competition and targets in hospitals could harm patients. But Mr Blair ignored him and gave his Cabinet job to a crony who agreed to force through the changes.

Mr Dobson told The Mail on Sunday: ‘I told Blair that reckless changes could undermine patient care, but he didn’t want to listen.’

Mr Dobson criticised two of his Blairite successors as Health Secretary – Alan Milburn and Patricia Hewitt.

He said: ‘They became obsessed with wanting to break up the NHS into individual units.

‘I made my views known to them but was ignored. They preferred to take the advice of management consultants to medical consultants.

‘Huge sums were diverted  away from nurses, doctors and patients to lawyers, accountants and PR men.’

Mr Dobson’s comments echo David Cameron’s claim that rather than NHS boss Sir David Nicholson, past Labour Health Secretaries should take the blame for the Mid-Staffs scandal in which hundreds of patients needlessly died.

The Tories claim Labour has tried to save Sir David because many of his fateful decisions took place when the party was in power.

An official report last month said  the desire of Mid-Staffs health chiefs to seek elite foundation status contributed to the scandal.

Left-winger Mr Dobson was made Health Secretary when Tony Blair won power in 1997. He was forced out when Mr Blair appointed his close ally Mr Milburn to lead the drive towards foundation hospitals, with more competition and targets.

Mr Dobson said: ‘When I became Health Secretary, a number of professors of medicine said to me, “For God’s sake, Frank, keep change to a minimum or you will distract us from looking after patients.”

'I never forgot their words. When people go to hospital they want to be in the hands of someone trained at a London medical school, not the London Business School.

‘Mid-Staffs was desperate to become a foundation hospital but only looked at the money aspect. Forcing hospitals to compete with one another is not a good idea.’

Both Mr Milburn and Ms Hewitt were unavailable for comment.
