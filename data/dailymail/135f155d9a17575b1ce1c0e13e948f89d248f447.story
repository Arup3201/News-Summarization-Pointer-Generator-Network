Victoria Beckham gained over 57,000 new Twitter followers during New York Fashion Week, topping every other designer as the most talked about collection (17,173 mentions) on the social media site.

Marc Jacobs followed, but not closely, with 8,813 mentions, while designers Diane Von Furstenberg, Alexander Wang and Michael Kors took the remaining three popularity spots respectively.

On the heels of conversation surrounding the overuse of Twitter during Fashion Week, with popular thought being that it is stripping all intellect, wit and reflection of the collections with the increasingly fast-paced, and real-time tweets, it seems the designers aren't hurting at all.

Twitter superstar: Victoria Beckham gained nearly 58,000 Twitter followers during New York Fashion Week, topping every other designer as the most mentioned collection on the social media site

New York-based social media agency WhisprGroup analyzed layers of Twitter algorithms during New York Fashion Week to identify the most popular designers, trends, and hashtags associated with the last week's spring 2013 collections.

Hosted a runway show rather than her usual small presentation for the first time, former the former Posh Spice successfully slaughtered all other designers in the social media marketing arena during New York Fashion Week.

This may have had something to do with her tweet of Harper Seven, her toddler daughter, waddling down the runway just hours before the designer's show started.

Marc Jacobs, coming in at number two, had popular fashion blogger Leandra Medine of the Man Reppeller democratically hosting his collection livestream to the public, and the number three, Diane Von Furstenberg, surprised everyone with her Google Glass glasses, which walked down the runway on the models and the designer herself.

The number of tweets associated with New York Fashion Week, or #nyfw, doubled since last year's spring collections, with a total of 671,028 Fashion Week mentions.

The U.S. was the top country tweeting about the collections, designers and general goings on, taking up 72per cent of the total New York Fashion Week Twitter pie.

In comparison, the next New York Fashion Week Twitter-centric country was the UK, tweeting only five per cent of the overall mentions.

Enabling designers, stylists, photographs and journalists alike to turn the once media and buyer-specific week into an onslaught of mass self-promotion, street style overkill, and slightly strange endorsements more than ever before, it's clear Twitter and its zealous account users have no plans of slowing down, much to the pleasures of designer's marketing teams everywhere.
