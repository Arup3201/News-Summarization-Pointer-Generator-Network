An anti-Islamic organisation has released a Barossa Valley-grown wine, named Hal & Al's 72 Virgins, to help fund their movement.

The Q society, which is selling the sparkling wine in boxes of six for $72, advocates against Islam through various lectures and events which oppose the Muslim faith and  Sharia law

Their website claims that Islam is 'a political, legal, financial, social and military doctrine' that leads to violence and segregation and states that: 'since Islam is not a race or ethnicity, being critical of Islam is not racist'.

An anti-Islamic organisation the Q Society, has released a Barossa Valley grown wine, named Hal & Al's 72 Virgins as part of a fundraising project 

The wine, which references the belief that Muslim martyrs will be rewarded with 72 virgins upon entering paradise, ridicules the Islamic practice of not drinking alcohol.

'Consumption of this Australian wine may prevent you from entering the Islamic Paradise,' the bottle's label states.

'However, both the Jewish and Christian paradises remain open as alternative.'

Rather than recognise their beverage as offensive, the group has simply dubbed it a 'conversation starter'.

'I think it's a little bit tongue in cheek … not something that's meant to be taken too seriously,' Debbie Robinson, the Q Society's president told News Limited.

'I don't find it offensive. Everyone's an individual.'

Ms Robinson said that the wine had been selling well and that the organisation planned to use the funds raised from the sales to help bring speakers from overseas.

These lectures, given by 'non-Muslim scholars of Islam, authors, politicians and civil rights campaigners', address the group's member's 'concern about the growing impact of Islam and Sharia Law on Australian government, businesses and communities'.

The group also opposes halal certification schemes, which they claim are 'widely imposed on non-Muslims' through food taxes and employment discrimination in abattoirs.

Daily Mail Australia has contacted the Q Society for comment.
