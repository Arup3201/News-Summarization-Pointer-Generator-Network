Steam engine fan Karl Doran, seven, of Darlington, died at an open-air museum after he fell off the steam engine he was riding and was crushed

A schooboy volunteer at an open-air museum died after he fell off the steam roller he was riding on and was crushed by the trailer it was towing, an inquest has heard.

Karl Doran, seven, was standing on the tow-bar of the vintage steam roller being driven by his father Phillip, 41, in front of visitors to Beamish Museum in Stanley, County Durham, when he fell off it in July last year.

He was crushed by the 1.5 tonne trailer, the inquest at Crook Civic Centre, County Durham heard, and when his father noticed the trailer rocking, he looked around to see his son lying, lifeless, a few yards behind it.

The father and son, from Darlington, had been helping other volunteers work on the engines before setting off around the site in July last year.

Detective Chief Inspector Victoria Fuller, from Durham Constabulary, said Karl had been seen sitting on the tow bar by members of the public and that his father had asked him to join him in the engine after he began to drag his feet.

'Mr Doran became aware of the trailer rocking and he then realised that Karl was no longer on the engine,' she said.

'He noticed Karl lying about 15-20 feet behind the trailer on the road. He was not responsive and there were no signs of life.'

The inquest heard that the museum had not dealt properly with the risk assessment of towing trailers and the carrying of passengers and children.

Victoria Wise, from the Health and Safety Executive (HSE), said Beamish was aware that children would ride on the engines but that they relied on the competence of the drivers.

'Riding on a draw bar is a dangerous place to be, every year there are numerous accidents in agriculture where people are riding on draw bars,' she said.

'We would never allow a child or an adult to ride on a draw bar of a machine.

'Riding on the bar itself puts you between two pieces of moving machinery and its not designed to carry passengers.'

As a result the HSE issued Beamish with an improvement notice, which they took action on, though the investigation is still ongoing.

After instructing the jury to deliver a verdict of accidental death, Coroner Andrew Tweddle said it was a tragic case which no-one would have expected.

'This is a very simple case but an incredibly tragic one at the same time,' he said.  'No one, particularly Karl’s dad, would have expected things to turn out in the way that they did that day.

'I hope through the evidence being given this morning there will be lessons learned which will reduce similar fatalities in the future.'

Richard Evans, director of the museum, said the safety of their visitors was their top priority and they wanted to be an example of best practice.

Also known as the Living Museum of the North, Beamish Museum opened in its current form in 1970 and preserves life as it was in 1913.

Its thousands of objects and original, replica and relocated buildings are based on the early 20th century, late Victorian period and the Industrial Revolution of 1825.

They include a replica town, village, railway station and farm which helps preserve traditional and rare livestock breeds, as well as a mid-19th century drift mine.

The museum has won several awards, including the Sandford Award for Heritage Education 2011 and Living Museum of the Year in 2000, 2002 and 2004.

In 1986 it was named British Museum of the Year and the following year was crowned European Museum of the Year. Its supporters include Art Council England and the Heritage Lottery Fund.

Staff in period costume and visitors can get around using a steam railway, tramway, wagonway and old buses.
