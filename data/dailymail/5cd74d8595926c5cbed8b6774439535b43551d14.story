In 1491, German cartographer Henricus Martellus created a map of the world that would help Christopher Columbus navigate the Atlantic.

Today, the map holds secrets about what Europeans in the 15th Century knew about geography. But unfortunately much of its historic text has faded.

But now a team of researchers in the US is using a technique called multispectral imaging to uncover the hidden information that Columbus had at his fingertips.

The Martellus map depicts the Earth's surface from the Atlantic in the west to Japan in the east and is surrounded with descriptions in Latin of various regions and civilisations.

For instance, a text box over northern Asia describes the 'Balor' people who 'live without wine or wheat and get their nutrients from deer meat'. But much of the other text is illegible.

Scientists working as part of the Lazarus Project are now using a technique which involves capturing multiple images of the map at specific frequencies of light, including ultraviolet and infrared.

The images are digitally combined and processed in a way that uncovers information  otherwise hidden to the naked eye.

'The Martellus map is an incredibly strong candidate for this kind of technology,' said Chet Van Duzer, a map historian and the team leader for the project. 'You just know it's going to pop.'

The Martellus Map was created in 1491 by German cartographer Henricus Martellus.

It's said that Columbus used this map or one like it to persuade Ferdinand of Aragon and Isabella of Castile to support him in the early 1490s.

The map was made by a German cartographer living in Florence and reflects the latest theories about the form of the world and the most accurate ways of portraying it on a flat surface.

It seemed to prove that, as Columbus argued, there wasn't a great distance between Europe and China by sea.

The map is also the first to record the rounding of the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa by the Portuguese in 1488.

This proved that there wasn't a land link to Asia in the south - and that Europeans could reach the riches of the East Indies by sea without having to go through Muslim-held lands.

According to a report by Greg Miller in Wired, the team scanned the map last month and expect to start extracting text in the next few months.

As well as Professor Van Duzer, the project involved Roger Easton, a professor of Imaging Science at Rochester Institute of Technology, Dr Gregory Heyworth, an associate professor of English at the University of Mississippi and Ken 
Boydston, chief executive of Megavision.

As well as uncovering hidden details about civilisations depicted in the map, multispectral imaging could shed light on the history of map building.

For instance, the Martellus map has similarities to Martin Waldseemüller's world map of 1507 – the first map to apply the name 'America' to the New World.

In 2012, Professor Van Duzer had infrared and ultraviolet images taken of the Martellus map, which revealed enough of the hidden text to show that the map was a key source for Waldseemüller's 1507 map.

'One of the most exciting images I've ever seen of a map is an ultraviolet image of the Martellus map taken in the early '60s,' Professor Van Duzer told Wired.

'If you look at eastern Asia with natural light, if you look closely, you get a hint that there's text there, but if you look in ultraviolet light suddenly you see that there's text everywhere.'

He added that extracting legible text from all those images will take a lot of imaging processing and analysis. The project is expected to be complete sometime next year.
