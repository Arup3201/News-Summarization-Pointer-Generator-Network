The late Gough Whitlam's memorial service drew in crowds of thousands as high profile politicians and everyday supporters of the former Prime Minister flocked to Sydney's Town Hall to pay their respects.

But it seems the outfit of a news reporter covering the memorial on Wednesday has drawn its own kind of attention after stirring up conversation on social media.

Channel Seven reporter Samantha Brett crossed live from the service wearing a royal blue dress with  mesh detailing as she spoke with Sunrise hosts Samantha Armytage and David Koch.

A Twitter user voiced his concerns over the dress soon after by arguing it wasn't appropriate for a funeral given Ms Brett's cleavage could be seen under the mesh material.

'Are you kidding. Classless outfit given the occasion!,' the user tweeted Sunrise. 

But his tweet caused a flurry of other comments as people quickly jumped to the seasoned reporter's defence via social media.

Others claimed Ms Brett's dress wasn't revealing and many expressed their love for the dress

Some suggested it was absurd people were even debating how appropriate her dress was

'Not only was @samanthabrett delivery and segment perfect but she looked amazing!! The haters should look at their own mediocre life!!,' one tweet read.

'Absurd that we're even talking about @samanthabrett's dress. It's completely appropriate. She looks great. Move on,' another read.

A Twitter user shot down claims the dress was revealing when she said: 'There's nothing wrong with @samanthabrett's dress, it's not revealing, it's a high cut dress with sleaves.'

Ms Brett, who is a regular TV reporter with Channel Seven, has also published several books including the Seven Secrets Of Highly Successful Single Women

Ms Brett, attending a media event in 2012, has previously reported for CNN, CBS New York, BBC News, the E! Channel and Sky News
