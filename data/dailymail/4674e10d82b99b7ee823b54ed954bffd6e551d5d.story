A young woman has been arrested after she was found by a Florida homeowner sofa on her couch wearing the homeowner's pajamas.

Chancy Payton, 19, allegedly broke into the St Augustine home through an unlocked balcony door after she was told by a friend that the home would be empty.

Payton told police she entered the home, took a shower and dressed in the homeowners pajamas before making herself some food.

Rude awakening: Chancy Payton was discovered sleeping on a sofa belonging to Cheryl Petocz

The blonde-haired young woman fell asleep on the sofa but woke in shock after the homeowner arrived back at her apartment around 2:30am.

Cheryl Petocz was shocked to discover a blond-haired stranger sleeping in her home dressed in her clothing.

'Not what I expected to see when I walked into my house. We just stood there a bit, looking at each other, like, "What do we do?"' Petocz told News4Jax.

Petocz was able to snap a picture of the woman before she woke and left in such a rush that she left her bag - with her passport inside - behind.

'There was lots of bottles of wine that she drank. She was clearly not in a clear state.Â  I told her I was calling police. As soon as I said that, she grabbed few things and ran out the house, out the back door.'

St John's County deputies found Payton just a block away from the apartment, still dressed in Petocz's pyjamas.

Payton was reportedly apologetic, and wanted to return the pyjamas belonging to Petocz.

She began to have trouble breathing, reports News4Jax, and was taken to Flagler Hospital.

There, her mother arrived and told police the young woman had been suicidal.

Payton told police that she had wanted to 'escape' and find somewhere she could be alone.

The friend who told her about the apartment, known only as Jeremy, broke into the home and stole two bottles of wine, leaving the balcony door open for Payton, reports News4Jax.

Payton was examined at the hospital before being booked into St John's County Jail and released on $8,000 bail.

Police are now looking for 'Jeremy' who could face break-and-enter charges.
