A family returned home from a weekend away to find a car had crashed straight into their bedroom causing thousands of dollars of damage. 

The Scalzo family got back to their home in Meriden, Connecticut, after a weekend away in Pennsylvania to a scene of chaos with a flipped-over car in their bedroom, flashing police cars and fire engines.

'I saw all the flashing lights and the fire engines. At first we thought it was a fire or something,' Nick Scalzo told NBC Connecticut.

Flipped: The Scalzo family returned from holiday to find a flipped car smashed into their bedroom.

Police said that 70-year-old Ronald Wiesniak swerved to avoid hitting an animal, then lost control before he crashed his Toyota into the home on Round Hill Road - causing thousands of dollars worth of damage.

The family realise they could have been killed or seriously injured had they arrived home any sooner as the crash happened just 20 minutes before they returned from their weekend trip.

Chaos: The smash has caused thousands of dollars worth of damage and left the home filled with rubble.

'We could have been in there unpacking,' Mr Scalzo said. The accident has left the house filled with rubble, the walls are temporarily boarded up and the family are now left clearing up the mess.

'Just a complete disaster. It will be a mess for a while,' Mr Scalzo said.

Mr Wiesniak was rushed to the hospital with minor injuries. Meriden police are still investigating the crash and didn’t disclose if alcohol was a factor in the accident.

'Disaster': Nick Scalzo first thought there had been a fire and described the accident as a 'complete disaster.'

'They wheeled him away. They asked if he was speeding; he said he wasn't,' Mr Scalzo said.

Police told NBC Connecticut they questioned whether that was true and said the driver could have been going well over the 30 mph speed limit.
