Brazen: Thieves made off $1.9m worth of Apple iPad minis from the JFK airport cargo hold - the same site as the 1978 Lufthansa heist which inspired mob film Goodfellas

A cargo worker has been arrested over the brazen theft of $1.9 million in iPad minis from JFK Airport, according to authorities.

Federal agents arrested Renel Rene Richardson earlier this week because he allegedly made too many inquiries to co-workers about the incoming shipment of sought-after iPads, the NY Post reported.

Richardson also asked about where forklifts might be found, according to court papers obtained by the NY Post.

The daring crime occurred around midnight November 12, and the fork-lifting fugitives got away with about 3,600 iPad minis that were en route to China.

The cargo site where the theft occurred is exactly the same building where $5 million in cash and nearly $900,000 worth of jewellery went missing on December 11, 1978 during a heist later made famous in the mob flick Goodfellas.

Richardson worked in the Cargo Air Services building, and he had two co-conspirators in the crime, according to a criminal complaint filed in Brooklyn federal court and cited by the NY Post.Richardson is believed to have acted as a lookout, it was reported, while two unidentified individuals loaded two pallets of iPad mini's onto a truck.

Local detectives zeroed in on Richardson after learning of his alleged questions about the iPad shipments and airport forklifts from co-workers, the NY Post said.

Richardson was arrested by the FBI, and according to law-enforcement sources cited by the NY Post, he accompanied Port Authority detectives Wednesday night as they searched Long Island for the truck.

It's not yet known if the $1.9m in iPad's have been recovered.

Police suspected an inside job from the beginning, closely questioning all airport workers and giving three of them lie detector tests.Â 

The thieves were believed to have arrived at Building 261 around 11pm, in a white tractor trailer marked with the name CEVA on the side, it has been reported.

They pulled up to a side of the airport building which faces onto a street and has less security than the other side.

It is also accessible from the airport tarmac.

Cargo: The $1.9m worth of Apple iPad minis were taken from the JFK airport cargo hold

Airport sources believe someone let them into the area and then let them out after they grabbed the iPads.

The iPad thieves might have gotten away with more, but were foiled by three other workers returning from dinner break.

The crooks, who used the who
used the airport's own forklift to shift the haul of two pallets of 
tablet computers into a nearby truck, had to leave behind three other 
pallets full of valuable iPads.

In the  Lufthansa heist $5 million in cash and nearly $900,000 was taken, which if adjusted for inflation would be some $21million today.

The alleged mastermind of the robbery was Luchese crime-family associate James 'Jimmy the Gent' Burke.

He allegedly got away with the crime after 'whacking' nearly all of his co-conspirators in the heist.

The gangland bloodbath was recounted in one of the most famous sequences of the Martin Scorsese film GoodFellas, a film which has now reached cult status.
