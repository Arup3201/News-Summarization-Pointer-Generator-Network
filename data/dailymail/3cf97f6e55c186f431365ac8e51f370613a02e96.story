Newcastle United signed off from pre-season with a 1-0 victory over Real Sociedad on Sunday.

They face Manchester City in their Premier League opener next weekend.

But what did their win over the La Liga outfit tell us ahead of the new season?

Remy Cabella is a player

At £12million, he is the costliest of the summer signings but it looks a shrewd investment. 

He is tricky but tireless with it and was the one player who brightened an otherwise dull contest. 

He populates those pockets around a lone frontman – in this case Emmanuel Riviere – and is fearless in possession, constantly showing for the ball and picking probing passes.

Fearless: Remy Bacella was the costliest of the summer signings at £12million but looks a shrewd investment

The Toon Army are going to love Rolando Aarons 

The 18-year-old was introduced at half-time in a bid to inject some spark and that he did. 

The left-winger is a box of tricks with a blistering turn of foot and his willingness to run at opponents is a quality sadly lacking in the modern game. 

Like Cabella he plays without fear and that raw enthusiasm will endear him to supporters.

Bright spark: Rolando Aarons is a box of tricks and has a blistering turn of foot to twist his opponents

Jack Colback should have no problems winning over Newcastle

The former Sunderland midfielder swapped the Wear for the Tyne this summer in a controversial move.

No player has enjoyed more pre-season minutes and he is sure to start against Manchester City next Sunday. 

Interestingly, Pardew used him in an advanced midfield role against Sociedad but again he caught the eye with his refusal to surrender possession and put a shift in for his side.

No problems: Former Sunderland player Jack Colback swapped the Wear for the Tyne in a controversial move

In the action: Colback makes a tackle during the pre-season friendly and has been repeatedly picked to play

Moussa Sissoko needs games before he'll be back to his best 

The official records will mark him as the match-winner but the France international had been awful throughout. 

He was afforded an extended holiday following his involvement at the World Cup but he might as well have still been on the beach until his 88th-minute strike. 

He was sloppy in possession and lethargic in his motion – a big improvement is needed.

More time needed: Moussa Sissoko won the match with his goal but played awful throughout at St James' Park

Don't celebrate just yet, Moussa: Sissoko looked sloppy in possession and was disappointing overall

Pre-season has run its course! 

Yes, this dire affair thankfully signalled the end of the summer warm-up matches. 

Given its proximity to the new season perhaps those on display were holding something back or even feared suffering injury. 

Either way, as a spectacle it offered little and left everyone craving competitive football.

Rolando Aarons looks exciting, Jack Colback should have no problems at St James' Park, but what else did Sportsmail learn from the final friendly?
