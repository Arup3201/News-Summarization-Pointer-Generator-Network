A lesbian couple is fighting their sperm donor for full custody of their son after a judge accepted his bid to visit the child.

The case could redefine reproductive rights for same-sex couples in New Jersey.

Sheena and Tiara Yates of Pennsville, New Jersey, claim Shawn Sorrell, of Delaware, signed a contract they drew up, agreeing to relinquish his legal paternity over the boy born in 2013.

The child was conceived via at-home artificial insemination - a practice much cheaper than clinic procedures but not recognized under the law. 

In September, Sorrell requested to see the boy at weekends, while paying $83 a week in child support, and his appeal was granted.

Distraught: Sheena and Tiara Yates (pictured at their 2011 civil union) have been hit with parental appeals from both of their two sperm donors. They are fighting the second, whose son was born after they married

'Emotionally it's very hard for us,' Sheena Yates told NJ.com. 

'All we want is a family, and we can't have kids without an outside party. It's a lot for us to have to deal with. It's not just hard on us, it's hard on the kids, too.' 

The Yateses have had two children conceived via at-home artificial insemination, using the sperm of two donors.

But last year, both men filed for visitation with their children.

The first, father to the Yates's toddler, was granted parental time, which the couple accepted as they were not married at the time of his birth.

However, they are now fighting back against Sorrell, whose one-year-old son was born after they entered into a civil union.

Sons: They have had two boys via at-home artificial insemination. The younger (right) now sees his legal father Shawn Sorrell for a few hours each weekend. Sorrell also pays $83 a week in child support to the Yateses

He can now see the child a few hours each weekend, while paying $83 a week in child support. 

The rulings came despite the fact that the Yateses drew up contracts for the men, agreeing that they would relinquish their legal paternity.

The women opted for at-home procedures to avoid the $1,000 fee at a clinic.

But under the law, sperm donors retain their rights if the artificial insemination is done outside of a physician's office.

Disputes surrounding at-home insemination are treated as standard custody battles.

John Keating, the Glassboro-based attorney representing the Yateses, slammed the distinction as a significant obstacle for same-sex couples.

He also argues that the fact the women visited a physician for advice should act in their favor.

'We don't think this is an anti-LGBT decision,' Keating told NJ.com. 'But we do think it disparately impacts LGBT couples, and disproportionately impacts lower-income people.'

The Yateses hope that the fact of their marriage will strengthen their case that they are a strong united family who deserve full custody.

They entered into a civil union in 2011, and in 2014, a few months after their second son was born, they got married.
