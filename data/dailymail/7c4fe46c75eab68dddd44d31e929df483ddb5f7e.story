Jailed: Daniel Lovick, 27, has been jailed for two years after punching his girlfriend's stomach in an attempt to abort the baby

A man who punched his pregnant girlfriend in the stomach in an attempt to abort their baby has been jailed.

Daniel Lovick, 27, became angry when his partner revealed she was pregnant and made repeated threats about how he would terminate the pregnancy.

He pushed her down the stairs of her home, pulled out a clump of her hair and punched and kicked her in the stomach.

Lovick, who has a history of violence against women, escaped a longer sentence because the baby survived, a court heard.

He was a friend of the victim’s brother and began a relationship with her when she started visiting him in prison.

He started being abusive upon learning of the pregnancy just before Easter, telling his partner: 'You better get rid of that baby or I’ll kick it out of you.'

At 8.15am on May 19, he arrived at her home in Hull, East Yorkshire, let himself in and began shouting and swearing.

She asked him to leave but he refused.

He told her: 'You better go to the clinic and get rid of it. If you don’t, I’ll get a coat hanger and drag it out of you or I’ll stab you.'

Lovick then grabbed her and pushed her down a flight of stairs - seven steps in total - and she looked up to see him running towards her.

He grabbed her hair and began punching her in the stomach, saying: 'You’re not having the baby, I’m going to kick it out of you.'

The woman tried to protect her stomach by raising a leg.

Continuing the attack after she had got up, Lovick threatened to stab her, punched her 'three or four times' and pushed his thumb into her eye.

The victim managed to make a phone call to Lovick’s mother, who heard him in the background making further threats against the unborn child.

Hull Crown Court heard that before he left the property, he threw clothes around, pulled the blinds down, and smeared porridge on the walls.

The woman was taken to hospital, where a friend who saw her said she appeared to be 'in agony'.

She was bruised and had a bald patch at the back of her head where her hair had been pulled out, but the baby was unharmed.

Sentencing: The judge branded Lovick a 'violent bully' as he passed sentence at Hull Crown Court

Two
 days later, police saw Lovick walking down a road in west Hull, and he 
was arrested after attempting to hide in a garden. When questioned about
 the assault he claimed she was 'paranoid' and had slapped him.

The victim later described herself as being 'nervous, on edge' and 'frightened to be at home'.

Lovick, from Hull, who had 19 previous convictions for 34 offences, admitted assault occasioning actual bodily harm and criminal damage.

His own barrister, John Thackray, described the attack as 'disgraceful'.

Jailing Lovick for two years and three months, Judge Michael Mettyear, Honorary recorder of Hull and the East Riding, told him: 'You are a violent bully.

'You’ve got a terrible record, including offences of violence against women. You are a great risk to anybody who should be foolish enough to take up with you.

'You just can’t keep your temper and can’t keep your hands to yourself. This was a nasty attack on this woman and you ought to be ashamed of yourself.

'Fortunately, she wasn’t badly injured. Had you caused her to lose the baby or injured her further you would be facing a long sentence.'
