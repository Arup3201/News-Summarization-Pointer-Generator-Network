Roy Keane was spotted in the stands at Goodison Park on Monday night after his departure from Aston Villa.

Keane left his position as Paul Lambert's assistant after just six months in the job.

Returning to his post as Republic of Ireland No 2, the 43-year-old was present to watch Everton face Queens Park Rangers to monitor right-back Seamus Coleman.

And Coleman came out on the winning side as Everton triumphed 3-1.

Ross Barkley scored their first with a super strike which took a little nick off a defender, but it was nowhere near as big as the deflection Kevin Mirallas' free-kick got on its way in for No 2.

Steven Naismith headed in Aiden McGeady's cross for Everton's third, while Bobby Zamora scored a late consolation for QPR. 

Rangers have a horrible record on the road, losing all nine of their Premier League away matches this season.
