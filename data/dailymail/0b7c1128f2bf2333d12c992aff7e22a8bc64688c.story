Kevin Figaniak, 21, died in hospital after he and a friend were attacked
 by four men as they made their way back to campus on Labor 
Day weekend

Two men have been charged with the murder of  a Jesuit college student who was beaten to death after he and a friend were 'jumped from behind' as they walked back to campus from a bar on Labor Day weekend.

Craig Tyler Peacock, 22, of Clewiston, Florida, and Jarrett Mathis 
Chandler, 24, of Winnfield, Louisiana, were both charged with the murder of 
Kevin M. Figaniak.

The men were found in a camp for oil and gas workers and were arrested overnight.

They were arraigned and placed in the Northern 
Correctional Facility in Moundsville, West Virginia on $1 million cash bail 
each.

Kevin, 21, suffered severe head trauma in the attack near Wheeling Jesuit University at 1.45am on Saturday morning.

He died the next day at University of Pittsburgh Medical Center.

Kevin's friend - who was also attacked - told police the 21-year-old exchanged 'unpleasantries' with one or two of the men in the group before they attacked, Wheeling Police Chief Shawn Schwertfeger told The Intelligencer/Wheeling News Register.

The surviving victim, who has not been named, described the attackers as three or four white men in their mid-20s. Two of them had brown hair and were wearing jeans. Another wore a hat.

The arrests were made after police viewed video surveillance, social media sites and conducted interviews. More arrests may be made in the coming days.

Peacock and Chandler both agreed to 
give videotaped statements in which they acknowledged there had been a 
verbal altercation on Saturday morning at a bar.

They told police they followed Kevin and his friend afterwards to where the fight began.

Suspect Chandler 
specifically stated that he engaged in striking the individual he was 
fighting,' police said in the criminal complaint, obtained by Metro News.

Peacock
 told police he may have 'kicked' the man he was fighting.They left the 
area and left the men lying on the ground after the fight, police said.

Chief
 Schwertfeger said: 'We’ve located two. We are working hard still. 
There’s a lot of loose ends to be tied up and we are looking at trying 
to locate a third or fourth individual.'

The killing has shocked the Roman catholic university Kevin attended.

A statement posted by school officials said: 'We, the Wheeling Jesuit University 
community, would like to express our deep appreciation and heartfelt 
thanks to the alumni, friends, neighboring colleges and the local 
Wheeling community for your outpouring of love and prayers during this 
very difficult time on our campus.

'We ask that you keep Kevin Figaniak’s 
family and the WJU community in your prayers during this time of 
mourning.

'It is through this support that we 
draw the strength to cope with the loss of our fallen brother.'
