In the top job: New BBC boss George Entwistle has admitted he wrote to the corporation, aged 6, to complain over its coverage

Too few women appear on our TV screens, the new head of the BBC admitted yesterday.

George Entwistle said not enough had been done to promote female experts or ensure that they took part in news programmes.

‘We have made real progress in actively looking for, and finding, great female experts to front our big factual shows, but it’s not enough, and the world will always be profoundly demanding of the BBC on this question, and it should be,’ he added.

‘The Today programme struggles because we are dealing with party politics as it is, dealing with the world as it is, and that’s a very male place. What the BBC often reflects is the way the world is.’

In an interview with the Radio Times, he claimed progress had been made with female presenters such as Mary Beard of Meet the Romans and Lucy Worsley of Antiques Uncovered.

And the director-general said he would love to see the return of Miriam O’Reilly, the presenter who won an age discrimination case against the broadcaster after she was dropped from Countryfile.

When asked about Radio 4 newsreaders Charlotte Green and Harriet Cass taking voluntary redundancy, Mr Entwistle replied: ‘In what sense would it represent an advance of women’s circumstances to say, “We’re looking for volunteers for redundancy, you’re an older woman, you can’t have it”? It doesn’t sound particularly equitable, either.’

Complaint: A young Mr Entwistle writes to the BBC's 'derector'

George Entwistle has revealed that as a six-year-old child he had written to the then director general to complain that it had pulled an episode of Tom and Jerry after a Budget speech overran.

He has even still got a copy of the letter, which his father never posted, which shows he misspelt the job ‘derector’.

Mr Entwistle said: ‘I had misspelt it “derector”. My father, underneath, had written Broadcasting House, London, and then failed to post it – very typical of my dad.’

In an interview with Radio Times he also revealed he had suffered a ‘junkie habit’ for acclaimed US drama The Wire, watching it four or five hours a night.

On one occasion he said he watched a box set of the show from 9pm at night to 3am in the morning leaving him ‘totally wasted’ the following morning.

The BBC chief also revealed that as a child he was a massive fan of Doctor Who.

Looking forward to his new role he said he wanted to commission more Shakespearean productions following the success of the ‘Hollow Crown’ series.

When asked to compare BBC shows he admitted he preferred The Archers to EastEnders, The Apprentice over Dragon’s Den, Radio 3 over Radio 2 and Radio 4 over Radio 5 Live.

A clear fan of US drama he also revealed that he is ‘devoted’ to Mad Men, which the BBC lost to Sky after it rival bid significantly more for it.

He said that one or two episodes of the US-made series set in a New York advertising agency were ‘as close to poetry that it’s possible for television to come.’

Mr Entwistle said as a 12-year-old his parents thought it ‘strange’ he would go to bed listening to BBC news and arts radio programmes The World Tonight and Kaleidoscope.

He added there was barely a morning – ‘since I was aware of what was going on in the world’ – that he had not listened to Radio 4’s the Today programme.

He also revealed himself to among the army of fans who have fallen in love with BBC4’s Danish drama series Borgen and The Killing.

The BBC has faced continued pressure over its treatment of women on screen and notably those of older age. Research shows that men vastly outnumber female guests on its shows.

There have also been accusations of ageism over the way in which Arlene Phillips was dropped as a judge from Strictly Come Dancing in favour of the much younger Alesha Dixon.

Mr Entwistle’s predecessor Mark Thompson had admitted the broadcaster had a ‘case to answer’ over the lack of female presenters, especially in ‘iconic roles’.

In his maiden speech to staff, Mr Entwistle vowed to improve the quality of BBC programmes.

While highlighting the success of shows such as Luther, Sherlock, Call the Midwife, The Proms and the Great British Bake Off, he conceded that in some of its output the corporation settled for less than it should and said it was ‘time to admit to ourselves we can do better’.

Mr Entwistle said while he would work on fixing the things that got in the way of ‘creative quality’ in return he wanted staff to question whether what they were producing was as remarkable and original as licence fee payers deserved.

He warned: ‘I want everybody in the BBC to ask themselves this: am I using the extraordinary gift of public trust and public money to be original enough about the things I produce? Am I doing enough to challenge, lead, surprise and delight the people who pay for us?’

He said he would go to war on every bit of the BBC that was not ‘optimised’ for outstanding programming.

Mr Entwistle told the Radio Times: ‘My hunch is that there isn’t a single bit of the BBC that, in places, can’t do better.’

He also warned staff that internal competition, duplication, and briefing against colleagues needed to be stamped out.

Reform: The new director general said that he didn't think there was an area of the BBC that couldn't improve

Heralding a new era for the BBC, he said it needed to produce ‘genuinely digital content for the first time’ in an increasingly digital age.

He also said the BBC should fight to keep some of its stars, but not by digging deeper into its wallet.

Mr Entwistle also promised to take the BBC’s winning Olympic formula which ensured ratings success and make it work for other events. However he admitted that BSkyB was in a different league when it came to bidding for top sports rights.

He said his corporation would maintain a ‘serious commitment’ to sport and wanted to build on the legacy of the London Olympics, including placing a new focus on women’s sport.

But, he said the massively expensive deals for live football were now out of its reach.

The BBC has already decided to split the live rights to Formula One with Sky and some analysts fear that more events will follow.

The BBC’s top woman executive is to leave the corporation, it was announced yesterday.

Caroline Thomson – who last year earned almost £330,000 as chief operating officer – had been expected to go after losing out to George Entwistle for the director- general’s job.

The 58-year-old’s post is being axed and the division she ran is being dismantled.

She first joined the BBC after starting as a trainee journalist in 1975 and was a key player in the licence fee settlements in 2007 and 2010.

She will leave next week with a £1.71million pension pot and could get up to 12 months of redundancy pay.

She is not planning to retire.

Since the BBC began publishing the expenses claims of its top executives, her taxi claims have received attention with her regular use of cabs costing thousands of pounds of licence fee money each year.

She said: ‘It has been an immense privilege to be part of the leadership of the BBC – the world’s best public service broadcaster.

‘Wonderful programmes, brilliant colleagues and a real sense of public purpose, what more could you ask? I wish George and his colleagues the best of luck as they take the BBC forward – I know it will be safe in their hands.’

Chief financial officer Zarin Patel is also leaving in the coming months

Mr Entwistle said: ‘I want to mark this moment by paying tribute to Caroline’s enormous contribution to the BBC over many years now. She was pivotal in winning the last charter for us, when her impeccable strategic leadership helped deliver a clearly defined ten-year mission for the BBC, securing our purposes and funding through to 2016.’

Chief financial officer Zarin Patel, who earned £337,000 last year, is also to leave in the coming months.

She found herself at the centre of the row about the BBC’s payment of stars through personal service companies after she appeared in front of MPs about the issue.

Insiders say it was known that Miss Patel had been looking for a new challenge and that Mr Entwistle was aware of this. The decision was said to have been mutual.

But before she goes the finance chief will spend the next 12 months setting up a new finance and business division with the director-general.Miss Thomson, 58, is married to the former Blairite advisor Lord Liddle – her second husband – and has one son.

She studied at Mary Datchelor Girls’ School, a grammar school in Camberwell,  South London, and the University of York.

After first joining the BBC as a trainee journalist 30 years ago, she went on to produce radio and television programmes including Panorama.

She left to work as political assistant to Roy Jenkins, then the leader of the SDP, during the 1983 general election campaign and joined Channel 4 the following year as a commissioning editor, later becoming head of corporate affairs.

She rejoined the BBC as deputy director of the BBC World Service in 1996 and has worked there ever since.

Earlier this year she was tipped to become the corporation’s first ever female Director General.

After Mr Entwistle’s announcement yesterday that she would be leaving by the end of the month, she was reported as telling friends she has no plans to retire and was ‘exploring a few possibilities’.
