Cristiano Ronaldo has explained the strange noise he made during his acceptance speech after winning the 2014 Ballon d'Or. He said it was a celebration that he often performs with his team-mates at Real Madrid.

The scream did not take long to go viral and sparked intrigue about the media. 

National and global press had been trying to work out the forward's motives behind the noise, while several parody videos and memes had also started to appear on social networking sites.

But Spanish journalist Guillem Balague was already clued up. He said on Twitter, 'In case you wondered, Ronaldo's war cry is Siiiiiii. Yeeees. I know it doesn't sound like that but that's what he says he shouts.' 

Ronaldo himself then confirmed to Spanish television station Cuarto that the noise was part of a Real Madrid celebration. 

He said, 'The scream? The players know I always do that shout when I score a goal or when we win - it's our team shout.'

Portuguese magazine Abola says Ronaldo's rallying cry means he is now looking to match Lionel Messi 

The Portuguese forward was crowned the best player in the world for the third time in his career, and for the second consecutive year.

Ronaldo was presented with the award at a ceremony held in Zurich on Monday evening after he received 37.66 per cent of the vote, finishing ahead of Barcelona's Lionel Messi (15.76 per cent) and Bayern Munich's Manuel Neuer (15.72 per cent).
