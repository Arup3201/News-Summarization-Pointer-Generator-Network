Jen Palmer (pictured) and her husband John have threatened to a lawsuit against Kleargear.com after it fined them $3,500 for posting a negative review

A couple who were charged $3,500 for writing a bad review about an online shop have fought back and filed their own $75,000 lawsuit.

Jen and John Palmer say their credit rating was damaged by the Kleargear.com fine and have appointed Public Citizen to represent them.

Mr Palmer ordered a trinket from the company in 2008 but the order was cancelled when it was not delievered within 30 days.

Mrs Palmer then wrote a negative review on Ripoffreport.com, slamming the retailer's 'incompetent customer service' and 'refusal to ship products to San Antonio, Texas'.

However, Kleargear sent them a demand notice three years later to get the review removed and when that was not done fined them $3,500.

The company claimed Mrs Parlmer had violated a 'non-disparagement clause' buried in the sale terms and conditions.

The couple, who live in Layton, Utah, say Kleargear reported their 'debt' to credit agencies, and say they have since been rejected by numerous lenders.

For the Palmers, it all started nearly five years ago when John decided to order his wife a desk ornament from the Texas-based Kleargear.com as a Christmas gift.

The company was unable to deliver the trinket worth less than $20 within 30 days and ultimately cancelled the order altogether, leading Mrs Palmer to complain about 'horrible customer service practices' in her online review.

'Once we put the review up we pretty much forgot about it,' Jen Palmer, an executive assistant, told ABC News. 'It was no different than writing a review, good or bad, about any company.'

But the long-forgotten written critique came to haunt the couple last summer when John Palmer, a network engineer, got an email from Kleargear demanding a $3,500 fee for disparaging the company in violation of its Terms of Use.

'We were blown away,' Mrs Palmer recalled their reaction to the demand.

Nonprofit group Public Citizen have now sent a letter to Kleargear threatning to file a lawsuit unless the situation is remedied.

They have given them until December 16 to rectify the situation with the credit reporting agencies and to compensate them $75,000.

The letter to Kleargear states the damaged credit rating meant they were refused a $1,900 loan for a new furnace which left them and their 3-year-old son without heating for three weeks.

A credit card and a car loan application were also rejected and they are struggling to sell their home and buy a new one, it said.

When the family disputed the debt with credit reporting agencies, Kleargear demanded a $50 'dispute fee' on top of the $3,500.

Mrs Palmer told ABC News they were 'floored' when they received the letter.

She said: 'The threat of doing it was scary enough, but the extent to which they did it blew my mind.'

She said she attempted to get the review removed from the website but when that failed refused to pay the fine.

This is Jen Palmer's critical post on ripoffreport.com for which she was fined $3,500

The Kleargear clause stated: 'In an effort to ensure fair and 
honest public feedback, and to prevent the publishing of libelous 
content in any form, your acceptance of this sales contract prohibits 
you from taking any action that negatively impacts kleargear.com, its 
reputation, products, services, management or employees.'

Kleargear.com appears to have removed 
the clause from its terms of sale within the last couple months. It 
appeared on the website as recently as August 2013.

The couple's attorney, Scott Michelman, told ABC: 'No one would have expected this 
from doing perfectly normal, everyday and perfectly legal things.'

'I have the right to tell somebody else these guys ripped me off,' Palmer said.

KUTV previously said the company defended its policy, saying the clause was a 'term of sale'.

The company also said requiring Palmer to remove the 
post or face a fine was a 'diligent effort to help them avoid [the fine]'.

Mail Online has attempted to contact Kleargear for comment.

Jen Palmer claims she and her husband have been rejected by several lenders because Kleangear.com reported her 'delinquency' to credit companies

Palmer is not the first person to complain about the retailer, with dozens of similar criticisms on Ripoffreport.com.

Moreover, the Better Business Bureau slapped the company
with an 'F rating' in 2010 for 'not delivering products purchased 
online in a timely manner'. Kleargear.com today has a 'B rating'.

Salt Lake City First Amendment attorney, Jeff Hunt a judge would likely consider a non-disparagement clause unconstitutional.

'I
think this is outrageous that a company like this would force a 
consumer to relinquish their first amendment rights to speak about their
product as a condition of sale,' Hunt told KUTV.

'I have a serious question about whether a court would enforce that kind of covenant because it's massively over broad and against public policy.'
