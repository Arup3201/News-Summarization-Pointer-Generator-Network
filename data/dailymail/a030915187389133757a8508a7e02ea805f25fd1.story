£20m turnover: Food writer Mrs Karmel helped develop a menu for BHS, but a nutritionist complained that the menu listed burgers and sausages as 'healthy'

As a children’s food guru,  Annabel Karmel built a multi-million-pound empire telling parents how to cook healthy meals for youngsters.

And after lucrative contracts with the likes of Disney, retail chain BHS signed her up to develop a children’s menu for their restaurants.

But Mrs Karmel, who was awarded an MBE in 2006 for outstanding work in child nutrition, has been forced to backtrack on claims that her food was ‘healthy and nutritious’ – after a leading expert reported her ‘outrageous’ claims to a local council.

Harley Street nutritionist Yvonne Bishop-Weston was horrified when she saw the dishes, which included burgers, sausages, chips and ice cream, were being promoted on posters and menus as healthy options.

‘It is outrageous that food such as burgers, sausages, and sugary snacks are being advertised as healthy,’ she said.

‘Parents and children are bombarded with healthy eating messages. But they are now being faced with confusing advertisements in their local shopping centre for healthy kids’ meals.’

Miss Bishop-Weston contacted trading standards officers in Croydon, South London, who took up the claims with  executives at the store. And the chain, which is owned by billionaire Sir Philip Green, has now agreed to change the wording on the menus.

Neil Alcorn, from the food and safety team at Croydon council, said: ‘We have been told they have had several high-level meetings with Annabel Karmel regarding the wording for the children’s meal boards in the store and have agreed that the word “healthy” will be removed from the menu boards.’

In a joint statement, BHS and Mrs Karmel said: ‘New menus will not include the word “healthy”. Instead, they will focus on specific nutritional benefits of each individual product.

‘All of the meals sit within  Government nutritional guidelines per meal for children aged five to ten.’

Despite the climbdown, the self-appointed ‘UK’s number-one parenting author’, whose business has a turnover of more than £20milllion, is still claiming the dishes are ‘nourishing’ on her company’s website.

The site says: ‘I’m so excited about the range I have developed for BHS restaurants. The tasty nourishing meals for kids assures parents that their little ones are being served food that is healthy and nutritious.’

Miss Bishop-Weston welcomed the store’s climbdown as a ‘small victory,’ but said she would have preferred the menus to have been overhauled – offering food that was ‘actually healthy’.
