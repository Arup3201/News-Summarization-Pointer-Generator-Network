Mothers of serving soldiers have posed for a raunchy calendar to raise money for military charities.

The fundraiser was the brainchild of Karen Roper, from Stockton-on-Tees, North Yorkshire, whose 18-year-old son is in the Army. She managed to convince fellow army mothers to take part - with some being more daring than others.

While their intentions are admirable, their sons and daughters may turn more-than-a-little crimson when they see their mothers posing provocatively in the calendar shots.

Miss February: This mother wears a broad smile and nothing else in her shot for the charity calendar

Dare to bare: Many of the mothers, all of whom have children serving in the armed forces, opted to pose topless, like Miss November, left and Miss March, right 

Serious posing: While most of the women took their photograph themselves, others seem to have gone down the professional route like Miss September 

All of the mothers got involved following an appeal from Karen via Facebook and then submitted selifies or more professionally posed pictures.

The woman are in various states of undress in the calendar, which will hit shelves by the end of next week.

Some chose to go for a good-humoured shot, donning army camouflage, face paint and pulling funny faces - while others pout provocatively into the lens with little preserving their modesty.  

Money raised will go to two charities, Soldiers Off The Streets, which helps homeless ex-servicemen, and Talking2Minds, which helps veterans dealing with PTSD.

Rocking around the Christmas tree: Miss December took a festive approach after volunteering to take part in the project after seeing an appeal on Facebook

All for a good cause: The mother on the left was used on the cover, while pictured right is Miss May who opted for a demure look. Money raised will go to two charities, Soldiers Off The Streets and Talking2Minds

Fundraising: The calender goes on sale next week and can be bought by emailing Karen@holderprint.co.uk

Karen said: 'All the ladies taking part have sons and daughters in the Armed Forces, many of them have served in Afghanistan.

'The response was far better than I imagined and it was great the way all the mums just joined in and we have had a lot of laughs this weekend.

'Our boys and girls do so much for us, we wanted to give something back.

'Some of the mums have a military theme, others have just done nice pictures and we are going to put a military border round them.' 

The calendars are on sale for £5 and people can buy them by emailing Karen@holderprint.co.uk
