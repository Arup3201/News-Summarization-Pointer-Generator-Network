Warrant: Tariq al-Hashemi, Iraq's top Sunni official, is set to be arrested

Iraq's top Sunni official is set to be arrested on terrorism charges by the country's Shiite-led government.

Just a day after the last U.S. troops left Iraq at the end of the eight-year war, the moves signals a sharp escalation in the sectarian tensions that drove the country to the brink of civil war a few years ago.

An arrest warrant has been issued for vice-president Tariq al-Hashemi after state-run television aired what it claimed were confessions by alleged terrorists linked to him.

Since the 2003 invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein and his Sunni-dominated Baath party, the Sunni minority has constantly complained of attempts by the Shiite majority to sideline them.

Mr Al-Hashemi is one of the leaders of the Sunni-backed political bloc Iraqiya, which has just suspended its participation in parliament to protest against the control of key posts by Shiite prime minister Nouri al-Maliki

The boycott, headed by Ayad Allawi, was in response to the government's failure to share more powers, particularly authority over the security forces.

Iraqiya narrowly won the most seats in last year's parliamentary election, but Mr Allawi was outmanoeuvered by Mr al-Maliki, who kept the premier's post after cobbling together key support from Shiite parties.

For over a year now, Mr al-Maliki has effectively controlled the interior and defence ministries, which oversee the police and military, while conflicts between Sunni and Shiite politicians have delayed the appointment of permanent ministers.

The dispute is a reminder that the West left behind an Iraq still riven by sectarian division. The last American troops crossed the border into neighbouring Kuwait early on Sunday.

Mr al-Hashemi has denied charges he ran a hit squad that killed government officials during the wave of sectarian bloodletting and accused the Shiite-led government of persecution.

'I'm shocked with all these things,' he said. 'I swear by God that al-Hashemi didn't do any sin or anything wrong against any Iraqi whether today or tomorrow and this my pledge to God.'

He blamed prime minister Nouri al-Maliki for waging a campaign to 'embarrass' him.

He added: 'Al-Maliki is behind the whole issue. The country is in the hands of al-Maliki. All the efforts that had been exerted to reach national reconciliation and to unite Iraq are now gone.'

Al-Hashemi is in Iraq's semi-autonomous northern Kurdish region and is not in custody. He thanked Iraq's President Jalal Talabani, a Kurd, for his support and said that Talabani promised he would be responsible for his security.

The vice president said security officials had come to his office and house and taken computers and documents. He said the staff working in his office were asked to turn in their badges and told to go home.

Al-Hashemi also sought to play down speculation that he would flee the country. He said that while he might leave for a short period of time, he would always return to Iraq.

By 2007, the number of sectarian attacks in Iraq - many of them within 30 miles of the capital Baghdad - was virtually at a civil war level.

Hundreds are still killed by sectarian groups or insurgents as they seek to exploit the government.

As the U.S. military leaves the country, there are fears it could again erupt into civil war, with ethnic unrest spilling over into neighbouring countries including Jordan and Syria.

An Iraqiya MP warned that the party could pull its seven ministers out of the coalition government if its demands are not met.

In a statement issued on Saturday, Iraqiya criticized the 'unjustified' random arrests conducted by the government's security forces in Sunni areas.
