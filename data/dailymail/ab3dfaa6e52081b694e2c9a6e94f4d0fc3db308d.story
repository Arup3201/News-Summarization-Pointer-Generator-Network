Arsene Wenger might not be on friendly terms with Jose Mourinho, but the same can't be said for Arsenal's record signing.

The two managers clashed as the Gunners lost 2-0 to Chelsea at Stamford Bridge, but Mesut Ozil was spotted sharing a moment with Mourinho shortly after the game.

Mourinho signed Ozil from Werder Bremen when he was in charge of Real Madrid and spent three years coaching the German international.

The sight will likely rile many Arsenal fans, especially considering Mourinho's persistent baiting of their manager. 

The incident was reminiscent of one Andre Santos was involved in two seasons ago. 

The Brazilian hugged and swapped shirts with Robin van Persie after the former Arsenal captain scored against them for Manchester United.

Chelsea's win takes them five points clear at the top of the Premier League table while Arsenal have slipped to eighth.
