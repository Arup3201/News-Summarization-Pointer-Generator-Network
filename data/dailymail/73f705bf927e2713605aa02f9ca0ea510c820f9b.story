For most toddlers, the odd sweet is a treat. But for Evan Grimes, just one mouthful of the wrong food could be deadly.

Evan, from Baltimore, Maryland, is so allergic to everything he comes into contact with he has to wear mittens to stop him from scratching the painful hives which he battles on a daily basis.

If fed citric acid, a common food additive found in soft drinks and sweets, or bread, the toddler could face losing his sight permanently or even death if he didn't have his EpiPen.

Evan Grimes, with mother Tonya, has so many allergies that he can only eat 11 foods

Evan, now 18 months, suffers such bad reactions to certain foods that he scratches his skin raw

And to prevent the long list of other dangerous allergies from flaring up, Evan is only allowed to eat just 11 'safe' foods.

His mother Toya, 28, first noticed her son's allergies when he was just two months old after the skin around his eyes became severely infected.

Doctors prescribed steroids to try and calm down the reactions, but Evan continued to suffer painful breakouts which would leave the skin on his face raw and paper thin.

Mrs Grimes said: 'When he first started showing signs of allergies, I would put little baby mittens on him so he wouldn't scratch.

'But he would itch so bad he would use the entire mitten to rub his face raw.

'I didn't have a clue what foods he was allergic to, so he would itch and scratch all night until he bled.

'By the time we got up in the morning it looked as if someone had been murdered in the bed.'

A dermatologist suggested that Evan might be allergic to citric acid, as the attacks seemed to coincide.

But even 
after another serious breakout of hives, Mrs Grimes claims aims that 
doctors refused to give Evan an allergy test, saying he was too young.

Dust
 mites, cats, dogs, cockroaches, barley, malt, oats, rye, soybean, 
wheat, white potato, dairy, bacon, sausages, shrimp, salmon, egg, 
peanut, walnut, coconut, lemon, beef, chicken, clams, corn, rice, 
sweets, sweet potato, lettuce, tomato, onion, pecan, papaya, lime, 
orange, cherry, peach, strawberry, banana, avocado, mango, kiwi, 
grapefruit, chilli, pepper, melon.

She said: 'I told them he was suffering, screaming, crying and bleeding every day, but they wouldn't listen.

'That is too much for a baby to go through and by this point, I felt totally hopeless. There was nothing I could do.'

But by the time Evan was 15 months old, she had managed to book an appointment with a skin specialist.

'She cried when she saw Evan and immediately approved him for a blood test,' Mrs Grines said.

Evan
 tested positive for 46 allergies, including citric acid, potatoes, 
nuts, wheat and dairy and was referred to a paediatrician, a 
dermatologist, an allergist and a nutritionist to help keep his 
allergies at bay.

Mrs Grimes said: 'It has been a horror story from the beginning until he was tested for allergies.

'Since then, I've been worrying non-stop and making sure I monitor closely what he's exposed to.

'I'm just terrified he'll get a hold of something he shouldn't.'

Evan's strict diet now consists of just 11 items: Turkey, string beans, carrots, apples, grapes, pears, greens, kale, beetroot, broccoli, and allergen-free cereal

Over the past few months, she has finally identified a narrow list of low-reaction foods which are safe for her son to eat.

His strict diet now consists of just 11 items: Turkey, string beans, carrots, apples, grapes, pears, greens, kale, beetroot, broccoli, and allergen-free cereal.

However Evan, now 18 months, still has extremely sensitive skin and must be near an EpiPen at all times in case he suffers a reaction.

His mother said: 'Things have got better, but something as simple as a soft drink could leave him blinded for life.

'Evan's actually very good about not eating things he's allergic to but it's difficult to keep an eye on him all the time.

'I couldn't even count the number of times I've had to tell people he's not allowed to eat candy or cookies.

'But he doesn't let it get him down though, he's always smiling. It's a massive challenge but I'm certain we will be able to battle through it together.'
