The U.S. Department of Labour fined three strawberry growers $73,000 after finding children between the ages of six and 11 working in their fields.

The children were found working in fields of George Hoffman Farms, Columbia Fruits LLC and Berry Good Farms  in southwest Washington.

While an exemption in the federal child labour law allows 12 and 13-year-olds to work for unlimited hours on large agricultural operations, children under the age of 12 are strictly prohibited from working under similar conditions.

Illegal activity: An ABC investigation found dozens of children aged six to eleven working on strawberry fields in Washington

Culprits: Columbia fruit LLC, George Hoffman Farms and Berry Good Farms were found to be in violation of minimum wages laws and fined $73,000

Two of the southwest Washington state 
growers cited with fines - George Hoffman Farms and Berry Good Farms - 
were found to be in violation of minimum wages laws.

Them, along with Columbia Fruit LLC, have taken steps to remive the underage workers from their fields and will be required to attend training 
conducted by the federal government over the next three years, according
to a Department of Labor statement.

Andrea Schmitt, an attorney with Columbia Legal Services in Olympia, told ABC that the low wages made by workers in the Northwest berry industry are a key factor driving young kids into the fields.

She said that berry pickers, who are usually paid a piece rate instead of an hourly wage, often struggle to make the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour.

Harm: As well as dangers of sharp tools and pesticides, the kids hurt their knees and backs from the hard labour they are forced to do

She said: 'Minimum wage laws are not being followed with the adults who are working in this industry. Across the board, we see people making $5 or fewer an hour.

'People can't make minimum wage by the piece and so if they have another set of little hands adding to the pile of berries, they might be able to make enough to live on.'

She said that harvesting low-growing strawberry plants can be arduous work for children.

'The kind of work that kids are doing on
commercial farms, I think, is fundamentally different than the kind of 
berry-picking people did as kids 50 years ago.

'We're 
talking about kids who are picking 100 to 200 pounds of berries a day. 
In strawberries, that's a lot of stooping and standing.

'They complain to
us about backaches - their backs hurt when they sleep at night - and 
we see these horribly bruised knees.'

The $8,117-per-child penalties assessed in the recent Washington cases 
appear to be a significant increase from the $1,100-per-child average 
fine charged to blueberry growers in Michigan, Arkansas and New Jersey 
found to be illegal employing under-age children in the summer of 2009.
