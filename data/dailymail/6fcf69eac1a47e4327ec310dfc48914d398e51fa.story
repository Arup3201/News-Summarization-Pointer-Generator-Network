Brazilian Felipe Nasr has joined Sauber in a shock appointment.

Just days after announcing Marcus Ericsson as one of their drivers for 2015, the cash-strapped Swiss marque have now decided on an all-new driver line-up for 2015 by bringing Williams test driver Nasr on board.

It means Adrian Sutil and Esteban Gutierrez must find new drives for next year.

Brazilian Felipe Nasr will race for Sauber next year in a surprise move by the Formula One team

Nasr was Williams test driver this season and is seen here during practice for last weekend's US Grand Prix 

Nasr's appointment is likely driven in part by his ability to bring in around £10-12million in personal sponsorship from Banco do Brasil.

Ericsson, previously with Caterham who are now in administration, adds another £10-12million.

Team principal Monisha Kaltenborn said: 'We have been following Felipe's career path for some time now, and he fully deserves his position in Formula One having had a very successful career in junior categories.

'We are happy he will be driving for our team next year. This means that Brazil will have one more young and talented driver in the sport.

Marcus Ericsson will team up with Nasr at Sauver having been at Caterham who are now in administration 

'Banco do Brasil has been an important partner for Felipe so far, and we are delighted such a renowned company is continuing to support him during this important step. We look forward to this partnership.'

Nasr, 22, a former British Formula Three champion GP2 runner-up this season, said: 'It is a very important step in my career to sign with Sauber for the 2015 Formula One world championship.

'This is an unforgettable moment I owe to all of those who have supported me - my family, my friends, my sponsors, my teams and my country.

'Today the dream has come true. Sauber was responsible for the arrival in F1 of great names such as Felipe Massa, Kimi Raikkonen, Robert Kubica and Sebastian Vettel.

'I am proud now to also be part of this racing family. I had a wonderful year at Williams where I learned a lot and prepared myself to be a race driver in Formula One.'
