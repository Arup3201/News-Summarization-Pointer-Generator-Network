More than 100 of the country's most dangerous sex attackers -  including paedophiles and violent rapists - have had their names secretly removed from the Sex Offenders' Register, it has been revealed.

The criminals have used a human rights ruling to remove themselves from the list, arguing that they no longer pose a threat to the public.

The 108 convicts who have successfully used the argument, include one offender convicted of
 rape of a female under 13, another of burglary with intent to rape and 
one sentenced for buggery.

One police force removed a criminal convicted on seven counts of indecent assault on a boy under 16 from the register.

The figures were obtained under the Freedom of Information act, and asked for details of the number of 
convicted sex offenders who had their names removed from the register 
since the law was passed in September last year.

Nearly half of those who applied were successful, at rate of nearly four a week.

Those whose names have been removed from the list were once placed on it for life, but now no longer now no longer need to tell the police where they are
 living, or if they move near a school or young family.

It comes following a human rights ruling last year, which decided offenders who have been 
monitored by officers for 15 years are now free to apply to have their 
details taken off the register.

Peter Saunders, chief executive of the National Association for People Abused in Childhood said: 'It's downright dangerous that so many sex offenders are effectively able to remove themselves from the Register.

Mr Saunders, who was abused as a child abuse himself, said: 'The victims and survivors of sexual abuse suffer a life sentence at the hands of these people, coping with the miserable consequences.

'It seems inordinately unfair that so many could be removed from something which simply keeps them on the police radar.

'I can't think of anyone who would challenge that apart from the perpetrators themselves.

'Everything we know about sex offenders leads us to believe firmly that they will probably always be a threat to children and to others.'

In London, the Metropolitan Police struck 19 offenders from the register, 17 of whom were convicted rapists.

South Yorkshire Police removed 12 convicts, Greater Manchester Police deleted 10 and Cambridgeshire Constabulary took six off the register, including one who was convicted on seven  counts of indecent assault on a male under 16.

In Suffolk someone convicted of incest was allowed off the register.

West Yorkshire Police rejected the application saying they did not consider the 71-year-old to be safe and wanted him to remain under supervision.

But District Judge Christopher Darnton overturned the ruling, saying he couldn't see any benefit in St Angell staying on the register.

Judge Darnton said: 'The order has now served its purpose. I cannot see any benefit in it remaining."Assistant Chief Constable Michelle Skeer, of the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO), said:'It is recognised that the legislation under the Sexual Offences Act 2003 and the multi-agency public protection arrangements provide some of the most effective tools in the world to manage registered sex offenders.

'Protecting the public from harm is a fundamental role for the police service but we recognise that this must be balanced with the rights of individuals, as highlighted by the Supreme Court judgement.

'We have worked closely with the Home Office and other key partners to develop a robust review process that ensures a full assessment of the risks posed before an offender is removed from the notification requirements. 

'The reality is that the risks posed by some offenders can never be completely eliminated, but we will continue to do all in our power to keep them to a minimum and believe that the proposed review process strikes the right balance between individual rights and public safety.'
