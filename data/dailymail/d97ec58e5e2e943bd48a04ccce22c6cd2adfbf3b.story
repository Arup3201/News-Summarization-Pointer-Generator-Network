A Labour MP who accused former Home Secretary Leon Brittan of ‘improper conduct with children’ was last night defended by a colleague.

Jim Hood used a Commons debate on the 1984/5 miners’ strike on Tuesday to suggest that those who took part in the industrial action will not be ‘surprised’ by the allegations against Lord Brittan.

The remarks – protected from slander and contempt of court laws by parliamentary privilege – were branded ‘disgusting’ by business minister Matthew Hancock.

Lord Brittan, left, home secretary under Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s, was accused of child abuse in a Commons debate by Labour MP Jim Hood, right 

But Simon Danczuk, a campaigner against VIP child abuse, said Mr Hood was right to speak out.

The Labour MP for Rochdale added: ‘He has the right to use parliamentary privilege like any other MP.’

Mr Danczuk helped expose the extent of child abuse perpetrated by former Liberal MP Cyril Smith in a book earlier this year.

Rochdale MP Simon Danczuk, a campaigner against child abuse has backed Mr Hood saying he was right to speak out 

Mr Hood’s remarks came amid calls for the head of the official inquiry into historic child sex abuse to resign over links to Lord Brittan.

Fiona Woolf has admitted attending dinner parties with the Tory politician, who was in charge of the Home Office in the 1980s.

It has been claimed Lord Brittan was handed a file – which is now missing – in 1983 allegedly detailing child abuse at the highest levels of Westminster which he failed to act on. 

Conservative business minister Matthew Hancock, who branded the remarks by Mr Hood as disgusting 

The Peer has strongly denied the claims. Until now, he has not been publicly accused of having played a part in any abuse.

The controversial remarks were made during a debate in which MPs accepted a motion which said Margaret Thatcher’s government ‘misled the public’ about pit closure plans during the miners’ strike.

Mr Hood, who had been discussing violence on picket lines, said: ‘By the way, the current expose of Sir Leon Brittan, the then home secretary, with accusations of improper conduct with children will not come as a surprise to striking miners of 1984.'
