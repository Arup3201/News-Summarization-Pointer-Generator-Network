Kyle Walker is relishing his battle with Nathaniel Clyne for the right to be called England's first-choice right-back.

The Tottenham defender will make his long-awaited return to action following a nine month spell on the sidelines with an abdominal injury against Besiktas on Thursday night.

In Walker's absence, Southampton's Clyne has made his international debut and impressed on his first two appearances under Roy Hodgson.

Many view Clyne as England's new No.1 right-back - and Walker insists he is up to the task of overtaking the Saints defender in Hodgson's thoughts.

'I’ve been in this position before. When I came in for England there were Micah Richards and Glen Johnson in front of me,' said the Spurs defender.

'Now obviously with my injury and Glen not really getting into the team, Nathaniel has come in and done really well.

'I think there is such tough competition in the England team, not just at right-back but for all the positions.

'But I relish the opportunity to compete against the best in my position. That will only make me better as a player.'

He added: 'Missing the World Cup through injury was most definitely a low point for me.

'That was probably made worst by the fact I didn’t make it back in time for the start of the season which everybody thought I would do.

'That was a big low, but you have to move on. I’ve got a wise old head on my shoulders now.

'I want to dig deep and start playing games and winning trophies now.'
