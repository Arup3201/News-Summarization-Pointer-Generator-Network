The owners of a village pub called the Prince of Wales in Essex were shocked to be sent a gas bill for £1,800 addressed to 'HRH Prince Charles' - even though they don't have gas.

Terry Gaskin, 57, who has run the pub in Broxted near Stansted Airport with his partner for three years, initially thought the letter from British Gas was  a prank and put it to one side.

He explained that it was only after reading it a second time that he grew concerned as the notice indicated that someone at his address had accumulated a debt of £1,773.30.

'It came on Saturday and I thought it was a joke at first,' he told MailOnline. 'But then I looked at it again. It's all official and I thought that's not a joke.

'The letter is very polite, but what was worrying was this amount of debt was being sent to my postal address and they said they had tried to contact a number of times.

'But the most surprising part of all is that there is no gas in the village at all. We don't run off gas and never have done.' 

The letter from Tracey Swenne, head of business debt operations with British Gas, said : 'Your Royal Highness. Important information about your account.

The letter to 'HRH The Prince of Wales' landed on the doormat of the Prince of Wales pub on Saturday

'We contacted you a number of times to tell you about the debt owing on your account and to agree payment.

'Unfortunately the debt has still not been paid.'

It adds that the debt on the account is still outstanding and had now been transferred to a debt recovery company, called the PRA Group. 

Mr Gaskin said he has not heard from British Gas or the debt recovery firm since receiving the letter. 

'We were busy hosting a group of Morris dancers yesterday so I didn't get the chance to call, but I am expecting them to get in touch today,' he said. 

A British Gas spokesman said: 'His Royal Highness can rest assured that he was not the intended recipient of this letter.

'We're looking into how the error occurred so that it can be resolved.' 

The Prince of Wales, who lives at Clarence House in London, generates his primary source of income from the Duchy of Cornwall, which owns 133,658 acres of land.

British Gas has since confirmed that the letter sent to the owner's of the Prince of Wales pub (pictured) was not intended for Prince Charles and will be looking into how the error has occurred
