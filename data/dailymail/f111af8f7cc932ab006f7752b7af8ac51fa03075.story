The title deed to Buckingham Palace is to go on show as part of a new exhibition at Windsor Castle.

Documents from the Royal Family’s private archive have been brought out of storage – some for the first time – to mark the centenary of the archives being housed in the castle’s Round Tower.

A title deed dated April 20, 1763, and 
bearing King George III’s wax seal records the purchase of ‘Buckingham 
House’ from Sir Charles Sheffield for the sum of £28,000 – £2 million in
 today’s money.

The property was bought by the monarch for his wife, Queen Charlotte, to accommodate the pair's growing family — 14 of their 15 children were born there.

The house was later remodelled, and became an official residence for Britain's monarchs in 1837.

The exhibition also includes a 100th birthday card from the Queen to Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother and a letter from Prince Albert to Queen Victoria, written during their engagement.

More than 100 documents from the archives will be published in a new book, Treasures From The Royal Archives, and 25 of the items go on display at the Castle tomorrow.

Among the collection are the official papers relating to the sale of Buckingham Palace – which has been used as the official London residence of Britain’s sovereigns since 1837.

Some of George III's personal reflections on the loss of the American colonies are also included in the release, although they are published in book form and will not be shown at the exhibition.

'America is lost!' he wrote following the War of Independence in 1783, and expressed the hope that 'we shall reap more advantages from their trade as friends than ever we could derive from them as Colonies.'

Other exhibits give a glimpse of what monarchs were like as children, long before they came to the throne.

One showed what the Queen  — as 11-year-old Princess Elizabeth — wrote down after her parents' coronation in 1937 in Westminster Abbey.

'I thought it all very, very wonderful and I expect the Abbey did, too. The arches and beams at the top were covered with a sort of haze of wonder as Papa was crowned, at least I thought so,' she wrote.

'At the end the service got rather boring as it was all prayers,' she added.

The exhibition runs from Saturday to January 25 at Windsor Castle.
