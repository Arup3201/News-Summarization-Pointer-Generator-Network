Rolf Harris has been axed by cruise giants Cunard after being charged with child sex offences.

The former TV host and artist was one of several painters whose work was displayed in galleries on board the firm’s luxury liners, including the £300 million flagship Queen Mary 2.

He also travelled on board the QM2 from Southampton to New York last November to host master classes.

The luxury cruise ship giants refused to reveal how many of the former TV presenter's portraits were on display throughout the ships

A Cunard spokesman said: ‘When allegations regarding Rolf Harris first came to light some time ago, we felt it was appropriate to remove his pictures from display in the art galleries on board.’

Cunard refused to say how many of the 83-year-old’s portraits were on show across its three liners.

Harris’s agent did not return calls and emails.

The artist and TV presenter's portrait of the Queen on her 80th birthday, which was commissioned by the BBC, has also disappeared.

The portrait, for which Her Majesty posed in person, hung in the Queen’s Gallery, attached to the south-west wing of the Palace, until 2007 when it was loaned to the Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool for several years.

Harris painted a portrait for the Queen on her 80th birthday which has gone missing since he was charged with indecently assaulting two under-age girls in the 1980s

The painting left the gallery in August last year and has been unaccounted for ever since.

Harris is among several television personalities who have been questioned by Operation Yewtree detectives in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal.

Harris was charged with nine counts of indecent assault and four of making indecent images of children in August.

He has not commented on the charges.
