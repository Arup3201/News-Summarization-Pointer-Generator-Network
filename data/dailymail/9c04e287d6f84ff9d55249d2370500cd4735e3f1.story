New claims: The officer who arrested Justin Bieber has experienced significant disciplinary proceedings over the course of the past 11-years

The Miami Beach police officer who arrested Justin Bieber last month for drag racing has been accused of misconduct 15-times in the past, it has been revealed today.

Officer Steven Cosner, who claims that Bieber, 19, was racing at 60 mph long the beach strip last month, has a checkered history that the popstar's lawyers hope will help their clients case should it go to trial.

Indeed, Bieber's legal counsel are now working under the assumption that Cosner's claims may even be false - as indicated by claims that the GPS tracking system from the star's Lamborghini shows that in the middle of the alleged race, the maximum top speed of the cars was 27 mph.

According to celebrity gossip site, TMZ, Cosner has been investigated by internal affairs repeatedly and has been cited for misconduct 15 times from 2001 to 2012.

Out of the 15 times he was accused of misconduct, Cosner failed to show up for court hearings 5 times.

And in each of those cases he was reprimanded, with three verbal warnings and two write ups.

In 2006, Cosner committed three offenses, which violated the rules of 'courtesy and respect', 'off-duty/secondary employment' and 'unlawful compensation.'

He was suspended for these violations.

And in 2007, Cosner was accused of offensive conduct and language and this allegation is still open according to TMZ.

And, embarrassingly, in 2011, Cosner was cited for sleeping while on duty. And out of the seven remaining cases, Cosner was exonerated by Internal Affairs.

Last month, according to  TMZ.com, who claim to have obtained the print-out of the GPS records from the Lamborghini Bieber had rented and was driving at the time of his arrest in Miami last week, the records would have shown a higher driving speed if the 19-year-old had been drag racing his friend Khalil, as police initially claimed.

Miami Beach police primarily accused Bieber and Khalil of racing at speeds of between 50 and 60 miles an hour.

However, judging by the TMZ print-out, the maximum speed reached by Bieber in the car was 44mph, which was when he left Club Set in Miami Beach at 4.07am, before the speed dropped to a maximum speed of 27mph just two minutes later.

The website claim that the significance behind the figures is that the 27mph reading came on the 3700 block of Pine Tree Drive - where the speed limit is 30mph - and that if Bieber had been drag racing at that point, the reading would have been significantly higher.

Police had originally claimed they caught sight of the drag race on the 2600 block of the road, before Bieber was pulled over and arrested in the 4100 block.

There are also discrepancies in the GPS reading from the Escalade which was reported to have been used to block traffic on Pine Tree Drive to allow the drag race to take place.

However, the print-out of the GPS show that the vehicle originally stopped outside the club at 2.35am, when Bieber and his dad, who was in the Escalade, headed inside and remained for 1.2 hours.

The vehicle isn't registered to have begun moving again until 4.06am, and didn't stop until Bieber was pulled over - dismissing claims that it was used to facilitate the race.

TMZ claim that if the GPS records are correct, the figures will cause issues for prosecutors in the case, as it will mean that Bieber's car was pulled over for a reason that doesn't actually exist.

Regardless of the GPS records, official toxicology reports from Bieber's arrest show that the singer had marijuana and the active ingredient of Xanax in his system when he was arrested on January 23rd.

The star is pleading not guilty to DUI after the arrest.

Meanwhile, in the latest alleged criminal episode earlier this week, Justin and five of his entourage are accused of assaulting a limousine driver on December 30 after they were picked up from a nightclub.

Toronto police released a statement saying the limo driver and an unnamed passenger had an altercation during which he was hit on the back of the head 'several times'.

The charge is yet another in a string of recent run-ins with the law, but if Bieber is convicted of assault, federal law allows that the Canadian could very well be deported and banned from working in the United States.

Meanwhile, former Bee Gees star Barry Gibb is the latest person to offer Bieber some advice in the wake of his difficult few weeks.

Speaking to Matt Lauren on the Today Show, Barry said: 'Things don't really change much, do they? If you're a teenage idol and all the young girls love you, you can lose that pretty quick.

'You can lose perspective, but you can also lose them in the long run if you're not a role model. Hopefully, what he does on stage and the way he dances and the way he sings, he will apply that to his real life.

'There's a discipline in what he's doing. Apply that discipline to how you want to behave.'
