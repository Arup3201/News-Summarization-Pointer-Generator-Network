We've all sat in our armchairs or in the pub listening to pundits give their supposedly expert opinion on the day's football and thought 'I could do better than that.'

But these days it seems you need to be an ex-player to make your voice heard on the television or radio - upon retirement, they're pretty much whisked out of their boots and sat straight in front of a camera or microphone.

Jeff Stelling, the man who brings joys and despair to millions in equal measure each weekend as the host of Sky Sports' Soccer Saturday, is the glorious exception to this punditry rule.

Stelling is not an ex-pro, he's a fan and a student of the game. His career is built on and continues to be fuelled by an obsession with football's minutiae - searching out that elusive statistic that leaves the viewer astounded.

On the face of it, following a rolling list of football results should not be appointment viewing. Indeed, even for the most ardent football fan, it should be something of a turn off. After all, most of us truly care about only one team - our team.

But for over two decades now, Stelling has illuminated every Saturday afternoon from August until May with his rare mix of warmth, charm, passion and inexhaustible knowledge.

There simply isn’t anyone better to front the Carlsberg Fan Squad’s nationwide search to find The People’s Pundit, a competition that will end with one armchair fan given their big break on the talkSPORT radio station.

And of course Stelling, taking time out from his busy schedule of research and recording, is only too happy to pass on a few tips to the hopefuls.

Stelling, 59, has been presenting Sky's Soccer Saturday programme every week for over two decades

‘I was about six when I was taken to my first game - Hartlepool of course, against Workington,’ he says. ‘I think they won 2-0 and I thought it was glorious. Then they didn’t win for the next 20 or so games I went to.

‘But by that point I was hooked. I read everything I could get my hands on - newspaper, books, programmes. In this job, I have spent hours searching for those elusive stats.

‘I used to get all the local newspapers delivered to my house and, when the kids were younger, would even have to escape for a few hours to Winchester Services on the M3 to prep for the show.’

Most of the copious notes Stelling makes - and he does 90 per cent of the show’s stats - are never used but, as we’ve seen week-in, week-out for years now, when that obscure third division left-back does finally break his goal duck after 146 attempts, we will definitely know about it first.

The beauty of Soccer Saturday is that every team is treated with equal importance when Stelling is treating us to the fruits of his week buried away amid the record books.

This comes perhaps from his love for perennial-underachievers Hartlepool - 92nd of the 92 League clubs as we speak - and the circuitous route through local newspapers and radio stations that delivered Stelling to where he is today.

As well as Soccer Saturday, the 59-year-old fronts Sky’s Champions League coverage and was  the host of Channel 4’s iconic Countdown show between 2008 and 2011.

But however glamorous the gig, the one constant over the years has been his insatiable passion for the greatest sport.

‘Many pundits these days are ex-pros of course and I might not be able to tell you what’s going on inside the dressing room,’ he says.

‘But if you just have that passion and knowledge for the game, you can be just as insightful.’

'If Carlsberg did pundits…. They'd probably be fans like you. The Carlsberg Fan Squad and talkSPORT have joined forces to give one fan their big break on national radio.
