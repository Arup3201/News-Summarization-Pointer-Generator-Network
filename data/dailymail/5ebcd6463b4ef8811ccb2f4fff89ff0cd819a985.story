Police have warned of the danger of posting 'gun selfies', after noticing an influx of photographs on showing firearm owners with their rifles on social media sites.

Concerns arose when officers from the Victorian Police force spotted photos which had identifying markers, such as licence plates, work logos, or house windows which may aid criminals in targeting homes with guns.

The warning comes after a Mexican man died in July while attempting to take a selfie with a loaded gun, and the trend of gun selfies known as  'Hernandezing', for the former US football player whose 'gun selfie' was released showing him holding a firearm allegedly used in a murder.

Senior Sergeant Andrew Armstrong from the Victoria Police Licensing and Regulation Division labelled the trend 'reckless' and said that gun owners needed to be aware of the consequences of posting photos with their guns.

'This behaviour is concerning. Some criminals trawl social media networks looking for easy targets and items of interest – including ammunition and other weaponry,' Senior Sergeant Armstrong said.

'It’s easy enough to gather personal information through public profiles or unsecure accounts,' he said.

'Licence holders need to be responsible. Any public display of firearm ownership including stickers on vehicles or house windows can encourage unwanted attention from thieves.'

The spate of 'gun selfies' has also spread throughout the US, picking up interest on social media sites after former New England Patriots star Aaron Hernandez posted a selfie with his handgun.

Hernandez was charged with murder just before the image was released, showing him touting a Glock .45, the gun the prosecution believed to be the murder weapon, reported Huffington Post. 

The image prompted a spate of copycat images, with people posting similar selfies holding guns, uploaded with the hastag 'Hernandezing'.

In July this year, a Mexican man accidentally shot himself while attempting to take a selfie with his gun, dying later from the bullet which went through his forehead.

Oscar Otero Aguilar, 21, from Mexico City, was holding a loaded gun he had borrowed while trying to take a photo, when the gun went off, reported Business Insider. 

When Parliament House in Canberra introduced sentries with machine guns, tourists flocked to take selfies with the guards, prompting commentary on the fascination with guns.

Police are also concerned with the way gun owners store their firearms, with Sergeant Armstrong pointing out that the offense is a regular occurrence in the state.

'Some licence holders are becoming too complacent,' he said.

'With the responsibility of owning a firearm comes the responsibility of storing one. If your firearms can be easily accessed you need to improve your security.'

'Penalties range from around $8000 or 12 months imprisonment to $35,000 or four years imprisonment depending on the category of firearm.' 

Victorian Police are reminding gun owners to take extra precautions over the festive season, especially if owners are planning on going away on holiday.

'We know that the majority of licence holders comply with storage conditions however, there are still a significant number who don’t,' said Sergeant Armstrong.

'There’s a simple solution to this problem – better storage, security and common sense. We want to promote a safer Victoria and ensure firearms don’t fall into the wrong hands.'
