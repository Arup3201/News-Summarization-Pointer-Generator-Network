A bride-to-be discovered her fiance was killed in a car crash as she was celebrating her hen night.

Dawn Gordon was due to marry Bryan Whyte, 34, the father of her four children, next month but found out about the tragedy on Friday night at her party in Inverness, Scotland.

Miss Gordon, of Spean Bridge, heard there had been a crash on the A82 close to her home and called her husband. He did not answer.

She said: 'Bryan always answered his phone so when he didn’t answer I knew it was him.'

Mr Whyte, an HGV mechanic, had been selected to play darts for the Scottish squad just four days before he died

A Police Scotland spokesman said Mr Whyte received serious injuries after a crash between his car and a van.

Miss Gordon told the Daily Record: 'He kept me safe. He looked after me all the time and he was a brilliant father. I’m going to miss him so much.'

The couple had been together for 13 years and were parents to Cameron, 11, Tyler, nine, Innes, seven, and Katlyn, three.

Mr Whyte regularly travelled to darts tournaments and clinched the Western Isles Open championship less than four weeks ago. He has won the islands’ top title in previous years.

He was also the current holder of the Buckie Open and has played competitions in Wales, Germany and the Isle of Man.

Jim MacNeil of the Highland Darts Association said in a statement online: 'Highland Darts and Scotland at large have lost a true gentleman this week in tragic circumstances.

'Bryan Whyte was a true great in our game and a gentleman and great friend to all who met him.

'In all the teams that Bryan played for his humour, honesty and integrity shone through and he endeared himself to everyone he met.

'He has been taken from us far too early but will always remain in our hearts. We will never forget him.'

Police said the driver of the Ford 
Transit van was taken to Belford Hospital in Fort William, but 
is not thought to be seriously injured.

Police are appealing for any witnesses to the collision to contact them on 101. A report is being sent to the Procurator Fiscal.
