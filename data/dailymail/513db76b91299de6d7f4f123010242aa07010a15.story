Bridget Kelly, a former deputy chief of staff to New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie who was fired in disgrace over allegedly politically motivated traffic lane closures, says through her lawyer that she will not obey a subpoena for documents related to the embarrassing episode.

Kelly has become the third New Jersey official to claim the protections of the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which protects citizens from being forced to incriminate themselves in legal proceedings.

Her lawyer wrote Monday to the legislative panel handling an investigation in the state capital of Trenton that Kelly is clinging to her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, and to privacy rights enshrined in the Fourth Amendment.

She 'respectfully will not produce the
 information demanded in the Committee's subpoena,' attorney Michael 
Critchley wrote to Reid Schar, the special counsel in charge of the 
probe.

Schar made his 
name prosecuting former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich, who is serving a 
14-year federal prison term for public corruption.

'The Fifth Amendment's protections are not limited to verbal testimony,' Critchley insisted in the letter published online by the Newark Star-Ledger. He also claimed some of the committee's subpoena demands were 'impermissibly overbroad' and might violate her right to privacy.

The attorney did not respond Tuesday to a request for comment.

Emails that surfaced in January 
appeared to show Kelly orchestrating the closure of lanes leading from 
Fort Lee, N.J. to the busy George Washington Bridge, a commuter route 
into New York City.

'Time 
for traffic problems in Fort Lee,' she wrote to Port Authority official 
David Wildstein, who responded, 'Got it.' Wildstein was the first 
official in the saga to cite the Fifth Amendment, refusing to testify in
 a January 9 hearing.

Wildstein's attorney wrote Friday that his client claimed 'evidence exists' showing Christie was inside the circle of people who knew about the lane closures when they were occurring.

The governor's office fired back with emails, circulated among friends and political allies, claiming 'David Wildstein will do and say anything to save David Wildstein,' and slamming The New York Times for first misreporting what Wildstein's lawyer wrote.

The attorney, the Times' original story incorrectly claimed, had said 'that the governor knew about the lane closings when they were happening, and that he had the evidence to prove it.'

That text was quietly changed hours later without any acknowledgement.

The New Jersey legislature's Select Committee on Investigation said Monday in a statement that it had begun to receive subpoenaed documents from some of the 18 people and two organizations that received the demands last month.

David Wildstein, a former Port Authority appointee of the governor's, refused to testify during a January 9 hearing in Trenton, N.J.

Bill Stepien, the political brain behind Christie's two successful gubernatorial elections, also refused on Friday to turn over documents, citing the Fifth Amendment.

Kelly's decision hit the Internet while Gov. Christie was fielding questions during a regular 'Ask the Governor' radio segment.

'It doesn’t tell me anything,' he said about the decisions, three in all, to withhold information from investigators.

Chris Christie fielded questions from New Jerseyans on Monday night during a regular radio segment as news broke that Kelly would refuse to cooperate with a subpoena

'I would hope they would share any information they have that would let me get to the bottom of it,' Christie said, while continuing to insist he had no knowledge of the 'Bridgegate' lane closures before they were put into place.

'But on the other hand, they have constitutional rights like everybody else, and have the right to exercise them. There’s nothing I can do about that.'

Loretta Weinberg, a Democratic state senator who co-chairs the committee investigating Christie's political orbit, told the Bergen County Record that 'It's frustrating when we’re trying to find the truth of the situation that started with the governor saying he was going to cooperate and urge others to do the same.'

She and State Assemblyman John Wisniewski, the committee's other co-chair, said in a statement that they received Critchley's letter. 'We are reviewing it and considering our legal options with respect to enforcing the subpoena,' they said.

Kelly’s announcement came just days after one of her former underlings, Christina Genovese Renna, resigned from Christie's office. Renna, the former director of New Jersey's Intergovernmental Affairs agency, left her job on Friday but said in a statement that she had been considering the move since shortly after Christie won re-election in November.

Her lawyer said Monday that Renna, who received one of the committee's 20 subpoenas, would find it more and more difficult to leave as parallel investigations by the legislative committee and federal prosecutors gather steam.
