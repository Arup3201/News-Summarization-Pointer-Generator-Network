A 46-year-old woman has been shot dead in the street today, allegedly by her estranged husband who then turned the gun on himself.

Armed officers found the pair bleeding heavily after being called to Willenhall Street in Newport, South Wales, at 8.45 this morning, Gwent Police said.

Witnesses said a red car pulled up, the gunman, 49, got out, fired at his former partner, said to be a mother, from less than 10ft and then shot himself.

The first man on the scene of the Newport shooting told how the victim had been hit in the chest and the gunman then 'blew half his face off'.

The woman may have been hit twice and 15 seconds later the assailant then shot himself once.

They were both taken to the city’s Royal Gwent Hospital with serious injures. The woman was pronounced dead at around 1pm.

A doctor from a nearby GP surgery had risked his own life by running out to help the pair.

Witnesses also said her new boyfriend was one of the first on the scene and was taken away by police.

Probe: Police were told by witnesses that three shots were fired in total, two at the woman and one by the gunman on himself

Dog walker Sam Williams, 33, raised the alarm after hearing a shotgun being fired three times.He said: 'The man had shot her before turning the gun on himself.

'He hadn't done a very good job of it - half his face was missing. But he was still conscious and moaning.

'He
is a big man with a crew cut and there was a single barrelled shot gun 
lying next to him and I could see spent cartridges on the floor.

'I could see an entry wound in her chest. I shouted to her but she didn't respond.

'She was gone, her eyes were rolled back into her head.

'I just stayed with them until the police arrived.

'I have seen them both driving around. She was an attractive woman in her mid-30s.

'Both their cars were parked on the side of the road, they had their boots open but I'm not sure why.

'It looked like he took a step back onto the grassy verge before he let her have it.'

Officers have confirmed the gunman and his victim were 'known to each other' as both were taken to hospital with serious injuries.

'The gunman was the woman's estranged husband - he just turned up and shot her in the street,' a neighbour said.

'She had a new boyfriend who has been down to the scene this morning.

'He went up to the police cordon, told them who he was and asked what's happened.

'Then the police took him away. The woman was laying in a pool of blood in the street for a while - she had been shot twice from close range so you can imagine how serious her injuries were.

'A doctor came out of the surgery - he was checking their pulses and trying to talk to them.' 

Factory manager Ian Fricker, 37, said: 'I was in my office when I heard two loud bangs.

'I thought straightaway they sounded like a shotgun going off.

'It was quiet for a moment then I heard a third shot. After that there were loads of sirens.'

Criminology student Phil Passey, 30, said: 'It is the sort of thing you expect in New York, not in Newport'.

Kelly Williams, 25, who lives yards from the scene of the tragedy, said: 'I've only just moved here and now I feel frightened and at risk.

'I walk past the spot where it happened every day and now I fear for my own safety.'

Neighbour Mohammed Miah had been to the local mosque and came home to find his house was cordoned off.

He said: 'I wasn't able to get inside to see my wife to make sure she was alright.'

A Gwent Police spokesman said: 'Armed police attended and found and male and female injured.

'Both were taken to the Royal Gwent Hospital with serious injuries.

'It's not believed anyone else was involved in the incident - both of those involved were known to each other.

'Officers have recovered the firearm from the scene and we are currently locating family members.'
