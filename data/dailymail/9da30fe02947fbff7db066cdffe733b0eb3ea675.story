The family of a Texas teenager sentenced to probation after killing four people in a drunken-driving wreck will pay for just a fraction of his court-ordered treatment, a court official testified Friday.

Ethan Couch's parents will be charged $1,170 a month for his treatment at the North Texas State Hospital in rural Vernon. That amount would cover less than two days of treatment, which costs $715 a day, the Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported.

Couch's case drew national attention due in large part to his defense's argument that his wealthy parents had coddled him into a sense of irresponsibility - a condition that a defense expert called 'affluenza.'

'Affluenza': Ethan Couch killed four people last year when he crashed into the back of a disabled vehicle while he was driving drunk

Couch, 17, killed four people last year when his vehicle rammed into a crowd of people trying to help the driver of a disabled vehicle south of Fort Worth. Investigators said he was driving his family company's pickup truck while drunk and with traces of Valium in his system.

Couch admitted to causing the wreck and received 10 years' probation from State District Judge Jean Boyd rather than prison time, as prosecutors and Couch's victims wanted. Several of his victims have since sued the Couch family, with most of them reaching confidential settlements.

Debbie Spoonts, placement supervisor for Tarrant County Juvenile Services, said the facility decided what Fred and Tonya Couch would pay based on a sliding scale.

A message from The Associated Press 
seeking comment from Spoonts on the facility's payment policy was not 
immediately returned Friday.

The
 teen's family previously had offered to pay for Couch to go to a 
$450,000-a-year rehabilitation center near Newport Beach, Calif. Boyd 
rejected that request.

Ethan Couch's attorney, Reagan Wynn, and Fred and Tonya Couch did not speak to the media after the hearing.

Lance
 Evans, the attorney for Couch's parents, said after the hearing that 
the family 'respects the decision of the facility and of the court, and 
will honor the payment system that the court has put in place.'

Kevin
 McConnell, the father of a child who was injured in the wreck, declined
 to comment after the hearing on whether the amount the Couches will pay
 is fair.

'That's not my call,' McConnell said. 'We have a criminal justice system and a legal system. That's not my call to make.'

McConnell's family is suing the Couches. He said they will not accept a settlement and instead want a jury trial.

Killed: Hollie Boyles, 52, and her daughter, Shelby Boyles, 21, were helping out the driver of a broken down SUV when they were struck and killed by Couch's out-of-control pickup

Victims: Breanna Mitchell,  and Brian Jennings, 41, were both killed in the horrific crash

Mr & Mrs Couch have paid undisclosed sums to the families of three who died.

Pastor
 Jennings and Hollie Boyles had pulled over separately at the side of a 
Burleson, Texas road on June 15 to help Breanna Mitchell whose tire had 
blown out.

Couch was 
speeding at around 70mph and he hit the group – killing all three and 
Mrs Boyles’s daughter Shelby who was with her at the time.

He
 also seriously injured two of his friends who were sitting in the back 
of the lorrythat he was driving at the time of the crash. Sergio Lemuus 
who was left paralysed after the accident.

It
 was revealed during the trial that Couch's blood-alcohol level was 0.24
 – three times the adult limit, though minors aren't allowed any alcohol
 in their system – and that he was also on the prescription drug Valium.

The
 case spurred calls for potential changes. Texas Lieutenant Governor 
David Dewhurst, has asked for a study of sentencing guidelines in 
intoxication manslaughter cases.
