Andy Carroll is currently away training with West Ham in France and he cannot return soon enough for girlfriend Billi Mucklow's liking.

The TOWIE star went on Instagram to declare just how much she is missing her Geordie boyfriend.

However, she will not have to wait 
too long before she is reunited with Carroll as Sam Allardyce's side return to London before the end of the week.

Carroll could be involved in West Ham's friendly encounter against League Two side Stevenage at Broadhall Way on Saturday before the next trip of their pre-season tour takes the Hammers to the other side of the world.

Mucklow will have to get used to Carroll being away from her again as the Hammers travel to New Zealand and Germany during the latter stages of West Ham's pre-season schedule.

West Ham are due to play Wellington Phoenix and Sydney on July 23 and 26 respectively before taking part in the Schalke 04 Cup at the beginning of August.
