Tireless: Doreen Lawrence

The mother of murdered teenager Stephen Lawrence was honoured for her relentless pursuit of justice and her campaign against  racism yesterday.

Doreen Lawrence was presented with the Londoner of the Year Award by the Daily Mail’s Editor, Paul Dacre, at the London Press Club Awards.

Stephen was 18 when he was stabbed to death by five white youths at a bus stop in Eltham, South East London, in 1993.

Baroness Lawrence fought tirelessly for justice for her son and, in January 2012, Gary Dobson and David Norris were finally convicted of the murder.

At the awards, the London Evening Standard won Daily Newspaper of the Year and The Mail on Sunday won Sunday Newspaper of the Year.

One of the special honours of the day, the John Lewis-sponsored Edgar Wallace award for writing of the highest quality, went to Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday contributor Ian Birrell.The Daily Mail was praised by judges for its ‘constantly expanding roster of star  columnists’, a history of  ‘successful campaigning’ and its ‘juggernaut website’.

At the awards, held at The Stationers and Newspaper Makers’ Hall, in central London, Mr Dacre said: ‘It is bitter sweet that the recipient of this award needs no introduction.

‘Who has not heard of Doreen Lawrence and her fight for justice for her son Stephen – brutally and senselessly murdered in a case that brought shame on  London for more than 20 years.

‘I and the Mail team are proud of our own efforts to help achieve justice for Stephen. Two of the thugs are in jail and the case remains open in relation to others. But throughout that battle Doreen Lawrence has fought for the other Stephens as she calls them.’

Mr Dacre said Lady Lawrence had ‘become a powerful champion against racism’ and been ‘justly recognised’ last year with a seat in the House of Lords.

Baroness Lawrence said it was ‘a privilege’ to accept the award. She thanked the Press for their support over the years, singling out the Daily Mail, which famously published a front page on February 14, 1997, branding five suspects as ‘Murderers’.

She said: ‘I think that without having the Mail publish their faces, no one would know. They could walk around and nobody knew what they looked like.’

The other winners were: Scoop of the Year – Sunday People for Nigella Lawson and Charles Saatchi; Blog of the Year – Paul Staines of Guido Fawkes; Arts Reviewer of the Year – Ludovic Hunter-Tilney (Financial Times); Business Journalist of the Year – Simon Neville (Independent and Evening Standard); Broadcast Journalist of the Year – LBC Breakfast host Nick Ferrari.
