Indefinitely: University of Georgia star tailback Todd Gurley was suspended from competition indefinitely by the university Thursday pending an investigation into whether he violated NCAA rules

University of Georgia star tailback Todd Gurley was suspended from competition indefinitely by the university Thursday pending an investigation into whether he violated NCAA rules, officials report.

Officials say that the violation involved Gurley receiving 'extra benefits' for memorabilia, autographs, or the 'use of his likeness'. 

In a university press release posted Thursday, school officials failed to give specifics on the alleged violation but said that there is an 'ongoing investigation into an alleged violation of NCAA rules.'

'I'm obviously very disappointed,' UGA head football coach Mark Richt said in the press release. 'The important thing for our team is to turn all our attention toward preparation for Missouri.'

The Heisman Trophy candidate reportedly received $400 to sign 80 items in Athens, Georgia this past spring, Sports Illustrated reports.

ESPN reports that noted autograph authentication company James Spence Authentication has authenticated at least 500 items signed by the UGA junior. This includes jerseys, mini-helmets, photos, baseballs and Nike cleats.

SB Nation posted an alleged email from a 'tipster' saying he has video- and photo-evidence of Gurley doing a private autograph signing. The tipster said he has sold Gurley-signed memorabilia on ebay.

Tweets: Sports experts like Darren Rovell and Bruce Feldman have taken to Twitter to comment on Gurley's alleged NCAA violation

Games: While Gurley's relationship with memorabilia dealers is investigated, the tailback is expected to miss two to three games 

The tipster claimed that Gurley has been paid thousands of dollars, however, the video reportedly fails to show an exchange of money and the photograph does not clearly show Gurley. 

The tipster said in the email: 'I believe this would be the lead story on sports center if ESPN got their hands on this. Hope to hear from you soon.' 

The NCAA prohibits student-athletes from receiving 'extra benefits.' 

The NCAA describes extra benefits as: 'any special arrangement by an institutional employee or a representative of the institution's athletics interests to provide a student-athlete of the student-athlete's relative or friend a benefit that is not expressly authorized by NCAA legislation.'

Paid: Officials say that Gurley received $400 for signing memorabilia on the UGA campus this past spring

ESPN reports that this specific kind of violation is not new to the world of college football.

Other violators have included A.J. Green, who now plays for the Cincinnati Bengals and Johnny Manziel who now plays for the Cleveland Browns.

While Gurley's relationship with memorabilia dealers is investigated, the tailback is expected to miss two to three games, Fox Sports reports. This means that Gurley may miss games being played against the Missouri Tigers, the Arkansas Razorbacks, and, long-time rivals, the Florida Gators. 

ESPN reports that coaches found out Thursday that Gurley would not be permitted to play against Missouri -- the game is scheduled for Saturday. Freshman Nick Chubb is said to be a likely candidate to take Gurley's place in the game against the Missouri Tigers.

Candidate: Gurley has recently been a top candidate for the Heisman Trophy 

NCAA rules: The NCAA prohibits student-athletes from receiving 'extra benefits'

Fox Sports said that Gurley is 'irreplaceable' and credits the player for the success of the team despite its 'mediocre passing game.'

Gurley has 773 yards rushing, is ranked No. 6 in the country, and has eight rushing touchdowns, and is tied for seventh nationally, this season, according to the Tennessean.

Gurley has recently been a top pick for the Heisman Trophy, but Fox Sports reports that, due to the NCAA investigation, his campaign may take a big hit.
