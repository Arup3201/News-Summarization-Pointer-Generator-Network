'Hate crime': Police are investigating 'abusive and threatening' emails sent to Archbishop of York Dr John Sentamu

The Archbishop of York has been sent several ‘abusive and threatening’ racist emails after speaking out against gay marriage.

The malicious messages to Dr John Sentamu have prompted a police investigation, it was revealed yesterday.

In an interview last month, the 
senior Church of England cleric said that marriage must remain a union 
between a man and a woman.

He argued that the Prime Minister 
would be acting like a ‘dictator’ if he allowed homosexuals to wed, 
rather than just have civil partnerships as is the case at present.

Yesterday a spokesman for 
Ugandan-born Dr Sentamu said the Archbishop received a ‘large quantity’ 
of correspondence following the interview, adding: ‘Amongst many 
positive emails that he has received, there have been a small number of 
abusive and threatening emails of a racist nature which North Yorkshire 
Police are investigating as hate crimes.’

In the interview Dr Sentamu said: 
‘Marriage is a relationship between a man and a woman. I don’t think it 
is the role of the state to define what marriage is. It is set in 
tradition and history and you can’t just [change it] overnight, no 
matter how powerful you are.

‘We’ve seen dictators do it in 
different contexts and I don’t want to redefine very clear social 
structures that have been in existence for a long time and then 
overnight the state believes it could go in a particular way.’

The Government will open a consultation on the issue of same-sex marriages next month.

Dr Sentamu said bishops in the House 
of Lords had not tried to stop civil partnership laws introduced by the 
previous Labour government, but predicted widespread opposition to plans
 to legalise gay marriage.

‘The rebellion is going to come not 
only from the bishops,’ he said. ‘You’re going to get it from across the
 benches and in the Commons.

‘If you genuinely would like the 
registration of civil partnerships to happen in a more general way, most
 people will say they can see the drift. But if you begin to call those 
“marriage”, you’re trying to change the English language.

‘That does not mean you diminish, 
condemn, criticise, patronise any same-sex relationships because that is
 not what the debate is about.’

Clergymen have demanded that the Church's Parliament allows priests to hold same-sex ceremonies in churches

Last week, while Dr Sentamu was 
abroad, about 70 protesters staged a demonstration outside York Minster,
 the cathedral where he serves.

They denounced Dr Sentamu’s comments and accused him of homophobia.

The University of York’s Lesbian, Gay,
 Bisexual and Transgender (LGBT) group, which organised the 
demonstration, said Dr Sentamu was opposing equality.

A spokesman for North Yorkshire Police
 said of the emails: ‘We can confirm that a complaint has been received 
from the office of Archbishop John Sentamu, following the receipt of 
emails containing racially offensive statements.

‘The emails are being investigated as a hate crime.’
