Bradley Murdoch, who was convicted for murdering Peter Falconio, has filed an application for leave to appeal

The man convicted of murdering British backpacker Peter Falconio in the Australian outback 12 years ago today launched a dramatic new move to win his freedom.           

Bradley Murdoch, now 55, was sent to jail for life, with a minimum of 28 years, for the murder of Mr Falconio, 29, while he was travelling through central Australia with his British girlfriend Joanne Lees, who was 28 at the time, in 2001.

Murdoch has always insisted on his innocence - and today, through a team of lawyers, he filed an application for leave to appeal in the Criminal Court of Appeal in the Northern Territory.

‘The entire case against him has more holes in it than a Swiss cheese,’ Mr Andrew Fraser, an investigator working with Murdoch's legal team, told the Daily Mail.

Mr Falconio’s body has never been found after Miss Lees told police that she and her boyfriend had been waylaid by a stranger who drove up beside them at night and indicated there was something wrong with their camper van.

She said that when Mr Falconio went to the rear of the vehicle she heard what she thought was a gunshot. The stranger then partially bound her with home-made handcuffs, she said, and bundled her into his four-wheel-drive vehicle.

But she was able to escape and hid in roadside bushes. It was a year before police arrested Murdoch.

But today his legal team said in the appeal papers that the prosecution had made a serious error.

The papers allege that ‘the crown prosecutor in the original trial, Rex Wild QC, improperly groomed the star crown witness, Joanne Lees, in how to give her evidence,’ Murdoch’s barrister, Peter Faris, QC, said in a statement.

‘This allegation brings into question the entirety of Lees’ evidence,’ he said.

It is understood the legal team, who have been examining every minute detail of the case against Murdoch for years, decided to strike after reading comments allegedly made by former prosecutor Mr Wild in an interview with a Sydney newspaper.

In that article, Mr Wild was reported to have said that he considered Miss Lees a risky witness because he could never quite fathom her, not that he ever doubted her.

He was quoted as saying: ‘It was all explained to her: be yourself; let it all hang out; the jury will want to see your raw emotions.

‘But no. Stiff upper-lip. It was not as though she was an upper-class girl - she was middle class. But she was not going to let these people get at her.’

The defence team, the Mail has learned, has gathered a number of witnesses who are ready to challenge scientific evidence brought against Murdoch.

Among the crucial points, should Murdoch win the right to appeal, will be the credibility of DNA evidence and what was found in blood that had pooled on the road where the rear of the couple’s campervan had been parked.

Murdoch’s lawyers are expected to challenge the strength of evidence that stated that it was the outback drifter’s DNA that was found on a T-shirt being worn by Miss Lees on that night of July 14, 2001.

She claimed that Murdoch had struggled violently with her after dragging her from the campervan and had sat on her as he tried to bind her legs together. Yet, Murdoch’s supporters have always asked, why was only a ‘speck’ of DNA found.

What was said to have been Murdoch’s DNA will now also come under scrutiny.

The spreading pool of blood has also come into question by Aboriginal trackers that the Mail spoke to in the days after the dramatic events near the hamlet of Barrow Creek, north of Alice Springs.

After closely examining the blood they said they could not understand why there were no ants crawling on it, insisting they would have moved in on it even though it was winter time in Australia.

The Aborigines said there might have been ‘something in the blood’ that turned ants away, indicating that the pool was not fresh.

At the time of Murdoch’s trial, which saw him convicted in 2005, Miss Lees’ story was questioned by his defence team.

They asked her how she had managed to scramble from the cabin into the rear of the vehicle said to have been driven by Murdoch when the cabin was sealed and the only access to the rear was through the back entrance.

When she told the court that perhaps she had been pushed in through the canvas sides of the four-wheel-drive, it was claimed that could not have been possible because Murdoch had erected a metal grill under the canvas as a deterrent to thieves.
