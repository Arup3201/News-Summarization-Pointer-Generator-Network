When you've had one drink too many, it seems it's a good idea to step away from your Smartphone or laptop - unless you want to end up as the not-so-proud owner of a 'Lionel Rich Tea' mug or vibrating head scratcher.

These are some of the bizarre purchases people have admitted buying when under the influence of alcohol. 

Nearly a fifth of people confessed to online shopping sprees after a few tipples - even though their judgement was impaired.

Hey big spender: Nearly a fifth of people across the UK shop online after a few drinks, spending an average of £70 each time they go online

In a survey 
of people across the UK, 16 per cent of respondents admitted to making 
some bizarre online purchases after a few drinks, with the average 
shopper racking up £70 worth of purchases before putting their credit 
card away.

Despite
 feeling a little freer with our purses, most of those surveyed weren't 
spontaneously buying designer handbags and high heels but heading to 
eBay for random items including carpet beaters, South Park figurines and wine coolers.

Seemed a good idea at the time? One Brit admitted to buying a 'Lionel Rich Tea' mug when drunk, left, another purchased South Park figurines

A vibrating head massager, wine cooler and a pack of toothbrushes were bought by other drunk shoppers

Brits surveyed confessed they had made the following embarrassing buys when under the influence...

However, 
it seems women are still more savvy than men even after couple of 
glasses of wine, being seven per cent less likely to reach for the 
laptop for some late night retail therapy and spending roughly £20 less 
when they do.

Out of the 
2000 people who opened up about their drunken shopping habits, Londoners
 emerged as the worst offenders, with their boozy bargain hunting 
averaging at £134 a session.

Among the top buys was a picture of a petrified wombat by an Australian artist, retailing on eBay for £50.

The research was carried out by Give as You Live, a charitable shopping platform. 

CEO Steff Lewis said: 'We've been analysing online shopping behaviours for years and the purchases made after a tipple or two is really quite revealing.'

Last year the online retail market grew by 16 per cent and UK shoppers spent a whopping £91 billion pounds online, according to the IMRG-Capgemini eRetail Sales Index.
