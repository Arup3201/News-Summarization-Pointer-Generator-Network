A man who was given up for adoption by his single teenage mother at the end of the Second World War has met his sister for the first time.

Christopher Battley, 68, was adopted at birth in 1945 after his mother Margaret Powles, then 16, was unable to care for him on her own.

His absent father was believed to be a Canadian serviceman, based in the UK during wartime.

Mr Battley, who lives in Maitland, Australia, spent years trying to track down his biological family.

After researching his genealogy, he discovered his birth name was Powles.

He said: ‘The most uncanny feeling was finding out my real name.’

He began trawling ancestry websites and eventually his patience paid off – when he came across his family’s profile.

Mr Battley said: ‘I sat down and thought “you’ve got to be joking.”

‘The odds of that happening - I just sat there bewildered, and then I found out how big the family was.’

It turned out Mr Battley had seven siblings in Costessey, Norwich.

Meanwhile their mother had died on January 17, 2012 aged 82.

For a long time Val Latimer, 65, had thought she was the eldest of seven.

But she was amazed to discover she had an older brother.

And this week the siblings met for the first time in Norwich, with Mrs Latimer waving a giantAustralian flag or her brother’s arrival at the train station.

She said: ‘It was a very powerful moment but we just about managed not to cry.’

Since meeting up the siblings have discovered several family traits.

Mrs Latimer said: ‘He’s certainly got the Powles’ sense of humour and we’ve noticed familiar mannerisms.’

Mr Battley said he was overjoyed to find his biological family.

He said: ‘The initial feelings of finding a family, a real family, you can’t ever imagine.

‘It’s very exciting but it will take a while to sink in.’

Mrs Latimer, who is already planning a trip to Australia, added: ’We’ll certainly stay close as a family now after finally finding each other - it’s just been wonderful.’
