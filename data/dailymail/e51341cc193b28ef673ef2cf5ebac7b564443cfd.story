Two people have been killed in protests against the decision to drop charges against the former Egyptian dictator, as demonstrations continued into a second day on university campuses.

Students gathered at Cairo University, waving pictures of Hosni Mubarak behind bars and demanding the 'fall of the regime', the rallying cry of the Arab Spring uprising that overthrew him.

Police stood ready at the gates to bar students that sought to take their demonstration into the streets.

The students were protesting against the decision of an Egyptian court to drop its case against Mubarak over the massacre of hundreds of protesters in the 2011 uprising that ended the 83-year-old's 30-year rule

An Egyptian court yesterday dropped its case against Mubarak over the massacre of hundreds of protesters in the 2011 uprising that ended the 83-year-old's 30-year rule.

Two people were killed and nine were wounded last night,when security forces fired tear gas and birdshot to disperse about 2,000 protesters who attempted to enter Tahrir Square - the symbolic heart of the revolution.

Security forces also closed a Cairo metro station, the state news agency said, an apparent effort to prevent gatherings downtown.

Clashes also erupted at Zagazig University in the Nile Delta, and the state-owned Al-Ahram newspaper said 11 students were detained after setting fire to a building.

A court dismissed the charges nearly four years after the uprising ended the 86-year-old's three-decade rule

Many Egyptians who lived through the rule of former airforce officer Mubarak view it as a period of autocracy and crony capitalism.

His overthrow led to Egypt's first free election. But the winner, Mohamed Mursi, was ousted last year by Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, another military officer who won a presidential vote in May.

Egyptian authorities have since jailed Mursi and thousands of his Muslim Brotherhood supporters, sentencing hundreds to death in mass trials that drew international criticism.

By contrast, Mubarak-era figures have been released and new laws curtailing political freedoms have raised fears among activists that the old leadership is back.

'Down with Hosni Mubarak, down with every Mubarak, down with military rule' said one Facebook page that called for protests against the ruling.

The ruling was seen by activists as the latest sign that the rights won during the revolt are being eroded. The country is now led by a new army-backed president, former military chief Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi.

Yesterday's verdict concludes Mubarak's retrial along with his two sons, his security chief and six top security commanders, who were all acquitted.

Also on trial was businessman Hussein Salem, a longtime Mubarak friend tried in absentia. He too was acquitted.

Mubarak was also acquitted of corruption charges that he faced along with his sons Alaa and Gamal.

It was not immediately clear whether Mubarak would now walk free since he is serving a three-year jail term for corruption charges he was convicted of in May.

He has been in detention since April 2011, but it is unclear if the past three-and-a-half years will be considered as time served.

The charges were related to the killing of hundreds of protesters during the uprising, part of the so-called Arab Spring revolt

Mubarak's successor, the Islamist President Mohammed Morsi is also jailed and faces a series of charges

Mubarak was convicted and sentenced to life in prison in 2012 on charges related to the killing of protesters, but the verdict was overturned on appeal the following year.

Mubarak has spent virtually all the time since he was detained in hospitals due to his poor health.

Yesterday, he was brought to the defendants' cage on a hospital trolley. He wore dark glasses, a navy blue tie and a matching cardigan. 

The trial, however, was concerned only with the killing of 239 protesters, whose names were cited in the charges sheet

Presiding judge Mahmoud al-Rashidi made clear that the dismissal of the charges did not absolve Mubarak of the corruption and 'feebleness' of the latter years

The judge suggested that the ousted leader's old age should have spared him a criminal trial

Nearly 900 protesters were killed in the 18-day uprising that ended when Mubarak stepped down, handing over power to the military.

The trial, however, was concerned only with the killing of 239 protesters, whose names were cited in the charges sheet.

Presiding judge Mahmoud al-Rashidi made clear that the dismissal of the charges did not absolve Mubarak of the corruption and 'feebleness' of the latter years of his 29-year rule and praised the January 2011 uprising, saying that its goals - freedom, bread and social justice - were legitimate.

However, al-Rashidi said Mubarak, like any other human, erred at times and suggested that his old age should have spared him a criminal trial.

'To rule for or against him after he has become old will be left to history and the Judge of Judges, the Righteous and the Justice (God) who will question him about his rule,' said the judge, who threatened to jail anyone attending the 45-minute hearing if they reacted in any way to the ruling before he adjourned the session.
