The show is months from curtain up but there is already heightened drama surrounding one Broadway musical - although it has mostly taken place off stage.

Rebecca, the musical adaptation of the novel by Daphne Du Maurier, is now in jeopardy after a major but secretive investor pulled out in dubious circumstances.

Paul Abrams had promised a staggering $4.5million to lead producer Ben Sprecher to stage the musical at the Broadhurst Theater on Broadway.

However before Mr Abrams, a shadowy character based in Britain, could produce the millions he mysteriously died of malaria, according to his associates last month.

However no obituary has ever appeared and the only person connected to estate to come forward is an equally unknown individual called 'Wexler'. 

It was revealed last week, according to the New York Times, that Mr Sprecher had never even met Abrams.

Mr Sprecher confirmed to the Times 
that his cast would be paid this week but rehearsals delayed until new, 
unnamed investors paid up.

The final curtain? Although Broadway productions are always cloak-and-dagger operations, the financial wrangling behind Rebecca has left many in the theater community stunned

Sprecher, a seasoned off-Broadway producer, had dealt with Abrams only by phone after his leading investor canceled a trip to New York for a face-to-face meeting.

Drama: Ben Sprecher's production of Rebecca has been left with a $4.5million shortfall

After Abram's death, Mr Sprecher flew to London to try and extract money from his investor's estate.

However he never met any representative in person, dealing only with 'Wexler' by email.

The disappearance of such a wealthy investor leaves a huge hole in funding for the $12million musical. 

It also leaves Sprecher's companies liable for millions of dollars to other investors.

Robert E. Wankel, a major Broadway 
player, invested a vast sum 
in Rebecca and owns the Broadhurst Theater where it is intended to be 
staged come November.

He told the Times: 'Broadway does business in its own 
strange way, I’ll grant you.

'But this is the 
strangest bit of show business to come along in a long time.'

On the show's website it states that rehearsals for Rebecca have been postponed due to the 'tragic death of one of Rebecca's key investors'.

However tickets are still be purchased via the website.

Calls to The Sprecher Organization by MailOnline went unanswered.

The musical version of Rebecca opened
in September 2006 in Vienna, Austria where it played for more than three years.

Productions have been staged across Europe and at the Imperial Theater in Tokyo to great successs.

Four years ago, plans began to 
move the entire production to the Broadway stage but complications in 
sets and special effects saw the effort cancelled.

Mr Sprecher's production is due to open on November 18, starring Jill Plaice, Ryan Silverman and Karen Mason in the lead roles.

Ben Sprecher is behind The Sprecher 
Organization which had worked on projects including the theatrical 
adaption of The Exorcist, a new musical called Havana and the stage 
version of Little House On The Prairie.

Rebecca, a gothic mystery, was written by Daphne Du Maurier in 1938 and tells the story of a female protagonist, known only as 'I', who agrees to marry a wealthy English widower, Maxim de Winter, after only knowing him a short time.

When she arrives to set up home at his Manderley Estate, she finds the housekeeper Mrs Danvers devoted to de Winter's last wife Rebecca who died in mysterious circumstances.

Du Maurier adapted her own book for the stage in 1939, leading to a successful London run of more than 350 performances.
