There were more questions than answers for Spain on Thursday night after an unbeaten qualifying run stretching back 36 games across eight years came to an end.

It was not so much the defeat, as the symptoms of malaise that were so apparent at the World Cup and show no signs of lifting.

No one quite knows why Diego Costa can score nine goals in nine matches for Chelsea and yet fail to score in any of his first six games for his adopted country.

No one really understands why the greatest goalkeeper in Spain’s history, Iker Casillas, and as of Thursday night the second most capped European international ever, can no longer be guaranteed to make straightforward saves.

And no-one can fathom why a team that conceded just one goal as it won Euro 2012 now struggles to put together a defence worthy of the name.

Costa’s drought is made all the more baffling by the fact that he has club team-mate Cesc Fabregas alongside him in the national team. The pair linked well against Slovakia but without success.

Some commentators argue that Spain are too narrow to give Costa the service he requires.

Vicente del Bosque’s decision to drop Manchester City’s Jesus Navas was one that puzzled most commentators and with Andres Iniesta and David Silva on the wings – both preferring to come inside with the ball – there is a lack of decent service into the striker from wide areas.

While Costa has failed to score in six, Valencia’s young striker Paco Alcacer has two in two and played instead of Costa when Spain beat Macedonia in their first qualifying match 5-1.

There were calls for him to be kept in the side and when he came on, on Thursday night he scored almost immediately.

No one doubts Costa’s ability. But if Spain are to play the style of football that saw them win three straight tournaments many argue Alcacer’s mobility and ability to link with his midfielders better suits the team’s needs.

In goal Casillas cuts a sad figure. On Thursday he pulled off one brilliant save from Robert Mak but 10 minutes later could be seen fumbling at a free-kick that back in his pomp he would have thrown his proverbial cap on.

He is desperate for the disappointing World Cup not to be his last tournament and there have been signs in recent weeks at Real Madrid that he is getting back to his best.

Here's the view from the Spanish press with AS stating 'Spain Continue from the World Cup. without aim, without luck and a gift from Casillas' whereas Sport highlights Iker Casillas' calamitous performance in goal

But the latest mistake will encourage those who want him out of the side. In David De Gea Del Bosque has an in-form replacement.

But Spain’s defensive problems go deeper than Casillas’ form. There is a serious centre-back shortage not helped by the fact that most top sides in La Liga don’t have a Spanish central defensive partnership.

A lack of homegrown talent has been a typically English problem in the recent past but now Del Bosque, like Roy Hodgson, is scratching his head at a serious shortage of options.

Barcelona have preferred Argentine Javier Mascherano and Frenchman Jeremy Mathieu so far this season, leaving Gerard Pique watching from the bench.

At Real Madrid Sergio Ramos either has a French partner in Raphael Varane or a Portuguese accomplice in Pepe.

And last season’s title-winning campaign at Atletico Madrid was based on a pairing of Uruguayan Diego Godin and Brazilian Miranda.

Such are the changes made by Michel Platini to European Championship qualifiying that there seems little chance Spain will not be in France for the 2016 tournament.

But the questions will need answering in the meantime. Perhaps some of the solutions will be on show on Friday afternoon when the likes of Juventus striker Alvaro Morata, Liverpool full backs Alberto Moreno and Javi Manquillo, former Everton loanee Gerard Deulofeu, and Stoke City defender Marc Muniesa will all be on show for the Under 21s.
