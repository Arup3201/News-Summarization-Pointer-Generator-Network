Juventus have claimed they will not have to pay Chelsea compensation in the Adrian Mutu case after having an appeal upheld by the Court of Arbitration for Sport.

Governing body FIFA ruled in 2013 that Juventus and Livorno had to contribute some of the £14million owed by Mutu to Chelsea for a breach of contract.

The London club released Mutu in 2004 following the Romanian striker's positive drug test and sought compensation, which they were granted by FIFA in 2013.

Mutu joined Juve after being let go by the Blues, with Livorno also involved in the transfer, and both Italian clubs immediately appealed the FIFA ruling.

A statement from Juventus on Wednesday read: 'Juventus Fooball Club announces today that the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Lausanne has notified us of the decision made by the arbitrators in the dispute that pitted Chelsea against Juventus regarding the signing of Adrian Mutu.

'The arbitrators have completely dismissed the demands made by Chelsea FC, ordering them (the London club) to play the legal costs of the case.

'This ruling has no effect on the financial balance of Juventus Football Club because the club, fully aware of being in the right, chose not to allow for any risk in funds over the developing litigation.'

Mutu signed for Juventus in January 2005, but could not immediately join the Italian giants because they had their full quota of non-EU players.

Instead, Serie A club Livorno reached an agreement with Juve to sign the Romanian on a free transfer until Juve could offload one of their non-European players.

Mutu never played for Livorno and made his first appearance for Juve in May of 2005 having served a seven-month ban from football.

He played at Juve until July 2006 when he was sold to Fiorentina for eight million euros.

Mutu, now 36, lost all of his appeals in a legal battle with Chelsea which has lasted more than 10 years.

The former Parma star announced his retirement from football earlier this month having played last season with Romanian club Petrolul Ploiesti.
