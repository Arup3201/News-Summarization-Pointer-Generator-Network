Stanford alumna and Ford model has accused a Silicon Valley executive of raping  her so many times she was left with post-traumatic stress disorder.

Elise Clougherty, 24, dated her college mentor Joseph Lonsdale, the 32-year-old co-founder of venture capital firm Formation 8, for a year between 2012 and 2013.

But in court papers filed on January 27, the graduate who has modeled for Vogue, describes 'a sexually, emotionally, and physically abusive relationship,' in which she was allegedly assaulted on a regular basis.

She claims Lonsdale deliberately deprived her of food, threw her against walls, and told her women need to be raped to learn respect.

The ordeal, Clougherty says, left her suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder.

Lonsdale has dismissed the allegations as 'a vicious and vengeful campaign...to destroy his reputation with false and outrageous accusations.' 

Rape claims: Former Ford model and Stanford graduate Elise Clougherty, 24, (left) has filed a lawsuit claiming her ex-boyfriend and college mentor, Silicon Valley executive Joseph Lonsdale, 32, (right) raped her

He has filed a counter-claim and set up a website with pictures of 'loving' emails from Clougherty that he claims show their intimacy was consensual.

The pair met in 2011 at a bar in New York when Clougherty was in her second year of study at the Northern California school, and Lonsdale had just set up Formation 8.

A year later, Lonsdale, himself a 2003 Stanford graduate, became Clougherty's official mentor in an entrepreneurship elective run by the university.

They started dating and stayed together for a year.

According to Clougherty, who is seeking at least $75,000 in damages, Lonsdale used his 'leverage' to ensure he would be her mentor in the entrepreneurship elective in February 2012.

That month, she claims, he invited her to his home in Los Altos, California, where he 'repeatedly forced [her] to have sexual contact without her consent.'

A month later, when Clougherty was on a vacation with her family in Spain, Lonsdale asked her to meet him in London and Rome, insisting they would stay in separate rooms, she says.

Ambition: Clougherty first met with Lonsdale to ask him about making it in the world of technology and data

Model: Clougherty, a data science major, modeled for the cover of hit young adult novel series Airhead

'Traumatic': The former model, now studying at UVa, claims Lonsdale deprived her of food 'to manipulate' her

Damages: Clougherty is seeking $75,000 in damages from Lonsdale and his firm for 'negligent supervision'

When she arrived, however, he insisted that she stay in his room and 'forcefully raped' her throughout the trip.

Clougherty's suit, published by TechCrunch, demands damages from Lonsdale and his firm Formation 8, which she accuses of 'negligent supervision'.

It states: 'Throughout this period, Mr. Lonsdale repeatedly commented to Ms. Clougherty that women needed to be raped to learn to be loyal and that they really enjoyed being raped more than they let on.

'In addition to shaking her violently during sexual assaults, he also began strangling her, slapping her, scratching her, yanking her by the hair so hard that he would lift her torso off the bed, and slamming her body against the walls and bedboards.'

She added that he 'deprived her of both food and sleep by scheduling late evening and early morning activities, delaying meals, not ordering her enough food and other such tactics.'

And: 'He often would not let her buy tampons and seemed to relish getting her blood everywhere - on her clothing, bed sheets, hotel furniture, car and bus seats, and elsewhere.'

Clougherty described Lonsdale as using 'many forms of psychological manipulation and control on her, including but not limited to 'positive intermittent reinforcement,' 'gaslighting,' isolation, sleep deprivation, food deprivation, anger, embarrassment, and guilt.'

On her return, Cloughtery filed a complaint to the school, which supported her claim. Lonsdale has been banned from the Stanford campus for 10 years.

Hit back: Lonsdale, 32, has rejected the claims as 'a vicious campaign...to destroy his reputation'

Counterclaim: He has published emails from Clougherty that he says show their relationship was consensual

In his countersuit, which demands $150,000 in damages, Lonsdale says the relationship 'was always consensual'.

He says Clougherty initiated intimate contact, and that they 'took multiple vacations together, got to know each others' families' and 'developed a deep affection for one another'.

In addition, Lonsdale has published stockpiles of emails from Clougherty on a Wordpress site.

Denying the incident she described at his Los Altos home, Lonsdale said they shared their first kiss that night and she emailed to say 'I love getting to know you'.

He says their first sexual encounter was in Rome in March 2012, after which she described in an email as the 'day we shared such a beautfil moment together! If you know what I mean...'

A later message reads: 'The love I feel for you is deep.'

In another email, that spans 10 pages, Clougherty tells Lonsdale her 'perception was warped' when she met him, having just recovered from an eating disorder during which she was committed.

Clougherty is currently a Data Science graduate candidate at the University of Virginia.

Before Formation 8, Lonsdale founded Palantir Technologies in 2004.

Both plaintiffs have requested a jury trial.
