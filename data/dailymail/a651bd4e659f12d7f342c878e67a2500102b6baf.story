For years it was assumed by staff at Lambeth Palace that the oil painting hanging in a private sitting room was of Catherine Parr, Henry VIII's sixth wife.

But when experts from the National Portrait Gallery went to the Palace - the official residence of the Archbishop of Canterbury - to research a portrait of an earlier archbishop, they were able to shed new light on the matter.

First, the portrait was in a frame that pre-dated the rotund monarch's sixth wife, second; her clothes were from an earlier period, and third, well, the woman also bore a startling resemblance to Henry's first wife, Catherine of Aragon.

The first Catherine... or is it? This portrait has finally been confirmed as being of Catherine of Aragon

Much-married monarch: King Henry VIII married Catherine of Aragon in 1509, and Catherine Parr in 1543

Tests soon showed that they were right, and now the gallery has hung the portrait of the devoutly Catholic queen rather mischievously, side by side with a portrait of Henry, whose desperation to divorce her was the catalyst for England's schism with the Catholic church.

The 'exciting discovery' about the picture was made when researchers from the National Portrait Gallery went to Lambeth Palace to find out more about William Warham, the Archbishop of Canterbury who married Henry VIII and his first wife, Catherine of Aragon, in 1509.

The researchers, who were working on a project called Making Art In Tudor Britain, noticed the painting on the wall of a private sitting room, where it has hung since at least the 19th century but probably longer, under the assumption it depicted Catherine Parr.

National Portrait Gallery curator Charlotte Bolland said: 'It was immediately apparent that it was in a very early frame, something which was a relatively rare survival from the early 16th century.

'It was a way of frame-making that went out of fashion. That was a kind of sign that it was something quite interesting.'

They realised that the woman's earlier 
costume and her facial features strongly suggested it was of Catherine 
of Aragon, rather than Catherine Parr, who was born in 1512, three years
 after the first Catherine had married Henry.

The Archbishop of Canterbury allowed the gallery to borrow the portrait, which is oil on panel, for further research, and experts subjected it to x-rays and infra-red light which indicated that under the paint was a green background similar to that on a portrait of Henry painted in 1520.

The research also suggested that the features of the woman's face had been altered, and that she was wearing a veil, which the first Catherine would have done.

The evidence proved conclusively that the portrait was of Catherine of Aragon, who became Henry's first wife after his older brother Arthur, whom she married in 1501, died.

The National Portrait Gallery has now hung the picture next to a similar one of the king.

Ms Bolland said: ‘It is wonderful to have the opportunity to display this important early portrait of Catherine of Aragon at the Gallery.

'Henry VIII and Catherine of Aragon were married for nearly 24 years and during that time their portraits would have been displayed together in this fashion, as king and queen of England.’

Ms Bolland said that discovering the original Tudor finish on a painting like this was 'an extremely rare find'.

She said the portrait had been compared with the gallery's portrait of the king from the same period and both were very similar.

She said: 'Whilst not suggesting the works originally formed a pair, the costume dates them to the same period and the works are of the same scale.

'It is likely that both are examples 
of the type of portraits of the king and queen that would have been 
produced in multiple versions, some of which would have been paired in 
this way.'

Catherine 
failed to produce a son who lived beyond 52 days and so was rejected in 
favour of Anne Boleyn, her husband's pregnant mistress.

Catherine Parr was Henry's sixth and last wife, marrying him in July 1543 and outliving him after he died in 1547.

The portrait was first spotted by National Portrait Gallery staff in 2009 but nothing was announced about who its subject really was until today, following years of research and tests to confirm it.

The portrait is now hung next to the similar oil on panel of Henry VIII in the National Portrait Gallery, where staff say the artists of both are unknown.

Henry and Catherine Reunited is on display from today.

Henry VIII's first wife was the Spanish princess Catherine of Aragon, who had been previously been married to his older brother Arthur.

When Arthur died, six months after their marriage, his younger brother Henry married her in 1509 and Catherine was crowned Queen of England in a joint coronation ceremony with her husband.

Shortly after their marriage Catherine became pregnant but gave birth to a stillborn daughter in January 1510.  A subsequent pregnancy resulted in the birth of Prince Henry in 1511 and there were great celebrations, but he died aged 52 days.

Catherine then had a miscarriage, followed by another short-lived son, but in February 1516, she gave birth to a healthy daughter, Mary, and the child lived.

Henry still loved his wife but became frustrated by the lack of a male heir and took several mistresses, among them Mary Boleyn, sister of Anne.

Anne refused to become Henry's mistress but he pursued her until she succumbed, as his desperation for a son grew.

His worry was all the greater because he had read in Leviticus that if a man married his brother's wife, they would remain childless.  Despite having a daughter, Henry still felt himself 'childless' for not having a son.

The King petitioned the Pope for his marriage to be annulled and when Catherine - a devout Catholic - heard of this, she was so upset that she, too, directly appealed to the Pope on her side.

Catherine's argument was that as she and Arthur had never consummated their marriage, they were not truly husband and wife.

The argument and machinations continued for six years and things came to a head in 1533 when Anne Boleyn became pregnant and Henry decided that the only way to marry her would be to reject the power of the Pope in England and have Thomas Cranmer, the Archbishop of Canterbury, annul the marriage.

Catherine had to renounce her title as Queen and be known as the Princess Dowager of Wales, which she rejected for the rest of her life.

Catherine and her daughter Mary were separated and she was forced to leave the royal court, living in dank manor houses and castles with just a handful of servants.  She was said to suffer ill-health but never complained, and spent much of her time praying.

Catherine and Henry's daughter became Queen Mary I of England in 1553 and was known for her brutal persecution of Protestants - earning her the nickname 'Bloody Mary'.
