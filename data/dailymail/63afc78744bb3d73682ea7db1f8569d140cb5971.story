Former Mets great Dwight ‘Doc’ Gooden was evicted from his New Jersey mansion last month after leaving his wife and kids there without the money to pay the rent.

The Cy Young award winning pitcher has a history of drug and alcohol problems and moved out of the house in March after his wife Monique won a restraining order against him.

Gooden’s family lived in the home without the former big leaguer from March through June without paying the $4,500 monthly rent, until the owners of the home finally got a judge to agree to their eviction June 11.

Home: Gooden's estranged wife Monique and their two children had been living in the $4,500 per month Bergen, New Jersey mansion (pictured) without paying rent since March

The family had been in the luxury digs since 2011, reports the New York Daily News, even after Monique reportedly filed for divorce in November.

The pitcher’s wife won a restraining order against her husband of three years after he made ‘terroristic threats.’

‘All bets are off and I will hurt you and your family,’ Gooden allegedly told his wife. ‘You’ll see, just wait.’

Police
reportedly called a family court judge at the time of the incident and 
Monique was granted a temporary restraining order on the spot.

Back rent: Gooden left his family's home in March after his wife Monique won a restraining order against him for making 'terroristic threats' and no one paid the rent for months

Gooden was told to pack his things and leave the home, but was not arrested. The temporary order also stripped Gooden of his right to visit his children.

According to SI Wire, Monique has made domestic abuse complaints against Gooden before. In 2005, the pitcher was arrested after allegedly hitting Monique in retaliation for throwing a phone at him.

More recently, in 2010, Gooden was arrested on a DUI charge after allegedly leaving the scene of an accident he was involved in while his young son was a passenger in his car.

Plagued: The former major leaguer, called one of the greatest pitchers of all time, saw a promising career spin out of control due to well-publicized arrests and drug abuse

For all his run-ins with the law, Gooden first appeared on the public’s radar as the 19-year-old major league phenom who helped lead the Mets toward one of their best seasons ever. He became the National League Rookie of the Year in 1984.

By 2001, Gooden retired and his series of high profile run ins with the law ensued including a 2006 parole violation that got him seven months behind bars.

Gooden recently released his memoir, titled Doc: A Memoir.

Tagged as 'a bruisingly honest memoir of addiction and recovery from one of the greatest pitchers of all time,' the book came out June 4.
