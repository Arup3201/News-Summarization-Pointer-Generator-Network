They have only just met, but this monkey and gorilla are already the best of friends at their home in Dublin zoo.

Soon after they were introduced, keepers noticed the newly arrived red-capped African mangabey  whisper something into three-year-old gorilla Kituba's ear.

There's no telling what the little mangabey was telling the gorilla, but who knows, he could have been revealing the secret location to a stash of bananas.

Guess what: A red-capped mangabey, left, appears to hug and whisper into three-year-old gorilla Kituba's ear

Can you believe it: Soon after they were introduced, the newly arrived red-capped African mangabey had an in-depth conversation with Kituba

How many bananas: There's no telling what the little mangabey was telling the gorilla, but he could have revealed all about a stash of bananas

Helen 
Clarke Bennett, team leader at the African Plains said: 'It has been 
very exciting to watch the red-capped mangabeys and the gorillas getting
 used to each other over the past few weeks.

'When
 the time came for them to meet face to face things could not have gone 
better. The younger gorillas in particular are very curious about the 
mangabeys and keen to get to know and play with them.'

'To
 introduce and keep these two species in the same space and ensure that 
they live harmoniously together is a challenge but so far it has been 
very successful,' the zoo says.

The mangabeys will be sharing the Gorilla Rainforest with the Zoo’s gorilla family. The distribution of western lowland gorillas and red-capped mangabeys in Africa overlaps.

They are a bachelor group which was formed to assist the European breeding programme for this species.

Lovely to see you: The two primates hit it off immediately according to zoo staff and have remained close

Wearing a crown of red on top of their heads, the red-capped mangabey is a small primate with a distinctive face, white eyes and white fur framing the face.

They are mostly found in coastal, swamp, mangrove, and valley forests, from western Nigeria, east and south Cameroon, and throughout Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, and The Gabon-Congo border by the Atlantic shore.

The petite monkey, also known as the 'collared mangabey' (Cercocebus torquatus) is tall and slender and typically lives in large groups of 10 to 35 individuals including several males.

Mangabeys appear equally at home 30 metres up in the trees and on the ground and have a unique calling pattern in the form of cackles and barks which are used to keep the group in contact and signal their position to other groups.

A throat sac gives resonance to their wide range of calls and is well developed in the males, but females also have small sacs – giving rise to loud cackles, whoops (da-ooo), ‘baddas’ and screams.Their diet consists of fruits and seeds, but they also eat leaves, foliage, flowers, invertebrates, mushrooms, dung, and gum.The monkey has no defined breeding season but reaches sexual maturity at five to seven years.

Due to loss of habitat and being hunting for bushmeat they are listed as vulnerable on the International Union for the Conservation of Nature's Redlist.
