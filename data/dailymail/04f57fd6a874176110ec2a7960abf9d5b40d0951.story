Boris Johnson showed off his tennis skills during a charity match with Andy Murray yesterday.

The Mayor of London contorted his face, balanced on his tip-toes and ran around the court in a white and cream ensemble as his blond hair whipped about in the wind.

Mr Johnson was joined by Sir Richard Branson, comedian Michael McIntyre and chat show host Jonathan Ross in the Rally Against Cancer match.

It took place just after Britain’s number one won the AEGON Championship at Queen’s Club for the third time, beating defending champion Marin Cilic in three sets.

The 26-year-old shed a tear as he dedicated the title to his friend Ross Hutchins, who was diagnosed with cancer a year ago.

After his victory, Mr Murray said: ‘I don’t how many of you know, and I hope everyone can stick around, but we’re playing an exhibition right after we’re done with this nonsense.

‘My best friend Ross Hutchins was diagnosed with cancer about six months ago, he’s dealt with it incredibly well.

'He’s been so brave and just finished his last treatment on Thursday, so all the money we raise is going to the Royal Marsden [Cancer charity], so if you can stay round it would be much appreciated.

‘I honestly want to win this match more than the one we just played. I have to spend the week preparing at Wimbledon with him [Lendl] so if me and Tim lose he’s going to be on me!’
