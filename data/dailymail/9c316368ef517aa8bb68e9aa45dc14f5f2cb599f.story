Dog faeces is the scourge of parks and pavements, and figures suggest that 1,000 tonnes of poo is created each day in the UK alone.

In addition to looking and smelling terrible, the faecal matter can harbour antibiotic-resistant strains of E. coli and parasites - which, when left on the ground, can seep into sewers, rivers and the sea.

And now scientists have developed a new genetic test to figure out the extent to which dogs are spreading this bacteria through our waterways.

Researchers have developed a new genetic testing method to specifically detect canine faecal contamination in water. They identified 12 genetic markers that were common among most of the dog samples, rarely found in other animals, and were not found in the human samples. Technique pictured

In the journal Environmental Science and Technology, Orin Shanks and his colleagues said waterways are susceptible to many sources of faecal contamination, including sewage leaks and droppings from farm animals and wildlife.

Currently, scientists study these water samples for certain genes in gut bacteria that end up in dog faeces.

E. coli, also known as Escherichia coli, is the name of a germ, or bacterium, that lives in the digestive tracts of humans and animals.

There are many types of E. coli, and most of them are harmless.

But some can cause bloody diarrhoea, while others, in particular a strain called O157:H7, may also cause  kidney failure.

There are also strains of E. coli that cause urinary tract infections.

People can get an E. coli infection by coming into contact with faeces.

This happens by drinking or eating contaminated food.

But, this is not a fail-safe approach, because the microbiota of humans and the pets they live with often overlap, making analysis complicated.

Professor Shanks’ team has developed a new genetic testing method to specifically detect canine faecal contamination in water.

They identified 12 genetic markers that were common among most of the dog samples, rarely found in the samples taken from other animals, and were not found in the human samples.

Three in particular – called DG3, DG37, and DG72 – were the most specific and sensitive of the markers studied.

To determine whether this method would work for real-world monitoring, they sampled storm water from a rain garden where people often walk their dogs.

The technique successfully detected some of the same markers they had identified as evidence for canine waste.

Further tests will be carried out before the system can be used more widely.

It’s not just dog faeces that poses a health risk, though.

Seagull droppings on beaches have also been linked to E.coli bacteria found in beach water.

To reduce the risk to beachgoers, Michigan scientists are using border collies as patrol dogs to walk up and down the state’s beaches each day.

The dogs were put on patrol by Central Michigan University last year and are designed to scare the birds away.

Following tests, E.coli levels were found to have ‘significantly’ dropped in the beaches that were being patrolled.
