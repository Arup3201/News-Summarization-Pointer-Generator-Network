Peyton Manning is Sports Illustrated's Sportsman of the Year.

Mr Manning has led Denver to an 11-3 record this year, his second with the Broncos after missing the 2011 season with Indianapolis because of neck troubles that affected his right triceps.

He has thrown 47 touchdown passes, three shy of Patriots quarterbackTom Brady's NFL season record set in 2007, and he has two games remaining.

Man of the hour: Denver Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning (18) passes Thursday night in the third quarter against the San Diego Chargers

Mr Manning last year won the NFL's Comeback Player of the Year Award after returning from multiple neck surgeries that many feared would end his career.

The Denver Broncos star spent 14 years 
with the Indianapolis Colts before being released after sitting out the 
2011 season while rehabbing from the surgeries.

Huge honor: Mr Manning is the fourth quarterback in the last nine years to win the honor

'I have no idea who wants me, what team wants me, how this process works,' he said between tears at the press conference announcing the end of his time with the Colts.

The veteran was already a first-ballot hall of famer at the time, but his 2013 season puts him on par with the all-time greats who have ever played the game.

'When great competitors get scorned, they come back with a vengeance,' former Broncos quarterback and current Executive Vice President of Football Operations John Elway told Sports Illustrated. 'We signed a Hall of Famer with a chip on his shoulder'

That uncertainty must have motivated him, because he's having the greatest season by a quarterback in the 97 year history of the NFL - he's poised to break both the single-season touchdown and passing yards records.

He has also guided his team to the top seed in the AFC playoffs - all at the age of 37.

Mr Manning is the fourth NFL quarterback to take the honor in the last nine years, following Brady in 2005, Brett Favre in 2007 and Drew Brees in 2010. LeBron James was the winner last year.
