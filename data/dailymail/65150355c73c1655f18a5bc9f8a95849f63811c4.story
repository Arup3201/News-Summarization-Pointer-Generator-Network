A man accused of shooting dead three people at a party near Auburn University turned himself in tonight following a manhunt.

Desmonte Leonard, 22, handed himself over to authorities at a Montgomery courthouse at 7.50 pm after his family contacted attorney Susan James for help.

The lawyer contacted U.S. Marshals before going to pick up Leonard. She would not reveal the exact location of the meeting but said it was around 50 miles outside of Montgomery, Alabama.

She said: 'He was very calm, very tired and very ready to get this over with and very respectful.'

She said they had time to talk while 
driving to Montgomery and added: 'When the full story is told, it may 
sound different than the perception now.'

Ms James said she had not been retained to represent the young man.

Leonard, 22, is charged with three 
counts of capital murder after a shooting at a party on Saturday night 
following a fight over a woman.

He is accused of wounding three 
others. The dead included two former Auburn football players and a 
current player was among the injured.

Auburn football coach Gene Chizik said: 'I've
got a team of 120-some-odd players right now that are really just 
trying to navigate what is a lot of questions that aren't answered.

'We're trying to do that as a coaching staff and I think the entire Auburn community is trying to do the same thing.'

Response: Police and firemen were stationed outside the house in anticipation of Leonard's arrest - although hours later it was discovered he had already fled

Police surrounded a house in Montgomery on Monday afternoon thinking that Leonard was inside after they received two solid tips.

They swarmed a home with tear gas, spy gear and assault rifles but after a tense, nine-hour search, they discovered Leonard had fled by the time they arrived.

At one point, they believed they heard movement and coughing in the attic but the search turned up nothing.

Believing Leonard was hiding in the attic, officers fired tear gas into the rafters and poked through insulation.

But after midnight, they acknowledged they hadn't heard those noises for several hours. Officials said officers found nothing in the attic - not even an animal that might have fooled detection devices.

After police left, at least two holes
were visible in the ceiling and the floor was littered with pieces of 
drywall and insulation.

Leonard had a connection 
to the house through someone other than the owner, said the city's 
public safety director, Chris Murphy. He declined to elaborate. The 
woman is not accused of any wrongdoing.

Earlier on Monday police said they had arrested two men accused of hampering the search.

Jeremy S. Thomas, 18, of 
Montgomery was charged with hindering prosecution after he fled the 
scene of the shooting with Leonard. Records show Thomas was free on bond
at the time of the Auburn shootings while awaiting a manslaughter trial
set to begin June 18 in last year's shooting death of a teenager.

Gabriel
Thomas, 41, was also charged with hindering prosecution after having 
contact with Leonard after the shooting and providing false information 
to officers.

The dead included former Auburn players Edward Christian, who had to quit the team because of a lingering back injury, and Ladarious Phillips, who was transferring from Auburn to Jacksonville State University to play football. The other person killed was Demario Pitts, 20.

Of the three people who were wounded, current Auburn football player Eric Mack and Xavier Moss were both treated and released from a hospital. The third, John Robertson, remained in critical condition after being shot in the head.

A witness who identified himself as a friend of Mr Pitts said he didn't know the man who pulled out a gun and began firing into the crowd following a dispute over a woman.

'I ain't never seen him a day of my life,' said Turquorius Vines, 23, who wasn't injured.

Residents have been prevented from leaving or entering the complex until police have made further investigations

Police have arrested Leonard on two previous charges involving guns.

Court records show Montgomery police arrested Leonard in 2008 on a charge of carrying a pistol without a license, after stopping a suspected stolen vehicle and finding him inside. Documents available online didn't show whether the case was ever resolved, but Leonard was freed on bond within days.

Leonard was charged in 2009 with assault after a man was shot in the groin, but prosecutors dropped the case after the victim told authorities Leonard wasn't the shooter.

A Montgomery woman filed a paternity suit against Leonard on Friday that identified him as the father of a girl who turned one last month.

Another woman sued him in 2009 seeking unpaid child support for a girl who is now four. A court ordered monthly payments of $305 by Leonard, who records show was working at a Walmart store at the time.

Auburn police said the shootings did not appear to have anything to do with some of the victims being former or current players on the football team, which won the national championship in 2010.
