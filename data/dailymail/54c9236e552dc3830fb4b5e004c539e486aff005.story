When holidaymakers decide to splash out on a Caribbean cruise, it's likely they want a temporary reprieve from the cold.

But Norwegian Cruise Line has announced that its newest ship  will include the company's first-ever Snow Room.

This winter oasis, which will be created on board Norwegian Escape, will form part of the ship's Thermal Suite and will be kept between -6C and 0C.

The company said there will even be powdery snow flurries throughout the day, in a bid to keep the arctic atmosphere authentic.

According to those behind the design, the Snow Room 'offers guests a multitude of health benefits', including increasing blood circulation in the body and strengthening the immune system. 

The 164,000 tonne ship is currently being built at Meyer Werft in Germany and will start sailing on seven-day cruises in November this year.

The liner, which can cater for 4,200 passengers, will travel from Miami to the Eastern Caribbean including St. Thomas in the U.S. Virgin Islands, Tortola in the British Virgin Islands and Nassau in the Bahamas.

The company has concentrated on the cold theme before, with a series of 'Ice Bars' on board their ships

Also on board the ship will be 28 restaurants, the Broadway musical Legally Blonde and a spa.

For those wishing to keep away from the cold, there will also be 17 heated loungers, a hydro-therapy pool and a sauna.
