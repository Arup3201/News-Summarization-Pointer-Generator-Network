A new applicant is signing on to claim Disability Living Allowance every nine minutes – just a few weeks before it is blocked to first-time claimants.

Some 164 more people are given the benefit each day, the latest figures show. There were 15,000 new claims over three months, compared with 11,000 during the same period last year.

The rush to secure the state payout is thought to be because its replacement will have tougher eligibility tests.

Reforms: The rush to secure Disability Living Allowance comes ahead of new, tougher eligibility criteria

In the past decade, the number of people receiving DLA has soared by more than a third, from 2.4million to 3.3million.

The cost to the taxpayer is now £13billion a year. An astonishing seven out of ten claimants – 71 per cent – have been offered the benefit for life without any checks to see if they still need it, according to the Department for Work and Pensions.

From April, DLA will gradually be replaced by the Personal Independence Payment (PIP), which is being introduced in an attempt to cut the nation’s benefits bill.

To get the PIP, people must have a face-to-face assessment, rather than simply filling out a form.

At first, the change will apply only to new applicants in the North of England, but it will be rolled out nationwide in June.

Those already on DLA will begin to be reassessed from October. Most will not face checks until 2015, after a review of the system gives its findings in 2014.

The one-on-one interviews are being brought in to look at exactly how someone’s impairment affects their ability to live a normal life.

They will look at a broad range of everyday activities such as cooking and getting around.

Government estimates show that without reform, DLA claims would grow by more than 400,000 in the next five years.

The number receiving the grant was forecast to have reached 3.6million by 2018 unless it was replaced with the PIP.

That would be more than treble the number – 1.1million – who received the benefit when it was created under a Tory government in 1992.

Esther McVey, the minister for disabled people, said: 'Disability Living Allowance is an outdated benefit introduced over 20 years ago.

'The Personal Independence Payment will include a new face-to-face assessment and regular reviews – something missing in the current system.’

She added: 'Our welfare reforms are about ensuring the billions we spend on disability benefits give more targeted support to those who need it most.'

Unlike other benefits, which will go up by only 1 per cent this year, DLA and the PIP will grow with inflation, rising 2.2 per cent.

The PIP, like DLA, will be a non-means-tested, non-taxable cash benefit which can be claimed whether in or out of work.

It will pay £53 a week, with a £79.15 enhanced rate for those who need constant care.

There are also mobility grants to help people get around, of £21 a week or a £55.25 higher rate.

The reforms provoked anger from disability rights groups. A recent poll by campaign organisation Disability Alliance found 9 per cent of respondents said losing their DLA 'may make life not worth living’.

The group has also protested that the Government had already identified desired cuts in spending before consulting the public on which elements of benefits needed to be reformed.

An earlier version of this article stated that half of all decisions on Disability Living Allowance are made ‘without any medical evidence’. We are happy to clarify that this referred to any additional information above that already declared on application forms and any accompanying reports from GPs, consultants or other health professionals.
