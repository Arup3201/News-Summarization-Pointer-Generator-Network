Tackling issues: Katherine Preston, 29, travelled all over America to see front line treatment for stutterers

It was just a simple request to invite her godmother to her next ballet performance, but the moment is for ever etched in Katherine Preston’s memory. As she stood in her tutu at the age of seven, her voice faltered and she was unable to get the question out.

‘Try as I might, I just couldn’t  get past the B in ballet,’ she says. ‘It felt like a barrier had closed the path from my lungs to my mouth. That was the first moment I was aware I had a stutter.’

Now, 22 years later, Katherine’s stammer remains. This common speech problem affects about one person in every 100, causing them to be blocked or stuck at the beginning, middle and end of words and leading them to repeat words several times over.

The morning of our interview, I notice Katherine is struggling with long, drawn-out Ls, Ks and Ws.  ‘And all the rest of the alphabet,’  she laughs.

Such is the impact of her stutter that five years ago Katherine, now 29, decided to quit her job in asset management in London and set off on a year-long fact-finding trip around America to work out how she could rid herself of the speech impediment.

After travelling from coast to coast to witness treatments at the forefront of stutter research, she has written a memoir about her experiences – which also led her to fall in love with a fellow stutterer.

For in the course of that trip, it transpired that far from ruining  her life, Katherine’s stutter was the making of her.

‘I am not sure who I would be without my stutter,’ she says. ‘Today I can see that stuttering has given me far more than it ever took away.’

It’s a surprisingly positive attitude for someone who, by the age of eight, had transformed from an outgoing little girl to a shy, withdrawn child as her speech let her down. Her worried parents took her to see the UK’s best speech therapists but watched in dismay as Katherine continued to clench, whistle and choke on her words.

‘Growing up, I heard strangers tell me to slow down, calm down or take a deep breath – as if stuttering was that easy to overcome,’ Katherine recalls. ‘I was desperate to find a way to “fix” my problem and went in and out of speech therapy for years trying to be fluent.’

While she was never bullied and had a loyal circle of friends, her stutter made her less vocal at school.

‘In class, I wanted to be able to interact and answer a question but held back,’ she says. ‘For a while I became a sort of walking thesaurus. I’d deliberately dodge hard words and rack my brain for an alternative. Often I wasn’t saying what I wanted to say. I felt my stutter made others question my intelligence and sanity.’

After Durham University, Katherine started climbing the corporate ladder in London. Although doing well at work and on the verge of promotion, at the age of 24 she still felt ashamed of her speech. It was time to take her stutter in hand.

‘For years I believed that stuttering was my fault, that it would hold me back, that it made me ugly,’ she says. ‘The biggest battle I had to fight was breaking through the glass ceiling I’d created for myself.’

So in September 2008, Katherine vowed to devote a year to touring the US, interviewing as many stutterers, researchers and speech therapists as possible. Starting in Boston and travelling from state to state, she painstakingly researched the different schools of thought on the causes and cures.

For years I believed that stuttering was my fault, that it would hold me back, that it made me ugly. I had created a glass ceiling for myself.

‘Treatments ranged from vitamin supplements, relaxation classes and hypnosis to cranial osteopathy and electric shock treatment,’ she says.

‘One involved whispering in a “phone sex” voice, and some therapists handed out gifts for fluent words – to positively reinforce the stutter out of our voices.’

In California, Katherine met physician and fellow stutterer Dr Gerald Macguire, who believes that adults who stutter often have excessive dopamine in their brains, drawing strong similarities to Tourette’s syndrome.

According to Macguire, surplus dopamine can affect the brain’s natural timer and speech initiation – something he remedied by taking asenapine (commonly used to treat bipolar disorder and schizophrenia) with positive results.

He claims his stutter would return within three days of him stopping medication.

With 70 per cent of Macguire’s patients reporting benefits, this was the closest Katherine had come to finding a cure – but she had reservations. ‘Although drugs had helped many people, I was unsure about achieving fluency with medications that were still in their infancy for stuttering,’ she says. ‘I wanted to continue my search.’

As well as interviewing doctors and researchers, Katherine met stutterers from all walks of life –ranging from New Mexican ranchers to Hollywood celebrities.

‘Film star Emily Blunt confided that acting helped her to be someone else and overcome her stutter, while Michael Palin told me about his experiences growing up with a father who stuttered.’

It was at a speech therapy course in Washington DC that Katherine met her now-fiance Jeremy Cohen. After an immediate rapport, their romance was sealed when he agreed to join her on a six-week research road trip from Texas to California.

‘Meeting Jeremy and falling in love with him changed the way I saw stuttering,’ says Katherine. ‘I don’t think I realised how interesting and attractive stutterers could be. Watching his determination to be heard opened up a new way for me to be proud of who I was.’

After 12 months exploring dozens of techniques, treatments and therapies, Katherine came to an unexpected decision. Rather than taking medication or speaking in a controlled manner, she would try voluntary stuttering – a technique pioneered in the 1950s by stutterer and speech therapist Joseph Sheehan.

‘Sheehan did not believe that stutterers should or could speak fluently,’ she explains. ‘Instead, he preached self-acceptance. The idea is that if you stutter on purpose in the lead-up to a problematic word, then you will feel in control once you reach it.’ Katherine first tried voluntary stuttering at a Boston Starbucks, deliberately stammering through her order without apology and taking as much time as she needed to get out each word.

‘It was empowering for me to be  in control of my speech. Stuttering on purpose allowed me to go through the motions without having the anxiety and worry,’ she says. ‘It goes against the habits I’ve learnt over the years but enables me to feel good, own the fact that I stutter and be extremely comfortable with it.’

Now, four years on and living in San Francisco running a mobile phone exchange business with  Jeremy, Katherine sees her stutter as a quirk of her character rather than an enemy.

‘For ages it was as though my stutter was an impostor in my body but everyone has parts of themselves that they are worried about, or some vulnerability. Ultimately my speech has given me the career I dreamed off, the man I want to grow old with – and introduced me to a community of incredible people.

‘I’ve realised that our imperfections are actually what make us attractive and interesting.’
