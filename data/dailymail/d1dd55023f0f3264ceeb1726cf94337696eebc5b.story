When Sophie Aldridge went to hospital complaining of back ache, doctors dismissed her with a dose of painkillers.

Hours later, she was back in hospital – giving birth.

The 20-year-old had no idea she was expecting as she didn’t put on weight, still wore her size-ten clothes and continued having regular periods throughout the pregnancy.

She even kept going on nights out with friends up until 5lb 8oz son Thomas arrived.

Surprise: Sophie Aldridge, 20, had no idea she was pregnant when she woke in the middle of the night with severe back ache. Her son Thomas was born just hours later

Miss Aldridge said: ‘It was a big shock to everyone when I suddenly arrived home with a baby.

‘When I gave birth I didn’t even have a nappy to my name, let alone clothes, pram, cot … I had nothing.’

Miss
 Aldridge, who lives with her parents in Dover, Kent, had woken up in 
the middle of the night with agonising back ache, but blamed it on 
period pains.

When her 
condition deteriorated the next day, her mother took her  to hospital, 
but doctors couldn’t  find anything wrong and sent her  away with drugs 
to make her  more comfortable.

Shortly
 after arriving home, however, the pain became too much to bear and Miss
 Aldridge was taken back to hospital in an ambulance. 

It was only then 
that paramedics broke the news that she was pregnant and in labour – and
 Thomas was born less than half an hour after she arrived at A&E.

Miss
 Aldridge, who works as a carer, said: ‘I was due to come on to my 
period that day so I thought that must have been why I was having such 
bad pains.

‘I know it might sound really stupid to some people but I  literally had no idea I was  pregnant – I didn’t have  any symptoms.

‘I
 didn’t get morning sickness, I stayed wearing my size-ten clothes, I 
had regular periods throughout the pregnancy and I didn’t have any 
cravings. To give birth there and then like I did was absolutely 
terrifying.’

Fortunately, friends and family rallied around to help the single mother cope with the unexpected arrival.

She
 said: ‘When I came home from hospital my friends and family had come 
together and donated nearly everything Thomas and I needed, which was so
 kind.’

'Miracle': Miss Aldridge had thought her back pain was period pain - but then her waters broke and baby Thomas arrived half an hour later

Miss Aldridge had still been enjoying frequent nights out with 
friends right up until Thomas’s arrival.

She
 said: ‘I was still going out and getting drunk with my friends while I 
was pregnant – I had no idea I was pregnant, obviously.

‘I was still wearing crop-tops and mini skirts, I didn’t have a bump or anything.’

Her
 pregnancy was discovered in November only after the crippling back ache
 struck. Her worried mother called 111 for emergency advice and took her
 daughter to William Harvey Hospital in Ashford, but doctors found 
nothing wrong.

Miss Aldridge said: ‘A doctor gave me some tablets and then just sent me home.

‘I
 thought that obviously everything was fine and normal and that it must 
have just been period pain – they wouldn’t have sent me home otherwise.’

Miss Aldridge said: 'I know it might sound really stupid to some people, but I literally had no idea I was pregnant - I didn't have any symptoms'

Just hours after returning
 home, however, the pain became too much to bear and her mother called 
an ambulance to take her back to the hospital.

In the ambulance, Miss 
Aldridge’s waters broke and paramedics realised she was in labour.

‘The next thing I remember I was in hospital with a baby in my arms,’ she said. 

‘Everything was just so quick I didn’t really have time to gauge what was happening.

‘I was only in labour for 30 minutes.

‘In a way I’m so glad it  all happened – I wouldn’t change Thomas for the  world now. I like to call him my little miracle.’

Unprepared: 'When I came home from hospital my friends and family had come together and donated nearly everything me and Thomas needed, which was so kind', said Miss Aldridge

The
 phenomenon of undiagnosed pregnancy isn’t quite as rare as might be 
expected. Studies have shown that  up to one in 600 mothers-to-be do not
 realise they are pregnant until they give birth, or just before.

It
 is more likely to occur among menopausal women and younger, busy women 
because they are not expecting to be pregnant and will not be looking 
for the signs.

It is not 
uncommon for  pregnant women to experience some light bleeding – or  
‘spotting’ – especially in the first few months, which can allow them to
 think they are still menstruating.

Many don’t put on very much weight and won’t necessarily have a defined bump.

Although the average woman puts on two stone, some gain as little as half a stone and can still fit into the same clothes.
