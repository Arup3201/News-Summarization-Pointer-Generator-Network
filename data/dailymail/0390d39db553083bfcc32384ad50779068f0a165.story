Prisoners are being paid £15 a day to work in a call centre selling ‘green’ solar panels and home insulation to the public.

The inmates reportedly include a killer and a fraudster, and customers will have no idea they are talking to a serving prisoner.

The Ministry of Justice has struck a controversial deal to give the inmates work experience at the South Wales environmental roofing company Becoming Green.

Solar energy company Becoming Green employs 25 inmates from the prison in south Wales to work in its call centre

They are taken by bus 21 miles from 
Prescoed prison near Usk in Monmouthshire to work in the company’s 
telephone sales division in Cardiff.

Prisoners do not cold call members of 
the public, according to the Ministry of Justice. Instead they answer 
calls from people who have rung in response to adverts or following cold
calling by other call centre staff.

Union leaders claim that, since the 
deal was struck, regular workers on full wages at the company have been 
fired. Andy Richards, Unite Wales regional secretary, said: ‘This looks 
likes a disgraceful and worrying development.

‘It is nothing short of Dickensian to exploit prisoners [in this way] while Cardiff call centre workers lose their jobs.

‘This company seems to be all too 
readily taking advantage of cheap labour.

Not only is it fundamentally 
immoral but it’s bad for the Welsh workforce and damaging to the Welsh 
economy.’

In total, Becoming Green has taken on 
23 day-release prisoners. Of these, 12 are receiving £15 a day, which is
to pay for food, at a rate of £5 for each of their three meals.

Prison 
Services rules would allow the company to pay prisoners only £5 a day if
it chose.

Under the deal with prison bosses, the
company can pay this rate for at least 40 working days.

Once their work
experience is over, the inmates switch to the minimum wage, which is 
£6.08 per hour for workers aged 21 and over.

The 11 prisoners receiving 
the minimum wage are allowed to keep 60 per cent of what they earn, but 
the other 40 per cent goes into a victims’ fund, according to the Prison
Service.

Prescoed is an open prison and inmates
on day release schemes will have been assessed by officials as no 
longer posing a risk to the public or being likely to abscond, even 
though their convictions are for serious offences.

Steve Gillan, general secretary of the
Prison Officers Association, said that for any company to rely on cheap
labour of prisoners was ‘immoral and disgusting’.

But the Ministry of Justice said it 
was vital to give prisoners the skills they need to get back into work 
if re-offending is to be reduced.

A Prison Service spokesman said: ‘Our 
rules are very clear: prisoners employed by outside companies cannot 
replace existing staff. They can only fill genuinely vacant posts.

‘Becoming Green have made it clear 
that the prisoners they employ are filling genuinely vacant posts and 
that no serving members of staff have been made redundant to make way 
for prisoners.

‘The company has expanded over the 
past year, employing more members of the public, not less, and is still 
advertising.

When the scheme started in November last year they had 100 
employees, now they have more than 190 of whom just 23 are prisoners.

‘It is crucial that prisoners have the
opportunity to learn transferable employment skills to reduce the 
chances of reoffending, and therefore turning them away from crime.’

In a statement, Becoming Green said: 
‘Corporations should have a social responsibility to help society. If 
they work with this attitude and behaviour it will help make a better 
society for all.'

More than 2,000 people have applied for just 15 jobs at a new sofa shop.

The DFS furniture store in Stockport was inundated with applications for just 15 new jobs

Furniture chain DFS has been inundated with applications for its store at Peel Retail Park, Stockport, which opens at the end of the month.

A total of 2,168 applied for the posts - the equivalent of 144 people chasing each job.

Politicians and business leaders say the figure is a reflection of the difficult economic times.

Stockport MP Ann Coffey said: 'We hear a lot about how Stockport is booming, but this is clearly a reflection of the wider economic situation, so there is no room for complacency.'

Ms Coffey, a member of shopworkers union USDAW, says retail jobs are popular with jobseekers because they offer career opportunities and flexible working hours.

She added: 'This number of applications is a reflection of the levels of unemployment - there is not a lot of choice around.'

Dr Brian Sloan, chief economist at Greater Manchester Chamber of Commerce, said: 'It is no surprise that DFS had 2,168 applicants for 15 jobs, given that the business is successful, growing and has a high profile as both a TV advertiser and a large retail outlet.

'Competition for jobs is tough at present and there will be a lot of disappointment.'
