Police have refused to confirm or deny whether they are investigating if a stylish bandit who held up a McDonalds restaurant in country New South Wales with a large knife was dressed as a character from a popular video game.

On Tuesday morning, police announced they were hunting for a sharply dressed criminal who entered the fast food outlet in Tamworth shortly after midnight on Sunday October 26 wielding a large butcher's knife and demanding cash.

Wearing a double-breasted navy blazer and a balaclava, the mystery man - who was dubbed the 'suited bandit' by police in a statement on Tuesday morning - shares a remarkable resemblance to the video game character The Spy from online action game Team Fortress 2.

Police would not confirm or deny whether the man's apparent resemblance to The Spy (above) was one of their lines of inquiry 

According to an online fan encyclopaedia, The Spy 'is an enthusiast of sharp suits and even sharper knives'. 

The French-speaking character is known for his 'swift backstabs' which will 'kill any foe in a single hit', the page said.

A NSW police spokesman would only say: 'The focus of the police investigation is identifying the man involved'. 

Tamworth station duty officer, Inspector Matt French, told Daily Mail Australia he was unsure if the man's resemblance to The Spy was among detectives' lines of inquiry. 

'They (detectives) are on a number of lines of inquiry,' he said. 

The suspect, who was also decked out in black leather gloves, grey pants and black shoes, was seen in CCTV footage hovering over a McDonalds staff member with his weapon as a worker frantically emptied two cash registers.

Detectives said the stylish suspect - who was described as having a deep English accent and being around 180 to 185cm tall - fled the Roderick St restaurant on foot, apparently with his loot. 

A McDonalds staff member confirmed the restaurant had been robbed and told Daily Mail Australia staff 'weren't doing any interviews'. 

The suspect had entered the McDonalds outlet, located near the New England and Oxley Highways, via the backdoor.

Detectives are urging anyone with information about the identity of the suited man to contact Tamworth Police or CrimeStoppers on 1800 333 000.
