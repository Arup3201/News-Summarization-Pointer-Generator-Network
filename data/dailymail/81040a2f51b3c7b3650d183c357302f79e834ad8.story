Thumbs up: David Cameron shows his appreciation for the Mo-bot during a meeting between the PM and double Olympic gold medallist Mo Farah

Mo Farah shows David Cameron how to do the ‘Mo-bot’ at Downing Street yesterday.

The PM responded with a rather less inspiring thumbs up.

The 10,000m and 5,000m winner showed off his trademark celebration, then went on to mimic sprint star Usain Bolt.

Somalian refugee Farah was greeted by cheers as he arrived to attend a summit to discuss world hunger, hosted by Mr Cameron.

The Prime Minister praised Team GB’s star athlete as an example of someone who had ‘run his way into the nation’s heart’.

Brazilian football star Pele and the country’s vice president, Michel Temer, were also present.

Brazil hosts the next Olympics in 2016.Members of the UN, aid organisations and the European Union also attended.

The aim of the summit was to raise the profile of tackling hunger and malnutrition.

Prime Minister David Cameron hopes to
secure sufficient commitments from leaders and multinational firms to 
help prevent 25 million children under five suffering stunted growth by 
the time of the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

Farah, who has set up his own charity 
to raise money to help the victims of the severe drought in the Horn of 
Africa, arrived at Number 10 to cheers after his achievements in winning
both the 10,000m and 5,000m.

Speaking
at the start of the summit, Farah said: ‘I'm lucky to have set up a new
life here, and growing up here, after being in Somalia as a little boy.

‘But there are kids out there facing hunger and starvation and we've got to do something about it.

‘There are kids out there who need our help.

‘It really touches my heart.’

Farah
gave a thumbs up as he arrived at Number 10 before performing the 
‘mobot’ - the celebration he displayed after winning both London gold 
medals.

He later said: ‘Winning my second gold 
last night was a dream come true, but I'm here today for perhaps the 
most important race of all, the race to tackle hunger and malnutrition 
around the world.

‘Last year I visited Somalia during 
the famine. It was shocking to see people in the country where I was 
born simply not having enough food to eat. My wife and I came back from 
Somalia determined to do what we can to help people there rebuild their 
lives.

‘The London Olympics
have been an incredible two weeks. And now we have an opportunity to 
make the legacy of these Olympics one that will inspire generations at 
home and also one that could save the lives of millions of children, and
give them the chance to thrive and to fulfill their potential.’

Ahead
of the summit, five children ran with Ethiopian distance runner Haile 
Gebrselassie around the bend of an athletics track in Downing Street, 
before handing a baton to Mr Cameron as part of a symbolic ‘race against
hunger’.

The Prime Minister then joined Farah, 
Gebrselaissie, Brazilian football star Pele and the country's 
vice-president Michel Temer as they signed the baton to show their 
support for tackling child hunger.

The summit brought together leaders and senior politicians from Brazil, Kenya, Bangladesh, India and Ireland.

Gebreselaissie told the political figures gathered that his home country had been ‘blighted’ by poverty and hunger.

Pointing
out that Ethiopia had won three London gold medals, he said: ‘Just 
imagine what my country could have achieved if half of our children 
weren't suffering from malnutrition.’

Britain
has promised a £120 million investment in drought-resistant crop 
research, help for schemes such as a text message hunger alert system in
Kenya and pressure on multinational firms to play their part.

Another
of Team GB's gold medal winners, long jumper Greg Rutherford, is among 
signatories to an open letter urging Mr Cameron to ‘fire the starting 
gun on the biggest ever push against hunger and malnutrition’.
