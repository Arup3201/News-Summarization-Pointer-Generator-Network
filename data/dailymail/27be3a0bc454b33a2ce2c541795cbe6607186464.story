A new ruling of a controversial Montana judge who sentenced a rapist teacher to just 30 days in prison has been called into question.

Gregory Todd Baugh has ordered a 27-year-old convicted killer who punched his girlfriend, fracturing her face in three places, to write 'boys do not hit girls' 5,000 times and send it to him.

The bizarre Bart Simpson-style sentence comes just four months after Baugh ordered rapist Stacey Rambold to spend a month in jail because the teacher had 'suffered enough' and his victim was 'in control'.

The Billings Gazette reported Baugh on Monday ordered girlfriend beater Pacer Anthony Ferguson to number his list, sign it and mail it to him by May 23.

He also sentenced Ferguson to six-months jail and ordered him to pay more than $3,800 in restitution for his victim’s medical bills.

Ferguson, from Montana, beat his girlfriend on August 24 last year. The woman said she still suffers double vision when she looks up or down and that she has occasional pain and numbness in her face.

A jury convicted Ferguson on the misdemeanor assault charge but acquitted him of felony aggravated assault and felony witness tampering, which would have attracted a five to 100-year prison sentence.

Ferguson also appeared on Monday in a separate hearing before Baugh in relation to a sentence for a felony attempted robbery in 2003.

In that case, Ferguson attempted to rob a man at knife point in a Walmart parking lot, according to court records. Todd ruled that Ferguson violated the terms of his release for the robbery multiple times, including with the assault on the woman.

History of crime: When he was 13, Ferguson released a train car which rolled down the tracks and killed a man

Todd revoked Ferguson's prior 
sentence and ordered him to spend eight years in the Montana State 
Prison to run concurrent to his sentence for the assault.

Chief
 Deputy Yellowstone County Attorney Juli M. Pierce said after the 
hearing that she respects the two sentences the judges gave Ferguson.

Ferguson has spent the past decade in and out of jail, 
ever since he was sentenced at 14 for releasing a train car that rolled 
down the tracks and killed a man. He was 13 at the time of the incident.

Baugh set off a public furor in August when he said 14-year-old rape victim Cherice Morales appeared 'older than her chronological age'.

Teacher Rambold admitted to raping Morales when she was a troubled high school freshman at Billings Senior High School in 2008. She later committed suicide.

While Baugh apologized for his comments, he maintains his sentence was appropriate.

The state is appealing the sentence and women's groups are calling for Baugh's removal from the bench.
