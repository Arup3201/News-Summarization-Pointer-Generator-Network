They provide a snapshot of Britain 60 years ago as millions of families across Britain gathered together to celebrate the coronation of Queen Elizabeth.

Street parties from Dorset to Middlesbrough were held, children took part in fancy dress competitions and neighbours crowded together to watch the event unfold for the first time on television.

As the Queen celebrates the 60th anniversary of her Coronation today, people around the country have shared their memories and pictures of the event through the website Friends Reunited.

It is exactly 60 years since she made her way, as a 27-year-old monarch, to Westminster Abbey to be crowned.

In
1953, more than 8,200 guests witnessed the historic proceedings and an 
estimated 27million people in Britain watched the events unfold on 
television.

It was the first time a Coronation had been broadcast live but few families had televisions.

Nellena Ellen, from Margate, Kent, watched the Coronation, famously narrated by Richard Dimbleby, on a neighbour's set.

Ms Ellen, who was six at the time and dressed in a cloak and crown for the occasion, said: 'I remember going into my neighbour's 
house to watch the coronation on their black and white television.

'We 
didn’t have a television and I believe they were the only family in the 
street to have one.'

Some families did not have access to a TV set at all but still joined in the carnival atmosphere.

Jim Loader, from Bournemouth, whose 
family did not get a TV until 1959, said: 'I can remember it being fun 
as the whole street was involved and of course, no cars so the whole 
area was closed off.

'It was a very happy atmosphere throughout the day and everyone was friendly. I would guess each street and homeowner was responsible for organising their own party.

'I can recall we had sandwiches, cakes, lemonade and possibly ice cream too.'

Sue Aldridge, from Birkenhead, said she and her parents excitedly prepared the tables and chairs for the big day.

She even wore a specially made red, white and blue dress for the occasion.

Ms Aldridge said: 'Later in the evening all the parents sat out in the street, having a drink and dancing. A piano appeared from somewhere and all the children were allowed to stay up late.

'I remember all the children being so excited, helping to carry things out from all the houses, helping to lay the tables and carry the food and drink out, which came from all the houses.

'We were the only family with a television so our house was packed out, everyone came in to watch the Coronation and I remember being squashed in a corner.

'All the neighbours put the party together. We had sandwiches, cakes, jelly, sweets and pop all supplied by the parents.'

The Coronation took place 16 months 
after the Queen acceded to the throne, allowing a period of mourning for
her father King George VI and time to get the detailed preparations in 
place.

It was a day of pomp and pageantry as thousands took to the streets despite the rainy weather to see the Queen's procession.

In Middlesbrough, half the street sheltered from the rain in Stephanie Towell's family home to watch the Coronation on their television.

She said: 'The mothers collected and saved the money to pay for the party by holding raffles, which were filled with little gifts. They must have worked hard to collect the money, as people didn't have a lot to spare. Each child got a presentation gift; I received a cup, saucer, plate and teaspoon.'

Michael Jackson, from Lewisham, said: 'At the age of seven the whole thing was strange to me, everyone seemed to be dressed up and bunting was put across the road for the whole length of the street.'

Brenda Glasspool said her memories of their street party in Berkshire are 'wonderful'.

She said: 'I remember looking forward to it for ages and the fun we would have at the street party.

'We were having all the usual things 
to eat, small sandwiches, sausage rolls, jelly, lemonade and orange 
squash, cake.  All of which our mothers made and took along on various 
plates.

'I will be watching all the national festivities on TV being 72 years of age now.'

Matt Bushby, head of Friends Reunited, said: 'With the entire country in celebratory mood we thought it would be great to remember an iconic moment in British history, as we look ahead to create new memories to save and share with our friends and family on Friends Reunited.

'It is really interesting to see the depth of community spirit and how everyone got together to celebrate the occasion. Often there were only a few televisions in each street so dozens of people would be crowded into living rooms around one black and white set.'

Last year's Diamond Jubilee was the 
focal point for national celebrations, with a river pageant down the 
Thames involving a flotilla of 1,000 boats, a concert in front of 
Buckingham Palace and a traditional service of thanksgiving at St Paul's
Cathedral.

But today the Queen is marking the anniversary privately.

She is expected to be at her favourite royal residence Windsor Castle, where she likely to attend church at a private chapel within the estate.

Commemorations this year are a more low-key affair than last year's events of those held 60 years ago.

Commemorations will centre on the Queen's return to her Coronation church with a service for 2,000 guests in the Abbey on Tuesday June 4.

Joined by a strong supporting cast of royals including the Duke of Edinburgh, the Prince of Wales, the Duchess of Cornwall, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry, the monarch will listen to an address by the Archbishop of Canterbury and a reading by Prime Minister David Cameron.
