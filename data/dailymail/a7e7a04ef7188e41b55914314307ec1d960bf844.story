Ed Miliband must work harder to get his message across to the public if Labour is to recover from a 'shaky start' to 2012, senior Labour MP Alan Johnson warned.

The former cabinet minister said he believed the party leader had 'the personality, the intellect and the steely determination to succeed'.

But he said that unless he got out 'on the stump' to gain public recognition and made the Opposition sound more relevant to ordinary voters it would be in trouble.

The intervention of Mr Johnson, who stepped down as shadow chancellor almost a year ago for personal reasons, comes after a damning poll showed most voters not think that Mr Miliband is doing a worse job than Nick Clegg.

Under pressure: Most think Ed Miliband, left, is not performing well as Labour leader and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, right, is not that popular either

The YouGov survey found that just 20 
per cent of people say Mr Miliband is performing well as Labour leader, 
while 21 per cent think the same of Mr Clegg as leader of the Liberal 
Democrats, despite his party’s unpopularity.

By contrast, 44 per cent of people think David Cameron is doing well as Prime Minister.

The findings – the worst for Mr 
Miliband since he defeated his brother David for the Labour crown – came
as MPs began to suggest publicly that he needs to 'get a grip'.

One of the party’s most senior figures
said yesterday that the Labour leader had yet to develop a 'credible 
and compelling' economic position.

Former chancellor Alistair Darling – touted as a potential caretaker leader – said Labour has a 'lot more to do'.

The poll rounded off Mr Miliband’s 
worst week – one in which his own policy guru Lord Glasman admitted the 
party had 'no strategy, no narrative and little energy' under his 
leadership and his spin chief Tom Baldwin was forced to reject 
comparisons with Iain Duncan Smith.

Labour frontbencher Diane Abbott gave 
him a fresh headache with a racism row after she attacked white people 
for liking to 'divide and rule'.

And it was compounded by the party 
leader himself when he accidentally referred to ‘Blackbusters’ in a 
comment on the death of Blockbusters host Bob Holness.

Mr Johnson wrote in The Mirror that it
was a 'pivotal year' for Labour, which he said is in 'good shape' but 
was not getting its message across. 

“Small opinion poll leads, welcome as 
they are, cannot hide the fact that the public remain suspicious about 
Labour,' said Mr Johnson.

'A long way to go': Alistair Darling said that it wasn't true to say Mr Miliband wasn't having an impact, but that more work was required

That was not helped by 'unfortunate 
comments by people who profess their support for the leader they are 
busily undermining', he said - in a swipe at Lord Glasman.

But Mr Johnson conceded that the 
leadership was not helping itself by failing to present its policies 
effectively and too often sounding like a 'debating society' or 
'university seminar'.

'At the moment Labour is like a pearl 
stuck firmly inside an oyster. Inside there’s a gem but the public can 
only see the shell,' he wrote.

'In my view, Ed Miliband has the 
personality, the intellect and the steely determination to succeed - to 
set out a vision for a better society, to formulate a clear message and 
to face up to the difficult priorities that will need to be set.'

But that required 'a better grip on 
messaging, including over who speaks and when', he added, and 
recognition by shadow ministers that they had to offer a 'credible 
alternative” as well as criticising the coalition.

'The leader must be the authentic 
voice and should be the public face of the Labour Party. That means 
going out on the stump, constantly identifying those issues which 
resonate with the public, and hammering home Labour’s message,' he 
concluded.

'We cannot get to 2015 and an election with the public and the media asking the question: Who is Ed Miliband?'

Mr Miliband will tomorrow make a 
speech on the economy in what is being seen as a relaunch of his 
faltering leadership. He is expected to insist that Labour accepts the 
need for austerity and must ‘come to terms’ with the fact that it cannot
repeat the politics of the New Labour years, focused on ever-higher 
public spending.

Mr Darling said it was ‘simply not 
true’ to say that Mr Miliband was not having an impact. 'Obviously we’ve
got a lot more to do; we’ve got to restore our reputation for economic 
credibility,’ he added.

‘We’ve got a long way to go. We need to be further ahead in the polls.'

In remarks that will be seen as a 
swipe at Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls, who insists the Government should 
borrow more money to mitigate austerity, Mr Darling added: 'What we do 
need to do is to establish a credible and compelling position on the 
economy.

'We need to be clear about our values,
what sort of country we want to see, where jobs are going to come from 
in an increasingly difficult world.'

Bookmakers yesterday halved the odds 
on Mr Darling becoming the next Labour leader to 25/1, but he insisted: 
'I’m a backbench Labour MP, I’m happy to serve there.'

Blairite MPs were instead said to be 
ready to join Brownites in backing Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper 
as leader if Mr Miliband goes.

Some apparently believe the party has 
no chance at the next Election and David Miliband could return as leader
only after another candidate has tried and failed to regain power.

Labour MP Graham Stringer attacked Mr Miliband for failing to sack Miss Abbott last week, adding: 'Ed has got to get a grip.'

And Birmingham MP Roger Godsiff said: 
'We need fresh thinking and to break with the old order economically. 
And we must do it with people who are credible with the electorate.'

A former senior Labour adviser urged 
Mr Miliband to embark on 'a far bigger and blunter conversation' about 
spending choices facing the country.

Gavin Kelly, a deputy chief of staff 
to Gordon Brown, said Labour could not dodge difficult choices on the 
deficit with vague assertions that spending will have to be constrained 
for at least a decade.

But Labour business spokesman Chuka 
Umunna said it was 'absolutely ridiculous' to suggest Mr Miliband would 
not be leader in a year’s time.

He said Labour had 60,000 more members
since Mr Miliband took the helm, though that figure is in doubt since 
thousands are also thought to have left and half of the party’s 
membership is now said to be made up of teachers.

Told that he was now second favourite 
to take over as leader, after Miss Cooper, according to bookmakers, Mr 
Umunna declared: 'Oh for God’s sake!'
