A Paris court ruled Friday in favor of a French auction house that plans to sell dozens of Native American tribal masks despite pleas from Arizona’s Hopi people, friends to the tribe like actor Robert Redford, and even from the U.S. government.

After a saga  that began around a century ago, these intricate masks—which are fed and nurtured by the Hopi like the living dead—will be auctioned off to the highest bidder worlds away from where they began their journey in the deserts of Arizona.

The potentially landmark decision with transatlantic repercussions means the sale can go ahead at Drouot auction house Friday afternoon, giving a rare glimpse of the ornate masks and headdresses to the European crowd.

Ancient: Despite pleas from the Hopi people of Arizona that considers them sacred, 70 ancient masks and headdresses were OK'd for sale by a French court Friday

The Hopi Indians insist the masks, known as 'katsinam' are spiritual vessels that date back to the late 19th century and early 20th century were stolen from a northern Arizona reservation in the 1930s and 1940s.

Numbering nearly 20,000, many remaining Hopi still lead a traditional way of life on three isolated Arizona mesas and believe the masks carry with them the spirit of divine messenger.

The auctioneer argued that blocking the sale would have tremendous implications and potentially force French museums to empty their collections

‘This decision is very disappointing since the masks will be sold and dispersed,’ said the tribe's French lawyer, Pierre Servan-Schreiber, outside the courtroom.

‘The Hopi tribe will be extremely 
saddened by the decision,’ he said. ‘Especially since the judgment 
recognizes that these masks have a sacred value. The judge considers 
that the imminent damage (to the masks) is not sufficiently strong.’

Sacred: The antique masks like the 'Hemiskatsinmana,' left, and 'Angwusnasomtaqa,' right, will be auctioned off Friday afternoon in Paris, worlds away from their Arizona origins, where the Hopi say they were stolen in the 1930s and 1940s

American ambassador to France Charles Rivkin expressed his disappointment over Friday’s ruling after writing a letter to the French government Thursday that urged the sale be suspended due to the ‘importance of these sacred objects to the Hopi Nation.’

The Hopis' lawyers have filed a request with the Council of Sales, the French auction market authority, to suspend the sale, he added.

A spokeswoman for the Council of Sales declined immediate comment.

Criminal: Actor Robert Redford, a 'friend' to the Hopi, decried the sale as a 'criminal gesture' with 'grave moral consequences'

Divine: Hopi say the masks, like the pictured 'Acoma,' are imbued with divine spirits and treat them as the 'living dead'

Gilles Neret-Minet, of the Neret-Minet Tessier & Sarrou auction house behind the auction, said he would stop short of any triumphalism over the ruling, ‘but I'm happy that French law was respected.’

‘I am also very concerned about the Hopis' sadness, but you cannot break property law,’ he said. ‘These are in (private) collections in Europe: they are no longer sacred.’

Neret-Minet said the auction house has received ‘serious threats’ ahead of the auction.

Indignant: The Paris auction house where the masks will be auctioned Friday called the masks 'no longer sacred'

Worth it? The striking masks of wood, horsehair, leather, and feathers are expected to fetch upwards of $66,000

Last week, in an interview with Indian 
Country Today Media Network, Neret-Minet was emphatic in his belief that
 the objects' meaning had little sway for him or France.

'France is a country of rights! All the mail in the world will not change anything,' he said. 'Those masks are only sacred when used in a dance. They are not sacred afterward.'

The 70 objects, mainly Hopi, went on display at Druout for the first time as the court battle kicked off Thursday.

Unheeded: Outcries over the sale of the masks (pictured are the 'Sio Hemis Cachina,' left, and 'Tasavu,' right) were heard Thursday and Friday from the U.S. ambassador to France, two American museums, as well as the Hopi people

The masks are undoubtedly striking — surreal faces made from wood, leather, horse hair and feathers — and painted in vivid pigments of red, blue, yellow and orange. Hopi representatives contend the items were stolen at some point, and wanted the auction house to prove otherwise. They say the masks have a special status and are more than art, representing their dead ancestors' spirits.

Disputes over art ownership, demands for restitution, and arguments over whether sacred objects should be sold are nothing new.

Take the continuing row between the British Museum and Greece over the Elgin marbles, which Scottish diplomat Lord Elgin removed from the Parthenon in the 19th century. Greece wants them back; but opponents fear that would open the floodgates, forcing Western museums to send home thousands of artifacts.
