A mother-of-two has revealed her terror on waking up to find herself swimming in a deep river after she went sleepwalking in the middle of the night.

Alyson Bair, 31, suffers from a severe form of the condition which she believes is made worse by stress brought on by the diagnosis of a chronic illness.

On August 20, her husband Cody woke at 2am to discover his wife was not in bed and a sliding glass open at the family home in Burley, Idaho.

Nightmare scenario: Married mother-of-two Alyson Bair was found on an Idaho riverbank after sleepwalking into a river last week

A frantic search began involving the local sheriff and a neighbor on a jet ski who covered the Snake River close to their home in Cassia County.

Five hours later, Mrs Bair was found
on a riverbank a quarter of a mile from home. Her pyjamas were soaking wet and she was suffering
from hypothermia with cuts and bruises on her bare feet.

She was
taken to Cassia Regional Medical Center by ambulance and later released.

Mrs Bair told ABCNews: 'I thought I was dreaming, but then I realized I wasn't and I was scared.

'It was deep and I couldn't touch anywhere and I was getting tired. I had to keep turning around and floating on my back.'

The mother said the sleepwalking terrifies her because she 'doesn't know what she could do'.

The
Bairs have a son, eight, and four-year-old daughter. The first time 
that she went sleepwalking, it was her son that discovered his mother 
was missing.

Medicines and guns at the family home have been locked up and her husband has installed alarms on all outside doors to which she doesn't know the codes.

The night she managed to get out, the family had left the doors open because of the hot weather. 

Mrs Bair has been diagnosed with a 
chronic auto-immune disease called Sjogren's syndrome where a person's 
white blood cells attack their moisture-producing glands.

She
said that the condition has caused her joint pain, fatigue and mild 
issues with her kidneys. Although she takes two medications, sleeping 
tablets were not one of them.

The 31-year-old admitted that since 
being told she had Sjogren's syndrome she had felt depressed and doctors
said stress could exacerbate the sleepwalking.

Mrs Bair has also suffered from night terrors since she was a child which she now takes medication for.

She added: 'I haven't been injured seriously besides the hypothermia, thank goodness…I'm just worried about what could happen.'

Mrs Bair has a history of sleep swimming - authorities have responded to three incidents in the past six weeks.

According to a Cassia County 
Sheriff's 
report, deputies found her one other time soaking wet 
in Burley after apparently swimming in the river. After the latest 
incident, a county judge issued an order to have her mental health 
checked - but she was not found to be a danger to herself or others.

A deputy told the woman's husband she needed to seek help as the temperatures 
will soon drop, posing a greater danger.

Alyson Bair appeared to have been suffering from a particularly severe form of somnambulism, or sleepwalking.

It typically occurs when people are in deep sleep early in the night, but does not take place during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, which is the time when eyes move quickly and vivid dreaming is common.

Sleepwalking occurs when normal physiological systems are active when they're not supposed to be. Scientists are still puzzling out why the brain issues commands to muscles during certain sleep phases, but do know the commands are usually suppressed by other brain mechanisms. For some people however, this suppression is not fully recognised - due to genetic or environmental factors.

The sleepwalker cannot respond during the incident, even though their eyes are open, and often won't remember it. If they are awoken, they will be disorientated for a short time.

The cause is generally unknown, but it is believed to be genetic. Aggravating environmental factors are fatigue, a lack of sleep, fever stress and alcohol or drug use.
