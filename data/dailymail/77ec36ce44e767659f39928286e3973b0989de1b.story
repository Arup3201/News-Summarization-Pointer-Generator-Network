David Cameron is preparing to issue a grovelling apology to the Queen in person after claiming she 'purred' when Scots rejected independence.

It is understood the Prime Minister will say sorry in his weekly audience at Buckingham Palace tonight.

Mr Cameron is said to be 'very embarrassed' about the gaffe, after he broke protocol to divulge the private conversations with the head of state.

The Queen, pictured at Buckingham Palace today, will hold her weekly audience with Prime Minister David Cameron tomorrow, when he will apologise for discussing her reaction to the Scottish independence referendim

In a separate gaffe, Mr Cameron told Tory MPs about a private conversations with the Queen during a visit to Chequers earlier this year

Mr Cameron was left red-faced after being caught on camera revealing details of his conversations with the Queen over Scotland.

On a visit to New York last month, the PM was filmed boasting to former mayor Michael Bloomberg about the call he made to the Queen at Balmoral.

As the Prime Minister and Mr Bloomberg arrived for a press photo-opportunity, Mr Cameron smiled broadly as he recalled how he was able to tell the Queen it was 'all right' after the referendum resulted in a victory for the No camp.

'The definition of relief, if you are Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, is ringing up Her Majesty the Queen and saying 'Your Majesty, it is all right, it's okay',' Mr Cameron said.

'That was something. She purred down the line.'

Last week Mr Cameron vowed 'never again' to discuss his conversations with the Queen after being challenged whether he was ashamed to have been overheard saying she had 'purred' when told the result of the Scottish independence referendum.

He told BBC One's Andrew Marr show: '(It is) one of those moments when you look back and kick yourself very hard.

'It was not a conversation I should have had, I am extremely sorry and very embarrassed about it.

'I have made my apologies and I think I'll probably be making some more.'

Asked if he felt ashamed, the Prime Minister added: 'I'm very sorry about it... I'm not going to ever discuss my conversations with the Palace ever again.' 

In an extraordinary sequence, David Cameron was today heard talking about the moment he rang the Queen at Balmoral to give her the news about the vote

Despite being just feet from the cameras, Mr Cameron appears to have had no qualms about being so indiscreet about his private discussions with the head of state

In the video recording, David Cameron could clearly be heard discussing his private conversations with the Queen. He said: 

'The definition of relief is being the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and ringing the Queen and saying 'It's alright, it's okay'. That was something....

'She purred down the line...

'But it should never have been that close.

'It wasn't in the end, but there was a time in the middle of the campaign when it felt…

'I've said I want to find these polling companies and I want to sue them for my stomach ulcers because of what they put me through.

'It was very nervous moments.'

But it later emerged that Mr Cameron had breached protocol a second time, after allegedly cracking a joke with Tory MPs at Her Majesty's expense.

It was revealed that Mr Cameron told a gathering of top Tories how the monarch once had to be corrected for wrongly claiming that she owned the real version of a painting hanging in the PM's country retreat – when in fact she was looking at the original.

The Prime Minister told the story to a group of Tories invited to Chequers in the wake of the Scottish referendum.

But  it was confirmed later that the Queen was right all along about the painting. The portraits by Van Dyck are in the Royal Collection, owned by the Queen, art experts said.

After the first gaffe in New York, Downing Street contacted Buckingham Palace to offer the Prime Minister's apologies.

However, with the Queen on holiday in Scotland and then the onset of the party conference season, Mr Cameron has not yet made peace in person. 

After a bitter two-year campaign, 55 per cent of people in Scotland voted to remain part of the United Kingdom.

It mean that First Minister Alex Salmond resigned, announcing hours after the result was declared that he would be stepping down in November.

Mr Cameron has previously said his weekly meetings with the Queen help him to ‘sort out the problems’ in his own head – but doubts she gets much out of it.

The Prime Minister said that after 60 years on the throne, the Queen has ‘literally heard it all before’. 

Prime Ministers are granted an ‘audience’ with the monarch every week, when Parliament is sitting, to update the head of state on the major issues the country faces.
