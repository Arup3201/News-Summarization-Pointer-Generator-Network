Couples tying the knot can meticulously plan their wedding down to the smallest detail, from the colour of the chair decorations to the timing of the first dance.

But while you can more-or-less guarantee everything will be flawless on the big day, there is one vital exception - the weather.

However, a travel company is now offering a ‘perfect day’ package – including control over the weather – for an eye-watering £100,000.

Travel Company Oliver's Travels is offering a wedding package that claims to be able to control the weather. It employs a 'cloud bursting' service - a technique that involves firing rockets filled with silver iodide crystals into rain clouds from light aircraft

Oliver’s Travels says its ‘cloud bursting’ service will guarantee blue skies on the special day.

Staffed by a team of highly-specialised meteorologists and pilots, the company are able to fly a light aircraft above the clouds, sprinkling them with silver particles which cause the clouds to burst and vanish in time for the ceremony.

Otherwise known as cloud seeding, the technique involves firing rockets filled with silver iodide crystals into rain clouds from light aircraft or the ground.

The icy particles freeze water droplets so that they continue growing in size and eventually fall out of the cloud as snow which turns to rain before it reaches the ground.

However, the method only works on small or medium-sized clouds and there are also environmental concerns about using silver iodide.

Cloud-seeding is used around the world to prevent fog at airports, stop hail damage in cities or to boost snowfall at ski resorts.

The luxury travel company, which organises destination weddings st stately homes and castles in England, France and Italy as well as beach weddings in the Caribbean, has introduced the new service for its most high-end customers.

The technique was developed in 1940s Russia so that the weather would not disturb Soviet rallies, and new technology and research have produced reliable results that make cloud seeding a dependable activity.

It is now considered a mainstream tool and it has become a tradition in China to ‘seed’ clouds before public holidays to induce rain, disperse pollution and ensure clear blue skies.

This involved firing rockets packed with silver iodide crystals into rain clouds over the suburbs of Beijing.

It was also reportedly used by Paul McCartney at one of his gigs in 2003, and at the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s wedding in 2012.

Oliver Bell, Co-Founder of Oliver’s Travels commented: ‘We pride ourselves on our quirky approach, and are thrilled to be able to offer such an unusual, unique service to our customers, to ensure their wedding is the talk of the town.’ 

In recent years, Chinese air force jets have flown more than 3,000 flights and sowed rain-making chemicals to bring down 210 billion cubic metres of water over three million square kilometres, nearly a third of China's territory.

The technique is regularly used to boost rainfall in drought-stricken areas of China.

It is also possible to ‘over nucleate’ clouds with many particles so that they hold in their moisture until they have passed over the target area, experts say.

Musician Paul McCartney is once said to have spent £22,000 on three jets to fire dry ice into clouds hovering over St Petersburg ahead of an open-air gig.

However, thirty-five deaths in the 1952 Lynmouth flood disaster were linked at the time to RAF rain-making experiments over southern England a few days earlier, although nothing was proved.

One company said they had been contacted by a major British music festival about the possibility of cloud seeding but when the complexities were explained to the organisers and the fact that 'we could not provide any guarantee that we could make it not rain; they decided against it.

Steve Hilton, David Cameron's former Director of Strategy, reportedly floated the idea of buying in cloud-bursting technology to extend the British summer.

The policy guru believed a sunnier climate would make us all happier and more productive.

However, the idea was dismissed as crazy by fellow Westminster aides.
