Garth Brooks is a real country gentleman when it comes to keeping his word.

He’s making good on a promise he made to wife Trisha Yearwood eight years ago, to move from the couple’s country mansion in Owasso, Oklahoma, back to Nashville once his youngest child graduated from high school.

And he’s just put their $3.5 million home up for sale!

We're outta here: Garth Brooks is a man of his word. He promised wife Trisha they would move back to Tennessee after his daughters had graduated from high school. And so they are

When Brooks, 52, and his 49 year old Misses married December 10, 2005 he was a divorced dad with three young daughters.

Garth and Trisha wanted to make their home in Tennessee, but when his ex wife Sandy Mahl moved the kids from Georgia to Oklahoma, he knew he and Trisha had to follow.

‘Although Garth and Sandy divorced after 15 years of marriage, Garth continued to put his girls first,’ says a source. ‘He adores his children, and there was no way he wasn’t going to be a part of his daughter’s lives on a daily basis.

Trisha just didn’t know how they could live in Oklahoma and still manage their careers, which centered around the music industry in Nashville.  But Garth was adamant that he needed to be near his children in Owasso.

For sale: Garth's girls spent a lot of time at thea 14,089 square foot French country style mansion on 2.4 acres of land in Owasso, Oklahoma

The source reveals Garth wanted so much to be with his girls, that he made Trish a deal. He said that if she would agree to move up north with him until the girls were all out of High School, he would agree to move back to Tennesse.

Garth is Yearwood’s third husband. She was married to Chris Latham from 1987-1991 and on May 21, 1994, she married guitar player Bobby Reynolds, but they divorced in 1999.

‘Trisha never felt either of her first two marriages was strong enough to have children,’ says the source. ‘And when she and Garth finally married in 2005, after four years of dating, she found she didn't get pregnant, so they never had children of their own.

‘Garth and Trisha did talk about adopting,’ adds the source, ‘but in the end they agreed that it was enough to parent Garth’s three girls together.'

State of the art: Besides a huge kitchen, Garth's house boasts seven bedrooms and 9.5 baths. The asking price is $3,490,000

The source says Trisha is extremely close to the girls, including 21 year old Taylor, who Trisha taught to cook, Allie, 17 and 19 year old August who just made Garth a Grandfather when she and her boyfriend welcomed a baby girl they named Karolynn.

'Trisha has always gotten along great with Garth’s girls,' adds the source. 'Garth decided to retire shortly after his divorce from his wife so he could spend more time with the girls.  And after the move to Oklahoma, the girls lived part time with their mom and part time with Garth and Trisha.’

The home the girls shared with their dad and step – mom, which is now for sale,  had plenty of room for the Brooks family of five! It is a 14,089 square foot French country style mansion on 2.4 acres of land in Owasso, Oklahoma. It has 7 bedrooms and 9.5 baths, and the asking price is $3,490,000. It also has 2 kitchens, a 5 car garage, a screening room and a gym.

‘Of course the girls loved living in the lap of luxury with Trish and Garth, so they were always happy to arrive on their doorstep!’

Adieu: Ex-wife Sandy Mahl, the mom of Garth's daughters Allie, 17, August,19, and Taylor, 21, will remain in Oklahoma

But now that Allie will be graduating next month, Garth is ready to make good on his promise to return to Tennessee.

Garth just put the Oklahoma house up for sale and he and Trisha have already started looking for a new property near their old place in Goodlettsville, Tennessee. They still want enough room so the girls can visit anytime.’

Garth has also decided to start touring again after 14 years

‘Garth is coming out of retirement now that Allie is graduating High school,’ says the source. ‘He wanted to be around while the girls were growing up, but now that they will all basically be on their own, he feels free to travel. In fact, he’ll star touring in September, and Trisha plans to spend time on the road with him promising to jump up on stage every once in a while and duo with him!’
