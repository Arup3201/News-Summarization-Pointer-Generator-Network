Every home in the country will have to cope with compulsory rubbish recycling schemes by next year, according to papers released by ministers yesterday.

Instructions prepared for councils have revealed a move to bring in separate collections of paper, metal, plastic and glass in order to meet recycling targets set by Brussels.

This will mean that many homes will need more bins and any local councils which have clung to traditional weekly bin rounds – there are thought to be around 100 in England and Wales – will have to establish compulsory recycling systems.

Ministers have laid out plans for all  households to have multiple recycling systems for glass, paper and metal

Although some of the materials can be collected in the same bins, documents prepared by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) explain that this can rarely be done for glass – and claim that in other cases separate bins will often prove ‘necessary’.

The push for multi-bin rubbish collection systems follows new figures which show that the amount of household refuse successfully sent for recycling is now going down rather than up.

The statistics, which were released yesterday by Defra, show that in September last year the recycling rate of waste from households was 43.9 per cent – down from 44.1 per cent the year before.

A spokesman for Defra said: ‘We are working to ensure we meet an EU target to recycle 50 per cent of household waste.

‘Everyone has a role to play and we want local authorities working with waste management companies to make it as easy for people to recycle as possible.’

But Doretta Cocks, a spokesman for the Campaign for Weekly Waste Collections, said: ‘The Government has been going in the wrong direction. They are going to struggle to meet the target.

‘People are resentful. A lot of people don’t bother to recycle properly now. They say that if the council isn’t bothered to collect the rubbish once a week, then I’m not bothered about recycling properly.’

But Brussels has set a target for 50% of waste to be recycled

An earlier version of this article wrongly said that Brussels had set a target of 50% of waste to be recycled per home. In fact, as the sub-heading now makes clear, the target is for 50% of the total amount of waste to be recycled.
