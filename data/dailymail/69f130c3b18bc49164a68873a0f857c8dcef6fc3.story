There will not be posters commemorating this victory in the match-day programme next week and the travelling fans are unlikely to have their ticket prices refunded. But this victory over a solid Stoke side was every bit as important as last week’s 8-0 thrashing of Sunderland.

It lifts Southampton to an unlikely second in the table after nine games, two points clear of reigning champions Manchester City. It also extends the best defensive record in all four tiers of English football, with just five goals conceded and only one of those at St Mary’s.

‘This win was more difficult than last week and maybe even nicer,’ said manager Ronald Koeman.

‘It will be nice to enjoy the table on Sunday and it’s good for the fans to see but on Monday we go back to work. The clean sheet is very important.’

Not many would have predicted such smooth sailing on the south coast after the mass exodus of players in the summer. But Graziano Pelle, Dusan Tadic and Toby Alderweireld have proved rich assets in the absence of Adam Lallana, Ricky Lambert and Dejan Lovren.

‘We deserved the win,’ said Koeman. ‘The lads showed great ambition and in the first half we were even better than last week. Maybe people are not surprised any more about our qualities.’

Since joining Southampton after the departure of Mauricio Pochettino, it seems Koeman can do no wrong. The one change he made after that decimation of Sunderland was bringing Saido Mane into the starting line up. The Senegalese midfielder repaid the favour, tormenting Phil Bardsley down the left flank before putting the Saints ahead on 33 minutes.

Mane, 22, had his first Premier League goal scored against Sunderland last week harshly taken from him by the dubious goals panel. There can be no doubt about this one. He leapt onto the rebound after Pelle’s shot ricocheted off the post and fired powerfully past Asmir Begovic.

Southampton recaptured the invention and vigour of last Saturday’s historic victory and within 10 minutes had recorded five shots on target.

Pelle and Tadic, who played against each other in the Dutch league last season, linked up as if they have been team-mates for years and Mane fitted in seamlessly. Bought from Salzburg for £11.8million, he collected the ball from outside the box in the third minute and curled in a useful cross which Pelle strained for but could not reach.

Stoke squandered chances in the opening stages. Peter Crouch headed wide from a promising Steven N’Zonzi cross. Then the talented Victor Moses made a mazy run into the box but could not muster an end product, his weak attempt easily saved by Fraser Forster. Ryan Shawcross was also unfortunate to be booked by referee Jon Moss for changing his boots on the pitch.

Stoke substitute Mame Biram Diouf had their best chance to level proceedings when supplied with a brilliant cross by Bardsley, however, his right-footed shot from very close range missed to the left of the target.

‘If he makes contact then possibly we could have taken something out of the game,’ said Stoke manager Mark Hughes,

'From our point of view, we're a little bit disappointed with the first half, really.

'We didn't really ask enough questions of Southampton, made it a little bit too easy, showed them a little too much respect, I would suggest, which is understandable to a certain extent given their exploits last time out here.

'I think that was the case in the first half. They caused us a few problems at set plays and obviously from one of the ones we didn't deal with it dropped handily for them and they've been able to dispatch the winning goal.

'Second half, I thought we were a lot better. We made a change very early on, got Mame Diouf on, and that gave us a threat in behind and that stretched the game.

'It allowed us to control of the game and in the second half I thought we were the better side, but we never really created those clear-cut chances we need to get back on level terms.'
