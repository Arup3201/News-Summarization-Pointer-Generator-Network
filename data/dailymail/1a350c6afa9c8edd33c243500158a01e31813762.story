Teasmade alarm clock machines which make a cup of tea ready for rising were once household staples.

They came with good points (a fresh cup of tea, ready made) and bad ones (that awful screeching alarm sound). Their appeal was long-lived and lasted from the 1930s to the 1970s.

And now, one London-based designer hopes to reignite the nation's love of hot beverage-making alarm clocks with his slick design dubbed the Barisieur.

Joshua Renouf's charming creation is an alarm clock that is also a coffee-maker.

It's designed to wake the user up gently with the sound of clinking ball bearings - which are used to boil water through induction heating - and the smell of freshly brewed coffee.

Unlike traditional blaring alarm clocks - or indeed the screech of a teasmade - the sound emitted from a Barisieur is said to be soothing, easing the sleeper into their day with the
 subtle movement and sound of the stainless steel balls.

Josh hopes to get the product on shelves nationally as soon as possible, for an estimated retail price of £200

The innovative machine requires the user to prepare the device for the next morning before going to bed.

Users need to clean and refill beans, sugar and milk, something Joshua hopes will subliminally signal to the body and mind that it's time to relax.

The Barisieur features a coffee maker and attached alarm clock, which makes coffee ready for as soon as you wakes up, so you can either sip it in bed or drink on the go.

Joshua, a young Nottingham Trent University graduate, is being inundated with consumers requesting the product but is only just getting in touch with manufacturers, he tells MailOnline.

'I was looking at teasmades and they're basically quite ugly and there really bulky,' he says.

'What
 we're hoping to do with out product is encourage a routine before going
 to bed, slow people down and get them off their tablets and iPhones.'
