When Andrew Taylor was alerted to a thief making a run for it with two stolen laptops he could have dialled 999 or pretended not to have noticed.

But instead he doggedly pursued the suspect through the streets for over a mile in his bare feet before cornering him.

The determined 18-year-old college student ran so fast and over such gruelling terrain that his feet were left ‘shredded’ by the 15-minute chase and resembled ‘lumps of sirloin steak’.

The brave teenager, who suffers from 
cystic fibrosis, later spent months on crutches and has undergone 
intensive physiotherapy to begin walking again.

But
 his ‘public-spirited’ efforts were yesterday praised by a judge as the 
career criminal he refused to let get away was locked up for four years.

He ran his foot, literally, to the bone, the court was told.

Last night, the teenager shrugged off his heroic intervention and told how he thought only of catching the culprit.

‘It was just adrenalin, really,’ he said. ‘I didn’t even think about not having shoes on. It was just automatic.

‘My dad shouted for help to chase him, so I did.

‘I had no idea about the state of my feet until my dad pointed it out.

‘I looked down and couldn’t believe it. That’s when it started to hurt. I hobbled home and my dad continued the chase.’

Serial offender John Kirk, aged 43, who has more than 216 previous offences, was jailed for four years for the burglary

His
 father, Paul Taylor, said: ‘I don’t know how he kept going. Both of his
 feet were shredded. They were like lumps of sirloin steak.’

Mr Taylor, a 56-year-old salesman, 
said he had been standing talking to his neighbour when he and his son 
became embroiled in the drama in March this year.

The
 father-of-three said they saw 43-year-old heroin addict John Kirk run 
round the corner - followed soon after by the burglary victim.

Kirk
 had struck moments earlier at a home in an adjoining street in 
Darlington, County Durham, and had been disturbed by the householder who
 gave chase, the court was told.

The homeowner managed to corner Kirk but the raider shoved him out of the way and fled with the two computers in bags.

Mr Taylor said: ‘A man came running into the close, and to all intents and purposes it looked like he was out jogging.

‘But a few seconds later, a taxi came screeching up after him. I thought it was someone running away from a fare.

‘The
 guy (in the taxi) shouted ‘he’s robbed my house and stole my lap-top’, 
so I gave chase with the taxi driver and shouted my son to help.

‘We chased him for about ten minutes and when Andrew flushed him out of a garden, I realised he had nothing on his feet.

‘Andrew chased him so far but then started limping badly and I saw his feet. The soles were shredded, almost to the bone.’

Kirk, who has an astonishing 216 previous convictions, was eventually stopped minutes later at a shopping parade.

Kirk, of High Northgate, Darlington, denied burglary but was convicted after a trial and was jailed for four years.

He claimed he had been given the computer bags by the fleeing raider and simply ran off when he was challenged.

Teesside Crown Court heard how a lanyard with Kirk’s prison ID badge and a key sharpened to a point were found near the scene.

Unemployed Kirk had been freed from Holme House Prison in Stockton shortly before the burglary on March 26.

The judge, Recorder Simon Phillips, QC, awarded Andrew £250 from public funds for heroically pursuing Kirk through the streets.

He
 said: ‘Andrew and his father showed tremendous public-spiritedness in 
assisting in endeavouring to stop the burglar in his tracks.

‘I have seen the photograph showing the flesh that came away from the ball of Andrew Taylor’s foot, exposing the bone.

‘He suffered very painful consequences from his well-intentioned involvement. He ran his foot, literally, to the bone.

‘I direct the Taylors should be written a letter of commendation by way of a small token of appreciation of their civic duty.’

The judge said Kirk had devastated the lives of the couple he stole from. They are now uneasy in their own home, he added.

He said he had been convicted on ‘overwhelming’ evidence which showed he had also been earlier sizing up the house.

Christopher
 Morrison, defending, said Kirk was in danger of becoming 
institutionalised because he had spent so little time at liberty.

But he told the judge that he hoped to be able to reintegrate into society when he is released from his latest jail sentence.

‘His record is little less than a litany of what has so far been a wasted life,’ he told the court.
