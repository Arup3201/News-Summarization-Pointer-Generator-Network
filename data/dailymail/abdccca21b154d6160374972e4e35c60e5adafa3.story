A father has been reunited with his son, 46 years after he was made to give the boy up for adoption.

The emotional meeting between Greg, a 64-year-old trainer and body builder, and Wendell, now 46, took place on Tuesday's episode of Dr Phil, having been masterminded by professional locator Troy Dunn.

Greg told the TV host: 'It's important to me for him to know that I never abandoned him. I always wanted him.'

Warm embrace: Greg, 64, was reunited with his 46-year-old son Wendell (L) during Tuesday’s episode of Dr Phil

He teared up as Wendell appeared onstage, and, while embracing his son for the first time, he exclaimed: 'My son, oh my God - you are one handsome young man.'

Wendell had plenty of warm words for his father, telling him: 'First of all, I'm glad to know that someone was looking for me. I want you to know that I have no feelings of resentment, or sense of abandonment, or anything like that.

'On the contrary I want to actually thank you for making the decision that you did, whether it was your decision or not. The parents that I got were two of the most wonderful people on the planet and I couldn't have asked for better parents to raise me.'

Wendell only had one pressing question for his dad: whether Greg, who was 18 at the time, was involved in the process of placing him with his adoptive parents.

Greg quickly explained that it was actually the parents of Wendell's mother who insisted on giving him up, adding that he and his family fought to try and keep him with them.

'Your mother came from a wealthy family,' Greg said. 'We were relatively poor.'

'When she became pregnant, it became obvious that her mother kept her under wraps - sent her to a home for unwed mothers, wouldn't let her walk in the neighborhood, except at midnight, because she didn't want the neighbors to find out that she was pregnant.'

Greg's father threw his college scholarships away and instructed him to begin working the day he graduated from high school. He found a job at Rohr Aircraft and was prepared to abandon his dreams of continuing his education.

'My father said: "There's no such thing as illegitimate children, just illegitimate parents." And that stuck with me my whole life.' he added.

When Wendell was born, Greg was not allowed at the hospital. His name didn't even appear on Wendell's birth certificate, as he had expected it to.

Greg's girlfriend's family then informed him that they were giving the child up.

'My mother had fought to take custody,' he recalls. 'This was her first grandson, and she wanted that child; she wanted you.'

'They had more money, they had more power, and they just did it. And I was sick and I didn't know what to do, and I was lost.'

Greg went on to enroll at a junior college, where he played football, but still thought of the baby boy over the years.

'You never, ever left the back of my mind or my heart,' he said.
