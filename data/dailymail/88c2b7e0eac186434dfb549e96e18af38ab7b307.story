An artist is dedicating his life’s work to painting a portrait of every person living in his home city - all 1,800 of them.

Grahame Hurd-Wood, 55, has already spent 14 years producing pictures of people in St Davids in Wales - which is Britain's smallest city. 

He has painted oil portraits of everyone from its councillors and bishops to children, housewives and students.

Talented: Grahame Hurd-Wood has already spent 14 years producing paintings of people in St Davids

Mr Hurd-Wood has finished 112 paintings but believes he can complete the remaining 1,688 in a decade if he paints them at a rate of one every two days.

He has spent the past 30 years living in the Pembrokeshire city - Britain’s smallest in both size and population and reputably the second smallest in the world.

His labour of love began as a hobby but after painting dozens of friends and family he decided to keep going until he has captured every last resident.

Eventually Mr Hurd-Wood plans to merge them all together as one giant panorama capturing all walks of life.

He said: 'I began painting residents in St Davids around 14 years ago. The original concept was to paint a few people and then put the portraits together as one large image.

'But after I painted just over 100 portraits I thought if I concentrate more it would be possible to paint the whole city.

'St Davids is a very special place and a unique city. People from all walks of life integrate and live alongside one another.

'I have been accepted into the community and I love it here - this is my way of paying tribute to the place I call home.'

Mr Hurd-Wood says each small portrait can take between 45 minutes and four hours but so far every single resident he’s asked has been happy to sit for him.

His youngest subject to date was four-year-old Erin Dauncey, while the oldest was 85-year-old Klaus Trier.

Mr Hurd-Wood, who trained at Camberwell College of Arts and the Royal Academy of Arts, is traditionally a landscape artist who works predominantly in oils.

He’s calling his mammoth project 'City of Portraits'.

Mr Hurd-Wood said: 'Once I’ve completed the whole collection I’ll have an exhibition in St Davids where everyone who I have painted can come and see the paintings as one collection.

'I tend to approach people to see if they would be happy to sit, but occasionally someone will ask for me to do a portrait of them.

'Most people are intrigued and really positive about it. I do every portrait from a sitting so each one is personalised. It’s nice to have the time to get to know that individual a little better.

'When it’s finished it will look from a distance like one giant piece of work. But when you look closer you will be able to see each individual’s portrait and identity.

'The collection is an eclectic viewpoint which reflects the diversity of the whole city from all walks of life.'

St Davids was given city status in the 16th century due to the presence of St David’s Cathedral but lost it in 1888, only to see it restored in 1994 at the request of Queen Elizabeth II.

David Lloyd, 68, a barrister who has lived there all his life, said: 'Grahame’s amazing collection is a striking snapshot of the community that I belong to and where I have been all my life.'
