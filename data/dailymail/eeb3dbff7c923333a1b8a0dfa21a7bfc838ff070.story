Two senior journalists at the Sun newspaper walked free from court yesterday after being cleared of paying public officials for stories.

The paper's picture editor John Edwards, 50, wept as he and former reporter John Troup, 49, were acquitted of conspiracy to commit misconduct in public office.

Former managing editor Graham Dudman, 51 and ex-deputy news editor Ben O'Driscoll, 38, were also cleared of some charges.

But the jury are still deliberating on a number of charges in the case at Kingston Crown Court which has heard allegations that six reporters and editors at the tabloid paid out thousands of pounds to police officers, soldiers, prison and hospital staff for information about celebrities, killers and the Royal Family.

Former East Anglia reporter John Troup can now start to rebuild his life after being fired from Uttlesford District Council, where he was head of communications, immediately after his arrest in January 2013 over a single accusation that he paid a prison guard for one story.

The weakness of the case against him was exposed when he took the witness box and it emerged he had not even written the story he was accused of paying for.

The former top reporter, who spent 19 years at the tabloid exposing gang warfare in Manchester and revealing security flaws at Heathrow Airport after the Lockerbie crash was reduced to slicing bacon at the local butchers to make ends meet following his arrest.

His former colleague, John Edwards, was also acquitted yesterday of two counts, that he conspired to pay Broadmoor nurse Robert Neave and Surrey Police officer Simon Quinn for confidential information.

Yesterday Dudman was acquitted of paying a prison guard at HMP Whitemoor for a story about a prisoner's suicide.

O'Driscoll was also cleared of paying Simon Quinn for stories.

But the jury are still considering other corruption charges against them, which they deny.

After a week of deliberations, the jury in the three month trial has also not yet reached a verdict on three corruption charges against head of news Chris Pharo, 45, and reporter Jamie Pyatt, 51.

All six defendants were earlier cleared on the orders of the judge of an overarching conspiracy described as ‘corruption on a grand scale’ to pay public officials for stories.
