Barack Obama's hair is turning grey so rapidly that even the First Lady made a joke about it on his 50th birthday last year.

But that hasn't stopped the TV advertisement of the first Obama / Biden re-election campaign from featuring a remarkably youthful-looking president with luxuriant brown hair.

Like many world leaders, Mr Obama has aged during the three years he has been in office, a process that in his case has been most visible through his greying hair.

President Obama and Republican front-runner Mitt Romney are neck-and-neck in the race for the White House, a poll showed today.

A survey conducted by CBS News and the New York Times found that 45 per cent of voters would support Mr Obama if the election was held now.

Mr Romney would also receive 45 per cent of the vote.

But independent voters, who helped propel Mr Obama to victory in the 2008 election, could be an obstacle in his bid for a second term in the White House.

A majority of independent voters have soured on Mr Obama's presidency, disapprove of his handling of the economy and do not have a clear idea of what he hopes to accomplish if re-elected, the Times reported.

Only 31 per cent of independent voters have a favourable opinion of the president and two-thirds say he has not made real progress in fixing the economy, the Times reported.

In 2008, Obama won support from 52 per cent of independent voters, compared with 44 per cent who supported Republican presidential nominee John McCain.

The president launched his first television ad of his re-election campaign, a 30-second spot, yesterday.

It defends his energy record against 
criticism from a Republican-leaning outside group in a sign that the 
presidential race is entering a new phase even though Republicans have 
yet to pick a challenger.

The commercial responds to a 
$6million ad campaign by a group backed by the billionaire Koch brothers
accusing Mr Obama of conducting pay-for-play politics in the bankruptcy
of California energy company Solyndra, which imploded despite a 
$528million federal loan.

The Obama ad opens by citing 
'secretive billionaires attacking President Obama with ads fact-checkers
say are not tethered to the facts'.

It says that the president has added 
2.7million clean energy jobs while reducing the nation's dependence on 
foreign oil, calling Mr Obama's record on ethics 'unprecedented'.

The voiceover ends by saying: 
'President Obama. Kept his promise to toughen ethics rules and 
strengthen America's energy economy.'

The Obama campaign has bought ad time
in Michigan, Virginia, Ohio, North Carolina, Wisconsin and Iowa and on 
national cable television, according to a campaign official, who spoke 
on the condition of anonymity.

The president's advisers are moving 
to directly rebut attacks from Republican presidential candidates who 
have assailed Mr Obama in early voting states such as Iowa, New 
Hampshire and South Carolina.

The ad comes in the aftermath of his 
decision to reject a job-producing oil pipeline running from Canada 
through Texas, citing environmental and public safety concerns.

It will be coupled with stepped-up travel surrounding next Tuesday's State Of The Union address.

The president heads to Florida later 
today and then visits five states over three days next week to discuss 
the policies he will pursue leading up to his re-election campaign.

The president's advisers had 
anticipated a lengthy fight in the Republican primaries, but the 
decision to begin airing ads reflects the need to respond to criticism 
from outside Republican groups and prepare for a campaign against Mitt 
Romney.

The former Massachusetts governor has
won contests in Iowa and New Hampshire and shown strength in upcoming 
contests in South Carolina and Florida, giving him an inside track to 
the nomination.

By the end of last year, Mr Obama had
raised more than $220million for his campaign and the Democratic 
National Committee, giving him a strong foundation to run a national 
campaign across the airwaves and on the ground.

In the State Of The Union address, Mr
Obama is expected to draw parallels to a speech he delivered in Kansas 
in December, when he said the nation's middle-class and those aspiring 
to the middle-class faced 'a make-or-break moment' and the nation needed
economic policies that would give everyone a 'fair shot and a fair 
share'.

The president will discuss proposals 
from the address in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, and Phoenix, Arizona, on January
25 and in Las Vegas, Nevada, and Denver, Colorado, the following day. 
On January 27, Mr Obama will speak in Detroit, Michigan.

All five states are considered 
critical to Mr Obama's re-election. He won the Iowa caucuses in 2008, 
sending him on a path to the White House, but the state looks like a 
toss-up this year.

Colorado, Nevada and Arizona are 
three Western states the president's campaign covets, while Michigan is 
expected to get ample attention from Republicans after the economic 
recession hurt the state's manufacturing base.
