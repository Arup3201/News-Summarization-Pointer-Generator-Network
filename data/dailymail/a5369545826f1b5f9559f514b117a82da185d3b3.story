Laughing as she carries her baby son in her arms, Kate Middleton clearly enjoyed taking son Prince George on his first foreign holiday.

Kate jetted out to Mustique just over a week ago with the six-month-old, leaving husband Prince William at home to continue his studies at Cambridge.

The image was captured by a freelance photographer as she was disembarking a British Airways flight in St Vincent before catching a  private jet to the exclusive Caribbean island.

Happy holiday: Kate Middleton and George after arriving in the Caribbean for their winter break

Appearing unperturbed by his flight, the third in line to the throne was wearing a white-and-blue babygro and a patterned sun hat against the fierce heat.

William has hinted his son has a healthy appetite and these new pictures, published in Hello! magazine this week, show him to be a bouncing little boy.

His mother, looking chic and casual in a Ralph Lauren top, jeggings and pumps by Mint Velvet, seemed to be relishing the prospect of some winter sun.

She was accompanied in her First Class cabin by two bodyguards and her brother, James Middleton, who gallantly carried off her Brics hand luggage for her.

It is believed her parents, Michael and Carole Middleton, and sister, Pippa, were waiting at their €23,000-a-week villa on the exclusive private island.

The holiday was in part organised to celebrate Mrs Middleton’s 59th birthday last week.

Mustique
 has become a favourite holiday destination of the millionaire Middleton
 family, who made their fortune selling party good on the internet.

It
 boasts just 74 villas - one of which once belonged to the Queen’s 
sister, Princess Margaret - and one small hotel. It is patrolled by 
eagle-eyed security guards both on and off shore.

The family returned to England yesterday after their sunshine break, no doubt to doting father Prince William’s delight.

The future king remained behind in England where he is almost half way through a 10-week agricultural course being taught at Cambridge University.

George may find himself on another long-haul flight in a few months as the Cambridges are making an official visit to New Zealand and Australia in April, and are hoping to take their son with them.

The baby prince will have travelled some 40,000 miles before he is even ten months old. The February 10 issue of Hello! magazine is on sale now.
