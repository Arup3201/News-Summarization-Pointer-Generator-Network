Jailed: Con artist Alan Fitzgerald preyed on vulnerable pensioners, stealing £300,000 from them for jobs he never finished

An 'aggressive and dishonest' cowboy builder who robbed £300,000 from vulnerable pensioners, including one 94-year-old woman, has been jailed.

Alan Fitzgerald, 47, told one elderly female victim she had asbestos in her home and would be prosecuted if she did not pay him a huge sum for unnecessary building work.

The conman, from Wellingborough, who has no building qualifications, was jailed for six years after ripping off 39 victims.

Fitzgerald took life savings from pensioners across Northamptonshire by overcharging them for work he never even finished.

On average he would add more than £20,000 onto a bill for work, which cost less than £9,600.

The prosecution described him as 'misleading, aggressive and dishonest' in court and said he would drive victims to cash points to make sure he was paid.

Northampton Crown Court heard how Fitzgerald targeted elderly victims, preyed on the infirm and intimidated pensioners by warning that their homes urgently required repair work.

Once he had identified a vulnerable victim, he would continue to 'tap the well', the court heard, and would return time and time again to fleece them of more cash.

Fitzgerald even continued to rip-off customers after his first appearance in court last year.

He has pleaded guilty to two counts of fraudulent trading, one charge in relation to each of his firms.

Northamptonshire County Council's trading standards team said it had received complaints about Fitzgerald dating back to 2005 and had issued him with a number of warnings.

Sentenced: Fitzgerald was jailed for six years at Northampton Crown Court after he admitted fleecing dozens of victims, including one 94-year-old woman

Officers said there were a further 46 complaints not included in the formal charges.

Fitzgerald who has never filed a tax return for his building company, was jailed on Tuesday.

Sentencing him, Judge Richard Bray said: 'I have to sentence you for serious premeditated frauds.

'I am satisfied that you targeted vulnerable victims, pressuring them into handing large sums of money to you, often in cash and often representing substantial parts off their life savings.

'Ten of the victims in the first indictment alone were over 70. Many of them were infirm, some of them had carers,

'One of them was a lady aged 94. You threatened her that she could be prosecuted if she didn't have repair work carried out by you.

'You obtained £6,000 in advance from her for work you didn't carry out properly, or at all. It is a truly despicable offence.'
