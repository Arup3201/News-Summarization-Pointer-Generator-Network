It was a day of firsts for Whitecaps FC striker Robert Earnshaw as he wasted no time in grabbing his first goal for his new club by scoring with his first touch of the ball against Portland Timbers on Saturday evening. 

With the game looking as though it was heading for a 1-1 draw, Welsh manager Carl Robinson put faith in his veteran compatriot, bringing him on as an 87th minute substitute for the Vancouver outfit

Within three minutes, the former Premier League striker was putting the ball in the back of the net and showboating his trademark somersault celebration.

Earnshaw punches the air in delight as he celebrates his 90th minute strike that decided the game 

Following a finely weighted through ball from Pedro Morales and some circus-like defending from former West Bromdefender Liam Ridgewell and Nat Borchers, Earnshaw found himself bearing down on goal with just the keeper to beat.

Putting any debut match jitters to one side in front of the home crowd at BC Place, the 33-year-old finished with aplomb with a delightful dink over the onrushing Adam Kwarasey.

After his signing was confirmed on Wednesday, the former Cardiff, Nottingham Forest and Derby County striker's input took the 'Caps to their third straight victory before they host LA Galaxy on Sunday, and he was thrilled to get on the score sheet so early in his Whitecaps career.

'The length of time I've been playing football and that feeling when the ball hits the net, oh my god, it's the best,' Earnshaw told reporters after the game.

But it's not the first time Earnshaw has been among the goals during an MLS debut. The Welshman also netted on his first game for previous club, Chicago Fire, and also bagged a brace on his home debut with Toronto FC.

Caps boss Robinson is a keen admirer of Earnshaw and his match-winning performance on Saturday merely confirmed his belief.

'I said he'll get one chance,' Robinson said. 'I brought him here because he can score goals. When he gets the chance and he gets in the right position, he usually takes it. I knew he'd get one chance. The coolness of the finish and the calmness in his head was outstanding.'

Former Wales striker Earnshaw, who announced his retirement from international football last week, is not the only Brit to be plying his trade in the ever-expanding MLS.

Since David Beckham's high-profile move to LA Galaxy in 2007, and with Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard and former Chelsea star Frank Lampard set to embark on a career in America, there has been an influx of British talent travelling across the Atlantic. 

Among those stars currently earning a living in the States alongside Earnshaw and Ridgewell are former Charlton forwards, Bradley Wright Phillips and Lloyd Sam (New York Red Bulls), former Burnley and Wigan defender Steven Caldwell (Toronto FC) and ex-Aston Villa midfielder Nigel Reo-Coker (Vancouver Whitecaps).
