2013 saw the likes of 
Britney Spears and Simon Cowell admit to having had cosmetic surgery to help fight the signs of ageing.

And it seems that vain Brits are following their lead, with 2014 set to see a huge surge in treatments.

A new survey has analysed what will prove to be the most popular procedures in the coming year and according to the results lipotripsy, chinplants and vaginoplasty look set to take the cosmetic world by storm.

Hot for 2014: A new study has delved into the cosmetic surgery trends of this year and predicted what will be big news for next year

Women will continue to aspire to capture Hollywood glamour and opt to have chin implants - a procedure recently revealed to have been undertaken by movie starlet, Marilyn Monroe.

The procedure, which claims to add definition and balance facial features, has seen enquiries double since 2010 and clinics expect the desire for a striking and defined chin to continue far into 2014.

There will also be huge demand for more intimate treatments as the quest for a ‘designer vagina’ intensifies, with labiaplasty and vaginoplasty amongst the UK’s fastest growing cosmetic surgery procedures.

Labiaplasty is a surgical procedure to reduce the size of, or reshape, the labia minora (inner vagina lips) either for medical or aesthetic reasons.

Vaginoplasty ‘tightens’ the vagina and is a procedure that is particularly popular among women who have given birth.

Celebrity inspired: Following on from the likes of Kim Kardashian (L) and Coleen Rooney (R), non-surgical treatments are the ones to watch, claim experts

The clinic reports that enquiries for the procedures have grown from 2,400 in 2010 to over 3,500 in 2013.

'Such
 results suggest that more and more women will feel empowered to undergo
 a vaginoplasty procedure in the coming year - and this is certainly set
 to be the surgery on everyone’s lips in 2014,' said a spokesperson for 
Transform Cosmetic Surgery, who carried out the research.

While
 many people will go under the knife in their quest for ageless skin, 
others will opt for non-surgical treatments, which account for 75 per 
cent of the cosmetic industry.

Following on from the likes of Kim Kardashian, Coleen Rooney and Sharon Osbourne, these treatments are the ones to watch, claim experts.

Pain-free: Non surgical face lifts are set to be big news next year as people strive for more radiant skin without the pain and recovery time

Anti-ageing treatments such as dermal fillers, Botox and chemical facial peels are fast becoming a must on beauty-lovers’ lists.

Combined, they claim to provide the ideal 'face-lift' that is seen to be taking over the surgical face-lift by restoring the contour of the face without the need for any surgery.

Mesotherapy - a treatment of 
micro-injections on the mesoderm (the middle layer of the skin) 
containing collagen-stimulating vitamins to reduce the signs of ageing - will also hit the mainstream, predict experts.

As for non-surgical body treatments, Lipotripsy - a non-invasive, pain-fee treatment that works by stimulating the fat breakdown, collagen synthesis and lymphatic drainage - looks set to be big news.

Lipotripsy claims to treat the arms, saddlebags, thighs, hips, love handles and abdomen by increasing oxygen levels and improving the skin's elasticity and smoothness.

The research also suggests that the 
allure of boobs - whether to have them bigger, smaller or more pert - 
will continue to be one of the most popular cosmetic procedures in the 
UK.  

A spokesperson for Transform Cosmetic Surgery said: 'There is a growing awareness of the different types of surgery available to people, coupled with the increasing desire to look and feel at your best.

'Patients come to us as they want to feel good about their bodies and surgery can help them, and ultimately improve their self-confidence.

'Whilst surgical procedures are still very popular, it’s the non-surgical procedures that are proving to be a key theme and this trend is set to continue into 2014 and beyond.'
