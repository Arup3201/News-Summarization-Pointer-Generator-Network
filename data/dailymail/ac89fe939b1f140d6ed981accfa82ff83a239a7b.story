She's more often seen in a cocktail dress but Samantha Cameron today proved that she's not afraid to don questionable outfits if there's a good cause involved.

The Prime Minister's wife donned a Christmas knit designed by George at Asda as she threw open the doors to No.10 to a group of schoolchildren.

The beaming youngsters, all of whom were wearing festive jumpers themselves, had come from all over the country for the event. 

The Prime Minister's wife joined more than 40 youngsters as they swapped the winter woollies

The festive knitwear was designed to raise money for the charity Save the Children 

But the biggest smile of all belonged to Mrs Cameron, 43, who was wearing a light blue creation featuring falling snow and robins.

Also wearing knits by the supermarket were the children, all aged between four and 11, who had travelled to Downing Street from schools around the country.

These included Stewart Fleming School and Courtland Primary School in London, Sea Mills Primary school in Bristol, St Johns & St Peters CofE in Birmingham, Linthorpe Community School in Middlesborough and Birchfields Primary school in Manchester.

The festive jumble sale came on Christmas Jumper Day, an annual event held to raise money for Save the Children, which wants wearers to donate £2 to help vulnerable youngsters.

After they displayed their designs the children then swapped them under Mrs Cameron's watchful eye 

The event saw saw much oooing and ahhing over the jumpers, with many children wearing festive head gear 

Speaking during the event, Terence Lovell, the charity's head of community giving, said: 'People across the UK are wearing their festive knitwear to help support children both here in the UK and around the world.

'Samantha Cameron has been an ambassador for Save the Children for several years and we're delighted to have her support.

'She's been wearing her jumper. She's done a wonderful job encouraging all the children who've designed their fantastic jumpers.'  

Clearly in the festive spirit, the Prime Minister's wife seemed to be having as much fun as the children
