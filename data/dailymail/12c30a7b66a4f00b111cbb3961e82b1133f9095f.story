An Australian woman has revealed the details of an alleged assault on board a Malaysia Airlines flight to Paris earlier this month.

The 26-year-old woman, who is identified only as Laura claims she was sexually assaulted by the chief air steward on a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Paris and is speaking out publicly for the first time about the incident on Channel Sevenâ€™s Sunday Night this weekend.

Laura says she told the chief steward she was scared about flying with the beleaguered airline as she boarded the plane and the steward reassured her and said he would check on her throughout the flight.

Three hours into the flight, Laura, who was seated by herself in the back row of the plane, alleges she was attacked by the steward.

Laura alleges that when the steward approached her, he blocked her into the seat, put his hand under her blanket and proceeded to sexually assault her.

Laura was too scared to move or scream, however, she did manage to hit record on her mobile phone under her pillow and capture audio of the alleged assault occurring.

Later in the flight, after the man had left, Laura told another passenger what had happened and the captain was called.

Laura confronted the steward after the alleged assault and filmed the encounter

The steward was summoned to the back of the plane and Laura filmed her confrontation with him. During the video, the steward is pictured with his head in his hands looking distraught.

Laura was moved to the business class section of the plane for the rest of the flight, but says instead of being protected by the crew, she was left alone by crew members and her alleged attacker approached her and tried to convince her to drop her accusations against him.

Upon landing in Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris, the steward, who is a married father-of-three, was detained by police and is still behind bars as investigations continue.

Laura says she feels let down by the airline and is speaking to Sunday Night about her ordeal with the hope of encouraging other women who might have suffered assault to come forward.
