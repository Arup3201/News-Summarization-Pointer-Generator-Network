Romeo Beckham has joined his brother Brooklyn in Arsenal's academy.

The 12-year-old played for the Gunners on Thursday in a match against Liverpool at the Anfield club's Kirby academy.

And Romeo is said to have been a stand-out performer for the young Arsenal outfit. Father David made the trip to Merseyside to watch his son feature for the north London side.

And despite wearing a thick orange coat and a woolly grey hat, the former England captain was swiftly recognised by a number of Liverpool youth players. 

Marc Pelosi, 20, a regular for Liverpool Under 21s who has represented the United States at youth level, tweeted a picture with Beckham alongside the caption 'look who I found at our training ground.'

Eldest brother Brooklyn has made significant strides since joining the club's Hale End academy last year.

Despite being only 15, he has already been named on the bench for Arsenal's Under-18s.

And two of Liverpool's highly regarded young defenders, Ryan McLaughlin and Lloyd Jones, also managed to get a snap with Beckham.

Despite his allegiances to Liverpool's fierce rivals Manchester United, the pair were  clearly overjoyed to have a picture with the iconic midfielder.

As well as playing for United, Beckham enjoyed spells at Real Madrid, LA Galaxy, AC Milan and Paris Saint-Germain.

'The main man,' wrote Jones, 19, alongside his Beckham picture, while McLaughlin, 20, wrote: 'With Becks today! What a man.' 

The former Real Madrid player's son Brooklyn, 15, was an unused substitute during Arsenal Under 18s 1-0 win over Leicester last week.
