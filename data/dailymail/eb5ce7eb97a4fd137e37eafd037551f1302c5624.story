A Waitrose worker has spoken of the moment a woman threatened to stab him with a blood-filled needle while shouting she was HIV positive. 

The man approached Billy Jo Kelly, 35, after he noticed her acting suspiciously when she entered the store in Willerby, Hull. 

When the man confronted her, she waved the blood-filled needle in his face before leaving the shop with a trolley filled with £500 worth of goods. 

The supermarket worker, who wished to remain anonymous, told MailOnline: 'A woman came into the shop looking very suspicious.

'I was alerted to the fact she was at the welcome desk trying to exchange products she had clearly just picked up from the shelves. 

'When I went over to challenge her she started shouting for someone else and when they didn't appear she pulled out a syringe and threatened to stab me. 

'The main thing going through my head was to make sure everybody was safe. A few pounds' worth of stock wasn't worth a staff member getting injured. 

'I stepped away and called the police and told the other members of staff to avoid going near her. 

'There was another guy who was taking stuff off the shelves and someone waiting in a car outside. 

'She then left with a trolley of goods totalling over £500, including a DVD player, hair straighteners, a duvet cover and toiletries. It was a really broad selection of stuff.'

He added: 'I have been in retail 20 years and that's the second time someone has pulled a syringe on me. 

'The staff are shaken up by what happened.'
