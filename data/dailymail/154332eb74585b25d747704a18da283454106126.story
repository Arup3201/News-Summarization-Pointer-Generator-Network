She may be losing friends on Made In Chelsea but Lucy Watson is certainly making up for it in the professional stakes.

The reality TV star, who was lambasted by Binky Felstead in last night's episode, has just been unveiled as the face of yet another beauty brand.

The 24-year-old, who is currently in New York filming for the E4 show, is Skinny Tan's first celebrity ambassador and has revealed her top tanning tips for this summer.

Tanned and toned: Made In Chelsea star Lucy Watson has been unveiled as the new face of Skinny Tan, an Australian tanning brand, which claims to beat cellulite

Australian brand Skinny Tan contains cellulite-busting ingredients, so as well as well as giving you a natural bronzed look, it's also supposed to reduce the appearance of cellulite, contours muscles and improves tone.

Speaking about her new gig, Lucy said: 'What I love about Skinny Tan is that it provides a gorgeous even tan, smells great and uses natural products that don’t harm or dry out my skin.'

Speaking about their tan, which is made with a natural tanning active derived from the seeds of the Brassica napus - or rapeseed - plant, co-founders Kate Cotton and Louise Ferguson said: 'We’re delighted to be working with Lucy, and she’s so naturally beautiful and a perfect fit for our natural tanning brand.'

Lucy was once again at the centre of Made In Chelsea drama in last night's episode. Following 
weeks of heartache thanks to her cheating boyfriend Alex Mytton, Binky 
Felstead found herself in yet another drama caused by her relationship 
with the love rat. 

Celebrity ambassador: The co-founders of the brand say they're delighted to be working with Lucy, describing her as 'so naturally beautiful and a perfect fit for our natural tanning brand'

Things
 came to a head at Sam Thompson’s party in Marylebone as Alex Mytton and
 Binky Felstead looked particularly close despite the recent revelations
 about his behaviour during their relationship.

Her
 friends Lucy Watson and Cheska Hull were extremely disapproving about 
the situation and when Binky decided to talk to her friends about the 
tension, the conversation took an aggressive turn.

The argument led
 to Binky telling Cheska to ‘go f*** yourself’ after she snapped at Lucy
 Watson by claiming ‘the world doesn’t revolve around you’.

Drama aside, Lucy's career is going from strength to strength. She was recently unveiled as the new face - and smooth legs - of Wilkinson Sword, the face of Lipsy VIP and has her own book, The Dating Game.

Lucy also recently posed naked for a PETA campaign, modelled for 
Vesper dresses and has been working on her jewellery range.

Lucy's agent told MailOnline: 'Deliberately, Lucy has made the choice to be super 
careful about who she works with. Over exposure is really common with 
reality television stars, and for Lucy, it's always been about the long 
game. She has turned down far more deals than she has approved.'

Lucy launched her jewellery brand, 
Creature, at the beginning of 2014, and has worked in an ambassadorial 
role for a number of brands.

'Lucy is looking to develop her 
profile in the health and fitness arena, and is looking forward to 
promoting awareness about animal testing, through exploring 
opportunities around creating her own range, as well as wanting to 
create a documentary drawing attention to the issue.

'Lucy has a number of meetings in LA 
and New York planned for the summer, and she has been approached with 
some exciting international opportunities,' added the source.

Speaking about plans for the future, Lucy told MailOnline: 'I
want to stay in the industry and being on MIC has taught me loads about
working behind-the-scenes producing and directing, which I love, so 
maybe one day I will look into that.

'I also love presenting and would love to have my own show,' she said.

Not happy: Things came to a head at Sam 
Thompson's party as Alex Mytton and Binky Felstead looked particularly 
close and Lucy Watson and Cheska Hull were extremely disapproving about 
the situation
