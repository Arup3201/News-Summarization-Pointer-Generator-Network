Evelyn Clarke is believed to have fallen from a high rising building in Dubai on Sunday

Grief-stricken friends have paid tribute to the 'beautiful and bubbly' British air stewardess who fell to her death from a Dubai skyscraper.

Evelyn Clarke, 28, who died from multiple injuries, is thought to have been on a night out with friends when she fell from a tower block window late on Sunday.

Miss Clarke worked for the airline Emirates and was living with friends in Dubai.

She is not thought to have had any personal problems and suicide is not suspected.

Friends paying tribute to Miss Clarke on a memorial page set up on Facebook described a 'beautiful person' whose 'big hair, big personality and big smile' made her the life of the party.

Police are interviewing the last people to see her alive.

Kay Anderson posted on Facebook: ‘Oh Evelyn, I can’t believe you’re gone.

‘Loved the way you laughed in the face of anything bad that was thrown at you. You had life’s priorities in the right order, family and friends but most of all love.’

Another, Katrina Raine, said: ‘Life can be so cruel sometimes, such a loss of a beautiful person. Carry on partying up there glamorous girl.’

Nickki McCabe said: ‘My sidekick and partner in crime for many years back in the day! . . . So so many good memories. You will be sorely missed.’

Yesterday at their home in Irvine, Ayrshire, relatives said the family were too upset to comment.

A neighbour on the quiet street where her parents Maryann and Edmund have lived for years said they were a ‘lovely family’.

The neighbour added: ‘They’re a lovely family and they will be absolutely heartbroken. Evelyn hadn’t lived with them for a while as she worked away but she visited and seemed to be always smiling.’

Another friend wrote: 'She wanted to travel the world and see as much as possible, she couldn't get enough of it.

According to a report in the Evening Times the message went on: 'Her positive attitude and energy could light up the whole sky…Those who have met her will never forget her.'

A Foreign Office spokesman said: ‘We are aware of the death of a British national in Dubai. We are providing consular assistance at this very difficult time.’

Miss Clarke’s death comes less than a month after British bride Abbie Emmett, 27, died after falling from a hotel window on honeymoon in the United Arab Emirates. Police say it was a tragic accident.

Such falls are an increasingly common problem in the high-rise city famed for its party scene, with an Indian man also reported to have died over the weekend.
