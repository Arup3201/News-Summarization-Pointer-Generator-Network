A 23-year-old man with Down Syndrome in mixed martial arts (MMA) training for years is now fighting to get into the ring.

Garrett Holeve, of Florida, has been denied permission to fight against David Steffan, another disabled fighter. The two men were presented with a cease-and-desist order Aug 2 by the Florida State Boxing Commission just before they were scheduled to step into the ring, according to reports. 

The fight was organized against Mr Steffan because, having cerebral palsy, he was seen as a fair opponent.

Though state boxing commissions do not 
typically regulate amateur MMA fights, they stepped in to stop the fight
between the two disabled men on grounds it was unsanctioned, according 
to Headline News.

Despite training non-stop for two months and having the backing of promoters, Mitch Holeve, Garrett Holeve’s father, fears the fight might never happen.

‘It's our belief, based on conversation with people within the MMA community, that getting it done in any state isn't going to be easy,’ the father told HLN.

Mitch Holeve further explained that he feels his son not being allowed into the ring is a public relations move by the sport.

‘There is a core group of people involved in MMA that are trying to protect the sport from bad PR,’ Mitch Holeve told the network. "They feel having disabled people compete would give the sport a 'black eye.' They are also afraid of the 'sideshow' effect.’

A conspiracy: Mitch Holeve, the 23-year-old aspiring fighter's father, feels his son isn't being allowed into the ring because insiders want to protect the sport's image - a sentiment with which a promoter who spoke to MailOnline agreed

A prominent New York-based promoter echoed Mitch Holeve's concerns in comments to MailOnline.

‘This
is all image, if somebody gets hurt on your show… I don’t see the 
upside to doing that,’ a New York-based fight promoter said.

‘If somebody gets hurt, then you’re the guy who put [a disabled person] in the ring,’ the promoter added.

There is a wide gulf between the people in favour of G-Money – as Garrett Holeve is known in the ring – fighting, and those against it.

‘One respected athletic inspector said that allowing Garrett Holeve to fight in an MMA bout was exploitative, no matter if the audience cheered and gave Holeve a standing ovation after the fight,’ Zach Arnold, editor of MMA website Fight Opinion told HLN.

‘The concept of allowing someone with… limited cognitive ability and brain issues to take punches and get slammed drew a swiftly negative reaction amongst the people I interviewed,’ Arnold added.

It's his dream: All Mr Holeve wants to do is get in the ring, in a fair fight - he's not gunning for the UFC

Nick Newell, famous for going undefeated in his first 10 professional MMA fights as an amputee, has trained with Holeve – and feels he’s getting a raw deal.

‘I think we should give him a chance,’ Mr Newell told MailOnline. ‘Everyone deserves an equal chance.’

Explaining that he’s also trained with Mr Steffan, Mr Newell – who goes by ‘Notorious’ in the ring, said that both men are equal competitors.

‘I think that’s a good fair fight, the kid’s not asking to fight in the UFC,’ said Mr Newell, adding that ‘he just wants a small-time, amateur fight.’

Explaining that ‘it’s not a street fight,’ and that there are referees and medics, Mr Newell said ‘it’s safety first... it's not like he's even going to be on TV.'

Notorious: Mr Newell has won his first 10 pro fights and is a champion, he doesn't feel it's fair to keep Mr Holeve out of the ring

Mr Newell said that he noticed no physical limitations with Garrett Holeve when he trained and that it will not matter if he wins or loses, he just wants to get into the ring.

'People said the same things about me… and look at me, I’m 10-0 and a world champion,' the undefeated fighter said.

For now, according to HLN, the two fighters are looking to fight in Nebraska – and Mr Newell is all for it.

‘If the kid’s training hard and chasing his dream, who’s anyone to say he can’t… it’s not fair.’
