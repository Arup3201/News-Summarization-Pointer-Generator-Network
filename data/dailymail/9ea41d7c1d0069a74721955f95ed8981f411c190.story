Kevin Jones is the type of dad you really don't want to mess with.

The father from Louisville, Kentucky, was shocked to catch his daughter sneaking behind his back.

At 5 foot 11 and just 10-years-old, the little girl - who The Mail Online chose not to name - appears much more mature than she is, and had been using that online to pass as someone of around 15.

She had secretly set up social media accounts pretending to be a teenager and even had a boyfriend. 

Learning her lesson: This Louisville girl, who looks much older than her 10 years, was caught sneaking around and lying about her age, so her dad decided to teach her a lesson

Punishment: She was dressed up in pink, with a child's backpack and bows and an 'age defining shirt'

Dressing her age: Photos of the outfit quickly went viral, with parents all over commending what Mr Jones did

So her old man decided she needed to learn a lesson - a very public one.

He created a cute shirt announcing her age, put barrettes and bows in her hair and gave her a princess backpack.

'She claims to be in love and going out with a boyfriend which is completely against my rules!!!!' Mr Jones wrote on his Facebook, posting pictures of his daughter.

'I uncovered that she has been doing this for quite some time.

'Here's the consequences behind her actions.'

The little girl does not look at all happy with her punishment, however it was well-recieved online and quickly went viral.

Father figure: Kevin Jones said his daughter broke some of his rules, and she had to be punished

'I am 10-years-old': The little girl does not look happy at what her father made her do

Parents from all over got behind Mr Jones, saying he did the right thing and was a good father.

Posted on October 21, it has got almost 250,000 likes and has been shared over 77,000 times.

'You did the right thing. I bet she got in line real quick . So keep it up. You’re an awesome dad. She will thank you later when she’s not pregnant at 12 and has a standing chance in this world,' one supporter wrote.
