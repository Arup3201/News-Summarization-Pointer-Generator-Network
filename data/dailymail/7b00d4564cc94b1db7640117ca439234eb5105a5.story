‘English players are probably scared to come abroad,’ he said as he was introduced to the Italian media shortly after completing his first full training session for last season’s Serie A runners-up. 

‘Our players are in the comfort zone in England. It’s where we grew up, where we starting played for our youth team, and most of us never left.

Signing on: Cole will play for Roma for the next two years after moving from west London

Between 2006 and 2010, Ashley and Joe Cole’s presence at Chelsea meant the pair displayed first initials on their shirts as well as surnames.

Ashley wore ‘A. Cole’ on his back for the rest of his time at the club, and has now taken it with him to Roma, despite there being no other Coles in the squad.

Maybe he knows something we don’t. A Roma move for Carlton Cole, perhaps?

‘When I heard I had the chance to 
come to a big club in Italy it was something I wanted to do. Clubs 
abroad don’t come in for English players as much as people think.

‘I’ve
 never been out of London so this is a big opportunity for me to try a 
different language, a different culture and a different way of living.’ 

Given
 all the hand-wringing after England’s latest World Cup disaster, Cole’s
 comments have resonance. He is only the ninth Englishman to try Serie A
 since Italia 90.

Every 
member of Roy Hodgson’s team in Brazil was home-based apart from 
Celtic’s unused goalkeeper Fraser Forster. Cole, of course, was 
controversially left out to give youth a fling. 

At
 33, he is ready to embrace  a new challenge having been  discarded by 
Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho. It is a challenge he did not have to take
 with millions in the bank and a trophy cabinet containing Champions 
League,  Premier League and FA Cup winners’ medals and 107 England caps.

Already,
 there have been new experiences. The temperature touched 100 degrees at
 his first training session, not something he would have felt too often 
at Arsenal and Chelsea.

Hundreds of excited Roma fans were out in force, waiting by the gates of their training complex to greet their new hero.

Cole has a poor off-the-field  reputation but he was smiley  and self-effacing when he met the Italian press gang.

Despite
 believing more English players should go abroad, his own move was not 
solely of his choosing. His manager felt he could not do the job of the 
modern Premier League full back which is to run up and down for 90 
minutes.

‘Jose and I still 
have a good relationship,’ said Cole. ‘I was just getting a little bit 
old for what he liked. But I understand that. This is football and my 
time was up at Chelsea.

‘Once
 I knew Roma were interested and I spoke to Rudi Garcia (the manager), 
it felt right. It was the way they showed me love and wanted me to be 
part of what they think is going to be big.’

Cole,
 who retired from international football after being left out the World 
Cup, had offers to play in America’s MLS but fancied something more 
competitive.‘I enjoy pressure. I wanted a challenge, to play in the Champions League. Hopefully we can win the Italian league,’ he said.

‘I’m
 ready to adapt to a new country. I’ve already seen the passion and 
desire Roma fans have. If I go out, I know fans will come up to me, but I
 am going to enjoy the city and not be afraid of that.’ 

Club-wise, there can be little for Cole to regret. He won the Premier League with two teams and a record seven FA Cups.

Regarding
 England, his World Cup exclusion was a body blow. Diplomatically, Cole 
is trying to encourage the next generation who under-performed in 
Brazil, while making it clear the Premier League’s finest were a 
let-down.

‘Yeah, of course I
 watched the England games, as a fan this time,’ he said. ‘It was a 
young, inexperienced team and you have got to give them a chance to 
flourish and develop. It didn’t go as well as people thought and would 
have liked but now some of these young lads have experience under their 
belts.’

Cole is too smart 
not to know a little about the reputation Italian football has for 
racism among  elements of supporters. Paul Ince suffered from it in the 
1990s with Inter Milan, and Mario Balotelli singles out Rome and 
Florence as where he gets most abuse.

The
 defender picked his words carefully on the subject. ‘I am asked a lot 
about it. I had it when I played for England in Spain and nothing was 
done. Maybe it is time people higher up tackled it a bit more.’ Roma
 have plenty of experience to make Cole feel at home. The king of Rome, 
Francesco Totti, is 37. Daniele de Rossi and Brazil right back Maicon 
are in their 30s. So is reported target Samuel Eto’o, Cole’s former 
Chelsea team-mate.

Ex-Arsenal forward Gervinho and Turkish prospect Salih Ucan represent the younger generation.‘I’ve
 played under some great managers; Arsene Wenger, Carlo Ancelotti, 
Jose,’ said Cole. ‘Now it’s time to make some new memories — in a new 
environment.’

Jermain Defoe - Toronto

The former West Ham striker, who has played 55 times for England, left Tottenham in January 2014 to pursue a new career in the MLS with Toronto.

Emile Heskey - Newcastle Jets

Heskey played 62 times for England between 1999 and 2010 but ended his stay at Aston Villa in 2012 when he moved to Australia to play for Newcastle Jets.

Michael Mancienne - Hamburg

Capped at England U21 level, Mancienne struggled to break into Chelsea's team and was sent out on loan to QPR and Wolves. Mancienne left Chelsea in 2011, though, and has been in the Bundesliga with Hamburg ever since.

Anton Ferdinand - Police United

The former West Ham centre back moved to Antalyaspor last season but made just three appearances for the Turkish side. He has now made the switch to Thailand to play for Police United.
