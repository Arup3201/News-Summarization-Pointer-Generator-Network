Insurers will pay £500million to those affected by floods and storms last month.

The news comes ahead of more rain today – but forecasters predict most areas will be dry and sunny by the weekend.

Temperatures are expected to reach 23C (73F) on Sunday and 25C (77F) on Monday for most of eastern and southern England, although there is a chance of showers in the north and west.

Sadly, the summery conditions could be short-lived, with more unsettled weather predicted to move in from the west on Tuesday.

This may, however, clear before the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games next Friday.

Yesterday saw more heavy rainfall, with up to 1.2in – the equivalent of two weeks’ worth – falling in some places.

But Helen Rossington, a forecaster at MeteoGroup, said: ‘We should see an improvement this weekend.

‘Saturday is when the high pressure should start building, with sunny spells, and showers should be few and far between.

'Sunday will be a warm day reaching 23C in eastern England, and should be mostly dry and bright for the south.

'It could be even warmer on Monday, with temperatures up to 25C.’

A dry end to July would be good news 
for insurance firms. The bill for weather damage in June equates to 
about £17million for each day, according to figures from the Association
of British Insurers.

About 15,000 of the 68,000 claims are  classified as flood damage, with others relating to storms and heavy winds.
