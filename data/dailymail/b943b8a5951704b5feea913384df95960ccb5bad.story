These amazing pictures show monkeys, penguins and lemurs at Newquay Zoo looking both transfixed and in hysterics as they try to interact with bubbles.

A bubble machine has been brought into the zoo by keepers as part of an ongoing programme to keep the animals mentally and physically stimulated.

And to the  delight of zoo visitors, the displays take place in public, with the penguins frantically waddling to chase after the bubbles.

John Meek, the zoo's Animal Collections manager, said it was 'hilarious'.

'It was hilarious watching the penguins frantically waddling and swimming after the bubbles, trying to catch them.

'It was really entertaining for visitors too but more importantly it worked well as an enrichment tool which is a vital part of our animal welfare programme.'

The term animal enrichment refers to the process of providing stimulation to animals kept in enclosures. Keeping the animals active prevents boredom and encourages natural behaviour.

Although such programmes normally consists of branches, foliage and other natural materials, it can include toys and a type of treasure hunt using food hidden in hard to reach places.

The innovative entertainment was trialled with the penguins, macaques and squirrel monkeys.

However it's been so successful the zoo invested in its own bubble making machine and introduced regular sessions across the zoo.
