'After seven episodes of Fashion Police, I discovered that my style does not fit with the creative direction of the show and now it’s time to move on,' Kathy wrote, claiming that while she was happy to playfully tease people about their clothes, she did not want to 'contribute to a culture of unattainable perfectionism and intolerance towards difference'.
