Ayoze Perez says he could have joined Real Madrid or Barcelona, but chose Newcastle  because he wanted first-team football.

The 21-year-old star joined the club for £1.5million during the summer, and has become an instant hit at St James' Park after netting in wins against Tottenham Hotspur and Liverpool.

And he has no regrets in choosing Newcastle over one of the La Liga giants as, according to The Sun, he didn't want to get stuck in the reserves.  

Newcastle star Ayoze Perez admits he had interest from Real Madrid and Barcelona during the summer

The 21-year-old says he joined the club because he wanted to play first team football

'Yes, there was big interest from Real Madrid in particular - and some from Barcelona and Porto - but had I signed for one of these clubs would I have been playing in their first team?

'I could have ended up in their 'B' team so joining a big Premier League club seemed very much the right thing to do. 

'I liked Newcastle's approach and the way they treated me and appreciated me.'

Perez is set to be back in action as Newcastle travel to face Manchester United at Old Trafford on Boxing Day.
