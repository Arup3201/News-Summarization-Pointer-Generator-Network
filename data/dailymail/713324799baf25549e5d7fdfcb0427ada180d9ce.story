Former Labour MP Frank Cook used to describe his second wife as 'almost too perfect'. His four children from his first marriage, however, may beg to differ.

They were not surprised that, when Mr Cook died last year aged 76, his wife Somsangouane, an exiled Laotian princess, was the main beneficiary in his £340,000 will.

They were upset, however, that Mrs Cook – known as Sam – inherited everything. Mr Cook had stipulated that his estate would go to his grandchildren only if 70-year-old Sam died before him.

Expenses scandal: Labour MP Frank Cook claimed £153,902, including £5 for a charity donation

Mr Cook, one of the MPs who was caught up in the Commons expenses scandal, represented Stockton North for 27 years.

He died last January from lung cancer. His children say their relationship with his second wife became strained during his year-long illness and is now non-existent.

What has really upset his son, Andrew, 47, is that he and his sisters Christine, 51, Nicola, 48, and Maxine, 49, have not been given anything of worth to remember their father by.

The siblings had not received any of Mr Cook's possessions until a box arrived several weeks ago, he said.

'There was nothing meaningful there,' he said when the Daily Mail contacted him.

'My father always said that his watches would be mine and I know he had some expensive ones worth £300 to £400 but there was nothing like that in the box.

The whole contents could not have been worth more than £30. His grandchildren had to look through to try to find something to remember him by.

'We have had no contact with Sam even by email or telephone. We understand she has now moved away. I do not know where she is. To be honest, I don't care if I never see her again. She has taken the whole estate and disappeared.'

Mr Cook was still married to his first wife, Patricia, when in 1992 he met Somsangouane Baldinger, who was divorced and lived in Arizona, at Billingham folk festival in 1992. Mr Cook moved out of the family home in 1993 and was divorced five years later.

Family feud: Princess Somsangouane was made the main beneficiary of Mr Cook's £340,000 will

In an interview with his local newspaper in 2008, Mr Cook said of his second wife: 'She is almost too perfect. She's a lady of considerable skill and merit. She's never made me the same meal twice since we met. Heaven knows what she sees in me.'

The relationship landed him in trouble, however, when she refused to move to Teesside, saying it was too cold and she would miss her cocker spaniel. He was deselected by his local Labour party in 2008 for spending too much time abroad.

Around the same time it emerged that he had claimed expenses of £153,902. He sued the Sunday Telegraph over an article about how he had claimed £5 on Parliamentary expenses for a donation made by an aide representing him at a Battle of Britain service.

He said he made the claim by mistake but lost his case in 2011 and was left with a bill for costs which saw his estate reduced from £769,115 to £336,688. He stood as an independent in the 2010 General Election but finished fifth and lost his deposit.

Mr Cook was diagnosed with cancer in February 2011. His son said: 'He was pretty much home-bound for the last year. Sam would only let us in when she felt like she wanted to. It was kind of strained.

'The funeral was very trying because she didn't take our feelings into consideration.'

Although he had seen reports that his father and Sam married, he was unaware of any ceremony. 'We have never seen any certificate,' he said.

Mrs Cook did not respond to a request to comment which was put to her solicitor.
