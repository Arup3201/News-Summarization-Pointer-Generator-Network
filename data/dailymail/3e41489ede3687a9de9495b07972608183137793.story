Boris Johnson should be handed a Commons seat in time for the 2015 Election if David Cameron is to stand any chance of winning a majority, a Tory MP today argues in The Mail on Sunday.   

Nadine Dorries said that the Conservatives’ poor showing in Thursday’s Wythenshawe by-election – the party was pushed into third place by UKIP – demonstrated the need to bring the  London Mayor on board.  

Ms Dorries, writing in this paper, makes the point by likening Mr Johnson to a famous beer advert. ‘Boris is our Heineken,’ the Mid Bedfordsire MP says.

Boris Johnson is the Tory party's secret weapon, according to commentator Nadine Dorries, who argues that he should be made deputy PM should the Conservative party win the next election

‘He reaches parts of the electorate other politicians fail to reach.

Traditional Conservatives, women, Northerners and floating voters love him.’

Ms Dorries goes on to call Mr Johnson the ‘secret weapon’ who could ensure victory for Mr Cameron – and that he should then be rewarded with the job of Deputy Prime Minister.

‘Boris . . . is the only Conservative
 to have won a major election in 22 years. We are months away from the 
Euro elections and the party should have him out there on our screens,’ 
Ms Dorries writes.

Boris Johnson can reach areas of the public that the Tory party cannot usually reach, it has been claimed: An acquired taste

‘The truth is that Boris in a Westminster seat and on the campaign trail is a win-win for both men [Cameron and Johnson] and the entire country.

It should be their  selfless, ambition-free duty to make it happen.

‘If the Conservative Party does not win the next Election, then Cameron will stand down as leader.

It is inconceivable that there would be a leadership election without the people’s favourite politician...

To be part of that process, he needs to become an MP during or before 2015.’

Ms Dorries adds: ‘If Cameron does win a majority, which is much more likely with Boris at his side, then we can rejoice in having a Deputy Prime Minister who wants to control the power of the unions.’

Last week Mr Johnson addressed a private meeting of Tory backbenchers with the smallest majorities who  want to broaden the party’s electoral appeal.

Mr Johnson said the Tories must ‘own housing’ as an issue to win the next Election. 

He also told them the Tories  needed to make gains in the Midlands and North of England to triumph in 2015. 

One Tory MP who attended the meeting was quoted as saying: ‘You don’t need to be a chief code-cracker . . . to work out the meaning in Boris’s words.

He was saying I won two elections in London and, in the same way, there should be no “no-go areas”  in the rest of the country.’
