A second man in Vermont has died from a rare but deadly brain infection transmitted through mosquitoes. 

Scott Sgorbati, who was only 49, died from Eastern Equine Encephalitis (EEE), after spending weeks in intensive care. 

Only two weeks prior, 87-year-old Richard Hollis Breen died from the virus, which causes swelling of the brain.

Fatal disease: Scott Sgorbati, left, was the second person in Vermont to die of Eastern Equine Encephalitis in two weeks; the other was 87-year-old Richard Hollis Breen, right

Transmission: EEE is transmitted through mosquitoes, and although rare, is fatal in humans in a third of cases

Mr Sgorbati, who worked as a carpenter in the small town of Sudbury, was said to have been in good health before contracting EEE.

His death was confirmed earlier this week by the Vermont Department of Health.

His sister-in-law Susan Sgorbati told Vermont Public Radio that he was ‘very compassionate and always there for people.’

Following the two deaths, Vermont Health Commissioner Dr Harry Chen said that the disease is still extremely rare, saying there are on average only six cases a year.

‘What’s important now is that Vermonters are aware of EEE and take steps to avoid exposure,’ he said, according to the Addison County Independent.

Rarity: According to the CDC, there have been no reported cases of EEE between 1964 and 2010; Florida tops the list, with 70 reported cases since 1964

Precautions: EEE is transmitted through mosquitoes to humans; the CDC suggests wearing long sleeves and insect repellant when out of doors to avoid contact with the pests

He called the deaths of the two men ‘a tragedy,’ but added: ‘This is a very rare disease. The risks are low.’

Virus: EEE is a member of the genus Alphavirus, family Togaviridae

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there are two types of the illness.

Approximately a third of those infected die from the disease, but it is only fatal when it affects the central nervous system. 

The symptoms of EEE are often abrupt and severe, and can include fever, headache, irritability, restlessness, drowsiness, vomiting, convulsions, and in more serious cases, coma.

The most cases have been reported in Florida, with 70 cases reported since 1964. Next up was Massachusetts, with 37 cases. The CDC has no record of the disease in Vermont from 1964-2010.

Now Vermont health officials are looking forward to the temperature dropping, as a cold snap will likely kill off any mosquitos carrying the disease. 

Until then, officials advise those outside to thoroughly coat themselves in bug repellent, wearing long sleeves and trousers, not shorts.

They also say to avoid being outside at dusk and dawn, when mosquitoes are out in droves.
