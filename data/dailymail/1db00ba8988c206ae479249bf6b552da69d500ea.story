A devoted mother has had the chance to see her daughter as a young woman - 13 years after she was brutally murdered by her father. 

Kathy Brant, from Illinois, US, has had a photo of Lindsay Powell - who was killed in a vicious hammer attack at the age of four - aged digitally to imagine the face she would have had at 18.

‘She is absolutely beautiful. Every time I look at her, I feel full of hope,’ the 41-year-old said.

Kathy Brant had a picture made of Lindsay Powell as a young woman, digitally aged from childhood snaps 

Kathy was a happily married mother of four when her life tragically changed.   

On February 21, 1997 Kathy's ex-husband Joseph Bradley Powell, known as Brad, instigated a horrifying attack on his wife and children. 

The couple had been childhood sweethearts.  

Kathy said: ‘We lived next door to each other and he told me we’d live happily ever after. Then when I was five, his family moved away.’

Over the years she forgot about Brad only to run into him at a bar when she was 18. 

The couple soon married and shortly after, Kathy gave birth to Lindsay followed by sons, Joey, Anthony and Brandon, who was just a few months old when the attack took place.

‘It was just after Valentines. Brad had bought me a rose and I will still as in love with him as ever,' she said. 

'He’d promised me we’d live happily ever after, and as far as I was concerned that dream had come true.’

Brad’s half-brother, Eric, then 19, visited for one of his regular visits but Kathy had no notion of his real purpose that night. 

Kathy said: ‘Eric didn’t have much luck in love so he stayed with us often.’ 

‘The kids were in bed and we were enjoying a glass of wine when Eric offered to re-fill my glass. The next thing I remember is being hit and then everything went black.’ 

In fact, Kathy stayed conscious enough to scream as Eric hit her over the head 12 times with a hammer and then a dumbbell, before stabbing her in the neck.

Police thought the noise must have disturbed her two oldest children Lindsay and Joey, who got up to see what was happening.

‘Apparently, when they refused to go back to bed, Brad flipped and attacked them with the hammer.

‘My mum told me Lindsay had died when I woke in the hospital. Joey survived but with brain injuries.’

Police later told Kathy that they'd found proof that Brad was having an affair.

She said: ‘Brad planned it all but was too afraid to kill me himself. He got Eric to do it. When they tried to get away they crashed their car and the registration plate led officers to our address.

'What they found was carnage. Lindsay was already gone. Poor Joey was clinging to life and I was unconscious, my skull caved in.

‘Days later, I held Lindsay’s funeral, lost in grief. I was haunted by one question – why? It didn’t make any sense. Why would Brad want to hurt me and the kids?

‘Focusing all my energies on Joey, I nursed him until he was allowed home a month later. He had a titanium plate fitted into his head. He suffered seizures and brain damage. I promised him we’d get through it.’

It took a year for the case to go to court. 

‘Police said they’d found love letters from Brad to another woman,’ Kathy said. ‘Rather than leaving me, he’d wanted me dead. I wanted to scream, but why hurt Lindsay?’

On 13 February 1998, Joseph Bradley Powell, 25, was found guilty of two counts of attempted murder and one of murder.

He was sentenced to 54 years in prison.

His brother Eric Sutton was jailed for 47 years on the same charges.

Kathy was finally granted a divorce soon after and had Brad’s parental rights revoked.

She had received justice but Kathy couldn't cope with the guilt of surviving while Lindsay died and the sheer difficulty of caring for Joey.

‘I tortured myself with every detail. I kept thinking it should be me not Lindsay who was dead.

‘Looking after Joey was very hard and eventually I had a nervous breakdown,’ she said.

A friend offered to help her, and now Kathy says she has a great relationship with Joey, 20, Anthony, 19, and Brandon, 17.

Her sons have even helped her rebuild her life and she has become an ardent campaigner against child abuse.

Kathy commissioned the picture of Lindsay as an adult smiling down on her to help start looking to the future. 

She said: ‘I sent one of her photos to a professional, who sent back an image of what she might look like today.

‘It hangs proudly on my living room wall. Having her look down on me makes me feel closer to her.

‘It reminds me that things do move on. For Lindsay’s sake, I won’t let Brad ruin my life any more. 

'Anyone I can help now means my girl’s life wasn’t lost in vain.’
