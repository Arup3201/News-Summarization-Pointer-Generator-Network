Patients and staff were forced to flee from a hospital, including an operating theatre, this evening as a fire tore through one of its buildings.

A major blaze broke out in the ground floor of a building housing an £800,000 MRI scanner and two CT scanners at around 4pm as medical teams rushed to get patients to safety.

Around 55 patients were evacuated from the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester with some forced to move mid-operation.

Drama: Smoke billows across the skyline as firefighters tackle the blaze at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital this evening which forced patients and staff to evacuate the building

Big response: More than sixty firefighters and three vehicles with aerial platforms were used at the height of the blaze

Most were transported to other wards although some patients being treated for less serious illnesses were told they could go home 'at their own risk'.

Both police and hospital officials have said that no-one was injured by the fire.

Ten fire engines and three vehicles with aerial ladder platforms rushed to the scene as the hospital was reported to be well alight.

Patients were being moved to other parts of the hospital while the accident and emergency department was closed to ambulances.

Discussing tactics: Firefighters gather next to an ambulance

Hospital staff said that the MRI and CT unit was some way away from the main wards.

A hospital spokesman said: 'The fire took hold in the MRI department at about 4pm.

'We're not sure how it started yet and it will be something for the fire service to investigate.

'Fifty-five patients were moved from A&E, medical imaging and the operating theatre to other parts of the hospital.

'I'm not sure what operations were taking place when the fire started.

'There were no casualties and the fire service remain on the site, but it (the fire) is under control.'

She expected the A&E department to remain closed until tomorrow morning.

The A&E department remained closed tonight and ambulances were being diverted to Southampton and Basingstoke.

Traffic
around the hospital ground to a halt as police closed Romsey Road, a 
major route through the city centre, where the hospital is situated.

Great escape: Around 55 patients were evacuated from the X-ray and A&E departments, five operating theatres and the intensive care units at the Winchester hospital

'We
are assisting the fire service with road closures around Romsey Road 
following the hospital fire,' said a spokesman from Hampshire Police.

'Motorists in Winchester are advised to find alternative routes around Romsey Road and St James Road and expect delays.

'Traffic at the moment there is gridlocked.'

Dr
Chris Gordon, acting chief executive of the trust that runs the 
hospital, said: 'My understanding is that we've had a fire in the MRI 
and CT scanner room and maybe in the roof of the building.

'We have evacuated the X-ray department, accident and emergency and five operating theatres and the intensive care units.

'There was surgery going on at the time and those patients have also had to be evacuated.

'As far as I know no one has been injured and no one has come to harm as a consequence of that evacuation.'

One of expensive scanners thought to have been destroyed by flames had only been used at the hospital since February 2009.

The hospital's MRI scanner was officially unveiled in March of that year by Vendee Globe yachtswoman Dee Caffari.

The installation of the scanner at a cost of £800,000 followed a major investment programme which also saw a £700,000 CT scanner purchased in 2007.

The Royal Hampshire County Hospital serves most of central Hampshire and was founded in 1736.

It opened at its current site in 1868 after Queen Victoria contributed to the appeal to finance the hospital and allowed it to carry the name 'Royal'.
