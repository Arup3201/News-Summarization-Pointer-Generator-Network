PUPCAKES

Ingredients

Method

In
 a large mixing bowl, blend the water, egg, carrots, vanilla and honey. 
Add the mashed banana. In a separate bowl mix flour, baking powder, 
nutmeg and cinnamon. Combine mixtures and mix thoroughly. Fill each 
cupcake case three-quarters full. Bake at 350F (175C) for 30 minutes. 
'Ice' with low-fat cream cheese.

VEGAN, GLUTEN-FREE TREATS

Ingredients

Method

Preheat oven to 324F (165C). In a mixing bowl combine flour, oat and baking powder, making a well in the centre. In a separate bowl place your carrots and dates, adding the peanut butter and water, and stir. Add the peanut mix into the well you made, and stir until combined. Flour a surface and flatten the mix to make a 1/4 inch-thick layer. Cut shapes with a cookie cutter and bake for 14-16 minutes. Cool for 30 minutes and then serve. Woof!

MILK BONE BISCUITS
