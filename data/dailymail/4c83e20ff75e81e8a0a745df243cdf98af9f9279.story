Groomed to be stars: PE teacher Stephen Benson, 50, allegedly raped two 15-year-old girls and abused a 14-year-old

A former national athletics coach raped two girls he trained and promised to make sports stars, a court heard today.

PE teacher Stephen Benson, 50, allegedly groomed his victims by taking control of their lives, going on family holidays with them and promising to turn them into future athletics stars.

Ipswich Crown Court heard how he allegedly raped two 15-year-old girls, suggesting to one that he would no longer coach her if she did not have sex with him.

A third alleged victim was also repeatedly abused at the age of 14 at her family home after Benson became a regular visitor.

Benson of Copdock near Ipswich, Suffolk, denies 11 charges of rape, six of indecent assault, two of sexual activity with a child and two of sexual assault between 1989 and 2010.

Prosecutor Riel Karmy-Jones said: ‘This case is about the misuse of power by an older man against those who looked up to him and saw him as their mentor.

‘For a period of over 20 years, he abused his position of trust by grooming a series of girls for his own benefit and sexual gratification.

‘He also groomed parents as well as children. They liked him and he wormed his way into their lives. He was initially charming and expressed an interest in their daughters' talents.

‘What parent would not have felt the same when told that their daughter might become a great star?

‘He would go to the girls' rooms to discuss their training and would stay longer and later. His visits became more regular and he even managed to go on holidays with families.

‘He inveigled himself into families and their lives, so he was able to gain control of the girls. He made them feel that running was the only thing that mattered and they must do his bidding.

‘He controlled their diet, sleeping and social lives and manipulated them so he could sexually abuse them.’

The court heard how the alleged victims were now all adults but had never met each other.

Benson was said to have carried out his abuse while he was a PE teacher at Copleston High School in Ipswich and a coach at the Ipswich Harriers running club.

He was described in court as 'a high ranking athletics' coach and worked as a national cross-country coach for UK Athletics training athletes for national and international events

The alleged offences came to light after his last alleged victim decided to report him.

Miss Karmy-Jones told officers how 
Benson had invited the girl to join his 'elite runners club' several 
years previously and befriended her mother.

He
became a regular visitor to her home for evening meals and began saying
goodnight to her in her room at night, she said. Benson started off by 
stroking her back before trying to force her hand on his genitals and 
rubbing her breasts on the pretext of carrying out a sports massage, she
added.

Miss Karmy-Jones 
said the girl was embarrassed and felt his behaviour was 'wrong and 
disgusting', but she went along with it because she wanted him to be her
coach.

Police later visited a woman who was coached by Benson several years earlier. When the officers told her they were reinvestigating him, she put her head in her hands and started to sob.

She told officers how Benson regularly visited her home, tried to control her diet and stopped her seeing friends.

He allegedly began stroking her hair, the holding her hand when they went out before having sex with her six to eight times, said Miss Karmy-Jones.

Benson allegedly told her: ‘I will stop training you if you don't do it.’

Miss Karmy-Jones added: ‘Running was something she as good at. It became her life and she didn't want to stop. He made her feel it was a real threat hanging over her.’

He had sex with her in her bedroom, at his parents' home, in his car and in Thetford forest, she said.

She said: ‘As she became older she realised it was not normal. He would listen to George Michael in his car. Now if she listens to George Michael, she has to turn it off because it makes her feel sick.

‘He did not use force of a physical nature, but it was coercion of a man in power and authority.

‘She did not consent to sex with him, but she knew if she didn't he would make her life hell. She didn't report it to police at the time because she was embarrassed and did not think she would be believed.'

A second woman who was visited to police also told officers how Benson had sex with her when she was aged 15, even though she never consented.

She said that Benson also befriended her family and exerted power and control over her.

The
woman told officers that Benson had originally forced her to perform 
sex acts on him when they were alone and later had full sex with her.

Miss Karmy-Jones said: ‘She was aware that it was not right - but she was his protégé and he was her mentor.’

When arrested over the most recent alleged abuse, Benson denied any wrongdoing and claimed that the girl had formed 'a crush' on him and had idolised him.

Later he admitted having consensual sex with the other two teenagers but said it happened when they were aged over 16 and it was not illegal at the time.

Miss Karmy-Jones said: ‘Submitting to sex is not necessarily the same as consent. It is the Crown's case that these young women did not consent, accept for the pressure put on them.

‘The defendant may have had genuine feelings for them, but those feelings were misplaced because of his age and position. ‘What he did was wrong on any moral compass.’

The trial continues.
