She arrived in Paris on the Eurostar last night donning a bizarre beanie and gun necklace combination, but Cara Delevingne adopted a much more demure style as she took to the catwalk today.

The 21-year-old model of the moment walked in the hotly anticipated Stella McCartney show on day five of Paris Fashion Week.

Hot on the heels of the bushy-browed young model was industry heavyweight and ex-Victoria's Secret Angel, Miranda Kerr.

Watched by the likes of Salma Hayek and, of course, Sir Paul McCartney (whose tardiness caused the show to run late), the duo looked a vision in McCartney's sheer and opaque s/s14 collection.

Known and loved for her ability to capture the mood of the season in her wearable designs, McCartney sent models - including Joan Smalls - down the catwalk in racy lace, luxe sportswear and some seriously sexy masculine tailoring.

It was her typical nod to female empowerment but much more romantic, confident and sassy for spring/summer 14.

Highlights of her collection, which 
echoed the new wave of Brit girl, included racer backed dresses with 
super clinched waists complete with chiffon, lace and pretty florals. which were toughened up with zippered suiting.

Oh-so-now
masculine tailoring is McCartney's signature style and she updated it 
with strong, boxy shoulders and broad, fluid silk trousers and dresses 
were effortlessly pretty.

'An
accent on understated seduction. Fluid silhouettes play on transparency
and opacity in line with the body,' read the show notes.

Stella's iconic boy-meets-girl approach was witnessed in the form of fluid tunic dresses and cream silk trouser suits, whilst fitted bomber jackets and sheer, loosely fitted skirts added some sex appeal.

The colour pallette was feminine with tones of  peach, navy and cream and accessories came in the form of cat-eyed sunglasses, oversized clutches and sporty shoes to complement her sports luxe designs.

'The collection is very much a celebration of summer, of the Stella woman,' Stella McCartney told Vogue.co.uk after her show this morning.

'I wanted to take a really honest approach. We've redefined the silhouette to take on a slightly more slim-line shape and we have these subtle windows onto the body because I wanted to use fabric in a way that really speaks about the woman wearing it - rather than it wearing her, I want it to work for her.'

'No matter what you wear from Stella - whether it's a dress or a tracksuit - you feel a sense of elegance without having to try," Cara told Vogue afterwards.

'I want to take it all home with me,' added Miranda Kerr. 'It's all so chic, but it's always really wearable.'
