A holiday resort in Thailand has come under fire after it posted a picture online of drunken guests riding a baby elephant around its swimming pool.

The picture, which drew widespread criticism immediately after it was posted, was accompanied by a caption that stated it was ‘amazing Sunday brunch’.

Nikki Beach Resort in Phuket was flooded with complaints over the photo, reports The Daily Telegraph.

A holiday resort in Thailand has come under fire after it posted a picture online of drunken guests riding an elephant around its swimming pool

Nikki Beach Resort in Phuket published the picture along with a caption that stated it was ‘amazing Sunday brunch’

People were enraged such a young elephant had been brought onto the property so that guests could ride it for fun, and that guests were more than willing to take part.

The resort quickly deleted the photo, and released a statement to address the controversy.

'We would like to make it clear that we do not, have not and will never own an elephant,' the statement read. 

'The elephant in the photo is from a reputable elephant caretaker who has no affiliation with Nikki Beach. 

The resort is located about 30 minutes away from the tourist hot-spot of Patong

'Elephants are a highly respected and regarded symbol of Thailand. As a global company, Nikki Beach respects every country’s culture and traditions and as such, we fall into the normal behaviors in usage of elephants to represent their culture. 

'We never intended to be disrespectful.' 

The statement did little to calm the stampeding herd of online protesters, and the anger spilled onto the resort's TripAdvisor page. However, TripAdvisor deleted negative reviews based on the elephant incident.

'We would like to make it clear that we do not, have not and will never own an elephant,' a statement from the resort read
