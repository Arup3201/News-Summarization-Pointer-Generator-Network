A red deer stag peers out from behind the trees of a pine forest during a snow blizzard in the Cairngorms; a flock of northern gannets and a pod of killer whales feed in the wake of a trawler off the Shetland Islands; a seal pup rests on a sandbank during a sandstorm at Donna Nook nature reserve, Lincs.

These are just a few of the stunning images of natural Britain featured in a new exhibition that documents the best of the 2020VISION wildlife photography project.

The exhibition will run throughout May on the South Bank of the River Thames in London, and features the work of some of Britain's top wildlife photographers.

The images were taken at different conservation projects across the country. Organisers believe the exhibition tells an "inspirational" story about some of the UK's most vital ecosystems.

The images include stunning shots of some of the country's rarest air, sea, and land animals, as well as national parks, nature reserves and mountain ranges.
