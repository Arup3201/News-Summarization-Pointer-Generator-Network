Stephen Fry has married his partner Elliott Spencer, ten days after announcing their engagement.

The 57-year-old took to Twitter to share the happy news, posting a photograph of he and his stand-up comedian husband signing the civil register in Dereham, Norfolk. 

He accompanied the picture with the caption: 'Gosh.@ElliottGSpencer and I go into a room as two people, sign a book and leave as one. Amazing.'

Stephen Fry has married partner Elliott Spencer, sharing the happy news with his 8 million followers online 

 Later Mr Fry shared this photograph, saying the wedding had been 'witnessed by a mini Oscar Wilde'

His groom quickly retweeted the image to the joy of their millions of followers.  

Dressed in a grey suit with a multi-coloured tie, the actor is seen gazing lovingly at Mr Spencer, who is 30 years his junior. 

It is not known how many people were in attendance, though Mr Fry this evening joked their vows had been witnessed by an Oscar Wilde doll.  

'Oh and @ElliottGSpencer and I had our vows witnessed by a mini Oscar Wilde. Because one should.'

Wilde, who was imprisoned for gross indecency after embarking on an affair with the son of the Marquis of Queensberry in 1895, is one of Fry's most famous roles. 

In reference to the flowers pinned through their button holes, the actor accompanied his tweet with the message: #greencarnations. 

The gesture was an homage to the British writer whose 19th Century followers wore the flowers. Mr Fry and Mr Spencer are understood to have married in the Mitford Suite at Dereham Register Office in Norfolk, near to the former's country home.

Hugh Laurie led congratulatory messages shared on Twitter, with Nigella Lawson and Derren Brown also sharing their good wishes

The Norfolk County Council website describes the ground floor Mitford Suite ceremony room as the 'outstanding feature' of the 1980s style building.

It says: 'Decorated in a modern style, in shades of turquoise, lilac and purple, there is seating for 40 people.'

Earlier in the day Mr Fry hinted at their nuptials, claiming he would be going to a 'banquet' before watching Norwich City play Cardiff City. 

'Gulp! @Ronnieo147 v @nr147 this afternoon @BBCSnooker. A banquet. And then @NorwichCityFC v @CardiffCityFC - good things… #BBCSnooker.' 

Derren Brown was among the first to congratulate the couple once news of their wedding was shared, responding to the photograph with: 'Gor.geous xxx'. 

Actor Hugh Laurie added: 'Bloody hell it's happened! @ElliottGSpencer has made an honest man of m'col. Love and happiness to all!!' 

Upon news of their engagement, Mr Fry said he had hoped for a private wedding.

Confirming their then pending nuptials on January 6, he shared on Twitter: 'Oh. It looks as though a certain cat is out of a certain bag.

'I'm very very happy of course but had hoped for a private wedding. Fat chance!'

'Thank you all SO much for your kind congratulations. Deeply touched xxx'. 

Mr Spencer added: 'Thank you for all the lovely messages :) x x x'. Two days later he wrote: 'Feeling slightly frazzled but very happy. May possibly hide behind the sofa...' 

Asked the date of the wedding, Mr Fry said: 'Now, we won't be giving that away. And I'm sorry to say you won't be invited. It will be some time this year, as you have to give a year's notice.'

Upon news of their engagement, Mr Spencer's parents said they were 'over the moon' to welcome the television star into their family. 

Mr Spencer's father Robert, who at 57 is the same age as his new son-in-law, said he and his wife Melanie, 52, are 'over the moon'.

'We are obviously very happy. We are over the moon, that is all I want to say.'

Overjoyed: The couple debuted matching engagement rings in London just over a week ago

They were seen leaving Mr Fry's London home earlier this month in his Bentley after announcing their engagement

The following day the pair were seen at Cwmbran Magistrates Court in South Wales where Spencer was banned from driving 

The following day Mr Spencer was banned from driving after travelling at 101mph in his partner's Aston Martin.

The pair were on their way to a literary festival when the actor reportedly told his then fiance to 'put your foot down'. 

Mr Spencer was accompanied by the 57-year-old at Cwmbran Magistrates' Court in South Wales just 24 hours after announcing their engagement. 

The previous day he was seen crashing Mr Fry's Bentley in London. 

Mr Fry campaigned in the past for gay marriage to be made legal, slamming its critics by saying there were 260 species of animals which suggested homosexual tendencies. 

'At least 260 species of animal have been noted exhibiting homosexual behaviour but only one species of animal ever, so far as we know, has exhibited homophobic behaviour — and that’s the human being,' he said in the video for Out4Marriage.

'So ask which is really natural.' 

In the same year he admitted to trying to kill himself following the break-up of his previous relationship.

Mr Fry, who suffers from bipolar disorder, revealed that in 2012 he tried to commit suicide with a cocktail of vodka and pills, and was only saved by a producer who discovered him.

Friends have credited Mr Spencer with putting a smile back on the actor's face following a crippling battle with depression.

One friend said: 'We've got the old Stephen back. He has found new hope in Elliott and they thrive off each other.'

The star spent 14 years with former make-up and vitamin salesman Daniel Cohen before they split in 2010. 

Previously he has spoken of his struggle with depression and loneliness. 

In 2013 he said: 'Loneliness is the most terrible and contradictory of my problems. I hate having only myself to come home to.'

'It's not that I want a sexual partner, a long-term partner, someone to share a bed and a snuggle on the sofa with – although perhaps I do and in the past I have had and it has been joyful. 

Mr Spencer's parents previously told of their joy over the couple's engagement, saying they were 'over the moon' their son was to marry the QI star

The comedian previously posted photographs with his 'heroes' Jimmy Carr and David Mitchell

'But the fact is I value my privacy too. It's a lose-lose matter.' 

Last year he also spoke openly about his battle with drugs and claimed he took cocaine at Buckingham Palace.

Opening up about a 15-year addiction to the Class A drug, the comedian details dozens of respected institutions where he says he took it. The list included the House of Lords, the House of Commons and BBC Television Centre.

In his latest autobiography, More Fool Me, published in September, Fry wrote: 'I take this opportunity to apologise unreservedly, to the owners, managers or representatives of the noble and ignoble premises and to the hundreds of private homes, offices, car dashboards, tables, mantelpieces and available polished surfaces that could so easily have been added to this list of shame'.

Following on from 2010's The Fry Chronicles, which touched on his drug use in its closing pages, his new book sees the presenter speak in detail about the habit that cost him hundreds of thousands of pounds.

It also reveals his brushes with the law and how he narrowly escaped drug charges after being stopped by police while in possession of cocaine.

This third instalment of his autobiography follows Fry through the 1980s and 90s after he had found fame through shows such as A Bit of Fry and Laurie, Blackadder and Jeeves and Wooster.

He recalls the 'momentous night' in 1986 when he first took cocaine with an unnamed actor friend and admits that he never saw himself as an addict as his dependency spiralled out of control.'
