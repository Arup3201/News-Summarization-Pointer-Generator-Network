A woman who accused Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein of groping her breasts has been identified as a 22-year-old model who witnessed an orgy involving disgraced former Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi.

Weinstein, 63, was questioned by the NYPD this weekend over the alleged fondling of former beauty queen Ambra Battilana, who was identified by Page Six on Monday. The movie producer allegedly put his hand up the model's skirt and asked for a kiss at a business meeting on Friday, said the Post. 

A source close to The Weinstein Company told Page Six the groping allegations were nothing more than a 'blackmail attempt' and insisted that the award-winning producer 'did nothing wrong'.

Battilana previously told Italian authorities about witnessing a so-called 'bunga-bunga' orgy involving Berlusconi at his Milan mansion in 2010. She claimed she had seen young models performing stripteases and baring their breasts to be kissed by the Italian leader during a raunchy dinner party.

On Friday, the model reportedly told police that Weinstein, who is married with five children, touched her breasts and thigh at the Tribeca Film Center in Manhattan.
