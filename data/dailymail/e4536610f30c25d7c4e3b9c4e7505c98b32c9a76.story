The soaring Sydney property market will achieve growth of 20 per cent over two years to send the median house price above $1 million, new research suggests.

Prices are also set to take off in Brisbane, but growth will be much more subdued in Melbourne and Adelaide, and prices will fall in Perth, according to forecasts from BIS Shrapnel.

The economic analysts say there are housing shortages in Sydney and southeast Queensland, and while housing construction activity has lifted, there is limited scope for a long run of growth in construction.

Sydney house prices have grown by almost 14 per cent in the year to February, according to Australian Bureau of Statistics data, and BIS Shrapnel expects annual growth of 13 per cent for the 2014/15 financial year.

A further seven per cent rise is forecast for 2015/16, which would take the median price to $980,000 and could see it rise above $1 million by 2017.

BIS Shrapnel senior manager of residential property Angie Zigomanis said the prices would rise due to interest rate cuts and undersupply.

'There's strong investor demand in Sydney, and in our view we still think there's an undersupply of dwellings,' Mr Zigomanis told Daily Mail Australia.

'There's also probably just an element of FOMO [fear of missing out] there.

'Buyers are worried the market will run ahead of them and they won't be able to get what they want in the area they want.'

Brisbane prices are expected to post 14 per cent growth over two years - six per cent growth in the current financial year and eight per cent growth in 2015/16 - which would take the median price to $540,000.

Mr Zigomanis said the populations of Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth were being affected by fewer arrivals and more departures.

But he said this change would not hit Brisbane house prices, as construction has been weak and has fallen behind population growth.

BIS Shrapnel is tipping Melbourne to post a slow price growth of three per cent in 2014/15, and just two per cent in the following 12 months, which would see the median house price at $685,000 in June 2016.

'It comes down to demand and supply - Melbourne has had extended periods of strong [housing] supply,' Mr Zigomanis said.

'[The market] is imbalanced, and slowly tipping to oversupply. And there are still a lot of new construction projects so supply will remain high.'

Mr Zigomanis said declines in mining investment would contribute to falls in Perth house prices, with BIS Shrapnel forecasting a one per cent drop this year and a two per cent fall in 2015/16 to see the media house price hit $530,000. 

'Perth's had a very strong surge in building, but vacancy rates are rising as people [in the mining industry] leave to go back overseas or back to their home states.'

Adelaide's market is also set to slow, with growth of one per cent in the current financial year and two per cent in 2015/16. Median house prices are predicted to get to $435,000 in June 2016.

Melbourne is tipped to post a slow price growth of three per cent in 2014/15, and just two per cent in the following 12 months

BIS Shrapnel said falling interest rates were unlikely to affect house prices as much as housing construction activity.

'For many prospective borrowers the decision on whether to enter the property market or not has already been made and an additional 0.25 per cent off their mortgage will not be enough to change their behaviour,' it said.

'It will probably encourage some purchasers around the fringes, providing a mild boost to the market.

'Activity has already found a momentum of its own which is set to continue for another two years.'

Declines in mining investment will contribute to falls in Perth prices, with BIS Shrapnel forecasting a three per cent drop by June 2016
