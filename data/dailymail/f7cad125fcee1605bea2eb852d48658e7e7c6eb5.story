Formula One will return to Mexico for the first time in 23 years after it was announced the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez will be included on the 2015 calendar.

There have been long-standing reports that F1 supremo Bernie Ecclestone has been negotiating with those who could put the wheels in motion for a comeback to the Mexico City location and now events company Corporacion Interamericana de Entretenimiento (CIE) have confirmed a five-year deal has been struck.

'It is a fact,' CIE president Alejandro Soberon told a press conference at the Banamex Centre.

'Start your engines, F1 will return to Mexico next year. This is Mexico's time.'

Ecclestone was not present at the announcement but did send a message echoing the comments of Soberon and welcoming Mexico back into the F1 fold.

'After 23 years of absence, I am pleased to confirm that Formula One will be back in Mexico City in 2015,' he said.

'I feel it is the right for F1 for and Mexico and I'm sure it will be to the benefit of both for many years. I look forward to welcoming you all to this global event next year.'

The Williams of Nigel Mansell won the 1992 race with the Brit on his way to the drivers' championship, but the F1 fraternity has not returned since.

A gap in the calendar, as well as taking logistics into account, means it is likely the race will run back-to-back with the United States Grand Prix held in Austin, Texas - although a concrete date is yet to be decided.

It was confirmed that alterations and improvements will be made to the track, with spectator stands and pit garages also undergoing renovations to comply with FIA regulations.

A grand prix around the streets of Azerbaijan capital Baku is also expected to be included from next year, which promises to present a packed season for the teams and drivers - with other races now likely to be unsure of their own respective futures on the calendar.

Two drivers who will be hoping to be part of the long-awaited return will be the Mexican pair of Sergio Perez of Force India and Sauber's Esteban Gutierrez who would no doubt help draw a huge crowd, with organisers hoping for 180,000 spectators to attend over the three-day events.
