A Martian meteorite dug up by Bedouin tribesmen in the Sahara dates back almost 4.5 billion years and could contain the secret to the red planet once harbouring life.

The rock is believed to be the oldest recognised sample of soil from Mars and holds a wealth of information about its origin and age.

It also provides clues about the release of volatiles - chemicals linked to a planet's water - with evidence about the first 100 million years of the planet's existence.

A meteorite from Northwest Africa called NWA 7533 may be the first recognized example of ancient Martian crust, according to data presented in Nature this week

Using spectrometers - which can identify thousands of different chemicals - scientists discovered high concentrations of trace metals such as iridium which showed the sample is the first to come from Mars' southern highlands.

The meteorite called NWA 7533 after its landing spot of North West Africa was part of a celestial rock that broke up on entering Earth's atmosphere producing at least five recovered stones.

Another sample - known as 7034 and nicknamed 'Black Beauty' - was dated earlier this year at 2.1 billion years old but the new age of 4.4 billion years is based on minerals called zircons providing evidence of an early differentiation of the Martian crust in the first 100 million years of its history.

Professor Munir Humayun said: 'The early magmatic build-up of the Martian highland crust requires an equally rapid release of volatiles from the Martian interior - forming the early atmosphere and hydrosphere (water found on, under and over the surface) - with implications for early Martian climate and biological potential.'

The fist-sized meteorite nicknamed Black Beauty, could unlock vital clues to the evolution of Mars from the warm and wet place it once was to its current cold and dry state

Like Earth the red planet is 'differentiated' in it has a central core of metallic iron and nickel surrounded by a less dense, silicate mantle and crust. Its distinctive colour is due to the oxidation of iron on its surface.

It might not just be men who are from Mars - a recent study suggests that all life on Earth began on the red planet too.

An element believed to be crucial to the origin of life would only have been available on the surface of Mars, it is claimed.

Geochemist Professor Steven Benner has argued that the 'seeds' of life probably arrived on Earth in meteorites blasted off Mars by impacts or volcanic eruptions.

As evidence, he points to the oxidised mineral form of the element molybdenum, thought to be a catalyst that helped organic molecules develop into the first living structures.

‘In addition, recent studies show that these conditions, suitable for the origin of life, may still exist on Mars,’ said Professor Benner, of the Westheimer Institute for Science and Technology in Gainesville, Florida.

‘It’s only when molybdenum becomes highly oxidised that it is able to influence how early life formed.

‘This form of molybdenum couldn’t have been available on Earth at the time life first began, because three billion years ago the surface of the Earth had very little oxygen, but Mars did.

‘It’s yet another piece of evidence which makes it more likely life came to Earth on a Martian meteorite, rather than starting on this planet.’

The zircons in the meteorite were probably formed by re-melting of the original Martian crust, says Professor Munir Humayan. Their similarity with the earliest terrestrial and lunar zircons suggests Mars' crust form at the same time as Earth and Moon.

Professor Humayan, if Florida State University, said: 'This cratered terrain has been long thought to hold the keys to Mars' birth and early childhood.

'This date is about 100 million years after the first dust condensed in the solar system.

'We now know Mars had a crust within the first 100 million years of the start of planet building and its crust formed concurrently with the oldest crusts on Earth and the Moon.'

The researchers, who findings are published in the journal Nature, were also able to calculate the thickness of the planet's crust and say their trailblazing discoveries are just the tip of the iceberg.

Further studies could reveal more clues about the impact history of Mars, the nature of Martian zircons and the make-up of the earliest sediments on the Red Planet.

Leading meteorite expert Prof Harry McSween, of Tennessee University, who reviewed the study, said: 'The real surprise is the ancient age reported for NWA 7533 - 4.4 billion years - demonstrating it is a sample of the earliest Martian crust."

Many of the Martian meteorites that exist today have been found in the Sahara by Bedouin tribesmen who know the rocks can fetch a pretty price in the marketplace of Casablanca.

And that's where the five stones eventually surfaced. Three were bought by a wealthy American collector while at least one was bought by a Frenchman who suspected it was somehow different and sent it to Prof Humayan via a museum in Paris.

Since its discovery Black Beauty's value has jumped from $50 a gram to $15,000 a gram - and now could soar
