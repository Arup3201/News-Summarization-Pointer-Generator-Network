A prisoner tried to sue for compensation after claiming he had rolled off his bunk bed in his sleep.

Drug dealer Callum Foster tried to claim £6,000 in damages after he alleged that he had been injured after falling from a bunk bed

Drug dealer, Callum Foster, 22, launched a bid for up to £6,000 in damages saying he had suffered head injuries at the Category A prison in Manchester.

But the hapless convict was convicted of fraud and handed an extra nine months on his original sentence.

Foster will serve the sentence on top of the three years he is already serving for peddling heroin.

Yesterday a prison insider said: ‘The stupidity of some people really knows no bounds.

‘It begs belief that while serving a sentence for one crime he would try to commit another of such crass idiocy - he quite clearly hasn’t learned the lesson yet.’

Callum Foster, 22, was jailed last year after being convicted of dealing heroin on the streets of Manchester.

But days after being incarcerated he read a lawyer’s advertisement in a prison newspaper and hatched on a plan to sue the authorities for up to £6,000.

He claimed he had suffered a nasty bump to his head after he accidentally rolled out of his top bunk bed while asleep and fell five feet to the floor of his cell.

Foster even told prison wardens he had carried on sleeping and had not woken up despite the fall.

But his cunning plan came unstitched when medical records revealed he already had a bump on his head before the accident was supposed to have happened.

Foster, of Blackley, Manchester denied fraud at Manchester Crown Court but was found guilty after a trial.

The court heard that on April Fool's Day last year Foster, while on remand for assault charges, was restrained for thuggish behaviour towards staff and when a nurse saw him later she noted a bump on his head.

But in June last year, while Foster was back in the prison for the supply of heroin, the prison authorities got a letter from personal injury lawyers Michael Jefferies, which claimed Foster had fallen from his bunk and sustained injuries to his neck, shoulder, back and head.

Foster hadn’t complained of any injuries at the time of the bogus fall and had not alerted staff.

The claim, the court heard, was worth about £6,000 - but could have cost the taxpayer up to £35,000 to defend.

Strangeways’ prison litigation team, which the court heard deals with 120 claims of this type at ‘any given time’, called in Greater Manchester Police’s prison crime specialist to investigate Foster, before pursuing him for fraud.

Foster claimed in his trial that despite falling five feet to the ground, he continued sleeping, only realising he had fallen when his cellmate told him.

His compensation claim alleged negligence because there was no safety rail on the bed.

The court heard he has previous convictions stretching back to 2007, including for grievous bodily harm,

John Wolfson, defending, said of Foster’s offence: ‘He gained nothing from it apart from a criminal conviction.’

Handing him a further nine months behind bars, Judge Robert Atherton told Foster: ‘No-one should be under any illusion about the lack of resources public services have.

‘Any such drain on public resources is to be abhorred - particularly by someone who has such an anti-social history as you have, with the convictions you have.’

Foster has now been handed a total of three years nine months behind bars after being found guilty of fraud. Foster is being held at Strangeways Category A prison in Manchester (pictured here)

Compensation payments to prisoners cost the taxpayer up to £13million each year.

But prison authorities now have specialist legal teams who are called in to root out fraudulent claims.

Last year Noel Jennings, 23, claimed he had slipped on water outside his cell at Strangeways prison and hit his head

He, tried to sue for £6,000 but his scam was uncovered by prison bosses and he was jailed for two years for perverting the course of justice following a hearing at Manchester Crown Court.

In 2012, one prisoner who had taken part in a rooftop protest at a prison in Belfast attempted to sue because he got sunburn.

Drugs baron Simon Price, 68, an Orthodox Jew who was jailed for trying to smuggle £35million worth of cocaine into Britain, launched legal action last year for £2,500 compensation against Frankland Prison in Durham for failing to provide him with equipment to cook Kosher meals.
