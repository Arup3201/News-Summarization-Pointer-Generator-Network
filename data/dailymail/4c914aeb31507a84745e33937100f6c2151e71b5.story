A video has emerged showing desperate shoppers elbowing each other out of the way to get their hands on cut-price Rachael Ray cookware at Walmart - in just one example of Black Friday mania.

The video of women scrambling for boxes of the sets in Turkey Creek in Knoxville, Tennessee was taken by fellow shopper Bob Newman just after the store threw open its doors, WATE reported.

They are desperate to get their hands on the 15-piece cookware set, which inclues saucepans, stockpot, pans and skillets, for $89 - reduced from $199.99.

Scrap: Crowds battle to get their hands on a cut-down Rachael Ray cookware set in Tennessee

Desperate: Some shoppers scream and try to grab the boxes from other people's hands amid the frenzy

After grabbing the boxes, some women 
continue to battle over them - screaming as some customers try to 
pinch them from their hands.

The video was taken around 6 pm when the store's doors opened on Thursday.

Other videos have emerged showing the violence underway across the country's stores as determined shoppers battle for the best Black Friday bargains.

They come after reports of a thief shooting a man for his new TV in Las Vegas, one man stabbing another over a parking space in Virginia and cops shooting a would-be shoplifter in Chicago.

One video posted to YouTube shows the chaos over DVD players, Garmin GPS systems and other items at a Walmart in Saginaw near Fort Worth, Texas.

Police in one Walmart store were on hand to break up a fight between two woman over a flat-screen television

Customers knock down entire stands holding phones to get their hands on cheaper Blu-ray and DVD players as staff struggle to keep them under control. Eventually police officers arrive on the scene to break up the chaos.

Much of the violence is apparently occuring at Walmarts, with Twitter useers even adopting a hashtag '#WalmartFights' to document the most outrageous spats.

'Walmart is like a war zone,' one Twitter user wrote. 'Fight to the death to get the s*** you want.'

Another added: 'I have never felt more shame for humanity than I do right now watching people in Walmart fight over a tv, Alabama bookbag & a $14 blender.'

One other disgruntled shopper, from McKinney, Texas, added: 'NEVER will I go to Walmart black Friday again I got stuck in the middle of a fight over a stupid tablet. if you wanna see crazy go there.'

But Walmart spokesperson Brooke Buchanan told The Huffington Post such incidents don't accurately depict the retailer's successful day.

'We've got great feedback from customers and associates across the country,' Buchanan said. 'A few tweets aren't representative of what's actually happening at 4,600 stores.'

Major incidents have also occurred outside shops, including a man shooting a shopper in the leg as he left a Target in Las Vegas with his new television.

The alleged shooter, who has not be caught, was then able to flee with the device.

Shots also rang out in Chicago, after a police officer chased an alleged shoplifted to a waiting car. The man trapped the officer's arm inside the car door and then proceeded to drag him along.

Only when another officer fired shots at the car - striking the driver in the arm - did the vehicle stop.

And in yet another brutal incident, two men argued over a parking space in Tazewell County, Virginia before one man used a knife to cut the other in the arm, slicing down to the bone.
