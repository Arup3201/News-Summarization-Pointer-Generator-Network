Working out the calories in a slice of cake or the fat in a portion of fries is now easier than ever thanks to Google's new nutritional search feature.

The launch will allow diet-conscious surfers to discover nutritional information including the fat, carbohydrate and salt content of over 1,000 foods in a click of a button.

A blog post by Google explained that it could be difficult to make sensible food choices and that the new tool will help us make better food choices: 'We’re hoping we can make those 
choices a little bit easier: starting today you will be able to quickly 
and easily find extensive nutrition information for over 1,000 fruits, 
vegetables, meats and meals in search.'

Thanks to Google's new feature, surfers will be able to find clear and detailed nutritional information about over 1,000 foods by typing in keywords

Food for thought: The feature will provide comprehensive information about a specific food and even tell you if you are close to getting your recommended daily allowance of a particular nutrient

'From the basics of potatoes and carrots to more complex dishes like burritos and chow mein, you can simply ask, “How much protein is in a banana?” or “How many calories are in an avocado?” and get your answer right away.'

'You'll hear the answer to your specific 
question, see relevant nutrition information under an expansion, and be 
able to switch to other related foods or serving sizes.'

The blog post goes on to explain that the new nutritional information 
builds on work on the Knowledge Graph.

The graph uses Google's search results along with information from a wide range of websites to give searchers detailed and specific information about a particular topic, all in one place.

As part of the nutritional information roll out, the graph helps connect related subjects, even in cases when those foods have a completely 
different sounding name from what you asked.

By typing or even talking into a microphone on your laptop or mobile phone, a person can look up hundreds of different foods. The feature is being rolled out across the U.S. over the next ten days

For
 example, if you ask about nutritional information concerning 'summer squash carbs', Google will include 'zucchini' 
as a relevant food in the dropdown, because it is a type of summer 
squash.

The blog post added: 'Over time we’ll be adding more features, foods, and languages.

You can even find out the nutritional information of food before and after they are cooked, such here when corn is fresh as well as when it has been popped. It is not clear when the feature will be available in the UK

'So tap the microphone, give the feature a spin, and soon explore and discover the ins and outs of over 1,000 of your favorite foods.'

The feature is being rolled out across the U.S. over the next ten days. It is not clear when Google will launch the feature in the UK.
