Found: Elisha Duncan, a NYPD officer reported missing, was found on Friday safe in the Bronx

A New York City cop who was reported missing was found safe in the Bronx on Friday.

Elisha Duncan, 46, a 14-year veteran on the force, had not been seen since Wednesday, when he was spotted at Empire Casino in Yonkers, New York, after collecting $40,000 from fellow officers for tickets for this weekend's New York Giants game against the Seattle Seahawks.

It is unknown if Duncan still has that money, or if he ever purchased tickets to the game. 

'We just found him, we haven’t interrogated him yet,' a police source told the Daily News.

Authorities believe that Duncan, who they say is depressed, may have gone on a gambling tear with the cash.

They also turned up angry voicemails and texts from fellow officers who had paid Duncan money for tickets to this Sunday's game, which is in Seattle, wanting to know what was going on.

Making the story even stranger is the fact that after he left the casino on Wednesday, Duncan then went and borrowed $1,000 from his sister to pay a bill.

A source says that Duncan had not touched his latest paycheck, and that his ATM card was not used on Thursday or Friday.

His father told the New York Post that he believes his son went into hiding because he did not have the money to give back to the men when he failed to produce the tickets.

It is these men wondering what was happening with their tickets who reported Duncan missing.

Game day: Duncan had taken the money promising he could get the men tickets to a football game

'Yesterday was a deadline for him to return the money to them and he did not have it. I believe that’s what caused the problem right now,” his father, Elisha Duncan Sr., said.

'He was depressed.”

He believes his son is depressed and needs help.

His father believes he was unable to get the tickets and possibly gambled the money away, and was depressed and afraid to face the officers
