Elaine Lordan, a former EastEnders soap star, has been seen drinking from a bottle of white wine in the street.

The troubled actress  took her dog walking in North London in late November, but was later the same day pictured purchasing alcohol and drinking it while she walked home.

Elaine, 47, who has battled alcoholism in the past, endured a tragic course of events when her mother, father and son died in close succession, shortly after she was treated for the problem.

The star had been pictured picking up a bottle of Chenin Blanc at a corner shop, which she walked out carrying inside a black plastic bag.

Making strides in a pair of comfortable trainers, she didn't go far before opening the alcohol and proceeding to take a swig in public.

Elaine then appeared to stop in one spot, upturn the bottle and finish the capacity of the drink in one go. The actress went to dump the bottle in a bin before even making it home with her purchase.

The star once played Lynne Slater in the high profile BBC soap and she looked a little tired. 

Her gaunt frame showed through a layered up ensemble. 

Hiding beneath a velvet tracksuit, green parka and  cap, the former 'Ender was barely recognisable.

Before: In 2003, the recognisable EastEnders actress was convicted of drink-driving and had her licence revoked

Elaine started her day by walking her dog. 

She looked happy despite her troubles and had a smile to show when she held the pooch close in North London.  

Later that afternoon, Elaine took to the streets to clear the leaves with a kitchen mop that already looked dirty.

The soap star, who was once a member of the fictional Slater family, was thought to have sought professional help in 2003 for her drinking woes.

 In 2001, she received a driving ban for drink-driving and was ordered to pay £750 by magistrates in St Albans and ordered to pay £2,500 costs.

Breathalysers showed she had 51mg of alcohol in her breath. The legal limit is 35mg of alcohol per 100ml of breath.

She left the soap in 2004 - maintaining that she was not sacked for her excessive drinking - with the incentive to give up drink as she and partner Peter Manuel were trying for a baby.  

At the time, mum Bernadette told one magazine: 'Elaine drinks too much. It is a problem and I wish she would cut down.

'She will be seeing a professional for help. She was constantly in the public eye and working long hours. Drinking blocks out her stress.'

In 2005, Elaine's mother - who was helping her to rehabilitate - died after throwing herself in front of a London tube.

The 62-year-old left Lordan grief stricken and nine months later her baby was born five weeks premature.

When she miscarried with her second baby it was not long before her 72-year-old father Garrett died in 2008.
