He stands accused of a string of murders, but mob boss Thomas Gioeli's reputation could be put in jeopardy if the jury in his trial is shown a picture of him with the Sopranos cast, his lawyer claims.

Gioeli, 59, is on trial for organising six killings in the 1990s to rise to the top of the Colombo crime family, including an off-duty cop who was gunned down for marrying a former mafia wife.

The prosecution asked the judge yesterday to allow a photo of Gioeli posing with actors of the HBO mob series to be submitted as evidence.

But his lawyer, Adam Perlmutter, protested, claiming: 'To connect Mr Gioeli with 'The Sopranos' television show is extraordinarily prejudicial.'

'It's a television show about organised crime.' he said, reports the New York Post.

Judge Brian Cogan has yet to rule on whether or not the photo can be submitted.

Also known as ‘Tommy Shots’, Gioeli is on trial with Colombo soldier Dino Saracino, 39, aka ‘Little Dino’, who is accused of taking part in three of the six killings.

They are also accused of extortion, racketeering and other offences.

The two men are said to have been operating during the 1990s when the New York-based Colombo crime family descended into a civil war.

Former Bonnano underboss, turned informant, Salvatore Vitale, also known as 'Good Looking Sal' took the stand against the men yesterday where he painted a colourful picture of mob life and the internal chaos that blighted the Columbos.

He said the family's power struggle was so destructive that the four other crime families called an intervention and organised for the New York Mafia Commission to hold a secret sit down.

'Bodies are all over the street, and legitimate people are getting killed. We can't go on like this,' a Genovese mobster said at the meeting, according to Vitale reports the Post.

'When it's all over the news, all over the newspapers, it's bad for business.' Vitale said during his four hours on the stand, according to the New York Times.

Prosecutor Christina Posa said that Gioeli and Saracino stuck with the family boss and set about executing those deemed to be traitors with ‘horrific acts’ which they planned meticulously.

Targets would be trailed for days on end to assess their movements before they made their moves, the court heard.

Miss Posa said: ‘As professional killers, that was their specialty - committing murder and getting away with it - until today’.

William 'Wild Bill' Cutolo was lured into Saracino's apartment, where he was shot in the head from point blank range

Underboss William ‘Wild Bill’ Cutolo  was deemed to be a threat in 1999 because he was wealthy and influential, so Gioeli supposedly organised a kill squad including Saracino to get rid of him.

The court heard Cutolo was lured into Saracino’s apartment where he was shot in the head from point blank range.

The body was then wrapped in plastic and dumped in a remote location outside of New York where it was buried and covered in quicklime to help with the decomposition.

The remains were undiscovered for 10 years until the FBI went looking and noticed the tip of Cutolo’s Italian loafers poking out of the ground.

Vitale recalled the moment that he realised Cutolo was dead at a meeting held between the bosses of the Bonannos and Columbos in ana apartment in Brooklyn.

He said he knew something was wrong when he saw that the seat that should have been taken by Cutolo was empty, reports the Times.

When asked about the absences, another mobster boss from the family had said: 'You can't take in this life what's not yours,' Vitali recalled.

'I realized then that Wild Bill was dead,' he told the court.

The most well known killing was that of NYPD cop Ralph Dols in 1997, the court was told.

He was executed for marrying Kim Kennaugh who had previously wed three mobsters including consigliere Joel Cacace.

Cacace allegedly took offence at being ditched for a policeman and ordered the cop dead, so turned to Gioeli who ambushed him outside his home in Brooklyn, New York.

Gioeli is accused of supervising the hit squad in the killing of the officer as he and his wife and their baby daughter were outside their home in Gravesend, reports the Post.

Miss Posa said: ‘(Cacace) wanted Ralph Dols dead and he turned to that man to get it done’, pointing at Gioeli.

The other alleged murders were Frank ‘Chestnut’ Marasa in 1991 to avenge the death of a Colombo family member.

Gangsters John Minerva and Michael Imbergano were killed in 1992 because the former did not stand with the Colombo boss during the civil war.

Mobster Richard Greaves was executed in 1995 for trying to leave the family.

According to the New York Times, Gioeli’s lawyer Carl Herman dismissed the case and said that the FBI were ‘desperate’ having pursued him for two decades.

Saracino’s lawyer Samuel Braverman said there was no physical evidence tying him to the crimes and that the witnesses were unreliable.

He said: ‘I’m not here to tell you Dino is a choirboy. He isn’t.

‘I’m not here to tell you he didn’t commit the murders because he’s a nice guy. I’m telling you he didn’t commit the murders because he didn’t commit the murders.’

The trial at Brooklyn’s Federal Court continues.
