A toddler who suffered a fatal wound to the head was unlawfully killed, a coroner has concluded, despite no-one being charged over her death.

An inquest into the death of Summer Rogers-Ratcliffe, who was 21 months old when she died, heard she was subjected to a non-accidental 'blunt force trauma'.

Police arrested Summer’s mother Victoria Rogers, 27, stepfather Craig Sharp, 34, and grandmother Susan Rogers, 58, on suspicion of murder after her death because all three had cared for the toddler during the period when experts said she must have been hit.

Tragic: Summer Rogers-Ratcliffe was 21 months when she died of a blunt force head injury that caused her brain to bleed in February 2012. But two-and-a-half years later, no one has been charged with her death

Family: The court heard Summer, pictured with mother Victoria Rogers, came from a loving family who had no contact with social services. But a coroner has now ruled she was 'unlawfully killed'

The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) decided no-one could be prosecuted over her death because it could not be established whether it was her mother, stepfather or maternal grandmother who was looking after her at the time she was injured.

At the end of an inquest today, Assistant Deputy Coroner Oliver Longstaff said the non-accidental nature of the injury had been established not merely on the 'balance of probabilities', but also 'beyond reasonable doubt', as is necessary to secure a conviction in the criminal courts.

He said: 'In my view, and to the criminal standard of proof, I am satisfied that whatever the state of mind of the perpetrator of the act that caused Summer's ultimately fatal injury, it would have been obvious to that perpetrator that Summer was being subjected to forces far in excess of anything she might have been expected to withstand, and which were overwhelmingly likely to cause her very significant injury.

'I accordingly will record a conclusion that Summer was unlawfully killed.'

Detective Constable Richard Peckett had told the inquest in Bradford that Summer's mother, Victoria Rogers, had been arrested on suspicion of murder during the investigation into her daughter's death, along with her grandmother Susan Rogers and her mother's partner Craig Sharp.

Confusion: Her stepfather Craig Sharpe (pictured with Summer) and her maternal grandmother were also arrested and then released because the CPS could not determine who had been looking after the 21-month-old

He said West Yorkshire Police submitted a file to the CPS but there was no prosecution.

The detective said this was because all three of those arrested had looked after Summer at her home in Dewsbury, West Yorkshire at some time in the early morning of February 27, 2012, but pathologists were unable to pin-point exactly when the injuries were sustained.

Mr Longstaff also concluded there was no evidence Summer had been subjected to regular neglect or abuse.

He said: 'The childcare arrangements that were in place for her meant that she was regularly cared for in three distinct family environments, in each of which it appears to me she was lovingly and appropriately looked after.

'The event that led to her death was, I find, an extraordinary and horrific one-off event that could not have been predicted.'

The court was told how Summer was a normal, healthy child in a family with no involvement with social services.
