In August 1978, 15-year-old Barbara Nantais was found strangled to death, mutilated with a knife and with a fistful of wet sand stuffed down her throat on a beach in San Diego.

Six years later, Claire Hough, age 14, was discovered murdered on the same stretch of beach and suffering roughly the same injuries to her body as Nantias.

Both murders languished in the cold-case file for more than 30 years until this month, when police used DNA evidence to link two men to Hough's killing.

Both suspects - convicted career criminal Ronald Clyde Tatro and retired police criminalist Kevin Charles Brown - have since passed away.

Tatro was killed in an apparent boating accident in 2011, and Brown committed suicide last week by hanging himself in Cuyamaca State Park.

But police said they have not found any evidence to link either man to Barbara Nantais' killing, which remains unsolved.

The 15-year-old was found naked, beaten and strangled near lifeguard tower No. 7 at Torrey Pines State Beach on the morning of August 13, 1978.

One of her nipples was cut open and sand was crammed into her mouth.

Nantais and her 17-year-old boyfriend, both from Long Beach, were camping on the beach when they were attacked.

Jim Alt, now 54 years old, has said he was knocked unconscious with a rock and a log from a firepit while he and his girlfriend were sleeping in their zipped up bags.

Grisly crime: One of her nipples was cut open and sand was crammed into her mouth

Alt has never been considered a suspect in the case. He was found near Barbara's body with a serious head wound that left him slipping in and out of consciousness.

Passers-by discovered Nantais' mutilated body lying on the sand. Naked and spread-eagled, the killer had cut into the circumference of her nipple with a knife, according to the autopsy report.

Six years later, Claire Hough, from Rhode Island, was visiting her grandparents in Del Mar Heights when she turned up dead on Torrey Pines State Beach on the morning of August 23, 1984.

Lead: Retired San Diego criminologist Kevin Charles Brown, 62, had been questioned over Hough's killing and was facing an arrest when he killed himself 

The teenager was discovered by a local resident lying on a white towel, her left breast sheared off with a knife, and her body and face bruised and cut. A pair of jeans she had on were torn open and pulled down.

Autopsy reports showed that both Hough and Nantais suffered injuries consistent with sexual assault, but no semen was found on their bodies, reported U-T San Diego.

The striking similarities between the two cases have been gnawing at investigators and the girls' families for decades until in 1995 the FBI confirmed that both Barbara and Claire were likely killed by the same person.

But Claire Hough's parents had their own suspect in mind.

Samuel and Penelope Hough's suspicions fell on Wallace Howard Wheeler, the man who found the 14-year-old's mutilated body on the beach and called police.

Before the Houghs had a chance to seek him out, Wheeler approached them himself, rambling about his supposed psychic abilities and claiming he had seen in a vision that an angelic girl would be killed by two men.

Every week for more than a month after their encounter, Wheeler peppered the Houghs with 'bizarre' letters.

The girl's parents raised the alarm about Wheeler, but police quickly determined that he had nothing to do with Claire's slaying.

In 1988, four years after the murder, Wheeler committed suicide by jumping from the balcony of his 13th-floor apartment. His daughter said he had mental problems and had not been taking his medication, according to the newspaper. 

A break in Claire Hough's murder came last week when DNA evidence linked retired criminalist Kevin Charles Brown, 62, to the cold case. As police were preparing to arrest Brown, he was found dead.

Brown had been interviewed in connection with the crime before his apparent suicide, UT San Diego reported.

Crime scene investigator: Brown was a criminalist with San Diego police for 20 years. He is pictured here at a crime scene in 1991. He retired in 2002

San Diego police, which employed Brown between 1982 and 2002, have said he never had anything to do with investigating Claire's case.

Other suspect: Ronald Tatro was also linked to the murder. He died in 2011

A second suspect in the case, convicted criminal Ronald Tatro, died in Tennesse in a boating accident three years ago. 

Brown's widow has vehemently denied that he had anything to do with Claire's murder and suggested that his DNA could have become mixed with the evidence sample because he worked in the same lab. 

He had been questioned several times over the death, Channel 10 News reported, and preparations were being made to take him into custody.

Rebecca Brown said: 'The police have hounded my husband all year, and he ended up having a nervous breakdown and killed himself.

'They kept hounding him on something he didn’t do. He’s a good, kind, sweet, gentle man.'

The police department has dismissed the notion that accidental contamination could be the reason for Brown's DNA being present. 

As for Barbara Nantais' murder, both Tatro and Brown had alibis.

In August 1978, Tatro was was serving time in prison for kidnapping and raping a young woman in Arkansas. He had been sentenced to 40 years, but for an unexplained reason was released after only eight years. 

Brown's lawyer said that the criminologist was working in New Mexico at the time of the teenager's killing in San Diego.
