Perhaps it's the threat of Santa's naughty list but a survey has revealed that the day of the year Americans are least likely to watch pornography is Christmas.

Website Pornhub - which allows free access to millions of X-rated videos - analyzed their U.S. traffic in 2012 last week to work out when they had the highest and lowest number of viewers.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, the days when porn was least watched are all holidays - with the top three being Christmas Day, Thanksgiving and Easter Sunday.

Turned off: A porn website has revealed that it got the lowest number of hits on U.S. holidays

Americans are least likely to indulge in their X-rated habits on December 25 - perhaps due to the distraction of too much family, too much food and too many presents.

Similarly Thanksgiving on November 22 - the day to be thankful doesn't appear to stretch to indulging in porn.

It looks like some porn fans' religious obligations also get the better of them in early April as visits to Pornhub take a dip on Easter Sunday (April 8).

One-track mind: Perhaps unsurprisingly online porn viewers dropped in number on Valentine's Day... but there were still more people logging in than on other holidays (posed by models)

Christmas Eve hits the list at number four, when it's likely that last-minute gift-buying and turkey-basting takes precedence.

1. Christmas Day (December 25)

2. Thanksgiving (November 22)

3. Easter Sunday (April 8)

4. Christmas Eve (December 24)

5. Independence Day (July 4)

6. New Year's Day

7. Superstorm Sandy (October 20)

8 & 9 Memorial Day weekend (May 26 & 27)

10. Father's Day (June 17)

11. Valentine's Day (February 14)

At number five is Independence Day, when Americans are presumably too busy celebrating their Fourth of July freedom to bother with online antics.

New Year's Day makes an appearance next - suggesting a link between those who like to party to excess (and pay the consequences with a January 1 hangover) and have a predilection for online porn.

Next on the list this year was October 20 - the day when Hurricane Sandy struck the East Coast and Americans had more far important things on their minds (while several million Internet connections were also down).

Both days of Memorial Day weekend saw a dip in those watching porn followed by Father's Day.

Unsurprisingly, Valentine's Day sees porn viewing at an annual low - with the promise of real-life sex still preferable to that in cyberspace - however it does come bottom of the list.

Father's Day, Memorial weekend and Fourth of July also made the list of days when porn users were least likely to go online
