Missing: Peter Jackson set off for work more than a week ago but has not been seen since

Police investigating the mystery disappearance of a father-of-two have found his car.

Peter Jackson, who is a golf professional, set off for work more than a week ago but he never arrived. He has not been seen since.

The 38-year-old, of Seaham, County Durham, left his home at 8.20am on Monday, November 11, for the Castle Eden Golf Club in Hartlepool before vanishing.

His friends and family have described his disappearance as extremely out of character.

His car, a grey Ford Focus C Max, has now been recovered close to Haltwhistle, in Northumberland, 55 miles from his home, and Northumbria Police are searching the area.

Peter's wife Alexis said: 'If anyone knows where Peter is please get in touch with the police urgently. 

'I cannot describe what our family have been going through since Peter went missing last Monday and we just need to know where Peter is. 

'I would also like to appeal directly to Peter to get in touch with us, we are all so worried and just need to know that you are safe.

'He loves his boys so much and they are missing his desperately they want to know where their daddy is and its devastating not to be able to give them an answer.

'We are just a normal loving family and cannot believe this is happening to us.

'Peter, I love you, the boys love you, your family and friends are desperately worried about you.
