Police in Italy have arrested a former Olympic sailing champion after breaking up an alleged child kidnapping ring.

Larisa Moskalenko, 50, who won bronze in the 1988 Olympics in Seoul, is one of several special forces veterans arrested according to reports.

It is claimed the ring took children by boat from North Africa to Europe through Sicily, where Ms Moskalenko ran a rent-a-boat firm.

The firm's website describes the former 
champion as 'born from a great passion for the sea' and notes among her 
achievements a gold medal at the World Championships in Long Beach, U.S.

Police in the town of Palermo, Sicily, have released a statement and photos of four suspects.

Police were first alerted to a gang when a child was kidnapped from Tunisia in October 2012 and brought to Norway, the Italian website Il Sito Di Palermo reported.

The website claimed the children involved were under the age of five.

The gang allegedly charged tens of 
thousands of dollars for the abductions, in which they used high-speed 
boats to traffic children whose parents were going through divorce 
proceedings.

The alleged plot involved kidnapping children from North African countries and taking them via Sicily to the rest of Europe. One child was allegedly taken to Norway in October last year

A second operation in November 2012 was 
reportedly foiled when police monitored the calls of Ms Moskalenko's 
firm, the BBC reported.

Three others arrested have been named as Luigi Cannistraro, Antonio Barazza and Sebastiano Calabrese.

Two
 Norwegians and a Swede are also being held in Tunisia. They have been 
named as Elisabeth Wenche Adresen, Martin Vage and Per Ake Helgesson.

Police claim further operations had been planned in Cyprus, Lebanon and Egypt.
