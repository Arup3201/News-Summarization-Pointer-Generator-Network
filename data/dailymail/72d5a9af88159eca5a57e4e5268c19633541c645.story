Family and friends are almost certain that the discovery of human remains, made about a week ago, are of Australian hiker Matt Allpress.

The 23-year-old Perth man had been reported missing in Nepal's Annapurna region after he failed to board his flight to Sydney on November 14 following a solo 10-day trek.

A Facebook page set up by Mr Allpress' family and friends said on Friday that his parents had gone to the Pokhara police station in Nepal on Wednesday, where they confirmed that the clothing and personal items found with some human remains belonged to their son.

On Thursday, Margaret and Mark Allpress took the remains of what the family believes 'is almost certainly Matthew' to a Kathmandu hospital for official identification.

They also hope the cause of his death will be determined.

Part of the remains, along with samples of his parents' DNA, will be sent to Melbourne for additional testing.

Nepal police are planning to do further searches in the area where he was found to try and locate his backpack which is currently unaccounted for.

Mr Allpress was reported missing six months ago after failing to return from a solo 10-day hiking trek in Nepal

MailOnline reported earlier in the week that human remains were located on Saturday by two local Nepalese people foraging in the mountains above Sikles, about one hour off the main track.

Police located several personal items belonging to Mr Allpress including his ATM card, 120 Nepalese rupees, a jacket, pocket diary and iPhone.

Until recently, Mr Allpress' friends and family remained optimistic of finding him alive, creating a social media campaign to help locate him.

Almost $10,000 was raised in December to help continue to fund the aerial and land search.

Family and friends updated follower on Friday via the Facebook page 'Find Matt'

The search has been focused on Nepal's Annapurna region where Mr Allpress was trekking
