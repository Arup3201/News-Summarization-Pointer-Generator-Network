Troubled singer George Michael has spent several days in hospital after falling ill suddenly, it emerged today.

Two ambulances were sent to the 50-year-old's north London mansion after the star fell ill and a worried friend made a 999 call last Thursday.

Michael - whose real name is Georgios Kyriacos Panayiotou - nearly died from pneumonia in late 2011.

His spokesman said today: 'In response to
 newspaper reports today, we can confirm George was admitted to hospital
 on May 22. He was discharged last weekend and is well and resting. He 
is very much looking forward to the release of his new single in July.

London Ambulance Service confirmed two ambulances were called at 8am on Thursday.

‘We
 were called just before 8am on May 22. We sent two ambulance crews and 
staff treated one patient, a man, who was then taken to hospital,’ a 
spokesman for the ambulance service said.

George Michael's co-writer and 'best mate' David Austin earlier arrived at the star's Hampstead home and scotched rumours the singer was ill.

Austin, born David Mortimer, was a member of George Michael's first band 'The Executives' in 1981. He has also written and performed with his friend.

He told reporters that his friend was 'perfectly fine' and had just finished recording a new demo tape.

A neighbour who did not wish to be named added: 'He's getting better.'

Fans have already taken to Twitter to voice their concerns for the pop icon.

One user wrote: 'What's happened to my beloved @GeorgeMichael? reports coming in say he's been rushed to hospital :-( (sic)'.

Another hoped 'nothing serious' had happened to Michael.

Fears for the Careless Whisper singer's health have been raised in recent years due to a spate of illnesses, his regular cannabis use and due to a bizarre incident where he apparently fell out of a moving car on the M1 last year.

The incident, which took place in May 2013, saw Michael airlifted to trauma hospital to treat a head injury.

Just 18 months earlier the troubled singer had been close to death after being struck down with pneumonia in Vienna, but he fought back to perform again.

Michael, whose hits also include Faith and Freedom, has had health scares and run-ins with the police linked to his drug use.

In September 2010 Michael received an eight-week prison sentence following an incident the previous July in which he crashed his Range Rover into a shop in north London.

He was also given a five-year driving ban after he pleaded guilty to driving under the influence of drugs and possessing cannabis.

And he had earlier been banned from driving for two years and sentenced to 100 hours of community service in 2006 when he was convicted of driving while unfit through drugs after he was found collapsed in his Mercedes.

Following his brush with pneumonia in late 2011, Michael made a tearful appearance outside his London home after flying back into the country and said it had been "touch and go" whether he lived.Doctors had performed a tracheotomy to keep his airways open and he was unconscious for some of his spell in hospital.

MailOnline have contacted Michael's representatives for comment.

George Michael's incredible success as a musician has also come with great drama in his private life.

His latest collapse is one of several health scares in recent years, including his admission he was addicted to drugs.

The singer, whose real name is Georgios Panayiotou, hit rock bottom in 2010, right, when he was sent to Pentonville Prison in north London, where former inmates have included Oscar Wilde and Boy George, for driving while stoned and crashing into a Snappy Snaps shop. The judge jailed him because he was a 'danger to the public.

Most recently he nearly died after falling from a Range Rover at 70mph on the M1.

Here are some of the major incidents over the past 16 years:
