Coastguards today called off a £10,000 search for two boys who were thought to have gone missing from a popular tourist beach.

A three-hour search for the youngsters, aged six and eight, who were reported missing after they were last seen on the seafront at Ryde on the Isle of Wight this lunchtime, was later stood down.

The Marine and Coastguard Agency said on Twitter at 4.25pm: ‘We've searched the sea and shore and we now don't think there are two kids in danger.’

Search: The boys, aged six and eight, were said to have been wearing pale blue and red trunks respectively and it was reported that they had last been seen by Appley Tower in Ryde on the Isle of Wight

A Coastguard rescue team, helicopter 
and lifeboat were all involved in the search. Hampshire Constabulary 
said it was triggered when the force was alerted at 1.21pm by Solent 
Coastguard.

The boys were 
apparently last seen near Appley Tower. The six-year-old boy was said 
to have dark brown hair, pale skin, dark brown eyes and the 
eight-year-old had a mole on his left shoulder.

A
MCA spokesman said: ‘It is an area we can search very well with clear 
visibility. We are confident there is no child out there in difficulty.

‘Either
it was a hoax or a false report. The parents left the scene after 
making the report. Did they find the children and then leave without 
telling anyone?’

Response: The MCA had advised anyone who saw the missing children in the Ryde area to call 999

Mother-of-two Sarah Thornton, 38, said the search sparked a ‘huge
panic’ on the beach. The school governor from Lincoln, Lincolnshire, even
joined the vast search of the beach.

She said: ‘When we were told about the missing children it was
awful. You always assume the worst and being a mother, I felt sick. We all
joined the search, even my sons Harry, four, and George, six, came looking in
the nearby bushes.’

A Hampshire
and Isle of Wight police spokesman said the search was called off after
the parents failed to keep in touch and officers were unable to find an
address given by the family.

He
said: ‘We were called at 1.21pm today by HM Coastguard to assist with 
the search for two boys reported missing on the sea front at Ryde on the
Isle of Wight.

‘A man and 
woman said they had last seen the two boys at around 12pm today going 
into the water between the Ryde Inshore Rescue building and Appley 
Tower.

Ground support: A helicopter, lifeboat and coastguard rescue team were all involved in the search

‘A description of the
two boys was issued by HM Coastguard: a six-year-old boy with dark 
brown hair, pale skin, dark brown eyes, wearing pale blue trunks; and an
eight-year-old boy with a mole on his left shoulder, wearing red 
trunks.

Sarah Thornton, beachgoer

‘Police deployed 
officers and staff to check nearby public places, tourist attractions 
and hotels. Details of the boys were circulated to public transport 
operators and Solent ferry companies.

‘An
address given for the family on the Isle of Wight was checked by 
officers. The details provided were found to be incorrect. 
House-to-house inquiries were also carried out.

‘HM
Coastguard stood down its search of the sea and shore at around 4.15pm 
today as there was no further information to suggest two children were 
in danger.

‘Hampshire 
Constabulary would like to join coastguards in expressing thanks to 
everyone who helped with the search this afternoon.‘

'There could be a completely innocent explanation for what happened'

Hampshire Constabulary spokesman

'The
force is keeping an open mind about the circumstances of this report. 
There is no evidence at this time to confirm a criminal offence has been
committed deliberately.

‘There
could be a completely innocent explanation for what happened. Nothing 
can be ruled out as we assess all the information available.

‘We are renewing an appeal for the parents or any relatives of these two boys to contact the police.’
