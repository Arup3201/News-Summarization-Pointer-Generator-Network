Brendan Rodgers is unlikely to be given money to spend to boost his Liverpool squad in January - putting paid to his hopes of signing Fabian Delph.

Liverpool remain in the mix for the Villa midfielder, with Tottenham also in the frame, but any deal will be a free transfer in the summer.

Rodgers still wants a new goalkeeper and a striker to turn his side's dismal season around, but is most likely to dip into the loan market.

Without a January transfer budget Liverpool may have to put a move for Aston Villa's Fabian Delph on hold

Interest in Delph has become more intense following Emre Can's disappointing start to his Liverpool career

However, if the Reds' results continue to falter, plans for a January recruitment drive could change.

The Anfield boss wants to offload out-of-favour striker Fabio Borini, with Sunderland still keen, but the Liverpool hierarchy want Â£10million for the Italian.

Any move for Delph would mean the former Leeds star weighing up whether he would see first-team action.

Summer signing Emre Can was bought to be Liverpool's new holding midfielder but has so far failed to impress.

Seven days after their 3-0 loss to rivals Manchester United, Liverpool face Arsenal on Sunday as Rodgers looks to improve on a string of disappointing results.

The Reds have won just two of the last 14 Premier League meetings with Arsenal, but three points against the Gunners will help them in their quest to return to the top half of the Premier League.
