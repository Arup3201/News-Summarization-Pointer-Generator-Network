'He knows Manny's a great fighter but it's more about what he does outside the ring. He's such a charitable person.'

Rasheda added that her father acknowledges Mayweather's own boxing capabilities but admitted they are two very different personalities. 

'My dad stood for things. Mayweather... I don't think there's a comparison,' she said, before revealing that Ali will not be in attendance for the fight in Las Vegas on May 2 but will watch it on television.

'There's no question he's going to order it,' Rasheda said. 'It takes my dad way back to when he was fighting.'
