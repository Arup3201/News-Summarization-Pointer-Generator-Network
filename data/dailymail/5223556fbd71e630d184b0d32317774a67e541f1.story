Jamie Lee Curtis is home resting after being hospitalised following a car crash.

The Los Angeles Police department has confirmed that Curtis was involved in a collision at 10:10 a.m. on Thursday at the intersection of Pacific Avenue and Rose Avenue in Venice Beach, California.

According to a witness the 54-year-old 
called her friend Jodie Foster moments after the incident and the Oscar-winner 
showed up within minutes to lend some aid.

Curtis was riding in a black Yukon SUV limo when it was struck by a BMW, but the collision has officially been deemed an accident by police.

The star is said to have complained of ‘pain’ at the scene of the incident and was promptly rushed to a local hospital.

‘Jamie was indeed a passenger in a car involved in a collision this a.m.,’ the actress's rep explained to E! News on Thursday, ‘She went to the hospital to be checked out, but she is fine and is home resting.’

In photographs taken at the scene, Jamie looked shaken up as she spoke to a police officer who had attended the scene.

Debris littered the road, and Jamie chatted with Jodie about what had just happened.

Firefighters also attended, and were pictured delivering first aid at the scene.

An ambulance then took Jamie to the ER, but according to TMZ her injuries were minor and she is now back home recovering.

Another person was also taken to hospital, and their injures were more serious.

While the pair have yet to appear in the same film together, they both starred in versions of Disney's Freaky Friday.

Jodie
was nominated for a Golden Globe for her turn as daughter Annabel 
Andrews in the 1976 hit original, which tells the story of a mother and 
daughter switch bodies and get a taste of the other's life.

Jamie played the mother opposite Lindsay Lohan in the 2003 remake, though her name in this film was changed to Tess Coleman.
