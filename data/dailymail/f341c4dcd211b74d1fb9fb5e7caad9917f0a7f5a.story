An interactive map that plots life 
expectancy and child poverty by London Underground station has revealed the stark inequalities that exist in the UK's capital city.

Children who live in the salubrious surroundings of Knightsbridge can expect to live to an impressive 90-years of age, yet their peers who reside just a few stops down the Piccadilly line in Hammersmith can only expect to reach 79.

The largest contrast is between Oxford Circus, where youngsters are predicted to live to 96.38, and Star Lane on the Docklands Light Railway, where the life-expectancy is 75.3 years.

The map was designed by James Cheshire and Oliver O'Brien from the Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis at the University College London. The pair hoped to reveal how widely children's outlooks differ even though they live just minutes from eachother in the same city. The map covers zones 1, 2 and most of zone 3.

Writing on hisÂ Spatial Analysis Blog, James Cheshire, said: 'It was my intention to create a memorable impression of the persistent inequalities along (and between) the routes travelled by millions of Londoners each day.'

To create the map, the researchers drew circles with a 200m radius around each station and looked at existing life expectancy data from each city ward. If the circle covered more than one London ward an average was taken and all values were then rounded.

The map found startling disparities all over London. For instance life expectancy decreases by 12 years on the 20 minute ride on the Central Line between Lancaster Gate and Mile End. Meanwhile simply crossing the Thames from Pimlico in the north to Vauxhall in the south sees life expectancy drop by six years.
