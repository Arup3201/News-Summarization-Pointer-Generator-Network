Strictly Come Dancing star Fiona Fullerton is selling her £2.5million haunted mansion because she can't face living in an 'empty nest' with no children.

The British actress, 57, and her family have lived in the luxury Cotswolds mansion since she snapped it up for less than a million in the late 90s.

But one-time Bond girl Fiona and husband Neil Shackett are selling the Grade II-listed home because his son James, 23, has left home and their daughter Lucy, 17, is about to move on.

The Grade-II listed property comes with a two-and-a-half acre garden - complete with huge swimming pool

'It has been the most wonderful place to live. But it really needs children in it,' said Fiona.

The Grade-II listed property comes with a two-and-a-half acre garden - complete with huge swimming pool.

The homely kitchen has a beautiful cream Aga cooker, while the huge bedrooms boast stunning views down to the River Thames.

But the seven-bed home is too big for her and her businessman husband who are now busy doing up a Georgian villa in the well-to-do Montpellier area of Cheltenham.

But the new owners will have to be prepared to share their posh new home with a permanent guest, according to local legend.

During the late 14th century a medieval castle stood on the site of Fiona's stunning house. It was home to the Duke of Lancaster's daughter Maud, and it is claimed Maud was murdered and her spirit still haunts the site.

Fiona, who danced the American Smooth last night, said: 'It has been the most wonderful place to live for the past 14 years - but the time is right to go.'

The Strictly contestant is currently waltzing her way towards the final of the hit BBC1 show with professional dancer Anton du Beke, but she is best known for for her role as seductive spy Pola Ivanova in the 1985 Bond film A View To Kill.

And when it comes to real estate, she 
is no novice when it comes to the market with a portfolio of 12 
buy-to-let properties in London and Oxford.

Giles
Lawton of Savills, who is marketing the property, said: 'It's rare to 
find such a beautifully-presented old vicarage in this part of the 
country.

'It's very much a family home, with a beautiful kitchen at its heart. It's heaven for children.'

Situated on the banks of the Thames, with 350ft of river front on the border with Wiltshire, the home sits in two and a half acres of Cotswolds garden.

Fiona said: 'It was 1999. Neil and I were living in Weybridge, Surrey, at the time in the house that he had lived in with his first wife before she died.

'It had a lot of memories. The Old Vicarage was the fourth house we looked at. It was beautiful, but it needed some serious TLC - it had been neglected for 20 years.

'We both wanted a project. I had been
doing up buy-to-lets for years, and I know that the only way you make 
money from a house is if you improve it.'

Refurbishment took two years with the builders living on site for ten months.

Fiona said: 'Our daughter Lucy was only three at the time, but she became quite good friends with the builders. She would eat breakfast with them every day.

'We had to do a lot of work initially, including taking out the entire staircase. But once it was finished it was lovely. I wanted it to be a family home.

'The dining room is green, the snug is dark red. We used to have a playroom where the kids would have their toys out, and it was always covered in model railways.

'The gardens, which run down to the river Thames, were even more idyllic for children.

'There was a tennis court, and we added a swimming pool. We also have a little boat, so you can go out on the river. It’s all very Swallows and Amazons.'

Gloucestershire will still be home when she and Neil move to their new house in the smart Montpellier area of Cheltenham.

Fiona said: 'It was a wreck when we bought it earlier this year. It had been offices, so we’ve had to convert it back, but it’s a gorgeous Georgian villa, right in the middle of town.'
