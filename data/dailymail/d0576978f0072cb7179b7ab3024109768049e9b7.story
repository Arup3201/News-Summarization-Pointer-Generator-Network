The Sabbath crowd huddled by the McLaren garage for a picture of what they really wanted – Fernando Alonso pulling on to the track at Jerez.

Pre-season testing is for the hardy, wearing scarfs and fortified by hot flasks. But they were warmed at 10.42am local time on Sunday when the McLaren, powered by Honda, carried the local hero out for an installation lap.

Camera crews then captured the moment when Alonso returned his new machine to the garage. It's glitzy this testing lark.

McLaren expect only to be running sporadically over the next four days. Their Honda power unit is new, in the experimental phase. Teething problems would seem inevitable.

Alonso's team-mate Jenson Button landed in Jerez on Saturday, but will not be driving until Monday.

Ditto Lewis Hamilton of Mercedes. The German world champions unsurprisingly set the fastest time early on the first morning with Nico Rosberg at the wheel. 

His time was later eclipsed by Sebastian Vettel who set the fastest lap of the opening day in his Ferrari, but Rosberg managed an impressive 157 laps in his Mercedes.

He had earlier vowed 'maximum attack' in a new title battle with Formula One world champion team mate Lewis Hamilton on Sunday as Mercedes unveiled their 2015 car before pre-season testing started in Jerez.

'I know the feeling of winning and of fighting for a championship after last year, but I also know the feeling of not winning in the end and I don't want to repeat that,' said the German.

'It's an extra boost and it gives me so much motivation for the year ahead.'

Rosberg, son of Finland's 1982 champion Keke, won five races last year to Hamilton's 11 and finished runner-up in a dominant season for his team and one that saw the drivers' relationship tested to the limit.

Mercedes are again expected to set the pace, even if the cars have not changed dramatically since last year's debut of the new V6 turbo hybrid power units and rivals hope to have closed the gap.

'It will be massively tough to repeat what we achieved in 2014 but we all want to keep that momentum going and to dominate the sport for many years to come,' said Rosberg.

'We know the opposition will be right there, so we have to keep pushing flat out to have any chance of doing that. Nothing is for certain but, whatever happens, I know it will be another great battle with Lewis.

'This year is the rematch for me and I'm massively motivated for it.'

Hamilton, now a double world champion after taking his first title with McLaren in 2008, agreed that there could be no complacency.

The Briton said he was also fired up for the season which starts in Australia on March 15.

'You hear about people who achieve a lot but then lose their focus and you wonder; at what point does it fade off? I'm grateful that the fire is still there in me,' he said.

'I think subconsciously the taste of success spurs me on. I like that feeling and I want to feel it again and again,' added the 30-year-old.

'I'm glad me and Nico had the battle we did last year. I love winning races but it just feels so much better when you have to fight for it. I just want to get back out there, race hard, be the best I can be and hopefully win some more.'

German driver Sebastian Vettel, who will be the best paid driver in the history of the sport, was also in action for his new team Ferrari.

Vettel has arrived from Red Bull to replace Spaniard Alonso and he too took to the track for testing in Jerez.

'Obviously there is a change in colour for me so it's a new experience but I think the car looks beautiful,' said Vettel.

'There is a lot of change going on, a lot of new people in new positions including myself, and it always takes a bit of time to settle in.

'I'm confident that we are going in the right direction but I think it would be wrong to immediately expect a lot of us.

'We need to remember we are coming from a 2014 season where there was one team very dominant so it will be difficult to be right there from the beginning.'
