Ryan Taylor is sat having dinner with two of his team-mates and their partners. It is April of last year and they are at the historic Close House, resting on Hadrian’s Wall in Newcastle. It’s where he got married, plays golf and socialises. It’s a happy place.

Tonight, however, those special memories will be tainted by one phone call and the devastating news relayed to him.

Forty-eight hours earlier, Taylor, afforded protection as a ‘non-contact floater’ in a practice match at Newcastle’s training ground, tweaked his knee chasing a loose ball.

Only a matter of days into his comeback from eight months out with knee ligament damage, he convinced himself it was a minor setback.

Then the phone rang. It was Paul Catterson, the club doctor.

‘I was with Dan Gosling, James Perch and our wives and girlfriends,’ he recalls as we sit in the home dressing-room at St James’ Park, where he will on Saturday run out for the first time in more than two years against QPR.

‘The Doc phoned. I always used to know with his calls if it was good or bad. It was either very quiet, “Hello Ryan”. Or, “Alright Ryan, how you doing?”.

‘I knew straight away. It was the ACL (anterior cruciate ligament) again. I went back to the table, everyone was really upset. It hadn’t sunk in with me.’

Sink in, it later did, but only amid a flood of tears.

‘It wasn’t until I walked through the doors at training that I thought, “hold on a minute, I’m not coming to train here”,’ says Taylor, who on Friday unveiled a mural featuring 2,000 fans outside St James’ which was created and installed by sponsors wonga.com.

‘I completely broke down. There were a few shoulders which had tears on that day.’

Taylor has been recalling the devastating injury that kept the defender out of action for Newcastle

Taylor was told he could be 30 by the time he returned to football following his devastating injury

Taylor, then 28, was told he’d be 30 by the time he returned. He rang his dad, Darren, back at home in Liverpool.

‘We talked about it - I’d put so much in and got nothing from it. It just killed me, my body went in to shut-down mode,’ he says.

‘I said to my dad, “this could be me”. He said, “listen, it’s not happening”. It took a while to get my head around it all.’

The best surgeon in the world was identified – Dr Richard Steadman of Colorado. It emerged that Taylor’s initial knee operation, the previous year, had not gone to plan. 

He spent the next six months ‘doing absolutely nothing, it was torture’. Then, thanks to a donor – a male in his twenties who had died – his patellar tendon was replaced.

After that it was rehab. And then, more rehab. In October of this year, 26 months after his last appearance, finally, it was matchday. The opponents, Manchester City at the Etihad in the League Cup. Taylor takes up the story.

‘I thought I’d get half an hour but we had a team meeting and the XI went up. I was like, “hold on a minute, I’m in it”,’ he laughs.

‘I thought I’d play an hour. Once he’d made all three subs I thought, “what’s going on? It’s only 1-0, we could go to extra-time here”. So when Moussa (Sissoko) scored our second I wish that I could have sprinted and kissed him, but I couldn’t run.

‘It was one of those days where everything fell right and the result topped it off. It made those two years feel like two minutes.’

Afterwards, he received a standing ovation from his comrades.

‘It was incredible, the reaction from our fans and the lads,’ he says. ‘I had messages from John Terry, Steven Gerrard, Michael Owen, they helped me.’

Newcastle’s physio, Derek Wright, also gets a special mention – ‘he was like my dad up here’ – but his wife, Kim, and boys, Henri, three, and baby Evan, were Taylor’s biggest source of strength.

This Saturday afternoon, the club have allowed him to walk out with Henri.

‘He’s been there from day one,’ says Taylor. ‘He’s never seen me play here, he was only six months old when I did my knee.

‘It will be a special day and I’m lucky to have a brilliant relationship with these fans, scoring the winner against Sunderland helps of course.’

That goal, in a 1-0 win in 2011, is a happy memory. After two years of turmoil, Taylor wants more like them, starting with Saturday.
