Rapist: Marius Glad Trimbitas, 33, who was jailed for eight years for attacking a woman who was waiting for a bus home

A Romanian criminal who was deported eight years ago was able to come back to Britain and rape a woman at a bus stop.

Homeless Marius Glad Trimbitas, 33, was kicked out of the country in 2005 after an attack on a prostitute.

But he returned this year, and within six months carried out a horrific drug-fuelled assault on a woman waiting for a bus  after a night out.

The case raises worrying questions about border controls and how a convicted criminal was able to return to Britain.

Last night, police launched an appeal for any other potential victims to come forward, warning that they ‘cannot rule out he has done this before’.

Trimbitas was deported in 2005 following the conviction for false imprisonment of the prostitute, Woolwich Crown Court heard.

He was given a two-year conditional discharge – effectively a slap on the wrist.

But it is thought the nature of the offence, and the lack of proper punishment, meant his criminal record was not uploaded to border watch lists, allowing him to return in March this year.

Last month, he targeted his 24-year-old victim after she left the Ministry of Sound nightclub near Elephant and Castle in South London.

Sentencing him to eight years in jail, Judge Alice Robinson said the attack had a ‘devastating’ impact on the woman.

Evidence: A shoe Marius Glad Trimbitas abandoned at the scene after being fought off by passers by who heard his victim's screams. Forensic tests were carried out linking him to the sex attack

She was left with multiple injuries following the assault on October 6 and was saved only when three members of the public heard her cries and fought off the attacker.

Simon Shannon, prosecuting, said the victim was out with friends for a birthday celebration and left the nightclub to catch a bus home. She was walking along the New Kent Road at 4am.

‘Before she knew what had happened she had been grabbed from behind,’ Mr Shannon said.

Trimbitas dragged the victim into a stairwell, where he subjected her to a horrific assault while threatening to kill her.

The attack was ‘extremely painful’, and the victim struggled to breathe, Mr Shannon said. When she screamed, Trimbitas shoved his hand into her mouth.

It ended only when three passers-by intervened and one dragged Trimbitas off the woman.

Scene: The woman was attacked while waiting for a bus on New Kent Road, near Elephant and Castle, south London, last month

He was traced from a shoe left at the scene. Police launched a manhunt across South London to identify him and eventually he handed himself in.

Trimbitas admitted rape, sexual assault and making threats to kill.

Judge Robinson said: ‘You were here little more than six months before committing this horrific crime.’

She said he was ‘so drunk and/or high on drugs’ that he could not remember the attack.

‘You inflicted serious injuries on this victim, both physical and psychological,’ she said.

The court heard Trimbitas described his own actions as ‘beyond evil’. Labour politicians said that the case raised serious questions about border checks.

Shadow immigration minister David Hanson said: ‘This was a horrific and needless attack as the man in question should never have been allowed back into the country.

‘The Government should make clear what they are doing to ensure something like this can never happen again.’

Detective Inspector Jackie Wakeford-Smith said the attack was ‘horrendous’ and ‘beyond words’.

‘I cannot rule out that he has not done this before. If you have been assaulted by Trimbitas, please come forward and tell us.’

A Home Office spokesman said the rapist will be deported at the end of his sentence.

‘Anyone coming to the UK must abide by our laws and EU citizens who commit crimes are liable to be removed,’ he added.

‘Marius Trimbitas has been found guilty of an appalling attack and is rightly behind bars.’

The spokesman said the Government was ‘starting the deportation process earlier and removing foreign criminals quicker than ever’.

Since 2010, more than 17,000 offenders had been removed or deported, including 4,765 last year.

He added that the Home Office has ‘close operational links with European police forces’ who share intelligence. Romanian and Polish officers are also seconded to provide intelligence and information on overseas convictions.
