The man who caused the violent Macquarie Fields riots in Sydney in 2005 has been involved in another serious car crash involving three vehicles.

In the smash outside Leumeah High School, south-west Sydney, on Thursday, his brother and cousin suffered facial, leg and hip injuries and two women were also hospitalised.

'I'm just a piece of s***, ay. Go away,' Jesse Kelly told waiting media outside Liverpool Hospital.

Asked as he left hospital what happened, Mr Kelly bluntly said 'there was a car accident '.

A witness to Thursday's crash outside Leumeah High School told The Daily Telegraph she was dropping her son at school when she was injured in the three-car smash.

Joanne Madden said: 'We were just driving off and a car was coming down and he came onto the wrong side of the road.'

Mr Kelly, his brother and cousin are now under police guard at hospital.

He was only released from jail on bail last year, after pleading guilty to dangerous driving causing the deaths of his two passengers in 2005.

Unrest: Police made numerous arrests in Macquarie Fields in Sydney's south-west in 2005 during ongoing unrest sparked by the death of two local teenagers in a stolen car driven by Mr Kelly

Frightening: They were some of the worst riots in Sydney's history

He was sentenced to seven years and nine months for the time he hit a tree while driving a Holden Commodore, when in Macquarie Fields in Sydney's southwest.

The crash killed Matthew Robertson, 19, and a 17-year-old Dylan Raywood.

After the incident Mr Kelly ran away and hid in the bush for 12 nights as the suburb exploded into four nights of rioting between residents and police.
