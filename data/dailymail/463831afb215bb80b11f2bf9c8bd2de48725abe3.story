The hospital where Ebola victim Thomas Eric Duncan died strenuously defended his treatment on Thursday and said he was given the highest level of care 'regardless of nationality or ability to pay'.

The Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas was responding to claims from the 42-year-old Liberian's family that he was given substandard treatment because he was 'a poor black man'.

The hospital said Mr Duncan had been cared for by a team of over 50 doctors and nurses, 24 hours a day.

Good treatment: Texas Health Presbyterian said Thomas Eric Duncan, above, had the best available care after his family claimed he was discriminated against because he was a 'poor black man'

Discrimination: Josephus Weeks, pictured with Jesse Jackson, told MSNBC after his uncle passed away: 'He had a very deep accent coming from West Africa. I believe they [the hospital authorities] didn't believe he deserved the care that everyone else should get. And you don't treat people like that'

It said Mr Duncan was not given the experimental drug ZMapp because the manufacturer hasn't got any more stocks and he was not given a blood transfusion from an Ebola survivor because he was a different blood group.

Details of his care were released as Duncan's nephew launched a renewed attack on the Dallas hospital, claiming his uncle had received inferior treatment.

Josephus Weeks told MSNBC: 'He is a poor black man. He had a very deep accent coming from West Africa. I believe they [the hospital authorities] didn't believe he deserved the care that everyone else should get. And you don't treat people like that.'

However the Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital has highlighted their determined effort to treat Mr Duncan and offered sympathy to his family and friends.

It said: 'Mr. Duncan's physicians treated him with the most appropriate and available medical interventions, including the investigative antiviral drug Brincidofovir.

'After consulting with experts across the country, the CDC, and the FDA, the investigative drug was administered as soon as his physicians determined that his condition warranted it, and as soon as it could be obtained. Mr. Duncan was the first Ebola patient to receive this drug.

Recovered: Dr Kent Brantly (left) and hygienist missionary Nancy Writebol (right) were the first two Ebola infected people ever brought to the United States and both have made a full recovery after receiving the experimental drug ZMapp

'The drug ZMapp was not administered to Mr Duncan because it was not available. According to the CDC and the drug manufacturer, it has not been available since August 12, 2014.

'Mr. Duncan did not receive the same type of serum transfusion as the patient in Nebraska because his blood type was not compatible with the serum donors.

'A team of more than 50 people cared for him in a professional and compassionate manner. An entire 24-bed intensive care unit was secured and dedicated to Mr. Duncan's care. The treatment area remains sealed and is being aggressively decontaminated.'

The hospital also claimed Mr Duncan was appropriately dealt with when he first presented to the hospital feeling unwell with Ebola-like symptoms - and was sent home with antibiotics - two days before he was rushed to hospital and given the correct diagnosis.

It said: 'In addition, we'd like to correct some misconceptions that have been reported about Mr. Duncan’s first visit. Our care team provided Mr. Duncan with the same high level of attention and care that would be given any patient, regardless of nationality or ability to pay for care.

'In this case that included a four-hour evaluation and numerous tests. We have a long history of treating a multicultural community in this area.'

Coming to America: Duncan, seen here with a female relative shortly after landing at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, traveled to the US to marry his longtime love Louise Troh

Josephus Weeks, Mr Duncan’s nephew, has the backing of human rights activist Reverend Jesse Jackson. He maintains his uncle was discriminated against.

Five US citizens have been diagnosed with Ebola and three have recovered. Virus victims Kent Brantley and Nancy Writebol were treated with the experimental drug ZMapp. Dr Rick Sacra and NBC camera Ashoka Mukpo received transfusions of Dr Brantley’s blood.

Ashoka Mukpo, is being treated at the University of Nebraska’s Medical Centre and a World Health Organization doctor is being treated in Atlanta, Georgia.

Mr Weeks told MSNBC: 'We were being mistreated. We were again being stigmatized. We go in there we being like, you know, ostracized. But after Reverend Jackson stepped in and he cried out for help for us, then a lot of people started changing their mindset.'

Reverend Jackson has echoed Mr Weeks claims of discrimination.

Rev Jackson told MSNBC: 'There's a fact of anti-immigrant, anti-refugee, anti-black. It's very real in our country. All we really know is that there was one treatment for the Americans at Emory, one treatment for the American in Nebraska, one treatment for Eric in Dallas.

'We know that in those cases where there were symptoms they got immediate relief. He had the symptom, came to the hospital and was turned away.

'He came back and laid there for three days really on oxygen and drip in bed sleeping to death until we began to protest. And now they've begun to make moves to make amends. And that's a good thing. But it did take a cry out from the public.'

Rev Jackson has been outspoken about Mr Duncan's treatment. He said in a tweet this morning: 'Thomas Eric Duncan deserved early and better treatment. We should learn from this tragedy. May he rest in peace.'

However Pastor George Mason, of the Wilshire Baptist Church, where Mr Duncan’s fiance Louise Troh is among the congregation, says criticism of the hospital was a natural reaction to grief.

He told MailOnline: 'There needs to be an investigation in the hospital procedures. But claims that Mr Duncan was not treated properly because he did not have medical insurance, because he was an immigrant, because he was black – these are all expressions of frustration and anger.

Condemnation: Reverend Jesse Jackson, seen here with Duncan's mother, said: 'There's a fact of anti-immigrant, anti-refugee, anti-black. It's very real in our country'

Speaking out:  Louise Troh (left), Thomas Eric Duncan's  fiancée, issued a statement calling for a full review of Duncan's medical care

'This is part of the normal train of events of people grieving for a loved-one – the "what could have been, what should have been done" questions are normal.'

Louise Troh and other members of her family who had close contact with Mr Duncan remain in quarantine or have had their movements restricted as doctors monitor whether they contracted the potentially deadly virus.

The family are in deep mourning following Mr Duncan's death. But plans for a memorial service for him must wait until the quarantine is lifted, Pastor Mason has said.

The hospital also hailed Mr Duncan’s courageous struggle against the virus and said staff shared his family's heartache.

It said: ‘Yesterday morning at 7:51 a.m. CT, Mr. Thomas Eric Duncan died after a courageous battle with Ebola.

‘Mr. Duncan’s family has experienced a personal and profound loss, and we share their grief.

‘Ebola is an insidious disease that attacks the body in multiple ways. Last Saturday, Oct. 4, Mr. Duncan’s condition changed from serious to critical and remained critical, as reported in our daily patient updates.

‘Wednesday morning, Oct. 8, his condition deteriorated.

‘In spite of the intensive care he was receiving, his heart stopped.

‘Early in his hospital stay, Mr. Duncan had expressed his wishes to his attending physician that the care team should not perform chest compressions, defibrillation or cardioversion to prolong his life.’

Scare: Sgt Michael Monnig, who visited the apartment where Mr Duncan was staying, was taken to hospital yesterday feeling unwell. Health officials said on Thursday that he does not have Ebola, despite his scare

Mr Duncan arrived in Texas on September 20 after allegedly lying on a form stating he had not come into contact with anyone with Ebola when he boarded a plane Liberia. He began showing symptoms of Ebola three days after his arrival and was admitted to Texas Presbyterian Hospital on September 28.

Meanwhile, a Sheriff’s deputy who feared he had become infected with Ebola during a visit to the Dallas apartment where Mr Duncan was staying has been given the all clear.
