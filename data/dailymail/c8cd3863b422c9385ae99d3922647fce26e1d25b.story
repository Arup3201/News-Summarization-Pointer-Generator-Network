A woman missing for four days and feared murdered after her family received a sinister text message claiming she was dead has been found alive 1,577 miles away, it emerged on Friday.

Rajwinder Kaur, of Queens, New York, never returned home after leaving to do volunteer work on Sunday evening. 

Later that night, her sister received a text message with the words: 'The girl with this phone is dead, was smiling'.

But Kaur was tracked down by police 1,577 miles away in Dallas, Texas, yesterday, when a friend who had bought her bus ticket tipped them off, MSNBC reported.

Mystery: Rajwinder Kaur, of Queens, New York, left her 198th Street, Hollis home on Sunday to go and do volunteer work at a homeless centre in Brooklyn at around 8pm and never returned

It was revealed that she had sent the chilling message and it also emerged that she had sold most of her possessions on eBay shortly before her disappearance.

It hasn't yet been established what she was doing in
Texas, or what drove her to send the harrowing text, which led to her offering a $5,000 reward for information of her 
whereabouts.

'There are no words to express our 
sincere gratitude to the NYPD, family, friends and everyone that 
assisted with this search,' Kaur's family said in a statement Thursday.

'The alarming text message was our biggest concern and we are just relieved that she is alive and well.'

Kaur's distraught family received the morbid text message less than two hours after she disappeared.

She had left home on Sunday to go and do volunteer work at a homeless centre in 
Brooklyn at around 8pm but never returned.

Later
that evening Kaur's sister, Gurpreet, received the text message from the 
26-year-old's phone.

Harrowing: Not long after Kaur left the home her sister received this text message

At first the family hoped the text was a joke but as when she failed to reply or return home, they began to fear the worst.

'It's too disturbing,' Gurpreet told NBC4, earlier this week. She added: 'I was reading it and it didn’t make sense and I worried, what’s going on?'

Kaur's brother-in-law Kulwinder Bhinder told the station: 'We are very nervous, we are scared. I know Raji. She will never send a message like that.

'There may be some bad, cracked person she faced that night, and that’s the scary part.

Police said Kaur's phone was tracked to Brooklyn that night where it was then shut off.

Investigating officers feared she may have joined a cult, speculating that the text message could be interpreted to mean 'the old Rajwinder is dead to you, the new Rajwinda is with us'.

But the family disregarded the idea. They said Kaur became more spiritual following a trip to India last winter but that she would not have joined a religious sect.

The New York Daily News reported that she may have run away to escape an arranged marriage but this too was denied by the family.

Kaur reportedly sold many of her family possessions on eBay shortly before she went missing. But the family said it would be out of character for the former social worker to disappear suddenly.

As they waited for news family members posted flyers around their Hollis, Queens neighbourhood and in Brooklyn in areas near where she worked, taking to Twitter and Facebook to try to get the word out.
