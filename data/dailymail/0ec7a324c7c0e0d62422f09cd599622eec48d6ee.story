A baby boy has been left with livid scratches on his head after a vulture attacked him during a bird display at a safari park.

The huge bird of prey attacked Cruz Conway, who is just six months old, as he was lying in his pram during the show at Knowsley Safari Park in Merseyside.

His parents Phil and Sherina had taken Cruz and his older brother Zak, four, on a day out to the park.

Cruz, who had hospital treatment after the incident, is now recovered at home, but his brother has nightmares

Mrs Conway, 34, who is a nurse, said: ‘He was lucky he wasn’t blinded.’

Mr Conway, 35, recalled the moment the American black vulture swooped down to land on the pram and began scratching at his son, and said that he had felt nervous earlier in the display.

‘There were two vultures and a smaller bird – I think some kind of crow – and when we went into the show they warned us not to get any food out as the vultures were going to be flying quite close.

‘They started flying around, but they were getting really close to the spectators’ heads. It made me really nervous.

‘The vulture flew over our heads, and Sherina ducked down, but then I didn’t see it take off.

‘When I turned around, it was on Cruz’s head scraping him. Its claws were all over his head and he was crying hysterically.

‘I panicked and had to strike the bird to get it away.’

He added: ‘I was really concerned because staff had just been saying how the vultures often pick up fox carcasses. Cruz only weighs less than 20lbs, so it’s a good job he was strapped in. It could have easily picked him up.’

The vulture did not draw blood but left Cruz with many scratches on his head. He was given first aid at the safari park and his parents decided to take him to be checked at hospital.

Staff at the safari park, which lies between Liverpool and Manchester, warned spectators to put food away

Mrs Conway, from Bebington, said: ‘They cleaned the wound and told us to keep an eye on his sleeping pattern to make sure he was OK. They’d never seen anything like it but they said that he was lucky he wasn’t blinded.’

She added: ‘We are just grateful that he got away with just scratches and nothing else.’

Mr Conway, who is an electrical engineer, said that their elder son was also shaken up and has had nightmares about the incident.

‘Zak has been really affected by it,’ he said. ‘He loves animals and wanted to be a zoo keeper before this happened.

‘The night after, he woke up screaming saying the bird was going to take him away.’

Knowsley Safari Park, which has been holding its bird of prey show for 19 years, said it was an isolated incident but has put measures in place to ensure it doesn’t happen again.

The name 'vulture' comes from the Latin word for 'tearer' and refers to the bird's aggressive feeding habits.

American Black Vultures, also known as Black Vultures, have a poor sense of smell and so often follow less aggressive Turkey Vultures to carcases, before driving them away and feasting on the meat themselves.

They eat carrion, or rotting corpses, but also may kill or injure newborn mammals, for example, pecking a newborn calf's eyes out before killing it.  Black vultures also feed at rubbish dumps.

In the wild they are found in southern parts of the United States, Mexico, Central America and most of South America, as well as on the Caribbean islands. 

An adult black vulture can grow to have a wingspan of 5ft 5ins (167cm) and a weight of around 6lbs. 

Richard Smith, head of visitor services at Knowsley Safari Park said: ‘Gauntlet, who run the Birds Of Prey display, reported that their hand-reared vulture had hopped on to a soft-topped pram during the free-flying display ... In the thousands of free-flying displays that have taken place at Knowsley Safari, this is a first-time occurrence.

‘Following this incident, we have revised our procedures and now babies are requested to sit on their parents’ knees, and pushchairs are not allowed in the area.’

Mr Conway said: ‘We don’t want anything to happen to the bird or for the bird shows to stop.

‘We just want extra precautions put in place such as not allowing prams.’ American black vultures have broad, powerful wings that reach a span of around 5ft.

They also have short, hooked beaks that they use to tear apart meat – and although they mainly eat carrion they have also been known to kill and eat young or injured animals.

They have a reputation for aggression and often hunt in flocks. It it is one of the few species of vultures that prey on cattle, swarming and overcoming new-born calves.
