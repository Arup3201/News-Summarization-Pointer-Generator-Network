The incredible moment a fisherman whooped for joy after freeing an enormous endangered whale that became trapped in heavy lines, has been caught on film.

Adrian Colaprete jumped in the water armed with a long knife and a Go Pro camera initially to assess the situation.

But as the giant whale loomed towards him, and a window to free the animal was presented, he reached out and sliced through the heavy rope, before the creature dived deep.

Tangled: The giant right whale with a heavy fishing rope hooked around it was eventually freed by a brave fisherman armed with a knife

Ecstatic Mr Colaprete afterwards said 'it just felt right' and described the moment as one of the best in his life.

Speaking to Pilot Online, Mr Colaprete said: 'Being part of it was something bigger than me.'

Joined
 by two friends, the men were out fishing on a Foster's charter boat, 
based in Rudee Inlet, Virgina, and were about 50 miles off Virginia 
Beach coast when they had the extraordinary encounter.

In an interview with the news service, Pat Foster said he was first to spot the animal when they were fishing on Friday.Â

As the whale reached him, the rope was clearly visible and the animal appeared to slow down

It wasn't 'uncommon' he said to see whales in the area, but when he realised it was a right whale his interest was piqued.

Right whales are rarely seen since they were hunted almost to extinction in the 19th century. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, there are thought to be only 400 in existence.

As he watched the whale, he also realised there was a problem with some fishing gear, since two poly balls were being dragged close to each other; 'that spells trouble in our field,' he said.

Realising the whale was still close by, they turned the boat around and followed it, and saw that the heavy lines were tangled around its body.

Mr Foster said they watched the whale's pattern of coming up for air and then his friend Mr Colaprete jumped in.

'I told him to be careful, it's a very large animal, we don't want whatever's entangled, if it was entangled, to get around him,' he told the news service.

At first Mr Colaprete couldn't see the whale, since he had jumped in in front of it. Then he saw it looming out from the depths, 'almost like a submarine coming at me,' he said.

'It was kind of scary at first,' he told the Pilot Online.

But as the whale's eyes came in line with his, the creature incredibly slowed, he said, allowing him time to reach forward and cut the rope as it passed.

Immediately, the pressure of the rope was released, and the tackle fell down into the depths.

'Extraordinary': Diver Mr Colaprete described the moment as one of he best in his life

Surfacing with the camera, Mr Colaprete caught a final glimpse of the endangered whale's tail before it submerged into the deep.

Although he said he realised he could have been in danger, Mr Colaprete told the news service the moment felt right so he went for it.

Pilot Online points out that people are supposed to get authorization from the National Marine Fisheries Service, to free a tangled whale, and to notify the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
