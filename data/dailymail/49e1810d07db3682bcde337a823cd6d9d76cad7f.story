The UK capital was ranked second and third place respectively, while the American city scooped first and second place.

However, Dubai squeezed them both out of the top spot for shopping to be crowned the best destination on the planet for buying goods while on holiday.

Tokyo scored top marks for helpfulness of locals, taxi service, local public transportation, and cleanliness of streets, ranking among the top ten in 13 of 16 categories in the survey.

The Cities Survey, which ranks each of the major tourist destinations in the world according to how well they scored across a number of different categories, is based on more than 54,000 reviews.

London scored highly for attractions (4th in the world), but less well on value for money (34th out of 37).

And with London’s taxi drivers made it into the top ten most friendly around the world.

As well as nightlife, New York City was also top of the heap for restaurants, and it came in second for best overall experience, shopping and attractions. 

Other high-ranking cities included Singapore, number one for comfort travelling alone, and second for taxi service, and family-friendliness; and Rome, which topped the list of attractions to do and culture.

James Kay, TripAdvisor spokesman, said: ‘London has always had a lot to offer tourists, so it is no surprise to see the capital ranking high for nightlife, shopping and attractions. 

‘But it seems we Londoners can still learn a lot from the friendly residents of Tokyo when it comes to making visitors to the city feel at ease.’
