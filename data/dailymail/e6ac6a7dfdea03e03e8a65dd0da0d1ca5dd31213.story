The ex-boyfriend of Amanda Knox has lifted the lid on their whirlwind romance in a tell-all book, admitting for the first time how they behaved 'oddly' in the aftermath of the murder of British student Meredith Kercher.

Italian Raffaele Solecito was convicted alongside Knox in 2009 of killing Miss Kercher but the pair were freed last October after their convictions 
were overturned due to a lack of evidence.

Miss Kercher, a 21-year-old from Leeds University, was found 
semi-naked and with her throat cut in a house she shared with Knox in Perugia, Italy, in November 2007.

Now in his new book, Honour Bound: My Journey to Hell and Back with Amanda Knox, Sollecito blows open the the early days of his relationship with the American that sparked a such fervid speculation over their involvement in the crime.

In it, he maintains the couple's innocence but acknowledges that their sometimes 'bizarre behaviour' after Miss Kercher's death gave police reason for 
suspicion.

He describes how their romance 
became a nightmare with the horror of Miss Kercher's death, the 
misunderstandings that swept them up in the case, and their tabloid 
portrayals as two suspects unrecognisable to themselves.

Miss Knox 
became 'Foxy Knoxy' and received the brunt of the attention as she 
shopped for underwear after the killing and turned cartwheels in front 
of investigators.

Sollecito tells how he met Knox at a classical music concert in Perugia before going on to spend the night with her.

The pair were filmed kissing, cuddling and stroking each other outside as the police were investigating the murder

Within a week, Miss Kercher was murdered and the couple fell instantly under the spotlight of suspicion.

In the hours after the gruesome 
murder scene was discovered, the duo was notoriously photographed 
kissing and cuddling in the street outside while police investigated.

Italian authorities 
later described Sollecito’s behaviour ass ‘odd’, and acknowledged the two had 
no real alibi 'except each other.'

Brutal murder: Meredith Kercher was killed in her apartment on November 1, 2007

They eventually told police that they had been smoking marijuana and having sex in Sollecito's apartment before falling asleep.

The pair was imprisoned days after the November 1, 2007 death of Kercher in the central Italian city. Both would remain there for nearly four years.

An appeals court overturned their conviction and freed them last fall, issuing a 143-page opinion that blasted the utter lack of evidence against them.

Rudy Guede, a petty criminal who was convicted separately, remains imprisoned and is serving a 16-year-sentence.

Sollecito's book, Honor Bound, is due out September 18. The Associated Press purchased a copy Tuesday.

In the book, he describes how the early days of their relationship became a nightmare: the horror of Kercher's slaying; the misunderstandings that swept them up in the case.

While police investigated the crime scene, Sollecito caressed her and they kissed, unaware of the television news cameras across the street.

Later at the police station she climbed in his lap and draped her arms over him, making Sollecito uneasy, he said.

Studying abroad: Knox shared a house with Kersher in Perugia, outside of Rome

Police found their behaviour 'odd' and he acknowledged they had no 'real alibi the night of November 1 except each other.'

Knox is also writing a book, due out next spring. Her deal, with HarperCollins, is reportedly worth $4 million.

Honor bound: Sollecito's book will be released on September 18th

The
couple were arrested several days after Kercher's death and later 
convicted in proceedings that made headlines around the world.

Prosecutors portrayed the case as a 
drug-fuelled sexual assault, and Knox and Sollecito were sentenced to 26
years and 25 years, respectively.

The
appeals court found the prosecution's theory to be unsupported by any 
evidence.

Prosecutors have appealed the acquittal, and Italy's highest 
court will hear their arguments next March.

Sollecito frequently criticizes the police for their handling of the case, reaching for a far-fetched conspiracy instead of the simpler explanation that Guede had on his own committed a burglary gone wrong.

Sollecito, then finishing his undergraduate studies in computer science, writes that he met Knox at a classical music concert at the Universita per Stranieri, the University for Foreigners, on October 25, 2007 - a week before Kercher's death.

He asked for her number, and she told him to come by the bar where she'd be working later that night.

At the end of the shift, he writes, they took a walk, held hands and kissed. She accepted an invitation to come back to his apartment and spent the night.

Soon the couple became inseparable. She began spending the nights at his apartment. They shopped for groceries together, and took a sightseeing day trip to Assisi.

Release: Knox, pictured right at Rome's airport, gave an emotional press conference once she got back home in Washington, left, a day after she was acquitted of murder in October 2011

Sollecito wrote about his first night in prison, saying he wavered between 'great waves of indignation and a nagging sense of guilt.' 

He said that while he knew he was innocent, he was angry at himself for having a foggy memory of the night of the killing because he and Knox had smoked marijuana.

When they were finally acquitted, Sollecito writes that he felt 'indescribable joy.' He remembers looking at the police, hoping to see them appear defeated, but they wouldn't look at him. 

He saw Knox sobbing, and they later had a private moment in the basement of the courthouse, waiting to be taken back to prison one last time.

According to Sollecito, she squeezed his hand and said she couldn't wait to see her home and friends.

Knox moved back to Seattle, and has since been pictured adjusting to life back in the States.  It's not clear where Sollecito is living.

Guilty: Rudy Guede, a drug dealer, was convicted of Kercher's murder

Meredith Kercher, a British student studying abroad in Perugia, was found murdered in the flat she shared with U.S. student Amanda Knox on November 1, 2007. She, along with Knox and Sollecito were studying at the city’s University for Foreigners.

In the days following the murder, Knox, her Italian boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito, and Perugian resident Rudy Guede were all arrested for the grisly crime. 

The horrific murder of the bright young woman shocked the world, and for the next four years, the world watched as Knox and Sollecito were put on trial for the murder of the 21-year-old, who suffered 43 separate knife wounds. 

While being questioned by the police following the murder of her flatmate, Knox was reportedly performing cartwheels in the station and sat on Sollecito’s lap during the interrogation.

However, during her appeal, Knox addressed her actions, saying: ‘Everyone deals with tragedy in their own way.’

Guede, a drug dealer who was originally from the Ivory Coast, was later convicted of the murder. 

While Knox and Sollecito were acquitted of their charges, authorities rejected Guede's appeal after his DNA was found inside of Kersher’s body. 

To this day, there are many unknowns in the case, though the prosecution’s original story – that Guede broke into the cottage and tried to rape Kercher with the assistance of a drug-addled Knox and Sollecito – is deeply flawed and is now known to be far from the truth.
