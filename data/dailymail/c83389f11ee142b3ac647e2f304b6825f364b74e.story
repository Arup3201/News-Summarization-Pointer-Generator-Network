A group of police officers have recreated an old Victorian photograph to pay tribute to a constable who was murdered nearly 150 years ago.

PC Ebenezer Tye, 24, was beaten to death with a cudgel as he tried to stop a burglar escaping in Halesworth, Suffolk, on November 25, 1862.

His killer, John Ducker, confessed to the murder on the gallows and was the last person to be publicly hanged in Suffolk.

Five of PC Tye’s stern-faced colleagues in top hats were later photographed posed around his newly inscribed gravestone in Halesworth cemetery.

The fading black-and-white picture has now been recreated by five Suffolk police officers currently serving in the Halesworth and Southwold area as a tribute to the dead PC.

The five officers — Inspector Nick Aitken, Sgt John Shuttleworth, PC Andrew Phillips, PC Trudie Beckwith and PC Chris Sadler — all gathered around the grave in their modern uniforms.

PC Tye was murdered while on duty after being tasked with keeping an eye on local burglar Ducker, who was suspected of raiding local properties.

The police officer had spotted Ducker carrying a suspicious-looking bundle in Chediston Street, Halesworth, and went to question him.

There were shouts and a chase towards the reedbeds beside the River Blyth at the back of Chediston Street.

Later that morning, after Tye failed to return to the police station, a search was made. His body was found in the river. He had been beaten with a cudgel.

Ducker was subsequently caught, charged, tried for murder and sentenced to death. He confessed to the crime moments before he was hanged in Ipswich in 1863. 

More than 5,000 people attended the public hanging.

In addition to the portrait tribute, a special exhibition to honour PC Tye on the 150th anniversary of his murder is to be held at Halesworth and District Museum with the help of Suffolk Police Museum

PC Chris Sadler, of Southwold & Halesworth Safer Neighbourhood Team, said: 'This case shows policing has always been a dangerous profession and that officers put their lives on the line even in comparatively rural areas to protect local communities and catch criminals.

'We also think that, while many things have changed, the basics of policing — fighting crime, keeping the roads safe and the problems of young men drinking a bit too much on a Friday night — will have been largely the same 150 years ago as it is today.

'My initial idea was just to recreate the photograph to pay some tribute to him but I spoke to Halesworth Museum about the idea and they offered to put on a display to commemorate the anniversary.

'Some exhibits are being transferred from our museum at police headquarters and, thanks to their support, a number of items about policing will now be on view from the end of the month.'

A Suffolk Police spokeswoman said: 'In Ebenezer Tye’s day it was expected that officers would blow their whistles to get their colleagues' attention or shout the phrase "Look up, Bill," which would tell the other officers that something was happening — it appears that Tye never got that chance.

'Today officers have radios to summon help and, in addition to batons, they carry Pava spray and wear stab vests to help protect in the event of attack.'

The exhibition at Halesworth and District Museum will feature some of the material associated with the crime, including case papers, as well as other items including the uniform of officers at the time.

The display will run from November 27 to December 15. The museum will be open from 10am to 12.30pm, from Tuesday to Saturday, and admission is free.
