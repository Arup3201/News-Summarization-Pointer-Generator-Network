A heartbroken family has been ordered to demolish their dream £500,000 home - after bungling builders made it 6ft too high and 4ft too wide.

Car sales manager Andy Murray, 51, paid £164,000 for a building plot and a further £300,000 constructing the four-bedroom property.

He left the project in the hands of his architects and builders but claims they failed to follow the plans.

The local council rejected Andrew Murray's planning application because his house in Glasgow had exceeded size guidelines

Council officials objected to the large balcony at the rear or the property and claimed if they allowed it to remain it would set a precedent

After the home was built and fitted with a £27,000 kitchen and four bathrooms costing £25,000, the council stepped in and ordered it to be demolished.

Mr Murray and his wife Frances, 53, will even be charged £11,500 for demolition - due to take place next week - and will have to sell his current home, valued at £350,000, to cover the debts.

The father-of-three, of Strathaven, Lanarkshire, said: 'It’s a disaster for us. We’ll be out on the street.

'I don’t blame the council. They have exhausted every other avenue.'

Planners at East Dunbartonshire Council in Scotland say the property is more than 6ft higher, 9ft longer and 4ft wider than the plans stated and also has too many windows and an unapproved 13ft balcony.

Mr Murray said that some of the interior fittings inside the property, pictured, have been removed and the interior has been vandalised

Now, the property which is much larger than others in the area, pictured rear, will be demolished on Tuesday

In a letter to the council, Andy said he had put 'trust and faith in the professionalism of our friend who we understood to be reputable builder who would oversee the project on our behalf'.

He added: 'However, it is now evident that we were too trustworthy and that we did not give the project the attention that we should have.'

Thomas Glen, the council’s head of development and enterprise said: 'The house as constructed differs considerably from a previously-approved scheme, is not in line with local plan policy and guidance, and raises considerable amenity and potential precedent issues.

'Following the decision, the council’s planning service will initiate formal enforcement action.'

Mr Murray claims builders Textura and the architects told him the home would meet council regulations and planning consent would be given retrospectively.

But in the two years since the house was put up it still has neither planning permission nor a building warrant.

A spokesperson for the architect firm CRGP who are based at this building in Glasgow said: 'We cannot make any comment at this time'

It also lacks an electricity supply, plumbing and a waste water system.

The builders have now gone bankrupt and it is thought subcontractors were not paid and stripped out fixtures and fittings.

The house has also been broken into and vandalised.

Mr Murray said: 'The whole thing has had a terrible effect on my family. It is a financial catastrophe.

'To invest all this money in a new home and lose it, and lose my old home because of the huge debts is beyond a nightmare.

'We were never rich. But we worked hard to attain what we thought was a comfortable position. All of that is gone now and we don’t know where to turn.'

Mr Murray used Textura UK Ltd to build the house who used CRGP Ltd Architects and Surveyors to lodge the unsuccessful planning application with East Dunbartonshire Council.

John and Mary Houston, who live next door to the house, said they were 'heartbroken' for the Murrays.

Mr Houston, 76, said: 'The council has been out in our garden checking it out. One official said the side wall looks like the Berlin Wall.

'It’s tragic for Andy and his family.'

Mrs Houston, 74, said: 'We know the house is out of place here but in all honesty we would rather it was allowed to stay.'

According to company records, the building firm Textura UK Ltd is in 'voluntary creditors' liquidation' and not able to comment.

A spokesperson for the architect firm CRGP said: 'We cannot make any comment at this time.'
