Women who take the contraceptive pill for more than three years are twice as likely to suffer from an eye condition that can lead to blindness

Women who take the contraceptive pill for more than three years are twice as likely to suffer from an eye condition that can lead to blindness, a new study has found.

The research revealed women who take the pill are more likely to develop glaucoma.

The condition occurs when the drainage tubes within the eyes become blocked, preventing fluid from draining properly and causing pressure to build up, damaging the optic nerve and nerves from the retina.

In England alone around 480,000 people have the most common form of glaucoma, which is most often seen in white Europeans.

The new study is the first to establish an increased risk of glaucoma in women who have used oral contraceptives.

Scientists have now urged gynaecologists and ophthalmologists to tell women of the increased risk and to screen for the condition.

The eye damage caused by glaucoma cannot be reversed but prompt treatment will halt the progression of the condition.

Dr Shan Lin of the University of California in San Francisco said: ‘This study should be an impetus for future research to prove the cause and effect of oral contraceptives and glaucoma.

‘At this point, women who have taken oral contraceptives for three or more years should be screened for glaucoma and followed closely by an ophthalmologist.’

The researchers used data from 2005 to 2008 in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.

This included 3,406 female participants aged 40 years or older from across the U.S. who completed the survey’s vision and reproductive health questionnaire and underwent eye examinations.

It found women who had used oral contraceptives, no matter which kind, for longer than three years were 2.05 times more likely to also report that they had been diagnosed with glaucoma.

Although there was no direct causative effect of oral contraceptives on the development of glaucoma, it indicates that long-term use of oral contraceptives might be a potential risk factor for glaucoma.

Previous studies have shown that oestrogen may play a significant role in the development of glaucoma.

Women who take the pill are more likely to develop glaucoma - a condition that occurs when the drainage tubes in the eyes become blocked, preventing fluid from draining properly and causing pressure to build up damaging the optic nerve and nerves from the retina

The finding was presented at the 117th Annual Meeting of the American Academy of Ophthalmology in New Orleans.

About one in 50 white Europeans over the age of 40 have glaucoma, as do one in 10 people over the age of 75.

The most common form of glaucoma - chronic open-angle glaucoma - progresses very slowly and often does not cause any noticeable symptoms.

However, over time the patient will start to lose vision from the outer rim of their eye.

The loss of vision will slowly move inwards towards the centre of the eye.

Glaucoma is a term that describes a group of eye conditions that affect vision.

It usually affects both eyes but in varying degrees.

It occurs when the drainage tubes within the eye become blocked. This prevents eye fluid from draining properly.

When the fluid cannot drain, pressure builds up. This can damage the optic nerve and nerve fibres from the retina.

There are four main types of glaucoma - the most common is chronic open-angle glaucoma. This develops very slowly.

The other types are rarer but tend to be more severe.

The condition can be treated with eye drops, laser treatment or surgery.

However, early diagnosis is important because any damage to the eyes cannot be reversed.

If left untreated, glaucoma can cause visual impairment.

Glaucoma affects about 480,000 people in England alone.

Chronic open-angle glaucoma is most common among white Europeans.
