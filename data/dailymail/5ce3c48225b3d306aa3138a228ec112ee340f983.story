'Highly dangerous': Richard Todd, 25, failed to return to HMP Standford Hill after being let out on day released

A 'highly dangerous' inmate was at the centre of a major police hunt tonight after going on the run from prison.

Richard Todd, 25, failed to return to HMP Standford Hill after being granted day release just over a month ago.

The inmate was five-and-a-half years into an indeterminate sentence for robbery, taking without consent and burglary offences when he disappeared from the prison in Eastchurch, Kent.

Since then he has been linked to a brawl in Staines, Surrey, on December 12, and a burglary in nearby Sunbury-on-Thames on December 13.

Tonight detectives warned the public not to approach Todd and instead to dial 999.

Detective Sergeant Dave Thomas said: 
'Richard Todd is a highly dangerous individual and I would urge members 
of the public not to approach him but to phone police immediately if 
they believe they have seen him.

'We are making extensive inquiries to 
try to find him and ensure he is back behind bars but would ask the 
public to help by reporting any potential sightings on the 999 emergency
number.

'If you have information about his 
whereabouts but donâ€™t want to speak to the police, you can also pass 
information to independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously by calling 
0800 555 111.'

Todd, who appeared on Crimestoppers 
website 'Most Wanted' list, was described as white, around 5ft 11ins 
tall, of proportionate build, with short brown hair and hazel eyes.

He was living in the Hayes area prior to his incarceration but also has links to Staines and Basingstoke.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
