For the beaming parents of the bride and groom, it was a day of joy.

For Sian Lloyd, however, it was a distinctly miserable one.

The weather presenter put on a brave face after being shunned from her step-daughter’s wedding to Tony and Cherie Blair’s son Euan at the weekend.

Tying the knot: Euan Blair and Suzanne Ashman emerge from the church in Buckinghamshire

Wearing a strained smile, the 
55-year-old cut a lonely figure as she left a London hotel restaurant, 
clearly unhappy as she missed being part of Suzanne Ashman’s big day.

Miss
Lloyd had been set to attend the ceremony at the Blairs’ £5million 
estate in Buckinghamshire, but at the last minute was told she was no 
longer welcome and met with a ‘wall of silence’ when she asked why.

So
instead of donning her party dress and accompanying her husband, 
Jonathan Ashman, to the former Prime Minister’s home, she was forced to 
wave him off alone before heading to the Sherlock Holmes Hotel.

Her outfit of blue jeans, tan boots and a flat cap was somewhat more casual than the one she had originally planned.

And rather than joining the bride, 25,
and groom, 29, for a celebratory feast, she had a quiet lunch with 
friends and raised a glass of champagne to the happy couple.

In
the days leading up to the wedding Miss Lloyd wrote in a series of 
emails to a friend: ‘No, no reinvite has followed the disinvite. 
Original invite on table here, with Sian & Jonathan writ large on 
envelope... but alas, alack & woe is me.

‘Designer
dress and posh high heels returned to wardrobe with a sigh... back to 
weather charts to try and deliver a sunny day for tomorrow’s newlyweds.’

Mr Ashman, 64, a 
motor-racing entrepreneur, was so angry at his wife’s treatment he 
threatened to boycott the wedding, while Miss Lloyd, who married him in 
2007, was said to be ‘flabbergasted’ by the snub.

Friends
speculated it could have something to do with her opposition to Mr 
Blair’s stance on Syria. But she is also known to have had a ‘difficult’
relationship with Suzanne’s mother and Mr Ashman’s first wife, Sedef, 
from whom he was divorced 13 years ago.

A
friend said: ‘Sian tried to make an effort with Suzanne but because of 
her mother she wouldn’t give an inch. They both looked down on her and 
she gained the impression that they thought she was a bit of an 
embarrassment.’
