Fashion and politics often crossover. 

Fashion weeks are met with anti-fur protesters and there are constant debates about the working conditions of people employed by clothing manufacturers.

So it should come as no surprise to see sensitive subjects make an appearance at Paris Fashion.

Day three of the event saw several designers pushing boundaries with their creative choices.

Hussein Chalayan closed his SS15 show with a revealing dress illustrated with a woman wearing a Niqab

Hussein Chalayan presented a collection of floaty evening dresses that revealed patches of bare flesh and came in a wash of grey tones. However, one particular dress caught the spectators attention.

In his finale, the piece was completed with an illustration of a woman in a full Niqab slinking up the side split of the slender model. Other pieces in the collection featured silk jumpsuits and matching hats printed with army camouflage.

The collection certainly displayed certain parallels with the current world conflicts but Chalayan insists that this was not his inspiration and said it actually reflected the relationship between Spain and Maghreb.

This is not the first time that the Turkish designer has caused controversy with his use of traditional dress in his clothing lines.

In his most famous collection which he presented 16 years ago, displayed models all wearing a traditional burka in a line. However, each model became more and more naked until one was completely nude as they got further along the line.

On the very same day that Chalayan presented his SS15 range another designer linked their line back to one of the world's most well-known political issues, with Russian president Vladimir Putin taking centre stage at the Talbot Runhof SS15 Collection.

The much opposed leader appeared across the t-shirts of the models in the form of tourist posters with slogans such as 'Visit Milan..Before He Does!'

The design took inspiration from t-shirts that were sold at Moscow's Gum department stores printed with images of Putin in a Hawaiian shirt, cocktail in hand, with the headline stating: 'Greetings from Crimea'.

The Tenesse design duo are open in saying that they hope that their controversial tops will help make a statement.

They told Women's Wear Daily: 'We thought the fact that some people buy those and are wearing them with pride was an interesting fashion statement,' Talbot said, 'and we thought we use our cute little sporty collection as a form of protest.'

Johnny Talbot and Adrian Runhof have previously used their collections as an opportunity to make a political statement. 

Last season they aimed to make a stand for gay rights when they used an image of a young man holding up a 'corduroy skirts are a sin' sign, as he stood next to an anti-gay activist in that very item of clothing as the inspiration for the collection.

Loewe SS15 selection of models seemed abnormally slim in comparison to other catwalks 

Over sized handbags and baggy blouses accentuate the women's small frames

In another bold move at day three of the Paris' most stylish event a fashion hot-topic reared its familiar head.

The issue of using super skinny models has been one that has plagued the fashion industry for years. It is widely agreed that the use of them can cause young girls to develop eating disorders and after furious campaigning the fashion industry has seen far less of them.

As it currently stands models with a body mass index of 18 or under were banned from Madrid Fashion Week and in 2012, Vogue made a pact to protect the health of models by banning all fashion models younger than 16 or ‘who appear to have an eating disorder’ from their pages. 

However, the models  who appeared on the runway of Loewe seemed to be of a smaller stature of those we have seen on the runway in recent years. 

Billowing silk blouses and over sized earrings accentuated the models' petite frames and stick-thin arms.

Loewe aren't the first designers to feature ultra-skinny women on their runway's with Armani coming under fire at Milan Fashion Week for the use of of their tiny models.

Day three of Paris fashion week saw more than its fair share of risky fashion, and whether it will be met with applause or criticism it is sure to keep everyone talking.
