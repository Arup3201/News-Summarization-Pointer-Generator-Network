Pretty in pink: Nigella Lawson, left, with her make-up artist Tricia Woolston

Nigella Lawson has ditched the gloomy black clothes she has worn since her split from husband Charles Saatchi in favour of a figure-hugging fuchsia dress.

The 53-year-old, who divorced the art tycoon in July, looked radiant as she attended a party in Los Angeles in the £95 dress, which was made especially for her by a British designer.

Accessorising with a flower crown and garland, the chef posed for a photo with her make-up artist Tricia Woolston as they celebrated the end of filming for her US cookery show The Taste.

Nigella appears as a star judge on the series, which has become a prime-time hit for American TV network ABC. She is rumoured to have been paid £500,000 to executive produce and appear in the second series.

A source said: ‘Nigella is looking better than ever. She’s smiling and laughing again. She thoroughly enjoyed her time in LA. She has been working exceptionally hard but she’s been surrounded by close friends and seems to be in great form.’

Nigella, who flew back to London on Friday, is due to start filming The Taste UK for Channel 4 tomorrow. Both the US and UK versions of the show will air early next year.

A spokesman for Kent-based The Pretty Dress Company, which designed Nigella’s dress, said last night: ‘Nigella loves our dresses. We made the shocking pink dress especially for her. It’s not available to the public right now but it will be shortly.’

Nigella split from Saatchi, 70, after he was photographed grabbing her throat outside aMayfair restaurant in June.

Saatchi, who initially described the incident as ‘a playful tiff’, is now said to be dating stylist Trinny Woodall.
