Dancers at the Royal Opera House are being paid less than box office assistants, the union which represents performers has revealed.

Professional freelance dancers in one production were paid just £9.14 an hour for entertaining thousands of audience members each week, according to Equity.

Meanwhile, the income of those selling tickets to customers was £10.70 per hour over the same period.

The Equity Freelance Dance Network, a branch of the union, has now called for a meeting with bosses at the Covent Garden venue in London to address the ‘huge disparity’, The Daily Telegraph reported last night.

In an open letter to the Royal Opera House, the union said that dancers felt that there was ‘a huge disparity and a lack of value when compared to the other work that freelancers carry out’.

The letter goes on to ask: ‘Why are we not paid above or at least equal to that amount when working for one of the largest, most heavily subsidised arts organisations in the country?

‘Particularly when compared to the wages of other artists working on any given opera.’

In one production of Krol Roger, a Polish opera due to be staged at the venue, the rate advertised for dancers is lower than the wage given to box office staff.

The union described the pay as ‘disheartening’ and said that it made performers feel ‘poorly’ valued.

The letter added: ‘What is often overlooked is the amount of time, effort and financial investment it requires for a freelance dancer to continue training in between jobs in order to be at a professional level when they start a job with someone like ROH.

‘The strong work ethic of dancers is well known within the industry, and we would hope that an organisation like ROH would be able to recognise this.’

The Royal Opera House said it was ‘in discussion’ with the union about the issue and that a meeting had been planned.

The spokesman added: ‘We hope to reach a mutually agreeable solution as soon as possible.’
