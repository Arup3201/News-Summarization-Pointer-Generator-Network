Brooklyn is the least-affordable housing market in America, where residents would need to spend 98 per cent of the average income to buy a median-priced home of $615,000.

One in five U.S. housing markets are now less affordable than they were more than a decade ago, according to a recent study, and Brooklyn is the the most unaffordable, followed by San Francisco and Manhatten.

According to a study of 475 countires by RealtyTrac through October, 98 areas weren't as affordable compared with the average level for the period starting in January 2000

Investors and foreign buyers are being blamed for the price-rise which has kept residents in rental properties where costs have also been rising. The median rent in Brooklyn was $2,858 in October, up almost 6 per cent from a year earlier.

Bloomberg reports that prices in 20 U.S. cities climbed 4.9 per cent in the year through September while values gained 25 per cent since their February 2012 crash.

Daren Blomquist, vice president at RealtyTrac said incomes had not grown 'nearly as fast as home prices'. 

He said the 'disconnected' had been driven by buyers who were not 'as constrained by income', resulting in homes now being out of reach for traditional buyers. 

Los Angeles and Orange County in California and the Houston, Dallas and Boston regions are among the 98 areas where homes were now less affordable.

Manhatten was the second most unaffordable place to buy, though New Yorkers being priced out of the area were being blamed for driving up prices in Brooklyn

Just last month a renovated 1890s townhouse in Brooklyn's Park Slope section sold for $10.78 million - a record for the neighborhood and Brooklyn's third-most-expensive purchase

To calculate affordability, RealtyTrac worked out what the median household income needed to make a monthly payment on a median-priced home. They also factored in a 10 per cent down deposit and put the mortgage over a 30-year period. 

Just 12 per cent of the countries studied have a higher median home price than the peak of the 2005-2008 property bubble.

In Brooklyn, the median sale price climbed to a record $587,515 in the third quarter, as New Yorkers priced out of Manhattan looked for affordable homes there.

Of all the counties analyzed by RealtyTrac, buying a median-priced home in October required on average 26 per cent of the median income. During the housing bubble it required 41 per cent in each of the country.
