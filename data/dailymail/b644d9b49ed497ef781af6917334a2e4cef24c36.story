Downing Street has given a 'final offer' over the proposed election TV debates, involving seven party leaders, including David Cameron

A ‘final offer’ has been given to broadcasters for David Cameron to take part in one, seven-way TV election debate.

Downing Street has accused the BBC and other networks of causing ‘chaos’ by attempting to dictate the terms of debates and repeatedly altering their proposals.

It said broadcasters had ignored Mr Cameron’s long-held position that televised clashes between leaders were over-dominant in the 2010 election campaign and should start earlier.

Number Ten is proposing a debate involving Mr Cameron, Ed Miliband, Nick Clegg, Nigel Farage, Green leader Natalie Bennett, SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon and Plaid Cymru’s Leanne Wood at the end of this month.

‘This is our final offer, and to be clear, given the fact this has been a deeply unsatisfactory process and we are within a month of the short campaign, the Prime Minister will not be participating in more than one debate,’ the Prime Minister’s director of communications Craig Oliver wrote to the BBC.

The Tories’ ultimatum is unlikely to be agreed by other parties, or broadcasters who each want to hold one debate, prompting doubts about whether any will now take place.

Mr Miliband has accused Mr Cameron of deliberately sabotaging negotiations over the debates and ‘running scared’.

He said last night he would ‘do it anytime, any place, anywhere’, adding: ‘David Cameron must now name the day.’

Labour is suggesting a proposed head-to-head clash between Mr Miliband and the Prime Minister also goes ahead featuring just the Labour leader, leaving him debating a studio audience.

However, sources at the main broadcasters concede it would be difficult to proceed if Mr Cameron does not agree to participate.

The 2010 election was the first to feature American-style TV debates between political leaders. In that campaign, there were three debates between the three main party leaders over three weeks.

X Factor-style push-button polling of viewers was used to declare a ‘winner’ in each case, with Mr Clegg’s initial success prompting so-called ‘Cleggmania’. Tory strategists believe that if the debates had not taken place, the Lib Dems would have fared worse and Mr Cameron would have won a majority.

Under plans unveiled by the BBC, ITV, Sky News and Channel 4 last year, for this election, Ukip’s Mr Farage would have been invited to take part in one debate also featuring Mr Cameron, Mr Miliband and Mr Clegg.

The Conservative, Labour and Lib Dem leaders were then to take part in a three-way discussion, before Mr Cameron and Mr Miliband went head-to-head in a final televised clash.

The Tories complained that the Green Party, which has been ahead of the Lib Dems in several polls, should be included.

Earlier this year, the broadcasters suggested an alternative format, which would have seen two clashes involving seven parties, including the Greens, Plaid Cymru and the Scottish Nationalists but excluding the DUP, followed by one head-to-head between Mr Cameron and Mr Miliband on April 30.

The latest proposals have angered senior Lib Dems, who complained that as a party of government they should not be reduced to minority party status.

Ukip, meanwhile, was angry that its position was diluted, while some Labour figures doubted the wisdom of taking part in two debates with the Greens and the SNP, both eating into their party’s vote.

In a letter to the BBC’s Sue Inglish, chair of the broadcasters’ leaders’ debates committee, Mr Oliver said he had ‘serious concerns about the way in which this has been handled from the start’.

‘Despite the Prime Minister having been clear about his concern around holding debates in the short campaign, you did not consult us before issuing a press release last October outlining your plans for three debates during that period,’ he said.

‘Had you consulted us, we could have also told you that we also did not think it was appropriate to exclude the Green Party from the process.

‘Despite all of this, we then entered into negotiations in good faith, during which I made the case for a more representative debates structure, including the Greens. It is fair to say that the desire to exclude the Greens was clear from all other parties present.

‘Three months later – and again without consultation – you surprised us again by proposing a new seven-party structure, this time not only inviting the Greens, but Plaid Cymru and the SNP as well. Again, this was a flawed proposal that has resulted in the DUP initiating what appears to be legitimate legal action.

‘Since this proposal has been suggested, there has been chaos. In recent weeks, you have avoided letting the parties sit in a room to hammer out proposals, making progress impossible.’

To ‘cut through this chaotic situation’, he said the Prime Minister would take part in one, 90-minute debate with the leaders of the Green Party, Labour, Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru, SNP and UKIP, to take place in the week of March 23.

A Labour source said: ‘Behind the scenes, Cameron’s team are doing everything they can to scupper the negotiations and sink the debates.’
