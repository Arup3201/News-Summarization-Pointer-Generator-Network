When keen vegetable grower Brian Caswell won the lottery, there was one thing money couldn’t buy.

His £24.9million EuroMillions fortune brought him a luxury farmhouse, with a Range Rover in his garage, and new homes for his daughters.

But the perfect carrot crop continued to elude him.

Honest: Brian Caswell admits if he'd won the money when he was younger it might have changed him more

Pride: Mr Caswell is still a regular at his allotment in Bolton, Greater Manchester despite his huge win

The 77-year-old grandfather won the 
jackpot three years ago, and admitted at the time that the performance 
of his carrots on his beloved allotment was one of his few regrets.

‘I
have been trying to grow carrots ever since I have been on that plot 
and I have never had any success,’ he said. ‘I have followed every 
instruction in the book and never had a single success.’

He promised, however, that life as a multi-millionaire would not see him abandon his blessed plot.

And
not only has he been true to his word, but with much more time to 
devote to his hobby, he has at last conquered his carrot conundrum. His 
secret? Growing them in pots with fresh compost.

Keen: Mr Caswell's win has allowed him to get night vision cameras fitted to the allotment to watch wildlife

Mr Caswell said: ‘My allotment is 
still a lovely place to go to get away from it all. But one thing that 
has changed since the lottery win is my approach to growing carrots.

‘I could never grow them before the 
win and then I was given a tip to grow them in pots. Apparently they 
always come up because you’re putting in a fresh supply of compost. 
That’s what I’m doing now and it works.’

That leaves him with only one ambition
unfulfilled since his numbers came up – the slightly more costly desire
to visit South America.

Mr Caswell was chairman of the Harpers
Lane Allotment Society in Bolton when he became one of the country’s 
largest EuroMillions winners in 2009.

Since then he has swapped the modest 
semi where he and his wife Joan, 76, spent the first 50 years of their 
marriage and bought a £1.25million five-bedroom farmhouse three miles 
away.

As well as the Range Rover, the 
retired export manager for a brewery engineering firm has bought homes 
for daughters Helen, 51, and Angela, 47, with land and stables.

But after the early days during which 
his £35-a-month allotment began to look understandably neglected, he has
been true to his word, busily perfecting his vegetable-growing skills.

‘I have got fruit trees with plums, damsons, tomatoes,’ he said. ‘I also
have onions and, of course, carrots. I don’t plant anything unless it 
gives me something back. I have still got my damson jam from last year.’

New wheels: Mr Caswell did splash out on this Range Rover but insists he hasn't let his new wealth change him

His wealth has enabled him to cut a 
few corners, he admitted. ‘The win has allowed me to enjoy my passion 
more of course – and allowed me to employ someone to help.’

The pensioner said the lottery win had
not changed the family. ‘Long before the win we always went away as a 
family, all ten of us, once a year. We still keep that up,’ he said.

‘If I was 40 when it happened then it 
probably would have changed me more because you have got a long life 
ahead of you, but I have not got that privilege at my age.

‘I still play the lottery because as someone said to me recently, I have as much chance as anybody else.’
