Two senior Blairites approached Alan Johnson last year to ask whether he would consider taking over from Ed Miliband, it emerged last night.

Lord Mandelson and Alastair Campbell contacted the former Home Secretary in the autumn to see if he wanted to replace Mr Miliband as Labour leader, according to the Financial Times. 

Both men have been forced to deny they encouraged Mr Johnson to put himself forward as Labour leader when Mr Miliband's leadership hit rock bottom in November last year. 

Peter Mandelson and Alastair Campbell held talks with Alan Johnson amid growing speculation that he would take the helm of the party to prevent a second election defeat

Mr Johnson has ruled out ever standing for the Labour leadership, to the dismay of his many supporters in the party

The Financial Times reported that former Business Secretary Lord Mandelson and New Labour spin doctor Mr Campbell approached Mr Johnson to see whether he would be interested in replacing the hapless Mr Miliband as leader.

According to one Labour MP, Mr Johnson gave an 'emphatic No' – as he has in public.

But it was seen as a sign of the growing sense of desperation in the Labour party in the wake of Mr Miliband's disastrous party conference speech in which he forgot to mention the deficit.

Mr Johnson served in the Cabinet for six years and was seen as a safe pair of hands, popular with the media and the public.

After Mr Miliband won the Labour leadership he appointed Mr Johnson as shadow chancellor, but he remained in post for just three months, resigning after revelations about his wife having an affair.

However, many still view the former postman and trade union leader as a possible caretaker leader if Mr Miliband's woeful personal ratings risked prevent Labour winning the election. 

Labour leader Ed Miliband has come under fresh pressure in recent days over mounting criticism from business leaders

Stuart Rose, former M&S chairman: 'Labour's attack this week on a major British business smacked of the destructive anti-business mood that went out of political fashion decades ago.'

Lord Digby Jones, former Labour trade minister: 'It's a much bigger problem with business. I think that they're scraping the bottom of the barrel... they haven't got the support that New Labour used to have years ago.'

Yo! Sushi founder Simon Woodroffe, who once appeared in a Labour party advert:  'You know it scares me. I was a Labour Party supporter during the Blair-Brown thing and I was a supporter because I am a believer that politics needs to make money, that UK PLC needs to be a profitable business, and I thought they were a good management team.'

Pizza Express founder Luke Johnson: 'Take freezing energy prices – an example of how the Opposition are ignorant of the way markets and capitalism works.'

Brent Hoberman, co-founder of Lastminute.com: 'Should Labour get elected then what we may well find is that it will be similar to what Hollande did in France, in that he sends businesses away and investment out of the country and then he does a U-turn and it's almost too late.' 

Charlie Mullins, founder Pimlico Plumbers: 'I'm one business owner who isn't going to keep quiet about the destructive power of having a business-hating government with Ed Miliband at the helm.'

Boots chief Stefano Pessina said: 'If they acted as they speak, it would be a catastrophe. The problem is, would they act that way or not? One thing is to threaten and to shout, but it is completely different to be in charge and to manage the country day to day.' 

New Labour supporters were seen as being closer to Mr Miliband's brother David, but he stepped down as an MP after losing the leadership against to his brother.

At least 40 Labour MPs are believed to have backed the abortive coup, which occurred weeks after the Labour leader's conference speech last autumn.

The FT article said that the paper had learned that 'two Labour grandees — Lord Mandelson, the former business secretary, and Alastair Campbell, Tony Blair's former press chief — took soundings from Johnson to see whether he was prepared to take over.

'Alan gave an emphatic No,' says one Labour MP. Another senior party figure claimed that at least 40 MPs supported the abortive coup — others claim far more.'

Tensions between Mr Miliband and New Labour grandees have been renewed in recent days, after losing the support of business leaders seen as crucial to Mr Blair's three election triumphs. 

However, Lord Mandelson today insisted he had not encouraged Mr Johnson to challenge Mr Miliband, but only asked if rumours about him standing were true.

He said: 'As he is a good friend of mine, we talked about the press frenzy going on at the time and he said it was all nonsense. End of conversation, end of story.' 

A Labour spokesman for the Labour party said the story was 'false and misleading'.

'This story is nonsense,' he said. 'Both Peter Mandelson and Alastair Campbell have made it crystal clear to the FT that they spoke to Alan Johnson only to see if the newspaper rumours were correct.

'They were not sounding him out or encouraging him to stand but checking the accuracy of reports in the press. They discovered that those reports were false and misleading, just as is today's story in the FT.'

But Tory MP Nadhim Zahawi said: 'Six months out from the General Election those at the highest levels of the Labour party were plotting to remove Ed Miliband.

'This just proves Ed Miliband is not up to the job of being Prime Minster and his own party knows it. Ed Miliband in Downing Street would spell chaos for Britain.' 

The leadership speculation comes at the end of a week when captains of industry and entrepreneurs have lined up to warn against a Labour victory.

Business leaders credited with the success of well-known chains including Boots, M&S, Pizza Express and Lastminute.com have turned their fire on Labour in recent days, warning victory for Mr Miliband would plunge Britain into an economic catastrophe.

Sir Charles Dunstone, who was one of 63 signatories to a letter of support for Labour in 2005, told the Financial Times the business community felt 'isolated' by Labour's shift to the left.

'As a business person I'm frightened of an environment where there isn't sufficient emphasis put on growing the economy to grow tax receipts to spend more money,' he said.

However, Lord Levy, formerly Tony Blair's chief fundraiser who helped New Labour form close ties with business, said he was 'saddened' by the attacks on Mr Miliband.

He insisted that he had not given up on Labour working with business under Mr Miliband and attempted to play down the damage caused by attacks from leaders of large firms and shadow chancellor Ed Balls's televised memory lapse over the name of the party's small business adviser Bill Thomas.

The peer told BBC Radio 4's The World At One: 'I'm somewhat saddened that people like Sir Charles Dunstone, whom I have great respect for, has said what he has said.

'Ed Balls, obviously, no one likes to have a touch of amnesia and forgetting Bill Thomas's name was one of those things that happened.

'But really the key issue is where does Labour stand with business. Frankly I don't think any political party can ignore business, they have to work with business, they have to work with a broad spectrum of society.' 

Businesses will today be promised a £10billion boost by cutting red tape in the Conservative manifesto as the party seeks to exploit Labour’s damaging row with captains of industry.

In an interview with the Daily Mail, business minister Matthew Hancock set out plans to cut red tape, saving firms an average of £2,000 a year.

He also signalled the party is preparing to offer tax breaks to start-up companies taking on their first employees and further steps to rein in vexatious employment tribunal claims. Mr Hancock said the Tories would go into the election as ‘unashamedly pro-business and pro-enterprise’, committing to more deregulation.

A review of each sector will take place this year if the Tories remain in power, and Whitehall departments made to implement a ‘one in, two out’ rule whenever they introduce any new regulation.

His announcement came as Labour has been embroiled in a business row, after Ed Miliband turned on the boss of Boots when he expressed alarm at the prospect of the party regaining power.
