Rolf Harris has lost the first round of his appeal against conviction for a string of indecent assaults 

Disgraced entertainer Rolf Harris has lost the first round of his bid to appeal against his convictions for a string of indecent assaults.

Harris was jailed for five years and nine months for the sex abuse in July for attacks on children as young as eight between 1968 and 1986.

The Australian presenter and artist even abused his daughter Bindi's best friend while she slept feet away - but the 84-year-old has refused to show any remorse for his sex crimes.

This afternoon a spokesman for the Judicial Office confirmed  that a judge has refused his application for permission to appeal.

But it is still open to the 84-year-old to renew the application before three judges at the Court of Appeal.

The artist and musician was convicted of 12 indecent assaults at London's Southwark Crown Court on June 30.

One was on an eight-year-old autograph hunter, two on girls in their early teens, and a catalogue of abuse against his daughter's friend over 16 years. 

The appeal move was refused by a single judge considering the application on the case papers.

Harris, a family favourite for decades, was finally unmasked during his trial as a predator who was fixated with under-age girls.

Jurors were told that his 16-year campaign of sex abuse against his daughter's friend 'haunted' her and made her abandon her dreams as he continued to be adored by millions of fans worldwide.

His fall from grace was underlined as he was stripped of a Bafta fellowship and accolades in his native Australia were removed.

Passing sentence, Justice Sweeney said: 'You have shown no remorse for your crimes at all. Your reputation now lies in ruins, you have been stripped of your honours but you have no one to blame but yourself.'

New home: HMP Bullingdon in Oxfordshire is where Rolf Harris, 84, has been held for the majority of time so far, and reportedly spent a month creating the didgeridoo during art classes

Liz Dux, abuse lawyer at Slater & Gordon, who represents victims of Rolf Harris, said: 'The victims will be very relieved. They have already been through the horrific ordeal of a long and extremely stressful trial.

'They want this over so they can get on with their lives as best they can, although for some the damage Harris has done will sadly be irreparable.

'We must not forget the very serious nature of the crimes Harris committed. Justice has rightly been done and the victims will be pleased at the outcome.'

While in prison Harris has worked hard to endear himself to other inmates after a rocky start. 

In July it was claimed that Harris was spat at by an inmate during a prison church service, an incident which was said to have sparked a mass brawl.

He was also accused by a fellow prisoner of 'jumping the queue' into a paid gardening job in the grounds of the Oxfordshire jail.

Prison officers are said to be keeping a close eye on him to ensure he is not targeted. 

Since then he has been handing out signed drawings for free to inmates while at Bullingdon jail in Oxfordshire, until he was moved to HMP Stafford recently.

Last week it was reported he spent a month making a didgeridoo, which is about 3ft long and has been decorated on the outside with figures and images.

The artist, who famously painted a portrait of the Queen, also created a sculpture of interlocked chains out of wood to 'represent his time in jail'.

He has applied to have the instrument and sculpture transferred to his new cell on the vulnerable sex offenders wing  but is is thought guards have refused on the basis that inmates are not allowed to have large personal items.

He has also joined the prison church choir, which came as a shock to many after he previously shunned religion in his autobiography.

Harris' frail wife Alwen is understood to also regularly visit her husband in Bullingdon prison, arriving in a wheelchair.

She stood by Harris as he was unmasked as a paedophile who was fixated with underage girls during his trial at Southwark Crown Court.
