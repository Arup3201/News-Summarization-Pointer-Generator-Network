Born when Gladstone was Prime Minister, Thomas the tortoise has survived everything since 1882, even Nazi bombs.

But Thomas, now Britain’s oldest resident, hid a secret under its shell for most of those 130 years – being a female.

The tortoise was pulled from the rubble of a bomb-hit house in Essex in 1945. But it was only when owner June Le Gallez of Guernsey inherited Thomas in 1978 that a vet found the truth, after 96 years.

Identity crisis: Thomas is 130 years old and was only discovered to be a girl after 96 years

‘People suggested I rename him Tomasina,
but I thought it would be cruel to change it,’ said Mrs Le Gallez, 54, 
adding: ‘She isn’t slowing down. People can’t believe how active she 
is.’

Mrs Le Gallez, 54, who cares for the reptile at her home on the 
Channel Island of Guernsey, added: ‘Thomas is very much part of the 
family. I have pictures with her when I was as young as two.

'Because she is so old we thought we would have lost her by now but she is tough. I sometimes wonder if she will outlive me.

‘She’s always been very big for her age.

‘Thomas used to live and run in the garden when she was younger but now we keep her in the house and she bumbles around.

‘She is just a massive part of the family and everyone is very fond of her.

‘She really races around when she wants to. She’s really fast.’

Mrs Le Gallez inherited Thomas from her cousin Grace Hilditch in 1978.

Ms Hilditch had been given Thomas in 1922 as a present from her father Harry, who was friends with a reptile keeper at London Zoo.

Healthy diet: Could the secret to Thomas's long life be her love of bananas?

When they adopted Thomas the keeper informed Harry she was 40 years old putting her birth date at 1882.

Thomas lived happily with Ms Hilditch for 56 years at her home in Ilford, Essex, which was bombed in 1945 and a warden managed to rescue her from the rubble.

She was given to Mrs Le Gallez and husband Richard after Ms Hilditch had fallen ill and later died.

June said: ‘The journey from Essex to Guernsey with Thomas was a rather funny one.

‘Staff on the train asked me if I wanted anything to eat and drink and if Thomas wanted any lettuce leaves.’

Thomas is kept company in the garden by fellow tortoises Gorky and Carstaias, who are both 50 years old, and her favourite food is bananas.

The oldest recorded tortoise in Britain was Timmy, a Mediterranean spur-thighed tortoise who was believed to be 160 years old when she died in 2004 at Powderham Castle, Devon.

David Alderton, Editor of Practical Reptile Keeping magazine said: ‘Although many people have contacted us about tortoises over 50 years old, some of which they’ve had since childhood, we’ve only heard to date of two individuals who are more than 100 years old.’
