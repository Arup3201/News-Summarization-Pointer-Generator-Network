Angry: Victoria Hislop blasted the terms 'chick-lit' and 'women's fiction' for needlessly categorising texts

It has become one of the publishing world’s most popular genres.

But don’t label Victoria Hislop’s books as ‘chick lit’ - it makes her ‘really angry’.

The author, 54, also criticised the use of the label “women’s fiction” by publishers - and said having fiction prizes for women was ‘an anachronism’.

She said women are ‘proving themselves as writers’ and there it was no longer necessary to have a ‘special place’ to celebrate their efforts.

‘There isn’t a need,’ she said. ‘Maybe it’s going too much the other way, maybe there should be men’s prize.’

She said the label “women’s fiction” was championed by marketing teams at publishing houses but that she disagreed with her work being put into that category.

‘I don’t see myself like that,’ she said. ‘My books are full of civil wars and disease and people dying - it’s not really “women’s fiction”.’

Mrs Hislop, who is married to Private Eye editor Ian Hislop, said she believed the term came ‘partly from a desire to somehow make bookshops more manageable’.

‘We have crime, we have erotica - there’s always a desire to split and categorise and give titles. But “women’s” is 50 per cent of us.... We don’t have “men’s” fiction,’ she said.

Speaking to an audience at the Cheltenham Literature Festival, she said: ‘I personally really get angry when somebody describes my work as “chicklit”.

‘It can be very annoying for a writer to be described as something when they just want to be a writer.’

She blamed publishers’ marketing departments for spreading the term.

‘We don’t really have control at the marketing end of things. As writers we don’t necessarily have a choice,’ she said. ‘It’s the people who want to sell our books.’

But she added she did not imagine the situation changing in the future.

‘I don’t think women are going to rise up and say “take our names off the cover, we don't want to be seen as women”,’ she said.

Mrs Hislop also explained that she did not consider audience when she sat down to write a novel.

‘When I’m writing I don’t think I’m writing for women at all, I don’t think about who I’m writing for.

‘I think it’s something that happens a little bit down the line.’

She revealed her literary heroine was Emily Bronte, the author of Wuthering Heights, because she treated ‘place as a character’.

But she added: ‘The writers I would love to write like but wouldn’t dream of emulating are men.’

She listed Ian McEwen, Julian Barnes and Spanish author Javier Marias as her favourites.

She appeared at the festival alongside author Penelope Lively, who agreed ‘it was not essential’ to have special prizes and categories for women writers.

One of Miss Lively’s works features in Mrs Hislop’s new collection of 100 short stories by women, The Story. The collection focuses on ‘love, loss and lives of women’.

Mrs Hislop said she preferred short stories written by women because they ‘go straight to the heart of emotion more easily’.

But she added her decision to compile the collection was ‘partly pragmatic’ and she hoped a collection of men’s short stories would follow.

'When I'm writing I don't think I'm writing for women at all, I don't think about who I'm writing for,' she said

She added: ‘There’s no doubt women and men write differently. I don’t think either necessarily write better, but they do write differently.’

Mrs Hislop added it had ‘never even crossed her mind’ to include her own work in the collection.

She is best known for her bestselling first novel, The Island, which is set in Crete.

The book sold over a million copies and was the Richard and Judy Summer Read 2006.

Mrs Hislop worked in publishing and journalism before becoming an author.

She has two children with husband Ian, who is a panellist on the long-running BBC show Have I Got News For You.

Mr Hislop was in the audience at the festival to support his wife.
