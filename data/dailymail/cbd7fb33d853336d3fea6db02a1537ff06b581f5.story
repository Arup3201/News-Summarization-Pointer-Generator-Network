British troops serving in Afghanistan were given a taste of home when they celebrated Christmas with a traditional turkey dinner, presents from relatives and a charity fun run.

An extra effort was made today to make sure the 9,000 servicemen and women deployed in the Helmand Province were given some 'down time' as staff at the Laskah Gah Main Operating Base opened Secret Santa presents along with gifts from family.

Medics were given home comforts including new socks, underwear and toiletries as Christmas favourites such as Chris Rea's Driving Home For Christmas and the Pogues' Fairytale Of New York played in the background.

Meanwhile, soldiers and service members with the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) also enjoyed a Christmas dinner and attended a mass to mark the day.

Many wore pyjamas and all-in-one sleepsuits, while eating toasted bacon bagels for breakfast.

Private Amy Louise Johnson, 23, from Newcastle upon Tyne, who serves with the 3 Medical Regiment, said: 'Before I left, I thought I would be sad and missing all my family around the table, but we are such a team here that it's like having your family here with you and you're all in it together.

'I think it's just part of being a soldier - getting on with it.'

Soldiers from the 1st Battalion, The Duke of Lancaster's Regiment held their own celebrations with cups of tea, festive hats and Christmas jumpers.

Commanding officer Lieutenant Colonel Nick Wood addressed the troops to thank them for their hard work on the tour so far, and wished everybody a merry Christmas.

In Lashkar Gah, hundreds of soldiers and spectators gathered in costumes for the Lash Dash, a 5K fun run for charity.

Thousands of balloons, crackers, party poppers and hats were flown in to the areas of operations specially, and more than 130 tonnes of Christmas post was delivered to Camp Bastion this week, to be handed out among bases.

It was business as usual for many troops on the front line, as members of the Royal Military Police and the Royal Dragoon Guards set off on an early morning patrol.

The group of about 20 soldiers went out on foot patrol to visit Afghan National Police officers, a practice they have been carrying out daily.

Celebrations and lunches were laid on at bases across Helmand, including Camp Bastion and Forward Operating Base Shawqat, as well as Camp Tombstone and Main Operating Base Price, where the Royal Scots Borderers, 1st Battalion, The Royal Regiment of Scotland, are operating.

Every soldier serving in Afghanistan received a Christmas lunch or dinner, even those in remote patrol bases, as Army chefs travelled around to serve them freshly-cooked meals.

A Christmas pantomime, loosely based on Aladdin, was put on by troops at the base in Lashkar Gah, spoof-starring 'Cheryl Cole' and 'Ross Kemp'.
