Charged: Jailene Diaz-Ramos, 19, was carrying the Smith & Wesson revolver in her car when she crash in June

Police have found the handgun used in a 2012 double murder that has been linked to NFL star Aaron Hernandez, it was revealed today.

The .38-caliber Smith & Wesson revolver was found in a black case in the trunk of a 19-year-old woman's car after she crashed near Springfield, Massachusetts, in June.

The Massachusetts State Police sent the weapon in for ballistics testing and learned that it fired the rounds that killed Daniel Jorge Correia de Abreu, 29, and Safiro Teixeira Furtado, 28, outside a Boston night club in July 2012.Â 

WSHM-TV reports that the woman, Jailene Diaz-Ramos, from Hernandez's hometown of Bristol, Connecticut, said the gun belonged to a friend she would only name as 'Chicago.' She said she was giving her friends - who were football players - a ride to work and that they must have left it in her car.

Police began investigating Hernandez's involvement in that case after he was arrested in June and charged with the murder of 27-year-old semi-pro football player Odin Lloyd.

Investigators are still frantically searching for the .45-caliber Glock semi-automatic pistol used in that murder.

Hernandez, 23, was a star tight end for the New England Patriots before the team dropped him when he was charged with murder. Last year, he signed a four-year, $40million contract with the Patriots.

Hernendez, 23, is currently in jail awaiting trial on charges he murdered Odin Lloyd, a semi-pro football player, in June. He has not been charged in connection with the 2012 slaying

Unsolved: Police are reportedly investigating Hernandez's connection to the 2012 murder of two immigrants from Cape Verde after an altercation outside a Boston nightclub

The 2012 slayings of Correia de Abreu and Furtado, both immigrants from Cape Verde, occurred outside a Boston night club after Hernandez and his entourage had an altercation with the men, WSHM reports.

An SUV with Rhode Island license plates was seen driving past the victims' BMW. Someone inside the SUV fired multiple rounds into the car and then sped off.

Police later recovered that SUV at Hernandez's uncle's house in Bristol. It was registered to Hernandez, according to WSHM.

Hernandez has not been charged in those killings, though prosecutors have convened a grand jury to investigate whether there exists enough evidence to file charges in the case.

The gun found is a .38-caliber Smith & Wesson revolver, similar to this one

The former NFL star is currently in jail facing charges that he murdered Odin Lloyd, a 27-year-old semi-pro football player who was dating the sister of Hernandez's fiance.

Hernandez has pleaded not guilty and has hired two high-powered criminal defense lawyers to defend the case.

The gun was found on June 21 after Diaz-Ramos was involved in a crash on the interstate outside Springfield. She was taken to the hospital and treated for mild injuries.

When state police inventories her wrecked car, they found the handgun in the truck in a case with three rounds of ammunition.

Police also found a locked safe, though they are still awaiting a search warrant to open it.

Diaz-Ramos was arrested and charged with weapons possession.

Diaz-Ramos wouldn't say who owned the gun, only that it belonged to a man called 'Chicago'
