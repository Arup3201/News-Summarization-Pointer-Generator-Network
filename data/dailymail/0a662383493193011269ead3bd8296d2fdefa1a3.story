Armand De Saint-Salvy's 30-second video, titled Manchild, has been selected as one of the finalists in Doritos' Crash the Super Bowl ad competition

An Australian man's hilarious advertisement has secured a position as one of the top 10 world finalists in a competition that could see him pocket $1 million and have his work aired at the US Super Bowl. 

Armand De Saint-Salvy's 30-second video, titled Manchild, was selected by Doritos from almost 5,000 entries as a front-runner in their Crash the Super Bowl ad competition.

The Sydney based freelancer and director from Bondi told Daily Mail Australia that it was his own behaviour and 'the universal truth of the man-child' that inspired the theme of his advertisement.

'It's based on myself – I can be quite immature. I get pumped about the game, I get excited to go out with the boys, I yell at the telly when the referee makes a call; I'm a child sometimes,' Mr De Saint-Salvy said.

Excitement first hit the talented filmmaker when he was informed of his finalist position by Hunger Games actress Elizabeth Banks, one of the judges of the competition.

'I got a phone call early in the morning that woke me up and I answered all groggy and half asleep, and I hear: "Hi, I'm Elizabeth Banks. I'm a Hollywood actress do you know who I am?",' Mr De Saint-Salvy said.

Excitement first hit the talented filmmaker when he was informed of his finalist position by Hunger Games actress Elizabeth Banks, one of the judges of the competition, who personally called him 

'I was like: "Of course I know who you are! Oh my god is this about Doritos?" and she said yes.' The 36-year-old was sworn to secrecy for the next three weeks and was flown to the US where he received media training for the massive event.

Two finalist, one selected by online votes and the other by Doritos, will have their ads aired at the Super Bowl – an event which scored the title of most watched program in US television history in February last year.

The finalist selected by the chips company will win the grand prize of $1 million and year-long contract to work at Universal Pictures in Hollywood.

For Mr De Saint-Salvy, it's the opportunity of a career in Hollywood that has his hopes pinned on the prize. He said that so far, even the world-wide recognition for his work and the work of his actors, Lydia Sarks and Mitch Wright, was exciting.

'A massive, priceless opportunity': The competition's finalist will win the grand prize of $1 million and year-long contract to work at Universal Pictures in Hollywood

'The deal with Universal Pictures is worth more than the million dollars for someone like me,'Mr De Saint-Salvy said

'The deal with Universal Pictures is worth more than the million dollars for someone like me,' he said.

'To break into Hollywood is extremely difficult; to pitch your ideas and have them talk about what projects they think would be best suited to you would be a massive, priceless opportunity.'

But it was a close call for the 36-year-old, who admitted that he filmed and edited his submission within 24 hours of the submission date.

'What happened was I made another commercial for the competition, submitted it and though it was excellent and then someone told me "I don't think it's going to do well",' he said.

The talented 36-year-old admitted that he filmed and edited his submission within 24 hours of the submission date after being unsatisfied with his earlier submission 

'So the day before entries closed, I went back to my list of 80 ideas and Manchild was one I had really liked but didn't have a proper script for. I re-edited it on Thursday night, found actors on Friday, found the location on Saturday, shot it on Sunday, edited it on Sunday night and had it delivered Monday.'

When asked how he would recommend budding filmmakers get their idea's noticed, Mr De Saint-Salvy advised: 'you have to be very perseverant and don't wait for opportunities, just try to make thing as much as you can.'

'I've learnt over time that you never stop learning as a filmmaker – if you're humble and work hard and put yourself out there, you'll get somewhere.'
