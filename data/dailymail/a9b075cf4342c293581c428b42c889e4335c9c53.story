A pair of thieves were caught on CCTV stripping computer screens from a train station after one was dressed in a bright red polka dot onesie and the other in a pair of distinctive purple leggings.

British Transport police are now hunting for the men after the string of monitor screen thefts which took place earlier this month at Dewsbury train station in West Yorkshire.

Officers have now released the CCTV images of the pair in their outlandish outfits in a bid to track them down.

The men dressed in a red polka dot onesie and another in purple leggings, who police are hunting after a spate of monitor thefts from Dewsbury train station 

One images shows the man in the onesie walking ahead of another man, who is wearing the bright leggings, while carrying a spade.

The expensive monitors can't be used as TVs but can be hooked up to a computer or games system.

In total three of the screens were stolen from the station on three separate evenings earlier this month.

PC Marcus Robinson said: 'We are releasing their images in that hope that, despite their faces being covered, someone may recognise their distinctive dress.

'One of the men is wearing a red polka dot onesie, the other appears to be wearing purple leggings and carrying a spade.

'CCTV at the station captured the two people pictured on Monday, 6 October just after 10.50pm when the third screen was stolen.

The pair were spotted on CCTV wearing the distinctive outfits earlier this month, on the same night one of the screens was taken 

'We believe they may be able to assist our enquiries into this incident and are investigating whether they are linked to the other two thefts.'

Police believe that when the monitors were stolen, the security surround on the screens was forced off before they were taken.

PC Robinson added: 'The screens, which are expensive and will now have to be replaced, are used to provide up to date travel information to passengers at the station and usually only operate in a commercial environment.

'First TransPennine Express, who manage the station, have now increased security measures on other screens at their stations to make them more difficult to steal.

'If you recognise them, have been offered one of the screens, or have any information that could help our investigation, please contact us.'

Anyone with information should contact British Transport Police on 0800 40 50 40.
