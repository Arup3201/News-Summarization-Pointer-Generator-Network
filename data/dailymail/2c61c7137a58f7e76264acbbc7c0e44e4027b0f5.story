A mother-of-three whose sex life was ruined after a negligent delay in spinal surgery has won £2.4million in damages from the NHS.

Heather Tait was in tears yesterday when the award was announced at London’s High Court.

The 34-year-old photographer had told an earlier hearing in Birmingham that her ‘passionate’ sex life with her husband Russel had been ruined by the complications she continues to suffer from.

Judge Martin McKenna, who made the award, said Mrs Tait had told doctors that she ‘now feels that to a degree there is no point in having intercourse’.

She also felt her closeness with her husband had been ‘jeopardised’ by her lack of enjoyment in sex.

Mrs Tait, of Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands, said as she left court: ‘I’m pleased that it is finally over.’

She was the boss of her own company and winning respect as a professional photographer before she went into Cheltenham General Hospital in July 2009, suffering from severe back pain. 

Judge McKenna – who only had to decide the amount of damages after a judgment was entered for Mrs Tait against the Gloucestershire Hospitals NHS Trust in 2012 – said although it was suspected she had a prolapsed disc, she was sent home without an MRI scan.

By the next day, Mrs Tait’s condition had deteriorated. She returned to hospital and a scan revealed a massive prolapsed disc. 

She had emergency spinal surgery at Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham on July 8, 2009.

Judge McKenna said the trust had admitted if she had had the scan and surgery earlier, she would not have developed the severe injuries she now suffers from.

Mrs Tait has been left doubly incontinent and ‘has suffered a loss of sexual sensation and some psychiatric damage’, the judge said. 

Cauda equina syndrome is a serious condition where the nerves at the very bottom of the spinal cord become compressed. 

Symptoms include:

Doctors advise seeking medical assistance immediately if a person develops these symptoms.

They should visit their GP or the accident and emergency (A&E) department of the nearest hospital.

If cauda equina syndrome is not promptly treated, the nerves to the bladder and bowel can become permanently damaged.

She continues to suffer from back pain. As well as helping her husband to run a conferencing organising business – Crystal Clear Productions (CCP) – Mrs Tait ran her own photography business, Heather Tait Photography.

Judge McKenna said she was not a person who would exaggerate her symptoms for profit.

‘She is a high achiever who has worked extremely hard throughout her life,’ he said.

‘She left school at 17 with ten GCSEs to pursue a career in theatre lighting and media, and she is, plainly, a capable, driven and ambitious woman with proven business skills, and a talented photographer who has been the driving force behind the success of CCP.’

He said that despite the effect of the delayed surgery, Mrs Tait had tried to continue her photographic business and complete the first year of a Masters degree at Birmingham City University.

‘To my mind these are not the character traits or indeed the actions of a malingerer or someone who is out to exaggerate her claim for financial gain,’ he said.

Judge McKenna awarded Mrs Tait £140,000 for her pain and suffering and loss of amenity, with the balance made up of past and future care and loss of earnings.

As well as paying £2.4million in damages, the trust must also pay legal costs estimated at £1.2million.

The trust’s counsel, Robert Seabrook QC, said ‘continuous efforts’ were made to improve procedures and standards at its hospitals.

He also expressed the trust’s ‘deep sympathy’ to Mrs Tait for the ‘terrible injuries she has suffered’.

Mrs Tait said as she left court: 'I'm pleased that it is finally over.'
