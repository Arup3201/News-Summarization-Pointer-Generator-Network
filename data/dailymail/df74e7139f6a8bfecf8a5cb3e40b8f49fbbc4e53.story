Michael Gove proposed new taxes on the 'undeserving rich' last night, saying the Tories will only win the general election if voters believe the party are 'warriors for the dispossessed'.

Painting a broad, positive vision for five more years in power, the party's chief whip said the wealthiest already pay the most towards reducing the deficit, but insisted: 'We expect them to pay more.'

Official figures show that despite the economic crisis, inequality has fallen since 2010 – an achievement he said the Conservatives should trumpet rather than 'overlook'. 

Tough stance: Chief Whip Michael Gove (pictured) proposed new taxes on the 'undeserving rich' last night, saying the Tories will only win the the election if voters believe the party are 'warriors for the dispossessed'

He added: 'The reductions in public expenditure have been accompanied by tax reform to ensure the undeserving rich pay more.'

In a speech in London at the launch of modernising Tory campaign group The Good Right, he said that making it easier for families to buy their own homes is a 'quintessentially progressive cause' and central to the Tory campaign.

That will be seen as a strong hint that the party's manifesto will include extensions to the Right to Buy programme started by Margaret Thatcher and the Help to Buy scheme introduced by George Osborne. Mr Gove also hailed the Government's reforms to welfare, education and pensions.

He claimed that Labour would stop social progress in its tracks if returned to power in May – propped up by Scottish Nationalists – who are 'even less progressive than Labour'.

Mr Gove insisted his intervention was not meant as a swipe at the election campaign masterminded by chief strategist Lynton Crosby. But it will be seen as backing for those who have been calling for a more upbeat tone to the campaign.

Senior Tories, including Home Secretary Theresa May, have in recent weeks called for a more encouraging pitch, focused on the party's achievements in office and compassionate vision for the future.

The Chancellor is expected to use next week's Budget to underline the Tories' pledge to lift the threshold for basic rate tax to £12,500, freeing more of the lower-paid from tax, and to lift the 40p bracket to £50,000, helping the middle classes. 

Mr Gove's speech repeatedly referred to 'compassionate Conservatism'.

He said: 'Only if we remind people of our commitment to social justice, demonstrate our belief in equality of opportunity and affirm that we are warriors for the dispossessed, will we be able to win arguments and elections, and then be in a position genuinely to help the vulnerable and the voiceless.'

The Government's greatest achievement has been 'getting Britain back to work', he said, adding: 'In the last five years, Britain has created more jobs than the whole of the rest of the European Union put together.'

Britain's global export trade is booming – giving George Osborne a pre-Budget boost.

The latest Office for National Statistics data shows the trade deficit – the difference between imports and what the UK sells to foreign markets – dropped to just £600million in January, from a high of £2.1billion in December.

Exports, which were hit by stagnation in the eurozone, rose by 5.8 per cent in the three months to January, while imports rose by just 2 per cent. Britain's improved performance was helped by lower global oil prices, which have been responsible for the low rate of inflation, currently running at just 0.3 per cent.
