Tour.

Below is a list of the top eight payouts from the European Poker Tour: 

Following
 her second win, she said she felt 'a sense of vague bafflement and joy'
 - adding that she hoped her success would inspire millions of other 
Britons to play poker.

'The big thing for me is trying to 
fly the flag for people who are playing poker primarily for fun and have
 another job. I want those people to feel they have a chance at 
winning,' she told the newspaper.

'It's an incredibly inclusive game, 
for men and women, for old or young.

'I want women to feel encouraged
 and not be put off but the bigger thing is everyone should feel very 
welcome.'

Coren Mitchell, who describes poker as a 'strange game' in which competitors are both enemies and friends, celebrated her success with her husband in their hotel room by ordering room service. 

Launched by PokerStars 10 years ago, the 
European Poker Tour is now a major event in the international poker 
calendar alongside the World Series of Poker and the World Poker Tour.
