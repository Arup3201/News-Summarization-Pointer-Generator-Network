For years, ramblers had treasured the wildflower meadows as the perfect spot for a walk.

The 29-acre site was also popular with joggers, dog walkers and schools’ nature studies lessons.

But now the idyll has been shattered after the new landowner put up a 6ft-high 300ft-long spiked steel fence enclosing the footpath to keep walkers – and dogs – off his land.

The owner of a meadow in Frome, Somerset, erected this 300ft-long fence around a pathway after wildlife campaigners asked him to keep the unofficial walkway clear

Before the fence was erected, campaigners attempted to block Mr Brunt's purchase of the land amid fears development of the area would damage the landscape

Campaigners had tried to block haulage boss Alan Brunt’s attempt to buy Rodden Lake Stream Meadows in Frome, Somerset, amid fears that development would damage the landscape.

But after successfully buying the land for £210,000, Mr Brunt has put up the fence which locals say makes walkers feel like they are in a top security prison.

Ecologist Sue Everett said: ‘Anyone thinking they will enjoy a nice country walk along the public footpath is now hemmed in by a horrific steel palisade fence.’

Ruth Knaggs, a member of the action 
group, said: 'We went to Mr Brunt to ask him if maybe there was 
something we could do to still access the field but he refused.

'The path is used as a nice green walking route, that’s all we wanted.

'He said he wanted to use it for hay growing and obviously dogs mess is not good for that at all.

'We did suggest that we could campaign for awareness to stop people doing that but he just wasn’t having it.

But Mr Brunt bought the land after Mendip District Council rejected a bid to protect the area by action group Save Open Spaces. The group attempted to register the land as a community asset, which also failed

'He put a fence in at the cut through to town before Christmas, that was the first stand he took.'

The community projects manager at Frome Town Council added: 'Now he’s put a fence around the only footpath we are allowed to use.

'It is the sort of fence you put around some kind of industrial site that you are worried about vandals attacking.

'It is completely over the top, it is really shocking.'

When the fields were put up for sale last September following the death of the owner, some residents began a campaign to raise funds to buy and preserve the land.

They tried to block the sale by registering the site as a community asset.

After the group approached Mr Brunt asking for him to keep the walkway clear, he erected the fence - insisting walkers stick to the designated path

When they approached Mr Brunt, who is also a farmer, to keep a well-used unofficial short cut across the field towards the town centre, he refused.

Mrs Knaggs said he fenced off the short cut before turning his attention to the official footpath.

Yesterday Mr Brunt, 64, said he had built the fence to protect his livestock from the risk of disease posed by dog mess – and to protect dogs and walkers from his cattle.

Councillor Pippa Goldfinger today said the new fencing would not look out of place 'in a high security prison'

He said: 'What other option did I have? If I'd have used a barbed wire fence people would have complained that their dogs and children were getting caught and the cattle wouldn't have liked it much either.

'Yes it probably doesn't look that nice at the moment but it will dim down over time. I had to put it there for agricultural purposes, that was all I was doing.

'The dogs mess was ridiculous and it had to be controlled otherwise it would have harmed my cattle.

'The dog mess creates germs which get into cattle and abort the calves, I don't want that happening.

'I need to get the land clean for six months at least before the disease goes out the land and before I can graze cattle so it needs to happen sooner rather than later.

'I went to the footpath people and asked if I could put a fence up and they said it was my right so, so I did.

'I did it so it is safe for both parties, people can walk through safely, dogs can walk through next to the cattle safely, I've seen lots of instances where cattle have chased dogs.

'It's avoiding injury, it's health and safety.'

He built the 6ft fence because barbed wire would have been a danger. ‘It probably doesn’t look that nice at the moment but it will dim down over time,’ he added.

One neighbour, Brian Dredge, 72, welcomed the fence.

The community projects manager at Frome Town Council said of the fence: 'It is completely over the top, it is really shocking'

‘We were getting three dog-walking agencies parking on our road so they could use the field,’ he said.

‘From about 6am there were about 15 to 20 cars a day with barking dogs, slamming doors and shouting to each other.

‘And the dog mess was unbelievable. Sometimes it would be so bad we couldn’t even sit in the garden because of the smell.’

But one local said Mr Brunt was a saint for putting up the fence - as noisy dog walkers were making his life hell by letting their animals mess around his home

'Mr Brunt is in my opinion a saint, and I speak for everyone who lives on the road.

'Since the fence has gone up we haven't had any cars parking on the street, the volume of people have gone from our road, the dogs mess has gone, the noise at 6am has gone.

'It's great. Everyone you speak to now is like, "it's quiet isn't it?"

'All the people complaining about the beautiful meadow being ruined are wrong, in my opinion it was not beautiful at all, it was a nasty, smelly dogs park.'

Mr Dredge added that Mr Brunt had left wire up for a small section of the foothpath but within days the wire was broken so people could get into the field once more.
