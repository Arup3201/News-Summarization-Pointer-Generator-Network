A crane driver has told how helicopters often flew within a few feet of a London crane just weeks before it was struck by a chopper last week.

The driver, who didn't wish to be named, even captured an image of an army Chinook helicopter flying close to the crane on The Tower at St George Wharf, Vauxhall, just a month before the tragic crash.

Pilot Pete Barnes, 50, died from multiple injuries when the helicopter he was flying hit the high-rise crane and crashed down into Wandsworth Road at around 8am last Wednesday.

The pictures taken by the crane driver in December have now emerged on the same day an Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) report reveals Mr Barnes was twice urged not to fly because of the poor weather conditions on the day he died.

Fears: The crane driver, who did not want to be named, said he was worried about an aircraft hitting the crane before the crash happened

View from the sky: This crane driver claimed to even be able to see the eyes of pilots they flew so close

The
 crane driver claimed he had been worried a helicopter would hit the high-rise structure months before the accident occurred.

He said he could almost see the eyes of some pilots as they 
came so close to the crane above the River Thames.

He added: 'It was very close. It was difficult to tell
 how close they were but you could almost see the whites of the pilot’s 
eyes.'

'When the first one came by I had no idea what it was. There was the sudden loud noise and it whipped right passed the cab.

'They
 came by pretty frequently and it was a bit worrying. It made you jump 
and it was certainly close enough that you worried the crane could be 
hit.'

Warning: Pilot Pete Barnes decided to fly his plane despite the bad weather even if it meant ' landing in a field'

Mr Barnes had 
been scheduled to fly from Redhill, Surrey, to collect restaurant and 
clubs tycoon Richard Caring from Elstree, Hertfordshire, on January 16.

A
 report by the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) revealed that 
Ivy owner Mr Caring suggested the journey be postponed because of poor 
visibility.

But father-of-two Mr Barnes responded that he was 'coming anyway' and would 'land in a field' if necessary.

The
 pilots comments were made just half an hour before he was diverted to 
Battersea heliport due to the bad weather and clipped the high-rise 
crane.

The AAIB released today revealed the details of that morning's conversations between the pilot and his client.

‘At
 0718hrs, the client called the pilot to discuss the weather. The pilot 
said he thought the weather might clear earlier than forecast. The 
client said he would drive to Elstree and call the pilot to keep him 
advised.

‘At 0731hrs, 
having noticed how poor the weather was during his journey, the client 
called the pilot to suggest that he did not take off until he (the 
client) had reached Elstree and observed the weather. The pilot replied 
that he was already starting the engines.

‘The client stated that he repeated his suggestion that the pilot should not take off,' the report said.

Details
 of text messages sent and received by the pilot have also been 
revealed.

At 6.30am he told the client: 'Weather OK up north but 
freezing fog at Elstree and Luton not clearing between 8-10am I've got 
same at Redhill keep you posted.’

He sent the client another message at 7.29am which stated: ‘I'm coming anyway will land in a field if I have to.’

Another
 pilot, who was aware of the journey planned by Mr Barnes, sent him a 
message which read: ‘Give me a call as I have checked weather and 
freezing fog around at the moment.'

Mr
 Barnes was on his way to collect his client when he was forced to 
change his route because of the bad weather. His final conversation was 
with air traffic control seven seconds before the crash.

Mr Barnes requested to land at London Heliport in Battersea. He asked: ‘Is Battersea open, do you know?’

After being told the heliport was open, he replied: ‘If I could head to Battersea that would be very useful.’

Just
 15 seconds before hitting the crane, air traffic control told the 
pilot: ‘Battersea diversion approved, you're cleared to Battersea.’ His final words were: ‘Thanks a lot.’

The
 AAIB report stated: ‘This exchange ended at 0759.18 when G-CRST (the 
helicopter) was approximately 150 metres south-west of Vauxhall Bridge.

Victim Matt Wood, who was described by his sister Amanda as a 'big guy with a big heart'. His inquest is yet to take place

'Immediately
 afterwards the helicopter began to turn right. At 0759.25 it struck a 
crane on the south side of the river 275 metres from the south-west end 
of Vauxhall Bridge.’

The initial ‘special bulletin’ report by the AAIB also suggested that the solar-powered red warning lights on top of the crane were not switched on during the crash because the official requirement was that ‘the obstacle be lit at night only.’

It notes: ‘The crane was lit at night with red lights, both on its tower and jib.’

‘The tower lighting consisted of mains powered steady red lights at approximately 50m intervals.

‘The jib lighting was provided by solar powered lights.

‘The Air Navigation Order requires the lighting to be of  medium intensity (2000 candela) and that the obstacles be lit at night only.’

But an official ‘notice to airmen’ warning had been issued about the structure.

Mr
 Barnes, a father of two from Berkshire, had 25 years' flying 
experience.

He had flown as an air ambulance pilot and in several films 
during his career including Oscar-winning Saving Private Ryan and Tomb 
Raider II.

Pedestrian Mr Wood, from Sutton, Surrey, died from severe burns and a leg injury.

A spokesman for the MoD confirmed that the Chinook pictured is an army aircraft but added it posed no risk to cranes and was flying a perfectly safe and approved London air route.

He said: 'There are air lanes which run through central London which the RAF does use and will continue to use.

'There are no cranes allowed within in this space and aircrafts using these routes pose no risk to crane drivers.'

Around 3,500 aircraft fly through London airspace alone every day with the UK seeing 2.2million flights around the country every year.
