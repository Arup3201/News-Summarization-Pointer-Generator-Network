Excessive: A children's book that Helen Hamer had ordered online arrived in a huge box and wrapped in 30 feet of brown paper

It appears as though someone was being a little too diligent when they wrapped up this Christmas gift.

A children’s book that Helen Hamer had ordered online arrived in a huge box and wrapped in 30 feet of brown paper.

The mother of three bought Christopher Wormell’s Animal Train from Amazon at the beginning of December. Five days later, the paperback arrived at her local sorting office – but despite being only millimetres thick, it came in a deep box.

And there was so much brown paper wrapped around it, Miss Hamer, a 43-year-old writer from north London, thought it was a prank.

She said: ‘I picked up the parcel from 
my local sorting office and was really surprised when I saw the size of 
the package as I couldn¹t remember buying anything that big.

‘The man in the sorting office actually joked that he didn’t think there was anything inside as it was so light.

'I’d unravelled 30 feet of packaging paper before I got to the one book I’d ordered.

'It’s bad for the environment to be using all of this extra packaging – and it also costs Amazon more money.’

Helen Bingham, spokesperson for Waste 
Watch, urged customers to send packaging back to retailers to ‘make them
think’ about the waste they generate.

She said: ‘This is really not 
good, either environmentally as much of this waste goes into landfill 
sites or financially as it costs a lot to send out these packages.

‘The
only things we can do is urge people to send this wrapping back and 
make the retailers really think about what they are doing and also play a
part ourselves  we can recycle as much as possible.’

In 2008, following complaints, Amazon signed up to the Frustration Free Packaging initiative under which it pledged to cut back on excess wrapping.

Amazon advised Miss Hamer to click on its packaging feedback page.

A spokesman said: ‘Our aim is to ensure that customers receive products in perfect condition whilst using the least amount of packaging possible.’

Three years ago, this newspaper began campaigning to make retailers take responsibility for the packaging they generate.

Our
‘Banish the bags’ campaign aims to cut down on the amount of plastic 
finding its way into the sea, where it can damage the animals and birds.
