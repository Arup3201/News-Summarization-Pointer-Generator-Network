Borussia Dortmund frontman Marco Reus believes Bayern Munich will dominate Europe and the Bundesliga once again this season.

The Germany international has insisted Jurgen Klopp's men - who finished second, 19 points behind the Bavarians last term - must be more consistent if they are to keep up with Bayern during the upcoming campaign.

Speaking to German sports magazine Kicker, Reus said: 'It will be all about Bayern Munich again in the Bundesliga, even if they weren't crowned champions in 2007 and 2011 the season after a World Cup.

Hopeful: Reus insists Dortmund will have to be more consistent next term in order to keep up with Bayern

'As for Dortmund, we will have to ensure we don't drop as many points again as we did halfway through last season.

'We did very well at the start of the campaign and toward the end, but were not at the same level halfway through the season.'

Pep Guardiola's side are currently in America and trained in Portland on Thursday ahead of their clash with the MLS All Stars on Sunday.

Bayern are strong favourites for this season's Bundesliga title after losing just two league games last season and having strengthened their first-team with the acquisition of Dortmund striker Robert Lewandowski.

While Polish frontman Lewandowski may have left Signal Iduna Park for the Allianz Arena, Reus has insisted he is happy at Dortmund amid speculation over his future.

'I can only repeat what I have already said before. I am very happy to be playing for Dortmund,' said the 25-year-old who missed Gerrmay's World Cup triumph with an ankle injury.

'My main objective for now is to get back to peak fitness. Everything else isn't important for me at the moment.'
