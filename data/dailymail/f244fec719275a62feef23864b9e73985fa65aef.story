An Air Canada flight from London to Toronto was forced to make an unscheduled landing after a female passenger assaulted two flight attendants, say police.

The Montreal-based airline confirmed that he Airbus A330 touched down at Halifax Stanfield International Airport, north of Halifax, Nova Scotia, on Wednesday afternoon due to an ‘unruly passenger’.

Flight 869 was just a few hours from its destination when the flight crew reported the alleged assault while in Canadian airspace and requested permission to divert.

The plane was flying north of Prince Edward Island when it diverted to Halifax, Nova Scotia 

After the plane landed Royal Canadian Mounted Police officers boarded the aircraft and arrested a 30-year-old woman from South Africa, said Sgt Alain LeBlanc.

He said: ‘The preliminary investigation indicates that a female passenger allegedly assaulted two flight attendants during the flight.

‘The woman was arrested and is in police custody. The investigation is ongoing.’

The plane’s 239 passengers spent about three hours in Halifax before the plane departed for Toronto.

There have been several high-profile incidents this month involving unruly travellers.

Also on Wednesday, two female passengers had to be separated after they brawled over their seating arrangements on a flight from Chongqing, China to Hong Kong.

A Thai AirAsia flight attendant was splashed with a cup of hot water and noodles on a flight last week 

Last week, a female passenger who was upset because she wasn’t seated next to her boyfriend threw a cup of hot water and noodles into the face of a flight attendant on a Thai AirAsia flight from Bangkok to Nanjing, China.

During the chaotic scene a man believed to be the Chinese woman’s boyfriend threatened to blow up the plane.

The plane returned to Bangkok, where the unruly passengers were kicked off the aircraft and ordered to pay compensation to the injured flight attendant.
