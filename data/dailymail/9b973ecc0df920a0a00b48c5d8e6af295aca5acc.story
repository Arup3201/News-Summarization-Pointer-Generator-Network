A TV show contributor on Good Morning America was so scared of losing her job if she didn’t lose weight that she shed 72 pounds in one year.

Entrepreneur and author, Tory Johnson, 43, has recently published a book, The Shift, about her quest to lose weight.

She admits if she had not gone on a diet and lost weight, she would probably not be a contributor still on Good Morning America.

The moment that made her realise it 
was a matter of ‘lose weight or lose your job’ was when she had her 
first one-on-one meeting with ABC News’ highest-ranking woman, Barbara 
Fedida.

On that December morning in 2011, Johnson dressed herself in all black, hoping it would make her look slimmer for the meeting.

The
two met at the ABC cafeteria where they talked about everything from 
their kids and New York City public schools, to their husbands and the 
‘GMA’ ratings.

But then the conversation changed, according to a personal column Johnson wrote in the New York Post.

‘You don’t look as good as you could,’ Fedida told her. ‘I don’t think your clothing does you any favours.’

But instead of mentioning Johnson’s weight issue, she offered to connect her with a wardrobe stylist.

At the end of the conversation, Fedida said: ‘I feel much better when I work out.’

‘Not once did she call me fat, say I had to lose weight, or hint that my job was in jeopardy,’ writes Jonson in her column.

‘But what I did hear was, “Lose weight, or lose your job”,’ she writes.

According to Johnson, the conversation she had with Fedida freed her to ‘finally tackle what I couldn’t ever do before’.

By cutting carbohydrates, eating less and moving more, she lost 72 pounds — the basis for her new book, The Shift, which she dedicated to Fedida.

Johnson says she is a ‘happier and healthier woman’ and for the first time in her life she now wears dresses.

‘Barbara did for me what doctors, family and friends never could,’ writes Johnson in her column in the New York Post.

‘Since then, friends have said they wish their bosses would tell them to lose weight because so far they haven’t listened to anyone else.’

Johnson added: ‘I’m forever grateful for her gentle grace during that difficult workplace chat that changed my life — may have even saved it.’

Apart from her work for the ABC, Johnson is also an entrepreneur and has built two multi-million-dollar businesses, Women For Hire and Spark & Hustle.

She is also a New York Times bestselling author and has written six other books: Women For Hire: The Ultimate Guide to Getting a Job; Women For Hire's Get-Ahead Guide to Career Success; Take this Book to Work: How to Ask for (and Get) Money, Fulfillment, and Advancement; Will Work From Home: Earn the Cash Without the Commute; Fired to Hired: Bouncing Back from Job Loss to Get to Work Right Now; and her most recent book, Spark & Hustle: Launch and Grow Your Small Business Now.
