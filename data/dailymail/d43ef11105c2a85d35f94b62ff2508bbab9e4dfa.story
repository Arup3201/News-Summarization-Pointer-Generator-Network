Halloween is firmly on the horizon so weird, scary and creepy sights are becoming commonplace. 

In this video, a dog attempts to get into the Halloween spirit by transforming himself into the most intimidating predator of them all... but falls somewhat short of giving anybody a scare.

The adorable pug wanders around the front driveway of his home nonchalantly dressed in a Tyrannosaurus rex costume.

Rawr! An adorable pug gets into the Halloween spirit in a dinosaur costume

Rest: After walking around for 30 seconds in the awkward costume the pug takes a breather

The dog's owner films the pet as he attempts to move about in the comical costume, which occasionally slips off as he awkwardly meanders about.

The T-rex costume also has two protruding claws which makes it look like the dog is ready to attack at any opportunity.

However, this cute canine is anything but frightening. 

Awkward: The pug's movement is a little restricted and he peers out from within the comical costume
