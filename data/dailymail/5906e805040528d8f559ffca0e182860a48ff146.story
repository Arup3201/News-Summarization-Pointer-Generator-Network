After a game of schoolyard football took a nasty turn last week, one teenager was left with such a severe injury he had to be rushed to hospital.

The school maintain when James Webb disfigured his right arm after he snapped the two bones in his forearm, it was an unfortunate accident, but the 13-year-old's mother thinks something more sinister was at play.

Photographs show James' forearm completely warped and bent as though it was made from play-doh.

The x-ray revealed the teenager had completely snapped both his radius and ulna, the two main bones that make up the forearms.

Vikki Webb told The Northern Star her son was targeted by bullies who had set out to deliberately injure him during a game of 'grab football' last Tuesday.

A group of year 7 students at Ballina High School were taking part in the game at recess, when they began swinging James around by his arm, Ms Webb said.

James was then apparently pinned to the ground while another boy jumped on top of him, which is when onlookers are said to have heard the loud snap of his arm breaking.

While still on James' back with his arms around his neck, the boy then allegedly kicked the victim's broken arm - sending it flying in the opposite direction.

Ms Webb said her son doesn't remember anything about the incident, which is where the conflicting stories arise.

However after speaking to onlookers the boy's mother reached the conclusion that the attack was deliberate and unprovoked.

One student told Ms Webb the attacker laughed during the incident and said the whole ordeal was 'fun'.

A spokesman for the Department of Education, on behalf of Ballina High School, told the publication that the accident occurred when James was pushed over and other student fell on top of him.

'The evidence of student and staff reports does not suggest a deliberate attempt to break the victim's arm,' the spokesperson said.

A formal complaint had been made to police and the investigation is ongoing, while James' alleged attacker had been suspended for four days.
