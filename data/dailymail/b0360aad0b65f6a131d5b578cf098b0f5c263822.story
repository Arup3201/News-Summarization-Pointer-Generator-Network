Tariq Al Habtoor has been convicted of kidnapping the dog he had given away in a 'military-style' operation

With a billionaire for a father, Tariq Al Habtoor is perhaps used to getting what he wants.

So when the 22-year-old decided that giving his pedigree Labrador to a fellow student was a mistake, he assumed money would get the animal back.

But Roseanna Morgan refused his offer of £1,500, saying Ozzy was not for sale.

Al Habtoor, from Dubai, then took the extraordinary step of dognapping the animal in the dead of night. His mission succeeded – but he gave himself away by documenting his movements on Twitter.

Yesterday, a judge threw out his appeal against a community sentence for the theft and imposed a suspended jail sentence.

The saga began last December when Al Habtoor, whose father owns a hotel chain and has played polo with Prince Charles, offered Ozzy for free, saying the one-year-old needed more space and a family to play with.

He posted a picture of the dog – whose pedigree name is Douglas Ozito Dormillon – on a Kingston University website

Miss Morgan, 22, and her boyfriend Joshua Gold, 23, stepped in and took Ozzy to Mr Gold’s family farm in the village of Chislet, Kent.

But two weeks later Al Habtoor decided he wanted the dog back and made his £1,500 offer. It was rejected and on March 28 he drove 70 miles to the farm to kidnap Ozzy. His tweeted updates included ‘patience is a virtue’, ‘time for a late night mission’ and, at 5.30am, ‘success!’

Al Habtoor, who claimed all he wanted was one last visit with the dog, was spotted clearing a 5ft fence with Ozzy before making off in his silver Range Rover.

The engineering student was questioned by police but refused to say what he had done with the dog.

Apparently
abandoned, Ozzy was found in High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, more than 
40 miles from Al Habtoor’s home in Surrey. Representing himself at 
Canterbury Crown Court yesterday, Al Habtoor said: ‘I felt wronged when I
wasn’t allowed my last visit. I had given everything for free.

When he was 16, Tariq Al Habtoor fled from the home of his strict 
father, Rashid, said to be a devout Muslim, to live with his mother, 
Sarra Fotheringham, in Surrey.

As a teenager in Dubai, Al Habtoor was surrounded by bodyguards and unable to go out with his friends.

In
2008, he reportedly got away from his bodyguards, hailed a taxi to 
Dubai International Airport and boarded a plane to London in his school 
uniform.

It was the first time he had seen his mother in nine years.

‘I
didn’t ask for anything. I just wanted a visit. I know that what I did 
was wrong by taking the dog but it was the only way I was going to be 
able to see him.

‘To me he 
wasn’t just an animal, but when I thought I wasn’t going to see him 
again I felt I had no choice. I tried to negotiate but there seemed to 
be no way we could be civilised about it.’

Asked
why he planned the ‘military-style operation’, Al Habtoor replied: ‘I 
didn’t really think that I would make it. I thought I would be caught.’

He said his studies stopped him doing the 120 hours of voluntary work initially imposed on him by magistrates.

‘I
am a full-time student in my second year of engineering,’ he said.  ‘I 
don’t have time for community service, so I would rather have a 
suspended sentence or a prison sentence.’ But his appeal was thrown out 
in barely five minutes.

Giving
him a six-month prison sentence, suspended for two years, Judge Nigel 
Van Der Bijl told him: ‘I am sorry but I can’t offer you a place in 
prison.’

Al Habtoor was 
ordered to pay a further £450 costs on top of the £760 bill he ran up 
during the magistrates hearing in September.

He claimed that the dog was found in High Wycombe after escaping through a hole in the fence of a property he was using.
