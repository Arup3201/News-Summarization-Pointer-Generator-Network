A frail pensioner who was snatched from a care home by his concerned family and flown to Turkey to be cared for by his daughter died just five months after she was jailed by the Court of Protection.

John Maddocks, 80, from Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, suffered from dementia and was first placed in a care home in 2009 while recovering from a bout of tuberculosis. 

However his daughter Wanda, 52, who was living in Turkey at the time, had promised her father she would never allow him to be put into care and became frustrated with the situation.

In the following years, until his death in January 2013, she fought with the authorities to free him from the care home and even ended up imprisoned for six weeks under the secret Court of Protection.

Details surrounding the case have now come to light during a three-day inquest to determine the circumstances leading up to Mr Maddocks' death.

An inquest into the death of John Maddocks, 80, (right), from Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, has heard how his daughter Wanda, 52 (left), was jailed for taking him out of a care home and to her Turkish home in 2009

Wanda told the hearing how she was desperate to free her father from the first care home because she claims it was an 'awful place for him to be' and that he thought about taking his own life while there.

The property developer arranged for the former painter and decorator to be moved to a nearby privately-run residential home after just two months, but said her father was so miserable that he would try to escape by fleeing on a bus or changing his clothes to disguise himself.

She desperately wanted to take her father to her home in Turkey, where she believed he would enjoy better quality of life and recuperate. However, she found out from the authorities that she had no influence over her father's care without getting power of attorney over his affairs.

She tried to obtain power of attorney but was told she would need up to £15,000 in legal fees.

Her father was later moved to another Staffordshire care home in November 2010, but Mr Maddocks apparently hated it just as much as the other homes.

Wanda said: 'He was depressed there. He wouldn't eat.'

The final straw came on Christmas Day 2010 when Wanda visited her father but was told she was only allowed one hour with him, supervised by staff. 

She said she called her three brothers, Ivan, 55, Wayne, 54, and Eden, 49, who lived near their father and visited him regularly, and between them they hatched a plan to free him.

The following day, on Boxing Day 2010, the three men went to the care home, got their father out of the fire door, took him for a meal and then called Wanda. She then took him to her home in Turkey, where he remained for 13 weeks.

Wanda said: 'Two of my brothers got him out through the fire doors and they passed him to me and I took him to Turkey. It was the great escape.'

However, the Court of Protection – which was set up to safeguard vulnerable individuals – got wind of the situation and, when Wanda flew back to the UK with her father in February 2011, the pair were prevented from returning to Turkey.

Wanda said: 'We flew back to sort his pension, only to find his money had been frozen. Then the whole Court of Protection thing started.

'We were basically told that if we did not adhere to whatever decisions the Court made, we could be jailed and our assets seized.'

Mr Maddocks was made the subject of a Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards order and taken into care again – at Abbots House care home in Abbey Hulton, Stoke-on-Trent - while Wanda was forced to attend more than 20 court hearings and be subjected to several psychiatric evaluations.

She was eventually jailed for six weeks in mid-2012 at Foston Hall women's prison near Derby, which once housed Maxine Carr, girlfriend of Soham killer, Ian Huntley.

She became the first person to be jailed by the so-called 'secret court', the Court of Protection, which settles the affairs of those deemed too ill to make their own decisions.

Her crime was contempt of court, for repeatedly breaking orders not to interfere with her father's life at his care home.

However, she believes her only crime was an act of compassion towards the father she loved and trying to keep a solemn promise to him to keep him out of care homes.

Following her release from prison, her father was moved to yet another care home in December 2012 before being taken into hospital for illness. He died weeks later on January 8, 2013.

Wanda told the inquest today: 'My dad always said to me "Don't you ever put me in a care home" and I never forgot those words.

'There was a fair amount of disagreement between myself, social services and the city council.

'I thought it was better for him to be in the sunshine in Turkey rather than in a care home.

'They said he was too aggressive to be in the community and he had put his fist up.'

The jury was also told how Wanda was happy for her father to be in a nursing home – which provides additional care – but wasn't satisfied with him being in a care home.

However, staff at the care home told the inquest that Mr Maddocks was being cared for in the right place at the time.

Care worker Amanda Cain said: 'We were able to meet Mr Maddocks's needs. At times he was aggressive but that could be very short-lived.'

The inquest continues.
