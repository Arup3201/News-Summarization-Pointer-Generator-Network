A hunter charged with starting one of California's largest ever wildfires allegedly tried to claim it was started by drug growers, it has been claimed.  

Keith Matthew Emerald, 32, is accused of starting a campfire on August 17 last year in an area where fires were prohibited in Stanislaus National Forest.

The blaze that took hold a year ago turned into a massive Rim Fire raging for two months across 400 square miles of land after spreading to Yosemite National Park, threatening thousands of structures, destroying 11 homes and costing more than $125million to fight.

Investigators Investigators focused on Emerald, who was rescued by helicopter about an hour after the fire was reported, and almost immediately and repeatedly interviewed him over the course of the following several weeks while firefighters battled the blaze.

Officers said Emarald at times acknowledged starting the fire and other times denied it.

Hunting for deer with a bow that day, he initially told investigators that he caused a rock slide that sparked the fire, according to a search warrant affidavit for Emerald’s house and other sites.

He then allegedly suggested it was started by marijuana growers in the area.

After multiple interviews and a promise from investigators that they would keep his name out of the media for as long as they could, he acknowledged having a lighter, starting a fire and cooking a meal, according to the affidavit.

He burned rubbish from his backpack, but some of the embers blew uphill and set the brush on fire, he allegedly told investigators in a handwritten statement with some misspellings.

‘The terrain was almost vertical, so I physically couldn't put it out,’ he wrote.

He later went back on this comment, but investigators said a man who drove Emerald to pick up his truck after the fire began said the hunter acknowledged setting a campfire that got out of control.

Calls to Emerald’s attorney, federal public defender Janet Bateman, have not yet been returned, AP reports.

Emerald, a resident of Columbia, a town in the Sierra Nevada foothills, is also charged with lying to a federal agent. Prosecutors said no court date has been set for his arraignment.

'The Rim Fire was one of the largest in California history and caused tremendous economic and environmental harm,' U.S. Attorney Benjamin Wagner said in a written statement. 

'While those harms cannot be undone, today we have brought criminal charges relating to the cause of the fire.'

The charges were the result of an investigation by the U.S. Forest Service and the Tuolumne County district attorney's office, Wagner said.
