The prospect of Floyd Mayweather Jnr ever meeting Manny Pacquiao in the centre of a ring suffered another blow after the Filipino extended his contract with promoter Top Rank.

Pacquiao has committed himself to Bob Arum’s outfit until the end of 2016, by which time he will be 38 and surely considering retirement.

The eight-division world champion’s fights are shown on HBO in America while Mayweather is contracted to rival Showtime, meaning a fight between the two is highly unlikely.

Deal: Manny Pacquiao has extended his contract with promoter Top Rank

Showdown: Pacquiao's new deal means a fight with Floyd Mayweather is less likely

Deal breaker: Bob Arum claims that a fight between Pacquiao and Mayweather can still happen

Mayweather has three fights left on that deal, taking him to September 2015.

Arum, however, claimed the $300million mega-fight could still happen.

‘We want to fight him and we’re willing to discuss it at any point,’ he said. ‘There are two ways to go here. One is to do a Mayweather fight with both HBO and Showtime involved, as they did with Lewis-Tyson, as I understand Mayweather is under contract to Showtime through 2015. The companies could come together and put on the show.

‘Or, the other alternative is, if Floyd wanted to fight Manny in 2016, he could return to HBO and we could do it there.’

Veteran: Pacquiao is now contracted to Top Rank until 2016 when he will be 38-years-old

A further obstacle to the fight is the fractured relationship between Arum and Golden Boy CEO Richard Schaefer.

Mayweather has worked with Golden Boy since 2007 and has previously stated his loyalty to Schaefer.

The 37-year-old will return to the ring on September 13 having outpointed Marcos Maidana in Las Vegas earlier this month.

Pacquiao, meanwhile, could fight Juan Manuel Marquez for a fifth time in Macau in November.
