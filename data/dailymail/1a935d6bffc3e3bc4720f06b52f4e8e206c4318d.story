A couple who claimed to be so broke they had to borrow money from relatives ran up £1million in fraudulent debt and spent it on a fleet of Bentleys and Range Rovers.

Jeremy Palmer, 53, and his wife Dawn, 50, from Dunton near Basildon in Essex managed to obtain a credit card in the name of an unwitting relative to rack up debt between 2002 and 2008.

The couple, who pleaded not guilty, were jailed for a total of eight and a half years when they appeared at Blackfriars Crown Court yesterday following a seven-week trial.

They had used the name of Mrs Palmer's innocent brother, Mark Waterhouse, to acquire credit and buy three Range Rover Sports and two Bentleys and take out massive overdrafts.

The shocked 51-year-old from Chelmsford, Essex, said he felt 'abused' by his family's betrayal and has not spoken to his sister and brother-in-law since their arrest in 2011.

He said: 'I was devastated; couldn't believe it.'

'I'm still shocked to be honest. I had helped them in the past when they had money troubles, they were always borrowing money.

'I feel totally abused. You don't expect this from your own family.'

Mrs Palmer also claimed to earn more than £200,000 a year to secure further advances against the marital home in Brentwood Road, Dunton, using her maiden name.

The total amount of credit obtained and losses run up with the bank and on credit cards amounted to more than £1million. 

Mr Palmer was jailed for six years after he was convicted of 16 counts and his wife was found guilty of five counts and was sentenced to 30 months imprisonment.

Essex Police spent three years investigating the couple's fraudulent activity.

Detective Sergeant Danny Walker, investigating officer, said: 'This was a prolonged, multi-faceted series of fraud offences where advantage was taken of a member of their family.

'The motivation for these offences was pure greed and the money obtained was used to purchase cars and other items which otherwise they would not have been unable to afford.

'Their selfish crimes have caused damage to a family which no money or prison sentence can repair.'
