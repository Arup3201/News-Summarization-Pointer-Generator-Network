Stuck: Firefighters had to break apart a chimney to extract Genoveva Nunez-Figueroa, 30, who had gotten stuck while trying to break into a home

A woman who was rescued from inside a California home's chimney had recently been dumped by the homeowner, whom she'd met online.

Genoveva Nunez-Figueroa had been on a few dates with the occupant, identified only as Lawrence, weeks before she allegedly tried to break into his home.

And it wasn't the first time she'd been caught at Lawrence's home.

He told KABC she was there two weeks before and she ran off when he threatened to call police.

'It’s actually the second attempt for her trying to access the inside of my house from the roof,' he told CBS LA. 

'I'm going to be a little more cautious of who I invite into my house now,' he said, though he didn't specify whether it was property or Lawrence himself that Nunez-Figueroa may have been after in the home.

Lawrence said he'd recently ended things with the 28-year-old. 

Firefighters responded to the scene were forced to take apart the chimney brick by brick and then squirt dish soap inside to free Nunez-Figueroa.

Neighbors first heard the sound of a woman crying coming from atop the two-story home early Sunday. 

When police arrived, they found Nunez-Figueroa still conscious but stuck near the top of the flue.

Firefighters used handheld demolition hammers to remove bricks from the chimney in order to get down to where Nunez-Figueroa was trapped.

Once they reached her, they poured soap down the chimney to make removal easier, according to Ventura County Fire Department spokesperson Captain Mike Lindbery.

'Chimney flue was lubricated with dish soap prior to hoisting patient,' read the accompanying caption to a photo of the rescue tweeted from Lindbery's account. 

Nunez-Figueroa was lifted out of the destroyed chimney and taken to the hospital for an evaluation before being arrested for illegal entry and giving false information to a peace officer.  

'I’m feeling better, not so weirded out anymore that that person isn’t in my chimney anymore,' the homeowner said.

'Trying to figure out what I’m going to do with my chimney since it’s in pieces but better my chimney than probably me,' he added.

Nunez-Figueroa's family has offered to pay the homeowner for his destroyed chimney.
