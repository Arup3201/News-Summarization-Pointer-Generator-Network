Being known as one of the game's greatest AFL players would mean nothing to Adam Goodes if it's the only memory people have of him, the star has revealed.

In light of last week's social media war with Shane Warne - which touched on Goodes' Australian of The Year title - the Sydney Swan has opened-up about life as and indigenous ambassador to Aboriginal people and the 'legacy' of being a father.

Speaking about life other than football, the premiership-winning captain said being an Aboriginal person doesn't stop when you win Australian of The Year and that his greatest hope from a career in AFL is not to create history on the field, but off it.

Adam Goodes wants to be known for more than just his on-field attributes when he retires

Some punters on Twitter attacked Warne (left) for not knowing about Goodes' title (right)

Goodes was the 2014 Australian Of The Year

In a one-on-one interview the star has revealed that should he not be remembered for reasons other than AFL, then he hasn't achieved his life aims.

'If people only remember me for my football...I've failed at life,' he told the Sydney Morning Herald.

'I live by that quote.'

Goodes was borrowing a similar belief from a 1980s basketball player, former Detroit Piston guard Isiah Thomas, who was an African American player.

'He uses basketball,' Goodes said. 'I change it to football.' 

'If I'm only defined by my sport, I really have failed.' 

His other legacy, he said, is his children. And while he said he isn't even married yet there will be a time when he looks forward to bringing them into his life.

On Shane Warne and the controversial Twitter admission he made during an AFL match where the leg spinner said he was 'shocked' he won the Australian Of The Year honour, Goodes said:

'My argument has always been, 'I didn't nominate me...I don't have a vote on the Australia Day council, it's their choice.' 

Former test Cricketer Adam Gilchrist who is a member of the Australian Day council said Shane Warne is entitled to his opinion on both the AFL player and the Australian of The Year winner, but stopped at saying Warne was 'racist'.

'Some have misconstrued Warnie's comments as racist. People have got wildly out of control if they think that.'  

During an AFL game on Saturday Former Australian cricketer Shane Warne made a bizarre admission on Twitter that he didn't know Swans star Adam Goodes was Australian of the Year 

Goodes hit back on Sunday morning mentioning Warne's former teammate and fellow cricketer Adam Gilchrist

The comments where made during an AFL match between the Sydney Swans and Richmond Tigers on Saturday evening.

Warne accused Swans star Adam Goodes of staging, or taking theatrical dives in order to earn free kicks during the game.

'Come on tigers beat those Swans and make the finals. By the way, does everyone get annoyed when Adam Goodes always "stages" for free kicks ?' Warne wrote. 

It was soon after he said he was shocked to learn of Goodes January award: 'I think Syd or the Hawks will win the flag. Shocked as I just found out Goodes was Aust of the year, wow ! Who votes for that?' Warne wrote in a bizarre tweet.

Australian cricket captain Michael Clarke said called Swans star Goodes a 'legend' during the exchange

 

What followed was many puzzled punters asking what he meant by his comments, while other users were astounded he missed the news.

One wrote to Warne 'So much respect gone for you. Use to like you but you're actually a flog. Can't believe I looked up to you as a kid.'

Others joked that they thought the former cricketer's account to be a parody based on his recent comments, only to discover it wasn't.

On Sunday morning Adam Goodes responded to the exchange as he pointed out that Australian cricketer and one of Warne's former teammates Adam Gilchrist, is the head of the Australia Day Council.

Michael Clarke also responded that Shane Warne could be the next Australian of the Year

'@ShaneWarne thanks for your support mate maybe ask @gilly381 who votes for it he is the chair of the Australia Day Council'. Goodes wrote.

Warne then repeated his initial advice for Goodes to stop diving, and wished the Swans star luck for the upcoming finals.

'@adamroy37 Just stop staging for free kicks mate. You should be better than that as Aust of the year !!! Good luck in the finals', Warne tweeted.

Some twitter users threw their support behind Warne over the strange sentiments, while many other people were astounded by the comments made by the former cricketer.

One user commended Goodes on his response and wrote: 'Well done Adam, so tired of ppl (people) undermining your achievements'.

Warne ended the conversation with the same comment he began it with - about staging during the match
