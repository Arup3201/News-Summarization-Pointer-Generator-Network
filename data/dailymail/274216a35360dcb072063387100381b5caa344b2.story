A hard-partying Baltimore woman who was shocked to find a $362 Uber cab fare after a night of drinking has managed to recoup her loss - and then some - with crowd funding  

Gabrielle Wathen used the online cab service to get home after her 26th birthday party on Halloween Friday night. 

She was charged nine times the standard rate because 'prime time' surge pricing was in effect for the 22-minute ride back to her apartment.

She set up a page on GoFundMe called 'Uber Stole My 26th Birthday' and said she 'spent a good two hours of my birthday crying over' the massive taxi bill. 

'I feel taken advantage of and cheated by the Uber name. $367 for a 20 minute ride should never be justified, even on Halloween,' she wrote.  

Within 12 hours, Miss Wathen was able to raise nearly $600 from sympathetic donors - enough to cover the bill and pay for another big night out. The page has since been taken down. 

As many commentators on her page pointed out, even highly intoxicated, she should have known the cab ride would have been expensive.

Uber alerts riders when surge pricing is in effect and the smartphone app makes passengers type in the price increase (in this case, nine times the standard rate.)

'I felt sympathy for maybe a second, because I've been in a position where I couldn't get a cab to save my life, and walking when I get off work at 3am is dangerous. I take Uber all the time and you have to AGREE to the rates! Even drunk I've known what I could spend. They didn't steal anything from you... But it sure looks like you have no problem stealing from others,' one user wrote. 

Another commenter said: 'Um, you have to type in the amount for Uber when it's at peak. I'd be happy to take you to an AA meeting instead...' 

Wathen wrote: 'I live in Baltimore and went out with my friends to celebrate my birthday at midnight.

'When 3 AM rolled around, I suggested we take an Uber home to avoid drunk driving (#responsibility/#MADD). 

'I live 22 minutes, tops, from the party I was leaving.When I awoke this morning, I heard a friend talking about how outrageous Uber rates were the night before (9x original rate). 

'I checked my bank account when, unbeknownst to me, I see a charge for $362.

Birthday girl: In a post called 'Uber Stole My 26th Birthday,' Wathen wrote she took an Uber home to avoid drunk driving

'Not only is it my 26th birthday, it is rent day. My rent is $450 and I can no longer pay it today due to this completely outrageous charge.  

She wrote: 'I worked incredibly hard this week to be able to enjoy my birthday this weekend. 

'This misunderstanding has cost me 80 per cent of the funds I have to my name (embarrassingly so) and I spent a good two hours of my birthday crying over it.

‘I feel taken advantage of and cheated by the Uber name,’ she added. 'Thanks for the ride, Muhammed.

‘$367 for a 20-minute ride should never be justified, even on Halloween.'

'Please donate even just $1 if you think this is utter and complete bullsh*t and also hilarious and very, very depressing at the same time.’
