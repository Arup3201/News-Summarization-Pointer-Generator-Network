A  video of a woman dancing as she listens to music on headphones at a bus stop has become an internet sensation.

Secretary Ellie Coles, 34, waggles her head, sways her legs and punches the air in the clip set to Abba’s Dancing Queen – which has been viewed more than 380,000 times on YouTube.

Her daily performances waiting for the bus home from work cheered up locals and the effect now appears to have gone global.

Jane Rowland, 45 - whose partner filmed it - owns a cafe opposite the bus stop in Eastleigh, Hampshire.

She said: ‘Everyone around here knows about her and drivers beep their appreciation for her moves as they go past.

‘She has no problems dancing away and is an inspiration to us all.

‘People watching it in America have said it's been the first thing to
make them smile after the horrendous attack in Boston at the weekend.'

Miss
Coles revealed she is dancing to Knock Down by Britain's Got Talent 
judge Alesha Dixon in the film which is titled Eastleigh's Got Talent 
and has received 69,700 'likes' on Facebook.

She finger points, waves her hands in circles, and seems to keep time with the Abba song dubbed over the clip.

Before the bus arrives she produces a downward karate-style punch before
flagging it down with a small flourish at the end of her 
routine.

Miss Coles, from Southampton - who has now met 
her fan Mrs Rowland - said: ‘I have my headphones in every day on the 
way back from work and I just can't help myself - I just dance.

‘My mum thinks I'm bonkers. But I'm a normal 34-year-old woman who just loves to dance.’

Mrs
Rowland's partner Nigel Baker, a former DJ, said more than a quarter of
a million people watched the video within minutes of it being uploaded.

He said: ‘I chose a soundtrack of Dancing Queen by Abba as it seemed 
so appropriate, though I had no idea what she was really humming.

‘Jane spotted Ellie dancing first and we thought it was worth recording.

‘We
shared it with a few friends online and it was a hit within minutes - 
it's even being talked about on American radio stations.

‘We've had so many positive comments from people who love the video. It's a bit of fun and we all just love her.’

Mrs Rowland said: ‘I couldn't believe it when the video went viral - the reaction has been phenomenal.

‘I
think it's really served to cheer everyone up. We missed out on our 
daily show yesterday as there was someone else waiting at the bus stop 
too, and she was busy talking to them.‘Her performances always bring a smile to our faces in here and keeps our customers amused.‘The best bit is when she keeps dancing and does a special little move to flag the bus down.

‘We're on a busy road and you hear cars and vans beeping at her and she'll put her hand up to acknowledge them.

‘She's certainly got rhythm and we all love her cheerful attitude.’

Fans from Australia, Brazil and America have commented on the hit YouTube video.

Nigel
Cox said: ‘I hope she realises just how fantastic she is. A really 
positive advertisement of how life should be enjoyed, each and every 
day.’

Rachel Connor posted: ‘What a sweetheart, she made my day.’

Paul K Davies wrote: ‘She is awesome! You dance, girl.’
