Nightmare: Cory Tschogl, 39, pictured has an Airbnb guest squatting in her condo

A California Airbnb host says a guest is squatting in her 600-square-foot Palm Springs condo and is now threatening to sue her.

Cory Tschogl, 39, described the situation as a 'horror story' and says she begged Airbnb for help through scores of emails and phone calls but the accommodation marketplace failed to get the renter out.

He now has renters' protection under California law because he's been there longer than 30 days and it'll take three to six months, a lawyer and thousands of dollars to evict him.

The San Francisco-based rehabilitation therapist has used Airbnb without issue for about a year so when 'Maksym' asked to rent the condo for an extended period - a total of 44 days - she thought it would be fine.

But as soon as he checked in he called her to complain about the tap water being cloudy and the gated-entrance to the condo, then demanded a full refund of the 30 days rent he paid upfront.

For longer stays, Airbnb bills on a monthly basis rather than the total sum.

Concerned that he was a shady character, she agreed to a refund and immediately alerted Airbnb to make it happen.

However, after numerous attempts to make contact with the service, it took two days for a representative to respond. In that email, the rep said Airbnb had told the guest to leave.

But Tschogl says the guest stayed in the condo.

'It became a confusing situation. Both I and Airbnb told the guest to leave, but he would not,' she told Business Insider.

The company eventually paid her the two weeks' missing rent and offered to pay for the man to stay at a hotel for 30 days but he didn't respond to emails and his phone was cut off.

After the 
44 days, Tschogl was desperate and texted Maksym saying his contract was
 up and that she would shut off power at the condo.

Tschogl
 told the San Francisco Chronicle that the guest texted back saying he 
was legally occupying the condo - which isn't untrue - and that loss of 
electricity would threaten his work and therefore income.

He threatened to press charges for 'blackmail and damages caused by your negligence and malicious misconduct, including $3,800 PID Espresso machine as well as medical bills for my brother's hospital visit after he got sick here drinking unfiltered tap water.'

Tschogl researched the situation online and was advised by other landlords to hire a lawyer, who told her that in California, once someone rents a property for 30 days, that person is considered a tenant on a month-to-month lease. She couldn't just ask authorities to kick him out.

She told The Chronicle she was sorely disappointed in Airbnb's efforts to help.

'They were almost absent,' she says. 'There was no phone number or direct contact e-mail. I got e-mail responses only every 24 to 48 hours.'

Airbnb said in a statement: 'Our initial response to this inquiry didn't meet the standards we set for ourselves and we've apologized to this host.

'In the last week, officials from our team have been in incredibly close contact with this host and she has been paid the full cost of the reservation and we're working with her to provide additional support as we move forward.'

After being contacted by The Chronicle, Airbnb is now offering to assist in her legal fees.
