An internet advert that compared a scantily clad woman to a spicy Pot Noodle has been banned by watchdogs for being 'crass and degrading'.

The 'Hot Off' advert for Piri Piri Pot Noodle featured on the snack's Facebook page and showed a woman posing in red knickers and a revealing red bra.

The image was posted alongside a picture of the snack and a caption asking visitors 'Which one gets you hotter?'

A Pot Noodle advert comparing a semi-naked woman to the snack has been banned for being 'crass and degrading'. Two other ads, including this one of a woman stripping, were cleared by the watchdog

Three adverts for spicy Pot Noodles - including a video of a woman taking her top off (pictured) - were investigated after 18 people complained to the ASA

It formed part of an internet campaign by the brand featuring three sexually provocative adverts with the strapline 'Peel the top off a hottie'.

The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) launched its investigation after receiving 18 complaints that claimed the ads were offensive, sexist and degrading to women.

Some complained that it was irresponsible and harmful because it suggested it was acceptable to try and remove women's clothing without their consent.

The ASA ruled that the Hot Off ad had breached its regulatory code.

It said its 'presentation of the woman in a sexual pose and the blatant comparison with the food product was crass and degrading and therefore likely to cause serious offence.'Â 

The ASA ruled the ad comparing women to food with strap line 'Peel the top off a Hottie' was offensive

The watchdog acknowledged the ad was 'tongue in cheek', but ordered that it be removed and told Unilever, the owner of the Pot Noodle brand, to avoid using offensive imagery in future campaigns.

Two other adverts that attracted criticism from members of the public were cleared, although the watchdog said viewers may find them 'distasteful'.

One showed a man struggling to eat a spicy Piri Piri chicken flavour Pot Noodle before fantasizing about dancing with a female passenger who eventually takes her top off followed by the strapline 'peel a top off a hottie'.

After he finished the Pot Noodle he realises he has been dancing with a man.

The ASA disputed viewers' complaints that the advert was too sexually provocative or degrading, as the woman danced with the man while the woman removed her top voluntarily.

The ASA cleared two of the adverts, including one in which showed a man fantasizes about a woman stripping but when he finishes his Pot Noodle realises he had been dancing with a man (pictured)

A second advert on the Facebook page, which showed cartoon versions of the pair alongside two Pot Noodle lids arranged to resemble a woman's bust was judged as having a humorous tone and allowed to stay.

The watchdog said: 'We considered that although some visitors
to the Pot Noodle Facebook page may have found the "Peel the top of a 
hottie" to be distasteful, we considered that none of the ads condoned 
the removal of a woman's clothing without her consent or suggested that 
such an act was likely to be acceptable.'

According to the ASA, Unilever said the campaign was 'cheeky and humorous' in tone and that 'despite an element of light-hearted innuendo, the ads did not in any way condone or advocate that it was acceptable to remove another person's clothing without their consent.'
