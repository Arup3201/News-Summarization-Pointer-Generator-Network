Innocent: Kenrick Wickham was mistaken for a crack cocaine dealer and murdered in West Dulwich, London, last year

Three members of a gang who executed an innocent man after mistaking him for drug dealer were jailed for a total of at least 81 years today.

Anthony McKenzie, 23, Samir Yusuf, 24, and Devana Palmer, 21, were all handed lengthy prison terms for the murder of Kenrick Wickham who was shot in the back of the head as he begged for mercy.

Mr Wickham, 36, who was also shot twice in the neck, was bundled into a black Audi A3 after being mistaken for crack dealer O'Neill 'Power' Miller in June last year.

McKenzie was given the longest sentence for pulling the trigger in West Dulwich, London.

Sentencing the trio, Judge William referred to the 'dreadful tragedy' that saw 26 adults and children gunned down at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut on Friday.

He said: 'It does not need the dreadful tragedy of last Friday in America to remind us all of the almost limitless power of the gun to damage and destroy.

'Guns are not bling, they are not a designer accessory available to foolish young men to impress other foolish young men, they are killing machines.

'It must be clearly understood that those involved in the taking of guns onto our streets which are then used to kill face life changing punishment.

'As Kenrick Wickham had his life casually snuffed out, so those responsible for it will see their lives forever altered, and your families will never be the same.

'In so far as Palmer and Yusuf are concerned, the finger of you was arguably as much upon the trigger as that of McKenzie.

'Those who ally themselves with the carrying and using of guns must understand they face exactly the same consequences.'

McKenzie, who was convicted of Mr Wickham's murder after a trial at the Old Bailey earlier this year, was sentenced to a minimum of 30 years behind bars.

Palmer and Yusuf were convicted of murder following a retrial at Snaresbrook Crown Court. Palmer was handed a minimum sentence of 25 years, while Yusuf will serve at least 26 years in jail.

Jurors were unable to reach a verdict on Kurt McLean, 27, in respect of the murder charge but he had already admitted plotting to rob the victim.

McLean, a father-of-one, will not face a second retrial and he was sentenced to seven years and eight month in prison for his part in the robbery plot.

Frightened West Dulwich, southeast London, residents heard shouts of 'murder, murder, murder' after Jamaican-born Mr Wickham was gunned down yards from his home in the early hours of June 23 last year.

He was pronounced dead at the scene.

Prosecutor Simon Denison QC said: 'He had been shot in close range, pleading for his life, before three bullets were fired in close range, one in the back of his head and two in the back of his neck.

'It is apparent that this was related to the trade in class A drugs, particularly crack cocaine.

'It became apparent that Kenrick Wickham may not have been the intended victim.'

Hours before Mr Wickham's murder, Yusuf arranged to meet O'Neill Miller in Kennington to buy three ounces of crack, with a street value of around Â£2,500.

He added: 'Mr Miller was staying with Mr Wickham in a flat in West Dulwich.

'The drugs were to be taken out of the flat to the car waiting outside where a simple and quick exchange of money for drugs was to take place.

'But it was Kenrick Wickham, not O'Neill Miller, who took the drugs outside.

'It wasn't just Yusuf waiting in that car, it was a group of four people who were there, including McLean, Palmer and McKenzie.

'What O'Neill didn't know was that the defendants had no intention of buying any drugs.

'They were intent on robbing and, we say, killing O'Neill Miller.'

Mr Miller saw his friend bundled into the back of the car and gave chase, the court heard.

'He jumped into his own car and drove to the end of the alleyway just around the corner,' said Mr Denison.

'He saw Yusuf's car and the defendants and McKenzie all out of the car standing around Kenrick Wickham.

'He saw McKenzie with a gun in his hand and he heard shots'.

The defendants were arrested moments after the shooting.

A blood-stained bullet that passed through Mr Wickham's head was discovered in the car, together with heavy duty handcuffs and a balaclava.

The four defendants remained expressionless as sentence was passed today.

Roy Ledgister, defending Mclean, said he was 'taken by surprise' by the firearm, of which he had no knowledge.

'This has been a real wake-up call for him and he is ready to turn his life around.'

Richard Carey-Hughes QC, for Palmer, said there was a 'gulf' between his and Yusuf's actions compared with McKenzie's.

Sally Bennett-Jenkins, defending Yusuf, added that he was a secondary party and criminally naive.

Judy Khan, acting for McKenzie, insisted the killing had been 'spontaneous'.

'When the firearm was brought to the scene it was not the overt intention for it to be used - something arose to bring that about,' she said.

McLean, of Oval, south London; Palmer, of Muswell Hill, north London; Yusuf, of Brixton, south London, and McKenzie, formerly of West Drayton, west London, all denied murder but admitted conspiracy to rob.
