The police force that guards the desert state of Utah will soon ask for volunteers from among its members for a particularly macabre duty.

Five-man firing squads are to be formed and trained in preparation for a move that critics say risks dragging America back to a 'more barbaric past'.

Facing a crisis in the lethal injection system by which most Death Row inmates are normally executed, Utah's leaders have just approved a solution that harks back to the violent spirit of its Wild West past.

The state has become the first to bring back the firing squad. Gary Herbert, Utah's Republican governor, conceded that he found the concept 'a little bit gruesome', but stressed that it would be used only if injection drugs are not available 30 days before a scheduled execution.

Yet such a scenario looks increasingly likely. Thirty-two states still have the death penalty, and America's Death Rows are clogged with more than 3,000 condemned prisoners because of a string of botched lethal injections. These have allowed lawyers to halt the scheduling of supposedly painless executions on the grounds that they breach a constitutional ban on 'cruel and unusual' punishment.

To make matters worse, supplies of the sedatives used are drying up. Many of the most effective drugs are made only in Europe, but the EU has told manufacturers they cannot sell them if they are to be used for lethal injections.

U.S. drug manufacturers have already stopped making them, worried about being associated with executions as a growing proportion of Americans come out against the death penalty. The result? In 2014, 35 people were executed in the U.S. — the fewest since 1994.

Last July, appalled witnesses described how convicted Arizona double murderer Joseph Wood lay gulping and gasping like a landed fish for two hours as a cocktail of drugs failed to do their job of sedating him and then stopping his heart.

Now, with Utah's dramatic announcement, opponents of capital punishment are questioning whether even Wood's fate is less barbaric than a squad of shooters blasting away at someone tied to a chair.

Although a firing squad may sound like a long-gone relic of frontier justice, the largely Mormon state of Utah did use one five years ago. In 2010, Ronnie Lee Gardner, a convicted murderer who had killed a lawyer during a court escape attempt, threatened to sue Utah if it didn't allow him to be shot.

The state had stopped offering Death Row inmates the option of a firing squad in 2004 — but because Gardner had been convicted before the law was changed, he was still able to choose it.

Gardner, who had been on Death Row for 19 years, said: 'I guess it's my Mormon heritage. It's so much easier . . . and there's no mistakes.'

Even though history has shown the killer's statement is not true, Utah's executioners will attempt to carry out the gruesome ritual with clinical precision.

Attached to the state prison at Draper, the small execution room — built in an old canning factory — is flooded with fluorescent light from the ceiling and has no decorations on its white cinderblock walls.

There are two slits for the marksmen cut into a wall, through which they aim their rifles. Observation windows — protected by bulletproof glass — line the side walls of the square chamber.

Screwed to a raised platform 25ft from the shooters' wall, a chair is flanked by sandbags to absorb blood and prevent ricochets. Behind the chair is thick wooden panelling to stop the bullets. The entire structure is painted black.

The inmate is bound to the chair with leather straps around the wrists, ankles, shoulders, waist and forehead — his immobility is crucial if the shooters are to hit his heart.

Locating the heart with a stethoscope, a doctor fastens a piece of white cloth two inches square, with a circle in the middle, over the left breast of the prisoner's jumpsuit.

Unseen by the condemned, or the victim's relatives and media representatives witnessing the execution on either flank, the squad of marksmen file in to take up position behind the wall facing their target.

The officers are chosen from a pool of volunteers, with priority going to those from the local force where the inmate's crimes were committed. There are always more volunteers than places on the squad.

Each officer is given an identical .30 calibre Winchester rifle, loaded with a single round.

Following a Utah tradition which means no marksman knows whether he has fired a lethal shot, one of the rifles contains a blank round made of wax. More ammunition is on hand if a second volley is needed.

When the moment comes, the prison warden will pick up a microphone in the execution chamber and typically give the prisoner two minutes to say his last words.

The governor then pulls a black hood over the inmate's head and leaves the room.

Unable to hear the countdown in the marksmen's enclosure, witnesses at Gardner's execution said they waited in awful suspense for 30 seconds until a deafening burst of almost simultaneous gunfire rang out. The target over his chest had three, possibly four, holes. A watching reporter said he saw Gardner then move his left arm, briefly clenching and unclenching his fist. He also saw, under the bottom of his hood, what looked like his jaw moving. As two minutes passed, he wondered if Gardner might need to be shot again.

Murderer Gary Gilmore's (pictured) last words were 'let's do it', moments before he was killed by firing squad. The phrase later became the inspiration for Nike's 'just do it' slogan

Instead, a prison official wearing blue plastic gloves stepped into the chamber, lifting the hood just enough to check the pulse on his neck. He then raised the hood further, shining a torch into his eyes to confirm he was dead.

In this situation, death is technically caused by blood loss from the rupture of the heart or tearing of the lungs. The prisoner is meant to lose consciousness when shock causes a fall in the supply of blood to the brain. If the shots are accurate, he is dead in seconds.

However, if the marksmen miss the heart — intentionally or by accident — the inmate will bleed to death slowly.

This occurred in Utah in 1879 when a firing squad missed murderer Wallace Wilkerson's heart. A white paper target had been placed over it, but Wilkerson — who had not been tied down — stiffened at the final moment.

His movement dislodged the target just as the marksmen fired, and Wilkerson leapt up screaming: 'Oh my God! They've missed it!'

It reportedly took him 27 minutes to die. Anti-death penalty campaigners claimed the shooters missed his heart on purpose to prolong his agony.

Utah's death penalty supporters insist that a well-trained firing squad would be faster and more humane than the protracted deaths caused by botched lethal injections.

Opponents counter that a firing squad is 'brutalising' and barbaric. In the past, politicians have also complained that condemned men have chosen a firing squad as a last burst of attention-seeking.

In Utah, condemned men have opted for it over lethal injection because it seems more manly.

In 1977, Gary Gilmore, one of the most notorious Death Row inmates of modern times, became the first person executed in the U.S. after a ten-year moratorium was lifted by the Supreme Court. The double murderer demanded to be executed by firing squad.

Asked if he had any last words, he simply replied: 'Let's do it.' (This week, the advertising executive who came up with the sports brand Nike's 'Just do it' slogan revealed he had been inspired by Gilmore.)

Utah, in fact, has dispatched all three of the prisoners killed by firing squad in the U.S. since the death penalty was restored in 1976.

The third was murderer John Albert Taylor, who refused to be sedated before he was shot in 1996 (though he did ask for a cigarette).

Utah — a state founded in bloodshed between Mormon settlers, native tribes and federal troops — may have a sentimental attachment to the law of the gun. But other states are proving no less ruthless in their determination to find an alternative to lethal injections.

Death by lethal injection remains the most common method of state-sanctioned execution. Pictured is the gurney at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary where death row inmates are injected

Politicians in Alabama and Tennessee have voted to bring back the electric chair, while Wyoming's state assembly passed a Bill to reintroduce firing squads.

In Oklahoma, where prisoner Clayton Lockett writhed and groaned for 43 minutes in a lethal injection disaster last year, they have voted to execute people by gassing them with nitrogen.

But only in Tennessee and Utah have these macabre initiatives made it onto the law books.

Even Texas, which in some years executes more people than the rest of America put together, recently announced it is down to its last dose of lethal injection.

Will a well-aimed shot to the heart kill a man as surely and humanely as a lethal injection in the arm?

The next man to find out may be former cult member Ron Lafferty, Utah's longest-serving Death Row inmate, who claimed God told him to kill his sister-in-law and her baby daughter in 1984 because she opposed his belief in polygamy.

Lafferty has requested a firing squad — no doubt when the time comes, his execution will spark a fierce bout of soul-searching in a nation that longs to be regarded as modern and compassionate, but on this issue is dragged back to its blood-soaked pioneer past.
