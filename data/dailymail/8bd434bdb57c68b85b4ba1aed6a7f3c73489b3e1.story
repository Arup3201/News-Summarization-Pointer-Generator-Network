A Los Angeles TV producer pulled off an epic Thanksgiving Twitter take-down of an apparently horrid fellow passenger on his flight to Phoenix yesterday that ended with the middle-aged woman slapping him in the face.

Elan Gale, whose Twitter bio says he's a producer on ABC's The Bachelor, began tweeting from the airport around 11 a.m. on Thanksgiving, after learning his flight was running behind schedule.

What came next was a blow by blow account, from 30,000 feet, of his note-passing battle with 'Diane from 7A' that would put most 7th graders to shame.

'Our flight is delayed. A woman on here is very upset because she has Thanksgiving plans. She is the only one obviously. Praying for her,' the long-haired, bearded Gale began.

He added: 'She's telling the flight attendants that it is Thanksgiving. She wants them to know she wants to have dinner with her family.'

According to Gale, the woman was getting pretty irate at the prospect of being late for her holiday dinner.

'The male flight attendant said "I understand ma'am. I'm looking forward to seeing my family too." She responded "This isn't about you,"' Gale tweeted. 

'Her family is very important to her, she says. Her family has a special recipe for stuffing. She needs to be there to help. It is crucial,' he wrote in a follow up.

First encounter: Gale's first tweet, pictured, on the subject revealed his flight was delayed that one passenger was particularly pissed off

Annoying: The woman continued to complain, according to Gale

Up in the air: Once seated, he bought he a glass of wine and wrote the woman, later revealed to be called Diane, a note, pictured

Gale said the woman couldn't believe that she might be late, and she wanted everyone to know about it.

'She has a connecting flight. Why doesn't anyone understand she has a connecting flight? Why do people not understand her needs?' he tweeted.

Finally, the plane took off, but the hilarious tit-for-tat was just getting started.

'She had to sit down because we took off. She has been muttering "about DAMN time" and I can hear her breathing from 5 rows back,' he tweeted, from up in the air.

That's when he decided to send her a glass of red wine. And a note. He took a picture of both for the pleasure of his 35,000 twitter followers who, if they were already sick to death of their own Thanksgivings, would have been following the action closely.

Upset: Though Gale, pictured, may have been the most confrontational, others on board were also aware of the impolite woman's behavior, he said

Enjoying the action: After the wine, Gale gave the woman two small bottles of vodka that the assistant handed him, after which he was a little nervous

The note read: 'Dear Lady in 7A, It has come to my attention that today is your 'Thanksgiving!' It must be hard to not be with your family. Please accept this glass of wine. It is a gift from me to you.

'Hopefully if you drink it, you won't be able to use your mouth to talk. Love Elan.'

Though he may have been the most confrontational, others on board were also aware of the impolite woman's behavior, he said.

'The male flight attendant is giving me the "let's just pretend this never happened" face. Shaking his head a lot,' he tweeted, before adding that the host took him aside.

'He gave me two little bottles of vodka but he won't hand them to her. He says I have to do it myself.'

He told the Twittersphere 'I'm going to do it.'

Then four minutes later, he wrote: 'Oh my God I did it I walked as if I was going to the bathroom and I leaned over and put them on her tray table and walked away Oh my God.'

He said, in response, the woman just stared at him 'really hard,' and was breathing through her teeth.

But he was clearly enjoying the altercation.

Retaliation: But the woman, Diane, struck back wit her own note, pictured

Warpath: 'This means war,' he tweeted, before sending out a description of his opponent to his tens of thousands of followers

'I'm not going to lie I am shaking this is so terrifying she is so angry at me it's kind of incredible,' he tweeted.

'I don't really know what to do now I'm afraid to get out of my seat. This is like being on a roller coaster I'm scared and super excited.'

But that's when the woman struck back.

'The male flight attendant just handed me a note from 7A,' he tweeted before posting a picture of the letter from 'Diane.'

'Dear 'Elan,' The wine wasn't funny. The vodka wasn't funny. You're an awful person with no compassion. I'm sorry for your family that they should have to deal with you. - Diane.'

'This means war,' he tweeted, before sending out a description of his opponent to his tens of thousands of followers.

Another note: Gale hit back with another note in which he told 'Diane' to stay home next time she was in a bad mood

Seat: He also took a photo of the woman's seat, pictured

'Diane is in her late 40s or early 50s. She is wearing mom jeans and a studded belt and she is wearing a medical mask over her idiot face,' he tweeted.

In an amusing effort, he even tweeted at US Airways in a bid to get her kicked off the flight 30,000 feet in the air.

'@USAirwaysHelp hi I find a passenger on one of your planes to be annoying. If I give you money will you remove her? I want to buy her seat,' he wrote.

But decided another note, which he said he was considering 'balling up in my mouth and spitting it into her tray table,' was his best retaliation approach.

He tweeted a picture of her seat number and then his response note before delivering it.

It read: 'Dear 'Diane,' Thank you for your lovely note. The person who lacks compassion is you. We all want to get home, particularly the nice men and women who fly your lazy ass around and serve you drinks (you're welcome!) Next time you're in a bad mood, stay home. I hate you very much. Eat my d***' Love 'Elan.'

Tit-for-tat: Diane's next note, pictured, read: '"Elan" This is inappropriate beyond belief. I will be speaking to the authorities when we land'

Rude: But the producer couldn't leave it there, and sent another note to Diane, referring again to his genitalia

Violent: In a violent twist of fate, it was Diane who may have been in trouble with the authorities when they landed

Diane shot back with her own threat. It was getting heated.

'"Elan" This is inappropriate beyond belief. I will be speaking to the authorities when we land.'

But the producer couldn't leave it there.

With the comment, 'My final (I think) note to Diane in 7A,' he posted a picture of his latest offering, 'Dear "Diane" When you speak to the authorities, please make sure they arrest you for cannibalism because you just ate my d***!' Love Elan.'

However, in a violent twist of fate, it was Diane who may have been in trouble with the authorities when they landed.

'Well, "Diane just slapped me,' Gale tweeted.

Final note: In a last note, after the slapping, Gale gave Diane his Twitter handle and told her to read all his tweets

Signing off: Signing off, Gale added once more for measure 'eat my d***'

He later explained, on his connecting flight to LAX, how it all played out.

'When I got off the plane I waited for her at the gate. I was holding another note in my hand and I was going to give it to her,' he tweeted.

'She walked right up to me and slapped me immediately in the face.'

He said the gate agent for the next flight actually grabbed her and held her back before asking Gale if he wanted the airport police called.

He said 'no,' as Diane turned to ask the same agent whether she'd make her connecting to Sacramento.

'He said "no,"' Gale tweeted. He said he laughed and the agent asked again if he wanted to call the police.

Again he said no, but he did have one last note for her.

It read: 'Diane, allow me to introduce myself. I am TheYearOfElan. Look me up online. read every tweet. Read every response. And maybe next time you'll be nice to people who are just trying to help.'

And signing off he wrote, 'PS Eat my d***. Love Elan.'
