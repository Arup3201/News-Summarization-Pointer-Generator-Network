Ole Gunnar Solksjaer could make a move for Danny Gabbidon as the Welsh international centre-back trains with Cardiff City to maintain fitness.

The Championship side are short on central defenders and Solskjaer has admitted he would like to add strength in that area before the transfer window closes.

Gabbidon, who was released by Crystal Palace in the summer, played more than 200 games for Cardiff during a five-year spell at the club before moving to West Ham for six seasons.

Solskjaer said of the 35-year-old: 'He's got to look at us and we're looking at him and you never know in football.

'But at the moment it's just about him training with us and keeping himself fit.

'I've said I want a centre-back in but I don't think it will happen before Saturday.'
