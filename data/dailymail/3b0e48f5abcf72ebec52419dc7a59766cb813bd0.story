The first Romanian to arrive in London after European border controls were relaxed has warned his fellow countrymen that life in England is difficult. 

Victor Spirescu, who was pictured as he was met at the airport in January by MP Keith Vaz, said it is hard to make money in this country, and that he would not encourage his friends or family to join him.

Border restrictions on Romanians and Bulgarians were lifted on January 1 last year – allowing migrants from the two countries to move to the UK for work.

Since then, almost 47,000 migrants have come to the UK.

Mr Spirescu, who first worked at a car wash before leaving after one day for a construction job, said: 'I don't tell them to come here. It is hard work to grow in this country, to save money. It is only if you have some luck.

'I came here to work. I came here to make money. Not for benefits,' he said.

Mr Spirescu told the Telegraph that he thinks the panic that surrounded the new border controls was unfair, singling out Ukip leader Nigel Farage for 'having a problem with immigrants. 

He said: 'He has a problem with immigrants – but he has an immigrant wife,' he said. 'He speaks lots of stupid things.'

He said: 'It is hard work to grow in this country, to save money. It is only if you have some luck'

His first job at a carwash paid him just £30 a day - but now he says he earns £250 a day in a construction job which he sends back to his parents for safekeeping

Mr Spirescu has previously told the Daily Mail that he came to the country to work, and not to claim benefits. 

His first job at a carwash paid him just £30 a day - but now he says he earns £250 a day in a construction job which he sends back to his parents for safekeeping. 

He said he is saving up the money he earns here so he can live like a king when he returns to his village in Romania. 

More than a quarter of a million Romanian and Bulgarian nationals now live in Britain – a figure that has risen by almost 50,000 over the past 12 months.

The number based here has increased more than fivefold in eight years – making up the equivalent of a city the size of Wolverhampton.

The figures, which were published by Oxford University’s respected Migration Observatory, are based on analysis of the official Labour Force Survey.

The data also shows that around one in five working-age migrants from Romania and Bulgaria are not in work – a total of 46,000. 

Arrivals from both countries have increased following the lifting of transitional border controls in January.
