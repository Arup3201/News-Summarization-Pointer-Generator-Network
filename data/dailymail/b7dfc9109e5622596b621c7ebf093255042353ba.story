White
House Press Secretary Jay Carney stumbled Friday in a routine press briefing
that turned ugly, when reporters asked why a CIA-approved set of talking points
about last year's terror attack on a U.S. diplomatic outpost in Benghazi, Libya
were edited 12 times - seemingly with the influence of Obama administration
political appointees.

Carney
took swipes at Republicans and faced hostile questions from a press corps that grew impatient with the
government's answers to questions about the Sept 11, 2012 deadly, al-Qaeda-inspired
mayhem.

Many
reporters were equally impatient with the White House Press Office, which
rescheduled the regular daily briefing twice, first holding instead a closed-door
background session with 14 selected reporters.

While Carney initially promised that he would remain in the briefing room 'as long as you want' to answer reporters' questions, he left abruptly with many hands still in the air.

White House spokesman Jay Carney denied Republican accusations of a cover-up in last year's deadly attack in Libya, trying to defuse a renewed political controversy after 12 drafts of a talking-points memo emerged, showing an attempt to omit references to Islamic terrorism in the midst of an election capmaign

Carney slammed Republican 2012 presidential candidate and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, whom he said 'put out a press release to try and take political advantage of these deaths' -- and then corrected himself: 'of the attack in Benghazi'

Terrorists
destroyed the U.S. diplomatic outpost in Benghazi during the 2012 presidential
campaign, leading Republicans to suggest that downplaying the impact of active
terrorists in Libya was a tactic to deflect concerns that the president was
weak on Islamic terrorism.

Responding
to questions about whether the Obama administration sought to avoid those
political consequences, Carney took a shot at Mitt Romney, the president's
opponent.

The
former Republican governor of Massachusetts, he said, 'put out a press release
to try and take political advantage of these deaths.'

Carney
quickly corrected himself: 'Of the attack in Benghazi.'

At
issue is language the CIA prepared for the House Permanent Select Committee on
Intelligence. Its initial draft held, in part, that 'We believe ... the attacks
in Benghazi were spontaneously inspired ... [but] we do know that Islamic
extremists with ties to al Qa'ida participated in the attack.'

Twelve
revisions later, and after emailed input from State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland, the final version issued Sept. 15 read that 'currently
available information suggests that the demonstrations in Benghazi were
spontaneously inspired ... [but] there are indications that extremists
participated in the violent demonstrations.'

All
mentions of Islamic terrorism, al-Qaeda and the 'attack' itself were scrubbed
from the talking points by the time US Secretary Susan Rice blamed the deadly
incident on an anti-Islam YouTube video, during five talk show appearances on
Sept. 16.

An Obama impeachment? Sen. Jim Inhofe (L) and Daily Beast columnist Michael Tomasky (R) are suggesting that the Benghazi scandal could lead there

Carney
held Friday to his previous statements, insisting that the intelligence
community was solely responsible for the substantive edits.

'The
CIA, in this case deputy director of the CIA ... issued a set of talking points on that Saturday morning,' Carney said, 'and those talking points were
disseminated. And the only edit made by the White House or the State Department
... was a change in referring to the facility that was attacked as a
"consulate" -- because it was not a consulate -- to "diplomatic
post."'

But
reporters questioned Carney's parsing of words, asking if the State
Department's influence was felt by the CIA, which then adapted its talking
points to suit political appointees.

Carney
said the State Department was included in the working group that edited the
CIA's draft, 'since it was a State Department facility that was attacked.'

Carney
accused unnamed Republicans of leaking a series of emails to ABC News on
Friday. Those communications, the network reported, spell out the trail of
edits across 12 separate versions of the talking points.

The
White House, he said, provided the emails in question to the U.S. Senate months
ago, in response to a request related to the confirmation of the incoming CIA
director, John Brennan.

'The
administration took the rather extraordinary step of providing those emails' to
senators 'in late February and through March,' Carney said. Senate Republicans
voted to confirm Brennan after seeing 'all of these emails which, of course,
now they've leaked to reporters.'

State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland's emails show that the agency, then headed by Hillary Clinton, had a direct hand in suggesting alterations to the official story on the Benghazi terror attack

ABC News uncovered 12 versions of the infamous Benghazi talking points, along with emails suggesting that Nuland - then Hillary Clinton's chief spokesperson - was chiefly interested in political considerations less than two months before the presidential elections

Although
Republicans have called on the White House to release unclassified versions of
all internal administration emails related to what they term a Benghazi
'cover-up,' Carney said the administration would not comply.

'Internal
deliberations are generally protected information,' he noted.

The
Freedom of Information Act includes a list of nine exceptions to government
transparency rules, including the provision that 'a privileged inter-agency or
intra-agency memorandum or letter' need not be disclosed.

But
it's unclear whether that rule applies to Congress, or whether Republicans on
Capitol Hill will drop the now-intensely politicized issue. Four Americans
perished in the terror attack on Benghazi, including then-Ambassador to Libya
Chris Stevens.

He
conceded that one feature of the talking points, its claim that spontaneous
demonstrations preceded the Benghazi terror attack, turned out to be flawed.
But reporters focused more on sins of omission on which the White House is now
referring questions to the CIA.

'You
should direct those questions to the intelligence community,' Carney said after
one journalist asked whether the CIA's first draft - which included references
to al-Qaeda - was accurate before it was edited.

These bloodstains at the main gate of the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya are believed to belong to an American staff member. Four U.S. personnel, including ambassador Chris Stevens, died in the Sept. 11, 2012 terror attack

The normally unflappable Jay Carney seemed to struggle Friday to answer questions, in a hostile briefing that was delayed twice and pushed near the end of the work day when most of the day's news cycle was over

It's
an open question whether the White House will be able to rest blame for the
ultimately flawed talking points with intelligence agencies despite the State
Department's now-documented influence over the process.

But
one reporter was heard in the press briefing room after Carney departed,
speculating about applying the press secretary's standard of responsibility to
his cooking.

'So
if I have this soup recipe that I know is great, and my wife tells me over and
over to put different things into it instead, and I do what she asks, and then
it turns out awful, whose fault is it?' the reporter, who asked not to be
named, said.

Indeed,
Carney said 'No' when asked if he could deny that the second and subsequent CIA
drafts of the Benghazi talking points came after input from the State
Department.

But
'these are talking points,' he reflected. 'Not policy.'

An early CIA draft says 'we do know' an al-Qaeda influenced group participated in the attack, but the official version omitted terror references

Key question: Did political appointees direct the CIA to change its tune so the president wouldn't look soft on terror just weeks before the election?
