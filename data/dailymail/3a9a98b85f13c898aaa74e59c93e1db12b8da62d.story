Dutch side Feyenoord want to take Marko Arnautovic on loan from Stoke City.

The Austria international has held talks with manager Mark Hughes over his lack of first-team starts this season and is keen to get his career back on track.

Hughes does not want to lose the 25-year-old but is keen to bring in another forward in the January transfer window which could push Arnautovic further down the pecking order.

Arnautovic, who fractured his arm last week but played for Austria against Russia at the weekend wearing a plaster cast, has started just four Premier League games this term and just once since August.

He said: 'It's not going the way I dreamed at the moment. I cannot say why the manager isn't picking me. I asked him what I needed to do, but that will remain between me and him.'

Arnautovic, who joined for £2million from Werder Bremen in 2013, was watched by Feyenoord's scouts at the weekend and played for the club's coach Fred Rutten at FC Twente.
