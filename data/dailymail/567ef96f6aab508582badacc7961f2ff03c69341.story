Personal: Jane Fonda opened up about her mother's suicide at the Rape Foundation Brunch at Greenacres in Beverly Hills on Sunday

Fonda said she discovered while writing her memoirs that her mother had been sexually abused as a girl.

Fonda said she reviewed her mother's medical records and discovered she had been sexually abused when she was 8 years old. Frances Ford Seymour committed suicide when Fonda was 12.

'The minute that I read that, everything fell into place,' Fonda said from a small stage set up in Burkle's sprawling backyard. 'I knew why the promiscuity, the endless plastic surgery, the guilt, the inability to love or be intimate, and I was able to forgive her and forgive myself.'

Fonda explained that learning this helped her understand some of her mother's behavior before her ultimate suicide when Fonda was 12. 

She said sexual violence is ‘epidemic’ vowing, ‘I will support the Rape Treatment Center for the rest of my life.’

Lily Tomlin introduced Fonda, her ‘9 to 5’ co-star and longtime friend. David Schwimmer and Eric McCormack also spoke during the luncheon, where guests included Viola Davis, Emmy Rossum and Sam Waterson.

Gail Abarbanel, founder of the Rape Treatment Center and president of the Rape Foundation, introduced several rape survivors, including the mother of the victim of the 2012 Steubenville High School assault in Ohio. She noted her daughter’s bravery in pressing charges against her attackers — beloved star football players who had the support of the community.

Schwimmer and McCormack asked the deep-pocketed in the crowd for their support, and five people — including Burkle — spontaneously gave $100,000 to help the Rape Treatment Center continue to offer free medical, psychological and legal services to children and adults.

The Rape Foundation also provides free training for first responders and sexual assault prevention programs nationwide.

The Barbarella star was her usual stylish self while at the event in a lilac tunic with dolman sleeves and a peplum with an asymmetric hem at the hip, decorated with a gold bar across her perfectly flat tummy. 

She teamed it with matching trousers and peep toe shoes.

The double Oscar-winning actress carried a small silver clutchbag and accessorised with a short necklace of square, amber-coloured stones.

Her layered blonde tresses framed her face, which was delicately made up with a hint of pink blush and lipstick that exactly matched the colour of her outfit.

The star met up with an old friend and fellow septuagenarian at the event, actress Lily Tomlin.

The brunette, who also looked much younger than her 76 years, wore a black, short-sleeved blouse and trousers with a diaphanous jacket over the top.

Nearly one in five women in the U.S. has been raped, 80% before the age of 25, while one in six boys is sexually abused before the age of 18, according to the Rape Foundation.

Founded in 1989, the organisation brings state-of-the-art care to rape victims and sexually abused children, provides prevention programs to reduce the incidence of these crimes and trains victim service providers to enhance the treatment victims receive wherever they turn to the Foundation for help.
