Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger insists Joel Campbell will not leave the Emirates in January.

Campbell has struggled to get time in the Barclays Premier League and was rumoured to be on his way out of Arsenal  with Southampton and Inter Milan circling.

But Wenger will not allow that to happen, declaring Campbell not for sale after the 21-year-old striker played 90 minutes in Arsenal's 4-1 win against Galatasaray in the Champions League.

'Campbell will stay with us,' Wenger told Arsenal's official website.

Meanwhile, Lukas Podolski is also rumoured to be on his way out.

The Germany striker has been given limited time on the pitch to prove himself, though his two goals against Galatasaray helped his cause. Like Campbell, he is out of contract in 2016.

'It is a competition for places that is difficult,' added Wenger. 'I had (Danny) Welbeck, (Alexis) Sanchez and (Olivier) Giroud at home and you can only play a certain number of strikers.

'He came back later from the World Cup but he is now coming back to a very strong level.'
