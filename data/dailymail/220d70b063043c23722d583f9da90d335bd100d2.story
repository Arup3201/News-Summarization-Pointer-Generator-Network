James Wilkinson who died on a military training exercise in Kenya where he was apparently shot in the neck.

A British soldier whose wife is expecting their first child was shot dead in an apparent training ground accident, it was revealed today.

James Wilkinson, 21, died on a military training exercise in Kenya where he was apparently shot in the neck.

His wife Sarah, who is seven months' pregnant, is still waiting for the Army to give full details surrounding his death on November 26.

Fusilier James Wilkinson served with the 2nd Battalion of the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers.

He was on a six-week exercise in 
Kenya and had been scheduled to be reunited with his wife, who lives in 
Radcliffe, Bury, Greater Manchester, on December 17.

Mrs Wilkinson was told of the tragedy on Saturday, hours after the fatal shooting incident. 

But yesterday she said she was upset the Fusiliers had not made a public announcement about her husband’s death.

She said: ‘They are doing everything they can for me. I don’t want the news about James’s death to be swept under the carpet.

‘I was told James had been shot in the neck while on exercise in Kenya. The Army said it was an accident, but I have not been told enough. I don’t think it’s sunk in yet.’

Fusilier Wilkinson was born into a serving Army family in Germany and lived in various locations.

Three years ago, he settled in Whitefield where his parents, Jan and Rob, still live. He joined the Army a year ago before undergoing his basic training in Catterick North Yorkshire.

Fusilier Wilkinson and his wife met about two years ago, and they were married at St Thomas and St John Church, Radcliffe, at the end of July.

Mrs Wilkinson is scheduled to arrive back in the UK today.

When asked about Mr Wilkinson's death, a spokesman for the regiment said: ‘We are aware of an incident of that nature. An investigation is under way.’

An MOD spokesperson said: “We regret to confirm that Fusilier James Wilkinson, who was serving with the 2nd Battalion The Royal Regiment of Fusiliers, died following an incident in Kenya on 26th November. Our thoughts are with his family at this difficult and sad time.

'As an organisation of approximately 172,000 service personnel we unfortunately deal with a number of deaths that occur whilst our personnel are not deployed on operations. For these tragic incidents there is a slightly different process, but one which is no less respectful and dignified and provides support to the family.'
