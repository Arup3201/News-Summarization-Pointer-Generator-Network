Quizzed: A handout picture released by the Syrian Arab News Agency shows President Bashar al-Assad speaking during the interview

Amid the sound of shell fire, defiant Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad has told the West he will not step down.

In a rare interview conducted in the library of the presidential palace in Damascus, he warned America and Russia that peace talks were no nearer the negotiating table.

Assad accused western powers of wanting to topple his brutal regime and exacerbating violence.

When asked if he would resign as the civil war tearing apart his country entered its third year, he said: 'Any decisions about reforms in Syria will come from Syria and neither the U.S. nor any other state can intervene.

'In any case, to resign would be to flee.'

Speaking to the Argentinian newspaper Clarin who shared it with the Observer, Assad said there were too many separate rebel opposition groups to make a ceasefire work.

Moscow and Washington hope talks could take place at the end of the month, but Assad doubts that will happen

He said: 'Who can unify thousands of people? We can't discuss a timetable with a party if we don't know who they are?'

The Free Syrian Army is the leading military opposition, but now there are regionally warlords, militias and Al-qeada groups vying for power.

 'This is a fight to the death for 
the Sunnis,' Abu Hamza, a commander of a Free Syrian Army-linked brigade
in Idlib province told the Observer.

'The regime has fired at least 200 
ballistic missiles into the north against civilian areas. And the world 
wonders why we attack their villages? They are trying to eradicate us. 
We must get to them first.'

The embattled president accused Saudi 
Arabia, Qatar and Turkey of backing the opposition groups and demanded 
the end of their support before talks could take place.

He denied claims his forces have used chemical weapons, but said the allegations could be used by the West to intervene in the conflict.

Assad is quoted in the Observer: 'The west lies and falsifies evidence to engineer wars, it is a habit of theirs. Of course, any war against Syria would not be easy, it wouldn't be a simple excursion.'

He denied his troops had used excessive force. 'How does one define excessive force? The issue really centres on the nature and extent of the terrorism we have suffered, and thus, what is a proper response.'
