A 15-year-old boy sentenced to 45 years behind bars for shooting his sister dead while she slept 'always hated' the A-grade student, one of his friends has revealed.

No motive has previously been given for why Colton Harvey shot dead his 16-year-old sister Candace, a basketball player and beauty queen, in their rural Arkansas home in January this year.

But now police interviews obtained by the Associated Press have shed light on why the boy was led to murder - with his parents adding he was mad at them and 'knew this would kill us'.

'Bitter': Colton Harvey, who shot his sister dead while she slept, 'always hated' her, a friend has said

After Harvey shot his sister, he went
to a friend's home and told him about the murder, before turning 
himself in to sheriffs. The friend told police Harvey was bitter about 
his sister being the 'golden child'.

'He's always said that he hated his 
sister, but he wasn't ever saying nothing about he was gonna kill his 
sister,' the unidentified teenager told authorities in February.

He said that Candace would snitch on her brother and always got what she wanted, while Harvey 'just got kicked off to the side'.

'I guess he finally got tired of it one day and went off,' the friend said.

Harvey's mother has also shed light 
on the killer's state of mind at the time of the shooting, suggesting he
was angry at his parents for grounding him for chewing tobacco.

Candace had not been in the house 
that weekend as she had a ballgame and work. But her brother was left 
alone to pick up rocks as his punishment and stew in his room.

Then on January 15, the Harveys woke 
the boy to tend some jerky from the deer he had shot the previous 
weekend as they went grocery shopping.

After they left, he grabbed his father's
gun and pointed it at his sister's forehead as she lay in bed and 
fired. She woke up with a scream and he shot her twice more in the head.

'I think that he just wanted to hurt 
me and his father and he knew this would kill us,' his mother said, 
according to the state police report.

In other interviews, his mother had told investigators the two teenagers never fought.

Prosecutor
David Gibbons said: 'No signs that would alert somebody that this would
happen, no quarrels, no fussing and fighting.'

Harvey then took a bag of clothes, 
ammunition and deodorant and jumped in his father's truck to drive 
towards the hills, but then turned around for the sheriff's office.

But before he told authorities about 
his crime, he left and went to his friend's house and confessed to the 
murder. 'I thought he was just messing with me,' his friend said in his 
interview.

Harvey was initially charged with 
first-degree murder, which carries a maximum penalty of life without 
parole, but they worked out a plea bargain with his attorney and he was 
sentenced to 45 years.

The boy cried as he addressed the 
judge, at one point raising his cuffed hands to his face so he could
dab his eyes with a tissue.

Anger: Harvey's mother has also revealed she had grounded the teen the weekend he shot his sister for chewing tobacco and may have killed his sister to get to his parents

The scrawny, blonde teenager appeared in court with his feet shackled as he told Judge William Pearson he used a rifle to kill his sister.

The judge asked: 'You stated that you murdered your sister. Is that correct?'

Harvey whispered: 'Yes, sir.'

Pearson sentenced Harvey to 30 years 
for second-degree murder plus 15 more because he used a gun. Prosecutors
initially charged Harvey with first-degree murder which has a maximum 
penalty of life in prison. He could be up for parole in 12 years, depending on good behavior.

The sheriff said the boy seemed remorseful and had tears in his eyes when he turned himself in.

Investigators
found the girl's body in her bedroom at the family's home near Ozark, a
town of around 3,600 people, 120 miles northwest of Little Rock.

Innocence: Candace Harvey's mother sobbed in court today as she watched her son sentenced to 45 years for her murder

Prosecutor David Gibbons said: 'He never did
give what I would consider to be a clear motive.'

Harvey's
attorney, Bill James, said there was a history of mental illness in the
family. However an expert wasn't able to give a diagnosis because of 
Colton's young age.

Mr James added: 'Every time I've ever
seen him, he's cried. And it's not, ''Woe is me.'' It's about what he's
done to his mom and what he's done to his family.'

Local
sheriff Anthony Boen said at the time of Harvey's arrest that deputies 
had never been called to the home and there weren't any reports of 
trouble with the teenagers.
