Unhappy: A family have caught their postman urinating on their doorstep after months of finding puddles outside their Exeter home (posed by model)

A postman is facing disciplinary action for repeatedly urinating on a couple's doorstep while on his daily round.

The delivery worker regularly left a puddle outside the home of Luke Osborne, 27, and partner Keyleigh Rawlings, 23, making them believe their front door was being targeted by drunks.

After months of attacks the couple were left so bemused they decided to hide in the hallway so they could find out who was weeing on their steps.

Mr Osborne waited for his mail to drop one morning then quietly opened the front door - to find the brazen Royal Mail worker relieving himself.

He has now complained to post office bosses who said the culprit would face 'internal disciplinary measures'.

Mr Osborne of Exeter, Devon, said: 'For months now my partner and I have been having to walk through urine on our front steps.

'The entrance to our flat is secluded with steps up to the front door. I had thought at first it might be late night drunks, but then drunks don't return to the same spot day after day to relieve themselves.

'When I went out there he was, full frontal, relieving himself. I couldn't believe it. This is the Royal Mail, they deliver in the Queen's name and there he was relieving himself on my front step.'

Probe: Royal Mail in Exeter, Devon, (pictured) say they have launched an internal investigation

Royal Mail said it had launched a probe into the postie's antics.

Spokesman Val Bodden said: 'Royal Mail expects the highest standards of behaviour from our people while out on deliveries and collections and this individual will now face internal disciplinary measures.'
