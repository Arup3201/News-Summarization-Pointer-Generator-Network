Behind enemy lines: Captain Cecil Leyland Riding MC parachuted into Nazi-occupied France, it was revealed in a basket full of his wartime memorabilia

The family of Cecil Leyland Riding already knew he was a war hero.

He had, after all, been awarded the Military Cross for gallantry during World War Two.

But what they didn't know was the true extent of his exploits, until now - thanks to the contents of a picnic basket found in his attic.

The hamper, full of medals, coded maps, memoirs and photographs, has revealed that Captain Riding was in fact a founding member of the SAS.

The documents show how, just days after D-Day, the 28-year-old was parachuted behind enemy lines into Nazi-occupied France - with a carrier pigeon strapped to his chest.

Among his covert missions was the time he blew up train lines outside of Paris.

Captain Riding described how he often had to pretend to be German to evade the enemy while he sent intelligence back to London.

His incredible stories and the many medals he was awarded for courage and bravery were found in the hamper, along with his uniform, in his home in Dumfries, Galloway after his death.

David Riding, nephew of Captain Riding, said the basket's contents told the real story of the heroism he never spoke of himself.

He said: ‘Cecil never talked about his wartime exploits. I knew he had been awarded the Military Cross but had no idea of the details.

‘After Cecil's death, we found the memorabilia in a trunk in his loft and could piece together the story from what was there.

‘It's amazing what these young men achieved.’

Captain Riding grew up near Lockerbie, working at a factory before moving to Glasgow where he met his wife Janie.

When the war broke out, Captain Riding had been working at Garscube House near Glasgow.

The estate was requisitioned by the Ministry of Works for War Use and in 1940 he joined the Coldstream Guards.

A year later he was commissioned into the Highland Light Infantry.

Captain Riding was one of the first 36 members of the Special Air Service (SAS) when it was formed in 1941.

He was parachuted into France just three days after the Normandy Landings in 1944.

Stories kept silent: Captain Riding never spoke of his incredible story but his family have pieced together his involvement in the war using the contents of the basket which included a collection of maps

He remained there on special duty behind the enemy lines for three months as part of Operation Gain.

Leading a team of five men, he was responsible for blowing up the Montarges to Paris train line.

His missions were often fraught with danger and he escaped death on two occasions when German troops discovered the SAS camps and obliterated them.

In one of the attacks, his commanding officer and two fellow soldiers were killed.

He was also part of the Allied advance into Germany across the Rhine Frontier in March and April of 1945 and was also involved in Operation Doomsday, part of the liberation of Norway.

For his service to the war effort, he was awarded five medals for his heroics including the prestigious Military Cross for ‘gallantry during active operations against the enemy’.

He was also awarded The Star, The France and Germany Star, The Defence Medal and the War Medal.

A coded silk handkerchief was also among the items found in Captain Riding's attic. Silk handkerchiefs were used by the Allies during WWII for coding and maps for troops and pilots to evade capture.

After finishing his service, Captain Riding returned to Scotland, living near Strathdon, Aberdeenshire before taking up a post with Bombay Burma Trading Company in 1956.

Along with wife Janie, the couple lived in Borneo and Burma for a number of years where he worked in forestry.

They returned to Scotland in 1967 and Captain Riding worked for Falkirk District Council as a land valuation officer.

He moved to Dumfries in 1971 and lived there until he died in 1998.

The family have handed the basket into the Dumfries Museum where it has been turned into a major exhibition.

Fiona Wilson, museum officer, said: ‘On first seeing the basket it was clear that this was a fascinating collection, there were so many different objects which fitted together to tell one person's story.

‘The objects that he chose to keep tell us so much about his time in the SAS and what was happening in France and Germany during that period of World War II.

‘Sometimes all that is kept are a soldier's medals but here we have Cecil's personal account of his experiences and so much more.’
