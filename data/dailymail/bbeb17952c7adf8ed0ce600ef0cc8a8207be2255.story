The original cast from TLC's hit show Breaking Amish, have returned - all except Katie - to their roots in Pennsylvania and the first episode of the brand new season premieres on Sunday.

Fans of the drama-filled first series won't be disappointed if TLC's Return to Amish sneak peak trailer is anything to go by, particularly on the new baby front, as both Rebecca, 20, and Sabrina, 25, are pregnant.

Rebecca and Abe's first child, a daughter who, according to many reports, they notoriously conceived before the Breaking Amish cameras started rolling back in 2012 - long before they apparently 'met' for the first time in season one - also seems to make an appearance, having been previously absent from the show.

Elsewhere in the trailer, Sabrina is seen experiencing some bizarre food cravings and both she and Rebecca are rushed to hospital on separate occasions.

In one clip, the outspoken Sabrina, who was adopted into her Amish family as an infant, says to Mary, the show's matriarch figure: 'You've had a lot of kids. I heard that your ****** gets really floppy.'

There also appears to be an emotional fallout from the alleged hook up between Rebecca, who is now adjusting to married life with husband Abe following their return from New York, and his very own brother Andrew.

Katie, 23, who, in a shock move, has not returned to base camp and is instead in New York perusing a raunchy career as a model, makes only a brief appearance in the trailer, but her presence is certainly felt back home.

'Tell me in a year from now she's not going to be a porn star,' says Jeramiah, pointing to a newspaper advert of his former chum, clad in lacy underwear.

'All we ever do is sit around and bitch about Katie all day and I'm getting tired of it,' argues Sabrina in a separate clip.

Tensions also appear to be running high when one new cast member busts Andrew for having a cell phone, throwing (and breaking) it in a rage.

Self-confessed 'rebel' Jeremiah's love life is also highlighted throughout the series, as is Mary's ongoing struggles with being shunned by the community.

And as Andrew is newly released from jail for a 2013 marijuana conviction, he appears to be trying to mend his relationship with his family - a work in progress at best.

Return to Amish is a spin-off of the original first series of Breaking Amish, which saw the five young Anabaptist adults - four Amish and one Mennonite - leave their sheltered community and experience the bright lights of New York city.

At the end of their stay, all the cast members were documented struggling with the decision of whether or not to return to the communities in which they grew up, or brave the modern world alone.

The show's second season, Breaking Amish: Brave new world followed an entirely different cast on their trip to Florida, and those characters will not be featured in Return to Amish.

Breaking Amish, which averaged about three million 
viewers in its first season, has repeatedly come under fire following revelations which have thrown its 'reality' status into question.

While each cast member originally claimed to have grown up in the strict communities, plenty of evidence has surfaced suggesting they all have decidedly dark pasts - involving divorce, children and time away from the faith.

And with the exception of Rebecca and Sabrina - who have both been married and divorced before the show begun - every member of the Breaking Amish cast has a police record.

The two-hour premiere of Return to Amish begins on Sunday at 9/8c with a holiday reunion.
