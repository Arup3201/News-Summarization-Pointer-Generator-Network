The parents of a 15-month-old child who weighted only 9lb when she died, have been arrested in connection with her death.

Ernest Ingram, and Denise Snow-Ingram, who are both 38, told police they had never taken their daughter to see a doctor because of religious beliefs.

The tiny girl died at a children's hospital on Wednesday morning, after an ambulance was called to the parents' Phoenix home after reports of a child not breathing.

Arrest: Ernest and Denise Ingram have been charged with count of child abuse each over the girl's death

Her parents were arrested on child abuse charges on Wednesday. As well as being malnourished, the toddler had several fractures to her ribs, Phoenix police told Az Central.

A healthy weight for a 15-month-old girl is about 22lb but the child weighed 9lb - the same as some newborns.

The Ingrams told police they were the only people to have ever looked after the child, who had not seen a doctor since her birth because of their religious beliefs, Fox 10 reported.

They have not yet stated what their religion is.

When they appeared in court today, where they were each charged with one count of child abuse, Mrs Ingram denied that they had harmed any of their seven children.

She said: 'We have never committed a felony, any type of anything as far as criminal activity before, and also we need the opportunity to be able to collect evidence to show, to prove that we didn't do ... what we are being accused of.'

Investigation: Police vehicles can be seen at the couple's Phoenix home, where they lived with seven children

Prosecutors claimed that the girl's low weight contributed to her death, according to KTAR. A post-mortem examination was due to take place on Thursday.

The couple remain in jail on a $250,000 bond.

'They have claimed it is their religious right to raise their kids as they please,' Sergeant Trent Crump of Phoenix police, said.

He added that the parents had been the sole carer for the child and believed she had been developing slowly.

There was no record of police calling at the couple's home before the death of their child, and Sergeant Crump said the house did not appear to be uninhabitable.

He added that the 'living standard is not something at this point that we're looking at as being a factor in all this'.

Abuse charge: Paramedics were called to the Phoenix home after the 15-month-old girl stopped breathing

Police were first alerted to the child's welfare after paramedics received a call of child not breathing.

The toddler was rushed to Phoenix Children's Hospital at about 10am on Wednesday, but she died.

Six other children, aged between 3 and 12, who lived in the same house have been removed. They did not appear to be harmed in any way, but will be examined by doctors.
