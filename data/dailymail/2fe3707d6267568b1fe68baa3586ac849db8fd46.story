Moeen Ali’s Gaza protest provoked a double-edged backlash on Tuesday.

The England all-rounder wore wristbands saying ‘Save Gaza’ and ‘Free Palestine’ while batting on Monday in the third Investec Test.

He was warned on Tuesday not to wear them again by the International Cricket Council — despite the ECB believing he had breached no protocols.

However, there was a growing feeling on Tuesday night that fellow Muslim cricketers were ready to defy the authorities by playing in similar wristbands.

Former Pakistan all-rounder Azhar Mahmood vowed to wear a similar band when he plays for Surrey in their T20 Blast quarter-final against Worcestershire on Saturday at The Oval.

Moeen’s cousin Kabir Ali, who played 14  one-day internationals and a Test for England between 2003 and 2006, described the ICC’s decision to sanction Moeen as an ‘absolute joke’. 

Moeen — a devout Muslim who wears a beard as a mark of his faith — enjoyed a good day in the field, taking two key wickets as England reduced India to 323 for eight.

Others had less sympathy for Ali, who received a stinging rebuke from former England bowler Steve Harmison for making a political statement while representing his country.

‘He’s been a silly boy,’ Harmison said. ‘He’s a cricketer, it’s a cricket field and he shouldn’t be wearing that. He has been a bit silly and naive.

‘If he wants to do it away from the field, that’s fine, nobody has any problems with that. To do it on the field is a dangerous thing to do.’

An ICC spokesman said: ‘The regulations do not permit the display of messages that relate to political, religious or racial activities or causes during an international match.

‘Moeen is not permitted to wear the wristbands on the field of play in an international.’
