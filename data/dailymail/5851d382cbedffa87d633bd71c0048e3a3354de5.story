A former forklift truck driver is set to retire two years early after undergoing a sex-change operation.

Lizi Ninnim, who was born Roger, qualifies for early retirement since she became a woman 12 months ago.

But she says: 'I wouldn't recommend it as an easy route to an early pension - it would make your eyes water.'

Six-foot Lizi, of Clacton, Essex, had counselling and lived as a woman for four years before the sex-change op.

Now her birth certificate has been legally changed to say she was born female.

The ruling means Lizi, 63, can retire two years earlier than if she were still a man.

Lizi consulted her workmates at the Range furniture store before the sex change, and every member of staff backed the move.

She said: 'I went to work one day as a male, had the weekend off, and on Monday I went in as a woman. The old Roger even had a leaving bash.

'They bought me a present saying goodbye to Roger and had a leaving do for him. Then on the Monday they had a welcome party for Lizi.'

Although she describes Clacton as 'not the most understanding town', she says customers at the shop where she is now a manager have accepted her.

'It doesn't bother me if people make comments,' she added. 'I've never regretted what I've done.

'I wish there was a way of not hurting people but sadly it's not possible without destroying yourself, so what can you do?

'People just need to understand you're not weird - you were just born in the wrong body.'

Roger struggled with his identity for years before 'coming out' to his wife in 2000.

Lizi said: 'She knew something was going on because she found make-up on my clothes... on the inside.

'She struggled with it for a few years and then we parted company after 35 years of marriage.'

Lizi's grown-up children also found it difficult to get to grips with the revelation, but she insists she made the right choice.
