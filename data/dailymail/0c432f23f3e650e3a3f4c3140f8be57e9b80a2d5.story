Mr O'Leary insisted the erotic movies would be visible only on personal devices, rather than screened on the back of Ryanair plane seats

The boss of budget airline Ryanair wants to launch a pay-per-view pornography service for passengers to watch during flights, it has been claimed.

Ryanair chief Michael O'Leary said he hopes to launch an app for the airline where travellers can watch sex scenes on their iPads or smartphones while in the air.

The planned service would also allow Ryanair passengers to gamble and play games, as well as watch erotic movies, according to The Sun.

Mr O'Leary told the paper: 'I'm not talking about having it on screens on the back of seats for everyone to see. It would be on handheld devices.

'Hotels around the world have it, so why wouldn't we?'

But the move raises the prospect of passengers watching porn films with children sitting barely feet away.

Ryanair said the pornography plans would take at least a year to introduce on their flights, as establishing a cost-effective way of having a solid broadband connection on their planes would be a major obstacle.

It is not the first controversial proposal for the airline from its outspoken chief executive.

Last month he said he was looking at removing all but one toilet from his planes to put in extra seats. While he has previously proposed charging passengers for using the toilet in-flight.

The latest brainwave from the budget airline boss was revealed as Ryanair bucked airline industry gloom by raising its full-year net profit forecasts by 10 per cent to £377m.

The airline, which carried 75m passengers last year, raised its guidance despite a 37 per cent surge in jet fuel prices to £778m during the first six months of the year.
