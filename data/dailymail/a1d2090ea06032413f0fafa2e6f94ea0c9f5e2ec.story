Nancy Dell'Olio is reportedly secretly dating Mark Shand, brother of Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall.

The Strictly Come Dancing star is said to have struck up a friendship with Mr Shand, 62, and has apparently flown to America to see him this week.

Ms Dell'Olio  - a former girlfriend of ex-England boss Sven-Göran Eriksson - met conservationist Mr Shand after being introduced by socialite Basia Briggs in 2012, the Sun on Sunday reports.

A friend of the Italian lawyer, 52, told the paper: 'Nancy thinks he is a real gentleman — they are both enjoying the topsecret liaison.'

The paper claims that they started seeing each other romantically at the end of last year, and that they were 'openly hugging and kissing' at a recent party hosted by Ms Briggs.

Ms Dell'Olio was seen meeting Camilla at Clarence House last July, at an event for Mr Shand's Elephant Family charity.

Father-of-one Mr Shand is said to have split from his actress wife Clio Goldsmith in 2009.

Since Ms Dell'Olio's high profile relationship with Sven-Göran Eriksson, she has dated theatre and film director Sir Trevor Nunn briefly in 2011.

It is said that Mr Shand has 'sworn her to secrecy'.

The MailOnline has contacted representatives for Ms Dell'Olio and Mr Shand.
