The French prime minister has hit back at stinging criticism of his country by John Lewis boss Andy Street - by suggesting the department boss was drunk.

Mr Street said last week that France was 'hopeless and downbeat' and described the Paris train station Gare du Nord as 'the squalor pit of Europe'.

But during a visit to Britain, French premier Manuel Valls described the remarks as 'absurd' and suggested the retail boss had 'drunk too much beer'.

Mr Street has since apologised for last week's comments, in which he urged those with investments there to 'get them out quickly' 

On an official visit to the UK, during which he met David Cameron, Mr Valls lambasted the British trait of 'French bashing', which he described as 'not particularly pleasant'.

Singling out Mr Street - though refusing to name him - the French prime minister said: 'This business leader has had to apologise. He made some absurd statements. 

'Perhaps he’d drunk too much beer. He announced an investment in France and then said France is finished. 

'One has to show a bit of respect.' 

But he did acknowledge the light-hearted nature of the John Lewis boss's attack.

Mr Street's comments, at an event marking the end of a John Lewis competition for start-ups, came after he had been in Paris to collect an award for the business at the World Retail Congress.

He said: 'You get on Eurostar from something I can only describe as the squalor pit of Europe, Gare du Nord, and you get off at a modern, forward-looking station [St Pancras].

‘I have never been to a country more ill at ease… nothing works and worse, nobody cares about it.’ 

Mr Street also said that the award he had been given was 'made of plastic and is frankly revolting'.

'If I needed any further evidence of a country in decline, here it is. Every time I [see it], I shall think, God help France.

'If you've got any investments in French business, get them out quickly.'

But after the remarks were publicised, the 50-year-old Oxford graduate, who joined John Lewis from university 30 years ago, was forced to backtrack in a statement issued by John Lewis.

He said: 'The remarks I made were supposed to be lighthearted views, and tongue in cheek. On reflection I clearly went too far. 

'I regret the comments, and apologise unreservedly.' 

But the apology came too late to avoid a response from the French embassy, which said: ‘France is the fifth biggest economy in the world... so obviously many foreign businesses do not seem to share Mr Street’s view.’

France is John Lewis' second biggest market and it is about to open a French website.

City grandee Lord Levene said Mr Street’s comments were ‘very silly’ and ‘mindless’. The high profile businessman and former Lord Mayor of London added: ‘It’s completely inappropriate for someone running a big company to do this. It doesn’t matter whether the criticism is right or wrong.’

But Mr Street’s comments struck a chord with some in the business community, who believe the 75 per cent tax on top earners introduced by Socialist president Francois Hollande and the country’s labour laws – including a 35-hour week – have stunted the economy.

This morning John Lewis said it would be making no further comment on the matter.
