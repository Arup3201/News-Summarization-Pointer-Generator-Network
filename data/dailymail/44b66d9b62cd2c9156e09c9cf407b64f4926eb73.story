HMS President (1918), one of the last remaining First World War warships, has been transformed with a 'camouflage' paint job by a German artist to mark the centenary of the start of the conflict.

The anti-submarine ship's makeover was inspired by dazzle camouflage, in which glaring colours and geometric shapes were used to mislead enemy U-boat captains during the First World War.

Artist and sculptor Tobias Rehberger transformed the boat, which is permanently moored on the Thames, near the Victoria Embankment, as part of the 14-18 NOW project, a cultural programme commemorating the war.

Also called razzle dazzle, or dazzle painting, dazzle camouflage was used not to conceal British and American ships, but to make it difficult for the enemy to estimate their range, speed and route.

Each ship was given a different dazzle pattern so that German attackers would struggle to determine the class of vessel.

As one of the last three surviving First World War Royal Navy warships, HMS President (1918) was itself 
painted in dazzle camouflage during the conflict, when it was 
deployed as a submarine hunter tracking down German U-boats.

Designer: Rehberger, who has used similar visual techniques in his previous works, has designed a new unique pattern for the ship, which was revealed today

Dazzle camouflage, used during the First World War, was an example of the collaboration of art with national defence.

Inspired
 by cubist and vorticist artworks, painter Norman Wilkinson proposed 
painting ships with jagged stripes and lines in a bid to cut down on the
 number lost to the Germans.

Although the camouflage did not actually disguise the ships, it distorted their shape when seen from far away.

This
 made it harder for the Germans to work out how fast they were sailing 
and in which direction, reducing the accuracy of their guns. 

A
 total of 2,000 ships from the Royal Navy and the U.S. fleet were 
repainted in a dazzle design in 1917 and 1918, with each one being 
unique so the Germans could not identify classes of ship by their 
markings.

The camouflage fell out of favour by the 1940s, because it was rendered useless by the introduction of radar.

Dazzle camouflage was originally inspired by modernist artworks, making it a poignant choice for the national art project. 

Now Rehberger, who has used similar visual techniques in his previous works, has designed a new unique pattern for the ship, which was revealed today.

'One of the most 
respected European artists of his generation, Rehberger is a German 
sculptor whose work blurs the boundaries between design, sculpture, 
furniture-making and installation,' said a 14-18 Now spokesman.

'These eye-catching vessels remind 
local people and visitors of the crucial role ships played in the 
country’s wartime survival.'

HMS President (1918) was one of two ships given a dazzle makeover as part of the project, which aims to acknowlege the contribution made by artists during the war.

The other vessel is the historic pilot ship, the Edmund Gardner, which is docked in Liverpool, and has been decorated by Venezuelan artist Carlos Cris-Diez.

'Perceptions of the war have been shaped 
to a great extent by the artists of the time, including poets, writers, 
painters, sculptors, photographers and film-makers, many of whom served,
 and who reflected on the war and its effects,' said the spokesman. 

'Their work had a profound and lasting impact.

'Now,
 one hundred years later, we are inviting contemporary artists from the 
UK and around the world to explore the resonance of the First World War 
today.'

Other 
initiatives run by 14-18 NOW include a letter-writing project and an 
hour's darkness across the UK on the night of the centenary.

The
 Lights Out project is inspired by then foreign secretary Sir Edward 
Grey’s remark at the outbreak of the war that: ‘The lamps are going out 
all over Europe, we shall not see them lit again in our lifetime.’  

People
 will be asked to turn off their lights between 10pm and 11pm on August 4 and replace them with either a 
candle or a specially commissioned digital light which will be available
 to download for free.  

A
 commemorative late-night prom at the Royal Albert Hall will see German 
composer Torsten Rasch and the Philharmonia Orchestra perform a 
40-minute work featuring verse by writers including Robert Frost, Edward
 Thomas and Rupert Brooke.  

Members
 of the public have been invited to write a 'letter to an unknown 
soldier', inspired by a statue at Paddington station of a serviceman 
reading a letter.
