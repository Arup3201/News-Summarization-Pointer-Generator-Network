After seven years spent fighting over a will, something had to give.

For Tony McGuire that something was the walls of the house he and his two siblings had inherited from their father.

In front of astonished neighbours, he took a sledgehammer to the £300,000 property and reduced much of it to rubble.

Police were called but were powerless 
to stop him destroying the four-bedroom home. Standing in the rubble, 
the 49-year-old electrician said: ‘I did what I had to do. This has been
going on for seven years and I’ve had enough.’

He had moved into the Cardiff property with wife Darriel and six children following the death of his father in 2005.

The couple say they poured their 
savings into extending the property only for it to emerge that his 
brother Terry and sister Tina had an equal share in it. Terry appears to
have started eviction

How it was: The £300,000 semi lived in by Tony McGuire and his family before he took a sledgehammer to it

Last week Mr McGuire demolished the extensions and garage he himself built at an estimated cost of £200,000.

‘Terry’s going to be quite bitter 
about what has happened because he will have lost money,’ he said. ‘He 
is not going to be calm at all. My sister is going to be livid as well.’

Mrs McGuire, 50, said: ‘We put all our money into the house and were then told we were being evicted by Tony’s brother.

‘It was not nice to smash up our home but I back Tony all the way.’

Terry McGuire later turned up at the 
property and said: ‘This whole situation has blown up in the last couple
of days. That is all I know until my solicitor gets back to me and 
tells me what the hell is going on. I’m not very good to say the least.’

Neighbours came out of their houses to see what the noise was when Mr McGuire, left, attacked the house

Their sister was said to be shocked.

Stuart Rogers, who lives on the other 
side of the semi, yesterday told how he had dashed outside to see his 
neighbour swinging the sledgehammer. ‘Slates were flying off the roof. I
said, “Tony, what are you doing?”,’ he said.

‘It’s like something out of EastEnders, Emmerdale and Coronation Street all mixed into one.’

Cardiff councillor Fenella Bowden said
she had been called in by worried residents: ‘Tony McGuire was up on 
the roof of the garage of the property smashing it down. It almost looks
as if there has been an explosion. If you are going to demolish a 
building it is always wise to speak to the planning department first. On
Monday he did register a request to demolish. There seems to be a 
dispute over the ownership of the property.’

Dream home in ruins: The £300,000 Cardiff home looked like a bombsite after Mr McGuire had finished

A police spokesman said: ‘It appears 
there is a civil dispute   and police officers are investigating. Nobody
has been arrested for any offence.’

Ministry of Justice figures show a 700 per cent rise in High Court inheritance actions in five years.

Experts linked the surge to the 
recession, which has left relatives inheriting less than they expected. 
As a result, families are left ‘fighting over the scraps’.

Lawyers also cited  social changes 
such as family breakdown. Remarriage and the growth in second families 
mean there are more potential inheritors.

The number of cases asking for a will to be completely overturned rose from 73 in 2006 to 135 in 2011.
