It is usually used for helping insomniacs get some much-needed sleep.

But in a miraculous twist, Ambien is believed to have woken up 23-year-old Sam Goddard after he suffered a series of strokes that left him in a coma.

Sam, from Brisbane, Australia, was playing football in February 2010 when his head began to pound so severely he screamed for an ambulance.

Unknown cause: Sam Goddard, 24, from Brisbane, Australia, suffered eight strokes in February 2010.
 Doctors believed he would be in a vegetative state for the rest of his 
life - but he has stunned them by speaking

Doctors told his family and fiancée, Sally Jane Nielson, he had suffered a staggering eight strokes, leaving him with permanent brain damage.

They warned the family Sam, now 24, would be in a vegetative state for the rest of his life, Sally told MSNBC’s Rock Center.

‘They said he would be a vegetable,’ she recounted. ‘There was actually a doctor that told us that we would be better off letting Sam contract an infection, put him in a home and just let him die.’

Sam would never be able to walk, talk or recognise his loved ones, and would likely be blind, doctors said.

Plans: Sam and his fiancee Sally Jane Nielson were supposed to marry in May - three months after the strokes

Active: Sam Goddard was healthy and fit - and doctors are uncertain why he suffered the devastating strokes

No hope: After the strokes, Sam was in a coma in the ICU for 45 days.
Doctors told the family there was no hope of recovery and they should let him contract an infection, move 
him to a home and let him die, his finacee said

But Sally refused to give up on her boyfriend of four years, whom she had been planning to marry three months later.

On the day of her planned wedding, Sally said the struggle momentarily became too much.

‘I didn't cope very well at all and I actually completely lost it,’ she told ABC. ‘I'd say I probably had a nervous breakdown.

‘But I picked myself up pretty quickly after that, dusted myself off because what I was going through was nothing compared to what Sam was going through, nothing at all.’

After
 45 days in a coma in the Intensive Care Unit at Royal Brisbane Hospital
 – where he also contracted pneumonia – Sam woke up and began making 
slow progress.

With intense therapy, he began walking, but was still unable to speak or function alone. He could only moan and had the brain function of a young child.

Determined: But his fiancee Sally, pictured, refused to give up hope. 
She researched options on the internet and found that sleeping pill Ambien had
helped other stroke sufferers regain speech and movement in the past

Recovery: Sam can now speak after taking the pills. Sally has quit her job to look after him full time

Devoted: The drugs wear off after an hour, at which point Sam's speech becomes unintelligible again

Desperate to help her fiancé, Sally 
turned to the internet, where she found a video of another young stroke 
sufferer feeding himself and talking – thanks to doses of the sleeping 
aid Ambien.

Ambien, also called Stilnox, is a prescription medicine used to treat insomnia by initiating sleep.

It contains Zolpidem, which studies have
 found increases blood flow in the brain, particularly in areas involved in
 language comprehension - allowing improved function.

Studies into the connection between stroke rehabilitation and Ambien are ongoing.

John White at Moss Rehabilitation Center in Philadelphia is leading a study into the connection.

So far he has found that fewer than 10 per cent of stroke victims respond to the drug - and that Sam's case is extremely rare.

'We’re not able to yet advise families on how to use this drug clinically because the research is in the very early stages,' he told MSNBC.

‘It just blew my mind,’ said Sally, who then pleaded with doctors to give the drug to her fiancé. They refused, citing the lack of studies into the connection.

‘They almost laughed at us really. They didn’t think it was possible that a sleeping pill could awaken someone. But I felt compelled to.’

So Sally lied, saying Sam needed the pills to sleep and just days later, after a year of only being able to moan unintelligible sounds, he did the impossible – he began to talk.

He immediately phoned his parents and left them a message.

'There was Sam saying, "I’m talking, I’m talking". It was unbelievable', his father John Goddard told MSNBC.

While Sam's speech remains slurred and 
slow, it allowed doctors and family to realise his brain had been 
functioning the whole time – and he had just been unable to express himself.

On being able to speak again, he 'felt like shouting it from the rooftops', Sam told Rock Center.

'That’s the best part about the Ambien,' Sally said. 'It shows what I believed was true – he was really in there.'

Sam takes four doses of Ambien a day, but it only lasts an hour or less.

Future: They still hope to marry. Doctors continue to research the connection between strokes and Ambien

‘It is very difficult to comprehend the fact that I can talk now and in an hour or I won’t be able to talk at all,’ Sam told MSNBC. ‘It really sucks.’

Doctors at the Moss Rehabilitation Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania are now carrying out research into Ambien’s effectiveness in stroke patients' progress.

Sally now cares for her husband-to-be full time, and is still certain she will walk down the aisle one day.

‘A lot of people expected me to walk away,’ Sally said. ‘But they just didn’t realise our connection isn’t broken, it’s stronger than anything I’ve ever known before.

‘I wouldn’t be me without him. I’d be heartbroken.’
