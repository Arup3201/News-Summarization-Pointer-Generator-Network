A UKIP councillor has denied racism accusations over comments on immigration made on a video five years ago.

Footage emerged yesterday of Victoria Ayling – a former Conservative election candidate who defected this year – saying she wished to ‘send the lot back’.

The councillor denied being offensive or politically incorrect, and insisted she had been referring only to people in the country illegally.

Party leader Nigel Farage dismissed allegations that she held extreme views as a political smear and indicated his party would stand by her.

Mrs Ayling, a councillor in East Lindsey, Lincolnshire, made the video in 2008, to promote her bid to become a Tory MEP. The Mail on Sunday said it was provided to them by her then husband, who operated the camera. They have since divorced acrimoniously.

In a section published online, she is seen rehearsing her pitch on the issue – talking about the need to control the numbers arriving in the UK and to repatriate ‘the illegals and failed asylum seekers’.

‘That’s not quite policy yet. Maybe I should soften it a bit,’ she says at one point, adding: ‘OK. Send them back.’ In a later take, she says: ‘We must control immigration. We cannot sustain the numbers coming in; the strains on our infrastructure are enormous.

'Control should be done fairly and the points system like they have in Australia and all those coming here should be encouraged to speak English so they can integrate.’

Afterwards, she is heard to say ‘I just want to send the lot back but I can’t say that’ before joking that the remark might be used in future to ‘get back at me, bribery, blackmail’.

In March Mrs Ayling made headlines by telling David Cameron publicly at a conference that she was quitting his Tory party for UKIP.

At the 2010 general election she came within 714 votes of winning Great Grimsby from Labour for the Conservatives.

Defending her comments, she told the Mail on Sunday it was ‘nothing different from what the Home Secretary is advocating now anyway’.

‘I don’t think there is anything there that can be seen as offensive or politically incorrect,’ she said.

‘I stand by what I said: illegal immigrants should be sent back home and multiculturalism won’t work. It was a throwaway comment that has been taken out of context.’

Mr Farage went on Twitter to decry ‘an appalling attack on one of our councillors, falsely saying she is against all immigration’.

He said: ‘I have met her two or three times and I have discussed policy at length before accepting her into the party. I had no reason to believe she held views that were extreme or inconsistent with ours.

‘While this comment looks odd and unpleasant there may be a context here that is slightly different to the way it appears.’

Last night Mrs Ayling pointed out that the video had been made public by her ex-husband.

In a statement she said: ‘I have been overwhelmed with the messages of support I have been receiving, particularly via social media, and was very interested to read that many people – women in particular – read between the lines of this story and saw a man scorned and a woman trying to make her way in politics being used and caught in the crossfire of a party still trying to position itself after many years.’
