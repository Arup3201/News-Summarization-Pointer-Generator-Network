Boris Johnson today waded into the Westminster tax avoidance row – after insisting people had the 'right to minimise' how much they pay.

The London Mayor said everyone should pay their 'fair whack' but defended people's right to limit their 'obligations'.

His intervention came after Ed Miliband became embroiled in a furious row with the Tory Party after accusing David Cameron of not caring about tax avoidance because he was 'up to his neck' in it.

London Mayor Boris Johnson said everyone should pay their 'fair whack' but defended people's right to limit their 'obligations'

The Labour leader accused Mr Cameron of being a 'dodgy Prime Minister, surrounded by dodgy donors'.

Mr Miliband pointed the finger at Tory peer Lord Fink – accusing him of being involved in 'tax avoidance activities'.

In response, Lord Fink threatened to sue Mr Miliband for libel if he repeated the slur.

But less than 24 hours later, the former Tory treasurer admitted engaging in 'vanilla' tax avoidance. He added: 'Tax avoidance, everyone does it.'

Mr Miliband said Lord Fink's remarks were an 'extraordinary U-turn', adding: 'The thing he objected to was me saying he was engaging in tax-avoiding activities.'

He denied ever calling Lord Fink 'dodgy' – but said there were several other 'questionable donors to the Tory Party'.

The Labour Party has insisted that any suggestion Ed Miliband avoided tax was a 'straightforward lie'

When questioned about the row today, the London Mayor Boris Johnson told the Evening Standard: 'I think people have a legitimate right to minimise their tax obligations if they can but they should pay their fair whack. I do think it's important to be transparent.'

Nigel Farage added: 'What I would say is nobody willingly pays more tax than they have to and that is certainly true.'

Asked if he had ever taken measures 'to avoid paying tax', he said: 'I have never avoided any tax. I don't think I've ever avoided any tax myself through any complicated measures or in. No I haven't. I haven't. I haven't.'

Lord Stanley Fink has given £3million to the Tories and held a bank account in Switzerland

The row erupted when a list of political donors had bank accounts with HSBC's private Swiss banking arm was leaked.

Mr Miliband jumped on the revelation that many high profile Tories were named on the list and yesterday attacked the culture of tax avoidance.

His remarks sparked accusations of hypocrisy over his own family's tax arrangements.

Mr Miliband defended his tax affairs yesterday after being accused of benefiting from a controversial tax-avoidance scheme.

The Labour leader and his family used a 'deed of variation' to divide the ownership of the family home in North London after the Labour leader's father Ralph died in 1994.

These legal documents – which change the terms of someone's will after they have died – are used almost exclusively to reduce death duty bills in a legal form of tax avoidance.

Deeds of variation were described as 'tax abuse' by Gordon Brown when he was Chancellor.

At an event at his old school, Haverstock School in North London, Mr Miliband defended his own complex arrangements. Asked if he thought it was 'dodgy to use what's called in the trade a deed of variation, to leave your house to your children that avoids tax', the Labour leader said: 'The deed of variation issue is something directed at me personally, it's something that my mother did 20 years ago, that was a decision she made.

'Let me just say this: I paid tax as a result of that transaction, I've avoided no tax in that. No doubt the Conservative Party wants to smear mud today but frankly it's not going to work. The story has been written before and I have paid tax on that money.'

Labour today insisted any claim he avoided tax was a 'straightforward lie'. 

HSBC's private Swiss bank faces a Bank of England investigation

The Bank of England could investigate allegations of tax avoidance at UK-based bank giant HSBC, deputy governor Sir Jon Cunliffe indicated today.

Sir Jon said the Bank was 'not yet' at the stage of probing the bank's private Swiss arm, which is at the centre of claims that it helped customers dodge tax.

But he admitted the allegations, which have sparked a storm in Westminster, could be 'of relevance' to the Bank's prudential regulation authority which is responsible for enforcing stability in the British financial system.

Speaking to Radio 4's Today programme, Sir Jon said: 'I think the allegations around HSBC raise serious issues around HSBC's conduct.

'We'd expect the management, the leadership of a large group, to be able to ensure that there is a culture and the operations within that group to manage those sorts of risks.

'I wouldn't comment on the case because we are not at that stage yet, but this is certainly something that could be of relevance to us.'

It came as the former director of public prosecutions, SIr Keir Starmer criticised Government guidance that British citizens with Swiss bank accounts were unlikely to be prosecuted for tax evasion if they co-operated with the authorities.

Sir Keir, now a Labour Party parliamentary candidate, said the guidance issued in January 2013 following the signing of the UK-Swiss tax co-operation agreement, had come just as he was seeking to drive up prosecutions for tax evasion.

The guidance states that provided an account holder makes either a one-off payment or a voluntary disclosure in relation to their relevant assets and fully co-operates with HMRC, 'that person is highly unlikely to be subject to a criminal investigation by HMRC for a tax-related offence for past liabilities'.
