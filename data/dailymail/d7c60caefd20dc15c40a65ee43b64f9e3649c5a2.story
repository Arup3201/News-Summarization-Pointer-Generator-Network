Harry Kane kept his astonishing season rolling with two goals in two minutes for England’s Under 21s — only for France to hit back and inflict a first defeat in 12 games on Gareth Southgate’s men.

Tottenham striker Kane took his tally to 15 goals from 14 starts for club and country, but Arsenal’s French starlet Yaya Sanogo grabbed a brace of his own to wipe out the 2-0 lead.

Kingsley Coman rifled a shot into the top-left corner after 73 minutes to clinch the friendly win for France.

Kane struck first after 20 minutes of a rain-soaked contest in Brest, running on to an incisive pass from Tom Ince before dinking the ball over the goalkeeper with his left foot.

And the same combination struck again, with Ince — currently on loan at Forest from Hull — producing a brilliant turn before crossing for Kane to tap home from two yards.

An assistant failed to spot Sanogo was offside as he touched home Antoine Conte’s effort to reduce the arrears. Then on the stroke of half-time Sanogo levelled with another smart piece of poaching. 

It was the first defeat for Gareth Southgate's Young Lions and England Under-21s' first since the last European tournament in Israel in 2013 - a run of 15 games. 

The only blip in the meantime was a draw in Finland in September 2013.

England beat Portugal 3-1 in Burnley last Thursday for an 11th straight win and Southgate made five changes, with Kane among those coming in. 

There was torrential rain in western France and England had to withstand wave after wave of Les Bleus attacks as their impressive winning record faced a fierce test.

England showed their pedigree with with their first glimpse of goal.

Ince dropped deep and fed Kane in the left channel and the Tottenham striker showed composure to lift the ball over the on-rushing France goalkeeper Alphonse Areola.

A second followed swiftly when Ince turned brilliantly on receiving Nathaniel Chalobah's pass inside the edge of the area and then fired across goal with Kane applying the finishing touch on the line.

France halved their deficit with a deserved goal when Benjamin Mendy clipped the ball to the back post and Antoine Conte's cross was tucked in by Sanogo.

Chalobah departed injured soon afterwards with Jake Forster-Caskey of Brighton coming on in his place and another premature change was required when Ben Gibson went off, with Carl Jenkinson coming on.

France levelled after Jonathan Bond's save from Jordan Veretout found Paul-Georges Ntep de Madiba.

The winger turned the ball into the six-yard box where Sanogo pounced. It was no less than France deserved.

Sanogo fired into the side-netting as France pressure continued in the second half.

The English resistance was finally broken when Ntep de Madiba ran at the visiting defence and fed Coman, who side-footed into the corner for what proved to be the winner.
