Manuel Pellegrini is not worried about Manchester City's Premier League preparations despite a heavy 3-0 defeat to Arsenal in the Community Shield curtain raiser.

The Premier League champions looked second-best at Wembley with less than a week to go until they open the defence of their title against Newcastle.

But their Chilean coach is still confident he can get his side up to scratch by the time they visit St James’ Park - and he also believes he could have a deal for Eliaquim Mangala wrapped up by then to boost City's threadbare defence.

Difficulties: Pellegrini was troubled by his side's performance but is still confident of sorting things out in time

'It was not a good performance,' Pellegrini admitted. 'We played with a lack of pace that’s not usual in our team. I don’t know what happened.

'In the second half we improved - we had the chances but Arsenal scored with their only shot in the half. We have to talk about it and try to arrange it.'

But Pellegrini is not bothered by the pace problems of his side - or anything else, seemingly, as he looks to make City only the third club to successfully defend the Premier League title.

Get it sorted: The deal for Eliaquim Mangala is now just down to some missing papers, Pellegrini says

'I’m not so worried about the pace. We had important players missing today. I’m sure we’ll be ready to start the Premier League on Sunday.

'In the Premier League you have five or six teams who can win. In this moment we must demonstrate why we won the title this year. We have a lot of chances because we have a strong squad.' 

When asked about whether a deal for Mangala would get over the line the City boss said: 'I hope. 

'I think some papers are missing but we continue having an interest in the player and the player wants to come so we’ll see what will happen during the week.'

Painful sight: City's players, led by Yaya Toure, could only watch on as Arsenal lifted the Community Shield
