This black and white photograph, taken 75 years ago this week, captures the remarkable moment the first German plane was shot down over Britain during the Second World War.

As the broken swastika-adorned aircraft lies beaten on a hill, crowds of Scottish villagers from Humbie, in East Lothian, gather to inspect the wreckage. 

The Luftwaffe Heinkel He111 was forced to crash land in Scotland following a tense dog fight in the skies - and was later dubbed the 'Humbie Heinkel'.

Historic: The Luftwaffe Heinkel He111 pictured was the first plane to be shot down over British soil in the second World War - 75 years ago this week

The two surviving German crew surrendered to a local policeman, who was the first person to reach the scene, becoming prisoners of war.

Flight lieutenant Archie McKellar, 25, seriously damaged the Heinkel with machine gun fire, and it crash landed near the small village 75 years ago this week.

McKellar was killed a few hours after the official end of the Battle of Britain at the age of 28, and he became known as the 'Forgotten Ace'.

William Simpson, author of the book Greatest Squadron of Them All, has argued that reserve pilots such as McKellar deserve more recognition.

He says: 'So many people don't seem to realise this happened. This was significant. It was the first time that the Germans had attempted to attack anything within British airspace.

'They were trying to attack Royal Navy ships anchored in the east of the Forth Bridge and were intercepted by two squadrons flying Spitfires.

'These squadrons weren't regular air force flying the latest Spitfires, but auxiliaries or reservists.

'A lot of people think they don't get the credit they deserve. People have heard about the Battle of Britain, but these guys, who started the whole thing, are virtually unknown.'

The crashed Heinkel was part of a Luftwaffe squadron which had been ordered to attack Royal Navy Vessels in the Firth of Forth on October 28, 1939.

The RAF intercepted the Luftwaffe, sending Spitfires from 602 and 603 squadron, which resulted in a dog-fight over the fields of East Lothian in Scotland.

The Heinkel He111 was often described as a 'wolf in sheep's clothing' as it masqueraded as a transport aircraft - though its actual purpose was to provide the Luftwaffe with a fast medium bomber
