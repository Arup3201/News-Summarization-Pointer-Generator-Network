The fiancee of a man who claimed to be Henry Ford's illegitimate grandson has told a court she  only discovered his secret life of prostitutes and drugs when she found him murdered in their home.

The blood-soaked body of John Dahlinger was found by his long-term fiancee Melanie Yanchuk in their marital bed at their condominium in Grand Rapids, Michigan.

Pimp Danyell Thomas, 37, is accused of conspiring with a prostitute to drug and rob the 56-year-old before shooting him dead.

Dahlinger's late father has always claimed he was the illegitimate son of Henry Ford following an alleged affair the car manufacturer had with his young secretary.

In court Yanchuk wept as said she far as she knew her partner, a father-of-two, did not use drugs and did not use prostitutes.

'I would have no reason not to trust him. He was a good man,' Yanchuk said reported MLive.

'We were together 99 percent of the time.'

Yanchuk told of the moment in October 2013 when she found her partner of 24 years dead, saying: 'He must've tried to apply pressure to the wound (with a towel).

'It was just saturated in blood.'

She said she pulled the towel away from his face but 'it really wasn't a pretty sight, so I immediately put it back.'

'His face was all bashed in and it was covered in blood.'

During opening statements, Kent County Assistant Prosecutor Chris Becker told jurors that Dahlinger hired prostitute Dijana Kilic, to perform a lingerie show while he took drugs.

Kilic met the 26-year-old through a stripper friend in early October, reports WZZM.

She claimed Dahlinger said he owned a pornography website and a strip club in Detroit and he wanted her to work for him.

But his fiancee said he had lost his job in sales and he was working from home to start a new venture.

Thomas served as Kilic's pimp as well as the father of her child and her boyfriend.

Kilic, who pleaded guilty to armed robbery and was sentenced to one year in prison, agreed to testify against Thomas.

Charges: Thomas (pictured in court)  faces life in prison without the possibility of parole, if convicted of felony murder, conspiracy to commit armed robbery and felony use of a firearm

She told a court earlier that she did not have sex with Dahlinger, but he paid her $300 an hour to watch as he took cocaine.

Becker told jurors that on the death of his death Kilic was 'doing a lingerie show, changing clothes, putting different clothes on.'

'Part of the plan was to get him so high on drugs, to get him to pass out so they could steal his money at that point in time. But that didn't work,' he told the jurors. 

Kilic sent a text message to Thomas after Dahlinger was unable to produce another $300 when their time together entered a second hour, according to earlier testimony.

Thomas arrived and pointed a gun at Dahlinger and asked 'where's the money?' she previously testified.

Kilic said she left the bedroom and went into the kitchen, when she heard a single shot. 

Dahlinger died of a gunshot wound, blunt force trauma and a heart attack, a medical examiner determined.  

Two days after Dahlinger's murder, a friend of the family, who chose to remain anonymous, offered a 'substantial' reward for information leading to the capture of the person or persons responsible. 

The victim's mother, Barbara Dahlinger (who was married to John Sr.) has confirmed the claim that her son was the illegitimate grandson of Henry Ford.

'Yes, my husband was the illegitimate son of Henry Ford,' she told Detroit News. 

'So what if it's true? Everybody knew it back then. It's just old crap. I lived it. My son lived it. And there's nothing to be gained by rehashing all this again. The Ford Motor Co. owes us nothing.'

Ford Motor Co said in a statement after his death: 'We extend our deepest sympathies to the Dahlinger family for their loss, and we trust that those involved will be brought to justice.

'As this claim dates back many decades and has never been proven to be true, it would serve no purpose for us to speculate further.' 

Kent County Circuit Judge Paul Sullivan sentenced Kilic to five years' probation and ordered her to serve a year in the Kent County Jail for conspiracy to commit armed robbery. 

She has now been released. 

As part of the plea agreement, Kilic's testimony cannot be used against her.

According to the Kent County Prosecutor's Office, part of the plea also deal included allowing Kilic, a Bosnian immigrant, to stay in the country. 

She had been warned previously that her conviction could mean deportation.

Thomas faces life in prison without the possibility of parole, if convicted of felony murder, conspiracy to commit armed robbery and felony use of a firearm.
