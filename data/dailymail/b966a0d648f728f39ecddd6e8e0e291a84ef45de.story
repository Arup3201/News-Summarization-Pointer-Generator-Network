Nicolas Sarkozy has claimed that gay marriage ‘humiliates families’ in his first TV interview since announcing a return to politics.

The former French president, 59, said he detested the way equal marriage was forced through by Francois Hollande’s government last year.

Mr Sarkozy – who has begun his attempt to be re-elected as president in 2017 – said on French television: ‘The government is humiliating families and humiliating people who love the family.’

Asked if he would get rid of the law if he was to become president again, Mr Sarkozy said it would not be a priority when so many were jobless.

His wife Carla Bruni said in a separate interview with French Vogue that she disagreed with her husband over marriage equality.

The former model said: ‘I’m rather in favour because I have a lot of friends – men and women – who are in this situation and I see nothing unstable or perverse in families with gay parents.

‘My husband is opposed for reasons linked to his political vocation, because he sees people as groups of thousands rather than people we know personally.’

Mr Sarkozy launched his comeback to politics in a message on Facebook on Friday, declaring he is joining the race to lead the right-wing UMP party.

The former leader had told journalists they would ‘never hear from him again’ after he lost the election to socialist Francois Hollande in the 2012 election.

He said: ‘Looking at the disastrous state France risks finding itself in, I will have no choice.’ 

Friends say Mrs Bruni had begged him not to run again.

Sarkozy has faced several legal investigations since leaving office, including charges that he allegedly took campaign funds from former Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi. 

The leadership bid could also be hindered by a raft of corruption charges he faces over illegal campaign funding. 

He is accused of accepting illegal party funding payments from France's richest woman, the L'Oreal heiress Lilian Bettencourt, in return for tax breaks. 

He has accused the country’s socialist government of framing him with ‘grotesque’ accusations.

While Sarkozy's supporters are desperate for him to return to politics, the wider French population is less enthusiastic. A poll by OpinionWay found that 64 per cent of French people are not interested in his upcoming comeback announcement.
