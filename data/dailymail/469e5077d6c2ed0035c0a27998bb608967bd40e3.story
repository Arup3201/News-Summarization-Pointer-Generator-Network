It is the iconic festival made famous by American author Ernest Hemingway, but the running of the bulls has been rocked by negative publicity in recent years.

So these Spanish locals have come up with an unusual solution that will prevent any potential harm or stress to animals.

The town of Mataelpino, just north of Madrid, is staging an annual event in which locals can race through the streets chased by a giant white ball.

The running of the balls has been held for the past three years and it is known in the region as boloencierro.

During the video the residents run down the street excitedly as a group of men push the giant ball behind them.

It may lack the excitement of of an angry bull breathing down their necks, but these locals seem to enjoy the celebration just as much.

And there is less risk of injury. During the famous Pamplona San Fermin festival this year, a number of both holidaymakers and locals were gored during the running of the bulls.

Since records began in 1924, as many as 15 people have been killed while taking part in the dangerous activity.

While bullfighting is banned in Catalonia, it is still a common practice in other parts of Spain.

However, there are some other interesting alternatives. Instead off fighting the bulls, agile men known as 'recortadors' perform daring stunts with the bulls in some areas of the country.

As the animal charge, the men leap over their and dive out of their way, showing off their agility. 

The bull remains unharmed and is not killed at thee end of the fight.
