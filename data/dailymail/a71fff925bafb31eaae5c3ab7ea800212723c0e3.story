A finance director stole £78,000 to pay for his son and daughter’s boarding school fees after his salary was hit in the economic down turn. 

Kevin Ballinger, 43, turned to fraud after he lost his job during the financial crisis in 2008 and feeling  'under pressure to provide a particular lifestyle' for his family.

He found another position at Ambac Assurance UK in 2010, an American insurance firm, but the salary was not enough to cover the £30,000 a year fees to Brighton College - previously England's Independent School of the Year.

Ballinger instead siphoned the money from Ambac, making transfers for tens of thousands of pounds to Brighton College over two years to cover his children's fees. 

But in October last year bosses discovered  suspicious payments had been made and in November he was sacked.

Ballinger had tried to cover up the deception by making the transfers using a junior colleague’s computer and work profile.

He has now been forced to sell his family home to repay the money and his daughter has moved to a state school.

The Recorder of London, Judge Brian Barker QC, said: ‘You were under pressure to provide a particular lifestyle for yourself and your family.

‘You were living, prior to the banking crash, in pretty substantial circumstances and it may be you felt it necessary to provide that level of lifestyle for yourself and your family.

‘It is a tragedy to see you here. Like others you were caught in the banking downturn. Previous to that you had a substantial lifestyle but you were re-employed and you had a new job and a new start.' 

Ballinger, of Horsham, West Sussex, pleaded guilty to five counts of fraud by abuse of position involving a total of £78,767.

He was jailed for 15 months. 

Judge Barker QC added: 'The seriousness of this case is the breach of trust over a two year period. 

'You cast suspicion on your colleague who now feels betrayed by what happened.

‘It was a sophisticated operation and you went to considerable lengths to cover up what you have done.’

Lewis Power QC, representing Ballinger, told the court Ballinger had been trying to maintain a certain lifestyle for his family. He said : ‘Although dishonest he was doing his level best for his family.’

Since his dismissal Ballinger has been helping out at the job centre and making wooden planters.
