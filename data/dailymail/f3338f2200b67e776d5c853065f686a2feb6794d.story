With computer trickery, George Osborne morphs into Margaret Thatcher, and like her put home ownership at the heart of his Budget yesterday

George Osborne today revealed his surprise at being portrayed as the heir to Margaret Thatcher after his Budget marked a return to traditional Tory values of hard work and home ownership.

The Chancellor was celebrated by the Daily Mail for his measures aimed at restoring the ‘Aspiration Nation’ of the Tory 1980s with a dramatic photograph with him mocked up as the Iron Lady.

Asked about the bold image this morning, Mr Osborne told ITV1's Daybreak: 'Well it didn’t give me a nightmare because I didn’t see it before I went to bed. But I did choke on my toast and marmite this morning.'

Echoing Lady Thatcher throughout his Budget speech, the Chancellor 
repeatedly referred to Britain as an ‘aspiration nation’, insisting the 
Government was on the side of people who ‘work hard and want to get on’.
In another echo of the former Tory leader, whose mantra was ‘the lady’s
not for turning’, the Chancellor declared: ‘We must hold to the right 
track.’

Using the word ‘aspiration’ or ‘aspire’ 
16 times, the Chancellor vowed to ‘light the fires of ambition in our 
nation’ with a package of tax cuts and investment for businesses and 
housing.

The major measures included:

But his fourth Budget was delivered against a desperate economic backdrop, with growth forecasts halved this year from 1.2 per cent to just 0.6 per cent.

The independent Office of Budget Responsibility said efforts to reduce the deficit had stalled, and suggested the economy would not return to pre-crash health until early 2015.

The Tories will go into the next election on a platform of more austerity, with the vast national debt pile only forecast to start falling after 2017 – two years later than planned.

Business Secretary Vince Cable refused
to predict when the ‘age of austerity’ might end, saying only that it 
was ‘unlikely’ it would go on until 2020.

The Chancellor also unveiled 
the first overhaul of the Bank of England’s remit in almost a decade 
under plans for ‘monetary activism’ to counter flatlining economic 
growth.

The new governor, 
Canada’s Mark Carney, will still be charged with keeping inflation below
2 per cent – but will also be able to concentrate on jobs and growth, 
and given the freedom to use ‘unconventional’ measures.

The Bank will now be free to adopt the approach of the US Federal Reserve, which said last year it would keep interest rates near zero unless unemployment and inflation breached specific levels – giving families and businesses confidence.

Mr Osborne told MPs there were positive signs the economy was beginning to turn the corner, with the deficit down by a third since Labour was in power and 1.25million jobs created in the private sector.

The most eye-catching measure was the ‘help to buy’ scheme for those struggling to find mortgage deposits. It will mean £3.5billion becoming available for shared equity loans worth 20 per cent of the value of a new build house worth up to £600,000.

Other measures included childcare tax breaks worth up to £1,200 per child for working couples, but not until 2015, a new flat-rate state pension worth £144 a week and a £72,000 cap on elderly care bills.

Automatic pay rises for public sector workers paid simply for time served will be scrapped, with only the armed forces exempted. Public sector workers will also have to pay more in national insurance contributions.

Labour leader Ed Miliband sought to mock Mr Osborne, who joined Twitter yesterday, as the ‘hashtag downgraded Chancellor’. ‘The Chancellor has failed the test of the British people – growth, living standards, and hope – but he’s not just failed their tests, he has failed on his own as well,’ he told MPs. ‘All he has to offer is just more of the same.’

Unite union general secretary Len McCluskey said: ‘This is a Budget for the few by the few that attacks the many. Nurses, police and public servants take a pay hit, while corporations and millionaires are allowed to duck their tax duties to the nation.’

But John Cridland, director general of the CBI, said: ‘An extra one penny cut in corporation tax will also make the UK one of the most internationally competitive locations in which to do business.’
