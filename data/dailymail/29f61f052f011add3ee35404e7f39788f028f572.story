A British tycoon last night condemned his own firm for making an Argentine advertisement surreptitiously shot in the Falklands to claim ownership of the islands.

Sir Martin Sorrell’s surprise intervention came after Foreign Secretary William Hague attacked the film as a ‘stunt’.

Sir Martin said he was ‘appalled and embarrassed’ by the ‘totally unacceptable’ advert, and that apologies had been issued.

'An absolute insult': Argentine Olympic hopeful Fernando Zylberberg is seen running 'step-ups' over the steps of the British Great War Memorial in the Falkland Islands

The film, set to stirring martial music, shows Argentine Olympic hockey team player Fernando Zylberberg, 34, training in the British territory – including running on the spot on a war memorial – before ending with the slogan: ‘To compete on English soil, we are training on Argentine soil.’

Argentine president Cristina Kirchner, who reiterated claims to the ‘Malvinas’ on the recent 30th anniversary of her nation’s doomed invasion, put out the 90-second advertisement on television in her country under her own name.

Mr Zylberberg ratcheted the row up even further yesterday by revealing how filming took place under false pretences – and saying that as he performed he felt like he was ‘running towards a battlefield’.

The advertisement was produced by the Buenos Aires wing of the advertising giant Young and Rubicam, a subsidiary of Sir Martin’s firm WPP.

Last night he said: ‘The ad is totally unacceptable. The agency has formally apologised for any offence or pain caused. We are appalled and embarrassed by it.’

Mr Hague said yesterday: ‘Argentina has had some diplomatic setbacks in the last few weeks.

‘They failed at a summit of the Americas to get other countries – South and North America – to issue a declaration on the Falkland Islands. I think what is happening is they are looking for one or two stunts to try to make up for that or save a bit of pride somehow.

‘But I don’t think trying to misuse the Olympics in some way for political purposes will go down very well with other countries.’

Opening scene: After a caption reading 'Islas Malvinas', the Argentinian name for the Falkand Islands, hockey player Zylberberg is seen stepping out early in the morning for a run

Obvious landmarks: As the advert progresses, Zylberberg can be seen limbering up outside the Globe Tavern, a popular pub in Port Stanley

Passing ALL the sights: As rousing music reaches its eventual peak, Zylberberg jogs past the office of the Penguin News, which today ran quotes from Falkland Islander Ian Hansen criticising the advert

The Foreign Office also criticised the advert as an attempt to exploit the Games, while ignoring the Falklanders’ wish to remain British.

Mr Zylberberg proudly told yesterday how he and three fellow athletes entered the Falkland marathon in March as a ruse to get on to the island.

‘The filming took place in secret,’ he added. ‘I ran thinking of my own personal training for the Olympics but also with the idea in my head that I was running towards a battlefield.’

Evocative and provocative: A close-up shot shows a hand, supposedly Zylberberg's, meaningfully rolling sand through its fingers

Pointed message: With the rugged Falkland Islands countryside in the background, the caption reads: 'To compete on English soil'

Dramatic pause: After the first caption fades out, the most incendiary comment follows: 'We are training on Argentine soil'

Final say: In an emotion-charged final shot, the screen fades to white with the message: 'Tribute to the fallen and ex-combatants'

Young and Rubicam sent American cameramen to arouse less suspicion before reportedly giving Mrs Kirchner a copy of the film, then selling her government the right to use it.

Last night a spokesman for the firm in New York said: ‘We strongly condemn this work and have asked the Argentine government to pull the spot.’

The Daily Mail has also learnt that Young and Rubicam’s British wing, Rainey Kelly Campbell Roalfe, is currently reaping a fat payment from Britain after producing the BBC’s current advertisement for its Olympics coverage.
