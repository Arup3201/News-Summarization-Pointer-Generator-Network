A California surgeon has been disciplined for removing the wrong kidney of a federal inmate and leaving him with the diseased one.

The Orange County Register reported Tuesday  that the state medical board placed Dr. Charles Coonan Streit on probation for three years.

The board said Streit, a urologist who has had his license for 41 years, relied on memory to decide which kidney to remove because he didn't have access to the patient's complete medical records.

The 2012 operation at Fullerton's St. Jude Medical Center involved a 59-year-old federal inmate. The hospital was fined $100,000 because CT scans were left in an office on the day of the surgery.

The inmate, who was serving time at Terminal Island, a low-security federal prison in San Pedro, underwent a second procedure to have the cancerous kidney removed.

An attorney representing Streit didn't reply to a message seeking comment. 

The Register reports that Streit  has been barred from supervising physician assistants and is required to enroll in a wrong-site surgery course offered by the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine.

The board described Streit's conduct as 'an extreme departure from the standard of care,' and listed the many aspects of standard operating protocol that would have prevented the error.

Streit and his assistants could have postponed the surgery until the proper records were available and could have done a renal ultrasound to determine which kidney was tumorous. 

Nurses and an anesthesiologist who assisted Streit in the surgery told inspectors that the patient told them the wrong side when they asked him which kidney was diseased. 

CBS news reports that though wrong-site surgeries are rare, -- occurring once every five to 10 years -- they are not unprecedented.

 The Register reports that the Department of Public Health have fined two other Orange County hospitals for wrong-site surgeries in the past seven years.
