Gerard Pique could miss Spain's last World Cup match in Brazil after leaving practice Saturday with a leg injury.

Team officials did not specify which leg Pique hurt, and say the Barcelona defender will be evaluated on a day-to-day basis ahead of Monday's Group B game against Australia.

Both teams are already out of contention, with 2010 champion Spain losing 5-1 to Netherlands and 2-0 to Chile in its opening two matches.

Pique was dropped from the lineup before the loss to Chile.

Spain will be playing for pride at Curitiba's Arena da Baixada after becoming the first defending World Cup champion to be knocked out after just two group games.

Goalkeeper David de Gea also remains in doubt for Monday's match.
