American officials blamed the Iranian government for a series of coordinated hacking attacks that targeted U.S. banks.

The hackers purposefully targeted bank databases and flooded their systems causing major disruptions and even complete shutdowns of company networks.

No money was stolen and no individual accounts were breached as the hacks were merely meant to disrupt business for the banks, which officials say is a trademark of a government-lead attack.

Targeted: A series of cyber attacks have disrupted service to the data centers for a long list of U.S.-based banks like Citibank, but because they only effected the websites and did not steal money, officials believe they were government-backed

'There is no doubt within the U.S. government that Iran is behind these attacks,' former state department official James Lewis told The New York Times.

Distrust: American officials believe that the hacks were approved by Iranian government forces, headed by Mahmoud Ahmadinejad

Mr Lewis, who now works as a computer security expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, says that the unparalleled to any prior government-backed attacks.

Though the attacks have been kept relatively quiet- largely because the lack of stolen funds caused little concern to individual bank users- a shocking amount of financial institutions have been targeted.

So far, Bank of America, HSBC, Capital One, PNC, Wells Fargo, U.S. Bancorp and Fifth Third Bank have all been disrupted.

A hacking group named Izz ad-Din al Qassam Cyber Fighters claimed responsibility for the attacks in an online message board, but the U.S. government says that group is simply a puppet organization run by the Iranian government.

Government-on-government virtual attacks are not unheard of, and the U.S. has actually perpetrated their own against Iran in the past.

According to a different New York Times story, the U.S. teamed up with Israel in 2010 to target the computer facilities at a Iranian nuclear facility.

Iranian
government officials deny having any connection to the latest string of
attacks, saying that they would not stoop to the American's level.

Excuse? The hacking group that claimed responsibility for the attacks said that they were done because the U.S. government refuses to completely remove the offensive anti-Islam film made by Nakoula Basseley Nakoula (center)

'Unlike
the United States, which has per reports in the media given itself the 
license to engage in illegal cyber-warfare against Iran, Iran respects 
the international law and refrains from targeting other nationsâ€™ 
economic or financial institutions,' Alireza Miryousefi, an 
Iranian-United Nations envoy, told The New York Times.

In the online post which boasts of plotting the attacks, Izz ad-Din al Qassam Cyber Fighters say that the attacks are due to the American government's refusal to remove an anti-Muslim film from the internet.

'But the american profiteer rulers' insistence and persistence in disregarding this reasonable demand of all Muslims of the world and not taking an action to remove this offensive film shows these tyrants insist that continue to insult Muslim saints,' the group wrote in a document on hacker-friendly site Pastebin.

U.S. officials differ, however, saying that it simply a ruse and the true reason is the continued implementation of economic and political sanctions against Iran.
