One of Denver’s most publicized celebrations of the legalization of the sale of recreational marijuana has been cancelled, just hours before the New Year brings an end to the state of Colorado's prohibition of the drug.

The City of Denver took the extraordinary step of hand-delivering a letter threatening to rescind the liquor license of the downtown venue at which the party, dubbed Cannabition, was due to be staged.

The letter also threatened legal action against all sponsors and participants in the all-day party, planned by cannabis tourism company 420tours.

Cancelled: Party organizer Matt Brown had planned to hold a celebration of the new rules on marijuana

The move serves as a warning shot for any who view the New Year and the new law as heralding a free-for-all for public cannabis consumption. 

In a statement to MailOnline, 420tours founder and party organizer Matt Brown said: ‘It is unfortunate that the City of Denver has chosen to take such a hardline stance against the idea of adults assembling to legally celebrate the unprecedented milestone represented by Amendment 64.’

Cannabition had been intended as the major organized celebration of the historic legal change.

Organizers had hoped to stage the party at the city’s NORAD Dance Club but at 4pm on Friday afternoon Denver Department of Excise and Licenses delivered a letter to club owners.

The letter stated: ‘We … dissuade you from hosting the event; however, if you go forward, we will exercise any and all options available to the City of Denver to halt the event and hold the business owners responsible for violations of law.

‘We are also ready to hold individual attendees responsible for violations of City ordinances prohibiting public consumption of marijuana.’

On Monday afternoon, after much argument and negotiation, Mr Brown and the club owners admitted defeat.

Barred: An all-day party, due to be held at Norad dance bar, has been shut down

New era: Colorado marijuana growing facilities and dispensaries have been preparing for the new rules, with the introduction of marijuana-infused drinks

Munchies: Edible marijuana products are also being introduced in the state

It is the clearest sign yet that the 
City of Denver, under statewide and even worldwide scrutiny, is 
determined that the licensed sale of marijuana on January 1 should not 
be confused with a free-for-all in public consumption of the drug.

But it is a bitter blow for Mr Brown, who said it is too late to find another venue for the highly publicized event.

He said: 'It is disingenuous for the city to tell the world that Colorado is open for business when such major questions remain regarding what happens after "seed to sale" when the whole point of amendment 64 is to responsibly consume cannabis without fear or retaliation.'

In reality, though the sale of cannabis in licensed premises is legal, public consumption is not and Mr Brown is one of many pushing for the nascent legislation to go further and permit public consumption, as well as sale, albeit under controlled circumstances.

But, with Colorado under intense public scrutiny, it is perhaps unsurprising that those tasked with enforcing the new law on January 1 should be concerned with just that and remain intolerant of any attempts to stretch it beyond the liberties so newly granted.

Know the law: Michael Elliott, Executive Director of the Medical Marijuana Industry Group, points at some of the laws that will accompany the legalization of recreational marijuana on January 1

Amendment 64 is the first legislation to set up a framework to regulate and tax sales of recreational marijuana.

It not only decriminalizes it but establishes a legal market for the drug, licensing cultivation, processing and retail.

It is illegal to give or sell marijuana to a minor.

You must be over 21 to purchase the drug. Those from instate can buy up to 1 oz in any form.

Anyone form out of state can buy half that quantity and must consume it before crossing state lines.

Retailers
 must be licensed and currently all such licenses have been issued to 
growers and retailers already providing medical marijuana which has been
 legally available in Colorado for a decade.

Recreational
 marijuana will be taxed at 15 per cent excise and 10 per cent sales tax –
 higher than that sold to holders of a medical certificate, or ‘red 
card.’

It is illegal to
 drive high. An initial legal limit of five nanograms of THC per ml of 
blood was set but it has been suggested that this could be waived for 
drivers testing above this cutoff who show competence to drive.

It is illegal to consume marijuana in public.
