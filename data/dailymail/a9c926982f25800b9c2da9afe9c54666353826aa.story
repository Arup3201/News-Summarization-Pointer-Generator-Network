It's a craze that's been blamed squarely on the internet - but as these 100-year-old photos reveal, cat owners have been dressing up their pets since long before the age of the blog.

The surreal catalogue shows kittens in dungarees, silly paper hats, bonnets, bow ties and dresses, and has been revealed as part of a landmark archive of 12 million out-of-copyright images which are being placed online by a single academic.

Kalev Leetaru, a Fellow at Georgetown University in Washington D.C., hopes his vast collection on the photo-sharing site Flickr will become a landmark new resource for history-lovers around the world.

Get your paws on some history: As these images from 1911 show, dressing up cats in silly costumes is a craze which long predates the age of the blog. The photos from Kittens and Cats: A Book of Tales by Eulalie Osgood Grover are part of a vast collection of out-of-copyright images which have been uploaded to Flickr by an academic

Tea time: The text before this image reads: 'I wish someone would hurry and bring me some milk. Mine is all gone and so is my mouse. I wonder if this is all we are going to have to eat. I am so hungry I shall have to go home and catch a rat. The Queen is asking some one to tell a story. I believe she means me. Yes, dear Queen, I will'

Mew wardrobe: The surreal photos feature cats dressed up in dungarees, overalls and dotty bow ties. The book is just one of thousands uploaded to Flickr

The cat images were drawn from a 1911 collection called Kittens and Cats: A Book of Tales by Eulalie Osgood Grover, a U.S. children's author who sold millions of books in the first half of the 20th Century.

The book is just one among 600 million library book pages which have been scanned for uploading to the archive by Mr Leetaru - and the range is astounding.

The images stretch from 1500 to 1922, when copyright laws kicked in, and range from colourful depictions of Queen Victoria's spectacular coronation parade to intricate pen-and-ink drawings of human anatomy and mosquitoes.

There is a disastrously inaccurate drawing of a dodo made by a Dutch researcher long after the animal became extinct, along with a rather chilling map of how the then-fading British Empire would be turned into Greater Britain including Australia and Canada.

Other images show the beginnings of Britain's railway history from the London Underground to Manchester, the Blackpool seafront and an early layout for the New York subway.

Going for a ride: The cats are in surreal situations - though the collection also includes intricate drawings of human anatomy and a hair-raising sketch of a mosquito

Picture purrfect: As with humans, much of the expression comes from the eyes, but having a bizarre array of hats and bonnets probably doesn't do any harm

Strike a pose: Despite his archive containing three million images so far, Mr Leetaru couldn't help admitting the cat images were among his favourites in the collection

Long before the digging of the Channel Tunnel there were books discussing how it would be possible, and charts showed off the dramatic spread of Alexander Graham Bell's telephone throughout the United States.

Mr Leetaru carried out the incredible trawl in his spare time without a penny of funding.

It was made possible by writing software which took out-of-copyright books which had already been uploaded to the internet, stripping out their images and adding keywords and context to make the archive searchable.

Almost three million images have been uploaded so far, and by the time the project is finished there are expected to be 12 million. 

Despite the huge wealth of historical images, he couldn't help admitting that the cat pictures were among his favourites. 

He told MailOnline: 'I came up with the project last fall, and ran a pilot of the project across all 600 million pages earlier this year, but with small-resolution images, just to see what it would produce.

Husband and wife? Many of the cats are dressed up in intricate costumes, their size suggesting they may have been painstakingly custom-designed

Shut-eye: In one case, a cat is pictured in a tiny bed. The researcher said: 'The project was entirely unfunded and there was no huge team, just me, and I did it entirely in what little spare time I had. So, its a perfect example of what's possible today from purely volunteer and personal projects in the era of "big data"!'

The researcher added: ''I wanted to be able to search for images matching a certain keyword, to be able to trace imagery through time. For example, to see the imagery of the "telephone" change over the decades as it changed from being the realm of male businessmen at work to the whole family at home'

Mystery: What makes the online Flickr archive so curious is that many of the photos come with only cryptic descriptions, leaving the viewer guessing as to their origins

Modern day: Cat memes were thought to have started online like these two felines who have made waves on social media posing for dinner (left) and wearing a fez (right)

'The results were so stunning that I then went back and created the final full-resolution version you see today.

'The project was entirely unfunded and there was no huge team, just me, and I did it entirely in what little spare time I had. So, its a perfect example of what's possible today from purely volunteer and personal projects in the era of "big data"!'

He added: 'I wanted to be able to search for images matching a certain keyword, to be able to trace imagery through time. For example, to see the imagery of the "telephone" change over the decades as it changed from being the realm of male businessmen at work to the whole family at home.

'I realised there were so many books that had been digitised about the telephone, but there was simply no way to just see a collage of all of their images. So, this project was born. 

'For the vast majority of the images you see in books, there isn't some original copy hanging in a museum somewhere - the printed copy of that image you see in that book is likely the only copy surviving of that image. So, in a way this is also sort of an art project, creating the world's ultimate online art museum!'

Fascinating: The archive on Flickr will eventually number 12 million images and contains several gems. This chart was printed in the Bell telephone magazine in 1922

Intricate: In the days before photography there are well-studied drawings of everything from the growth of the telephone in 1922 (left) to a human head in 1905 (right)

Needs work: The description of this drawing of a dodo from an 1848 book remarked on how inaccurate it was, resembling the animal as much as it did a fighting cock

Hair-raising: This mosquito comes from the 1867 book Hardwicke's science-gossip: an illustrated medium of interchange and gossip for students and lovers of nature

Explaining his software, he added: 'It actually is quite simple, which is what makes the project so amazing. 

'It relies on the fact that when a book undergoes Optical Character Recognition to make it searchable, that software automatically identifies all of the images in the book so that it won't look there for text.

'Historically that information is just discarded, but in this case my tool goes back and uses that information to extract all of those images.

'It amazes me that people have been digitising books and OCR'ing them for decades and no-one had ever thought to use that discarded information to extract and catalogue the images.

'I'm going to be releasing the software and other technical instructions for other libraries to use in the next few weeks.'

You can browse the archive yourself by using the search tool on Flickr.

Grand plans: Just as the Empire was in its dying days in 1895, this map was printed under the title 'The electoral government of Greater Britain: a suggestion'

History: This 1902 image showed London more than 100 years ago, with the River Thames, Charing Cross station and Trafalgar Square visible in the foreground

Grand: The collection also includes incredible images of the coronation procession for Queen Victoria which rumbled through London in 1838

Impressive: The images were taken from a publication called The Tableau of the procession at the coronation of Queen Victoria, June 28, 1838
