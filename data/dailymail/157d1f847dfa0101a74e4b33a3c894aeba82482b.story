Julie Bishop has revealed the heartbreaking moment Myuran Sukumaran's mother hugged her tightly and begged her to save her  son from the firing squad.

Lawyers for Bali Nine duo Myuran Sumkumaran and Andrew Chan lost an appeal on Tuesday to challenge Indonesia's presidential decree to spare the men from execution.

The Foreign Minister said while the pair's lawyers were lodging an appeal, she hoped Indonesia would see the 'value in these men's lives' as the federal government seeks a stay of execution. 

'My last meeting with Mrs Sukumaran she hugged me so tightly I could hardly breathe,' Ms Bishop told Nine's Today show.

Julie Bishop has revealed the heartbreaking moment Myuran Sukumaran's mother, Raji, hugged her tightly and begged her to save her drug smuggler son's life

'She begged me to do all I could to save the life of her son whose own life had been rehabilitated in such an extraordinary way. 

'No person could fail to be touched by the anguish of the families.' 

It comes as a Jakarta court determined on Tuesday it couldn't examine Indonesian president Joko Widodo's decision to refuse clemency for Chan and Sukumaran as they await execution in Bali.

Lawyers for the two Australians will appeal the court's decision not to hear their last-ditch challenge, arguing it would be unthinkable if they were executed in the meantime.

Authorities say preparations are being made to move the convicted drug smugglers to the prison island where they are set to face the firing squad, with the move "very likely" this week.

'We are very disappointed that the appeal was lost at this point,' Ms Bishop said.

The Foreign Minister said while the pair's lawyers were lodging an appeal, she hoped Indonesia would see the 'value in these men's lives' as the federal government seeks a stay of execution.

'We continue to appeal to President Joko Widodo's sense of generosity and his sense of forgiveness and hope that he will consider these clemency pleas and that there will be a stay of execution.'

Ms Bishop said she wasn't understating the gravity of their drug crimes, but noted it was 10 years ago and they had made efforts to rehabilitate with Chan now a priest and Sukumaran being an accomplished artist.

'Both men have been rehabilitated in the most remarkable way. They are adding value to prison life in that they are working with other prisoners.

'They are rehabilitating other prisoners and helping Indonesia with this whole process of rehabilitating people, such as drug offenders.'

Todong Mulya Lubis, the pair's lawyer, said that their legal team would appeal the judge's decision after court ruled it couldn't examine Indonesian president Joko Widodo's decision to refuse clemency

Lawyers for the Bali Nine duo now have 14 days to lodge an appeal, according to one of their lawyers Peter Morrissey.

'(Indonesia) have a court system, they have a rule of law and when you have the rule of law it stands to reason that you just don't execute the people who are litigating,' Mr Morrissey said.

'So what we think will happen is that the Indonesian executive will likely cooperate with the rule of law and act in accordance with it and not do anything drastic unless all legal impediments really are removed. And right now there is a live appeal on foot.

'We are very hopeful about it, you know. We are not going to give up. Even if we had no hope we wouldn't give up. But we do have hope because the argument is a sensible good argument.'

It's a rare challenge, and the only one like it was brought by an anti-drugs group against the decision to grant clemency to another Australian drug smuggler, Schapelle Corby

Lawyers for the pair argued in court that the Indonesian president  did not follow due process when he denied the Bali Nine pair clemency.

They claimed that President Joko did not consider their circumstances  because the pair were death row drug offenders.

The only other case ever deemed to be outside the realm of the court was brought against fellow Australian Schapelle Corby. 

When the same challenge was brought by an anti-drugs group against the decision to grant clemency to the convicted drug smuggler in 2012, the court ruled that it had no power to overturn presidential decrees. 

The 37-year-old is now free on parole. 

Authorities say it's 'very likely' the Bali Nine duo will this week be relocated to the island where Indonesia plans to execute them.

Reports from the Indonesian government indicate that the duo will be transported via military planes to Nusakambangan penal island.

It has not been confirmed whether the government will use a Hercules plane which will mean a journey by both air and land for the pair, or the smaller airforce fighter jets which can land directly on the island. 

Four jets from Denpasar airport have the capacity to land in the regency of Cilacap, where Nusakambangan is located, and would take an estimated three hours to fly the 900 kilometres from Bali to the island where the Australians are scheduled to be executed. 

If the Indonesian government made the decision to deploy a Hercules from Densapar, where the pair are being held, to Yokyakarta, the former capital in East Java, Chan and Sukumaran would then have a four-hour road journey to reach the Cilacap port to be ferried to Nusakambangan Island. 

Chan and Sukumaran were to be transferred from their Bali jail cells to the island last week, but it was found to have inadequate isolation cells.

Indonesian Attorney General HM Prasetyo on Monday said preparations were now 'about 80 per cent' complete.

Construction materials have been arriving on the island and a jail official has said there are orders to accelerate the works for completion within days.
