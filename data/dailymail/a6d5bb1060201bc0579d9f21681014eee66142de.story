Everyone has experienced those pangs of sadness when your precious furry friend passes away.

But now, a memorial diamond company has curated a way to keep your late pet close to you at all times: by turning its ashes into a precious diamond ring.

According to the Wall Street Journal, LifeGem creates rings from people's ashes and has made more than 1,000 diamonds from animal remains in the past decade 'mostly from dogs and cats but also a few birds, rabbits, horses and one armadillo.'

The ultimate tribute: This ring is made out of cremated pet cat (not the cat pictured here on the left)

The site's website explains that the LifeGem diamond provides a way to embrace your loved one’s memory day by day, describing it as 'the most unique and timeless tribute available for creating a testimony to their unique life'.

On the 'precious pets' page, CEO Greg Herro writes: 'If you are reading this, you are going through one of life's toughest times right now. I know because I've been there.

'I've even questioned whether the love was worth this pain… but it was. She added more to my life than words could ever say.

'Sometimes I miss my girl so much it hurts to breathe, but our memories will never fade.

'Even through the tears, she finds a way to bring a smile to my face every day.

'Nothing will ever replace our special bond, but my LifeGem does provide comfort through an everlasting connection to the one I have lost.

'I hope it will do the same for you and your wonderful pet.'

But keeping your furry friend forever doesn't come cheap, with prices for pet diamonds starting at $1,400 (£870).

One self proclaimed 'cat lover' spoke to the Wall Street Journal about her own cremated cat ring.

In a video interview she said: 'For me this was a way of turning my little diva into something that would bring me joy' as she reminisces with teary eyes over her former furry friend 'Meowy'.

Pet lovers: The ring would be a perfect memory for animal lovers Paris Hilton and Sharon Osbourne when their beloved pets pass away

Natalie Pillen added: 'She was a huge part of my life growing up, she was there for many milestones for me, so it was really hard.'

'I think the process took two or three months, the diamonds were really pretty perfect.

'It felt like I had taken something that had meant so much to me for so long and turned it into something beautiful that will still continue to bring me joy and happiness in spite of the sad circumstances that produced it.

'She would be happy that it came out so beautiful.'
