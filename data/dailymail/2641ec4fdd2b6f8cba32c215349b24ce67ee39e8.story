Which game will you watch on Saturday night?

English football's showcase finale is under threat from Spain.

Barcelona and Atletico Madrid's title decider on Saturday will clash with the FA Cup final between Arsenal and Hull.

ITV and BT Sport have the broadcast rights to the Wembley match but Sky Sports will be hoping to snatch away viewers as La Liga goes down to a winner-takes-all meeting at the Nou Camp.

Atletico have a three-point lead over second-placed Barca but Lionel Messi and Co will become champions with a victory because of their superior head-to-head record.

A draw and Atletico would win their first title in 18 years and break the Barcelona-Real Madrid stranglehold for the first time since 2005.

The FA Cup final is beamed round the world and usually pulls in millions of viewers. Traditionalists who have campaigned for the return of the 3pm Saturday afternoon kick-off have been told that early evening is a ratings winner.

Unfortunately the same thinking applies in Catalonia this weekend, which means neutrals must decide between the magic of the Cup or the glamour of the La Liga.

While Hull's progress to the final is a fairytale for the city, the club do not have a world-wide fan base which makes it less appealing on a global basis.Arsenal's pulling power is greater as Arsene Wenger bids to end his nine-year trophy drought.

There is another issue at stake. The FA's sponsorship deal with Budweiser ends after Saturday's final, which means that Arsenal vs Hull is also a major marketing opportunity.

One that the likes of Messi, Xavi, etc can mess up as they bid to snatch the title after a season which has been dogged by off-field issues, not least the tragic death of former coach Tito Vilanova. Â
