Diplomatic row: Colombian ambassador Gabriel Silva has said Obama should apologise after the secret service sex scandal damaged the reputation of Cartagena

Colombia’s diplomat in the U.S. has demanded that President Obama say sorry for the secret service sex scandal  - which he claimed has damaged the reputation of his country.

Gabriel Silva gave an impassioned interview to Colombian newspaper El Tiempo where he criticised the American government's handling of the scandal which saw federal agents buying hookers.

The incident became public on April 12 when one of the prostitutes argued with a Secret Service agent over her payment in a hallway of the Caribe Hotel.

Mr Silva was furious that the media storm over the incident has focused on the city's sex industry - where prostitution is legal.

Mr Silva told the paper: 'It is necessary, and I want to hear 
it from the White House.

'A more clear expression of remorse is required 
to protect the reputation of Cartagena.'

Last
week, President Barack Obama described the
prostitution scandal as 'a little distracting' and branded the 12 agents 
involved 'knuckleheads'.

Since then, a dozen Secret Service employees, including two supervisors, and 12 military personnel have been implicated.

Eight of the Secret Service officers have been forced out, the agency is trying to permanently revoke the security clearance of one, and three others have been cleared of serious wrongdoing but will face administrative discipline.

The Secret Service was also now investigating a news report that employees allegedly engaged the services of prostitutes in El Salvador on another trip abroad for the president.

Seattle television station KIRO-TV 
reported last week that there are allegations that during a trip last
year to El Salvador, agents engaged in activities similar to those in Colombia.

The Secret Service official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss ongoing investigations, said the agency is trying to determine whether the reports are accurate.

The report came after Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano told lawmakers that what happened in Colombia was an isolated incident and that it would surprise her if there were a broader problem.
