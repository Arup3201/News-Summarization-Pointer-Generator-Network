Cleared: PC David Hair was found not guilty of using racist language after he admitted asking a black female colleague if she was 'going home to cook bananas'. He claimed it was an honest reference to cooking

Two police officers were cleared of racial harassment today after one admitted saying a black man looked like a monkey while another allegedly told a black colleague that she was 'going home to cook bananas'.

Metropolitan Police constables Kevin Hughes, 36, and Pc David Hair, 42, were both found not guilty on two separate charges each at London's Westminster Magistrates' Court.

PC Kevin Hughes, 42, was patrolling the East End of London in a squad 
car when he made the remark about a black man looking like a monkey to colleague PC Costas Dakoutros.

When challenged by PC Dakoutros, Hughes said ‘It’s true’ and added: 
‘They’re closely related to chimpanzees and more closely related to 
Neanderthals.’

During the same patrol another workmate, PC Kirk Baker, heard Hughes 
say: ‘Black people haven’t evolved, they live in mud huts in Africa.’

He went on to say that black people’s ‘sticking out ears and thick lips’ made them resemble primates.

Prosecutors claimed the case revealed a culture of racism in the Victim 
Offenders Location Time (VOLT) team which was based in Newham, one of 
the most ethnically diverse areas of the country.

But Hughes, along with PC David Hair, 36, a fellow member of the VOLT 
team, was cleared of a public order offence and racially aggravated 
harassment.

Hughes wept as District Judge Howard Riddle announced the verdicts at 
Westminster Magistrates’ Court, while Hair signed with relief.

But today a police watchdog urged the Met to still consider taking legal action against the officers.

The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) said Scotland Yard should 'seriously consider' its findings in relation to the case.

IPCC commissioner Mike Franklin said: 'The IPCC’s investigation into alleged racist comments made by Pcs Hughes and Hair concluded in June when we passed our findings of potential gross misconduct to the Metropolitan Police Service for their consideration.

'I urge the Metropolitan Police Service to give serious consideration to the issues raised in our report.

'Any misconduct hearing will need to determine whether the comments are a breach of the professional standards expected of police officers.'

Hair was alleged to have racially abused PC Julia Dacres while travelling in a police minibus last March 13.

He asked her if she was going to do some overtime and then said: ‘I 
didn’t know if you were going to go into a little rant and say how you 
had to go home and cook bananas’.

Hughes would also talk in a mock-Asian accent call other officers ‘auntie’ and ‘uncle’.

He thought it was hilarious because he had dealt with Asian man who said
he was ‘visiting his aunty for a party’ in a very thick accent.

He admitted he had referred to the men’s similarities to monkeys but 
said it was during an innocent conversation about evolution and had 
nothing to do with his race.

‘I just said it has nothing to do with him being black, I noticed him 
because he had elongated limbs, his gait,’ Hughes told the court.

Relief: PC Kevin Hughes arriving at Westminster Magistrates Court yesterday where he was cleared of threatening, abusive words or behaviour

‘I said that was why I picked him out, because of the way he was walking - it was a fleeting glance.

‘I was just trying to reinforce my point that I believe that some human beings had characteristics that resemble monkeys.’

Hair admitted making the bananas comment, but denied that it was racially motivated.

He told the court: 'I could've used any food but I'm aware that bananas are something that are cooked, sometimes as fritters.

'Unfortunately for me, I'm now aware that they are called plantain.

'As far as I'm aware a banana is a banana.'

Senior District Judge Howard Riddle said: 'Whatever precisely Pc Hughes said, it was unacceptable and offensive.'

He said that 'in these circumstances it did not amount to a criminal offence'.

Noting that 'context is central', Mr Riddle pointed out there had been no aggression or threat.

He said: 'Freedom of speech is a cherished principle. Freedom of speech includes the freedom to be offensive.

'It
is, of course, restrained in a number of ways - employers can require 
employees to avoid offensive language or lose their jobs. The civil 
courts can provide redress for harm caused.

'But when the state tells people 
what they can or cannot say, on pain of criminal sanction, the position 
is different.

'Citizens expect strong justification for curtailing 
freedom of expression. Offensiveness is not enough. Context is central.'

Hughes, of Ingrave, Essex, and Hair of Epping, Essex, were both found 
not guilty of one count of using threatening, abusive, or insulting 
words or behaviour to cause another person harassment, alarm, or 
distress and alternative charge of racially aggravated harassment.

The judge praised the MPS and CPS for bringing the case.
