A blonde mother-of-two nicknamed 'Mental Maxine' stabbed her own father with a kitchen knife after starting a huge family row with him over her missing pet Staffordshire bull terrier.

Tattooed Maxine Tattersall, 27, from Accrington in Lancashire, turned up at the home of Paul Higgins to pick up her belongings in October last year shouting 'where's my f**king dog' and told him 'if you stop me I will chop you up' before lunging at him with an eight-inch blade.

As family friends looked on in horror, Mr Higgins managed to throw his arms up in self-defence in order to protect himself and luckily managed to escape with just cuts to his hands.

A court heard shortly before the attack in October last year Tattersall had been staying intermittently with her father, but had decided to go the house with her boyfriend to collect her belongings - including her pet dog

Tattersall,  who has previous convictions for violence and a problem with binge drinking, goes by the name of 'Mental Maxine' on Facebook and has posted a variety of pictures showing off her star facial tattoos.

Preston Crown Court heard in the lead up to the attack in October last year Tattersall had been staying intermittently with her father, but had decided to go the house with her boyfriend to collect her things and move out.

Michael Goldwater QC, prosecuting, said: 'The defendant is the owner of a Staffordshire Bull Terrier, which the father had last seen five days earlier.

Mother-of-two Tattersall, who has facial tattoos, pleaded guilty to assault occasioning actual body harm but managed to escape a prison sentence

'On October 19 at 5.45pm she said she was coming to the property to collect her belongings. She arrived at 6pm. 

'Virtually the first thing she said was "where's my dog?" Paul Higgins said he didn't have it. 

'She was accompanied by her boyfriend, Mark Gallagher, who Mr Higgins did not get on with so he ordered him out of the house.'

The court heard Tattersall began picking up her belongings, instructing Mr Gallagher to put them into a waiting taxi.

Mr Goldwater said: 'Paul Higgins' account is she had a kitchen knife, which was eight inches long. 

'She asked him "where's my f**king dog" and said she would take another dog from the house if she did not get hers.

'She also said "if you stop me I will chop you up" and held the knife 18 inches from his face.

'Another occupant said the defendant then attempted to move an injured American Bulldog from the household. 

'Mr Higgins tried to get hold [of the dog] and he then saw a raised knife.' 

'She turned around and lunged out at Mr Higgins' chest and he put up his hands to protect himself.'

The court heard Mr Higgins suffered two cuts to his hands..

Mr Goldwater said: 'The injury was administered by the defendant wielding the knife. There were two cuts, one between the thumb and forefinger and one at the base of the palm near the wrist. He didn't attend hospital and didn't need medical treatment.'

Tattersall has four previous convictions - assault occasioning actual body harm, criminal damage and possession of a weapon.  

She had previously been given a suspended jail term. 

In mitigation defence barrister Paul McDonald said his client was changing her ways for the sake of her children, who live with relatives. 

The court heard Tattersall  is 'curbing her drinking' and is anxious to put the attack behind her

The row began when Tattersall demanded to see her Staffordshire Bull Terrier, similar to this one (pictured)

Tattersall was given 30 weeks in prison suspended for two years and was placed under a supervision order

He said: 'It's clear that she had possession of the knife, clear that her father was injured. There is clearly animosity.'

He said Tattersall was 'curbing her drinking' and was seeking counselling and was anxious to put the attack behind her.

Recorder Peter Atherton, said: 'It seems that you have had an addiction or addictions to drugs and or alcohol which have undoubtedly influenced your behaviour. 

'It's not clear whether you were under the influence of drugs or alcohol at this time. 

'But in terms of your behaviour, drugs and alcohol had clearly been a factor to cause you to behave the way you have.' 

Despite admitting assault occasioning actual body harm, Tattersall has avoided a prison sentence. 

She was given 30 weeks in prison suspended for two years and was placed under a supervision order for 24 months.

She must also pay a £100 victim surcharge.
