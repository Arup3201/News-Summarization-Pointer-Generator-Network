Alive: After a four-hour search, 6-year-old Nathan Woessner was found alive by excavators at Indiana Dunes National Park

What started off as a fun summer afternoon at the beach turned into a nightmare when 6-year-old Nathan Woessner was swallowed into a sinkhole and disappeared beneath the sand.

After a four-hour search that many rescuers believed had turned into a recovery mission, they found the Sterling, Illinois boy alive but unconscious.

As of Sunday he was in critical condition at Comer Children's Hospital in Chicago, but he is expected to make a full recovery.

Woessner was visiting Mt Baldy at the Indiana Dunes National Park with his family Friday when he fell into the sinkhole.

Apparently the boy had been playing in an area that had been roped off, authorities said.

His family didn't see him swallowed into the hole, but heard his screams and ran over to the scene.

Woessner's father and a family friend attempted to dig the boy out but the boy just kept sinking deeper.

They called 911, and a rescue crew of 50 firefighters and private contractors were sent to the dunes with excavation equipment. 

It was a race against time, according to firefighter Brad Kreighbaum, the team was losing hope fast.

'We tried to just stay focused,' Kreighbaum told WSBT. 'The first two hours was complete misery.'

Rescue effort: It look an army of 50 firefighters and private contractors to find the boy buried under 14 feet of sand

Finally after four hours they located the boy.

At around 8 p.m. they found Woessner completely immersed in sand and unconscious when they pulled him out, so they feared for the worst.

It was only when the boy was on the way to the hospital, that rescuers got word back at the site that the boy was conscious - breathing, bleeding and crying.

Found him! Finally the rescuers found Woessner and quickly transported him to a Chicago hospital for treatment

Dig faster: Rescuers were scared that the boy wouldn't be alive by the time they got to him

'It went from a very grave situation to...it couldn't have worked any better,' Kreighbaum said.

Rescuers hope to meet the boy when he is better again.

'I really hope we get to meet this young man because he's extraordinary. He went through a lot'  Ryan Miller of D&M Excavating said.

Responding: When rescuers first pulled the boy out, he was unconscious. But they later learned that he was breathing and crying while on the way to the hospital

Recovering: Woessner is in critical condition still, but hasn't sustained any life-threatening injuries or brain injuries despite the lack of oxygen

Woessner was transported to Comer Children's Hospital and his parents are 'upbeat and hopeful' he will pull though, Michigan City Police Chief Mark Swistek told The News-Dispatch.

Miraculously the boy hasn't sustained any life-threatening injury or brain injury from the lack of oxygen, according to Michigan City Fire Department spokesman Mark Baker. 

The park will remain closed until officials and determine what caused the sinkhole and if it's safe, opening it at earliest on Monday.

'We've never heard of anything like this, or any of the dunes around here,' said Supervisory Park Ranger Bruce Rowe.
