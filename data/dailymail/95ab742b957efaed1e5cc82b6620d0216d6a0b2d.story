The mother of murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler today told the Leveson Inquiry of the moment she was given false hope her daughter was alive after a News of the World phone hacker deleted some of her voicemails.

Sally Dowler described her euphoria after calling the schoolgirl's number and being patched through to her answer phone. The mail box had previously been so full that she would only get an automated message.

'I rang her phone,' she said. 'It clicked through onto her voicemail, so I heard her voice.'

Mrs Dowler described shrieking at her husband: ''She's picked up her voicemails Bob! She's alive!'

Target: Mrs Dowler sat alongside her husband as she described the way in which she found out her missing daughter's phone had been hacked by a News of the World investigator

But she was only able to access her 
daughter's voicemail because News of the World investigator Glenn 
Mulcaire had hacked into the phone and deleted some messages to make 
room for more recordings.

Mrs Dowler was not to discover the 
truth until July this year after police reopened the investigation into 
the News of the World hacking scandal.

They confirmed that Milly's phone had been targeted. Mrs Dowler told Lord
Leveson that she did not sleep for three nights after being told what 
had happened. She said the revelation was 'terribly difficult to 
process.'

'YouÂ  replay everything in your mind 
and just think, "oh, that makes sense now, that makes sense,"' she said.

High Court hearing: The hacking of Milly Dowler's phone was one of the most high profile incidents in the scandal

Murdered: Milly Dowler was 13 when she was abducted on her way home from school in Walton-on-Thames, Surrey

Milly went missing in 
Walton-on-Thames, Surrey, in March 2002 as she walked home from school. 
She was abducted and murdered by car clamper Levi Bellfield, her body 
only found six months later on Yateley Heath, in Hampshire.

In the aftermath of her 
disappearance, her parents underwent intense press scrutiny. The 
discovery that her phone had been hacked by Mulcaire was the catalyst 
for the Leveson inquiry into press standards.

The Dowlers were the first witnesses 
to take the stand where they were asked to outline their experiences 
during the hunt for their daughter.

Giving an example of press 
intrusion, Mrs Dowler described how she and her husband were 
photographed on a private walk to retrace their daughter's steps seven 
weeks after Milly disappeared.

Three days later a picture of Mrs Dowler touching a 'Missing' poster appeared in the News of the World.

'We quietly retraced her steps and no-one was around,' she said.

'We had put out 'Missing' leaflets and I was checking to see if the right poster was up.

A writer whose phone was hacked after she had a relationship with an MP said press regulation was not 'adequate' and recommended a more 'complex' approach.

Joan Smith, a journalist and novelist who described herself as a 'very minor public figure', told the inquiry that tabloid newspapers seemed to live in a '1950s world'.

Ms Smith, former partner of MP Denis MacShane, said Britain's tabloid culture was 'remorseless' and 'almost infantile'.

She said the system of regulation needed to change. She said she did not think the Press Complaints Commission - and its predecessor the Press Council - were 'adequate'.

'I don't think they're adequate bodies to deal with this kind of problem,' she told the inquiry.

'I think it needs to be much more complex.'

Ms Smith (pictured) said tabloid journalists had forgotten that they dealt with people.

'The people involved have lost all sense that they are dealing with human beings.'

'I think we have a tabloid press which is almost infantile in its attitude towards sex and private life.'

She added: 'My impression is that tabloid hacks go around like children who have just discovered that their parents have sex and they cannot resist taking a peek around the door.'

Ms Smith said she was Mr MacShane's partner between 2003 and 2010.Police told her that her voicemail had been accessed by Glenn Mulcaire in April.

She said hacking had started six weeks after Mr MacShane's 24-year-old daughter, Clare, died - in a skydiving accident in Australia - in 2004.

Ms Smith said she thought she had been hacked because of her relationship with Mr MacShane - a former Labour Foreign Office minister and MP for Rotheram - and was 'collateral damage'.

She told the judge: 'I was amazed by how shocked I was.'

'That was on the Thursday, and the following Sunday that photo appeared 
in the News of the World. We did not see anyone - they must have taken 
the photo using a telephoto lens.

'How on earth did they know we were doing that walk on that day? It felt
like such an intrusion into a really private grief moment.'

Counsel
to the inquiry Robert Jay QC suggested that the press was a 
'double-edged sword' for the Dowlers because they needed publicity to 
help the search for their daughter.

Mrs Dowler agreed, telling the hearing at the Royal Courts of Justice in
London: 'You have to remember we were really, really desperate for some
information about Milly.

'So the press were in a position to be able to help us, and they did get
the message out that she was missing, and lots of information came into
the police headquarters.

'But on the other hand, (there is) the persistent being asked questions 
and being doorstepped and everything else that's associated with it - 
all the letters that you get requesting books, films, interviews.'

Mr Dowler said the couple became nervous about leaving their house because of the constant attention from journalists.

'You really are afraid to open your front door because you are faced with a question,' he said.

News Corporation chairman and chief executive Rupert Murdoch apologised 
in person to the Dowlers for the 'totally unacceptable' hacking of 
Milly's phone, the inquiry heard.

'It was a very tense meeting... He was very sincere,' Mrs Dowler said.

The couple were asked what they hoped would be the outcome of the inquiry into the hacking scandal.

Mr Dowler said: 'We would sincerely hope that News International 
and other media organisations would look very carefully how they 
procure, how they obtain information about stories. Obviously, the 
ramifications are far greater than what appears in the press.'

Inquiry chairman Lord Justice Leveson thanked the couple for agreeing to give evidence.
He told them: 'I am very conscious that it is a strain. I can only 
sympathise with both of you for the appalling losses that you have 
suffered and for the traumas that you have undergone over many years.'

Mulcaire was jailed along with the News of the World's former royal 
editor, Clive Goodman, in January 2007 after they admitted intercepting 
voicemail messages left on phones belonging to royal aides.
