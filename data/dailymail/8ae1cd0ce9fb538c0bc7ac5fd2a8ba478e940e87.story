Sir Alex Ferguson has given his first verdict on Louis van Gaal’s reign at Manchester United, suggesting the new Old Trafford manager has been ‘brilliant’.

Ferguson has been an interested onlooker as Van Gaal has gone about the task of rebuilding the squad he inherited from David Moyes in the summer.

The Dutch veteran has spent big as he looks to undo the damage of the 2013-14 season and the United first team now looks vastly different to the one Ferguson led to the Barclays Premier League title just 16 months ago.

Just two players who were involved in Sir Alex Ferguson's final match as Manchester United boss were picked by Louis van Gaal for the 2-1 victory over Everton. 

Fergie's final match - West Brom 5-5 Man Utd (May 19, 2013)

Lindegaard, Valencia, Evans (Ferdinand 83), Jones, Buttner, Carrick, Anderson, Cleverley (Giggs 60), Kagawa (Scholes 69), Hernandez, Van Persie

Van Gaal's last match - Man Utd 2-1 Everton (October 5, 2014)

De Gea, Rafael, McNair, Rojo, Shaw (Blackett 71), Valencia (Fellaini 79), Blind, Mata, Di Maria, Van Persie, Falcao (Wilson  73)

But Ferguson has endorsed Van Gaal’s approach and said: ‘Louis van Gaal has made a lot of changes and, thinking about that, actually, maybe he’s doing the right thing — to clear the decks and build his own team. 

'Because he’s got the experience and coaching ability to do that. The way he’s approached it, I think he has been brilliant.’

Van Gaal is still integrating players like Angel di Maria, Radamel Falcao, Daley Blind, Ander Herrera, Marcos Rojo and Luke Shaw into this team as United slowly creep back up the Premier League table after an uncertain start to the season.

It is understood, though, that United still plan to recruit four more new players in the next two transfer windows. Van Gaal, for example, still wants a top-class central defender, a holding midfield player and a right back.

Ferguson has attended a good number of United matches but has deliberately kept his distance from Van Gaal as the former Barcelona and Bayern Munich manager has settled in.

The former United boss has never once regretted his decision to retire in May 2013. But speaking in an MUTV interview — called ‘Sir Alex: Life After Management’, which will be aired on the club's station on Monday — Ferguson light-heartedly recalled his first few months as a former manager.

He said: ‘It was the first time I’ve ever had a holiday in my life in December and I’m sitting there at poolside in Abu Dhabi and I said to Cathy, “I should be at Carrington”.’

Ferguson refused to comment on extracts from former Manchester United captain Roy Keane's book

Meanwhile, Ferguson will resist the temptation to hit back at Roy Keane in print over the infamous bust-up that led to the Irishman leaving United under a cloud in November 2005.

Keane has re-opened their war of words in his explosive new autobiography The Second Half in which he refers to Ferguson as a ‘f****** p****’ over the incident. Coincidentally, the second instalment of Ferguson’s autobiography, is being updated and released in paperback on October 23.

However, sources at publishers Hodder & Stoughton say that Ferguson will not be adding to his existing account of the rift with Keane. Instead, he will focus on the year that followed his retirement and Moyes’ ill-fated spell.
