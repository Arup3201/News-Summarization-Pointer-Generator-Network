A
student suing police officers after she fell out of a moving patrol 
car while handcuffed - shattering her jaw - said she tumbled out of the vehicle to avoid being sexually assaulted.

Kim
 Nguyen, 28, filed a lawsuit against the Los Angeles Police Department last September 
after she fell from the car following a public intoxication arrest on on March 17, 2013.

In a new filmed deposition, seen by KCal9, she said that she was handcuffed in the back of a squad car when one of the officers sat beside her and began sexually assaulting her.

Lawsuit: Kim Nguyen, 28, claims she fell from a police car - smashing her jaw - after an officer started sexually assaulting her. She had been arrested for public intoxication before the March 2013 incident

'He was grabbing my left inner thigh 
and trying, I'm assuming, to open my legs,' she said with her face down.
 'Touching my chest and pulling my ear to me to face towards him.'

She added that when she was arrested 
outside a Koreatown restaurant as she waited for a taxi, she was the 
only one taken away in the patrol car and her male friends were left 
behind.

Nguyen, a 
business student at Loyola Marymount University, said the officerâ€™s 
negligence caused her to tumble out of the vehicle, her attorney Arnoldo
 Cassillas told KCal9.

A 
video of the incident does not show the moment she fell from the car, 
but does reveal her lying in the road apparently wearing no dress from 
the waist down.

Injured: Surveillance footage caught Nguyen on the road after she fell from the moving patrol car

Hurt: Her bloody face can be seen in the footage. She required three jaw surgeries after the incident

Speaking out: She has claimed that she fell to escape a sexual assault by one of the officers

The surveillance footage also shows her face bruised and bloodied.

In an incident report, paramedics reported that police said Nguyen fell as they accelerated after an intersection stop.

According to a paramedic report, the 
police officers said they were traveling at 10mph when she fell
 on to the road. However, the surveillance appears to capture the car 
traveling at a faster speed.

Nguyen said that she shattered her jaw and had brain bleeding. She had three surgeries on her jaw and lost several teeth.

Injuries: Nguyen stayed in hospital for 2 weeks as she underwent multiple surgeries for her broken jaw

Lawsuit: The student is now suing two of the officers who picked her up for being publicly intoxicated

The lawsuit sues the two officers involved in her arrest and the city of Los Angeles for unspecified damages over negligence. 

The LA Times named the officers involved as David Shin, a three-year veteran of the force, and Jin Oh, who has been a cop
 since 2008.

Police patrol cars are fitted with special locks that prevent prisoners from falling or jumping out during transit.

The LAPD said they would not comment on pending litigation.
