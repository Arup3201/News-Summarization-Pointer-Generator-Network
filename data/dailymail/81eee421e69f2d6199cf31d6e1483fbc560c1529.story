Prefers the warmth: Robert Vick walked away from a 6-year prison sentence on Sunday and only spent one night on the outside before turning himself in Monday after temperatures in Lexington, Kentucky plummeted

An inmate who escaped from a Kentucky prison on Sunday spent just one night on the outside before turning himself in because he was so cold.

Wind chills plunged the temperature in Lexington to 20 below zero after Robert Vick, 42, walked away from a six-year sentence at the minimum security Blackburn Correctional Complex on Sunday.

When he came running back on Monday it was with frostbite and a burning desire to get out of the arctic cold.

Before he turned himself in, Vick first tried to seek help at a motel not far from the prison.

He happened to knock on Victoria Fugate's door at the Sunset Motel.

'He was hungry. The dude knocked on our door, we gave him a ham and cheese sandwich, we gave him some hot chocolate,' Fugate told Lex18.com.

Vick apparently spent the night in a nearby abandoned farmhouse, where life on the outside proved to be too much.

'The next thing you know,' Fugate said, 'they are arresting him, he's frostbit.'

Chill reception: Vicks escaped from the minimum security Blackburn Correctional Facility, where he was serving 6 years for burglary, but got a chill reception on the outside

'He was pitiful': Vick wandered to this motel, where guest Victoria Fugate took pity on him and offered him a ham sandwich

'I thought he was crazy': Vick spent just one night as a free man and after holing up in an abandoned farmhouse overnight he returned to the motel, where he asked manager Maurice King to 'call the law' on him

He has a point: Along with much of the US, Kentucky was pummeled by some of the coldest temperatures in decades starting Monday

On Monday, after just one night of freedom, Fugate strode into the office of Sunset Motel manager Maurice King begging for a favor.

'He said "Can you call the law on me?" And I looked at him, I thought he was crazy or something,' King said.

'He was ready to go back,' Maurice laughed.

Authorities arrived with an ambulance and took the frostbitten convict to the University of Kentucky for treatment.

Department of Corrections spokeswoman Lisa Lamb says Vick would have been dressed in prison-issued khaki pants, a shirt and a jacket when he escaped.

He was returned to the Blackburn Correctional Facility by Monday night.
