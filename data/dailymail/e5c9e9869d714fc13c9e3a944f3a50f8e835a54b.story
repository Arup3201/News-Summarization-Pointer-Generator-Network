Religious groups representing Muslims, Hindus and Sikhs last night banded together to demand an end to sex-selective abortions – saying current legislation is not sufficient to prevent it.

The 25 groups, including the Muslim Women’s Network, the Hindu Council and the Sikh Women’s Alliance, have written to every MP to demand the change.

Around 100 MPs have said they will support an amendment making it clear that it is illegal under the 1967 Abortion Act to terminate a pregnancy on the grounds of the unborn child’s sex.

Campaigners say the practice is more common among many of Britain’s ethnic communities, where girls are less prized than boys.

The letter expresses regret at the unwillingness of parties on both sides to see beyond the rhetoric around whether they are ‘pro-choice’ or ‘pro-life’.

It states that the wording of the present law, which does not specifically rule out sex-selective abortions, provides ‘mixed messages’ which is ‘causing confusion’.

The British Pregnancy Advisory Service, for example, argues that sex-selective abortion is not illegal because ‘the law is silent on the matter’.

The signatories warn: ‘We are confident that this contributes to complacency in the minds of those who, for whatever reason, do not want a girl.’

The letter is also signed by the Sikh Council and other religious organisations including Imam Ajmal Masroor, Sharan Project, Jeena International and Karma Nirvana.

Led by Tory MP Fiona Bruce, around 100 MPs are believed to be in favour of an amendment to the Serious Crime Bill, which is likely to be debated on 23 February.

The amendment reads: ‘Nothing in section 1 of the Abortion Act 1967 can be interpreted as allowing a pregnancy to be terminated on the grounds of the sex of the unborn child.’

The letter says: ‘Since news broke of the sex-selective abortion amendment to the Serious Crime Bill, we have been concerned by how much airtime has been given to radical voices opposing the initiative.

‘Sex-selective abortion must end. We were campaigning for this long before Fiona Bruce or anyone else became interested. We are delighted that so many MPs have responded positively to our efforts.’

The letter adds: ‘If the current framing of the law allows the British Pregnancy Advisory Service to argue that sex-selective abortion is not illegal because “the law is silent on the matter”, or the British Medical Association to say that aborting for foetal sex is permissible in some circumstances, then the law requires clarification.

‘To be clear: the amendment does not change the grounds of the Abortion Act. It merely makes explicit something which is already unlawful.

‘It does not preclude abortion where there is a sex-linked disability in the foetus.’
