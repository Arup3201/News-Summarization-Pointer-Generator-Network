A 40-year-old British woman was being quizzed last night by detectives as part of an investigation into an alleged plot to blow up an Italian synagogue.

Counter-terrorism officers swooped on an address in south London just before dawn yesterday after intelligence from Italian police suggested she had been discussing weapons and explosives on Facebook with a suspected Islamic extremist accused of planning an atrocity in Milan.

Last night Scotland Yard was liaising with Italian police to establish whether the woman was linked to Mohamed Jarmoune, 20, who was arrested yesterday in Brescia, northern Italy.

'Target': Italian detectives believe the woman may have been in contact with a man involved in an alleged terror plot to attack Via Della Guastalla synagogue in Milan

Questioning: Police revealed that the Moroccan suspect had images of the synagogue stored on the hard drive of his computer

He is suspected of plotting an attack on a Jewish synagogue in Milan. 
  Police said they had found images of the target on his computer and a document, 'noting every detail' about the building.

Italian police believe he created seven 'super secret' Facebook profiles to discuss terror tactics.

Officers in Brescia said they had 
intercepted messages on extremist websites and discussion boards in 
which Jarmoune allegedly spoke of carrying out a 'jihad mission'.

Italian police claimed the woman in 
London had been in regular 'electronic contact' through  Facebook with 
Mr Jarmoune, but they had not physically met.

A Scotland Yard spokesman said: 'Her arrest is in connection with an alleged posting of extremist material on the Internet.'

Officers took away several items including his computer as well as several Nazi flags that were found in the apartment, which was in the centre of city and which has been the scene of several anti terror investigations in the past.

Suspect: Mohamed Jarmoune is suspected of setting up hidden Facebook groups that could be accessed only through a complicated system of controls

Police said Jarmoune had lived in Italy since he was six years old but he had 'come across their radar' as part of another investigation and when they began investigating his background discovered he had been looking at several Islamic extremist websites.

He was being held on suspicion of plotting an attack on the Jewish synagogue in Milan with the use of information that he had downloaded from the internet and police revealed he had images of the building stored on the hard drive of his computer.

He had detailed security measures for the synagogue and a pencil diagram appeared to show a series of four gas canisters connected to a battery, which was also linked to a mobile telephone, while other images showed the preparation of explosives.

An Italian police source said that the Scotland Yard investigation was 'parallel' to the one in Britain and that she had been 'discovered' by detectives in London. 

Anti terrorist officers in Brescia also said that they had intercepted messages on various Islamic extremist websites and discussion boards, from Jarmoune in which he spoke of carrying out a 'jihad mission'.

Probe: Brescia's police chief Lucio Carluccio, centre, spoke about the arrest during a news conference

Brescia police chief Lucio Carluccio said: 'We are not talking about a traditional criminal terror organisation, those groups are now fewer and fewer but what we are talking about is isolated groups springing up of young men who contact each other via the internet.

'They use these message boards and discussion groups to discuss terrorism with the message being to strike whenever and wherever you can. The information obtained from his computer was very detailed and very specifically about the synagogue in Milan.

'The investigation also discovered that he was in contact with the woman in London via one of the Facebook accounts and she has been held by colleagues in Britain who are carrying out their own investigation. What we do know is that they were in contact on Facebook discussing arms and explosives.'
