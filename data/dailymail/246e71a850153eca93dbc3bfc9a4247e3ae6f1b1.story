Jose must not be the silent one 

Jose Mourinho and I had our share of disagreements last season, and this is not me simply having another go at him, but it’s so frustrating when he doesn’t come out and talk after games.

People say he is being clever and trying to turn the screw on referees. No he’s not. He’s in a panic because he had a bit of a rough spell and saw an eight-point lead over Manchester City disappear.

There is certainly no campaign against Chelsea from the referees or the media. He wants to create an ‘us against the world’ mentality because he loves his teams to be the underdog. Unfortunately, he has a team that is ready to win the league.

The only people who suffer when Jose stays silent are the fans. They are the ones who adore him and want to know what he thinks of the game. If I was a player, I would be saying: ‘Come on gaffer, the fans want to hear from you.’

Sir Alex Ferguson did it when things were going badly but there are no excuses. I can’t imagine Roman Abramovich will be too happy either, with Jose painting the club in a negative light.

The current managers, players, ex-players and members of the media - and I include myself in that - are lucky enough to work in an era when TV coverage has brought huge money into the game.

The Premier League has been good to everybody, so he should have a bit more respect for that. The least he can do is oblige the fans who want to hear from him.

Berahino bonus

Saido Berahino is in demand but Tony Pulis won’t want to let go of his only real match-winner.

Berahino has started the past two campaigns on fire, but slowed in the second half of last season, as our table shows. This time he has six goals in three games in 2015. No wonder he was back celebrating again on Saturday.

Burnley face a Danny dilemma 

Burnley have a real predicament on their hands.

Danny Ings is out of contract in six months and is a wanted man. Do the club sell him now and earn a quick buck or hang on and risk losing him for nothing in the summer?

He is a fantastic young player and could be the difference between Burnley staying up or going down.

He is a quality striker and, Chelsea or Manchester City apart, he could improve any side in this League.

He has the work-rate, technique and the temperament to became a top player, and he took his goal against QPR so well.

With all respect to Burnley, he is destined for bigger things. The big question is when?

Sean Dyche has a duty to get top money for him but if he helps keep Burnley in the top flight, that could be worth so much more.

If they hang on to him now and he keeps them up, then he could happily move on in the summer knowing he leaves with the club’s blessing.

Markovic is starting to make his mark

It’s been a stop-start season for Lazar Markovic, but he did well at Sunderland.

It’s easy to forget he’s just 20 years old — the red card in the Champions League showed his immaturity — but now we are seeing the potential he has to become a top quality player.

I love seeing players run with the ball with their head up and he does that brilliantly — like a young Steve McManaman. He cost £20million but he could prove to be a cheap signing in the long term.

Koeman's coup

Louis van Gaal talks about three-year plans and needing time to build his squad, but he was taught a lesson on Sunday.

Only five players on each side survived from the same fixture last year, so Ronald Koeman has had to rebuild his team just as much as Van Gaal.

The only difference is he has done so with greater success and at a fraction of the cost.

Alan's right at home

Anyone wondering why Alan Pardew changed clubs only had to look at Selhurst Park on Saturday. At Newcastle, the ‘Sack Pardew’ banners were on ice. At Palace, they would have carried him out of the ground if they could.

Jamie's Premier League number crunching

1,945 - Leicester's winner against Villa was a long time coming for Paul Konchesky. The left back had not scored a Premier League goal for 1,945 days. On September 13, 2009, he scored the first for Fulham in a 2-1 win over Everton at Craven Cottage.

13 - Maybe it was no surprise to see Alan Pardew’s Crystal Palace come from behind to beat Spurs. Pardew has won 13 points from losing positions this season, more than any other manager.

1964  - QPR are the first side to lose their opening 10 away games in the top flight since 1964. Sunderland were the last team to claim that dubious honour, though they recovered to finish 15th.

13 - Given their reputation as a team of tough defenders, it’s surprising to see Stoke have conceded 13 goals from set- pieces, the most in the league.

45 - Leighton Baines's assist for Steven Naismith’s goal set a Premier League record for the most by a defender. Baines beat Graeme Le Saux’s record of 44. 

0 - Manchester United failed to have a shot on target on Sunday. The last time that happened in the league at Old Trafford was against Arsenal in May 2009. That 0-0 draw won them the title.

8 - Liam Bridcutt’s red card for Sunderland means they have had eight players sent off since the start of last season. Only Newcastle with nine have received more reds in the same period. Maybe it’s a North-East thing!
