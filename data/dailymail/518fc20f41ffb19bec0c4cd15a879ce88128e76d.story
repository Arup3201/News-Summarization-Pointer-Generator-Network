Lesley Nicol's role in Downton Abbey has made her extremely popular in the states

Downton Abbey has brought many things for actress Lesley Nicol: worldwide admiration after a long but unsung career in the business, the chance to spend half the year in a £2 million home in Los Angeles, and a string of rock stars and Hollywood  A-listers queuing up to talk to her.

Perhaps the most incongruous is former Guns N' Roses drummer Matt Sorum, whom she met through their work with the charity Animals Asia.

'He came for lunch at my house in Los Angeles and I really didn't think we'd have two words to say to each other because we're from different ends of the planet,' says Lesley.

'He's a rocker and he's got more tattoos than David Beckham but he's gorgeous – and he's a Downton fan. So now I've been to see him play and we've become friendly. How bizarre is that?' she laughs.

It's thanks to Downton's popularity in the US that Lesley now spends half her life in LA, where she rents a home in Beverly Hills. It's part work and part play.

When she's not out hiking with her husband Da'aboth or having lunch with new friends like Bette Midler, she's auditioning for roles – she's recently had parts in hit shows Once Upon A Time and Raising Hope.

Downton attracts its fair share of snipers over here, but in America it's a different story. 'They all love the show,' she says.

'Chelsea Clinton sent me a tweet saying the whole family love it, which was rather sweet. And someone told me Mike Tyson wants to be in it. Bette Midler first got in touch with me by Twitter and we've become friends, and even Harrison Ford said he'd like to be in it.

'But one of my favourite moments came when I met Richard Chamberlain. I was introduced and I told him I'd met him when I was 16 at the stage door when he was playing Hamlet in England. He told me he loved Downton. He was adorable.'

In the flesh Lesley, 61, looks a decade younger and a hundred times more polished than Mrs Patmore. When she's filming Downton, which is now shooting its fifth series, she's not allowed to wear make-up, dye her hair, have a tan or even pluck her eyebrows, so she makes up for it when she takes off Mrs Patmore's apron.

'On the show, the ickier I look the better, so it's no surprise I pile the make-up on when I'm allowed to,' she laughs. 'When I met Shirley MacLaine [who plays Lord Grantham's mother-in-law Martha Levinson] in LA she said, "You don't look like you at all", because I was all dressed up. It doesn't half cheer you up.'

It's all a world away from the shy showbiz novice Lesley once was. She grew up just outside Manchester; her mother was an amateur actress while her father was a GP. 'I was painfully shy as a child,' she recalls.

'I never imagined I'd go into acting but I always loved drama and when I was 16 I discovered the Library Theatre up the road. So I plucked up courage and asked if I could watch rehearsals. It was like heaven. Then they asked if I wanted a part, and being on stage was like a bolt of lightning. My shyness disappeared. So I applied to the Guildhall drama school and I've been doing it ever since.'

Overcoming her shyness has no doubt been helped by Da'aboth, who she married seven years ago. They were introduced by a friend who believed he could help her.

Da'aboth, who was born David Keith Heald but changed his name to Da'aboth which means 'black bear', specialises in spiritual therapies. 'The more I got to know him it became clear he was for keeps,' she says.

'You know when someone isn't around and you wish they were? One of the most immediate things was he took over in my kitchen, and I was deeply grateful. I'm not brilliant and he's a natural cook.' Which is ironic given the grand concoctions Mrs Patmore produces for the Granthams.  

Perhaps the most life-changing aspect of her Downton fame, she says, is her work with Animals Asia, which campaigns against the cruel practice of Chinese farmers keeping bears in cramped cages and extracting their bile for use in traditional medicines.

Lesley got involved through fellow Downton actor Peter Egan, who plays Shrimpie, the Marquess of Flintshire.

'Peter said these bears get a hook into your heart, and it's true,' says Lesley. 'Thanks to Downton I got to go to a bear sanctuary. Even in rural China people watch the show and were excited to meet me, and that's a powerful position to be in. Women of a certain age say to me, "So there's hope for me yet", and I tell them, "Abso-blimmin-lutely!" People say you can't do this or that because you're too old, but I'm proof it's not true.'
