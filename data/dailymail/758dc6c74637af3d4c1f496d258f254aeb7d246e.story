Court documents 
signed by Aileen Wuornos, a chilling red handprint left by 'the killer 
clown' John Watne Gacy and an amulet made by 'Boston Strangler' Albert 
De Salvo  have gone on display as part of a bizarre exhibition in the 
United Kingdom.

Murderabilia
- which is housed at Littledean Jail in, Gloucestershire, also features
an original 'execution in progress' sign from the Leavenworth State 
Penitentiary in Kansas, a disturbing sketch of the devil with an axe 
through his head by Ottis Toole and shockingly, bars of soap made from 
human fat recovered from Auschwitz..

Andy
Jones - the 51-year-old owner and curator at the prison, which is now a
museum - said: ‘I'm more interested as a collector in the psychology of
these people, that's what fascinates me.

‘It's not a morbid fascination -
it's more that their letters give an insight into the twisted minds of 
these people. You can read evil within the contents of the letters, 
their drawings, their artwork.’

Gacy
was known as ‘the killer clown’ because of his role as an entertainer 
at children's parties. He was executed in 1994 for raping and murdering 
more than 30 boys and young men.

Mr
Jones said some of the content he has received over the years is too 
disturbing to put on public view, but some of the art looks more like 
the work of a retired pensioner than a cold-blooded killer.

The
'Boston Strangler' Albert DeSalvo, admitted to killing eleven 
Boston-area women between the ages of 19 and 67 who were sexually 
assaulted and killed between 1962 and 1964, crimes that terrorized the 
region and grabbed national headlines.

Eerie: Court documents signed by Aileen Wuornos, the American serial killer played by Charlize Theron in the 2003 film Monster, on display as part of the 'Muderabilia' exhibition at Littledean Jail in Gloucestershire

And serial killer Aileen 
Wuornos, who was executed over ten years ago for killing seven men and 
was  depicted by Charlize Theron in the 2003 movie "Monster" continues 
to fascinate the public.

Wuornos'
life story is as lurid as her crimes. She was raped and abused growing 
up in Michigan. Her father committed suicide in prison and her mother 
abandoned her. She began selling sex at an early age and classmates 
shunned her.

Her 
grandparents kicked her out at age 15 and she hitchhiked out of 
Michigan, eventually ending up in Florida, where she survived selling 
sex on the highways. She claimed she killed her first victim in 
self-defense after he raped her.

Jewellery: A necklace made by 'Boston Strangler' Albert De Salvo and sent directly to curator Andy Jones. DeSalvo admitted murdering 13 women in Massachusetts the 1960s, many of whom were elderly and alone

'It fills my heart with joy': A letter believed to be from Rose West to a friend, 'Paul', from her prison cell

Toole, who was 
born in Florida and claimed his satanic grandmother called him 'Devil's 
Child', said he had murdered more than 100 people along with crime 
partner Henry Lee Lucas. He died in 1996.

In
addition to the gruesome collection of American murderers, Jones also 
has a huge collection of some of the most infamous killers from the 
United Kingdom.

Rosemary 
West is one and she was jailed in 1995 for the ‘depraved’ murders of ten
young women mostly at the house in Gloucester she shared with her 
husband Fred, who committed suicide before he came to trial.

Armed: Andy Jones, owner of Littledean Jail and 
curator of the 'Muderabilia' exhibition, holding a 1918 issue army knife

In the collection: A well-worn WW2 flying jacket believed to have belonged to 'Muswell Hill murderer' Dennis Nilsen, who killed 15 young men between 1978 and 1983

The collection at the prison - built in 
1791 - includes a pink, heart-shaped hand-sewn cushion she reportedly 
made in jail, which Mr Jones said was passed to him by the 'Black Widow'
Linda Calvey.

Calvey got the nickname because each of her previous lovers has ended up dead or in prison.

Rare item: A hand-signed business card by the 19th century executioner William Marwood, the man who pioneered the 'long-drop' method of execution

Moneys: A handwritten and signed 1856 receipt from William Calcraft, the UK's most famous 19th century executioner, paid £12 and 12 shillings for carrying out an execution

Greeting: A hand-written Christmas message from Ethel, wife of murderer John Christie. Christie, of Notting Hill, west London, was sentenced to hang after murdering at least eight women - including Ethel

Shocking: Original 'human fat' soap used in the Nazi Holocaust death camps, alongside a coin, passed to Andy Jones by a curator at Auschwitz, on display as part of the exhibition

Scary: A view down the corridor at former prison and house of correction Littledean Jail, home of the exhibition

British murderer 
Michael Sams, for example, submitted two traditional paintings of steam 
trains. Sams was jailed for life in 1993 for murdering Julie Dart and 
kidnapping estate agent Stephanie Slater.

The
Murderabilia display forms part of the Crime Through Time collection at
Littledean Jail, a former house of correction, police station and 
courthouse turned visitor attraction.

The
collection also includes a number of historical artefacts, including 
the original hangman's noose used in 1885 in the failed attempt to kill 
John ‘Babbercombe’ Lee.

He 
was known as ‘The Man They Couldn't Hang’ after surviving three attempts
to execute him for murder. His sentence was later reduced to life 
imprisonment, but he was released in 1907.
