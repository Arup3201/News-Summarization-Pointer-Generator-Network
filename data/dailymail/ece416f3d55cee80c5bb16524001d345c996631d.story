As part of the build-up to the start of MailOnline's Fantasy Football season, we will be taking a look at players new to the Premier League with the potential to light up England's top tier over the coming campaign. 

BROWN IDEYE IN A NUTSHELL

West Brom have been crying out for a powerful striker ever since Romelu Lukaku's loan spell came to an end, and Ideye is there to fill the void.

The forward is strong, fast-paced, particularly good in the air, and has international and Champions League experience, too. His paperwork stalled his start with West Brom, but Ideye took part in his first training session after securing his eagerly-anticipated work permit and looks raring to go.

Statistics based on league appearances. 

WHY SHOULD YOU HAVE IDEYE IN YOUR MAILONLINE FANTASY FOOTBALL TEAM?

Plenty of eyebrows were raised when Ideye was bought by West Brom for £10m, but there's a good reason  the Baggies splashed the cash. 

Most importantly, he's a goalscorer.

Ideye proved it in Switzerland with Neuchatel Xamax, France with Sochaux, Ukraine with Dynamo Kiev, and will now try to keep up his record in England with West Brom.

It's easier said than done, of course, but you can bet this talisman  will get his name on the score-sheet on more than the odd occasion this year.

Lukaku's loan spell at West Brom saw him score 17 goals. Ideye, another handful of a striker, will look to prove just as worthy. And don't worry about the 25-year-old being a slow starter, either.

Upon his move to Switzerland, Ideye admitted he struggled with the cold weather. However, his two years there saw him hot enough in front of goal for Neuchatel Xamax, scoring 23 in 55 league games.

Bright starter: Ideye's debut season in England looks set to be decent and the striker may be worth backing

Neuchatel Xamax to Sochaux - £4m

Sochaux to Dynamo Kiev - £7m

Dynamo Kiev to West Brom - £10m 

THE DOWNSIDE  

The Premier League is a whole different kettle of fish to that of Ukraine, France and Switzerland. 

Yes, Ideye's risen in stock over the years from his records in front of goal, but bringing that to England may be too tough of an ask. After all, more expensive strikers have tried - and failed - over the years...

Then again, he may prove certain critics wrong and have a strong start as he has done elsewhere. The question is, do you feel lucky?

Proof required: Ideye should hit the ground running but there is always that risk in the Premier League

HOW HAS HE DEALT WITH BEING DELAYED? 

It's best to hear it from the frustrated man himself.

Ideye, speaking about his delayed work permit to the Express & Star, said: 'I've already put what happened behind me.

'Right now, I'm here and it's all about working, working, working. I've met the manager and met my new team-mates.

'The rest of (Friday) was all about recovery - some swimming and some running on the treadmill.'

Back: Ideye has met his manager and new team-mates, and says it is all about 'working, working, working'

WHAT'VE YOU GOT TO LOSE?

At £8.1m, Ideye looks a steal. That's cheaper than Papiss Cisse, Mauro Zarate, Enner Valencia, Shane Long, Joel Campbell, and plenty more.

At that price, Ideye may be worth backing - even as your third-choice striker! Join MailOnline's Fantasy Football game and get picking now!
