Johnny Lin is living the high life.

The Brisbane real estate agent is earning about $800,000 a year and he's only 27.

And he rewards himself by fine-dining with friends every night, indulgent holidays every few months and plans to retire in the next three years.

But life hasn't always been easy for the managing director of Harcourts Aspley - north of Brisbane - who worked 70 to 80 hours a week for the first three years of his career.

'I remember I was still living at home and had to borrow money from my parents at the start,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

'It wasn't easy. I went crazy over work and dropped everything for it. I pretty much gave up three years of my life.'

Johnny says he grew up knowing he'll be working in the business industry but he never even considered real estate until he stepped into a noodle shop in Aspley back in 2007.

'I had just about finished by engineering degree at the time but I knew I didn't to spend the rest of my life sitting behind a computer,' he said.

'One day I walked into a noodle shop and got talking to a real estate agent. Then he told me that I'd make a good agent, gave me his card and told me to give him a call.

'Two months later, I was working for him and I haven't looked back.'

But it's a choice he'll understandably never regret.

'My mum thought it was insane that I was giving up engineering because I had already graduated from it but I knew it was a risk I had to take when I was young,' Johnny said.

Within the first six months of starting at Harcourts Aspley, Johnny and a friend took over half the business.

'I was addicted to work,' he said.

'I'd be working 70 to 80 hours a week, going to work by 8am and coming home at about 9pm. Then I'd jump back on the computer at home and keep at it.'

And it appears the hard work has paid off.

'The last few years I made an average of about $800,000 in gross commission,' he said.

'Most recently I sold 83 properties and earned $810,000 in gross commission.'

Seven years later, Johnny has won over 150 awards - including the No.1 Sales Consultant in Brisbane, No. 2 Sales Consultant in Queensland and No. 7 Sales Consultant in Australia 2012/2013.

'I've got more trophies than I can keep in my office,' he said.

'But at the end of the day, money isn't everything. My ultimate goal is to be happy and I'm the happiest when I'm working.'
