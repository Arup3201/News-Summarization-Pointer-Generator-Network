Why are we still discussing whether the Millennium Stadium roof will be open on Friday night? Stuart Lancaster should have gone on the front foot on Monday and said England want it closed, putting huge pressure on the Welsh to comply.

If England are serious about winning the World Cup, they’ve got to be able to deal with these cauldron-like environments.

They should get the roof shut, crank up the pressure and go out there to silence 80,000 Welshmen.

England last played Wales under a roof two years ago, and they were crushed at the Millennium Stadium

But Stuart Lancaster could have sent a message by insisting his side want the roof closed on Friday night

England's record at the Millennium Stadium

I would be talking our team up, not talking about the noise. Nobody has ever lost to an atmosphere — and no crowd has ever won a game, either.

We had a similar situation before the 2003 World Cup. After beating New Zealand, we flew to Melbourne and immediately held a press conference.

One of the first questions asked, planted by me, was about the roof. The Australians had assumed we would want it open, to quieten the home crowd and bring into play the predicted wet conditions. I said to the journalists, ‘We want it shut . . . why would we want it open?’

We threw it back at them and went out there with an all-court team capable of playing with the ball in their hands — and we smashed them.

From a coaching point of view, if you know the conditions are going to be perfect, you can pick a certain team with confidence — a dangerously rapid team in England’s case.

Having the roof shut takes the conditions out of the equation and makes your job much easier, so long as your team has an all-court game — which England do possess.

It’s like Formula One; you have your wet-weather tyres and your dry-weather tyres. This is an opportunity for Lancaster to come out and say, ‘I want the roof shut and I’m going to pick my fast-track ponies’.

England can use the conditions to their advantage. They couldn’t match Wales for pace two years ago, but with the right team we’re now faster and more creative, if we play to our strengths. England can catch Wales cold. All the pressure is on the hosts because they are the favourites and they have a clean bill of health.

You have to ask why Wales have far fewer injuries and a lot of it comes down to the fact that the Welsh players know they’re in the team. They do not want to miss the Six Nations, they do not want to miss a World Cup.

In contrast, the England guys are all playing for their places and are unwilling to sit out any club rugby for fear of a rival having a good weekend, and it’s eventually caught up with them. That’s where England needed strong leadership, and education over injuries. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, let’s not mess it up.

But the injury myth is just a subplot. You can tell when teams are worried because they start doing a lot of talking. I am pretty sure Warren Gatland is worried, despite the confident move to name his team 48 hours ahead of schedule.

It’s all part of the theatre. England could have done the same and stopped people talking about them.

Now England’s key objective should be to go out there and really attack. To do that, they have to pick the right side. They should stop talking about injuries because, if anything, they have been a blessing in disguise.

We have ended up with a team who are clearly suited to the roof being shut and if you asked George Ford or Jonathan Joseph, I’m sure they would rather not be playing in the pouring rain.

There has been too much focus on England’s ‘lengthy injury list’ but, if I were picking the team, only two of the unavailable players would make it: Manu Tuilagi and Courtney Lawes.

Our bench is still much stronger than the Welsh bench and it comes down to whether the coaches have the experience and bottle to lay down a marker. We have a squad capable of winning the World Cup, let alone beating Wales.

These five Six Nations games should be treated like knockout football. In seven months, we will have must-win pool games against Wales and Australia, before a quarter-final, semi-final and a final.

The key to knockout football is coming away with points when you get into the opposition’s third of the field. Drop goals are key, while conceding penalties and yellow cards is fatal.

The best example is England in the semi-final of the 2003 World Cup against France. We killed them with drop goals. Every time we got into French territory, Jonny Wilkinson dropped a goal and we went back and started again. Out of desperation, France lost two men to the sin-bin, most crucially Serge Betsen.

We’ve got to pick a fast pack of forwards to win the ball, alongside real quality at Nos nine, 10 and 12 to get the ball in their third of the field. When you’re in their third of the field, you obviously want to score tries, but if you stall then you take the three points and start again.

That is what England must do. The best teams in the world would feed off Friday night’s partisan crowd, so let’s go out there and silence the Welsh.

Drop goals are key - Jonny Wilkinson against France in the World Cup semi-final in 2003 is a prime example
