Britain's largest surviving artillery piece is due to make an historic journey to the Netherlands to mark the 300th anniversary of the Treaty of Utrecht.

The Breach Loading 18-inch Rail Howitzer gun serial number L1 is one of just twelve railway guns left in the world. It was manufactured by the Elswick Ordnance Company set up in 1864.

The gun, which weighs 200 tons, has been on display at Larkhill, Wiltshire, since 2008 but today it began its 387-mile journey to the Dutch Railway museum.

Britain's largest surviving artillery piece, the Breach Loading 18inch Rail Howitzer gun, is being transported to the Netherlands for an exhibition to mark the 300th anniversary of the Utrecht Treaty

In 1940 an 18-inch Rail Howitzer Gun (pictured here at Ashbury Station), was stationed at Bishopsbourne, Kent on the Elham to Canterbury line as a defence against possible German invasion

There, the gun will be displayed as part of their War and Peace exhibition to commemorate the end of the Spanish War of Succession in 1713.

In preparation for the move the artillery piece, which was in service between 1920 and 1945, has undergone restoration work after a campaign to return it to good condition.

There are only twelve surviving railway guns in the world but the 200 ton Breach Loading 18inch Howitzer Serial No L1 is the largest surviving of all British artillery pieces

Today the Howitzer gun began its 387-mile journey to the Dutch Railway Museum where it will be part of the War and Peace exhibition

The War of the Spanish Succession (1701–1714) was fought between two alliances of European powers, including a divided Spain, over who had the right to succeed Charles II as king of Spain.

In 1704 an Anglo-Dutch force captured Gibraltor from Spain during the war of the Spanish succession.

The territory was then ceded to Britain under the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713.

It was signed by representatives of Louis XIV of France and Philip V of Spain, and representatives of Queen Anne of Great Britain, the Duke of 
Savoy, the King of Portugal and the United Provinces on the other.

Sergeant Maj Nick Shipton told the BBC it took up to five hours to get the gun off the carriageway and onto a truck.

'It's a complex beast. The size, 
weight and the fact that it has been together for a few years causes its
own issues. But we've done a lot of pre-preparatory work to make sure 
it can be split,' he said.

'It's most certainly going to be an abnormal load.'

Howitzer artillery pieces typically have relatively short barrels and use comparatively small propellant charges to propel missiles high into the air.

The barrels were built during the First 
World War but were completed too late to see action.

They were later used to 
test the accuracy of the 18-inch Howitzer in Shoeburyness, Essex.

Their relatively short range of around 13 miles meant that after the First World War the five guns produced were put into storage because longer range weapons were needed.

The Howitzer's range was insufficient for cross-Channel firing and hence it was never fired in action.

In late 1940 one 18-inch howitzer was brought out of retirement and fitted onto its 95 ton proofing sleigh.

It was deployed on the railway mounting Boche Buster which had been used in the First World War to carry a 14-inch gun.

The Breach Loading 18-inch Rail Howitzer gun serial number L1 was in service from 1920 to 1945.

It was one of five made in Britain by the Elswick Ordnance Company.

It weighs nearly 200 tonnes and its barrel measures 52ft.

The gun's shells weighed nearly 180 stone.

Elevation varied between 0° - 40° and its effective range was 13 miles.

It takes five hours to shift the gun from its carriageway over to the truck which transports it.

The gun was stationed at Bishopsbourne in Kent on the Elham to Canterbury Line as a coast defence gun.

It remained there until 1943 as a precaution against possible German invasion.

Barrel No L1 was the only one of Britain's railway guns to avoid being dismantled and scrapped in the early 1960s.

It was was sent back to Shoeburyness to test fire the efficacy of 1,000lb Bunker Buster Bombs before finally being retired in November 1959.

The Howitzer and proofing sleigh were moved to Woolwich, the then home of the Gunners, in June 1991, where it was gifted to the Royal Artillery Historical Trust.

After 17 years it was moved to Larkhill in 2008.

In the Netherlands the gun will form the centrepiece of the exhibition, to open on March 30 in a grand official opening ceremony involving many dignitaries.

It will remain there until September this year, before returning to the UK to a location yet to be confirmed.
