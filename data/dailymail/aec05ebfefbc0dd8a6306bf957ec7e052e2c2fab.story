The set designer behind the sea of poppies was yesterday forced to defend his work after an art critic used his blog on a Left-wing newspaper’s website to claim it was ‘trite’.

Tom Piper, who is acclaimed for his work with the Royal Shakespeare Company, said it was a powerful communal tribute to the vast loss of human life in the 1914-18 conflict.

He said: ‘This is not an installation about war, or an illustration of its violence and barbarity; it is about loss and commemoration that has given individuals a unique way to tap into their own family history and appreciate some of the human cost.’ 

Criticised: Guardian art critic Jonathan Jones said the poppy installation at the Tower of London is 'too pretty to communicate the grim realities of the First World War'

Mr Piper responded after Jonathan Jones, an art critic with the Guardian, derided the artwork – called Blood Swept Lands And Seas Of Red – as too pretty to communicate the grim realities of the First World War.

It represented, he sneered, ‘the inward-looking mood that lets Ukip thrive’.

He added: ‘In spite of the mention of blood in its title, this is a deeply aestheticised, prettified and toothless war memorial.’

His views appeared completely out of kilter with the nation, who have turned up to view it in their millions.

Poignant: Yeoman Serjeant Bob Loughlin walks through a mass of ceramic poppies which form part of the art installation 'Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red' at the Tower of London

Too popular: The general public has been urged to cancel planned visits to the Tower of London to see the magnificent poppy display as the site is becoming too overcrowded

Mr Piper, 49, said: ‘I would say it is a far subtler piece of work than people might take it for.

‘We are all inured to scenes of violence on TV and film, and one thing I have learned from theatre design is not to illustrate a play with the obvious. I think it a remarkably good thing that it is so accessible. We should not be trying to create something that is difficult to understand.’

The artwork is set to raise about £10million for six military charities, including the Royal British Legion, from the sale of each ceramic poppy for £25.

The poppies have been planted by volunteers since August and the installation, which has turned the moat into a sea of vermilion, has been visited by the Queen.

Prime Minister David Cameron said it was a ‘stunning display and extremely poignant’. Volunteers will start to take them away the day after November 11.
