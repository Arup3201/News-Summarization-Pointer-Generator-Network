The troubled Co-operative Group sparked outrage yesterday over plans to give senior staff ‘obscene’ pay deals despite the near collapse of its bank.

New chief executive Euan Sutherland is in line to get £3.66million – despite the fact that only last month he admitted that 2013 was ‘perhaps the worst year’ in the mutual’s 150-year history.

Richard Pennycook, the Co-op’s chief operating officer, will receive £1.8million in total. And a dozen senior executives will enjoy huge pay rises despite plans to cut 5,000 jobs and the biggest losses ever recorded by the group.

Pay deal: The Co-op is recommending that chief executive Euan Sutherland, who joined in May 2013 and heads the group's entire operation - from banking to supermarkets, should get a package worth a total of £3.66million

The Co-op is still reeling from the 
discovery of a £1.5billion black hole at its bank and a sex and drugs 
scandal involving former bank chairman and Methodist minister, Reverend 
Paul Flowers.

Later this 
month it is expected to reveal that it made a £2billion loss last year, 
and the group is reportedly interested in selling off its farms and 750 
pharmacies to make savings, which could mean between 4,000 and 5,000 
staff are laid off.

The revelations are embarrassing for the Labour Party, which has close links with the Co-operative movement.

The
 Co-op Bank has provided financial support to Labour for years and 32 
Labour MPs – including Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls – are also members of 
the Co-operative Party.

Yesterday,
 Shadow Treasury Minister Chris Leslie, one of the MPs sponsored by the 
Co-op, said: ‘I think the Co-op should be acting differently.

Accused: The bank's former chairman, the Reverend Paul Flowers was accused of buying class A drugs, including crystal meth, cocaine and ketamine - a horse tranquilliser also popular as a party drug.

'They
 recently put out a questionnaire to the public about their objectives 
and I didn’t see in it anything about, “Do you agree with extending high
 remuneration for senior executives”. So I have to say it is a bit 
disappointing.’

Luke Hildyard, head of research at the High Pay Centre, said: ‘This flies in the face of everything the Co-op stands for.’

Sarah
 Wilson, chief executive of Manifest, a corporate governance 
consultancy, said: ‘The membership is going to be shocked and feel let 
down.’

Co-op chairman 
Ursula Lidbetter defended the plans. ‘The remuneration packages of our 
executives are in the middle of a range of comparable companies,’ she 
said.

‘This represents an 
increase on the pay of their predecessors to reflect the greater 
commercial, management and turnaround experience they are bringing to 
bear.’

Comparison: The packages were put together after comparison with FTSE30 and FTSE100 companies of a similar size to the Co-op group, which includes its supermarkets and bank

Questions about the 
management of the 
bank, which came close to collapse and had to be rescued, were raised 
following drug revelations surrounding Mr Flowers, including why he had 
been given such an important role 
despite his lack of banking knowledge.

Last
 month Mr Sutherland said 2013 had been the worst year in the group's 150-year 
history, and warned that the forthcoming annual financial results would 
be 'difficult', and 'very ugly'.

According
 to The Observer, internal documents prepared for the Co-op's 
remuneration and appointments committee and marked 'private and 
confidential', suggested that Mr Sutherland would be paid a base salery 
of £1.5million, a £1.5million retention payment and pension contributions and other expenses.

Last year his predecessor, Peter Marks, was paid just over £1.3million.

The
 documents suggests that the financial package for Mr Sutherland, and 
other members of the executive team were needed because 'the [Co-op's] executive agenda is possibly the most complex one facing a large business in the country today'.

Chief operating officer Richard Pennycook with receive a £900,000
 salary and a matching retention 
payment, and six other executives will receive salaries and retention 
sums of between £500,000 and £650,000 - compared to previous figures of 
between £200,000 and £400,000.

The
 packages were put together after comparison with FTSE30 and FTSE100 
companies of a similar size to the Co-op, which is owned by its eight 
million members.

Ursula
 Lidbetter, Chair of The Co-operative Group, told MailOnline: 'Last year
 The Co-operative Group faced the biggest crisis in its 150-year history
 with the need to recapitalise its Bank.

'We saved the Bank, without 
recourse to the taxpayer and we are now embarking on the long and 
complex journey to revitalise the wider Group.

The Co-operative Group's £2billion losses expected to be announced on March 26, are believed to stem mainly from its banking division, as well as a reduction in the value of its supermarkets.

The bank had to be rescued at the end of last year, with US hedge funds and other investors emerging with control over the division.

It had merged with the Britannia building society in August 2009 and two years the bank announced a deal to take over 632 branches of LLoyds.

However, losses were building, partly down to commercial property and the Britannia's soured corporate loans, as well as a failed IT project.

The bank revealed an annual loss of £674million in March 2013 and abandoned the Lloyds deal.

Last May the bank's debt rating was downgraded by ratings agency Moody's and it was revealed that more than 10per cent of its commercial loans were 'impaired'.

The bank's chief executive Barry Tootell stepped down and in June the bank revealed there was a £1.5billion black hole.

'That means reducing debt,
 improving performance and streamlining a business that had become 
grossly inefficient. It is against that backdrop that we recruited Euan 
Sutherland and a top team with the skills and experience needed at this 
crucial stage in our history, reflecting the necessity for change.

'The 
remuneration packages of our executives are in the middle of a range of 
comparable companies.

'This represents an increase on the pay of their
 predecessors to reflect the greater commercial, management and 
turnaround experience they are bringing to bear.

'Euan and his team have 
already made a significant contribution to The Co-operative Group and we
 are confident that they will continue to do so.'

Although the bank's rescue was achieved 
without the need for help from the taxpayer,  70 per cent of it is now 
controlled by a group of US hedge funds and the restructuring left many 
customers with fears over its future direction.

Many customers chose to use the bank because of its ethical policy, which reflects their own concerns regarding issues such as animal welfare, the arms trade, genetic modification and human rights, as well as the fact that the group is owned and run by its members - who all have an equal say and share in the profits.

The Co-Operative group has previously said it is committed to preserving the bank's ethical focus, despite the presence of the hedge funds.

Lord Oakeshott, the former Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman and a Co-operative Bank customer said that managers at the group should only be 'well rewarded' after turning the business around. 

'Gigantic golden hellos for the new bosses send the wrong message to millions of loyal members, customers and staff,' he said.

Last week Barclays and state-backed Lloyds came under fire for rewarding senior executives in the wake of mis-selling scandals and plunging profits.

Both banks were criticised for pushing through rewards that jar with attempts to curb financial largesse, and MPs have previously 
condemned the ‘gut-churning’ scale of bonuses as bankers brought the 
economy to the brink of meltdown.

Barclays’ annual report showed chief 
executive Antony Jenkins could be 
paid up to a maximum of £7.2million this year, while Lloyds expects to 
pay boss Antonio Horta-Osorio a maxium package of £7.8million in 2014.

While Jenkins’ package is £1.4million lower than the maximum pay he was 
entitled to last year, more of his reward is guaranteed.

Barclays recently posted a 32 per cent fall in profit and caused controversy by increasing bonuses by 10 per cent.
Jenkins claimed the pay decision was vital to avoid the bank plunging into a ‘death spiral,’ as staff leave.

Barclays’ annual report also showed 481 staff were paid £1million or 
more last year with eight receiving more than £5million.
The lender tried to play this down by pointing out that 57 per cent of 
those paid at least £1million were based in America, with only 27 per 
cent in the UK.

Lloyds is seeking approval from shareholders to be able 
to pay key staff bonuses worth 200 per cent of their fixed pay, 
following on the heels of Barclays and HSBC.

Andrew
 Tyrie, chairman of the Treasury Select Committee, said last week: ‘It is 
regrettable that a number of banks appear not to have accepted the need 
for fundamental reform in this year’s bonus round.

‘The new consensus emerging on pay remains seriously flawed. It will now be up to regulators to do the job.’
