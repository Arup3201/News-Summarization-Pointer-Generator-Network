One in three UK residents will have an immigration background by the year 2060 according to new predictions by EU forecasters.

Up to 30million people will be first or second generation immigrants in 45 years a new Brussels report has revealed, with net immigration expected to rise to 12million.

The news comes as England was revealed as the second most crowded country in Europe, second only to Malta which is the EU's most densely populated member.

One in three UK residents will have an immigration background in 2060 new EU figures have revealed

The estimates, produced by the statistics agency Eurostat, are compiled in a report titled 'Fewer, Older and Multicultural? Projections of The EU Populations by Foreign/National background'.

It says: From the results it emerges that the European Union is going to experience unprecedented changes from the point of view of population composition.

'In a few decades, several countries will have to deal with relevant social changes.

UKIP deputy leader Paul Nuttall described the findings as 'startling'

'The growing diversity of the European population could therefore be considered a major socio-demographic challenge for the current century.'

The findings have been met with concern just days after visa restrictions for Bulgarian and Romanian immigrants were lifted.

Deputy leader of the UK Independence Party, Paul Nuttall, said: 'These projections are startling and just go to show that unless the Government gets serious about immigration the UK is headed towards severe overcrowding within 50 years.

The MEP told the Daily Express: 'With people living longer, public services would face an immense and I dare say unsustainable strain if we continue with loose borders.'

'Unless we want the very social fabric of the UK to change, we must leave the EU and take back control of our borders.'

Britain has the fourth-fastest growing population in Europe, with the second highest birth rate after Ireland.

By 2046, an estimated 494 people will be squeezed into every square kilometre of England compared with 411 now and only 374 when Tony Blair took power in 1997.

The equivalent figure for France will be just 115, for Germany 204 and the Netherlands 421.
