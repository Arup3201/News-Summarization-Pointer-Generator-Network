A lorry driver has been arrested after his vehicle overturned on the M25, closing a section of the motorway and leaving a workman fighting for his life.

The driver is suspected of causing serious injury by dangerous driving following the incident in Hertfordshire, which has left Britain's busiest motorways with long tailbacks.

The stretch of road which was shut is between junction 23 at South Mimms and junction 25 at the junction with the A10 north of Enfield.

Part of the road later reopened, but long delays have been reported in the area, raising the prospect of traffic chaos during the Friday evening rush hour.

Crash: A lorry has overturned in the middle of the M25 in Hertfordshire, injuring four people

Closed: The crash has led to the closure of the M25 between junction 23 and junction 25

Police,
firefighters and ambulance teams all attended today's incident which 
was between junction 24 at Potters Bar and junction 25.

The
driver of the lorry apparently lost control and swerved in the road, 
overturning the vehicle which fell onto workmen in the road.

No other vehicles were involved in the crash, which injured three road workers as well as the driver.

One man was taken to Addenbrooke's Hospital by Hertfordshire Ambulance Service, where he remains in a critical condition.

A second man airlifted to a central London hospital in a serious condition, a third man is being treated at in hospital for a leg injury and the fourth received treatment at the scene.

Two
of the victims had to be freed from the wreckage by rescue crews - one 
was trapped in the cab of the lorry, and the other was pinned under a 
barrier.

Chaos: This traffic map shows how the closure has brought gridlock to surrounding areas

Motorist Bruno Fernandes told the 
Evening Standard: 'You could see skid marks near the lorry where he lost
control and flipped over.

'One
of the roadworks supervisors was shouting at a woman saying there were 
two people trapped underneath and one had lost a leg.'

A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police said: 'Police have arrested a man on suspicion of causing serious injury by dangerous driving following the lorry overturning between junctions 24 and 25 on the M25.

'He remains in custody at a North London police station.'

Around midday, the Highways Agency said the closed section was likely to stay shut for most of the day

The agency has urged motorists to avoid the area if at all possible, or otherwise to allow extra time for all journeys.

On Tuesday, the M25 had to be closed between in exactly the same area after the driver of a lorry died when the vehicle overturned and caught fire near junction 25.
