A San Francisco 49ers player who was blasted by fans and his own team after a homophobic tirade on radio has issued a bizarre apology, claiming the comments were a 'reflection of thoughts in my head' but not representative of how he feels.

Chris Culliver, a cornerback with the 49ers, made the startling remarks during a radio interview this week with comedian and radio host Artie Lange - days before Sunday's Super Bowl.

During a strange line of questioning, Lange asked the 24-year-old: 'Do any gay guys approach you?'

Without so much as a pause to even think about the question, Culliver shoots back: 'I don't do the gay guys man. I don't do that.'

When asked if he believed there were any gay players on the 49ers roster, Culliver responded: 'No, we don't got no gay people on the team, they gotta get up out of here if they do.

He added: 'Can't be with that sweet stuff... Can't be... in the locker room man. Nah.'

'OK, so they'd have to keep it a secret?' Lange asks.

Culliver responds: 'Yeah, you gotta come out 10 years later after [retirement].'

A clip of the interview appeared on Yahoo! Sports.

The comments were immediately met with outrage from gay rights groups, 49ers fans and Culliver's bosses and teammates.

Later on Wednesday, the player backtracked, issuing a nonsensical statement of apology, blaming his behavior on the thoughts in his head.

'The derogatory comments I made yesterday were a reflection of thoughts in my head, but they are not how I feel,' he said.

'It has taken me seeing them in print to realize that they are hurtful and ugly. Those discriminating feelings are truly not in my heart. Further, I apologize to those who I have hurt and offended, and I pledge to learn and grow from this experience.'

Lange admitted that he asked about gay players in a 'goofy' barrage 'where I'm asking all sorts of stupid questions.'

Just days before the 49ers take on the Baltimore Ravens in the Super Bowl, Culliver's comments outraged the team's fans.

The team’s Facebook page was flooded with comments, telling the team to 'dump Chris Culliver' and  'hope Chris Culiver (sic) gets hurt and cannot ever play again.'

Facebook user Janice Weir wrote: 'Chris Culliver not only needs to be recognized as an ignorant homophobe, but also as completely inarticulate and an embarrassment for both San Francisco and for the University of South Carolina.'

While another, Brandon Hall, simply said in a comment: 'What Chris Culliver said disgusts me.'

In a statement on Wednesday, the team said: 'The San Francisco 49ers reject the comments that were made yesterday, and have addressed the matter with Chris.'

'There is no place for discrimination within our organization at any level. We have and always will proudly support the LGBT community.'

Outcry: Fans flooded the 49ers Facebook page to air their opinions and tell the team what they should do about Culliver

An advocacy group for gay athletes 
called the Last Closet said in a statement to sfgate.com that homophobia
 was still rife in professional sports.

'Culliver's comments are a perfect 
example of why there needs to be more discussion amongst the sports 
hierarchy about how to combat homophobia,' the statement read.

While the gay community may be up in arms over Culliver’s comments, they have a friend on the opposing team.

Baltimore Ravens linebacker Brendon Ayanbadejo has long been a supporter of gay rights and same-sex marriage, and said that he would use the Super Bowl spotlight to promote bullying awareness.

The progressive player told Yahoo! Sports on Wednesday that the issue of gay marriage is 'a little off the beaten path, but it's an issue that affects everybody.'

He said he has battled with acceptance coming from a biracial family and that gay people battling for equal rights is similar.

'It's all the same to me,' he said. 'It's the evolution in our society about acceptance. We don't want kids to be deterred from sports. I believe you're born the way you're born.'

In the history of the NFL, there has never been a player who has come out as gay during his career, though several have after their retirement.

Last year, former 49er Kwame Harris was arrested for allegedly assaulting a former boyfriend in Menlo Park, California. Until then, Harris was extremely private about his sexual orientation.
