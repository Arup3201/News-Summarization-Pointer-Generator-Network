It is a child's worst nightmare, living at school.

But few would mind their parents relocating to this 37-acre former boarding school - complete with an open-air swimming pool, tennis courts, and a caving centre.

On the market for £3 million, Howell's School in Denbigh, north Wales, has sparked a flurry of interest, with would-be buyers clamouring for the Grade II-listed structure.

Grandeur: This is the Grade II-listed main building of Howell's Independent Girls' School, which has gone on the market for £3 million after going into liquidation

Extravagant: Would-be buyers of the 37-acre estate in Denbigh, north Wales, could have their breakfasts in this open-plan dining hall once used by boarders

Common room: There would be no need to clamour for sofa space on a Saturday night in this living room - one of many across the five buildings on the site

The independent girls' school, which opened in 1859, closed in September last year when the company that took over the building went into liquidation.

H2000 was found to have almost £500,000 in debts in August 2013 - forcing the school to refund all deposits with just a month until the start of term.

Though external tutors are currently using the facilities to teach language lessons, the entire grounds could soon be transformed into a home.

Made up of five buildings, it includes three boarding houses and the former principal’s house along with the main block.

It covers 37 acres of the tranquil Vale of Clwyd and facilities include an open-air 
swimming pool, four tennis courts, squash courts, a climbing wall, a 
caving centre and an equestrian centre.

Historic: The oak-panelled hallways with spiralling staircases were built in 1859. The school acted as a haven for young ladies throughout both World Wars

Idyllic: Would-be buyers have rushed to register their interest in the sprawling estate which has four tennis courts, a swimming pool and even a caving centre

Dream playground: The vast plains of land set in the tranquil Vale of Clwyd have acted as a sports field for hundreds of pupils for more than a century

Making a school a home: The new owner will have the chance to change the purpose of the five buildings on the sprawling site from educational to private

Though it is currently registered for 'educational purposes', the new owner will have the chance to change it to 'private'.

The school, whose Latin motto was 'Only God be honour and glory', was originally built in 1858 for 55 boarders and 50 day girls.

It acted as a haven for hundreds of young ladies during both World Wars, where they escaped the atrocities and lived a sheltered life of sports games and creative arts.

By 2013, boarders paid £7,000-a-year, and day girls paid £4,000-a-year.

Former
 pupils at the school include actress Nerys Hughes, best known for her 
role in 70s sitcom The Liver Birds, and Steps singer Lisa Scott-Lee.

Ace: Would-be buyers could host a mini tennis tournament in their back garden with this impressive set of courts set behind the historic turrets of the house

Quaint: Shrouded in a cluster of luscious trees, this comparatively small building with floor-to-ceiling windows was once home to Howell School's principal

Giddy up: Let's hope the new owner has plenty of hobbies or this state-of-the-art equestrian centre, with balconies to watch the action, will go to waste

Take a dip: This is the brick building that encloses the open-air swimming pool on a hill in the Vale of Clwyd, with a set of wooden climbing bars outside

It has been listed for sale by Jackson Stops and Staff who said the property is unlike any other.

Crispin Harris, from the estate agent, said: 'It has only just been advertised but we are receiving a lot of interest.

'At
 present it is designated for educational purposes and any purchaser 
would have to consider whether to apply for planning consent for change 
of use.'
