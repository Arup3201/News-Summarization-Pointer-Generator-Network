The boyfriend of an Arkansas police dispatcher who was killed nearly two years ago has been arrested in Colorado and charged with first-degree murder.

Kevin Duck, 30, is accused of killing Dawna Natzke, a Hot Springs Village police dispatcher who was last seen leaving a holiday party with Duck around 11pm on December 21, 2011.

Volunteer searchers found her body on New Year's Eve in a remote area of the Ouachita National Forest, about 5 miles from where her burned-out station wagon had been found days earlier.

On Tuesday, Garland County Sheriff's Lt. James Martin said Duck was arrested without incident in the Burlington, Colorado, area. He is being held on $250,000 bond.

According to Duck's arrest warrant, Dawna Natzke likely died from blunt force trauma and drowning three or four hours after leaving the party with her boyfriend. 

The FBI has been able to determine that Duck used his cell phone in the area where Natzke's body and burned out vehicle were dumped just 30 minutes apart.

Natzke, 46, had worked at the police station seven years. At age 35, she donated a kidney to her father, prolonging his life by 10 years, according to the preacher at her funeral.

Friends said she built her life around her sons: two who played football at Jessieville High School at the time of her death and an older son who lived nearly.

Duck told detectives in 2011 that the couple returned to Natzke's home after the holiday party and that she was gone when he awoke the next morning.

‘The best we know, he was just angry with her, when they left the party he was just angry,’ Oliver said.The two had arrived at the party together, along with Natzke's mother, in Natzke's car, according to Oliver.

Person of interest: Duck, seen here in a mugshot in an unrelated probation case, wasn't initially named a suspect in Natzke's death, but his own father said he was the 'only person of interest'

‘She was seen leaving with Mr. Duck. He was kind of leading her out. He wasn't pushing her, just kind of leading her out’ he said. ‘She left her mother behind and her purse.’

A friend, Patty Hathaway, told The Associated Press in early 2012 that, shortly after Natzke's disappearance, she had received an odd text message from the woman's phone.

Hathaway said she had texted Natzke the day after the party to say she wasn't pleased with how Natzke's boyfriend had ‘pushed’ her out the door.

Nearly two hours later, Hathaway 
received a text from Natzke's phone, saying: ‘He didn't push me i fell 
and he caught me. I had taken a pain pill and was tour up.’

Hathaway said she didn't believe Natzke wrote the message. ‘I know she knows how to spell,’ she said then.

Natzke's disappearance went unreported 
until December 23, when she didn't show up for her 6am shift in what 
would have been her first day back at work after the party.

Duck's arrest warrant cited by ABC News stated that the 30-year-old came to work at a car service station late the next day after his girlfriend’s disappearance and took little interest in searching for her. 

Luther Duck, Kevin's father, told KATV 
last February that his son was 'the only person of interest' in the 
case, and suggested that it was only a matter of time before he is 
brought to justice.

Doris Smith, Dawna's mother, told THV11 Tuesday that she has been waiting for two years to hear that her daughter’s suspected killer was arrest. 

'You never have peace with yourself,' an emotional Miss Smith said. 'I haven't been able to sleep until it's daylight. I just wander around, rewatching television shows that I've already seen...'

Smith, who had lost her husband just months before Dawna's killing, said she has been afraid to leave her home knowing that her daughter's killer was still at large.
