A man has taken another hostage at gunpoint and forced him to wear an ‘explosives vest’ in a Brazilian hotel.

The armed man thought to be a public official from the Brazilian state of Tocantins entered the Saint Peter Hotel in Brasilia at 7.30am today and grabbed his victim, variously said to be a hotel employee or a guest.

The assailant dragged his victim onto the balcony of a room on the 13th floor

He dragged him onto the balcony of a room on the 13th floor where he began demanding that President Dilma Rousseff resigns office. Around 300 guests were inside the hotel at the time, but have since been evacuated. There are 400 rooms over 15 floors in the building.

Three negotiators are in place trying to talk the man down without him setting off the explosives. Indeed, no one is sure if the explosives are genuine.

Special Forces are also on the scene assessing the situation.
