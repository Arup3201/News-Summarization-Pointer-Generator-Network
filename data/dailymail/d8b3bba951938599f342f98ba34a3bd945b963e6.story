In some postcodes £650,000 would be just enough for a modest family home.

But in other areas you get a lot more for your money. Proving once again that location is everything in property, that same sum could also buy this 21-bedroom country mansion.

The 18th century home in six acres of land has had almost half-a-million knocked off its asking price.

Cilwendeg House is located in rolling Welsh countryside a few miles from where Prince Charles has a country retreat, and as well as the huge number of bedrooms, comprises four large reception rooms, two matching conservatories, offices and servants’ quarters.

Cut price mansion: Cilwendeg House, in North Pembrokeshire, which is on the market for just £650,000 - the same price as a one-bedroom flat in London

Luxury: The interior of the Welsh mansion which is on sale for just £650,000 - the price of a one-bedroom London flat

According to the estate agent’s blurb, it has ‘splendid Doric and Ionic columns, ornate window surrounds, quoins and a host of other architectural features which create a magnificent impression’.

The property near the farming village of Boncath in Pembrokeshire, was built in the 1780s by the son of a wealthy lawyer who wanted a grand country pile.

It was bought by Pembrokeshire Council in 1952 and used as a retirement home until it closed in 2010.

Estate agent Anthony Clay said: ‘You try to find a property like Cilwendeg House anywhere else for this price and, quite frankly, you’ll fail.

Rolling countryside: Cilwendeg House is set in six acres of land. It was used as a residential home for the elderly until three years ago

No interest: The historic home has been on the market for £1.1million but didn't attract a buyer at that price

Repair job: The historic property has been used as a home for the elderly since the 1950s but could be converted back into a private dwelling

Rundown: The kitchen in the 21-bedroom mansion which will need some refurbishment to be returned to its former glory

Indoor garden: Cilwendeg House, in North Pembrokeshire, Wales, which has been dubbed a cut-price Downton Abbey

‘It is a really, really good price for the right person.’

He added: ‘It may not have sold due to worries over a possible mansion tax, which may or may not come into force in the future.

‘But at this price someone is going to get a real bargain.’

Last month it emerged an end-of-terrace former squat in London sold for £80million in one of Britain’s biggest-ever property deals.

The house, opposite Regent’s Park, is spread over 21,500 sq ft and was once the home of the New Zealand High Commissioner.

Luxury fittings: The property didn't attract a buyer when it was put up for sale at £1.1million a year ago

Contrast: A one-bedroom flat is also on the market for £650,000 in this block in Marylebone, central London - the same price as a 21-bedroom mansion in Wales

It boasts a mixture of classic and contemporary features from marble and limestone-lined halls to iPad-controlled lighting.

There is also a sports complex which includes a gym and swimming pool and the high-tech gates have an automatic number plate recognition system.

Also last month sellers of another London residence had to slash the asking price by £35million.

Edwardian mansion Heath Hall, which has been on the market since 2011, had an original price tag in the region of £100million, and boasts a library, cinema, gym and wine cellar as well as 14 bedrooms.

The price was dropped to a ‘more realistic’ £65million.
