Luoyan Luoyang Intermediate People's Court heard how he built a dungeon in his basement in 2009.

The women, who had worked at nightclubs and karaoke bars, were tricked into going there and then held captive.

He forced them to work as prostitutes and perform in pornographic web shows as well as repeatedly raping them.

The women were imprisoned in the dungeon for between two and 21 months.

Two of the six were found dead when a 23-year-old woman escaped and led police to the basement.

He had instructed three women to kill 
two of the other captives, but they were given leniency for their role 
in the murders as they took place in extreme circumstances.

One received three years and the two others were put on probation, according to Xinhua.

Prior to his imprisonment, Li had been a clerk for Luoyang's technological supervision bureau.

When he was arrested last year he had a wife and an eight-month-old baby
