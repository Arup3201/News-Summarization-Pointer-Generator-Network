This lane is only 6ft wide and has a sign to warn off larger vehicles, so you  might have thought truck drivers would steer well clear.

But to the dismay of resident Caroline Cockman, some just blindly follow their  satnavs – getting themselves stuck and damaging her beautiful Grade II-listed home.

She estimates that lorries have so far caused around £50,000 damage to her side and garden walls, and to her neighbour’s wall on the opposite side.

Caroline Cockman said she has lost count of the number of lorries that have become stuck in her lane or damaged her property 

The homeowner, who has lived at the property for 23 years, said drivers of large vehicles ought to know better

Yesterday the 54-year-old, who lives 
in a former Georgian mill house, said: ‘Their satnavs direct them down 
the lane.

They ignore the evidence of their own eyes that it’s too 
narrow and just carry on until they get stuck

‘The
 worst incident happened in 2008 when a big lorry got stuck then tried 
to ram its way down, costing £13,000 in repairs.

'There have been so many
 incidents, I can’t remember them all. Several have caused £5,000 
damage.

'I’ve started claiming off my own insurance because it was so 
slow claiming third party from the driver’s insurance.

‘It’s heartbreaking because as soon as something is repaired it’s just a matter of time before it gets damaged again.’

In the past week three motorists ran into trouble on the small, narrow lane in Coxley, Somerset 

Over the years Ms Cockman said around £50,000 worth of damage has been done to her home and grounds 

Sometimes the homeowner does not even have the chance to see the culprit, and they get out of the situation 'scot free'

There
 is a sign at the top of the lane in Coxley, near Wells, Somerset, 
warning drivers of the width restriction.

But Miss Cockman, who has 
lived there for 23 years, wants the council to make it more prominent.

Three
 trucks have got stuck in the last week alone, she said. One driver had 
to get in and out of the cab through a window while they waited four 
hours for a rescue vehicle to arrive.

Garden
 designer Miss Cockman added that she believes the problem is partly 
down to some drivers still using domestic satnavs designed for cars, 
rather than specialist satnavs for commercial vehicles.

‘I’m told the commercial ones do carry warnings about the lane’s width but the domestic ones don’t,’ she said.

'Sometimes I’ve come home and the damage has been done and the driver has gone and got away scot free. 

'Luckily I’ve got a neighbour who works from home who can now get the driver details of most incidents when they happen.

'But I’ve started claiming off my own insurance because it was so slow claiming third party from the driver’s insurance - things would drag on and on because it was lower priority.

The homeowner has lived at the property for 23 years and has faced 'countless' problems, she says 

Despite hearing from council representatives, little is being done to solve the problem in Coxley, Somerset 

Council officials say the road signs are obvious enough despite repeated incidents. Three motorists in just one week have had trouble at the site 

Ms Cockman said drivers of lorries and vans should pay more attention to the road than to their sat nav 

On one occasion a driver caused £33,000 worth of damage after getting stuck in the lane and damaging the wall

The council said the sign is clearly marked enough though Ms Cockman says more needs to be done 

'Last Monday
 we had a big sewage tanker, with an escort to make sure it travelled 
safely, and it took him half-an-hour to reverse out.

'Then on Wednesday night someone collided with our low wall which stops vehicles coming off the lane and into our courtyard.

'Another guy was trapped for six hours. If only truck drivers used their common sense as the lane got narrower and narrower.

'You would think they ought to know better.'

'There needs to be more prominent signage at the top of the lane.

'I’ve had visits from council representatives who are sympathetic and make all the right noises but nothing ever gets done.

'It’s heartbreaking because as soon as something is repaired it’s just a matter of time before it gets damaged again.'

A spokesman for Somerset County council said there were enough warnings in place to avoid lorries getting stuck in the lane. 

'There are already signs in place at this location and we recommend drivers pay attention to these.'
