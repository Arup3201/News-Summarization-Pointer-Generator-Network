Concerns: Ofsted chief Sir Michael Wilshaw has said children in Birmingham are being denied a 'rounded education' because of alleged Islamic practices in schools

Teachers are to be offered training to stop extremist and radical elements making their way into classrooms.

Ofsted are planning to give school staff guidance in a bid combat the problems raised in the recent Trojan Horse scandal, according to a source at the Department for Education.

It comes as around 20 schools in Birmingham are facing allegations that Muslims in senior positions have segregated boys and girls in classrooms, refused to teach sex education and have forced some female students to wear head scarfs.

As a result, six schools, including Park View Academy, are understood to have been placed in special measures after they received damning reports into how they are run.

Ofsted chief Sir Michael Wilshaw is expected to highlight the problems across the city when the schools' inspections are published.

According to The Sunday Times, he will also claim that children are being denied a 'rounded education' to prepare them for life as a Brit.

Only two schools are thought to have been given positive feedback.

Ninewells Academy has been described as having 'outstanding' management and its executive principle is said to have an 'extensive knowledge about the risk of radicalisation and extremism'.

Washwood Heath Academy is believed to have been rated as 'good', but may require further inspection.

Education secretary Michael Gove has written to all schools 
and colleges in England urging them to watch out for signs of 
radicalisation in the wake of the so-called Trojan Horse plot.

The plot involves the alleged ousting of 
headteachers, mainly in and around the Birmingham area, by Islamic 
extremists attempting to take over several top schools in a bid to 
target vulnerable young people.

Controversy: Park View School, which is at the centre of the Trojan Horse plot allegations, has been accused of segregating women and children during lessons

Heads in the city were told at a recent 
council meeting to expect a ‘bloody firestorm’ after investigations into
 the Trojan Horse allegations are published.

One of the most high-profile schools 
involved in the claims, Park View Academy in Birmingham, has been 
condemned for increasing ‘Islamisation’.

It is claimed the school has hosted extremist preachers during assemblies and encouraged girls to cover their hair.

The school was recently subject to an emergency investigation by schools watchdog Ofsted and was put in to special measures.

Last week, Ofsted announced inspections were investigating a further three schools, bringing the total to 21.

A spokesman for the watchdog said they will not be commenting before the reports on the schools are due to be published.

The Department for Education also said they would not be commenting on the speculation.
