President Barack Obama warned on Monday that the U.S. military's missions in Iraq, while limited, will remain an open-ended campaign at least until newly minted Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi has established an 'inclusive government' that can appeal to his nation's warring religious and ethnic sects.

Asked if he worried about 'mission creep' growing out of an offensive that has seen 68 airstrikes to date, Obama replied that he refuses to be pinned down to a timetable.

'I don't think ... at this point, that I'm prepared to provide a blanket answer to that,' he told reporters at the White House. 'A lot of it depends on how effectively the Iraqi government comes together.'

No timetable: Obama said Monday that completing America's anti-ISIS mission would depend largely on the job Haider al-Abadi does in creating an 'inclusive government' that inspires confidence among warring Iraqi religious groups and tribes

'This is going to take time,' Obama 
added. 'There are going to be many challenges ahead. Meanwhile, there 
should be no doubt that the United States military is going to continue 
to carry out the limited missions I have authorized.'

U.S. Central Command said Monday that it 'has conducted a total of 68 airstrikes in Iraq' since August 8, when Obama first authorized them. A Pentagon official told MailOnline that the number would soon be elevated to a total of 72.

That figure is small by the standards the U.S. has established in previous Middle Eastern conflicts. At their peak in 2011, U.S. airstrikes in Afghanistan reached a total of 5,411.

Still it indicates that the commander-in-chief is willing to bring a strategic hammer down on ISIS, the terror group that claims it has established an Islamic 'state' across portions of sovereign Iraq and Syria.

CENTCOM said about half of its airstrikes to date came in the last few days as Iraqi military forces drove ISIS away from the Mosul Dam, a key piece of infrastructure that could have been used as a tool of terror if it were intentionally breached.

Fifteen strikes near the dam, the Pentagon said, were carried out by drones.

The sense of urgency Obama said he has communicated to al-Abadi is driven in part by a desire to remove American armed forces from the Iraqi theatre.

'I have been firm from the start that we are not reintroducing thousands of U.S. troops back on the ground to engage in combat,' he said Monday.

'Iraq is going to have to ultimately provide for its own security.'

Leaving American armed servicemen and women in place to protect ethnic and religious minorities from a rampaging ISIS is 'not sustainable,' Obama insisted. 'It's not lasting.'

The Mosul Dam is the largest such structure in Iraq, making it a ticking time-bomb in the hands of ISIS, but it was recaptured on Monday

ISIS, an acronym for the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, has grown 'from a band of 2,000 thugs to a 30,000+ terrorist army,' former Reagan administration Pentagon deputy KT MacFarland said Monday, 'equipped with state-of-the-art military equipment seized from Iraqi Army deserters.'

The terror group 'now controls large swaths of Syria and Iraq, has $2 billion in cash and assets, $3 million in daily revenue and controls oil fields and dams, which means it controls most of the water and electricity in Iraq,' she said.

And its army 'is butchering, raping and beheading anyone who stands in its way.'

Obama, however, remains focused on ensuring that Baghdad has an egalitarian government that caters equally to the complaints of Sunnis, Shias and Kurds.

'They’ve got to get this done,' he told reporters, 'because the wolf’s at the door. And in order for them to be credible with the Iraqi people, they’re going to have to put behind some of the old practices and actually create a credible, united government.'

'We've made significant progress on that front, but we're not there yet,' he conceded.

Not staying: An open-collared Obama insisted that he won't be dragged into a Bush-style Iraq wa, insisting that 'we are not reintroducing thousands of U.S. troops back on the ground to engage in combat'

Al-Abadi, the president said, will help ensure America's national security by 'making sure a savage group that seems willing to slaughter people for no rhyme or reason other than they have not kowtowed to them, that a group like that is contained, because ultimately it can cause a threat to us.'

He seemed to be pinning his hope for a smooth exit from Iraq on the belief that Sunni Muslims, a minority group in Iraq, will embrace a strong al-Abadi government and stand up to the murderous ISIS hordes that have overrun parts of the country that they had long controlled.

With the success of a credible governing coalition, he said Monday, 'there's the prospect of Sunni tribes who are the primary residents of areas that ISIL now controls, saying, "We've got a viable option".'

'"And we would rather work with a central government that appears to understand our grievances and is prepared to meet them",' he suggested they might conclude, '"rather than deal with individuals who don't seem to have any values beyond death and destruction".'

Appearing for his second press conference in a row without a necktie, a tired-looking Obama has taken a few days off from his Martha's Vineyard vacation to receive in-person briefings on the Iraq crisis, and on the continuing civil unrest in Ferguson, Missouri.
