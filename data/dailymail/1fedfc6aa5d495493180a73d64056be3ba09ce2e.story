Tixylix medicines have become the latest in a string of products to be recalled over fears they may contain pieces of plastic.

A number of Tixylix medicines, including some for toddlers and babies, have been recalled by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

While no adverse effects have yet been noted in people who have taken the drugs, the health watchdog has issued a 'precautionary' recall.

Tixylix medicines have become the latest in a string of products to be recalled over fears they may contain pieces of plastic

The news comes the day after Boots extended a medicine recall due to concerns over contamination with plastic cap parts.

Tixylix manufacturer, Novartis, alerted officials to a possible fault in the manufacturing process of the seal that might have resulted in small pieces of plastic being found in the liquid medicines.

Adam Burgess, the MHRA's head of Defective Medicines Reporting Centre, said: 'This is a precautionary recall and there is currently no evidence that people have had any problems with these medicines.

'If people have bought Tixylix we ask that they check the batch number on the bottle label next to the expiry date to see if it is one of the batches being recalled. If anyone has an affected batch they should return it to the place of purchase for a refund.

'If people do have any questions they can contact Novartis on 0800 854 100 or visit tixylix.co.uk'

The batches being recalled are Tixylix Toddler Syrup 100ml PL 00030/0150, Tixylix Toddler Syrup 150ml PL 00030/0150, Tixylix Baby Syrup 100ml PL 00030/0150, Tixylix Blackcurrant Flavour Syrup 100ml PL 00030/0150 and Tixylix Chesty Cough 100ml PL 00030/0082.

The batches being recalled are Tixylix 
Toddler Syrup 100ml PL 00030/0150, Tixylix Toddler Syrup 150ml PL 
00030/0150, Tixylix Baby Syrup 100ml PL 00030/0150, Tixylix Blackcurrant
 Flavour Syrup 100ml PL 00030/0150 and Tixylix Chesty Cough 100ml PL 
00030/0082

Yesterday, Boots extended a safety recall linked to thousands of bottles of children’s medicine to six more big-selling products.

The
 original recall was made two weeks ago and also came after the firm was 
alerted to a manufacturing fault associated with the tamper-proof 
plastic seals around the caps.

The concern is that parts of the seal may have fallen into the medicine as a result, creating the risk of a choking hazard.

The
 new recall relates to products that are sold to very young babies, 
including Boots Pharmaceuticals Gripe Mixture - 1 Month Plus (150ml); 
and Boots Pharmaceuticals Paracetamol 3 Month Plus 120mg/5ml Suspension 
Strawberry Flavour in 100ml and 200ml bottles.

Also
 being withdrawn are Boots Pharmaceuticals Tickly Cough Relief Oral 
Solution (150ml); Boots Pharmaceuticals Paracetamol 6 Years Plus 
250mg/5ml Suspension (100ml) ; and Boots Pharmaceuticals Cough Syrup 3 
Months Plus (100ml).

Danger: Boots has extended a mass-recall of children's medicine to six more products after faults are found with the machine that puts the plastic seal on the bottles

Customers are being asked to return the products to the store to claim a refund.

A
 spokesman said: ‘The health and safety of our customers and patients is
 always our highest priority, with exceptional quality and care at the 
heart of how we support them every day.

‘In
 November 2013, we discovered a potential manufacturing fault with the 
tamper seal on some Boots Pharmaceuticals liquid medicines, which might 
result in small pieces of plastic being found in the medicine.   

‘Following
 further in-depth investigations, we have found that this issue may have
 affected other products produced on the individual production line so 
we have taken the precautionary action of asking customers to return 
several other items.

‘Whilst
 we’re still not currently aware of any customer incidences, nor have we
 found any in our customer care database, we have taken the decision to 
ask customers to return these products to our stores for a full refund.

Three of the affected products are: Boots Pharmaceuticals Paracetamol 6 
years Plus 250mg/5ml Oral Solution 200ml, Boots Pharmaceuticals 
Ibuprofen 3 Months plus 100mg/5ml Oral suspension Strawberry flavour and Boots Pharmaceuticals Chesty Cough Relief 100mg/5ml Oral Solution

‘We’re
 sorry for any inconvenience this may cause and would like to offer our 
reassurances that these actions are taken as a precaution only.’

Customers who have any questions or concerns can call Boots Customer Care on 0800 915 0004.

The
 original November recall related to Boots Pharmaceuticals Chesty 
Cough Relief 100mg/5ml Oral Solution, Boots Pharmaceuticals Dry Cough 
Relief Oral Solution, Boots Pharmaceuticals Mucus Cough Relief 
100mg/5ml Oral Solution, Boots Pharmaceuticals Paracetamol 6 years 
Plus 250mg/5ml Oral Solution 200ml and Boots Pharmaceuticals Ibuprofen 3 
Months plus 100mg/5ml Oral suspension Strawberry flavour.
