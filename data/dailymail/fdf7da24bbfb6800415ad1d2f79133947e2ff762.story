A 33-year-old Massachusetts woman has been convicted of indecent assault and battery after a jury heard she 'created her own house of horrors' at the home of two children she was babysitting.

Crystal Goodis, of Norton, was hired by a mother to babysit her then-four-and-a-half year old daughter and three-year-old son in 2009. The mother testified that she stopped engaging her services three months later after noticing changes in her children.

Goodis was convicted after a two-day trial by a jury
of three men and three women and Judge Debra Shopteese ordered her to 
serve 18 months of a two-and-a-half year sentence.

Ghoulish: Goodis' interest in the horror genre was used as evidence in the court that she dressed up in scary costumes to scare her two charges, a four-year-old girl and a three-year-old boy

According to the Sun Chronicle, the mother hired Goodis, who was the daughter of a co-worker and friend of her mother, to babysit in the spring of 2009.

The mother testified that she terminated Goodis' employment after her daughter locked herself in a closet 
and screamed uncontrollably after kicking Goodis in the shin so hard she
had to use an ice-pack.

The mother said her daughter also began wetting the bed, her son displayed nervous tics and both children began suffering nightmares.

The children testified that Goodis had punched and kicked them on the first day she babysat them in 2009, and the girl, now aged 8, said Goodis touched her private areas. The boy, now 6, told the court that the defendant laid on top of him.

According to the Sun Chronicle, Goodis is an enthusiast of the horror genre. She showed the children horror films, the court heard, and dressed up in vampire and werewolf costumes to scare them.

The children's mother said she was not aware of the abuse until 10 months after it occurred when she caught her daughter acting out inappropriate behavior.

The girl testified that she and her brother had not told their parents about the abuse earlier because Goodis had threatened to come back and hurt them if they told anyone. 

'This woman created her own house of horrors at their home in Norton,' Assistant District Attorney Karin Welker told the jury.

Goodis denied the charges against her and spoke out in her own defense. She told the court the allegations were made up by the children.

'Absolutely not. I would never do anything like that, ever. I’m not the type of person who could do anything like that,' Goodis said when her lawyer, Paula Plouffe, asked her whether she had committed the abuse.

She said that although she'd worked 
for horror-themed businesses during Halloween, she'd never been allowed 
to take any costumes home, and the work had occurred before she began 
babysitting the children.

Goodis
admitted in court to initially denying knowing her accusers until 
pressed by detectives, but said she was nervous and felt intimidated by 
police. She also admitted she'd last babysat when she was a teenager.

Plouffe said the 
children had made up allegations of abuse against her client because 
they preferred a previous babysitter, and blamed Goodis for losing her. 
She said the 'inappropriate behavior' demonstrated by the girl could 
have been learned from someone else.

The Twitter feed belonging to Goodis expresses a love of the zombie TV show The Walking Dead and makes no mention of the trial. Her last tweet was on June 9.

Goodis was placed on probation for 20 years, must register as a sex 
offender and give a DNA sample, and undergo a sex offender and mental health
evaluation.

Once released from prison, Goodis will have to abide by probation conditions including having no contact or employment with children under 12, and must stay away from children, including her own nieces and nephews, until she's completed her sex offender counseling.

'We need to let people know this cannot be tolerated,' the mother said in her victim-impact statement.

She said the children were undergoing counseling at St Anne's Hospital in Fall River and that the family had drawn closer together in the aftermath of the abuse and were hoping for a punishment suitable for someone with the responsibility of caring for children.

'We need to let people know this cannot be tolerated,' the mother said.

Goodis' mother and a friend who testified in her defense left the courtroom in tears following the verdict, while Goodis received the news stoically with an expressionless face, reported the Sun Chronicle.
