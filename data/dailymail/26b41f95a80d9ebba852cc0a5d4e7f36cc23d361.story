A woman who has spent 13 years trying to find a couple whose wedding photo she discovered in the rubble of 9/11 got the thrill of a lifetime yesterday when she finally got to speak to someone from the picture, and learn that all are alive and well.

Every year since the horrible attacks took place in NYC, Elizabeth Stringer Keefe has posted a scanned image of a photograph of six people at a wedding, and each year she got no response.

Until this year.

Lost and found: After 13 years of searching, Elizabeth Stringer Keefe spoke to someone in this photo found in the rubble of the World Trade Center, and learned all are alive and well

Owner: The photo of the wedding snap belonged to Fred Mahe, who worked at the World Trade Center 

 'Attention wonderful world: ALL SIX PEOPLE ARE ALIVE AND WELL AND I HAVE JUST SPOKEN TO ONE OF THEM!!!!!!!!!!! #Happyending #911photo,' Ms. Keefe tweeted yesterday. 

The man she located was the photo's owner, Fred Mahe, who had it on his desk on the 77th floor of 2 World Trade Center when the building collapsed back in 2001.

He is pictured in the background of the photo, taken at a friend's wedding. 

The photo came into Ms. Keefe's possession back in October of 2001, when a friend who uncovered it in some of the rubble near the sight passed it off to her, and asked that she do something meaningful with it.

And after 27,000 retweets from the likes of Blake Shelton yesterday, that something meaningful finally happened she was able to speak to Mr. Mahe, who still lives in NYC with his wife, Keri.

He was quick to thank both Mr. Shelton and Ms. Keefe on Twitter.

'It's a beautiful, joyful moment captured in time and it was such a contrast to what I saw at Ground Zero, which was still burning when I was there,' Ms. Keefe told Mashable. 

'So, if it had a relationship to 9/11, I wanted to keep it safe until I could return it to its owner. There's so much beauty and happiness in the photo that I just felt committed to the task.' 

'Every year I go dig it out,' Keefe told The Boston Globe. 'I’ve been posting it for years, and it’s literally never gone anywhere.'

'I’ve never dismissed the idea that it could just be a photo that was in a neighboring building that had its windows blown out,' Keefe also told the newspaper. 'I’ve tried over the years to resist putting a story to it.'
