91-year-old Catherine Vowles receives silk flowers from her nurse Norah Charlesworth

A hospital is the first in the UK to install a silk flower vending machine to get around a ban on fresh bouquets in wards.

The machine has been put in the corridors of St James' Hospital in Leeds after patients complained about a lack of flowers by their bedsides.

Blooms have been banned by 92 per cent of UK hospitals amid fears they cause infection and spread bacteria.

The machine is currently distributing silk flower posies for free in the run-up to Mother's Day.

Statistics show 76 per cent of people disagree with the ban and many experts believe they have a beneficial effect on patients' wellbeing.

Studies show nine out of ten people 
believe that receiving flowers can dramatically improve someone's mood 
and 50 per cent of the public feel flowers can aid a person's recovery.

Kay Lawton, Deputy Facilities Manager at St James's Hospital, said: 'Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust has a ban on fresh flowers across many of our wards and though we have good reason to do so, we are really excited about this campaign.

'We believe that silk flowers are a truly brilliant way to provide the holistic benefits that flowers can give to our patients whilst combating some of the health and safety issues that are brought about through visitors bringing their family and friends fresh flowers.'

St James' Hospital in Leeds has come up with a unique way of getting around the flower ban, which is in place in 92 per cent of UK hospitals

Patient Pearline Berry said: 'These flowers are beautiful, I will treasure them.

'My stay at St James's has been brilliant - the staff have treated me so well and these flowers have just completed my great experience here.

'Flowers really make me feel happy.'

Though it's currently each individual NHS trust's decision, many hospitals are increasingly banning fresh flowers for a variety of reasons.

Catherine Vowles was one of the first people on the elderly ward at St James' hospital to receive the flowers

The flower machine was not only installed to get around the ban, but also because many believe flowers have therapeutic effects on the sick

Some trusts fear flowers can trigger allergies, some flower water can contain harmful bacteria and that fresh flowers are creating further work for nurses.

Psychologist Emma Kenny, who is supporting the 'Power of the Flower' campaign, a campaign to get flowers back in hospital wards to benefit the health of patients, said: 'There are many studies that show the psychological impact that flowers can have on a person's recovery or general well-being.

'In a hospital environment it is vital that patients are kept feeling as upbeat and positive as possible.'

Country Baskets flower company installed the machine for free, as a charitable donation, and has been instrumental in handing out the free flowers all weekend.
