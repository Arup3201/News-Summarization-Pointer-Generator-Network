Hoek comes to Manchester with a fantastic reputation with some of the game's best goalkeepers - having helped developed the skills of Red Devils legend Edwin van der Sar at Ajax as well as Spain international duo Victor Valdes and Pepe Reina during his time at Barcelona.

Speaking to ManUtd.com the Denmark international stopper expressed his sadness at losing former coach Chris Woods but added that he is relishing the opportunity to learn from van Gaal and Hoek.

Asked if he is excited to work with van Gaal and Hoek, the 30-year-old said: 'Yeah, very much so, both Mr van Gaal and Frans Hoek the goalkeeping coach. I have heard a lot of good things and I am really excited to start working with both of them.

'You benefit from having a period of time with every goalkeeping coach and it was quite a short period that we had with Chris Woods.

'We really enjoyed that time with him, or at least I did.

'But just looking at Frans Hoekâ€™s results - and what he has done for different goalkeepers throughout his career - speaks for itself. Everyone would be excited about working with him and I am definitely excited to get started.'
