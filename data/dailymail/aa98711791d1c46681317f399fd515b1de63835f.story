It's the type of fairy-tale castle that wouldn't look out of place in a Disney film.

But this isn't the work of fiction – five-star Château Gütsch sits majestically on top of a 1,600ft hill, overlooking the postcard-pretty city of Lucerne in Switzerland.

Our car winds its way up to the 50,000sqft towering structure, which has stood on the site since 1888, built by architect Emil Vogt as a private residence with connecting hotel and restaurant.

No it isn't Disneyland but the Château Gütsch in Lucerne in Switzerland certainly is a fairy-tale 

His Belle-Epoque-style residence was inspired by the Bavarian castle Neuschwanstein, and as such attracted the attention of the great and the good, with the likes of Charlie Chaplin, Sophia Loren and Alfred Hitchcock staying after Queen Victoria wrote favourably about her holiday in Lucerne.

The white-washed boutique hotel opened its doors in 2014 after being complete refurbished and redecorated by Martyn Lawrence Bullard – breathing new life to the residence.

Once at the top, guests are afforded stunning views over the Vierwaldstätter Lake and mountains that surround it. And for those wandering around Lucerne, Château Gütsch's Hollywood-style sign is always within sight.

The Gütsch Bar boasts modern decor at its finest and is the perfect setting for a pre-dinner tipple

For £820-a-night guests can stay in the Queen Victoria suite, boasting a four-poster bed, 19th-century Swiss paintings, and a claw-footed bath 

Inside, none of the 27 rooms and suites is the same; with some boasting cosy window bays, while others have beamed ceilings or Victorian plasterwork with Bullard sticking to traditional Swiss colours and patterns combined with modern luxury.

Beautiful upholstered canopy beds alternate with antique four-poster beds and French Louis XVI carved sleigh beds, dressed in fine linens and accessories.

We get into the quaint old-fashioned lift - which can only carry three people at a time - and take a rickety to the third floor.

Our cosy double room is decorated like a work of art – blue and white wallpaper dominates the colour-themed carpeted space, which features an incredibly comfortable double bed and large windows with stunning views across the lake. It's worth getting up early just to see the sun rise.

There's also a pretty chair and small table in the corner next to another window looking out across the picturesque city. The elegant bathroom features a double sink and a bath – and another window which when opened offers an incredible vista as you shower.

For the more modest guest rooms are decorated in fresh blue and white with views across the lake 

For those with cash to spare, a stay can be booked in the up to £820-a-night Queen Victoria suite, boasting a four-poster bed, 19th-century Swiss paintings, and a claw-footed bath tub in the middle of the room.

And there is the Alexander suite with its enormous wrap-around 935ft² private terrace along with a marble-clad bath under the castle's grand turret offering unparalleled views of the city.

Most of the rooms offer spectacular views of Lucerne, the lake and the mountains or have generous balconies and living areas.

The downstairs of Château Gütsch is just as impressive as what we find upstairs.

The sophisticated Gütsch Bar boasts modern decor at its finest – the perfect place to sip a pre-dinner G&T surrounded by Ikat painted walls, imperial green velvets, and Prussian blue leather, all reflected under a gold leaf ceiling.

The Rittersaal (Knight's Hall) has undergone a dramatic transformation, boasting huge mirrors and works of art on the walls, as well as spectacular chandeliers, large draped windows and a royal blue theme with chairs and chic sofas throughout.

On the floor below, through a stone-lined corridor adorned with historic artefacts is Restaurant Château Gütsch, which, surrounded by huge windows, offers indoor and terrace dining while enjoying spectacular panorama of the city, mountain and lake.

As well as breakfast – perfect poached eggs! – we dine here in the evening, with the ceiling draped in chandeliers and tables covered by crisp white tablecloths; a full-on, three-hour culinary experience.

The well-thought-out menus change daily, and there is even a full vegetarian menu, boasting traditional as well as innovative dishes.

My husband and I opt for the tasting menus – six courses of wondrous delights (£100), accompanied by delicious wines and too-drinkable Prosecco.

Dishes on offer include Burrata mousse with tomato chutney and quinoa-olive salad; falafel with a poached free-range egg, eggplant caviar and herb pesto; and mushroom risotto with parmesan crackers and baby leeks.

Carol flew with Swiss Air to Zurich. Stay at Château Gütsch from 330 CHF (£216) per room per night including breakfast, Wi-Fi, service, VAT and outdoor parking. Excluding city tax of 3.35 CHF (£2.20) per person per night. For more information or to book contact Chateau Gütsch +41 41 289 14 14; www.chateau-guetsch.ch  

For meat-eaters, there's an abundance of choices, including beef steak tatare with egg, waffle of mushrooms and beetroot; braised ragout of deer with elderberries; and the restaurant's signature dish of Chateaubriand – served there for nearly 100 years.

Each dish is created and designed to perfection, with Executive Chef Andreas Haseloh mixing traditional ingredients with modern flavours.

The hotel also possesses its own wine cellar, where hosted wine tastings can be arranged on request.

Our excellent and friendly waitress is impressed (or shocked) that we finish everything on our plates.

We decide to walk it off the next morning, with a shuttle service provided by the hotel into Lucerne (nothing is too much trouble for the staff).

Making a day of it, we have a pass which allows us access to the city's museums, so we wander around The Swiss Museum of Transport and the Lucerne Museum of Art before heading back to the centre for mugs of steaming-hot gluhwein.

Château Gütsch can be seen from all angles, proudly watching over the city in all its majestic glory. It's a magical place; and it's easy to see why the royals and the glamorous stars fell in love with – a romantic fairy-tale castle with no Mickey Mouse in sight.
