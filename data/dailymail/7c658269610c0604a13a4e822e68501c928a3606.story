David Cameron refused to break off his holiday and recall Parliament last night despite Britain deploying warplanes to Iraq.

In a significant escalation of UK involvement in the crisis, the bombers will take on surveillance and reconnaissance duties. The Tornados are also capable of attacking enemy targets with bombs and missiles.

Ministers have already pledged to consider supplying arms to Kurdish fighters battling against Islamic State fanatics.

The developments raise the prospect of Britain joining the US in taking a more active role – all at a time when the country’s leaders are on holiday.

The Prime Minister is in Portugal where officials insist he is in close touch with ministers and officials and is still running the country. His deputy, Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg, is in Spain.

Home Secretary Theresa May is on an Alpine break, and First Secretary of State William Hague, who has been Mr Cameron’s official deputy in previous summers, is also abroad.

It leaves Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond as the most senior minister in London, even though he has only been in his job for a month. However Downing Street defied mounting calls for MPs to return to work, insisting our role was solely humanitarian.

The sense of disarray at the heart of government intensified yesterday as Foreign Office minister Mark Simmonds stepped down less than a week after the resignation of Baroness Warsi over what she described as the Government’s ‘morally indefensible’ position on Gaza.

Labour accused the Government of being ‘rudderless’ and former foreign secretary Jack Straw called for a concerted action. ‘One way or another, these maniacs, these medieval maniacs in the so-called Islamic State have got to be defeated,’ he said.

Number 10 said Mr Hammond was one of the most experienced ministers in government and had done sterling work in recent weeks. He chaired the emergency COBRA committee yesterday, which was attended by the new Defence Secretary Michael Fallon.

But Labour said the fact that three of the Foreign Office ministers had been in the office for a month or less meant the department lacked the expertise or experience to deal with simultaneous crises in Iraq, Gaza and Ukraine.

The party had to issue its statement though through junior foreign affairs spokesman John Spellar, because Labour leader Ed Miliband is also on holiday.

Mr Spellar said: ‘The new Foreign Secretary has now lost two ministers in just a few days.

‘At a time when the Foreign Office should be focused both on the crisis in Iraq and the situation in Gaza following the recent appalling violence there, David Cameron’s Government instead risks looking increasingly rudderless, and characterised by confusion.’ There were continued demands for a recall of Parliament to discuss the crisis in Iraq and for potential military action by British forces.

Departing minister Mr Simmonds told the Mail he would support further action to protect stricken communities in the north of Iraq.

‘If it is the collective international view that air strikes would be the best way to support the Kurds, then we should be supporting the Americans,’ he added.

‘We should be supporting the Americans in that way, but I’m not sure we should be putting troops on the ground.’

Mr Hammond dismissed the call, saying: ‘We don’t envisage a combat role at the present time.

‘We are talking at the moment about a humanitarian operation and using our assets to gain more awareness of what’s going on.’

Tory MPs Nick de Bois and David Burrowes have written to the Prime Minister urging the recall of Parliament to discuss the crises in Iraq and Gaza, while fellow Conservative Conor Burns said he wanted to send in special forces to assist Christians in Iraq.

Former defence minister Andrew Robathan said it was ‘no good just sending aid’ – the ‘real solution’ was to stop IS fighters.

‘There are many ways one can use military action,’ he told the BBC’s World at One. ‘Air strikes, or indeed the use of [drones], from a suitable launch site, are ways that it can be done – dare one say it – surgically without putting troops on the ground.’

Two Sentinel spy planes are also being relocated to Jordan from Oman, making them available for operations in Iraq.

Lord Dannatt, the former army chief, warned the risk of a genocide unfolding meant further help should be considered, arguing that the UK shared ‘some culpability’ for the breakdown in Iraqi society.

Number 10 indicated that Britain may be willing to follow the example of the US in arming Kurdish forces. The Prime Minister’s spokesman insisted Mr Cameron was ‘very much engaged’ with the situation despite being abroad and a recall of Parliament was ‘not on the cards’.

In a further blow to the Prime Minister, Labour has jumped to a seven-point lead over the Tory party, according to a Guardian/ICM poll. Labour support has gone up five points over the past month to 38 per cent while the Conservatives have fallen by three to 31 per cent.
