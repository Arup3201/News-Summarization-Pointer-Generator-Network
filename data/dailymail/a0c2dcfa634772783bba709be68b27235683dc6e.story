Police are investigating the ‘Fagin’ lifestyle of a jobless mother of 11 who claims she only survives thanks to a network of shoplifters.

Heather Frost, who has never worked and is reputed to claim up to £60,000 a year in benefits, was filmed buying goods from sellers at her front door, including washing powder and clothes.

‘Everybody has to get their goods off shoplifters don’t they?’ she said.

Earlier this year, it emerged the 37-year-old and her family were to be given a £500,000 eco-home paid for by the taxpayer.

Now she is causing outrage again after she appeared to praise shoplifters who supply her with cheap groceries.

Putting them away: The mother of 11 then started stacking the goods, like these air fresheners, she 'couldn't survive without'

New buys: Ms Frost appeared to have bought these clothes as part of a consignment delivered to her door

On a television documentary, Miss Frost was shown paying for the allegedly stolen household goods.

It has been suggested they were supplied by local shoplifters who sell them on at knockdown prices.

After paying a ‘seller’ for the items at her front door, she was seen in the documentary stacking her purchases in the kitchen.

She then told an interviewer: ‘I couldn’t survive without these.

‘I’d be lost without my shoplifters because they bring my washing powder. They do it at half price what the shop does.’

Miss
Frost was being featured in On Benefits And Proud, which was made in 
the wake of widespread coverage of her plans to move into a brand new 
taxpayer-funded home with her family.

But her comments have prompted a police investigation into her shopping habits at home in Churchdown, Gloucestershire.

A
spokesman for Gloucestershire Police said: ‘We are aware of the 
comments that were made on the Channel 5 programme regarding shoplifting
and the purchase of stolen goods.

'A 37-year-old woman has been officially interviewed after a caution at a police station and an investigation is ongoing.’

The documentary about families whose lives are supported by the state claimed Miss Frost receives £60,000 a year in benefits.

Screened last Monday, it featured her quest to move into a council-funded  eco-home.

She said on the show: ‘Yes, it is my choice to have a large family but there is no law to say how many kids you can have.’

Miss Frost was due to move into a specially built six-bedroom home after she complained that her existing home was not safe.

Just weeks later she was refused the new home in Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire, when it was said not to meet her needs.

The
1,850 sq ft detached property was designed with state-of-the-art 
technology to cut electricity bills – but it has now been given to 
another family.

She currently lives with her children, aged from three to 21, in two terrace houses that have been knocked together.

In
the film, the foul-mouthed 37-year-old from Gloucestershire is seen 
telling her friends that as far as angry taxpayers are concerned, her 
view is 'f*** the lot of them.'

'It's a f***ing s****y council house,' she adds.
'Everyone wants to believe what they read in the f***ing papers don't 
they.

'Every child needs a house, a roof over their head I should say, 
don't they? It 
wasn't our choice for the council to build a new house, it was theirs. 

'No one's put a gun to their f***ing head. I think they [other people] 
are jealous. F*** the lot of them! Everyone's entitled to their opinion 
but everyone's entitled to a place to live.'

Frost,
who receives the equivalent of £60,000 a year, is now looking forward 
to a council-funded renovation of her current home, which will see the 
two three-bedroom houses she currently occupies knocked together to 
create a permanent six-bedroom house.

The cost of the renovation will run into thousands of pounds, and includes a new kitchen and bedrooms.

But,
despite the vast expense to taxpayers, who spend a staggering £100 
million on benefits every day according to Government figures, Frost, 
who has never had a full time job, says the system is put there to help 
people like her.

'Yes, people don't agree with the 
benefits system and s*** like that but the benefits system is put there 
to help people that can't go out and work,' she asserts.

'Yes, it's my choice and my 
decision to have a large family but there's no law out there to say how 
many kids you can have or can't have. There's people out there with more
kids than me, that's my argument.'

She adds: 'Fred
West or someone who murdered someone wouldn't have got as much s*** in 
the press as what I got.  

'You only get what you're entitled to. We
have to budget. You know, a weekly shop costs quite a bit, then gas and
electric for both houses - it's all got to come out of it.

'By the end 
of the week, you can guarantee you're skint. We can't afford to take the
kids to Spain or on posh holidays.'

Frost says she is looking forward to 
seeing what kind of response those who do eventually get the £500,000 
home she almost moved into.

'Are the people who get it going to get as 
much grief as what I got?' she asks. 'The £500,000 house was built for somebody. So lets
see if they get the s*** I got for being allocated it.'

Miss
Frost, who is sterile after suffering from cervical cancer in 2011, 
first became pregnant when she was 15 to a 23-year-old boyfriend who 
ended up in prison.
