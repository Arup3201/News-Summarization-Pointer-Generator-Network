Authorities are searching for a gunman after a meteorologist for a Texas TV station was shot multiple times while leaving the studio this morning.

Patrick Crawford, the morning weatherman for KCEN in Bruceville-Eddy near Waco, had climbed into his car around 9.15am on Wednesday when the man approached and they exchanged words.

The suspect, a man in his 30s, pulled out a semi-automatic handgun and shot Crawford repeatedly in the body and arm as he sat in his car, DPS Trooper D.L. Wilson said.

Crawford managed to back up at high speed and drive out of the parking lot. He crossed the interstate and drove to a group of construction workers, who administered first aid and called 911.

Crawford, who grew up in Plano, Texas and earned his meteorology degree from Northern Illinois University, moved from New Orleans and joined the station in September 2012

'He was entering the car when the exchange of gunfire, or the gunfire started,' Senior Trooper DL Wilson with Highway Patrol told KHOU. 'He did an excellent job getting in the car speeding off and probably saved his life.'

He was taken to Scott and White Memorial Hospital in Temple and underwent surgery.

Crawford's friends told KCEN that he is doing well and that doctors said he is 'very lucky'.

As he drove off, the suspect fled on foot.

'He is considered armed and dangerous at this time,' Wilson said. 'We're still going with a white male, 30 to 35, receding hairline, had a black hoodie and dark-colored pants.' 

Police have launched a massive search for the suspect, who was described as a white male aged between 30 and 35. He was dressed in dark clothing and has a receding hairline.

On Wednesday afternoon, authorities said they had a person of interest in custody, but KXXV later reported that it was not the gunman. Instead, the man in custody, who does not speak English, had been seen running from the area because he had warrants out for his arrest.

Speaking on Wednesday afternoon, Trooper Wilson said Crawford had not recognized his attacker. Authorities have still not said if the shooting was random.  

Station officials had no comment early Wednesday afternoon but may release one later in the day.

Crawford, who grew up in Plano, Texas and earned his meteorology degree from Northern Illinois University, moved from New Orleans and joined the station in September 2012.

He is married to fellow meteorologist and KCEN producer Heather Brinkmann.

This morning, he showed off his winning Christmas sweater for the station's 'Ugly Sweater Contest' and shared images online of him raising a trophy just hours before he was shot. 

The town is about 75 miles north of Austin. 

Recovering: Crawford, who has been with the station for two years, managed to drive away and when his car crashed, construction workers ran to his aid. He was taken to hospital and underwent surgery
