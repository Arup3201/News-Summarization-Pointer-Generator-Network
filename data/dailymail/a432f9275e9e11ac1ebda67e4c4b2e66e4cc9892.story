'Chaos': Police said the house resembled a 'World War I battlefield' after the boozy party (file photo)

German lawmakers are stepping up their attempts to make Facebook pay for police and medical services after a weekend 'horror party' advertised on the social networking site saw an attempted murder, a man fall into a bonfire and a schoolboy needing treatment for alcoholic poisoning.

The party took place in Lengdorf in 
Bavaria after being posted on the Facebook site. Over 200 people 
converged on the house of the host - who organised the event while his 
parents were away - and chaos quickly ensued.An
18-year-old youth was taken into custody after assaulting another 
guest, 19, in the street outside with a lethal butterfly knife. Then an 
ambulance had to be called to help a severely burned man who fell into 
the bonfire in the back garden, sustaining injuries to his arms and 
hands.

As well as various fights, broken 
glass and smashed furniture, an ambulance had to race another guest to 
hospital with severe alcohol poisoning after downing a bottle of vodka.

'It
looked like a WWI battlefield rather than a house,' said a police 
spokesman. 'The house was wrecked, just a giant mountain of rubbish.'

The
boy who threw the party had expected 20 guests to turn up. But as is so
often the case with events posted on Facebook, strangers descended in 
their dozens.

Hundreds of miles away in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern near the Baltic Sea, a major police alert was triggered after a man posted on Facebook that he wanted to murder the new boyfriend of his ex-girlfriend before taking his own life. He uploaded a photo of himself on to the site with a firearm to make his point.

Police in Boizenburg moved in to arrest him and he barricaded himself into his apartment and pointed his rifle out the window at police. He threatened to blow up his apartment building if they did not leave but gave himself up after a tense one-hour standoff on Saturday night.

Police said later he was found to be under the influence of drugs. 'He was psychotic,' said a police spokesman.

The incidents have reinforced calls from politicians for Facebook to be accountable for the costs of such police and medical operations in the wake of postings on the site.

In August police were forced to halt passenger trains after a party organised on Facebook turned into a riot.

As roadblocks turned away more and more guests heading to the rave-up at Freiburg in southern Germany they spilled on to nearby railway tracks.

Police had to halt trains as they cleared the lines - and pledged someone would pay.

'We have enough work to do as it without having to act as servants for some dumb social network,' said an angry police spokesman after officers endured abuse, dodged flying bottles and stopped fighting among the 400 guests who turned up to the party organised by twin sisters at their home while their parents were on holiday.

Gatecrashers: Details of the party in Bavaria were posted on Facebook

Rail traffic to and from Freiburg - a major hub on the way to Switzerland - was delayed for 25 minutes as a result of the party.Reinhold Gall, interior minister of the southern German state of Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg - where Freiburg lies - is supporting a cross-party initiative to get legislation passed in Berlin for Facebook to cough up.He said: 'A commercial internet platform that makes something like this possible also carries a large measure of responsibility. Somebody must pay for this.'

Rainer Wendt, chairman of the German Police Union, said: 'If you invite people to a Facebook party that sparks a police intervention, you will have to pay the costs. But politicians should create the legal basis for making Facebook share the costs.'The firm has made the platform available, and can't pretend it has nothing to do with it.'

Student Jay Whiston died after being stabbed in the chest at a house party in Colchester, Essex, at the weekend.

Around 200 people had descended on the party after word of the event spread on Facebook and Twitter.

The 17-year-old was knifed as he tried to stop troublemakers stealing his friend's phone.
