Parents who had a baby in 2012 can expect to shell out $241,080 by the time the kid reaches 18 years old, a number that has been going steadily up for years as average wages have gone down.

A U.S. Department of Agriculture report released Wednesday looked at food, shelter, and other necessities, which rose 3 percent from 2011 numbers.

The biggest expense increases were seen in costs related to child care, education, health care, and clothing. College tuition, however, was not included in those totals.

Children, by the numbers: The USDA annually estimates the costs of raising a child born for a given year. Over his or her lifetime, a baby born in 2012 will cost parents an average of $241,080

Child care, for instance, has increased twice as fast as the median income of families with children since 2000, reports KPTV.

In a trend worrisome to many, median income has gone down by $4,000 in America since that same year.

‘Many families are priced out of licensed child care services,’ Lynette Fraga, executive director of Child Care Aware of America told KPTV. ‘If they are priced out, then the health and safety of those children are at risk.’

The annual report is based on data from the Federal government's Consumer Expenditure Survey, which tracks household expenditures.

Variables: The number is for median income families with only one child. The number varies depending on geographic location, income, number of children and other factors

For the year 2012, annual child-rearing expenses per child for a middle-income, two-parent family ranged from $12,600 to $14,700, depending on the age of the child.

In addition to age, something else that factored into the cost of child rearing was location.

The report notes that geographic variations affect the cost of raising a child.

Raising a child costs the most in the urban Northeast, according to the study, followed by the urban West and urban Midwest.

The lowest expenses were found in the urban South and other rural areas.

‘Lower housing costs contributed to the reduced expenditures for families in rural areas,’ explained study author and economist Mark Lino, Ph.D. ‘Families in rural areas also saw lower child-care and education expenses.’

Add it up: The USDA created a calculator that allows parents to input their location, children's ages, and other factors to estimate their child rearing costs

The USDA created a calculator that families can use to estimate the costs of raising their children, one that allows them to indicate number of children, locale, income level, and other variables.

Though intimidating, especially in the light of falling wages, the numbers aren’t startling to those who track such costs.

According to the FDA, the 2.6 percent increase from 2011 to 2012 lower than the average annual increase of 4.4 percent since 1960.

In 1960, a middle-income family were projected to spend $25,230—that’s $195,690 in 2012 dollars—to raise a child.
