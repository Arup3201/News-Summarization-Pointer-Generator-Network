Asking prices for houses have dropped steeply this August as the property market has its 'summer sale'.

Lower demand caused by the holiday season has seen the price tag for an average British property fall this month by 2.9 per cent to £262,401.

The dip was particularly noticeable in London, where the average asking price was 5.9 per cent lower at £552,783 than in July.

Property website Rightmove said it was the largest drop in asking prices for the month of August in more than a decade.

Company director Miles Shipside said the figures reflect sellers adopting a 'summer sales attitude to pricing', in the knowledge that potential buyers tend to be thinner on the ground during the holiday season, before activity lifts again in the autumn.

Despite the drop, asking prices in the capital are still 10.3 per cent higher than they were a year ago. The North was the only region to see asking prices increase month-on-month, with a 0.5 per cent uplift pushing them to £149,354 typically.

In Wales, prices edged down by 2.0 per cent month-on-month to reach £173,176 on average.

Alongside these seasonal factors, Rightmove also said that recent speculation about the prospect of interest rates rising, more properties coming up for sale and toughened mortgage lending rules are likely to be having an impact on the market.

At the end of April, new rules came into force under the Mortgage Market Review (MMR) which mean lenders have to ask mortgage applicants more detailed questions to check whether they can afford their home loan.

Mr Shipside said: 'New seller asking prices are good lead indicators of the current mood of the market, and those who have put their property up for sale in the last month are obviously aware that potential buyers are thinner on the ground at this time of year and need to be tempted to act by cheaper prices.

'A drop in August is typical but it's steeper than expected this year for two reasons. Firstly, both buyers and sellers are becoming increasingly aware about personal finances, given that the cost of mortgages are going up and regulators are trying to bring availability down.

'This limits what buyers are willing or able to pay, and helps moderate sellers' price expectations.

'The second factor is the turnaround in London. Having forced national average prices up for the last two years, it's now pushing them down with three falls in a row, and a real biggie this month.

'Holidays always cause a big price reverse in the capital, but there is also a massive year-on-year jump in the number of newly-marketed properties, up 20 per cent compared to August last year, and double the figure seen in any other region. More sellers and fewer buyers mean price falls.'

London-based estate agent Simon Gerrard, who is president of the National Association of Estate Agents, said: 'Comments from the Bank of England mean that potential buyers are concerned about the rise in interest rates and don't want to find themselves in a position where they are hamstrung by rates going up.'

He said the MMR rules also mean mortgage applications are taking longer to process.

Mr Gerrard said: 'In London where prices are much higher than the national average anyway, we are beginning to see the impact of these factors.'
