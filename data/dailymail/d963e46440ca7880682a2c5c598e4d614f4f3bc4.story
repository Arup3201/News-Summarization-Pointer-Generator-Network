A Texas jury sentenced Ana Trujillo Friday to life in prison for fatally stabbing her boyfriend with the five-and-a-half-inch stiletto heel of her shoe, striking him at least 25 times in the face and head.

Trujillo was convicted of murder Tuesday by the same jury for killing 59-year-old Alf Stefan Andersson during an argument last June at his Houston condominium.

Defense attorneys argued that Trujillo, 45, was defending herself from an attack by Andersson, who was a University of Houston professor and researcher.

Trujillo could be seen silently weeping when her sentence was handed down.

‘I never meant to hurt him,’ Trujillo said before the judge made the jury's decision final. ‘It was never my intent. I loved him. I wanted to get away. I never wanted to kill him.’

Andersson's niece, lva Olofsson, said the family was pleased with the outcome of the trial.

‘My uncle was a great man. He was kind. He didn't deserve what happened to him. We are happy that justice is served,’ she said.

During closing arguments in the trial's punishment phase, prosecutor John Jordan asked jurors for the maximum sentence: life in prison.

Jordan said Trujillo not only violently killed Andersson but tried to ruin his character during the trial by falsely claiming he had abused her.

‘Send the message that in our community, when you beat a man to death for no reason, when you come into a courtroom and you slaughter his good name ... that we in Texas are going to hold you accountable,’ Jordan said.

Trujillo's attorney, Jack Carroll, asked jurors to find that his client acted in the heat of sudden passion, which would limit her sentence to between two and 20 years. Carroll asked jurors to give her a two-year sentence.

‘Ms. Trujillo needs mercy right now,’ he said. During Carroll's closing argument, Trujillo began sobbing.

She later stated: 'I respect their [jurors'] decision, but it was self-defense. I loved him and never wanted to kill him.'

During
 their deliberations Friday, jurors asked to look at several pieces of 
evidence, including the blue suede stiletto heel — a size 9 platform 
pump.

They reached 
agreement on a sentence after more than four hours of deliberations, and
 also found that the crime was not done in the heat of sudden passion.

Prosecutors
 argued Friday that Trujillo didn't kill Andersson in a moment of sudden
 passion but that his slaying was a vicious murder in which she pinned 
him down and repeatedly stabbed him with her shoe while he never fought 
back.

Trujillo, 45, took the witness stand in Houston for the first time Thursday during the two-week trial as part of the punishment phase.

Trujillo's attorneys said Andersson attacked her and she defended herself with the only weapon she had available, her shoe.

During
 more than five hours of rambling testimony by mid-afternoon Thursday, Trujillo 
said that she had been repeatedly abused by men, including sexual 
assault by her first husband.

Trujillo told jurors Andersson became enraged and she fought for her life during a fight that lasted more than an hour.

She said she tried to calm him down, but Andersson started yelling at her and Trujillo realized she could not talk him down.

‘I
 became frightened. I did fear for my life. I felt he lost it,’ she 
said, adding that she started striking him with the shoe anywhere she 
could.

‘Why did you keep on hitting him?’ her attorney Jack Carroll asked.

‘He wouldn't let go of my leg. The pain wouldn't stop,’ she said.

Trujillo said that at first she hit him on his back and on his arms, then on his head as a last resort.

‘I had no idea I was hurting him that 
badly,’ she said. ‘I reached over and said, “Oh God, what happened?” I 
reached over and my hands were full of blood.’

She
 also told jurors that Andersson, a native of Sweden, was a heavy drinker who refused to eat 
and whose mental and physical health began to deteriorate.

She said she became afraid of him because at night he would wake up angry, disoriented and start yelling.

When
 asked by her lawyer, Mr Carroll, why she didn't leave Andersson, 
Trujillo said: 'Because I loved him and I wanted him to get better. I 
wanted him to stop drinking so much.'

But during the testimony, Trujillo did not discuss Andersson in great detail.

During often meandering testimony, 
Trujillo told jurors she had a history of being sexually or physically 
abused by men. She said she had been sexually assaulted by her first 
husband and told jurors that another boyfriend had kicked her in the 
stomach when she was pregnant, resulting in a miscarriage.

Trujillo was found guilty this week of killing Alf Stefan Andersson with her stiletto shoe

Trujillo described being attacked in an incident reminiscent of Andersson's slaying. She told jurors a friend in 2009 had tried to rape her in his apartment, pinning her down and that she used the only weapon within reach - a candlestick - to fend him off.

Trujillo's former friend testified Wednesday that it was Trujillo who knocked him out with the candlestick in an unprovoked attack. No charges were filed related to that incident.

She also discussed her upbringing, including growing up in Arizona after being born in Mexico, and her various jobs, including massage therapist, club bouncer and artist.

Witnesses presented by prosecutors in the punishment phase
detailed Trujillo's criminal history or firsthand experiences in which she
became violent toward them when she drank. Trujillo was arrested twice for
drunk driving. She had been drinking the night of Andersson's death but her
blood alcohol level was not tested, according to testimony.

A psychologist testifying for the 
defense told jurors Trujillo had been in a series of violent or abusive 
relationships, including with Andersson, and she was acting in 
self-defense on the night of the slaying.

Jurors on Wednesday also heard from Anderson's family and friends, who testified that he was a good person who wouldn't hesitate to help anyone and that they were still trying to understand his violent death.
