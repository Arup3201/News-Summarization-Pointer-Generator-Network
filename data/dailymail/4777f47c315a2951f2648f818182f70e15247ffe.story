Tory MP Philip Davies, pictured, received a subscription and an £870 trip from companies with links to the betting trade

A Tory MP did not refer to subscriptions and benefits from companies with links to the betting trade during a recent investigation into the betting industry.

Philip Davies, a member of the culture, media and sport select committee, declared the donations on his Register of Members' Financial Interests but did not refer to them during a year-long investigation into the betting industry - saying in one case that he should have mentioned it but did not due to an inadvertent oversight and in the other case that he did not have to as the other the firm was not directly linked to bookmakers.

Mr Davies, who worked in a bookmakers in his late teens, championed the industry viewpoint during the year-long investigation.

Last March, the 40-year-old was taken to the Cheltenham festival, a trip worth £870, by Ladbrokes, according to The Guardian.

But when he questioned Ladbrokes chief executive Richard Glynn at a select committee session six months later, he did not mention it.

The influential committee member has reportedly been given an annual 'subscription' worth £4,680 from Peninsula Business Services, run by a founder of BetFred.

Peter Done founded the company with his brother and the bookmakers has 1,000 shops in Britain.

Mr Done is currently a shareholder in BetFred's holding company.

Mr Davies insisted he had received no personal benefit from the subscription, and had listed it on his Register of Members' Financial Interest. He said the company offered £9,000-worth of subscriptions for a service that relates to employment tribunals and that he was not aware of any connection with Peter Done. He would only declare it in parliament if he was talking about matters relating to employment tribunals.

Mr Davies said: 'I did not think I had interests to declare' in relation to his decision not to refer to this during the inquiry.

The parliamentary code of conduct states that where members have a financial interest 'directly affected by a particular inquiry' or a 'personal interest 
[that] may reflect upon the work of the committee' then the MP should 
consider stepping aside from proceedings.

If MPs decide not to, the code
says 'a member should make a declaration of interest at an early stage 
in any inquiry to which that interest particularly relates.

'If the 
interest is especially relevant to one witness or group of witnesses 
appearing before the committee, the interest should be declared again at
the appropriate session of evidence.'

When Mr Davies was asked about his subscription from Peninsula, he said the link to a bookmakers was 'just a coincidence'.

It came after 'a constituent got in contact asking for advice on vexatious claims from employees'.

During a year-long investigation into the betting industry, Mr Davies supported the trade and visited, along with other committee members, casino resorts in Australia and Macao.

Last July, MPs called on the Government to relax rules restricting gambling venues and machines.

The culture, media and sport select committee said councils should be able to allow more gambling machines in betting shops and casinos.

The MPs also said the Gambling Commission should charge operators lower fees.

When campaigners said changing the rules would lead to problem gambling, Mr Davies called the viewpoint nonsensical in the Commons.

A decision with regards to the number of gambling machines is due to be reached in January by ministers.

An earlier version of this article suggested that Mr Davies had not declared the subscription or the trip in his Register of Members' Financial Interests. We are happy to clarify that, while they were not referred to during the inquiry, they were declared on the Register.
