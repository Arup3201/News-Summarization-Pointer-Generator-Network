Australian frigate HMAS Darwin has struck again, this time relieving drug smugglers of more than six tonnes of hash in a high seas bust off the coast of Africa.

The operation follows a succession of major seizures of hashish and heroin and other drugs, now totalling more than 12 tonnes, since Darwin deployed to the Middle East in March.

In the latest bust, Darwin's boarding parties located 315 bags, each containing around 20 kilograms of hashish, hidden aboard a smuggling dhow intercepted in international waters in the Indian Ocean.

The total haul came to 6248 kilograms, with an estimated street value of some $250 million.

Darwin commanding officer Commander Terry Morrison said the removal of this quantity of narcotics would have a significant impact on the funding of terrorist organisations.

Darwin is operating a part of Combined Task Force 150 whose commander, Royal Navy Commodore Jeremy Blunden said this was another outstanding result.

"My congratulations to Commander Morrison and his very fine ship's company who have set new standards for professionalism and teamwork in counter narcotics activity in the Indian Ocean," he said in a statement.

Hauls of seized drugs are dumped overboard and the crews of smuggling vessels sent on their way.
