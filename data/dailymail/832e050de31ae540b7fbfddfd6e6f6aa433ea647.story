A 13-month-old boy trapped his finger in a metal mop bucket after his mother left him unattended ‘for a split second’.

Alfie Doidge had been playing in the kitchen of his parents’ home, in Oswestry, Shropshire, when the incident occurred.

A crew of seven firefighters eventually cut the toddler's finger free using a hacksaw.

Stuck: Alfie Doidge's finger swelled up after he trapped it in a metal mop bucket. He was freed with a hacksaw

Alfie's mother, Lisa, 41, said: 'He's not usually allowed in there.

'I left the room for a split second to grab my phone and found him bending down by the mop bucket when I came back in.'

It was only when she heard Alfie's cries that she realised what had happened and shouted to Alfie's father Carl, 26, for help.

He said: 'We tried washing-up liquid, but his finger was swollen, so our first thought was to ring the fire brigade.'

A team of seven firefighters cut free 13-month-old Alfie, after he was momentarily left unattended by mother Lisa, 41 (pictured right, with father Carl, 26)

Within minutes a crew of seven from 
Baschurch fire station, along with a paramedic, arrived with hydraulic 
cutting equipment to release Alfie from the bucket.

But fearing the machinery could twist 
the metal and sever the Alfie's finger, firefighters decided to use a 
hacksaw to cut the bucket away.

Mr
Doidge said: 'Alfie was screaming. He was hysterical when they got to 
the last bit, but the fire officer said he would put his hand in the way
to protect him because he could see Alfie was getting really scared.

'We are so grateful to the fire crew and the paramedic,' he added.
