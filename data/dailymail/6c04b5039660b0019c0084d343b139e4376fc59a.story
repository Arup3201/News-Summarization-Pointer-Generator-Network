From Chinese characters that mean nothing to misspelt Hindi proverbs, getting a tattoo in a foreign language can leave you with more than you bargained for.

But for 19-year-old cleaner Millie, getting a tattoo in English came with problems of its own after her tattooist managed to spell 'female' wrong - and did it despite having the correct spelling in front of him.

Millie's tattoo, which was inspired 
by an inking belonging to former X-Factor judge Tulisa Contostavlos, 
should have read: 'The Female Boss'. But thanks to her inept tattooist, Millie was left with one that said 'The Feamale Boss' instead.

Oh dear: 19-year-old Millie's tattoo should have read 'The Female Boss'. Instead 'female' came with an extra 'a'

'I was mortified,' says Millie of her embarrassing tattoo. 'When I was having it 
done, I looked away because I was in so much pain.

'He told me he was 
dyslexic and I spelled it right for him but he still spelt it wrong on my 
arm!'

Now the teenager, who will appear on tonight's episode of TLC documentary Extreme Beauty Disasters has been forced to seek professional help to get rid of her embarrassing etching.

Speaking to TLC skin expert and dermatologist Dr Sam Bunting, Millie reveals she had doubts about the tattoo from the start.

'My friend said to me, "are you sure female has an 'a' in it?'," she explains of the day she got the inking 'and I said yes, because it has. I thought she meant second "a" but she didn't.'

Original: Millie was inspired by N-Dubz singer Tulisa Contostavlos' correctly spelt The Female Boss artwork

Not happy: Millie says she was left mortified by the tattoo and in need of drastic treatment to get rid of it

Improvement: Millie was forced to conceal the offending etching with an inking of a quill

Embarrassed, Millie tried to blame the problem on the N-Dubz singer, telling her horrified mother Tracey that her tattoo was spelled the same way as Tulisa's.

But eventually, she revealed the truth - much to her mother's amusement. 'My mum was a bit gobsmacked at first but
 then she thought it was funny because things like that just happen to 
me,' says Millie.

'Basically, it's my own fault, isn't it. But I don't want it to stay 
on my arm forever.'

Given a choice between having the tattoo removed with lasers or concealing it with another, Millie is plumps for the latter after being told that removal means giving up her beloved sunbed sessions.

'Ultimately, the new tattoo looks much better and the spelling mistake is history,' sighs Dr Bunting, who had tried to persuade the teen to opt for laser treatment. 'If she's happy, then I'm happy.'

And what does Millie think of her new quill shaped tattoo? 'I think he's done a pretty good job!' she chirps.

Will she be getting another etching? Despite her experience, the teen admits she plans to - much to the consternation of her mother, Tracey.

This time around though, an inking involving letters seems unlikely.
