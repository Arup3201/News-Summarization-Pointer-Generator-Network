It was the match Martin O’Neill needed to win to convince the many doubters that this qualifying campaign is not destined to end in failure.

For regardless of substitute Shane Long’s stoppage-time equaliser amid a frenzied finish, it was a performance and result which again raises more questions than answers.

O’Neill will protest that the second-half display was better – it could not have been worse than their sorry first-half showing – but this was supposed to be the making of Ireland at the Aviva Stadium, a venue which is yet to produce any iconic nights for the boys in green.

But therein lay part of the problem, for those in green were outnumbered by the partisan Poles, who celebrated Slawomir Peszko’s first-half opener by firing scores of fluorescent red flares.

Thanks to Long’s late intervention, however, Ireland’s hopes of automatic qualification have not gone up in smoke, for now at least.

But scrutiny of O’Neill and Roy Keane’s expensive tenure will intensify. They trail table toppers Poland by three points with world champions Germany and Scotland two ahead.

It is, you feel, now a shoot-out between Ireland and the Scots – who meet here in June – for the third-placed play-off berth.

‘Scotland now is very, very important. I think we will have to beat them. If the second-half showing is anything to go by then I think we’re capable of doing that,’ said O’Neill.

‘This might just prove an important point. We are still in the competition.’

O’Neill admitted before the game that defeat would have ended their hopes of finishing in the top two places.

Long’s last-gasp effort at least spared the manager that trauma, but his celebration of a ‘terrific’ second half which perhaps deserved more was misplaced.

‘We started off tentatively. We were a little bit nervous. We conceded a poor goal and that put us on the back foot,’ he reflected.

‘But our second-half performance was terrific. We deserved at least a draw and we could easily have won it. We bossed it.

‘We got the momentum going and the crowd stayed with us. So overall I’m pleased.

‘Whatever we may lack, courage and spirit are not among them. It’s no fluke we’ve scored late goals in three games.’

O’Neill had named an attacking line-up – at least in terms of personnel – but a 4-4-1-1 system did little to inspire an early offensive zeal.

His decision to play winger Robbie Brady at left back was already looking like an error of judgment before the mistake which led to Poland’s breakthrough on 26 minutes.

Surrendering possession on the fringe of his area, Brady could only watch in horror as Maciej Rybus and Peszko combined with the latter smashing beyond Shay Given.

O’Neill’s response to an uninspiring half was to switch to 4-4-2 with Jonathan Walters – wasted on the right-hand side of midfield – moved forward to partner captain Robbie Keane.

They would have been level but for the width of a post when Brady’s deflected centre spiralled above and beyond a panicked Lukasz Fabianski and cracked the woodwork on 52 minutes.

But it was the introduction of substitute James McClean which sparked the revival. He burst down the left within moments of his arrival and landed a cross on the head of Keane whose cushioned nod bounced back off the post.

McClean was again the provider for Seamus Coleman but the right back lashed woefully wide from 14 yards as the hosts poured forward in search of parity.

And they had to wait until the second minute of injury-time for Long to pounce with a close-range poke when the ball dropped at his feet from Brady’s corner.

The goal may have stolen a point, but O’Neill and his team still have a point to prove.
