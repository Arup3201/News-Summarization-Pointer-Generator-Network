Tens of thousands of 
people treated to horrible train and bus rides into MetLife Stadium 
were forced to make that same journey out of the Super Bowl - only this time it was somehow worse.

Massive
 crowds appeared bottle-necked as they waited for New Jersey Transit 
trains to arrive at platforms. The wait was so long officials pleaded with fans to stay in the stadium and opened the
 tony Chase Club for people to take refuge.

The nearly 
28,000 people who took mass transit to the game were stuck on lines 
brought to a standstill by temporarily installed airport-style security 
machines that failed to keep up with the volume of passengers taking 
transit to the Super Bowl as authorities had instructed.

The
 previous record train ridership to the Meadowlands had been 22,000 for a
 2009 U2 concert, authorities said. Sunday's ridership doubled 
officials' estimates.

Buses were the better option: Fans who rode buses into the game were whisked out of New Jersey and back to Manhattan within minutes

Despite record ridership 
causing massive inbound delays prior to the game, NJ Transit officials 
had only one train platform open when the game let out.

A
 second platform was eventually opened, but the damage had been done - 
50 additional buses had to be brought in to move people out of the 
parking lot, and it took more than two hours to get them to the port 
Authority Bus Terminal on the edge of Manhattan's Times Square.

Stadium
 officials reopened the Chase Club inside, normally reserved only for 
VIP ticket holders, but were still charging full price for food and 
drinks, according to the Star Ledger.

A
 New Jersey Transit official said that 25,000 people had been moved only
 to Secaucus Junction by midnight, two hours after confetti started 
raining down on the field, and called the operation a 'tremendous 
success.'

It is not known how long it took to clear the transit hub of passengers

'This is a joke,' said Seattle native Jeff Chapman, an engineer. 'We're not even from here and we could've told you this would've happened.'

'What do you expect when you don't give people any other option to get home,' added friend Willie Whitmore, a project manager. 'It's ridiculous.'

Scoreboard announcements inside the stadium begged people to stay inside the gates to ease congestion and the New Jersey State Police bizarrely advised fans via Twitter to 'enjoy the stadium atmosphere until congestion dissipates.'

This is terrible,'said Dan Steidl, of Green Bay. 'I'm ready to get out of here but I don't know when that'll happen.'

It appears that neither did officials, despite having hours to react to the disaster that was the ride in.

Long lines have come to a standstill in front of airport-style security machines that apparently cannot handle the crowd volume. People were squeezed together in an enclosed stairwell.

'Absolutely pathetic, the NFL 
had 40,000 people coming on buses, they knew there was going to be 
45,000 people coming out,' Tammy Ritchie, from Vancouver, Canada, told 
the Star-Ledger. 'We stood in line sweating, it’s absolute horse crap.

As more trains arrived, police tried to thin the sweating, jostling crowd by spreading people across the platform.

Initial fan calls of "Seahawks" and "Broncos" gave way to angry shouts of 'New Jersey, your Super Bowl sucks!'

Law
 enforcement officials in New York and New Jersey have ramped up 
security in anticipation of Super Bowl XLVIII in East Rutherford on 
Sunday, utilizing just about everything in their arsenals - including 
sharp-shooting snipers - to protect those in attendance from any 
possible terrorist attack.

'We
 were stuck in the tunnel for 30 minutes, it was probably 120 degrees,' 
said Jeff Dunbar, from Seattle. ‘People had to take their shirts off, it
 was not good... people were chanting ‘Jersey sucks’ and blaming 
Christie.'

Adding to the confusion was the lack of communication between authorities and passengers.

'Nobody
 is telling anybody what’s going on...people are getting sick, they’re 
feeling claustrophobic, there’s no air in there, there’s no water,' said
 Bob Dowling, of New Providence, New Jersey. 'the wait is incredible, we
 were back there a good one hour and fifteen minutes.'

The
 Super Bowl is what national security officials consider a 'level one 
national security event' and may be a target for terrorists because of 
the level of attention paid to the game. The added security proved to be too much for many in the crowd to handle.

'It
 was 120 degrees in there with no air conditioning, everybody is 
drenched,' said Dave Mannon, of Dallas, Texas. 'They even had to send in
 medics because a few people passed out... I don’t think it’s working, I
 think Governor Christie’s at it again.'

The added security measures also include high-altitude snipers working with security agents on the ground to make sure everyone is safe.

If you have an active shooter or you have anyone who may have a bomb. 
Snipers have a better angle then anyone who is on the ground to actually
 hit that target. It’s an entire team that communicates. You have 
individuals who are at high altitudes inside the arena and then you have
 individuals that are on the ground moving in and around the crowd,' former FBI agent Jonathan Gilliam tells Fox News.

Additionally,
 security officials are reviewing recent terrorist attacks in other 
countries to determine how to prevent them from happening in the U.S.

'Certainly,
 we're keeping an eye on activities around the world, but as of this 
time, there are no threats directed against this event that we're aware 
of,' New York City Police Commissioner William Bratton said a security 
briefing in Manhattan.

Because
 this year's Super Bowl has the distinction of relying on mass transit 
to take up to 30,000 fans to the game, the deadly bombings in the 
southern Russian city of Volograd have raised worries here, said Col. 
Rick Fuentes, head of the New Jersey State Police. The suicide attacks 
on a trolleybus and a train station that killed more than 30 people 
within weeks of the Winter Olympics also prompted a series of meetings 
among the planners for Super Bowl security, he said.

Everyone waits everywhere: Football fans who finally made their way through security checkpoints were then forced to endure waits to get on train to the game

Local officials are counting 
on the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security 'to keep an eye on 
and brief us on those events,' Fuentes said. 'There is a concern with 
mass transit and we've prepared ourselves for it.'

Trains,
 buses and cars taking fans from New York and parts of New Jersey to the
 stadium and back again 'are going to be scanned, they're going to be 
checked, they're going to be swept,' he said.

In
 Manhattan, the NYPD is drawing on its experience securing the annual 
New Year's Eve celebration in Times Square, the New York City Marathon, 
the U.N. General Assembly and other high-profile events to secure 'Super
 Bowl Boulevard,' a 13-block street fair on Broadway.

The
 department has deployed hundreds of extra uniformed and plainclothes 
police officers to the area. It's also relying on bomb-sniffing dogs, 
portable radiation detectors and a vast network of surveillance cameras 
to detect trouble.

In 
the weeks leading up to the Super Bowl, the NYPD rehearsed its response 
to a variety of potential threats, including 'the backpack left 
unsecured scenario,' Bratton said. 'We are very, very well-prepared.'

Target: The Super Bowl is considered by security officials to be a 'level one national security event'

The state police plan to 
assign up to 700 troopers at the stadium on Sunday, Fuentes said. A 
security center has been set up in a hollowed-out building across a 
highway from the stadium that's slated to become a mammoth retail and 
entertainment complex.

A
 24-hour FBI command center will monitor the latest counterterrorism 
intelligence, said Aaron Ford, head of the FBI's Newark office. Measures
 have been taken to protect power grids and to make sure there's plenty 
of backup energy in case of another blackout like the one last year at 
the game in New Orleans, said Jeffrey Miller, the NFL's head of 
security.

'This year 
we're going to try to go blackout free,' Miller said. 'One thing that 
I've learned is that you don't want to be overconfident. You want to 
prepare and be ready. You just don't know what you might face on game 
day.'

Randy Killikevc, a
 tourist from Tennessee who attended a Super Bowl party in Byrant Park 
on Wednesday, said possible threats against the Super Bowl weren't on 
his mind.

'If terrorists were going to strike New York why not do it on New Year's Eve? There's lots more people here (then),' he said.
