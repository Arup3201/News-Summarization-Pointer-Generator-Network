A new study and the latest California gubernatorial debate shined new light on the prominence of illegal immigrants in the state's economy, workforce and schools in the same week President Barack Obama delayed action on the issue.

Researchers at the University of Southern California found that illegal immigrants in the US state with the biggest economy make up nearly 10 per cent of the workforce and contribute $130billion annually to its gross domestic product.

And on Thursday, Governor Jerry Brown said about 30 per cent of California students are undocumented or don't speak English, according to a C-SPAN transcript of the event.

The figures come as President Obama drew a mixture of disappointment and ridicule for postponing promised executive orders on immigration reform until after the midterm elections. 

Obama in June had vowed to sidestep a gridlocked Congress on the issue and take action  by the end of summer.

White House officials said he changed his mind after concluding that circumventing Congress through executive actions during the campaign would politicize the issue and hurt future efforts to pass a broad overhaul.

Obama's decision to delay plans to act on immigration reform infuriated those who have long urged the president to modify his deportation policies

The new figures, however, may push the issue back onto the agenda.

The USC study tried to assess the impact of California's estimated 2.6 million living in the state without permission and shows how integrated they are in everyday life, the Los Angeles Times reported. 

Other key findings from the report include:

'It's a population deeply embedded in the labor market, neighborhoods and social fabric of the state,' USC sociology professor Manuel Pastor, who worked on the report, told the Los Angeles Times.

Advocates for more inclusive immigration policy argue immigrants' economic contributions add to the reasons they should be allowed to stay.

Opponents, however, contend they don't account for the governmental cost of illegal immigrants.

'A bigger economy doesn't mean the people are richer,' said Steven Camarot, of the Center for Immigration Studies, which favors stricter restrictions on immigration.
