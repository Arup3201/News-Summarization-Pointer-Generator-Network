Calvin Johnson practised today in Bagshot

The sight of Calvin Johnson on the practice field is a welcome one to Detroit Lions fans hoping to see the wide receiver at Wembley.

While the All-Pro  did not take part in the open session at Pennyhill Park, the team’s official injury report listed him as a limited participant.

It is the first time in three weeks that Johnson has taken part in practice since spraining his right ankle in the defeat to Buffalo in week five. In his absense, the Lions clinched back-to-back wins with victories against the Vikings and the Saints.

‘Feeling good,’ Johnson said when asked about his fitness on Tuesday. ‘Had a good flight. Most of the guys were sleeping on the way over here, so we're just waking up. But I feel good right now.’

He is set to speak to the media tomorrow morning.

Three tight ends were also absent from the Lions’ first training session in England, with Eric Ebron, Brandon Pettigrew and Joseph Fauria joining defensive end Ziggy Ansah and right tackle LaAdrian Waddle on the sidelines.

‘Obviously, it goes day-to-day with these guys, and both of them are rapidly improving,' Caldwell said of Ebron and Fauria.

‘And I have to sort of wait and see what happens, where the doctors say where they are before we can utilise them. So at this point in time, it's kind of a day-to-day thing, and we'll see how it goes.’

Jim Caldwell was in relaxed mood during his press conference and will hope to take the Lions to 6-2

Meanwhile, running back William Powell was released by the Lions, just two days after landing in England. Rookie safety Jerome Couplin was signed to the practice squad in his place.

‘It’s a difficult thing to do, and you certainly don’t want to do it. A guy just gets here, and within 48 hours he’s heading back home, but that’s kind of the nature of our business.

‘The guys understand it, and I think if you’re up front and tell him exactly why, what the reasons are, it’s a bitter pill to swallow but they understand,’ Caldwell explained.
