At least 32 people have been injured after a train flew off the tracks and up an escalator at Chicago O'Hare Airport in the early hours of Monday.

The Blue Line train derailed at the end of the platform and barreled towards the entrance of the terminals shortly before 3am.

Passengers were taken to three hospitals in the area to be treated for minor injuries following the eight-car derailment. Most of the injured were being treated for neck and back pain, along with bumps and bruises.

The Blue Line service to O'Hare Airport was suspended after Rosemont station. Passengers trying to reach O'Hare Airport from this direction were using shuttle buses.

Chicago Transit Authority investigators, fire fighters and police were reviewing security footage and interviewing the driver and other CTA workers to determine the cause of the accident around 2.50am.

It is unclear if the driver had a medical emergency but he appeared to be walking and talking after the collision and was able to answer questions, investigators said.

The National Transportation Safety Board has been notified.

Chicago Transit Authority spokesman Brian Steele said crews were working to remove the eight-carriage train and fix the escalator and aren't sure when the station will reopen.

The train appeared to have been going too fast as it approached the end-of-line station and didn't stop at a bumping post - a metal shock absorber at the end of the tracks. 

Aftermath: The service at O'Hare, the world's fifth busiest airport, has been suspended and the driver, who survived relatively unscathed, is being interviewed

Witnesses and passengers said the eight-carriage vehicle, which runs seven days a week, 24 hours a day, did not seem to slow as it neared the platform

'The train actually climbed over the last stop, jumped up on the sidewalk and then went up the stairs and escalator,' Chicago Fire Commissioner Jose Santiago said.

'Apparently (it) was traveling at a rate of speed that clearly was higher than a normal train would be,' Mr Steele added.

Mr Santiago told a press conference at
 O’Hare the train operator 'was walking and talking as we were 
investigating,' according to the Chicago Tribune.

An anonymous Transportation Security Administration employee told NBC Chicago: 'I thought it was just a hard stop as the train didn't even slow down when it was coming in. It was chaos.'

busiest airport after Beijing, Heathrow, Atlanta, and Tokyo Haneda. Around 66million passengers pass through a year flying to more than 60 foreign destinations.

The underground station for Blue Line subway trains opened in 1984. It is open 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

The O'Hare branch, the longest section of the Blue Line, uses the firm's oldest vehicles, as well as some of the newest.

Chicago Transit Authority employees were instantly dispatched to repair the damage and try to get the busy station back in working order
