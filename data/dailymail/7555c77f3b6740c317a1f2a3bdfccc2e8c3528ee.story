Some of the Navy's 
futuristic weapons sound like something out of 'Star Wars,' with lasers 
designed to shoot down aerial drones and electric guns that fire 
projectiles at hypersonic speeds.

That future is now.

The
 Navy plans to deploy its first laser on a ship later this year, and it 
intends to test an electromagnetic rail gun prototype aboard a vessel 
within two years.

For the Navy, it's not so 
much about the whiz-bang technology as it is about the economics of such
 armaments. Both costs pennies on the dollar compared with missiles and 
smart bombs, and the weapons can be fired continuously, unlike missiles 
and bombs, which eventually run out.

'It 
fundamentally changes the way we fight,' said Capt. Mike Ziv, program 
manager for directed energy and electric weapon systems for the Naval 
Sea Systems Command.

The Navy's laser 
technology has evolved to the point that a prototype to be deployed 
aboard the USS Ponce this summer can be operated by a single sailor, he 
said.

The solid-state Laser Weapon System is 
designed to target what the Navy describes as 'asymmetrical threats.' 
Those include aerial drones, speed boats and swarm boats, all potential 
threats to warships in the Persian Gulf, where the Ponce, a floating 
staging base, is set to be deployed.

Rail 
guns, which have been tested on land in Virginia, fire a projectile at 
six or seven times the speed of sound - enough velocity to cause severe 
damage. The Navy sees them as replacing or supplementing old-school 
guns, firing lethal projectiles from long distances.

But both systems have shortcomings.

Lasers
 tend to loser their effectiveness if it's raining, if it's dusty, or if
 there's turbulence in the atmosphere, and the rail gun requires vast 
amount of electricity to launch the projectile, said Loren Thompson, 
defense analyst at the Lexington Institute.

'The
 Navy says it's found ways to deal with use of lasers in bad weather, 
but there's little doubt that the range of the weapon would be reduced 
by clouds, dust or precipitation,' he said.

Producing enough energy for a rail gun is another problem.

The
 Navy's new destroyer, the Zumwalt, under construction at Bath Iron 
Works in Maine, is the only ship with enough electric power to run a 
rail gun. The stealthy ship's gas turbine-powered generators can produce
 up to 78 megawatts of power. That's enough electricity for a 
medium-size city - and more than enough for a rail gun.

Technology
 from the three ships in that DDG-1000 series will likely trickle down 
into future warships, said Capt. James Downey, the program manager.

Engineers
 are also working on a battery system to store enough energy to allow a 
rail gun to be operated on warships currently in the fleet.

Both weapon systems are prized because they serve to 'get ahead of the cost curve,' Ziv said.

In other words, they're cheap.

Each
 interceptor missile aboard a U.S. Navy warship costs at least $1 
million apiece, making it cost-prohibitive to defend a ship in some 
hostile environments in which an enemy is using aircraft, drones, 
artillery, cruise missiles and artillery, Thompson said.

With
 a laser operating on about 30 kilowatts of electricity - and possibly 
three times that in the future - the cost amounts to a few dollars per 
shot, Thompson said.

The 'Star Wars' analogy isn't a bad one.

Just
 like in the movies, the Navy's laser directs a beam of energy that can 
burn through a target or fry sensitive electronics. Unlike the movie, 
the laser beam is invisible to the human eye.

The
 targeting system locks onto the target, sending a beam of searing heat. 'You see the effect on what you are targeting but you don't see the 
actual beam,' Ziv said.

Other nations are developing their own lasers, but the Navy is more advanced at this point.

Most folks are stunned to learn the technology is ready for deployment, Ziv said.

'It's
 fair to say that there are other countries working on this technology. 
That's safe to say. But I would also say that a lot of what makes this 
successful came from the way in which we consolidated all of the 
complexity into something that can be operated by (a single sailor),' he
 said.
