A handyman who sliced his hand to the bone with a machete claims he was turned away from a GP surgery - because he was not a registered patient.

Glenn Box, 54, accidentally hacked into his hand while cutting back bushes and stumbled into the local surgery begging for help.

But despite dripping with blood Mr Box was turned away by staff who refused to help him because it was not his usual clinic.

Glenn Box accidentally hacked into his hand with a machete while cutting back bushes. He stumbled into the local surgery begging for help but claims he was denied help because he wasn't a registered patient 

He claims he was forced to drive himself eight miles to hospital where medics told him he had cut though his tendons and gave him 14 stitches.

He said: 'I’m disgusted at the way I was treated. I had been cutting through twigs and branches with my jungle knife when I cut straight through my hand.

'I’m a bit of a Rambo and I’m not squeamish, but was shocked to see I had cut through to the white tendons.

'I have never seen that much blood in all my life so I knew I had to get help straight away.

'Everyone I have told has said they think it is wrong that trained medical staff refuse to help in an emergency.

'I left the surgery in shock and I was losing so much blood I worried I would collapse.

'I decided to try to drive to the hospital, thinking if I started to feel faint I would pull over and call an ambulance.'

Mr Box, from Radstock, Somerset, went to St Mary’s Surgery in nearby Timsbury, but was turned away because he wasn't a registered patient.

He added: 'I had hoped being a local they would bandage me up to stop the flow of blood - but they just pretty much told me to go away.

Mr Box, whose registered GP is in a village three miles away - eventually drove to the Royal United Hospital in Bath, where he was treated and given 14 stitches.

Jackie Yeates, practice manager at St Mary’s, said: 'I cannot comment on the individual case but the general rule is that you should go to your own surgery if it is within the local area as they are best placed to treat you as they have your medical records.

'If someone has minor injuries the best option is to go to Paulton Hospital but this again depends on the individual situation.'

She added she was unaware of the situation at the surgery at the time of Mr Box's visit on September 9.

But she added it may have been the case there were no doctors or nurses at the surgery at the time due to afternoon home visits.
