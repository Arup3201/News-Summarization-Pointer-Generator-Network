Haji Gulalainow, a former Afghan spy services chief, now lives in a two-storey pink house in a Los Angeles suburbs with his family

During the height of his tenure as Afghanistan's notorious 'torturer-in-chief' he was feared by his victims, subjecting them to electric shocks and vicious beatings.

But now Haji Gulalai, the former head of Afghan spy services, has allegedly forged a new life in Southern California, where he is said to occupy a pink, two-storey stucco house in a quiet Los Angeles suburb.

Gulalai, now in his early 60s, was once a key figure in the Afghanistan war -  'a big wheel in a machine that ground up a lot of people', the Washington Post reports.

In Kandahar he ran the spy services operations following the US-led invasion in 2001. How he left behind that brutal career in Afghanistan and landed in L.A. - in an area that is said to remind him of the dry heat and landscape of Kandahar - is unclear.

Gulalai
 was able to bypass immigration barriers faced by Afghans whose work for
 the United States made them potential targets of the Taliban, the paper reports.

Despite links to the United States intelligence services, the CIA denied aiding his entry.

He
 was among a group of Pashtuns who were chosen to try and seize the 
Taliban stronghold, and had previously been involved in CIA-backed 
efforts to oust Soviet forces.

Gulalai, whose real name is Kamal
 Achakzai, went on to lead the National Directorate of Security (NDS), 
which was funded by U.S. intelligence agencies and faced allegations of 
human rights abuses.

New life: Gulalai, then an Afghan intelligence chief, is in sunglasses to the right of Afghan President Hamid Karzai in 2002

A secret memo from 2007 named Gulalai as the main culprit behind the the NDS's 'systematic' torturing.

It said he was 'personally involved in conducting beatings amounting to torture, in 
detaining suspects illegally and arbitrarily and in deliberately and 
systematically evading detention monitoring.'

His methods were said to include sleep
 deprivation for as long as 13 days and would suspend inmates from the 
ceiling with handcuffs.

Some claimed his extreme tactics even pushed neutral Afghans towards enemy factions. However his supporters have said his job was crucial to the protection of the city.

In the Southern California community he now allegedly calls home, Gulalai is said to be surrounded by a network of Afghans.

The front yard of his L.A. property has a locked gate, is surrounded by a white fence and has citrus trees scattered around it.

Bashir Wasifi, who attended school with Gulalai in the 1960s before moving to the California in 1979 said: 'We see each other every weekend, we play cards together.'

'His position was a cruel position so he did cruel things, but he is not like that.'

He claimed the former officer arrived with more than a dozen of his relatives.

Similarities: The former intelligence chief is said to be fond of the Los Angeles suburbs because it reminds him of the landscape surrounding the city where he grew up

Conditions: He is also said to like the 'dry heat' at his new home because of its likeness to Kandahar (pictured)

Oppositon: Retired General John R Allen stopped prison transfers to the NDS because of fears over human rights abuses

Since he has settled in the community, he is said to have learned little English and is unemployed.

Neighbours said he lives with a number of children, ranging in age from toddlers to someone in their twenties.

Since he has moved, the UN have begun a more comprehensive investigation into the methods used by the NDS.

Retired Marine General John R. Allen suspended prisoner transfers to the 
security service after reports of abuse, and said the organisation 
relied on torture as an institutional 'reflex'.

During his time as a leading 
intelligence official, he was said to have operated under a 'culture of 
impunity' because of his link to international organisations.

The Taliban tried to kill him on 
numerous occasions and supporting factions tried to remove him from his post.

He was nearly fired twice from the NDS, after UN Officials tried to persuade the then head Armullah Saleh to fire him.

But

 the orders were not followed because of ethnic politics and he was 
subsequently promoted and ended up in charge of the main prison in 
Kabul.
