A mother of a teenage boy who was shot dead by his grandmother smiled as she left court on Tuesday after the 75-year-old was convicted of second-degree murder.

Jennifer Hoffman described her mother Sandra Layne as a 'monster' outside the Michigan courtroom where she had been found guilty of killing 17-year-old Jonathan.

Layne shot her grandson six times during an argument last spring as he pleaded with 911 responders to help him on the phone at the West Bloomfield Township home.

Layne, a mother-of-five and retired schoolteacher, is expected to serve at least 14 years after a jury convicted her following two days of deliberations at the Pontiac court.

Following the verdict, Ms Hoffman told the Detroit Free Press that she was happy that her mother had been found guilty.

She added: 'I know my son is in heaven and that is a place she’ll never see.'

Hoffman had been living with his grandparents since 2011 when his parents divorced and moved to Arizona.

The elderly woman's husband Fred Layne wept in court as his wife was shackled and taken away by officers.

Layne struck grandson Jonathan Hoffman with six of
ten shots fired over a six-minute span on May 18, 2012.

During the two-week trial, the jury heard a recording of 
the 17-year-old's desperate call to 911 and even more shots while he was
on the line.

'My grandma shot me. I'm going to die. Help. I got shot again,' Hoffman told a dispatcher as he gasped for air.

Prosecutor Paul Walton told jurors that Layne never rushed out of the West Bloomfield Township home, despite claiming to be afraid of her grandson, and never called for an ambulance to help him.

She claimed that she shot him after Hoffman struck her during a heated argument about money and a plan to flee Michigan because of a failed drug test.

'She told the court last week: 'I wanted him to pay attention to me. 
He had to listen.

''It wasn't a conversation. It was arguing. Swearing.'

But Walton pointed 
out that Layne never complained to police about being attacked.

A 
hospital nurse who examined her after her arrest said Layne had no 
injuries and spoke lovingly about Hoffman.

Defense attorney Jerome Sabbota asked jurors to view the incident through the eyes of a woman in her 70s.

He said Layne was taking care of a teen 
who had used drugs and brought strangers to the home. Hoffman's parents 
were in Arizona during his senior year of high school.

''Her adrenalin is pumping. You're not calm,' Sabbota said in his closing remarks. 'Boom, boom, boom - you pull the trigger.'

During her emotional testimony last week, Sandra Layne said that it was a difficult arrangement, especially after her grandson was treated in a hospital for using hallucinogenic drugs.

Layne said Hoffman was deeply upset on the day of the shooting after testing positive for so-called synthetic marijuana. She said she had to stop the car three times on the way home to calm him down.

'He's got to sit down. We've got to make a plan,' Layne told the jury. 'He's got to talk to people, his mother, his father.

'We're screaming at each other. He said, ''I'm getting out of here. They're going to put me in jail.'' ... He had to stay here. We had to resolve things here.'

Layne said she shot the teen during another argument later at her home. She acknowledged in her testimony that she told police that she had 'murdered' Hoffman.

'I recall saying a few things. I'm screaming, hysterical,' Layne told the jurors.
