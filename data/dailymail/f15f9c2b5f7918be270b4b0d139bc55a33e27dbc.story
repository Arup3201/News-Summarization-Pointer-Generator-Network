A star Vanderbilt student has testified in her alleged rapists' trial that she only knew she had been assaulted when she watched video footage of the alleged attack.

The woman, whose identity is being concealed, took to the stand in Nashville, Tennessee on Thursday in the rape trials of former football players Brandon Vandenburg and Cory Batey.

The men and two of their teammates stand accused of sexually assaulting the unconscious woman in a dorm room after a night of drinking in June 2013.

The court has already heard testimony from other witnesses that the woman had been assaulted with a water bottle, smacked, raped and urinated on while Vandenburg 'egged on' the men.

Accused: Brandon Vandenburg, left, and Cory Batey, right, are on trial in Nashville, Tennessee for sexually assaulting an unconscious woman in a dorm room at Vanderbilt in June 2013

On Thursday, the alleged victim recounted how she had drank more alcohol than usual while out with friends at a local bar, the Tin Roof, and while there, she bumped into Vandenburg, whom she was dating. 

The last thing she can remember is being in the bar at around midnight, she said.

'I remember waking up in an unfamiliar room at 8-something the next morning,' she said. 

After the alleged attack, she had walked to a friend's neighboring room and slept there for about three hours. She woke up feeling disorientated, sick and in pain, she said.

She recalled how she felt pain on some parts of her body, such as her shoulder, wrist and knee, but she did not feel as if she had been sexually assaulted.

'I was sore all over but those hurt particularly badly,' she recalled.

That afternoon, the woman said that Vandenburg invited her to his room before initiating sex

 They had unprotected sex for a few seconds, which left her 'confused', she said.

Injuries: Katherine Parnell, a nurse at Metro General who carried out a rape kit on the victim, said the young woman had multiple bruises across her thighs and buttocks, and scratches on her feet

In the days after, she became 'somewhat' aware of rumors about the incident, she said, but when she texted with Vandenburg, he insisted that he was 'getting blamed for stuff that didn't even happen'.

Initially the woman offered to help him, she said. 

Several days after the alleged assault, she went to Metro General to undergo a rape kit. 

The nurse who attended to her, Katherine Parnell, testified on Thursday that rape kits are usually carried out within 72 hours of the incident - putting the woman's outside that window.

Parnell had noted that the student had multiple bruises across her thighs and buttocks, scratches on her ankles and a wound to her knee.

By looking at how the injuries were healing, it appeared they had likely occurred around the time of the incident, Parnell testified.

She added that when the woman came to the hospital, she could recall nothing of an alleged assault, including whether or not she had had sex or if condoms had been worn. 

Shocking: The victim's former roommate took the stand on Wednesday to describe what she looked like the morning after the attack, expressing her shock at how disheveled her friend had appeared

It was only later that the woman watched cell phone footage from the assault and identified herself as the victim, she said, The Tennessean reported. She only watched it once, she said.

The jury previously heard how Vandenburg had sent footage and pictures of the alleged attack to friends in California before urging them to delete it the following morning. 

'Did you consent to any of the acts done to you?' Prosecutor Tom Thurman asked the woman.

'Absolutely not,' she responded.

On Wednesday, the woman's best friend described how her then-roommate's distressing appearance the morning after the attack is said to have occurred.   

Lauren Miller said she went to a bar with the victim the night leading up to the attack, and told the court her reaction the next time she saw her friend the following morning. 

She says her roommate came back to their condo with a gash on her leg, looking ill and 'out of it'. 

'My immediate reaction was "Woah, what happened to you?"' Miller recalled. 

Co-accused: Former Vanderbilt players Jaborian 'Tip' McKenzie (left) and Brandon Banks (right) also face charges connected to the alleged rape. McKenzie testified that he did not touch the woman

'So just from a physical standpoint, starting from top to bottom, her makeup was completely disheveled, the one thing I very clearly remember was the state of her hair. She had had it curled the night before and I remember being like, "'Did you go jump in a pool?"'

She says she also found her roommate's black heel on the lawn outside their condo, and later overheard a voicemail message left by Vandenburg that her friend played on speaker.

'I heard him talking to (the woman) and saying he had just gotten out of football meeting, and he was being accused of some very horrible things that he did not do,' Miller recalled. 'And he was telling (the woman) to not believe anything she heard.'  

Vandenburg and former teammates Cory Batey, Jaborian 'Tip' McKenzie and Brandon Banks face five counts of aggravated rape and two counts of aggravated sexual battery.

Vandenburg faces an additional charge of tampering with evidence and unlawful photography.  

Two other former Vanderbilt athletes took the stand as well on Wednesday to give their witness accounts of the event. 

Questions: Miles Finley, Vandenburg's friend from California, told jurors he was receiving graphic videos from his friend on the night of the attack but did not know that the alleged rape was happening at the time

'Enablers': Former Vanderbilt athletes Michael Retta (left) and Dillon Van Der Wal (right) testified on Wednesday that they saw the victim passed out in front of Vandenburg's door but did not inform police

Then Vanderbilt tennis player Michael Retta and football player Dillon Van Der Wal told the jury that they saw the victim lying outside of Vandenburg's room that morning but neither reported the incident to police at the time. 

They both gave conflicting reports about whether Vandenburg asked for help moving the girl to his bed.

Retta says he saw the alleged victim naked in the morning hours of June 23, while Van Der Wall said he saw the woman with 'handprints on her buttocks'. 

He also described Vandenburg's emotions that morning, saying he was 'extremely fidgety,' 'not acting normal,' and pacing.  

The prosecution rested on Thursday afternoon. The trial was expected to last 10 days but is now in its third week.
