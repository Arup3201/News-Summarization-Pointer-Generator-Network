Tragic: Cory Monteith died from a lethal combination of heroin and alcohol, it has been revealed

Cory Monteith died from a lethal combination of heroin and alcohol, it has been revealed.

The Glee actor, who was found dead in his hotel room on Saturday at the age of 31, died from a 'mixed drug toxicity, involving heroin and alcohol,'  according to authorities. 

The British Columbia Coroners Service revealed the autopsy results on Tuesday, adding that the investigation into
 his death is continuing, and that no further details were available at 
this time.

It was noted that at this stage there is
 still no evidence to suggest that Mr. Monteith's death was 'anything 
other than a most-tragic accident'.

Police Constable Brian Montague said, 'There was evidence in the room that was consistent of a drug overdose,' said Constable Brian Montague, adding that he wouldn't 'go into specifics'. 

The cause of death has come as a shock to some after it was initially reported that police did not believe drugs to have been involved, but Montague explained they need to err on the side of caution.

'It was the opinion of the investigators that it was a drug overdose, but we didn’t want to speculate,' he said. 'The last thing we would want to do is speculate a drug overdose and then have that not be the case.'

It was also confirmed that Monteith's family have been made aware of the circumstances surrounding the death.

'Profound
 loss': Monteith's girlfriend Lea Michele released a statement through 
her rep on Monday, claiming she is 'grieving alongside' his family 

Monteith's girlfriend Lea Michele 
released a statement through her rep on Monday afternoon, claiming she 
is 'grieving alongside' Monteith's family.

'Lea is deeply grateful for all the 
love and support she’s received from family, friends, and fans. Since 
Cory’s passing, Lea has been grieving alongside his family and making 
appropriate arrangements with them,' the 26-year-old Glee actress’ rep 
told People.

'They
 are supporting each other as they endure this profound loss together. 
We continue to ask the media to respect the privacy of Lea and Cory’s 
family,' the rep added.

Police expedited Monteith's autopsy and toxicology report Monday due to the widespread publicity of his sudden death.

A medical team from the Vancouver Coastal Health Authority performed the postmortem exam.

Tragic end: Monteith was found dead in his hotel room at the Fairmont Pacific Rim Hotel in Vancouver on Saturday night

'Mr. Monteith was alone [in his hotel room] when he died,' a Vancouver Police Department spokesperson said. 'He took the heroin when he was alone by himself.'

Monteith was found dead in his hotel room at the Fairmont Pacific Rim Hotel in Vancouver on Saturday around noon.

It is still unclear what happened to Monteith in the hours leading up to his death.

He and his manager dined on Thursday night with Maureen Webb, the co-founder of Project Limelight Society, who said the actor 'looked so good, so healthy'.

According to authorities, Monteith and three unidentified people left his hotel room on Friday night and that the actor returned alone at around 2:15 a.m. Hotel staff found his body shortly after noon when Monteith didn't check out.

The three individuals were questioned and the Police Department representative said, 'They were all cooperative,' adding that no arrests were made.

It follows claims the star led a 'double life' as a hard-worker when in 
Los Angeles, and a substance-abuser whenever he would return to his 
native Canada.

Monteith, who checked into rehab in 
March, managed to stay clean while on the Glee set, but his resolve to 
stay sober weakened whenever he visited Vancouver, a source told TMZ.

According to sources, Monteith's 
girlfriend and Glee costar Lea Michele, along with the rest of the hit 
television show's cast, were aware of his addiction problems and worked 
hard to keep him clean and sober.

Monteith allegedly never showed up for work under the influence of drugs or alcohol and abstained from these substances 'most of the time.'

But his life in Canada painted a different picture.

Monteith allegedly returned to his hometown of Vancouver often, and surrounded himself with friends who fueled his addiction.

Drugs and alcohol were reportedly 'always involved.'

Monteith's family is said to have been aware that he reverted back to his hard-partying ways in the North American city, but they were unable to help.

His family members reportedly became 'alarmed' recently at his behaviour and tried to come to his aid, but he grew 'distant.'

The Glee Project, a reality TV series were hopefuls competed for roles on Glee, has been cancelled after two seasons, the Oxygen network confirmed on Tuesday. A spokesperson said: 'The Glee Project will not be returning to Oxygen, but we are extremely proud of this series which launched the careers of several talented individuals.' Sources insist the cancellation was unrelated to Cory Monteith's death, adding that the decision was made 'several weeks ago.' The show had discovered quite a few singers who guest-starred on Fox's award-winning sitcom, including Damian McGinty, Samuel Larsen, Blake Jenner and Alex Newell.

But another website claims Monteith attended a number of Alcoholic Anonymous meetings shortly before he died.

A source close to the actor told gossip website RadarOnline.com: 'Cory went to AA meetings when he got to Vancouver with some friends of his and mine. They have attended AA meetings in the past together.

'Vancouver is a great place to keep grounded when you are in the spotlight and trying to be sober.'

'Being grounded is the key to sobriety and that's what Vancouver can offer Cory. It is casual and he calls it home and he has friends here who have known him for a long time.'

The insider also insisted that despite being spotted out with friends at the Portside bar in the hours before his death, Cory was not drinking.

Meanwhile, FOX officials said it is too soon to say how Monteith's death will be handled on Glee.

According to FOX news, producers are scheduling meetings to discuss how to move forward without his character, Finn Hudson.

Industry experts predict Monteith's death will have a serious effect on the hit show, which was scheduled to start shooting next month.
