Gary Lyon has been jailed for stealing from his own mother and conning people into giving him money by telling them his daughter was lying in hospital and he needed cash to get to see her

A conman who duped strangers into giving him money by pretending his 11-year-old daughter had cancer has been jailed for 18 months.

Gary Lyon, 47, told generous well-wishers that his child was lying, gravely ill, in hospital in Manchester 'with tubes coming out of her arms.'

In fact, a daughter of Lyon, who is now 15, had contracted leukaemia in 2009 when she was younger but had made a full recovery.

Lyon scammed victims by falsely claiming he had run out of petrol on the way to see her in hospital.

On one occasion he targeted an 80-year-old woman after he told her his bank card had snapped and he needed £20 to buy fuel.

Graham Robinson, prosecuting, said: 'The first complainant... was was approached by the defendant who used a ruse he was to repeat many times, saying his daughter was in The Christie Hospital and he had run out of petrol.'

The father of two from Sharston, near Wythenshawe, Manchester claimed he would repay the cash but gave a false name and telephone number.

On another occasion, he was given £10 by a stranger after saying he needed to pick his daughter up from hospital following surgery to treat leukaemia. He even told the victim: 'Mate, that's really not enough. £20 will see me through.'

In yet another incident, Lyon showed a tattoo of his daughter's name to a man and after getting £20 said: 'I swear on my daughter's life I will pay you back.'

Lyon told a fourth victim who gave him £40: 'You are the kindest man I ever met.'

Manchester Crown Court heard that in addition to the frauds, jobless Lyon, who has 42 previous convictions, repeatedly stole from his 70-year-old disabled mother, Anna.

Whilst she was on holiday in America, Lyon stole her bank card and began plundering her funds in order to fund his £50-a-day crack cocaine habit.

The court heard Lyon stole the bank card and used a mobility scooter before withdrawing £1,500 on 23 occasions using a telephone banking service. She returned from her holiday to find her son had taken £6,000 worth of jewellery which was later retrieved from a pawnbrokers.

One of Lyon's victims admitted he was suspicious of Lyon's sob story and even told him: 'If you are lying, you will go to hell.'

Lyon told  one of his victims that his daughter was in Manchester's Christie Hospital 'with tubes in her arms'

He later told police: 'I didn't really believe a word but thought it's better to be conned than be wrong and this is someone genuinely in that situation.'

Lyon pleaded guilty to four thefts, eight counts of fraud and one count of taking a vehicle without the owner's consent.

In mitigation, defence counsel Tom McKail said: 'The offences committed by this defendant against the public are deplorable and he is disgusted and embarrassed by his behaviour.

'He has also taken advantage of a previously supporting and loving family and apologises to all parties who have been affected by his behaviour and selfish ways.

'At the end of 2012 the defendant's daughter did indeed suffer from leukaemia but recovered, but while given the all clear his relationship with his then-partner, the mother of his two daughters deteriorated. As a by-product he fell back into a way of life he believed he had left behind.'

Sentencing Lyon, judge Miss Recorder Fiona Barry said: 'You repeatedly used your daughter's previous ill health to illicit sympathy and generosity to fund your drug addiction. Some victims were vulnerable and another was scared. It is not possible to suspend this sentence.'
