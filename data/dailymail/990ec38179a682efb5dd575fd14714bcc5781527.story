First it was the NFL. Now the NBA will sign it's first ever openly gay player.

Jason Collins, 35, signed the Brooklyn Nets and may play as soon as Sunday night in a game against the Lakers.

The New York Post reports that Collins came out in a Sports Illustrated article last May but that he hadn't signed with an NBA team that season yet.

Originally Glen Davis was going to go with the Nets but he went with the Los Angeles Clippers instead

When Nets players were asked about how they felt about having a gay teammate, they responded with openness and understanding.

'It's 2014' said Deron Williams on Friday.

Micheal Sam became the first openly gay NFL player a few weeks ago, paving the way for gay males in American sports.

'Michael Sam just came out, and his teammates welcomed him, and they’re in college. It’s time for the NBA, as well,' said Williams.

Yahoo Sports reports that the Nets originally wanted Glen Davis, but that when he decided to sign with the Los Angelos Clippers they had to go back to the drawing board.

News broke on Thursday that Collins, who
 already worked with the Nets earlier in the week, would be accepted as a
 player on the Nets regardless of his sexuality.

'If he can help our team, I’m all for it...I think he’s a great role player. I played with his brother for five and a half years, and they have similar games, so I’ve known Jason for years … he could help our team,' said Williams.

Nets coach Jason Kidd actually played alongside Collins for six and a half seasons and is familiar with Collins' playing abilities.

Collins played for seven years with the Nets from 2001-2008 and also played with Kevin garnett and Paul Pierce with the Boston Celtics.

'I think it’s important that anybody who has capabilities and skill level to have a chance to do something he’s great at or one of the things he’s good at,'his teammate Garnett said.

'I think it’d be biased and, in a sense racist, if you were to take that opportunity from a person,' he continued.

Collins has been out of the NBA since completeing the 2012-2013 season with the Washington Wizards but he's ready to jump back into the game and his team is happy to have him.
