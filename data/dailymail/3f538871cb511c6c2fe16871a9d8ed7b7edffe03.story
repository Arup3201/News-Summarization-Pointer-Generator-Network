Labour last night unveiled plans to save £250million by scrapping police commissioners and quadrupling the cost of gun licenses.

Yvette Cooper said the money, which would be saved from the Home Office budget, would help protect frontline policing in the first of Labour's reviews of Whitehall's departments to see where money can be saved. 

Plans for the Home Office include plans to make savings of at least £172million a year by reforming police procurement through mandatory joint purchasing of equipment by police forces.

Elected Police and Crime Commissioners will be scrapped, saving £50million next year - in order to save the 1,100 police officers set to be axed according to Home Office plans for 2015/16.

And the cost of a gun license will be put up from £50 to almost £200. The implementation of full-cost recovery for gun licensing will raise £17.2million a year. Another £9million will come from increased fees for police driver offender retraining.

Yvette Cooper, the Shadow Home Secretary, said: 'Under the Tories' policies and spending plans, another 1,100 police officers are due to be cut next year alone, with the police warning that many more officers and vital public duties are at risk.

'This first stage of Labour's Zero-Based Review of the Home Office shows how Labour plans can make savings to help get the deficit down and prevent 1,100 officers being cut next year.

'The police are already struggling to cope with growing crimes such as violent crime, child sex exploitation, online child abuse and online fraud, and prosecutions are falling as they can't get cases to trial.' 

Labour's policing report has highlighted several instances of poor management in Home Office police spending.

This includes deep disparities in the cost of equipment purchased by individual forces – for example the price paid for high-visibility jackets varying fivefold between £20 and £100.

In a separate announcement yesterday, Ed Miliband called for new regulations to help crack down on 'rogue' job agencies.

The Labour leader said he wanted to see a system of licensing for recruitment agencies, saying some of them break minimum wage laws and exploit workers by undercutting the pay of permanent staff.

He also called for a 'national mission' to create 400,000 extra engineers by 2020. Labour has been carrying out so-called 'zero-based reviews' of each government department, to see where money can be saved.

Chris Leslie, Labour's Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury, said: 'The next Labour government will finish the job of balancing the books but we will do so in a fairer way by making different choices from the Tories.' 

Last night a Conservative spokesman said: 'Nobody will believe a word Labour say on the deficit – they've opposed every step we've taken to cut it, and the independent IFS say Labour's policy means £28billion more borrowing and more debt.

'And because Ed Miliband forgot even to mention the deficit in what he called his job interview for being Prime Minister, it's clear that he's just not up to it.'
