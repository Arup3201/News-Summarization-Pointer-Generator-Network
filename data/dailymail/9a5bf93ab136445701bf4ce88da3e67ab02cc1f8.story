Leonardo da Vinci can add 'weatherman' to his already dizzying array of talents, according to a new book.

Geologist and Renaissance art expert Ann Pizzorusso claims the artist, architect, musician, mathematician, engineer, inventor, anatomist, geologist, cartographer, botanist and writer was also the first to see the swirling patterns of water and air at the heart of a hurricane.

She came to this conclusion after seeing drawings of biblical floods by Leonardo in the Royal Collection at Windsor Castle and outlines them in her book Tweeting da Vinci.

Vortex: Geologist and Renaissance art expert Ann Pizzorusso claims Leonardo da Vinci to the first to see the swirling patterns of water and air at the heart of a hurricane, as evidenced by this drawing

Was da Vinci once again hundreds of years ahead of his time? Right, a satellite image of a hurricane

Pizzorusso says the sketches, drawn between 1514 and 1518, reveal the distinctive 'vortex flow patterns' discovered by meteorologists in the 1970s using satellite technology. 

'I found something extraordinary,' she told The Sunday Times. 'These patterns are similar to hurricane configurations so familiar to us today.

'Some of them swirl in a clockwise direction and some anti-clockwise. That's very much what happens in the atmosphere.

Her theory has been backed by Professor Liz Bentley, chief executive of the Royal Meteorological Society.

The inventor came up with designs for tanks and helicopters and in 2008 a Swiss daredevil trusted to his genius by creating a parachute from one of his designs

However, a Renaissance scholar says da Vinci is known to have observed numerous natural phenomena and claims the vortices could easily represent something else.

It is not the first time Da Vinci, who was born in April 1452 in Tuscany and died in May 1519 in Amboise, France, was centuries ahead of his time.

The inventor came up with designs for tanks and helicopters and in 2008 a Swiss daredevil trusted to his genius by creating a parachute from one of his designs.

Olivier Vietti-Teppa, 36, jumped  using a parachute based on sketches made by the Italian Renaissance artist in 1485.

He said after the jump in Payerne, near Geneva: 'It worked perfectly. I was unable to steer it, but I just glided gracefully to the ground.'

However, he admitted he had been wearing a modern reserve parachute in case da Vinci's design - made out of four triangles of fabric and with a pointed top - had failed to open.
