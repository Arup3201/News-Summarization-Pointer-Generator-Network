The name's Warburton, Sam Warburton: The captain's James Bond moment

In days of old, self-respecting rugger players proudly sported a battered face and a beer belly.

But relaxing in the sea after a training session yesterday, the muscle bound British and Irish Lions squad looked more like film stars than hardened sportsmen.

Emerging from the water with their torsos rippling, they bore a resemblance to James Bond actor Daniel Craig in his swimming trunks during a scene from 2006 film Casino Royale.

The Lions pictured taking part in the post training recovery session at City Beach in Perth, Australia included captain Sam Warburton, who is currently recovering from injury and stand in captain Brian O'Driscoll.

Fly-half Owen Farrell, Samoan born England powerhouse Manu Tuilagi and Matt Stevens were also among the players larking about in the water.

They may not be looking so pretty after tomorrow's (Wednesday) opening game of the tour in Australia.

Matt Hodgson, who captains their opponents Western Force, warned yesterday that even if they couldn't beat the Lions they hoped to 'hurt their bodies'.

His team-mate, scrum-half Brett Sheehan, added: 'We want it to be an extremely physical game. We want them to know they've been in a battle.'

The Lions beat Barbarians 59-8 during a stopover in Hong Kong on route to Australia at the weekend, but the match was over-shadowed by an ugly spat between Farrell and hooker Schalk Brits.

They will play a series of warm up games before the first of three test against Australia in Brisbane on June 22.

Horseplay: The players let loose after an intense training session. They will be playing warm-up games before their scheduled test matches

Warm-up games on Lions tours have been brutal affairs in the past, most infamously in 2001, when New South Wales Waratahs full back Duncan McRae punched Lions fly-half Ronan O'Gara 11 times as he lay on the ground unable to defend himself.

O'Gara required eight stiches following the vicious attack. McRae was sent off and later banned for seven weeks.

Keeping in shape: Owen Farrell ran from the sea to the beach in sunny Perth, making sure his fitness levels don't drop between games
