The parents of an 18-month-old girl who died after left strapped in a car seat in a hot room for several hours have been sentenced to time behind bars.

Authorities say Kimberly and Jacob Taschler’s daughter Kayla died after left without food or water for 16 hours in their Palmerton, Pennsylvania home in 2010.

A judge on Thursday sentenced Kimberly Taschler, 30, to 14 months to 3 1/2 years in prison while her husband, 36, was sentenced to 11 months to two years.

Sentenced: Parents Kimberly & Jacob Taschler were sentenced to time behind bars in the death of their 18-month-old daughter found starved and dehydrated in their Pennsylvania home

Both parents cried in Carbon County court on Thursday. Kimberly Taschler said she was overwhelmed at the time of the baby’s death and didn't seek proper help.

Authorities had alleged that the Taschlers had long neglected Kayla even before her death in January.

She was found weighing just 13lbs when her mother brought her to Palmerton Hospital. Police believe she had been dead for several hours before arriving.

In July of this year prosecutors said that Kayla had missed doctors' appointments, had suffered excessive weight and muscle loss and was not properly provided with fluids and food.

A defense attorney had called the baby's autopsy report 'junk science' this week.

'The problems occurred in the last days, the last day really. I really don’t have an explanation as to why in terms of why is this child bound for dehydration, why, when there is food in the stomach, there is wasting,' their attorney George Dydynsky told WNEP in July.

In court Jacob Tashler said he loves all his children, having two others who are currently in foster care since Kayla's death.

Prosecutors say the mother received a longer sentence because she was home when the baby died and was her primary caretaker.

Both pleaded guilty to charges in July - Jacob Tashler to endangering the welfare of a child and Kimberly Tashler to involuntary manslaughter and endangering the welfare of a child.
