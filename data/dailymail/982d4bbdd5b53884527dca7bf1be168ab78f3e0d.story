An experienced climber from Oklahoma died in a freak accident on Monday morning, while mountaineering in a national park.

Mary Margaret Bilyeu, known to her friends as Mimi, was on a guided ascent of the Grand Teton mountains in Wyoming when she fell.

By the time rescuers reached the 44-year-old, who has two teenage children, she was unresponsive and could not be revived.

Family and friends were shocked to hear that the avid climber, who had tackled Africa's Mount Kilimanjaro earlier this year, had died in an accident.

'It was 
unimaginable that this could happen,' her brother and climbing partner John Conley told OK News.

'She was a very
 advanced climber. She was an all-around fitness buff.'

When she wasn't tackling summits, Bilyeu was described as a devoting mother and wife, who was always willing to help a friend in need.

She had taken her daughter Kyndal with her to Kenya earlier this year to spend time at an orphanage.

The friends she made there were also saddened to hear of Bilyeu's death.

Jennifer Whitener, of Maisha International which organized the Kenya trip, said she was shocked to hear of the accident.

She told the Edmond Sun the mother had died doing what she loved best, and that the foundation was talking about ways to reach out and help her family.

A spokeswoman for the national park Bilyeu had been hiking in when she died said an investigation into the events leading up to the mother's fall has been started.
