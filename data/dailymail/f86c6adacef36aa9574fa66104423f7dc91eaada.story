A teacher has been awarded £230,000 in compensation after slipping on a ketchup sachet while walking down a hallway (file picture)

A teacher has been awarded £230,000 after he slipped on a sachet of tomato ketchup in a school corridor.

He suffered severe injuries in the fall as he was walking out of the staff room at a secondary school in Essex.

The
 personal injury claim was settled outside court by council chiefs who 
believed they may have been forced to shell out up to £500,000 including
 legal fees if the case had gone ahead.

Yesterday
 it emerged that the payout was one of 34 handed to injured teachers in 
the county between 2011 and 2013 – and who received a total of 
£1.05million.

Critics have 
now complained of a ‘compensation culture’ in schools after it was 
revealed that other staff had claimed for slipping on wet floors or 
being injured by a cupboard door.

The
 teacher in the ketchup incident was hurt on March 18 2008, but did not 
file a claim until March 10 2011 – just eight days before the three-year
 legal time limit for making personal injury claims.

A
 Freedom of Information request revealed that the council agreed a final
 settlement of £230,000 in April last year, including £90,000 in damages
 for pain, suffering and loss of amenity as well as damages for losses 
such as those relating to earnings and pension.

The payout also included £120,000 for the teacher’s legal fees and £20,000 in other costs.

Other
 claims to emerge include a £110,000 settlement to a member of staff who
 suffered a spinal injury after slipping on a wet floor on two separate 
occasions on the same day.

Another employee received £39,450 after 
suffering a wrist injury when a faulty metal door swung open when they 
were taking plates to a cupboard.

Jonathan
 Isaby of the TaxPayers’ Alliance said: ‘The compensation culture 
appears to be more common in the school yard than a grazed knee.

'Wasting
 taxpayers’ money on unnecessary payouts leaves less money available for
 teaching and higher tax bills for everyone else.

The payment was part of more than £1million of compensation payments made to injured teachers by Essex County Council over the past three years (file picture)

‘Legal
 costs on top of the actual payouts only add to the overall bill and the
 whole process undermines the ability of teachers to actually teach.

'It’s time schools resisted unscrupulous claims before teachers are 
unable to leave the staff room for fear of the school being sued.’

However,
 Jerry Glazier, the National Union of Teachers representative for Essex,
 said there is no compensation culture in schools.

He
 said: ‘We need to see these claims in context.

'As a union we will 
support members who pursue claims for personal injury when we feel they 
have been poorly treated by management in schools.

‘Schools are generally very safe environments but employers have a duty of care to protect both teachers and pupils.’

Essex
 County Council said it takes ‘health, safety and wellbeing’ seriously, 
adding that all compensation claims are investigated and damages paid if
 the authority is liable.
