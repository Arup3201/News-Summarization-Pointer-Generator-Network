Radio DJ Mel Greig is one of the latest female Australian celebrities to have stepped in front of the camera to tackle the sort of vile abuse dished out online.

Ms Greig, who was famously engulfed in scandal in 2012 after she participated in a radio prank call to the London hospital where the Duchess of Cambridge was being treated for morning sickness, was subjected to particularly brutal comments, in a video posted on Mamamia.

Shortly after the incident, the English nurse, Jacintha Saldanha, who took the call, sadly committed suicide and in a note she left blamed the radio presenters for ending her own life.

Ms Greig, who was famously engulfed in scandal in 2012 after she participated in a radio prank call to the London hospital where the Duchess of Cambridge was being treated for morning sickness, was subjected to particularly brutal comments. 

Ms Greig was part of another batch of female Australian celebrities have stepped in front of the camera to tackle the sort of vile abuse dished out online

'I've made a noose Mel, and it belongs around your neck. I can't wait to take your last breath,' one tweet read.

'You've killed a mother so it's only fair we kill yours. You'll never sleep again. I'm coming for you and your mum,' another said.   

A third tweet read: 'An eye for an eye. Kill yourself or I'll kill you and everyone you care about.'

ABC journalist Annabel Crabb, former model and now human rights campaigner Imogen Bailey, radio host Mel Grieg, Today Show presenter Sylvia Jeffreys, Mamamia Editor-in-Chief Jamilia Rizvi and Mamamia TV host Shelly Horton took part in the video. 

Model Imogen Bailey copped the worst of the bad bunch, sent a tweet reading: 'I hope they cut off your dumb f**king head you dumb Muslim lover b***h.'

Journalist Annabell Crabb was called a 'Orwellian s**t and dead soul c**t', in one of the tweets sent to her. 

Mamamia's post says the video is 'not to be laughed off'. 

'In Australia, more than one in three women have experienced some form of violence since the age of 15,' the article reads.

'Ninety percent of those cases will be perpetrated by men. On average 1.5 women die each week at the hands of their partners.

'So when we see women who are bold enough to have their say in public receive threats of violence and sexual abuse, we do really have to take this seriously.' 

Mamamia, who filmed and posted the video, said the sort of insults dished out are 'not to be laughed off'

'In Australia, more than one in three women have experienced some form of violence since the age of 15,' the article reads

'Ninety percent of those cases will be perpetrated by men. On average 1.5 women die each week at the hands of their partners

The original video, published last week, shows Lisa Wilkinson, Tracey Spicer, Sarah Harris, Mia Freedman, Rosie Waterland and Sam Frost reading out the varying degrees of gender abuse they are objected to on a daily basis.

The most disturbing was a tweet sent to journalist Tracey Spicer, which she was filmed reading out calmly as she sat in her car.

Journalist Tracey Spicer was among six Australian television personalities to read out the harsh and violent comments they are subjected to on social media every day

'I hope your children are raped and killed, you silly c**t,' it read. 

While many tweets and social media posts were physically threatening, the women were just as easily subjected to personal attacks on appearance.

'You obviously don't shave your bush, cause it's hidden under your massive gut,' writer Rosie Waterland copped. 

Today host Lisa Wilkinson read out various tweets for an online video by Mamamia showcasing social media users attacking her physical appearance 

The Bachelor's Sam Frost was told: 'I love Sam like I love my sister. Bear in mind I ate my sister in the womb'.

Studio 10 host Sarah Harris, who was also featured in the video, told her program on Thursday she received a 'disgusting tweet' a few days ago from a man threatening to rape and murder her. 

'I sent it to Twitter and said can we report this guy and they said it doesn't breach our guidelines,' she said.

'I don't feel that he would follow through, but that's not okay. You shouldn't be able to post that crap online.'

The person behind the video, Mamamia editor Kate Leaver, told Daily Mail Australia a lot of people wouldn't be aware these women are being targeted with verbal abuse on a daily basis.

'I just want as many people as possible to understand why this kind of abuse - rape threats, sexually charged threats, death threats - happens,' she said. 

'That type of language is what creates a society where violence against women is acceptable.

'Usually the conversations is about how to deal with it - like blocking people on Twitter. We want to start the conversation earlier than that and understand why it happens.' 

Writer Rosie Waterland was attacked over her physical appearance, something all six women are trying to showcase in the online video 

Mamamia's Mia Freedman read out her tweet calmly with a blank expression for the cameras

Ms Leaver said the abuse was gender specific because women who put an opinion out there were subjected to personal attacks, whereas men were often just attacked on their idea.

'Shockingly it comes at you from all angles. We have another two videos to come out with another bunch of high profile women. Everyone we speak to says they get it on a daily basis,' she said.

Studio 10 host Sarah Harris hit out saying gender abuse on social media was not okay and people shouldn't be 'able to post that crap online'

During an appearance on Studio 10 on Thursday, Ms Leaver said it was extremely difficult to get social media sites to take notice of abuse.

'CEO of Twitter came out recently and his longer statement essentially was "we really suck at dealing with abuse on Twitter and we're sorry",' she said.

'It's so hard. You don't have to authenticate your identity, you could create accounts in 100 different names and stay at home attacking people all day long.'
