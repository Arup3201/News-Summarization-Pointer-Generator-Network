England will have Dave Attwood in their team to face New Zealand after his first child was born on Tuesday.

The Bath lock was released early from training to be at his fiancee Bridget’s side after she went into labour. She was due to give birth last Friday and it was thought Attwood, 27, may miss the match at Twickenham if the baby was born this weekend.

Bath lock Attwood is expected to be named in Stuart Lancaster's starting XV on Thursday

But Attwood on Tuesday night confirmed on Twitter that the baby had been delivered, posting: ‘Massive thanks from everyone. @briewhelan was a superstar. ‘Everyone is doing amazingly well. Couldn’t be happier.’

Attwood will now partner Courtney Lawes against the All Blacks with uncapped Saracens lock George Kruis, who filled in for Attwood during training, offering cover from the bench.

He has been named in Stuart Lancaster’s 23-man squad so should make his debut from the bench, as should Anthony Watson, chosen ahead of Alex Goode, Marland Yarde and Jack Nowell.

Wings Yarde and Nowell have been troubled by minor injuries since coming into camp.

Kieran Brookes has been preferred to Henry Thomas as the replacement tighthead prop, despite spending most of his time at loosehead for Newcastle this season.

And England’s coaches have opted for a second No 8, Ben Morgan, instead of James Haskell or Calum Clark as their back-row substitute.
