A primary school has transformed its pupils’ achievement after introducing a compulsory nine-hour day.

Older children at Great Yarmouth Primary Academy are required to start at 8.55am and stay until 6pm to take part in a free programme of activities and complete homework under supervision.

The school – previously one of the worst-performing in the country – introduced the 45-hour week to give pupils the same opportunities as those from private schools and wealthy backgrounds.

In a dramatic turnaround in less than two years, it has now earned a ‘good’ rating by Ofsted – the second-highest.

The watchdog highlighted the extended day as a key factor in the school’s success, praising its ‘outstanding leadership’ and remarking that the timetable was improving pupils’ life skills and commitment to education.

In its former incarnation as Greenacre Primary, the Norfolk school was among the bottom 200 performers out of 15,000 nationally and was condemned by inspectors as failing in 2010.

The extended week was introduced in 2012 as the school became an academy sponsored by millionaire businessman Theodore Agnew.

Under the controversial timetable – longer than a standard working week – school starts at 8.55am, although pupils are free to attend a breakfast club from 7.45am.

Lessons finish at 3.30pm but those aged seven to 11 stay until 5pm for activities including horse-riding, cookery, cello lessons, first aid, dance and trips to Cambridge University.

Long day: The extended timetable at the primary school applied to all pupils over the age of nine

Those aged nine to 11, the final two years of school, then spend a further hour on homework or reading under supervision. Education Secretary Michael Gove supports longer school days, but many in education oppose the idea.

Dr Tim Hands, chairman of the Headmasters’ and Headmistresses’ Conference, which represents leading independent schools, says it undermines a ‘proper childhood’.

But Bill Holledge, head of Great Yarmouth, said: ‘This is certainly not some Gradgrindian regime. Pupils are happy and engaged and bounce out of school at the end of the day.’

The extended timetable is funded partly through the pupil premium, and donations from Mr Agnew.

Mr Agnew, who has been touted as a possible successor to Baroness (Sally) Morgan as chairman of Ofsted, said: ‘I am determined to end the apartheid in education so commonplace in this country.’

The longer day initially was controversial among parents who were concerned it would eat into family time and exhaust pupils. But Mr Holledge said: ‘Parents have been convinced by the views of their children.’

Education Minister Elizabeth Truss praised the school’s transformation as a ‘brilliant example’.
