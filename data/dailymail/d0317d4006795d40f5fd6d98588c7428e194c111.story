Tragic accident: Demetri Phillips, 12, was accidentally shot and killed by a friend while they played with a gun in University City, Missouri on Tuesday

The bedroom door was unlocked and the gun had no safety catch.

Police said that it was likely the boy knew where his grandfather kept the gun as he was being raised by him and lived at the house.

Police are now investigating and it is unclear whether charges will be brought against the grandfather.

A four-year-old boy accidentally shot himself in the foot after he found a gun at his family home, police said.

The child, who has not been identified, injured himself on Tuesday night and was taken to hospital in Houston, Texas. The boy is in critical condition.

The child was at home with his parents when the shooting happened. He had climbed on top of a chest in the bedroom and found the gun.

After hearing the gunshot, his parents found him lying on the bed and dialed 911. No charges have so far been brought.

The boy who fired the gun has not been identified and is currently being held in a juvenile detention center.

The case is being treated as an accidental shooting, police said.

Demetri was in the sixth grade at  Brittany Woods Middle School in University City and was in the same class as the friend who shot him.

School spokeswoman Shantana T. Stewart told the St Louis-Post Dispatch: 'Demetri had a really good sense of humor.

'He was creative and came up with stories full of adventure.'

A neighbor said that after he heard the shot being fired, he saw the boy come out of the garage with his cellphone in his hand and he was calling the police.

Demetri's body was lying on the porch behind the garage at the suburban home.
