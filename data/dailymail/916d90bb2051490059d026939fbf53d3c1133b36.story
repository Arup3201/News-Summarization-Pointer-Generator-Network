A teenage thug who stabbed a partygoer - then urged a gang of friends to kick and stamp on him as he lay dying - has been jailed for a minimum of 15 years.

Jimmy Connors, 17, was high on cocaine when he plunged a kitchen knife into Joe Walker, 23, outside a party in Sheffield, South Yorkshire.

Connors led a pack of 12 who chased Mr Walker onto grassland, plunged a knife into his back and then stood back while the thugs repeatedly kicked and stamped him.

Apparently pleased with his work, Connors walked away 'elated, happy and proud' of what he had done.

He was found guilty of murder after a trial and today jailed for a minimum of 15 years at Sheffield Crown Court.

Mr Justice John Griffith Williams said: 'Although you were only just 17-years-old when you murdered Joe Walker, I am satisfied that your reputation was such that people were frightened of you.

'And it is not surprising that people were frightened of you because you went out that night armed with a knife which you were clearly prepared to use.'

The court heard Joe Walker (above) had been defending his friend who was punched and racially abused before Connors and the gang turned on him

The court previously heard that Mr Walker, of Sheffield, had been at a party in the city last September along with his friend Dennis Patterson.

The trouble began when Mr Patterson went outside for a cigarette, the court heard.

Mr Patterson told jurors he was attacked by a man outside the house after he was subjected to abuse from the other side of the road.

The unprovoked attack left him with a broken nose and he went back into the house bleeding.

Jade West, also at the party, said she 
heard the argument from an upstairs bedroom and testified that Mr 
Patterson had racist abuse hurled at him.

The gang of thugs led by Connors chased Mr Walker to grassland nearby and pinned his arms back before knifing him

Ms West told the court she told Mr Walker about the attack, who replied he 'wasn't having people hitting his friend' and rushed outside to defend him.

Mr Patterson said: 'Connors was shouting abuse at Joe, effing and blinding, and Joe ended up hitting him once. It knocked him back.

'The defendant then pulled a blade out from his trousers. It was a big kitchen knife, about eight inches.'

Mr Walker was then chased by Connors and his gang down a pathway into a grassy area near the house, where the stabbing happened.

Ms West said she saw Mr Walker's arms being held back, and she screamed for help.

After Mr Walker was knifed she said she heard the defendant tell him: ‘You’re not going to do nowt now you’re laid out’.

'I saw Joe staggering and holding his side,' she said.

'His eyes were flickering. I didn’t know what was happening at first. He didn’t look like Joe at all.'

Mr Walker died from massive internal bleeding soon after the attack

'I was shouting for help. My phone battery was dead so I couldn’t ring an ambulance. That’s when someone came down and tried to give him mouth-to-mouth and she rang an ambulance.'

The blade had severed an artery, causing severe internal bleeding, and Mr Walker died a short time later from his injuries.

Mr Justice Griffith Williams said he was satisfied on the evidence that Joe Walker was not the sort of person to use 'gratuitous' violence.

He said: 'Joe Walker must have been very frightened indeed [when you chased after him].

'When you caught up with you stabbed him in the back, and not content with that you stood there when the others attacked him.

'Your immediate reaction was to boast about what you had done.'

The judge lifted a reporting restriction banning the media from identifying the killer, who it emerged first started appearing before the courts when he was aged just 12.

Jurors heard that the year before the fatal knife attack, Connors was handed a youth rehabilitation order for carrying an offensive weapon, an extendable baton, in a public place.

Other previous convictions include burglary, car theft, possession of cannabis and theft from vehicles.

In a statement, Mr Walker's parents Patrick Walker and Karen Foulstone, said: 'Nothing will ever take away the pain and heartache we feel, nor will it bring back our son.

'People need to think twice about carrying and using knives. It only shows their weaknesses.

'We are still numb from Joe’s death. Our lives have been turned upside down and the loss of Joe is difficult to describe.

'At home there is silence no laughing or joking - just tears and photographs of happier times.'
