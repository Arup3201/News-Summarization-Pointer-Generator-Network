Chelsea are due to open talks with Mexican side Pachuca over 21-year-old winger Jurgen Damm.

Damm holds a dual German-Mexican passport and had a trial at Manchester United last year.

Andres Fassi, the club's vice-president, said: 'Chelsea are the club interested, but we
 have to see how much they are interested, we can't go ahead of 
ourselves, we have to wait and see.

'When it comes to us, it's a matter 
of sporting project. We want him to stay and we will see how much 
Chelsea are interested.

'There is a belief they arrive in Mexico on Thursday to talk with us,' he told Medio Tiempo.

'In principle we have a sporting plan 
for Jurgen and we hope he stays, but if something comes up from abroad, 
we have to take it into account and if it's serious, we have to respond,
 we will have news in the next 48 hours.'
