A Canadian automobile executive imprisoned in Cuba on corruption charges for more than three years was released today - only five months into the 15-year jail sentence he was given in September.

Cy Tokmakjian, 74, had his case ended by Cuba's government who called it a demonstration of the fight against bribery, and critics said it was a warning against doing business in the country.

The executive, who is owner of Ontario-based  Tokmakjian Group, was serving jail time after his arrest in a 2011 anti-graft drive that swept up Cuban officials and foreign business executives from at least five nations.

'Cy returns home in good health, fantastic spirits, and is looking forward to spending time with his family which includes three loving children and seven excited grandchildren,' said his lawyer Barry Papazian. 

The case was seen by some as a loose end in the US/Cuba deal late last year that led to the release of three Cuban intelligence agents in exchange for US contractor Alan Gross and CIA spy Rolando Sarraff Trujillo.

Canada and the Vatican hosted key talks during in 18 months of negotiations leading up to the exchange, which was accompanied by a joint move to restore full diplomatic relations between the countries.

It was not revealed by Canadian officials on whether the deal boosted their efforts to win freedom for Tokmakjian, and no immediate reason was given for his sudden release.

The company statement made no mention of two Canadian aides from the Tokmakjian Group who were also convicted and sentenced to 12 and eight years. 

They had been under house arrest throughout the trial and while their convictions were being appealed. 

Fourteen Cubans were also convicted and sentenced to terms ranging from six to 20 years in a case that strained Cuba's relations with Canada, a major trading partner, and which could deter foreigners from investing with the communist government. 

His family said his prosecution was an excuse to seize his Ontario-based Tokmakjian Group's $100 million in assets in Cuba. 

Tokmakjian's case ended by Cuba's government who called it a demonstration of the fight against bribery, and critics said it was a warning against doing business in the country (above local residents in Old Havana, Cuba)

Some potential investors in Cuba said the case made them wary of Cuba's drive to draw billions in new foreign investment. 

Foreign business people have long considered payoffs ranging from a free meal to cash deposits in overseas accounts to be an unavoidable cost of doing business in Cuba. 

They have skeptically greeted government assertions that rooting out rampant corruption is among the country's highest priorities.
