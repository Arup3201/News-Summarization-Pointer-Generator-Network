The test opener of the Bledisloe Cup left Wallabies star Israel Folau red-faced and bleeding, but it was not from chasing down the opposition.

The full-back came off second best after an embarrassing clash with teammate Nic White, and walked away clutching his nose as blood gushed down his face at ANZ Stadium in Sydney on Saturday.

But after a quick spritz from his water bottle and a dab of a tissue, Folau was back on the field and minutes later he had another run-in - this time with a referee, which left both of them on their backs.

It was a slow start for the Wallabies who failed to gain traction and finished the first-half six points down against the All Blacks who had garnered nine points.

But when the final siren went, the home side again denied the Kiwis a record 18th consecutive test win, ending the game on a draw with 12 points a piece.

Two years ago, an 18-18 draw in Brisbane prevented the All Blacks matching the 18 straight wins by New Zealand from 1965-69 and South Africa's 1997-98 outfit - and the first tryless Test in Sydney since 1979 denied the Kiwis again on Saturday night.

Wallabies five-eighth Kurtley Beale and All Blacks opposite Aaron Cruden both landed four penalty goals in a wet and sloppy - but ultimately gripping - match at ANZ Stadium.

South African Jaco Peyper's pedantic and, at times, bemusing refereeing reduced the much-anticipated trans-Tasman showdown to a dour, stop-start affair in front of a 68,627 fans.

The two rivals are set to meet again on August 23 at Auckland's Eden Park.
