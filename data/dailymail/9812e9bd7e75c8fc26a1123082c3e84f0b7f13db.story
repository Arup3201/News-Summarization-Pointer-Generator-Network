A Scout leader who was found with boys' underwear under his bed and a cache of child pornography has walked free from court with just a community order after a judge said it was the best way to protect him from the public.

Eliot Easterby, a former parish councillor and the author of 'teenage' books, had hundreds of indecent images of underage boys stored in a hard drive and three memory sticks at his house. 

The 44-year-old from Hamble, Hampshire, also had a collection of child pornography DVDs showing young boys in paddling pools and a hidden stash of underwear left behind when he took young boys in Scouts trips.

Eliot Easterby, 44, was convicted of a string of child pornography offences after police discovered more than 600 indecent images and a haul of boys' underwear at his home in Hamble, Hampshire 

Following a major international operation which involved Canadian police Easterby was charged with a number of offences including the making of and possession of child pornography. 

Despite being convicted of 13 charges relating to boys aged eight to 15 he walked free from court with a community order. 

Sentencing at Southampton Crown Court, where jurors took less than an hour to convict Easterby of the charges brought against him, Judge Peter Henry said he felt it was the best way to both punish the man and protect the public from him.

During an investigation which began with a tip off from Canadian police, officers discovered more than 600 indecent images at Easterby's home. 

Around 300 had been viewed and deleted with another 374 downloaded and stored on memory sticks and a hard drive. 

A stash of child pornography was also found. Easterby, who denied all the charges, claimed the images were not of an indecent nature, a claim Judge Henry later rejected. 

'You say you have no sexual attraction to boys. That is a matter of some concern because all the images of the boys linger on the area of genitalia,' he said. 

'These boys are victims, filmed for the sexual gratification of you and others. 

'It is not a victimless crime.' 

But with no evidence Easterby had had any sexual contact with the children he was spared jail. 

Instead he was sentenced to a community order, the 'best way' of punishing him and protecting the public, the judge added. 

He was given a ten year prevention order restricting his use of the internet and was banned from having contact with boys aged under 16 without their parents or guardians' permission. 

He was also placed on the sex offenders register for seven years and ordered to attend a sex offender treatment course. 

Easterby has written several books aimed at teenagers based on the ghosthunting adventures of two adolescent boys.

He also taught at Sholing Technology College in Southampton. Another teacher from the college last month admitted owning child and animal porn. 

Jurors took just one hour to convict Easterby of 13 charges relating to child pornography at Southampton Crown Court (above)
