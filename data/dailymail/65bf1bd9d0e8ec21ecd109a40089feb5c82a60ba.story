Tragic: Daniel Spargo-Mabbs, 16, suffered three 
heart attacks after downing half a gram of MDMA powder in water at a 
rave in Hayes, west London

The parents of a schoolboy who died after taking ecstasy are determined that other young people learn about the danger of drugs from his tragic death.

Daniel Spargo-Mabbs, 16, suffered three heart attacks after downing half a gram of MDMA powder in water at a rave in Hayes, west London, in January this year.

Over the next three days his heart-broken parents Tim and Fiona Spargo-Mabbs had to watch him slowly die, as the drug caused his vital organs to stop functioning.

Now they have set up a charitable foundation in his memory to educate young people about the danger of drugs.

They are also raising funds to produce a play for schools about his death.

Daniel’s Oxford University-educated mother, Fiona, said: 'Daniel was funny, good company - he was cheeky, intelligent and curious about the world.

'He had a zest for life and to learn about the unknown. He was loved by so many people from all sorts of groups, he knew how to engage people.

'All through that day he was vacillating about whether to go to the rave, with a group of boys he did not know very well, or to come home to his mum.

'If he had come home he would still be here today.

'We really miss him. His death has left a gaping hole, not just in our lives but in the fabric of society.

'We’re slowly trying to rebuild our lives into whatever our "new normal" will be, but we’ve barely begun and have a long road ahead of us.'

However, the couple are determined to make something positive come from his death and have set up the Daniel Spargo-Mabbs Foundation, which is working with parents, teachers and students to warn about the dangers of drugs.

The foundation is campaigning to have drug awareness classes in schools, rather than one-off lessons, and to help students learn exactly what different drugs will do to them and what the warning signs are.

Mrs Spargo-Mabbs, who works as a manager in adult education for Croydon Council, said: 'We need to educate young people about the consequences of taking drugs - that you never know what is in the drug you are going to take and what it will do to you.

Ryan Kirk, 21, from Beckenham, South London, was charged with being concerned in supplying a controlled drug of class A - MDMA to Daniel (pictured) but has been cleared by a jury

'Teenagers listen to their parents, 
peers and teachers and we hope to engage them to spread the message 
about the dangers of drugs.

'Had
 Daniel lived he would have suffered brain damage and had his legs 
amputated - people think if you take drugs you die or have a great 
night, but there’s so much in between.

'We’re
 working with playwright Mark Wheeller to produce a play about Daniel’s 
death. We hope it will be performed in schools to help young people 
engage with the issues and put themselves in the heads of the different 
people.

Grief: Mrs Spargo-Mabbs is calling for young people to be better educated about drugs

'We want something 
positive to come out of Daniel’s death. Someone else has died after 
taking the drug since Daniel’s death and young people will keep dying as
 long as they keep taking drugs.

'If someone reads about Daniel’s death and decided not to take drugs, that will be a positive thing.'

Daniel’s
 family opened their hearts after 21-year-old Ryan Kirk was found not 
guilty last week of supplying the drugs that killed their son following a
 trial at Isleworth Crown Court.

Nicqueel Pitrora, 18, has previously pleaded guilty to selling the drugs to Daniel and his friends.

Pitrora is in custody, awaiting sentencing.

Mrs Spargo-Mabbs said: 'Justice has been done and the process which led to Ryan Kirk’s acquittal was fair.

'Obviously
 someone sold the drugs to Daniel’s friends on that night. One man, 
Nicqueel Pitrora, has pleaded guilty to providing drugs.

'Another
 man, who supplied the drugs, is still out there. I hope that man thinks
 seriously about what he has done and realises there are better things 
to do with his life other than selling drugs and destroying his own and 
other people’s futures.

'The verdict was not the most important thing for us. We have lost our son and nothing is going to bring him back.

'We
 do not hate the people who did this to him, we have prayed for them. We
 decided there are better things for us to do than carry around the 
burden of hate and anger.'

Daniel’s
 parents took part in a fundraising cycle raid from their home in 
Croydon, south London, to Brighton at the weekend to raise cash for the 
Foundation.

Mrs Spargo-Mabbs
 said: 'The cycle ride was fantastic and the best possible antidote to 
all the horribleness of the last week in court - doing something 
amazingly positive, surrounded by people who care deeply about Dan’s 
death, and about us, and hopefully raising funds to stop any other 
family having to go through what we have been since January.

'Tim did the ride on Dan’s bike, which he’s been using all season in Dan’s memory, and wearing his shorts.

'The group has been riding all season in support of the Foundation, and has now cycled a total of 5,262 miles.

'We’re
 hoping to be able to raise the £4,800 we need to fund the Mark Wheeller
 play commission, which is going to be such an exciting and powerful 
project.'
