United Airlines is getting its 787 Dreamliners back in the air after the state-of-the-art aircraft was kept from flying because of a flaw in its lithium batteries.

The planes were grounded for four months by the Federal Aviation Authority because of smoldering batteries on 787s owned by other airlines, the first time since 1979 that every plane of a particular type was ordered to stay out of the air for safety reasons

The incidents included an emergency landing of one plane, and a fire on another.

The malfunctions never caused any serious injuries but the January grounding embarrassed Boeing, which makes the 787, and disrupted schedules at the eight airlines that were flying the planes.

The company had delivered 50 of the planes worldwide.The grounding forced United to delay planned international flights and hurt its first-quarter earnings by $11million.

Others, including Japan Airlines and South America's LATAM Airlines Group, also said profits were reduced. LATAM said it still had to make payments on the plane and pay for crews and maintenance. It expects to resume flying soon.

United's first 787 flight is scheduled for 11am EDT today and will fly from Houston to Chicago.

Passengers didn't appear to be too worried, according to United spokeswoman Christen David. 'We saw strong demand for the flight from the first weekend it opened for sale,' he said.

United is planning to use 787s on shorter domestic flights before resuming international flights on June 10 with new Denver-to-Tokyo service as well as temporary Houston-to-London flights. It's adding flights to Tokyo, Shanghai, and Lagos, Nigeria, in August.

Those long international flights are the main reason the 787 exists. Its medium size and fuel efficiency are a good fit for long routes. Starting with shorter domestic flights 'will give us a period to ramp up full 787 operations,' David said.

United was the first U.S. airline to get the 787 and now has six. United has said it expects to have four fixed by Monday, with the other two getting their batteries modified in coming days.

The 787 uses more electricity than any other jet and it makes more use of lithium-ion batteries because it needs to be able to provide power for things like flight controls and a backup generator when its engines are shut down. Each 787 has two of the batteries.

Boeing never did figure out the cause of the battery incidents because of the fire damage. Instead, it redesigned the battery and its charger.

The idea was to eliminate all of the possible causes, 787 chief engineer Mike Sinnett said in an online chat on Thursday where he and a Boeing test pilot took questions about the plane.

The changes include more heat insulation between each cell and charging the battery to a lower maximum voltage.
