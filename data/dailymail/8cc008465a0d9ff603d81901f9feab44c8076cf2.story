Graziano Pelle has been recovering from his heroics for Italy in the best possible way - by snuggling up with glamourous girlfriend Viky Varga.

The Southampton striker netted the only goal  on his international debut on Sunday as Antonio Conte's side scraped past Malta 1-0 in their Euro 2016 qualifier.

And Hungarian model Varga, who congratulated her partner on his winning goal on Instagram, posted another snap of the two in an embrace, with the message: 'Distance means so little when someone means so much.'

Graziano Pelle has made a brilliant start to life in England, scoring six times in 10 appearances for club and country since leaving Feynoord:

v Millwall (Capital One Cup)

v West Ham (Premier League)

v Newcastle x2 (Premier League)

v QPR (Premier League)

v Malta (Euro 2016 qualifiers) 

The striker has hit the ground running at Southampton, netting four goals in six Premier League games for Ronald Koeman's high-flyers.

The Italian press hailed their new hero, with the Saints star dominating the front pages alongside criticism of the rest of the team.

La Gazzetta dello Sport claimed 'Pelle is there, Italy aren't', while Corriere dello Sport says it was 'Pelle, and that's it' for Italy.

Even Liverpool striker Mario Balotelli congratulated the man who was picked ahead of him, posting a picture to his Instagram with the message 'Well done Italy! Very well done Pelle, keep it up!'

He will be back in action in the red and white of Southampton at St Mary's on Saturday, looking to add to his goal tally for the season against Sunderland.
