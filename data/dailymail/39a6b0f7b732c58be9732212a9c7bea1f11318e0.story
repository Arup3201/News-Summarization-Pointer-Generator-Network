A butcher whose countryside estate began running short of rabbits started selling squirrel - and the meat has proved so popular it sold out in three hours.

Elveden Estate butchers in Suffolk is restricted to the numbers of rabbits it can shoot every month due to plummeting numbers and added the unusual delicacy to its menu in a bid to replace stocks. 

The free range squirrel is white in texture and is said to have a similar taste to rabbit while being low in fat. 

Elveden Estate butchers in Suffolk have added squirrel to their menu after their levels of rabbit starting running low. The unusual delicacy became so popular with customers it sold out in three hours

James Holliday, forestry and conservation manager at the estate, said: 'Rabbits are no longer breeding 'like rabbits'.

'Nationally, numbers have been in decline over the past few years and have now reached such low numbers we are limiting the number killed in order to maintain a sustainable population.

'The population had been decreasing since the 1950s and it has become increasingly important for us to conserve as many rabbits as possible.

'We have been catching the squirrels for a while now but obviously the reduction of rabbits made us think we could use them as a substitute and it has done very well.'

The meat is being used in a variety of recipes by the estates customers, including a squirrel pasty (pictured)

Richard Howard, food shop manager at the estate, said squirrel meat could be a healthy addition to diets.

He said: 'Squirrel from Elveden is wild, nutritious and has virtually zero food miles, coming straight from the estate itself, making for a highly ethical mix.'
