Sportsmail's Tuesday columnist puts his neck on the line in forecasting what he believes will happen in a season that could prove to be the most intriguing Premier League campaign yet, as well as predicting outcomes in the Champions League and La Liga plus England's fortunes in the Euro 2016 qualifiers.

Gareth Bale will score 30-plus goals - providing he stays fit. The confidence he has built up in the past 12 months at Real Madrid and the physical power he can now add to his talents will see him take his game to another level.

The players around will help of course, but it wouldn’t surprise me if Real Madrid won both the Champions League and La Liga, with Bale taking centre stage. The Welshman netted 15 times last season; double it and more this year.

Wayne Rooney will have his best ever season at Manchester United. I’m not just talking about the amount of goals he will score, I’m talking about his all-round game. He will score and create, and he will flourish under a world class manager who believes in him. Show us what you can do, Wayne.

Time to shine! Wayne Rooney should flourish in a Manchester United shirt under new boss Louis van Gaal

Knows where the net is! Rooney looks like to pile in with goals and assists at Old Trafford this season

Luis Suarez will get sent off at least twice. He will be a marked man, referees will be watching closely – nobody will want to be the man in the middle who misses the fourth bite - and opponents in Spain will be as masterful of the dark arts of football as Suarez is. He’s got off lightly in England – this won’t happen in a Barcelona shirt.

.......................................................................... 

Manchester City will win nothing. With the squad they had, and the changes at other clubs, City should have won the title by 10-12 points last season, but in the end only clinched it because Chelsea dropped points late in the campaign against Villa, Palace, Norwich and Sunderland, while Liverpool lost to Chelsea and slipped up at Crystal Palace.

Manuel Pellegrini gets his sides playing decent football, but that can only take you so far. On Sunday he changed nothing when Arsenal were outplaying the champions from the first minute. 

The unhappiness of Yaya Toure this summer has smacked of everything that was wrong with the latter part of the Roberto Mancini era at the Etihad. And his handling of the goalkeeper situation is nothing short of bizarre. 

I’ll be fascinated to see who is in between the sticks for City on the opening weekend, but I know that whoever misses out won’t be happy. 

Joe Hart doesn’t deserve to be dropped; Willy Caballero will wonder why he’s been signed after playing every minute of every game in La Liga last season.

QPR will be a joy to watch. When Harry Redknapp arrived at Rangers the dressing room was in an appalling state. Last season he worked with a backdrop of financial pressure to get promoted. He may not have done it in style, but Redknapp took QPR back to the top flight. 

Now with the pressure off, Glenn Hoddle on the staff and with most of the high-earning wasters away from the club, Redknapp can get QPR playing similarly to Spurs when they were ripping teams to shreds in the Champions League. Results may not always go their way, but Rangers should be good value this season.

All smiles: Luis Suarez completed a £75million move from Liverpool to Barcelona after the World Cup

Tougher time: The defenders in La Liga should be more adept at playing the striker at his own game

Will we see this again? Manchester City are going to struggle to retain their Premier League crown 

Resolved? Yaya Toure's unhappiness at the Etihad Stadium will be a growing concern for those at the club

Trepidation: Manuel Pellegrini has his side playing good football but they appear to have gone backwards

Awful: City were completely outplayed by Arsenal at Wembley in the Community Shield on Sunday

Gliding: Shaun Wright-Phillips moves beyond Stelios Kitsiou in QPR's friendly against PAOK on Saturday

England will lose to Switzerland next month in their opening Euro 2016 qualifier. I have no doubts they will qualify, but England have lost their captain at a time when leadership is needed.

I’m sure Steven Gerrard will have his own regrets about his international career, but he’s been excellent in qualifiers and will be missed. Some of the England squad think the World Cup was positive for England, so I wonder how much time they’ve actually spent thinking about how they could have done better for their country.

For me, off the back of a record-breakingly bad World Cup, and against a Switzerland side who impressed me in Brazil, I can only see England losing. I’ve booked time off and paid for my tickets so it won’t stop me going to the game to support my country, but I just can’t help thinking we will slip up. The question then will focus on Roy Hodgson’s future.

Bad to worse: England were humiliated at the World Cup but could struggle against Switzerland too 

Chelsea will win the title. If they don’t then Jose Mourinho has really lost his powers. He’s been allowed to sign two talismanic players in Diego Costa and Cesc Fabregas, to fill two key roles in the team. Chelsea should have won it last season, this time around there are no excuses. 

So far in his career Mourinho has proved he is a more successful manager than Pellegrini, so with the squad the Portuguese has the title should be heading to Stamford Bridge.

Big year: Jose Mourinho should deliver the Premier League title with the players at his disposal 

Like the kid who stayed in uniform and watched from the sidelines while the rest of us took part in school sports day, Tottenham Hotspur will once again be admiring the successful sides next season. I respect what Mauricio Pochettino did at Southampton – they were good to watch. And if he is given time he may do something decent at White Hart Lane. But I’ll be amazed if it’s this season.

There is a lot of work to do at Spurs and I’m shocked Pochettino hasn’t gone back to Saints for some players. Dejan Lovren and Adam Lallana are two who would surely have improved Tottenham. He’s a miracle worker if he takes them into the top four.

Pochettino wasted a golden opportunity in the FA Cup with Southampton last season by fielding a weakened side and losing at Sunderland in the fifth round, so if he takes that philosophy to Tottenham they won’t be doing anything in the cups this season. In the short-term it will be same old Spurs. But beyond that, if they stick with Pochettino, it could be fruitful.

Job on his hands: Mauricio Pochettino will find life tough as Tottenham manager in his first season

Swansea will be going down. It will be one of the Premier League’s real special achievements if Garry Monk keeps them up. They ended last season winning three of their final four games. 

Before that they enjoyed just one victory in 12. Losing one key player this summer was a blow. Losing two was careless. Losing three could be disastrous. Michu, Ben Davies, Michel Vorm, Chico Flores, Jonathan de Guzman have led the exodus. 

They have been big players for the Swans and they will all be missed. If Wilfried Bony also leaves, Monk won’t have a prayer.

Big miss: Michu has left Swansea City for a season-long loan spell at Serie A side Napoli

Tricky time ahead: Garry Monk will know he faces a battle to keep the Swans in the top flight

Louis van Gaal will have his fair share of touchline spats. He’s a guy with a sense of humour but in the heat of the battle he could’ve fallen out with Mother Theresa. Most likely to wind up the Dutchman are Alan Pardew, Arsene Wenger and Mourinho. Sit back and enjoy!

Demeanour: Louis van Gaal (right, sat next to Ryan Giggs) likes to express himself on the touchline
