The Obama administration on Tuesday sought dismissal of a lawsuit by the businesswoman whose complaint to the FBI led to General David Petraeus' ouster as CIA director.

If a federal judge allows the lawsuit by Jill Kelley to proceed, the case could delve into the roles played in the Petraeus scandal by the FBI, the Pentagon and other parts of the Obama administration.

Kelley wants to find out who in the U.S. government leaked her name and some of her emails to the media amid the uproar over Petraeus' affair with Paula Broadwell, author of a biography on Petraeus called All In.

Jill Kelley, right, and her husband Scott Kelley, left, are seeking an apology and financial compensation from the government for allegedly leaking her name in the scandal that brought down Gen. David Petraeus

The leaks placed the socialite in 
the middle of an avalanche of unfavorable publicity and as a result, she
shouldered the blame as the villain in the downfall of Petraeus and 
General John Allen, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, the lawsuit 
states.

The suit claims the leaks violated 
the Privacy Act, which was enacted in 1974 after revelations of illegal 
surveillance by federal agencies in the Watergate scandal.

The law seeks to protect individuals 
from unwarranted invasions of privacy by federal agencies that maintain 
sensitive information about them.

The Justice Department said in a 
court filing that Kelley has failed to present any facts suggesting that
the FBI and the Pentagon flagrantly disregarded her privacy rights.

'A bare allegation' that information 
was retrieved from government files is insufficient to sustain a claim 
that the government engaged in an unlawful disclosure about Kelley, the 
Justice Department said.

The FBI and the Pentagon have 
exempted several of their record systems from the requirements of the 
Privacy Act and Kelley and her husband, who also is a plaintiff in the 
case, fail to say whether the leaked information was in a system of 
records that was subject to the Privacy Act's requirements, the court 
filing states.

Allegations: The suit says the FBI did not provide Kelley the security protection a victim is entitled to because the bureau wanted to avoid attention before the upcoming presidential election

The Justice Department does not deny 
the government leaked adverse information about the Kelleys, or that the
Kelleys were damaged, one of their lawyers, Alan Raul, said Tuesday 
night.

Rather, the Justice Department relies
on the supposed fact that the FBI and Defense Department have opted 
their records out of Privacy Act protections, said Raul.

In an act that triggered the criminal
probe resulting in Petraeus' forced resignation, Kelley told the FBI 
she and several U.S. top military officers had been the recipients of 
anonymous harassing emails.

Kelley and her husband 'sought to do the right thing by reporting the facts' to the FBI, the lawsuit alleges.

But 'rather than protect the Kelleys'
privacy interests as the law and their duty required, defendants 
instead willfully and maliciously thrust the Kelleys into the maw of 
public scrutiny concerning one of the most widely reported sex scandals 
to rock the United States government'.

Some of the anonymous emails ultimately traced to Broadwell were sent to Allen.

The messages included notes on the general's plans to see Kelley in Washington the following week.

Allen was concerned about how anyone else would know about his personal plans.

One email mentioned Petraeus and an 
upcoming social event and military and intelligence meeting with NATO 
leaders in Washington.

The emails to the generals claimed Kelley was up to no good and impugned her motives for befriending the military leaders.

The lawsuit says the U.S. government 
'unforgivably transformed Mrs Kelley's reputation from that of a 
respected business and community leader'.

According to the lawsuit, the FBI 
Washington cyber division and FBI Deputy Director Sean Joyce directed 
agents in the Tampa Field office to treat the Kelleys' case differently 
than normal criminal investigations.

For example, the suit says, the FBI 
did not provide Kelley with security protection to which a victim is 
entitled because the bureau wanted to avoid attention before the 
upcoming presidential election.

The lawsuit also says the FBI in 
Washington directed investigating agents not to proceed with a scheduled
effort to interview Broadwell once the agents had determined she was 
the stalker.

Government officials violated the 
Constitution's ban on unreasonable searches in its review of Kelley's 
emails, the suit claims.

It alleges they have suffered 
financial losses because of the government's actions. They are seeking 
monetary damages and an apology, among other things.

In the fallout from the scandal, Kelley was stripped of her role as a honorary consul for South Korea.

She was forced to return her vanity car registration plates and banned from MacDill Airforce Base.
