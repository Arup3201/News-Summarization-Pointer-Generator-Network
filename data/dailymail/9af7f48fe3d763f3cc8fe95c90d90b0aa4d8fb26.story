The British Chiropractic Association claims hunching over a screen can damage posture and cause back or neck pain

Watching movies in bed on your laptop or tablet is playing havoc with the nation's backs, a new study warned.

Nearly half of all Britons confessed they used the devices before dropping off to sleep.

Yet the British Chiropractic Association (BCA) said people tend to forget their posture, hunch over the screen with their spine unsupported which can damage posture and cause back or neck pain.

Three fifths also watch TV in bed and four fifths of those spend up to four hours glued to the screen.

But the BCA warned much of this TV time is at uncomfortable body angles.

Instead it is urging Britons to make bedrooms tech free zones to improve sleep quality and better posture.

BCA chiropractor, Tim Hutchful, said: 'Technology has become integral to our lives but when it comes to bedtime it is having negative repercussions on our lifestyles and bodies.

'Our research shows that nearly half (48%) of people can't sleep due to back or neck pain but technology could actually be exacerbating the problem.

'Many of my patients who can't sleep will resort to a laptop or a mobile phone to help them get to sleep, for example to watch a film, but the reality is this could further prevent them from sleeping.

'The light given off by screens stimulates the brain making us feel more awake and what's more, when people use technology in bed, they often don't pay attention to their postures which can cause pain and keep them awake.

'We're urging people to make their bedrooms tech-free zones and see what benefits can come from this.'

It said laptops, tablets and smartphones should be banished from the bedrooms.

If tempted to check emails one last time before bed, people should try doing this in the living room or the kitchen then switch off before retiring to bed.

And instead of relying on mobiles for an alarm call, people should invest in a traditional old fashioned alarm clock as this will remove both the temptation to use it and stop its lights disrupting sleep.

But if you have to use devices in bed, make sure your back is supported with a pillow and the device is propped up so it's at eye level.
