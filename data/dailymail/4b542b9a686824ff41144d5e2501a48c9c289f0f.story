Around one in five European students have disappeared without paying back millions of pounds in loans to study at British universities.

Twenty-two per cent of students from EU member states have not be 'traced' after graduating - leaving UK taxpayers to pick up the bill.

A study by the House of 
Commons library, reported by the Daily Telegraph, revealed that EU
students were much less likely to repay
their loans at all and more likely to go missing.

Studying: Students from EU member states are allowed to apply for government loans to take UK courses

In the past six years almost £400 million in Government loans had been 
made to students from Europe.

UK taxpayers handed out more than £100 million in loans in 2010-2011 to fund the UK education of those from countries such as Germany, France, Cyprus,
Romania, Lithuania and Bulgaria.

These students can apply for the same government support as British students to complete courses here, but critics do not believe the repayment of their debt is as vigorous in their own countries.

The UK system of repayment means students reduce their debt with direct payments to the taxman through PAYE when salaries are over 
£21,000 a year.

Working: Almost a quarter of EU students disappeared without making repayments on their loans

There are fears that hundreds
of millions of pounds in loans to EU students may be written off and the bill is 
likely to rise with the introduction of tuition fees of up to 
£9,000 for the first time last September.

The Telegraph reported that Parliamentary research carried out for Hertsmere Conservative MP James Clappison, analysed EU students who claimed loans up to 2010.

It found that EU students were 'much more likely to have not been traced' after graduating, with 22 per cent failing to tell the Student Loans Company where they were.

This compared with just two per cent of all borrowers.

Mr Clappison told the paper: 'I think this should raise serious questions with the Government about how effective we are at getting our money back through the student loans system.

'This is clearly an issue that needs a lot more attention particularly as tuition fees rise.'
