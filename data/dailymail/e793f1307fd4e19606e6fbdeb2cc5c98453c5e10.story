Max Clifford’s wife Jo was fighting back tears yesterday after learning of her husband’s convictions.

The former PA was visibly distraught at her Cotswold cottage in the picturesque village of Broadway as friends and relatives arrived to comfort her.

It has been rumoured that she plans to divorce her husband of four years, and she has been conspicuously absent from his trial.

Planning a divorce? It has been rumoured that the former PA is planning to divorce her husband of four years

Earlier this month, as Clifford anxiously awaited his fate, she was spotted without her wedding ring pottering about near her home.

A friend said she was ‘very, very angry’ and ‘just waiting for guilty verdicts and then she’s going to divorce him for everything he’s got’.

Mrs Clifford - his former PA whom he married in April 2010, seven years after the death of his first wife, Liz - declined to comment on the suggestion she has been speaking to top London divorce lawyer Raymond Tooth.

At Clifford’s trial, she was not called as a character witness and did not attend court by his side as a show of support.

As 
Clifford sat waiting for the verdicts at court, his wife was strolling 
in the pretty Cotswolds village where she has a stone cottage.

The detached grade II listed cottage has three bedrooms and is worth over £600,000.

It emerged during the case that his wife took a secret photocopy of the devastating letter sent to him from one of his victims.

He had shown her the note, and kept it in his bedside drawer. But a second copy was found among his wife’s possessions at the £550,000 Cotswolds cottage, which was bought a year after their 2010 marriage solely in her name.

Clifford admitted he had no idea his wife had made a copy.

When asked whether it was true she had left her husband, Mrs Clifford said: ‘I really can’t comment on that.’ And asked about her visits to Raymond Tooth, she said: ‘I can’t comment on that either.’
