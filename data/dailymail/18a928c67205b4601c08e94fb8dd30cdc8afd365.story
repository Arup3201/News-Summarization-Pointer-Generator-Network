The longstanding host of NBC's the Today show was on the brink of defecting to rival network ABC last year, it has emerged.

Matt Lauer, who has anchored the popular morning programme since 1997, was so close to making the move to ABC last year that everybody close to the situation thought the deal was 'signed, sealed and delivered', according to a report.

The claims emerge amid reports the 55-year-old journalist's $25million NBC contract will not be renewed when it expires next year, after the fiasco surrounding the dismissal of former co-anchor Ann Curry saw his popularity with viewers take a nosedive.

ABC chiefs including Bob Iger, CEO of parent company Disney, and Ben Sherwood, ABC News boss, all thought the move was confirmed, as did Lauer's agent, according to a report in the New York Post.

The NBC stalwart would have become an ABC News personality, co-hosted the Katie Couric talk show, and taken an occasional role on Good Morning America, said the report, which cited New York magazine.

But the journalist changed his mind and decided to stay at NBC, a decision which is said to have left Mr Iger and others 'infuriated'.

The Today show was thrown into turmoil after co-anchor Ann Curry was sacked from her post, and Mr Lauer was not seen to fight for his colleague.

The handling of Ms Curry's dismissal prompted a backlash from viewers of the show, which is now in second place behind Good Morning America in the ratings.

Mr Lauer's Q Score - the television 
industry's measure of popularity - has slumped from 19 last September to
9 in January. Good Morning America host George Stephanopoulos now ranks
higher than Mr Lauer in the popularity stakes for the first time.

Earlier
this month it was reported that the high-profile television 
personality's $25million contract will not be renewed when it expires 
next year.

Willie Geist, 37, and David Gregory, 42, have been named as potential replacements for Mr Lauer in news reports in the U.S.
