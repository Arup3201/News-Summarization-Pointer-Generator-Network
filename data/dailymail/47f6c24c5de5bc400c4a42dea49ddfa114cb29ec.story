Mitt Romney has criticised President Barack Obama's presence on the world stage - claiming he has been outperformed by Russian President Vladimir Putin 'time and time again'.

The former Masssachusetts Governor suggested that America's stature on the international political scene has 'diminished' in recent months while Russia has managed to 'elevate' its position.

Romney, who was beaten by Mr Obama in the 2012 U.S. presidential election, gave the damning verdict during an interview with NBC.

Critical: Mitt Romney has claimed Barack Obama is being 'outperformed' by Russian President Vladimir Putin 'again and again' on the world stage

Unflattering verdict: Romney claimed America's stature on the international political scene has diminished while President Barack Obama, pictured left, has been in power while Russia's has elevated under Putin

He said: 'I think most observers of the international political scene suggest that Russia has elevated itself in stature and America has been diminished.'

Mr Romney, who managed the 2002 Winter Games in Salt Lake City, Utah, just months after the September 11 terrorist attacks, made the comments as he expressed his confidence the Sochi Winter Olympics will be safe for visitors.

Mr Romney added he would have no qualms about taking his own family to Russia to watch the Games.

In spite of the anti-Russian rhetoric he adopted during the 2012 campaign, Mr Romney was also very complimentary of the Russian government’s efforts to secure the site.

He said: ‘There's never been a Games that I know of that has been so targeted for specific threats as you're seeing at Sochi. At the same time, the level of security preparations appears to be at an unprecedented level.

‘I believe the Games will be safe. That doesn’t mean there’s a 100 per cent guarantee anywhere in the world today. But this is, after all, a dangerous corner of the world.

Speaking of the past: Mitt Romney was in charge of the Salt Lake City Olympic Games in Utah in 2002, just months after the September 11 terrorist attacks, and said Russia seems to be handling security threats well

‘The specific threats that have been leveled suggest that this is an area that could be targeted and therefore there's a degree of risk associated with, well frankly life today in a world where terrorism exists.’

Romney said that while the warnings about the Black Widow terrorists and other specific women that appear to pose a threat to the safety of the Games may come as shocking and scary to some, he sees them as examples of the efficiency of the organizers.

‘Extraordinary intelligence work - that's what happened with our Games that gave me confidence that they'd be safe,’ he said.

‘Now and then we'll hear reports of an individual they're looking for - that suggests they have pretty good intelligence so all in all, it seems to be a very effective security program, but again, no 100 per cent guarantee.’

Changing tune: In spite of his harsh rhetoric against Russia during the 2012 campaign, Romney said that they were taking ever possible precaution in the lead up to the Sochi Games

One point that he parsed out was that he has a high level of confidence of the security at the ‘hard sites’ where the physical events will take place, keeping the athletes and spectators safe during the tournaments, but soft sites will remain an issue - just as they do throughout the world- because there is no way for security officials to check everyone in public areas.

‘Terrorists can move almost wherever they want to go. It only takes one person to go through a sieve of some kind and so a place like Sochi can be surrounded if you will,’ Mr Romney said.

‘I think that people can recognize that the hard sites and the athletes will be safe and spectators when they're in the venues will be safe but it’s the soft places that you can’t be 100 per cent certain will be entirely safe, but my guess is that Russians have done everything humanly possible to protect the Games.’

He maintained that while he still views Russia as a ‘geopolitical adversary’ of the United States and the world since ‘their friends are some of the world's worst actors’ that is not justification enough to keep the Games away from the country.
