QPR 2-3 Liverpool: Click here to read Neil Ashton's match report from Loftus Road 

Brendan Rodgers may suggest otherwise, but things just aren't clicking for Mario Balotelli in England.

The Liverpool striker looked off the pace again against QPR on Sunday, missing an open goal and frustrating team-mates with his decision-making in the final third.

Balotelli is still yet to hit the back of the net in his second spell in the Premier League following his £16m move from AC Milan, and fans may run out of patience.

Brendan Rodgers looks on at Loftus Road... he said that Balotelli is 'working really hard' to improve

Balotelli's Liverpool team-mates, including Adam Lallana, were often questioning his decision making

Scored just one goal in his last 22 Premier League appearances, despite attempting 73 shots (incl. blocked) in these games.

Has now had 30 shots this season in the Premier League (incl. blocks). Only two players (Aguero 36, Pelle 32) have had more.

Has attempted more shots (30, incl. blocked) without actually scoring than any other player in the top five European leagues this season.

'It'll drop for the boy,' Rodgers told reporters after the game at Loftus Road. 'The most important thing to me is his work rate. He's working really hard. It'll drop for him.'

Putting in the effort for his team is not a characteristic familiar with Balotelli, who often shied away from challenges with opposing centre backs Steven Caulker and Richard Dunne during the win.

In fact, the 24-year-old has laid on just one assist in his Premier League career to date - with two years at Manchester City included - while he is experiencing the second longest goal drought of his career (10 league games).

Strikers struggle to hide behind such damning statistics, and Balotelli did anything but that with his second-half miss.

Adam Lallana's shot was parried by goalkeeper Alex McCarthy, leaving 'Super Mario' with a simple task from eight yards out. However, the ball ballooned over the bar, much to the amusement of the home fans.

Such a miss won't do anything for Balotelli, or his current perception in the public eye. 

This is a man who was brought in to replace Luis Suarez, a player presumably capable of filling in for Daniel Sturridge, too.

Rodgers, though, attempted to divert any comparisons between his under-performing striker and Suarez.

'He's seen as a direct replacement to Luis [Suarez]. I've said before, Luis is irreplaceable, a real world-class talent. 

'That's not what's being asked of Mario. He's a great boy, I've enjoyed working with him. He wants to be better. He's a completely different player to Luis.'

Suarez was constantly the man getting Liverpool out of trouble, and would have been eager to make a mends had he been the one guilty of missing a gilt-edged opportunity. 

Balotelli barely celebrated when his side wrapped up the three points.

'I can see already that the Liverpool fans really like me, although I know that maybe they are a little upset because I don't score,' Balotelli told Sport Magazine last week.

He had better hope that time comes soon, or fans may not 'really like him' for much longer.
