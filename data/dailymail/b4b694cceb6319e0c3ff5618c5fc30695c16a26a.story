Bali Nine ringleader Myuran Sukumaran has spoken candidly from inside Kerobokan prison of the good he believes he could do if he was ever released from jail.

New footage has emerged of Sukumaran, shot as a part of a documentary in May last year, of Sukumaran discussing his hopes for the future before his bid for clemency was rejected.

'I think I can do a lot of good on the outside if I ever got free. It's not like I'm just going to go back after all this and just sit and be somewhere,' reported 9news.

'I would want to do stuff like work and make good stuff and help people,' he told Norwegian educator Ivar Schou, who met the Australian while running rehabilitation programs inside the prison.

Sukumaran, who now faces the death penalty along with fellow inmate Andrew Chan, said that he believed he had done wrong but that he felt his punishment was too harsh.

'I accept what I did was wrong and I think I should be punished for it,' he said.

'But I do think the death penalty is too excessive.' 

Sukumaran was convicted in 2005 after attempting to smuggle 8.3kg of heroin from Bali to Australia. He has called Kerobokan prison in Bali his home for the past ten years, along with Chan.

Sukumaran describes the immense change that he has seen in his life over the past ten years, most notably when he and other inmates were allowed to start education.

'(Life’s) changed a lot. The first five years I didn’t do much with my life. It was pretty much spent inside the prison. I pretty much woke up every morning, I did some sport, I ate, I waited (until) lockdown. I woke up the next day and repeated again,' news.com.au reported him as saying.

'Then occasionally I’d have somebody visit me. I pretty much did that for five years,' Sukumaran says.

'In 2009 they finally gave us permission to start working and doing some projects. Slowly slowly it helped me with my life. It kept me busy. It helped me be productive. I started learning and I was able to help other people learning.'

The Australian said that in the past ten years, the only thing that has consistently brought him joy has been helping others, and that being productive was his only real choice in order to avoid being 'destructive'.

The release of the very candid interview comes as a painting of the Indonesian President Joko Widodo was revealed, inscribed with the message 'People Can Change'.

Sukumaran painted the oil on canvas portrait of Mr Widodo in January after hearing that his bid for clemency was rejected.

The Australian has recently completed his Fine Arts degree through Curtin University and has used his art as therapy for himself and other prisoners.  

Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop spoke about the impending execution of Sukumaran and fellow Bali Nine ringleader Andrew Chan on ABC's Q&A program on Monday night.

'I'm not going to give up hope while they are still alive,' Ms Bishop said.

'I will continue to make representations as we are across Government, at every level across all the Indonesian departments, and the Indonesian ministers, the Australian Government’s counterparts, we will continue to do that, and we are joined by other nations whose citizens are also facing death by firing squad, and we are working very hard, leaving no stone unturned, in our efforts to ensure that we can seek a permanent stay of execution for them'

Ms Bishop said that she could find no good purpose that could be served by the execution of the two Australians, especially considering the strides they had made to improving the lives of fellow prisoners.  

She pointed to the work the pair had been involved in, including the education and encouragement they provided to others in the jail. 

'They are involved in the rehabilitation of other prisoners. Andrew Chan is now a Pastor. He has got a theology degree. He is providing a spiritual nourishment to other prisoners,' Ms Bishop said.

'Myuran Sukumaran is now an accomplished artist and he is taking art classes, master classes in art, and I just think that it would be a terrible injustice if these men were to pay for their crimes with their lives.'

Ms Bishop echoed Sukumaran's sentiments in his interview, agreeing that the men should not be put to death for their role in the drug smuggling ring.

'Yes, they are paying for their crimes, they are repaying their debt to society, but they shouldn't have to pay with their lives.'

 'I'm not going to give up hope while they are still alive,' Ms Bishop said

'I'm not asking Indonesia to do any more than Indonesia asks other countries. So my appeal, again, is to President Widodo to show mercy, humanity, forgiveness and spare the lives of these two Australians.' 

The news comes as it was revealed that Chan asked his girlfriend Febyanti Herewila if she would be his wife when she visited him in Kerobokan prison in February. 

Febyanti immediately accepted his proposal, despite the fact that she knew he was condemned to death by Indonesian president Joko Widodo.

Febyanti and Chan met each other in Kerobokan prison in 2012 after a friend introduced the pair.

The Indonesian had been visiting the prison as part of her role as a pastor and Chan was carrying out theological studies in the hope of becoming a minister.

Since then they have dreamed of his release, even talking about plans to have children together one day.   

Speaking to The Daily Telegraph Febyanti claimed she is totally in love with Chan and she did not accept his proposal out of pity for the Bali Nine prisoner.

'I love him for who he is. And I see what he does for other people and that makes me love him more,' Febyanti said.  

Convicted drug smuggler Andrew Chan proposed to his girlfriend Febyanti Herewila (pictured with ring) of three years when he discovered his clemency bid had been rejected by Indonesian authorities.

Febyanti Herewila Febyanti immediately accepted his proposal, despite the fact that she knew he was condemned to death.

'If you ask me why do I love him, it's because he also has weaknesses as well but he also has a lot of good things about him. I accept him the way he is. I am also very proud of him.'  

Febyanti and Chan's brother attempted to visit him one last time in Kerobokan prison last Wednesday before his transfer to the Indonesian 'death island' but were denied access.

On Monday, Febyanti was one of a selected number of family members who visited Chan on Nusakambangan island. 

Along with fellow Bali nine prisoner Myuran Sukumaran they hold out desperate hope that a last ditch legal appeal will bring them mercy.

The family members were driven in a motorcade from the airport in Cilacap before climbing aboard a small boat, assisted by embassy officials, to visit the Nusakambangan prison island. 

Michael Chan, the brother of death-row prisoner Andrew Chan, and Chintu Sukumaran, the brother of Myuran Sukumaran spoke to journalists at Wijayapura port. 

Hopeful that it won’t be the last time they see their loved-ones, Chan's mother Helen and Sukumaran's parents Sam and Raji and his sister Brintha also made the emotional journey.

The Age reports Chinthu told reporters: 'My mum, sister and I have been waiting and counting down the days. We have been told he is doing well but we just want to see for ourselves, just make sure to go and see him, to let him know that we love him.'

Michael said: 'Mum is fairly excited to see Andy today and it's been a few days, you know. We are looking forward to seeing him when we get over there.'

Lawyers for the death row inmates say there are positive signs in a grim situation.
