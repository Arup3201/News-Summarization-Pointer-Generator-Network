Chelsea are set to send more players to the World Cup than any other club, with up to 18 stars from Jose Mourinho's side ready to descend on Brazil.

The west London club have had two more players selected for provisional and final 23-man squads than rivals Manchester United, who have 16 stars potentially on their way to South America.

Four of Chelsea's squad have been selected to represent the host nation by manager Luiz Felipe Scolari, with Oscar, Willian, Ramires and David Luiz all in line to play on home soil.

The Blues also have England duo Frank Lampard and Gary Cahill, Spain pair Fernando Torres and Cesar Azpilicueta and Belgian stars Eden Hazard, Romelu Lukaku and Thiabaut Courtois all set for international action next month.

The rest of Chelsea's World Cup contingent is made up of Cameroon's Samuel Eto'o, Germany's Andre Schurrle, Nigeria's John Obi Mikel, Victor Moses and Kenneth Omeuro, Ghana's Christian Atsu and Holland's Patrick van Aanholt.

United endured their 
worst ever Premier League season, but that didn't stop international 
managers picking their players for this summer's showpiece event.

Wayne Rooney, Javier Hernandez and Robin van Persie are all certain to play in next month's tournament, although Red Devils duo Tom Cleverley and Michael Carrick are both on stand-by for Roy Hodgson's England.

The Old Trafford club have the same amount of players selected as Bundesliga champions Bayern Munich, who make up a large proportion of Germany's squad.

Manuel Neuer, Jerome Boateng, Bastian Schweinsteiger, Toni Kross, Thomas Muller, Mario Gotze and Philipp Lahm all look certain to make Joachim Low's 23-man list.

Serie A side Napoli are the third most well represented club within provisional World Cup squads with 14 players, including Swiss trio Valon Behrami, Blerim Dzemaili and Gokhan Inler boosting their numbers.

The Italians have more than Spanish giants Real Madrid and Barcelona, who could both have a maximum of 13 players - including Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi - pulling on their boots in Brazil.

That's the same amount as recently crowned Premier League champions Manchester City, whose selected players include Argentinian trio Sergio Aguero, Pablo Zabaleta and Martin Demichelis.

Arsenal and Liverpool could both have 12
 players on show in Brazil, although Lucas Leiva has his work cut out to
 make the host nation's final 23 after only being added to Scolari's 
stand-by list earlier this week.

Italian champions Juventus have also had 12 of their stars named in squads this week and they can count themselves unlucky not to have another, after striker Carlos Tevez was omitted from Alejandro Sabella's group.

La Liga leaders and Champions League finalists Atletico Madrid are next with 11 players selected, including Spanish trio Diego Costa, Koke and Juanfran.

Other clubs included on the most represented list include Porto, Inter Milan, AC Milan, Zenit St Petersburg (all 10 players), Borussia Dortmund (eight) and Southampton (seven).
