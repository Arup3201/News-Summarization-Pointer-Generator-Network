Kansas City, Missouri, may not have access to the ocean, but for local resident Georgianna Reid, every day is a beach day.

After three decades spent mowing and watering the lawn around her house on East Meyer Drive, the elderly resident decided to draw a line in the sand, literally, by replacing the greenery with grit. 

‘I would say I'm putting in the largest litter box in the world,' said Ms Reid of her unusual approach to landscaping.

A photo taken by a Google Streetview camera back in 2011 captured Reid's neat two-story red-brick home in the 100 block of East Meyer Boulevard surrounded by trimmed grass.

Burying her head in the sand: Georgiana Reid does not care that some of her neighbors think her property has become an eyesore

Fast-forward to 2014, the woman has turned the land in front of her home into a giant sandbox with outdoor furniture off to one side and garden sculptures of gnomes for decoration.

To execute her design, Ms Reid spent around $4,000 to cart in 80 tons of sand, which she then enclosed with a small fence. 

Reid used to have an oversize chess set in the yard and a volleyball net, but someone had stolen them.

Not everyone has embraced the desert-like front yard. Some of the homeowner's neighbors expressed concern that Reid's sandbox has become an eyesore, which could lower their property values.

'I think the house looks revolting with all that is out there,' neighbor Edwin Bisby told the station KCTV.

Some angered residents have even complained about the king-size 'litter box' to city officials, but an inspector found no code violations on Reid's part.
