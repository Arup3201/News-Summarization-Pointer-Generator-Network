A student pilot became a hero yesterday after making a daring emergency landing on a New York City highway after the small aircraft he had taken on a tour over the Statue of Liberty ran into technical problems.

Michael Schwartz was able to save himself and his two passengers by landing the small plane on the Major Deegan Expressway in the middle of the Bronx.

Despite the risky outmaneuver taking place at 3.20pm all three escaped uninjured and avoided any collisions on the busy road.
