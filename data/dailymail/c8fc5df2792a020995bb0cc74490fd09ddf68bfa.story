It is a landscape of jagged peaks and deep lakes that have never been directly seen with human eyes.

And now it seems the ghostly Gamburtseve Mountains, that are buried beneath two and a half miles (4km) of ice in East Antarctica, are even stranger than scientists could have imagined.

An international team of scientists has found that despite being 500 million years old - 200 million years older than the European Alps - they show almost no signs of weathering.

The haunting images of the Gamburtseve Subglacial Mountains obtained by scientists have earned them the nickname the Ghost Mountains. The clusters of vertical lines in this image show water filled valleys

Instead, the peaks, which rise 8,850ft (2,700 metres) above sea level yet do not break out beyond the surface of the ice, have been preserved by the frozen sheet that lies on top of them.

Stranger still, the scientists have found evidence that melt water from the bottom of the enormous ice sheet may actually be flowing up the mountains.

Snow falling on the surface of the ice sheet causes the temperature close to peaks of the Gamburtsevs to fall in a process called divergent cooling. 

At the same time, heat radiating from the bedrock beneath the ice causes melt water to form rivers and lakes in the deep valley between the mountains.

However, with the huge pressure of the ice on top of them, the water is pushed in the same direction as the ice is flowing, causing water to flow up valleys against gravity.

As this uphill flow meets the colder temperatures from above towards the top of the peaks, it refreezes, protecting the ridge line from erosion.

This effectively cryogenically freezes the mountains in time, making them appear much younger than they are.

Forming around 550 million years ago when two continental plates collided, they should appear far more eroded than they are.

Professor Timothy Creyts, a geophysicist at Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory and lead author of the study, said that in places water is flowing uphill for thousands of metres.

He said: 'Along the southern and northern margins of the Gamburtsevs, the ice surface and bed slopes oppose each other, and water is driven up steep slopes toward thinner ice. 

'These elevation gains are commonly thousands of meters and make these pathways striking examples of glacially driven uphill water flow.'

The research team used data gathered from two twin-engine aircraft equipped with ice penetrating radar, gravity metres and magnetometers to build up a picture of the mountain range.

First discovered in 1958, it took more than 50 years before scientists were able to see what the mountains looked like beneath the ice.

The fuzzy grey images they obtained of the towering crags helped to earn the Gamburtsev mountains the nickname of the ghost mountains.

The landscape that emerged was one of saw toothed ridges and towering crags that are more typically associated with younger mountain ranges like the Alps and the Rockies.

The scientists estimate that without the weight of the ice sheet pushing down on them, the mountains would rebound to tower more than 10,800ft (3,300 metres).

In a paper in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, they describe how they also discovered a network of lakes and rivers in the valleys that cut through the Gamburtsevs.

Although meltwater usually speeds up erosion of mountains by glaciers, it seems that in the Gamburtsevs the water refreezes on the ridgelines to protect them 

Researchers used ice penetrating radar and other sensors onboard aircraft that they flew above ice to build up the first picture of the rugged landscape of the Gamburtsev mountains below. From above the ice is flat

The high pressure from the ice above pushes meltwater in the valleys below the ice uphill in the same direction as the overlying ice is flowing, creating a frozen barrier around the ridgeline that protects against erosoin

Using an underwater robot, polar scientists have been able to to build up a detailed three dimensional picture of the ice that builds up over the sea each winter.

The depth of ice around Antarctica is notoriously difficult to measure due to the thick blanket of snow that covers it.

But now high-resolution mapping of the sea ice using an autonomous underwater vehicle known as SeaBed has shown that it is up to 56 feet thick in some places.

It was typically thought that the ice was only a few metres thick in most areas.

In some places, the weight of the ice sheet forces water to flow against the pull of gravity. This uphill flow refreezes when it meets colder temperatures coming from the ice above.

Professor Creyts said: 'The ice sheet acts like an anti-aging cream. 

'It triggers a series of thermodynamic processes that have almost perfectly preserved the Gamburtsevs since ice began spreading across the continent.'

Dr Fausto Ferraccioli, head of airborne geophysics at the British Antarctic Survey and a co-author on the paper, added that this process is thought to have been occurring for around 34 million years since glaciers began forming on Antarctica.

He said: 'How mountain ranges form and are preserved in the middle of old continents for millions of years are fundamental questions in Earth Sciences. 

'Our new research has important additional ramifications for our understanding of long-term climate and ice sheet change. 

'This study shows that interplays between topography, water, ice sheets and tectonics must be considered in order to understand the preservation of mountain ranges such as the Gamburtsev Subglacial Mountains. 

'If these mountains in interior East Antarctica had been more significantly eroded, then the ice sheet itself may have had a different history.' 

First discovered in 1958, it took more than 50 years before scientists could see what the mountains looked like beneath the ice. The mountains (marked) are two and a half miles (4km) under the east of the continent 

The researchers have been able to build up the first picture of what lies beneath the ice of East Antarctica

The lost boys never aged while they were in Never Never Land in JM Barrie's book Peter Pan, and it seems that the Gamburtsev mountains beneath the antarctic ice are also protected from the ravages of time

Images from ice penetrating radar and other sensors reveal Antarctica's Gamburtseve Mountains as a landscape of razor sharp ridges and peaks

Pressure from ice sheet above forces water  uphill for thousands of metres

Peaks tower more than 8,800ft above sea level but are totally buried by ice

Gamburtseve Mountains are around 200 million years older than the Alps

Yet scientists found little sign of erosion as water flowing uphill refreezes and creates a protective barrier around the peaks to preserve them
