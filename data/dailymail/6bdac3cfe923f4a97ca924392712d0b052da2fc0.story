Lena Dunham is reportedly threatening to sue the right-wing website which last week accused her of sexually abusing her little sister Grace when they were children.

In the wake of the allegations,  the creator and star of HBO's Girls, has cancelled two stops on her book tour scheduled this week in Belgium and Germany for health issues. 

On Monday,  she tweeted that she was 'deeply sorry' to miss the Antwerp Book Fair and a signing in Berlin, adding that she's 'so grateful for your energy and support'.

Last week, right-wing website Truth Revolt excerpted a portion from Lena's new book about her childhood curiosity with the female reproductive system and labelled it 'unsettling' and 'disturbing'. 

Today, that website claims that Lena is threatening to sue them if they don't remove the article she claims is 'false and defamatory' and publish an apology note.

The website adamantly declined, and editor Ben Shapiro wrote another article explaining why they would not heed to the demands of Lena's lawyers.

'We refuse. We refuse to withdraw our story or apologize for running it, because quoting a woman’s book does not constitute a “false” story, even if she is a prominent actress and left-wing activist. 

'Lena Dunham may not like our interpretation of her book, but unfortunately for her and her attorneys, she wrote that book – and the First Amendment covers a good deal of material she may not like, the article reads. 

The passage that Truth Revolt excerpted details a conversation that then-year-old Lena had with her mother, famed artist Laurie Simmons, about women's organs.

In the course of the conversation, young Lena asks her mother if little sister Grace's vagina looks like hers.

'I guess so, Just smaller,' her mother responds

'One day, as I sat in our driveway in Long Island playing with blocks and buckets, my curiosity got the best of me,' Dunham writes

Allegations: A right-wing website published a story last week, citing an incident detailed in Lena's (right) new book as evidence of molestation. The essay descirbes a curious 7-year-old Lena looking at her then 1-year-old sister Grace's (left) vagina after having a conversation with her mother about female reproductive organs.

'Grace was sitting up, babbling and smiling, and I leaned down between her legs and carefully spread open her vagina. She didn’t resist and when I saw what was inside I shrieked.

'My mother came running. “Mama, Mama! Grace has something in there!”

'My mother didn’t bother asking why I had opened Grace’s vagina. This was within the spectrum of things I did. 

'She just on her knees and looked for herself. It quickly became apparent that Grace had stuffed six or seven pebbles in there. My mother removed them patiently while Grace cackled, thrilled that her prank had been a success.'  

Truth Revolt  responded described the essay as 'unsettling' and 'disturbing' in an article titled  'Lena Dunham Describes Sexually Abusing Her Little Sister'

The article reads: 'Lena Dunham describes experimenting sexually with her younger sister Grace, whom she says she attempted to persuade to kiss her using “anything a sexual predator might do.” 

In one particularly unsettling passage, Dunham experimented with her six-year younger sister’s vagina.' 

They also originally wrote that Dunham was 17 at the time of the incident, and later added a correction saying 'This article has been modified to correct a typo in the book excerpt incorrectly listing Dunham's age as seventeen'. 

Obviously upset with being named as a child molester, Dunham took to Twitter on Saturday to lash out at Truth Revolt for their damaging article three days after it was published.

The website has refused to apologize for the article.

'If Ms. Dunham says that our quotations from her book were “false,” or that our interpretation of those events was libelous under the law, then we look forward to asking her, in her deposition, about why they appeared in her book,' editor Ben Shapiro wrote on Tuesday.

'We also look forward to asking her why she believes it is now appropriate for a 28-year-old woman to make light of opening her baby sister’s vagina, paying her with candies for prolonged kisses on the lips in the manner of a “sexual predator,” or masturbating in bed next to her prepubescent sister,' he added.  

Grace Dunham also appears to have responded to the allegations in her own Twitter rant on Monday, writing vaguely about heternormativity and what is and is not considered 'normal' behavior. 

Grace writes that she supports writers 'narrating their own experiences, determining for themselves what has and has not been harmful'. 

She also posted: '2day, like every other day, is a good day to think about how we police the sexualities of young women, queer, and trans people.'

While the tweets seem to address the criticism of her sister's essay, they do not directly come out and support the personal story that her sister shared with the world. 

The sisters appear to have a difference of opinion on the Truth Revolt article, according to one tweet Lena wrote on Saturday. 

'Sometimes I get so mad I burn write up. Also, I wish my sister wasn't laughing so hard,' Dunham tweeted on November 1.
