2,000-year-old  artefacts looted from ancient sites in Iraq and Syria by ISIS are being sold on eBay as jihadis cash in on relics dating back millennia.

Jewellery, ceramics and coins plundered from museums within ISIS territory are known to pass between criminal gangs before turning up in Gulf States and later appearing on trading websites.

Two coins from Apamea, in western Syria, which date back to Ancient Greece have appeared on eBay with price tags of £57 and £90.

Selling on eBay: Historical artefacts believed to have been looted by ISIS, such as this coin of Apamea dating back to the time of Ancient Greece, are beginning to appear on eBay

This comes after entire Roman mosaics were ripped up by a bulldozer from the ancient site.

The trade in antiquities is a profitable business for the terror group and is thought to be worth tens of millions of pounds, The Times reports.

As well as looting ancient artefacts, ISIS is known to levy a 'tax on valuable and historical items found in its territory to ensure the group's central administration benefits financially from raids on museums.

The number of artefacts flowing from the war zone is so great that their market price has actually fallen.

Spoils of war: Small coins such as these are easy to smuggle across borders to criminal gangs in neighbouring countries. Above, the artefact is advertised on eBay

It is believed that ISIS takes orders from dealers in neighbouring countries, with small items such as coins easy to smuggle across borders due to the number of people being displaced.

Using smuggling routes and links to criminal gangs in Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan, the ancient treasures can be packed in with cargoes of oil, drugs and weapons as they move across borders. 

eBay insist that they pay attention to the authorities.

A spokesman for the company told The Times: 'We remove items from sale based on their advice, support law enforcement investigations and are always prepared to investigate listings causing concern.'

Axel Plathe, director of Unesco's Iraq office, told The Times: 'We are seeing a more systematic approach to looting under ISIS, linked to generating revenue. 

Also selling: Another Greek coin advertised as 'Coin of Apamea 'Turreted Tyche & Nike' Era of Pompey Year 16 VF recently sold on eBay for the equivalent of £90

This coin, which came from the ancient city of Apamea in western Syria, sold for $135 on eBay - the equivalent of around £91

'Excavations at the sites have increased and we believe trafficking is on the rise but without access to the sites we still don't know the true scale.'

It is thought that increased pressure from the Iraqi army is encouraging jihadis to loot anything of value in the territory while they can.

They have also desecrated countless Assyrian treasures treasures at Mosul, Nimrud and Dur-Sharrukin.

In Nimrud, northern Iraq, militants even smashed up 3,000 year-old winged statues that are placed at the gates of the Palace of Ashurnasirpal.

Erasing history: Two weeks ago ISIS extremists targeted a museum in Mosul by using power drills and sledge hammers to destroy artefacts, sparking global outrage

Desecration: An ISIS fanatic uses a power tool to destroy a winged-bull Assyrian protective deity at a museum in Mosul two weeks ago 

The attack came just days after extremists targeted a museum in Mosul by using power drills and sledgehammers to destroy artefacts, sparking global outrage.

A statement last week from Iraq's Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities didn't elaborate on the extent of the damage.

However, they added that ISIS 'continues to defy the will of the world and the feelings of humanity.'

The ancient city of Nimrud was the second capital of Assyria, an ancient kingdom that began in 900BC, partially in present day Iraq, and became a great regional power.

The city, which was destroyed in 612 BC, is located on the Tigris River, just south of Mosul, which was captured by ISIS last June.
