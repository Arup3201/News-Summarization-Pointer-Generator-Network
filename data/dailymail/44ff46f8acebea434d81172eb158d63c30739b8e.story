One of English football’s best-known referees has been censured by the FA for making a racist comment at an officials’ summit.

David Elleray, former house-master at Harrow School and the highest-profile official at the start of the Premier League, racially abused Robert McCarthy, who is black and a referee coaching manager for the FA in non-league football, at a referees’ meeting at St George’s Park on June 21.

Elleray was heard by a number of people to say to McCarthy: ‘You looked rather tanned’, adding: ‘have you been down a coal mine?’

Investigation: The FA said that no official complaint was made about the incident

The FA investigated the incident and on Thursday night said: ‘While no official complaint was made, the FA gave this matter its full consideration and it is our view that the comment did breach the

FA Council Code of Conduct.’ Elleray, 59, is chairman of the FA’s referee committee. He also sits on UEFA’s referees committee and acts as a technical adviser to FIFA. He was made an MBE for services to football in the Queen’s birthday honours last month.

Alistair Maclean, the FA’s company secretary and group legal director, carried out the investigation when reports of Elleray’s inappropriate behaviour first reached Wembley. He has been formally reminded of the importance of the code, his duties as a council member and required to undertake equality and diversity training.

Elleray has apologised unreservedly, but it is difficult to see how this slap on the wrist will end an incident Wembley ‘consider closed’. His positions at the FA, UEFA and FIFA look untenable, especially given the FA’s commitment to diversity at all levels of football. The FA will also be embarrassed that such an own goal from one of their senior figures follows their strong stance against Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore’s sexist email exchange.

Elleray, who retired as housemaster of Druries in 2009, did not respond to calls on Thursday night.

The All England Club, which has a long history of equal rights including  prize-money, is forging a surprisingly close relationship with the Augusta National golf club, whose membership could never be described as diverse. The mutual admiration society has even seen Wimbledon’s junior digital staff invited to Augusta, while the bespoke clothes hangers in the Wimbledon locker rooms are based on the Masters design.

BBC broadcaster John Inverdale’s comment at last year’s Wimbledon that champion Marion Bartoli was ‘never going to be a looker’ created such a storm that the then Culture Secretary Maria Miller wrote to the BBC director general demanding action. However the All England Cub have welcomed Inverdale back into the fold to the extent that both his daughters, Josie and Juliette, have been employed in the broadcast office during the tournament. 

Andy Murray will drop to No 10 in the rankings at the end of Wimbledon and any further slide is likely to have a significant impact on his earnings as most of the deals involving the leading players have financial penalties for being out of the top 10. Murray signed a £4.6million deal with Standard Life on the eve of the tournament and while their top brass were at Wimbledon to watch Murray begin his title defence, they missed Wednesday’s horror show against Grigor Dimitrov.

BBC Sport presenters and pundits plugging their sponsorships has become a sensitive issue this summer, with Jonathan Agnew (Waitrose) and Garry Richardson (Unibet) having to curtail their involvement.

Yet All England Club committee man Tim Henman has been allowed to blatantly promote his backers HSBC on the Beeb with only a mild censure. Henman, wearing tennis kit for a breakfast television interview, was asked what he was doing and seized the opportunity to mention the bank.

A BBC spokesman said: ‘The BBC makes every effort to not give undue prominence to any event sponsors. On this occasion Tim made a mistake and has been reminded of the BBC’s editorial guidelines.’ 

The Beeb added that Agnew and Richardson had, unlike Henman, been using their BBC role for commercial purposes.

Roger Federer’s entourage at Wimbledon contains a remarkable five nannies. But all are said to be needed, with Roger’s wife Mirka having given birth last May to twin boys Leo and Lennart, brothers for twin girls Myla and Charlene, who were born five years ago.

It will hardly help the integrity of the ICC that YP Singh, the head of their anti-corruption and security unit, is the subject of an inquiry after being reported for allegedly making inappropriate sexual advances during an ICC dinner in Melbourne. It is understood Singh was the worse for wear when the alleged incident took place in the members’ dining room at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.
