England football fans travelling to next summer's World Cup in Brazil are at risk of being targeted by violent criminal gangs, it was claimed today

Armed thugs are reportedly planning to steal from and even kidnap supporters, who they have branded 'naive', sometimes at gun-point.

Gangs will seek out England fans, because they believe they will be carrying the most money on them, as well as expensive items such as smartphones and cameras.

Prized: Gangs will seek out England fans, because they believe they will be carrying the most money on them, as well as expensive items such as smartphones and cameras

Sao Paulo, where the team will play its opening match against Uruguay on June 19, is already one of the most dangerous cities on the planet.

More than 100 violent murders are carried out every month, and this September alone there were nearly 11,000 armed robberies.

More than 60,000 street robberies have taken place in the city, which has a population of 27million people, this year, and more than 360 people have been killed during hold-ups.

And according to the Daily Star, the gangs are threatening to up the number of attacks during the World Cup, when 600,000 tourists are expected to visit the city.

The boss of one gang, operating out of a shack just yards from opening ceremony venue the Corinthians Arena, said he expected to make around 100,000 reals, worth roughly Â£25,000, during the tournament.

'Every England fan who can afford to travel to Brazil is rich, in my view. I'm poor, so they'll all be richer than me,' he told the newspaper, brandishing a .38 calibre pistol.

'They'll be naive and easy to rob, much easier than people from Sao Paulo, who are used to having a gun pointing at them.'

The man, who called himself Joao, said the tourists would also carry valuable items, such as cameras and phones, with them - unlike locals.

He said that all criminals would need to do to find their victims is to look for those wearing England replica shirts, and that although fans would be safe once inside the stadium, they would have to use public transport or taxis to get there.

'I'm not interested in targeting the footballers, and we don't do kidnappings. But there are other groups who are planning these things,' said the 35-year-old from the Vida Loka gang.

He added that there were criminals operating in the city who would 'do anything' to get money.
