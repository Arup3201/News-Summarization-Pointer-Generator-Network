Dennis Rodman's next return to the public eye may be as tempestuous as his last.

A trailer for the newest documentary to follow the the former NBA bad boy's exploits in North Korea shows the 53-year-old breaking down in tears over public criticism about his friendship with Kim Jong-un.

'I’m not Martin Luther King,' he says through a flood of tears as he reveals he's frequently the target of death threats. 'If someone wanted to shoot me, please, do it today.'

The film is called Dennis Rodman’s Big Bang In Pyongyang and follows the retired athlete's second trip to the DPRK when he took with him several follow former NBA players to play a game in honor of the notorious tyrant's birthday last January.

In the video obtained by Deadline, Rodman claims he had no idea about many of the atrocities committed by Kim Jon-un, such as the execution of Kim's uncle in a dramatic political purge that happened just before the visit.

'I didn't know that,' he says.

Rodman also defended himself against criticism he received for not doing more to get political prisoner Kenneth Bae freed.

'That's not my job, you know,' he said. Though, as Deadline notes, Rodman would at one point ask Kim via Twitter 'do me a solid and let Kenneth Bae loose.'

Rodman is not expected to do press ahead of the premier. However, according to Deadline, that could all change if the film gets a wider theatrical release. 

The film is called Dennis Rodman's Big Bang in Pyongyang and follows The Worm's exploits in late 2013 and early 2014 as he took a team of fellow retired NBA players to the DPRK to play a game in honor of Kim Jong-un's birthday
