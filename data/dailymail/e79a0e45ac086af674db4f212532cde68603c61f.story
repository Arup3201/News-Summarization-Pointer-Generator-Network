Southampton have made a formal enquiry to Burnley as they attempt to launch their rebuilding project with the signing of striker Danny Ings. 

The England Under 21 international will see his contract expire at the end of next season and Southampton believe that they can secure the forward ahead of the new season.

As things stand, Burnley manager Sean Dyche is demanding £8 million for Ings, who struck 26 goals as Burnley were promoted from the Championship last season. Southampton need a striker to replace Rickie Lambert, who has joined Liverpool, and Ings fits the club’s model to recruit young and ambitious English players.

However, Burnley’s valuation of the 21-year-old is proving problematic, as Ings will be available on a free transfer in twelve months’ time if he cannot be persuaded to sign an extension with the Lancashire club.

Everton and Newcastle are also monitoring the player’s situation, while German sides Wolfsburg and Bayer Leverkusen are also keeping tabs on Ings.

Southampton are aware that foreign clubs will have the right to speak to Ings from January and they would be able to negotiate a pre-contract agreement with a reduced compensation rate from the turn of the year.

Burnley would ideally like to keep Ings at the club but there is also a recognition that they risk losing him for nothing if a deal cannot be struck this summer.

Although Southampton are reluctant to meet the asking price, the swathes of cash flowing into the club following the £31.5million sale of Luke Shaw to Manchester United and Adam Lallana’s impending £25m move to Liverpool, means that the club may be prepared to take the hit as new manager Ronald Koeman seeks to reconstruct his squad.
