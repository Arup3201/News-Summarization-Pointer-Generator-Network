He might be a monkey, but Dr Dolittle star Wilson is clearly used to getting his own way.

WhenÂ KHOU-TV host Deborah Duncan teased the hungry primate with a grape on live television - holding it out and pulling it back briefly - he wasn't impressed.

After snatching the fruit from her hands, the capuchin monkey slapped Duncan across the face.

'I think you just got told by a monkey,' Wilson's keeper joked, wagging his finger at Duncan.
