A bank clerk who dreamed of becoming a model stole £46,000 from the tills – and spent it on plastic surgery and shopping sprees.

Rachael Claire Martin, 24, used the cash to fund a boob job, dental work and liposuction, as well as hair extensions and nights out.

She took thousands at a time from her Barclays branch in Liskeard, Cornwall, in an eight-week period.

cash on breast enlargements and liposuction in a desperate bid to become
 a professional model 

The tattooed mother of one, who no 
longer works for the bank, is thought to have spent £4,000 on the breast
 surgery and £1,700 on dental procedures, including treatment to whiten 
her teeth.

Astonishingly, she used her court appearance to show off the proceeds of her crime.

On what is believed to be her Twitter 
account, Martin posted a photograph of herself standing outside the 
entrance to court two of Truro Crown Court with her breasts exposed.

Martin hoped to become a model

Martin initially denied 25 counts of 
theft in 2010.

But on what should have been the first day of a week-long
 trial, she admitted a single charge of theft covering the full amount 
of £46,000.

Dressed in black with a leopard-print 
jacket, she spoke only to confirm her name and enter a guilty plea 
during a short hearing.

Recorder Jeremy Wright released her on 
unconditional bail.

The court heard Martin, of St Austell,
 typically stole £1,000 or £2,000 at a time, putting the funds into her 
own account. On one occasion she took £6,000.

By the time the thefts were noticed, 
Martin is believed to have spent all of the stolen cash. She will be 
sentenced in September.

Last year two siblings who used stolen credit card details to pay for breast enlargements were spared jail.

Rishona Carlene Downes, 25, and her 
27-year-old sister Ramona Charlene spent more than £4,000 each on the 
procedures.

They were given the credit card numbers by a friend who 
worked for American Express.

Judge Christopher Hardy handed them 12-month community orders with 120 hours of unpaid work.

Last month a mother of five who used her £29,000-a-year benefits to pay for a similar operation was jailed for shoplifting.

Kelly Fannin, 34, spent £4,500 of 
taxpayers' cash enlarging her 34A chest to a 34D.

She sparked outrage 
when she gave an interview in 2010 boasting about her lavish spending 
while on benefits.

Fannin, who had been spared jail three times in five years for a series of previous thefts, was imprisoned for 16 weeks.
