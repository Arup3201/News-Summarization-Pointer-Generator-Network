What has two legs, two wheels, and more than 60,000 Instagram followers? TurboRoo the dog.

Just five month ago, TurboRoo, a two-legged Chihuahua, was given up by his owner, who could no longer care for the disabled pup, to a veterinarian in Indianapolis. 

But now, the pooch is on his way to Los Angeles to receive the CW Network's 'Underdog of the Year Award,'IndyStar reports.

With the help of a 3-D printer, TurboRoo received two front wheels allowing him to stand upright and move around as if he had four legs. 

Since he first received his wheels, the overcoming pup has gained national fame amassing more than 60,000 Instagram followers, more than 27,000 'likes' on Facebook, he has become the mascot and namesake of TurboRoo Designs -- a small company that 3-D prints carts for disabled dogs --, and now he's receiving his first award as one of the world's most influential pups.

'I fell in love with him,' Ashley Looper, a veterinarian technician and TurboRoo's owner, told IndyStar of the pup who she took in at only four weeks old.

'I know what it takes to care for a dog as special as him because I have worked with special needs pets in the past so it was just a perfect fit and I adopted him straight away.'

The Chihuahua, born without front legs, was forced to hop around everywhere he went. 

Although his mother fed him his first few weeks, once the disabled pup was weaned, the other dogs wouldn't let him near any food, according to ABC.

The couple that owned TurboRoo initially said they had visited several veterinarian's seeking help for the pup -- who weighed only 10 pounds at the time-- before they found Looper. 

They told IndyStar that several veterinarians said the pup should be euthanized, but they didn't want that to happen.

Toys: In the care of Ashley Looper, a veterinarian technician, the pup received a makeshift mobility cart, made out of PVC pipe and pieces of Fisher Price toys

In the care of Looper, TurboRoo received a makeshift mobile cart made out of PVC pipe and pieces of a Fisher Price toy. This only proved to be a little effective.

Soon, Mark Deadrick, president of 3DYN, saw a story online about the pup and began designing a better mobility cart for him using a 3-D printer, IndyStar reports.

With that, TurboRoo was on the go, capturing more hearts than ever. 

He even attended a Purina pet tech conference in October where he showed off his mobility.

As the face of TurboRoo Designs, the pup is credited with helping to change the lives of other disabled dogs. 

The company ships two or three of the carts, priced as $300, a week.
