An advert for a 'relaxing' soft drink has been criticised for featuring an air stewardess telling herself that all the passengers are going to die before a flight takes off.

The clip was posted by Czech ad agency, Lowe and and Partners, on YouTube to promote a drink called Zenonade.

A blonde stewardess is shown acting out pre-flight instructions to passengers - but as she smirks to the camera, she tells herself 'I'm going to leave this plane first, and you're all going to die.'

The advert for a new Czech soft drink, Zenonade, features a stewardess telling passengers 'you're all going to die'

The stewardess points to passengers one by one and tells herself 'Dead. Dead. Dead'

As the camera scans the cabin, she looks from one passenger to another and says: 'Dead. Dead. Dead.' She then points at herself and says: 'Alive.'

A voice then comes through on the intercom which says, 'We wish you a pleasant flight'.

The tagline then reads: 'Zenonade: At Your Own Risk.'

An explanation of the advert on YouTube claims that Zenonade is the only 'relaxing' drink on the market.

It reads: 'It has one small disadvantage. Zenonade has never been 
tested, so no one knows what relaxing effect it has on people. That is 
why our new communication recommends to drink it at your own risk.'

A message from the product maker Zenonade claims that the advert intends to put across the message that it should be tried 'at your own risk'

YouTube users were quick to slam the advert.

jeffmakesgames1 said: 'This ad was stupid and I am sure the airlines will agree with this. ﻿ Won't be trying this product.'

Another, Bambi Blue wrote: 'What an odd commercial, heh. I'm not sure it gets 'relaxed' across very well.﻿'

Agency CEO Martin Lochmann told The Huffington Post that the ad hadn't generated many complaints so far.

'I expected it to be worse,' he said, later adding, 'This is not meant to be serious.'
