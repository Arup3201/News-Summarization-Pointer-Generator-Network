Police will be interviewing hundreds of women in eastern Sydney who gave birth late last year amid a massive investigation to reveal the mother of the abandoned baby girl at Maroubra beach.

Two nippers playing in the dunes found the heavily decomposed body buried under 30 cm of sand in late November 2014.

Investigators are now using DNA samples from the baby in a bid to to identify the child and its parents, but they claim the best way of finding the mother is through the community, reports The Saturday Telegraph.

Investigators are now using DNA samples from the baby in a bid to to identify the child and its parents

Detective Superintendent Gavin Dengate, commander of the eastern beaches area, said it is a huge task to investigating the birth records.

'Its is a big job obtaining medical records of pregnant women a couple of months either side of the discovery of the body,' he said.

Investigators are currently focusing only on medical practices in the Maroubra region. DNA samples have recently been sent away for sampling, but Supt Dengate said it will be a long winded process.

'We are hoping to perhaps get a DNA profile but that will take some time. Once we have one we will try to match it with databases we're allowed to access,' he said.

Supt Dengate said that the best chance of finding the child is through speaking with the community.

 'We would ask anyone who may know something to contact police,' he said. 'It's a delicate matter and any information given to us will be treated accordingly.'

He urges anyone with any information to come forward. The baby's remains remain at Glebe morgue.

NSW Coroner's Court spokesman told the Saturday Telegraph 'If the parents are not ­located and an identity cannot be confirmed, the child will be given a state-funded funeral,'  

Locals in the Maroubra area were left shocked and saddened by the discovery of the baby's body. 

The naked baby was discovered by two members of the Under 7 Nippers team as they were digging in the sand dunes about 20 metres from the water's edge. 

The two boys, aged six and seven, found the 'very small' infant while digging in the sand during their weekly Sunday morning session at the southern end of Maroubra Beach in Sydney's eastern suburbs.  

Randwick councillor Brendan Roberts, who was at the scene with his son Oscar when the baby was found, told the Sydney Morning Herald: 'It was just such a contrast – everyone smiling and happy [and] this small little baby was just buried under our feet… it's a little bit stomach-turning.'

The 'very small' infant was dug up about 50 metres away from the closest footpath leading off the beach

 Maroubra Surf Life Saving is providing counselling for the two boys who discovered the body, as well as other surf club members.

The surf lifesaver also mentioned that the far south and north ends of the beach can be troublesome areas, saying that the lack of light or any kind of surveillance meant they attracted some questionable behaviour. 

It was difficult to determine how long the body had been buried due to the heat and location. 

The mayor of Randwick City Council, Ted Seng, said he was shocked and saddened to learn of the baby's discovery. 

'To say that I'm shocked is an understatement. I cannot imagine the circumstances that lead to this tragic event. Our thoughts and the thoughts of the whole Randwick community are with this little lost soul and the family and loved ones.' 

Forensic investigators photographed the body which was protected from the heat by a large blue tarp
