Separated by more than 50 years and an ocean of experience, they were the unlikeliest of bosom friends.

He was a retired Irish priest — albeit a worldly one — and she was a wealthy, 21-year-old American student who was soon to become the most glamorous woman in the world.

And yet, from their first encounter during her visit to Dublin in 1950, Jackie Kennedy was ‘enchanted’ with Father Joseph Leonard, a 73-year-old friend of a friend, as he chaperoned her around the city, taking her on a trip to the theatre and Dublin’s finest French restaurant.

They were to meet only once more, but in an astonishing 14-year correspondence, she poured out her hopes, fears and secrets to the old priest with a candour she admitted she never extended to anyone else.

Private letters: Jackie Kennedy pictured with Father Joseph Leonard in Dublin, Ireland, in 1950. They would only meet once more before he died in 1964, but their 14-year correspondence would shed fresh light on Jackie's most private thoughts

In 33 newly discovered handwritten 
letters, amounting to some 130 pages, the famously tight-lipped Mrs 
Kennedy writes freely of her suspicions about JFK’s fidelity, her 
reservations over his frightening ambition and her utter loneliness and 
anger at his tragic death.

In
 correspondence before and after she joined her husband in the White 
House, she admitted the rising political star was consumed by ambition 
‘like Macbeth’.

Writing in 
1953 — the year they married — she said that politicians were ‘a breed 
apart’ but admitted that she too was vulnerable to their craving for 
attention.

‘Maybe I’m just 
dazzled and picture myself in a glittering world of crowned heads and 
Men of Destiny— and not just a sad little housewife,’ she told the 
priest.

Never seen before: Philip Sheppard of Sheppard's Irish Auction House in Durrow, Co Laois, says that the letters came from 'a private source'

‘That world can be very glamorous from the outside, but if you’re in it — and you’re lonely — it could be a Hell.’

It
 may have taken decades for star-struck Americans to realise their 
revered president was a ruthless and vain womaniser, but his wife saw it
 even before she married him.

In
 July 1952, she had confided to Father Leonard that: ‘I think I’m in 
love with . . . John Kennedy — he’s the son of the ambassador to 
England.’

She continued: 
‘Maybe it will end very happily — or maybe, since he’s this old and set 
in his ways and cares so desperately about his career, he just won’t 
want to give up that much time to extracurricular things like marrying.’

She
 also admitted that she saw some of the characteristics of her own 
hard-drinking, gambling and womanising stockbrother father, John ‘Black 
Jack’ Bouvier, in JFK. Bouvier divorced her mother when Jackie was just 
ten, and it is said he was so drunk at her wedding to JFK that her 
stepfather had to step in to escort her to the altar.

Young love: JFK and Jackie pictured in the early days of their courtship. At this point, Jackie was already writing to Leonard, likening her future husband's womanizing ways to those of her father

Jackie wrote: ‘He’s like my father in a way — loves the chase and is 
bored with the conquest — and once married needs proof he’s still 
attractive, so flirts with other women and resents you,’ she told Father
 Leonard at the end of 1952. ‘I saw how that nearly killed Mummy.’

If
 Kennedy ever did ask her to marry him, she mused, ‘it will be for 
rather practical reasons — because his career is this driving thing with
 him’. She clearly managed to overcome her initial qualms, telling her 
priest friend in 1954: ‘I love being married much more than I did even 
in the beginning.’

If she 
was always forgiving of Jack, she wasn’t always quite so kind about his 
family. Father Leonard clearly provided an outlet for her to whisper the
 things she dared not say out loud.

She
 once wrote witheringly of her mother-in-law, Rose: ‘I don’t think 
Jack’s mother is too bright — and she would rather say a rosary than 
read a book.’

Newlyweds: The couple married in 1953. A year later, Jackie writes in a letter to Leonard: 'I love being married much more than I did even in the beginning'

The treasure 
trove lay undisturbed for 50 years in a safe at the priest’s former 
seminary, All Hallows College, in Dublin, until being discovered by 
chance by a visiting book valuation expert. Made available to the Irish 
Times, they are expected to fetch at least £1 million when they go up 
for sale next month.

Kennedy
 experts have been stunned by the haul. For while Mrs Kennedy was privy 
to some of the most extraordinary years in White House history, she 
refused to write a memoir or even give an interview in the last 30 years
 of her life.

Friends who 
betrayed her confidences were immediately ostracised. Father Leonard, it
 appears, may have been her only real confidant. ‘It’s so good in a way 
to write all this down and get it off your chest — because I never do 
really talk about it with anyone,’ she told him.

She
 was even ready to criticise God to him after JFK’s assassination in 
Dallas in 1963, revealing her anger at the Almighty for taking away the 
man she loved just months after the death of a son [Patrick], who lived 
for only two days.

Shaken faith: Jackie, pictured with her young children at JFK's funeral in November 1963, shares her heartbreak with Leonard, admitting that she had become 'bitter against God'

‘I am so
 bitter against God,’ she wrote in early 1964 on a letter on 
black-bordered paper. Soon, she wrote again, telling the now 86-year-old
 priest: ‘I feel more cruelly every day what I have lost — I always 
would have rather lost my life than lost Jack.’

But
 she didn’t want to raise their children ‘in a bitter way’. She added: 
‘God will have a bit of explaining to do to me if I ever see him.’

But
 she would keep praying, she said sadly, as ‘I have to think there is a 
God —  or I have no hope of finding Jack again’. It was one of her last 
letters to the priest, who died in the autumn of 1964. At his funeral, a
 bouquet of red roses lay on his coffin — sent by Mrs Kennedy.

As
 one might have expected with a priest and a practising Catholic, their 
correspondence had a religious aspect. Father Leonard sent her books 
about the lives of the saints and she admitted he had rekindled her 
interest in religion.

In 
early 1952, she wrote: ‘I terribly want to be a good Catholic now and I 
know it’s all because of you. I suppose I realised in the back of my 
mind you wanted that — you gave me the rosary as I left Ireland.’

Longstanding friendship: Father Leonard and Jackie, pictured in 1950 during their initial meeting, corresponded faithfully over the course of 14 years

She
 was so smitten with him that it got on JFK’s nerves when the two 
friends met a second time, this time on a visit by the Kennedys to 
Dublin in 1955. The couple and Father Leonard were guests at a dinner 
hosted by Declan Costello, son of the Irish prime minister and his 
glamorous wife Joan.

Jackie 
recalled in a letter to the priest: ‘Our happy marriage was nearly rent 
asunder because Jack was enchanted with Joan, and I was enchanted with 
you — but somehow we patched it all up at the movies.’

In
 letters, she addressed him as ‘Father L’, always signing off: ‘XO’. 
That, she felt she had to explain to the man of God, meant ‘hugs and 
kisses’. One particularly effusive letter ended: ‘Bushels, barrels, 
carts & lorry loads of love to YOU — Jacqueline XO’. Another 
finished with ‘XXX OOO’.

What
 was it about Father Leonard that so captivated the young American? The 
bon viveur and well-read cleric was certainly no ordinary Irish priest. 
He had spent much of his priesthood in London, teaching in a Catholic 
teacher-training college in Twickenham.

Jackie's men: Sitting with John F Kennedy just before they married in 1953

During
 World War I, he served as a British Army chaplain on the Western Front,
 an experience that left him partially deaf. In London, he moved in 
literary circles, counting playwright George Bernard Shaw among his 
friends. When he retired to Dublin, he was often visited by friends of a
 wealthy American couple he had befriended in London — including Mrs 
Kennedy.

Biographers of 
Jackie Kennedy have never realised the importance of Father Leonard to 
her. One biographer noted casually how she enjoyed the company of a 
priest who ‘embraced a joyous form of Christianity that saw no conflict 
between religious piety and enjoying the finer things in life’.

B 
 ut as Mrs Kennedy confided to Father Leonard, he was someone who ‘loves
 everything I love — who you can have FUN with . . . whom you can talk 
to about anything in the world and know you won’t shock them’.

We
 may never know exactly what he thought of her because his letters 
haven’t been found, but we can surmise her high opinion of him was 
reciprocated, although she reveals how he also accused her of being 
fickle, calling her a ‘girouette’, the French for weather-vane.

Perhaps
 he had in mind her revelation that she almost married someone else — a 
stockbroker named John Husted — with whom she was so ‘terribly much in 
love’ in 1952. And yet within months, she was confiding that she had 
fallen for another man, JFK, and her engagement to Husted was swiftly 
ended.

When Jackie Kennedy 
Onassis died in 1994, obituarists noted with regret that she had 
remained largely a mystery by keeping so silent about her past.

Now, thanks to an unlikely but firm friendship, the curtain has been pulled back a little.
