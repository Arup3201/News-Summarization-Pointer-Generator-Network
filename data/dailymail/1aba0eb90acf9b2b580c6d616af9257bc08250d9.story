Another witness who claimed Labour’s biggest funder was embroiled in vote-rigging is standing by her account – piling more pressure on Ed Miliband to reopen an inquiry into the scandal.

Michelle Hornall is one of several who claimed to have been signed up as Labour members without their knowledge by the union Unite.

The development came as a Tory MP reported Unite to the police for alleged intimidation in a dispute with the bosses of one of Britain’s leading oil refineries.

Ed Miliband, pictured in Edinburgh yesterday, is under increasing pressure to reopen an inquiry into Unite vote-rigging claims. At least two key witnesses insist they were signed up to Labour without their knowledge

The union deployed a squad to target senior staff of the Ineos chemical company and their families at their homes in a dispute over the Grangemouth plant.

Mr Miliband has shelved an inquiry into allegations that Unite ‘stitched up’ the Falkirk seat by signing up members to the party without their consent earlier this year, saying that a change of heart by two whistleblowers meant there was no longer enough evidence to prove the claims.

But on Monday, the Daily Mail revealed that Lorraine Kane, the whistleblower who first alleged she and her family had been signed up as Labour members without their consent, had rejected Unite claims that she had withdrawn her testimony.

Now Mrs Hornall, a member of Mrs Kane’s family, also maintains she was signed up to Labour by Stephen Deans – the chairman of the local constituency party and a Unite convener – without her consent and using her maiden name, which she has not used since she was 20. Mr Deans has since quit his union role.

Mrs Hornall has declined to speak 
directly about what happened to her, but her husband, Steven Hornall, 
said: ‘I think it is just going to drag on until it gets brushed under 
the carpet.’

He told The Times: ‘Stevie Deans has not even been in touch
 to see how they [members of his family] are doing.

'This is all one man’s doing and it is our family being harassed over it.'

But Mr Miliband said: ‘We’ve got very, very clear legal evidence from the people concerned about how that lady was signed up to the Labour Party.

‘What I’m saying to you is we’ve looked into all of the allegations that have been made, we’ve talked to that family and they’ve given us very, very clear evidence.’

Mr Miliband, who visited Scotland yesterday, said he agreed that ‘machine politics’ had been at work in Falkirk, but insisted he was satisfied there were no grounds for a second inquiry.

A Unite spokesman said last night: 'The Kane family are not and never have been Unite members. Unite therefore did not sign them up to the Labour Party, either through the union-join scheme that then existed, or otherwise.'

Late last month, police were called after Unite approached one executive’s neighbours, telling them he was 'evil', while the daughter of another had 'Wanted' posters denouncing her father posted through her letterbox.

Yesterday Conservative MP Priti Patel said the tactics of the union were unacceptable and asked detectives in Hampshire and Scotland to investigate whether they had been in breach of the law.
