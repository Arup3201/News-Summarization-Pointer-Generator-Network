Former head teacher James Stewart has been arrested over £40,000 of expenses claims 

The former head of a failing school has been arrested over £40,000 of expenses claims – including a wine club subscription and Virgin Media package for his home.

James Stewart, who made £120,000 a year as the academy's principal, was quizzed by police after a Government watchdog said he received £39,026 of 'irregular' payments. 

It said the sum included £25,544 spent on 'alcohol, hospitality, shopping, gift cards, home appliances/furnishings'.

Of this, £3,593.62 was 'directly attributable' to alcohol, including the wine club subscriptions.

Investigators said the 'potentially irregular expenditure' also included £2,934.84 in direct debits to mobile phone companies and to Virgin Media for a home package.

Mr Stewart, 69, quit as head of Sawtry Community College in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, in the summer after a critical Ofsted report which put the school in special measures.

He did not respond last night to a request for comment.
