Loss: Sabeen Thandi was strangled to death by Mohammed Badiuzzaman, who was arrested for threatening to kill her two weeks before she died

Police officers are under investigation after a man who was arrested for threatening to kill his pregnant wife was released and went on to murder her two weeks later.

Mohammed Badiuzzaman, 34, pleaded guilty to murdering mother-of-three Sabeen Thandi at the Old Bailey yesterday.

Police said he had become enraged after discovering she had entered into another relationship. It is not known who the father of her unborn child is.

Badiuzzaman, of Forest Gate, east London, forced his 37-year-old wife to wear a hijab after pressuring her into an Islamic marriage.

He forbade her from going out on her own even when she had to travel to work as a doctor's receptionist.

The security guard even tried to sell her home by visiting an estate agents and pretending he owned the property.

The couple had started dating in November 2012 and Badiuzzaman moved in with Ms Thandi two months later.

But she became fed up with his controlling behaviour and visited a solicitors in Watford in June because she wanted a divorce.

Ms Thandi was terrified of her abusive husband and feared for her and her children's safety.

On June 17 Watford County Court made a non-molestation order against Badiuzzaman banning him from entering his wife's home.

But two days later he forced her to drive to her lawyer's office to have the order revoked.

He threatened that if she did not do as he said she would 'never see her son again'.

Ms Thandi's solicitors phoned the police and Badiuzzaman was arrested on suspicion of threats to kill and unlawful imprisonment, but he was later released.

Police went to the house in Forest Gate in the early hours of July 7 last year after receiving a silent 999 call.

Badiuzzaman answered the door and told officers his wife was still at work, but when they searched the property they found her lifeless body under a duvet in the bedroom.

Ms Thandi was taken to Newham University Hospital where she was confirmed dead.

A post-mortem gave the cause of death as strangulation.

Officer in the case, Detective Inspector Euan McKeeve said: 'This tragedy has left three children without a loving mother in the prime of her life.'

Hertfordshire Police and the Met Police are now being investigated by the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) in relation to the incident.

An IPCC spokesperson said: 'The investigation is nearing conclusion, with most lines of enquiry completed by investigators.

'We have interviewed ten officers and a civilian staff member from the Metropolitan Police Service under misconduct caution, in relation to their contact with Mrs Thandi prior to her death on 7 July 2013.

'Two officers from Hertfordshire Constabulary have also been interviewed under misconduct caution, in relation to their contact with Mrs Thandi on 19 June 2013.

'We have also taken statements from several independent witnesses, and are keeping the family updated on the progress of our investigation.'

Badiuzzaman admitted murder and was remanded in custody ahead of sentence on May 27.
