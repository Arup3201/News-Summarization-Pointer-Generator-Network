An over-the-top instructional video has been released from a Homeland Security department on what to do if you are caught up in a mass shooting.

The six-minute tape, complete with pulsating soundtrack and blood spatter, advises that the best way to survive is follow three steps - run, hide or as a last resort, fight.

The clip was produced by the Houston Police Department in Alabama and published on November 5 by the state's Homeland Security department. It depicts the nightmare which unfolds as a sole gunman stalks employees in an office building.

Taking a stand: Although the video advises to run or hide from a gunman first, it then suggests with this dramatic scene that you fight - as these 'employees' do with a fire hydrant, chair, coffee pot and belt

Fear strikes: The instructional video from the Department of Homeland security in Alabama shows what to do if a gunman opens fire in a public space, like this office

Run for your life: The video first suggests that if you can escape the shooting you should do so but not to let colleagues 'slow you down'

The melodramatic video has attracted a flurry of comments on YouTube about gun control and a variety of survival tips.

As the clip begins, a voice-over says: 'It may feel like another day at the office but occasionally, life feels like an action movie.'

The camera then cuts between office workers happily chatting, working at their desks and answering phones to a man dressed in black, wearing sunglasses and carrying a backpack.  

The voice reminds members of the public: 'You have to be prepared for the worst.'

The graphic content then shows the man in black removing a shotgun from his backpack and opening fire on a crowded reception area as employees drop to the ground, blood spraying across walls and people running away screaming.

Desperate: An employee who escaped the building pleads with a passer-by for the use of his phone in the clip

Turn out the lights: One woman hides in the dark behind the photocopier as a shooter roams the halls in the safety video

Terror: The gunman tries doors in the office building as employees hide

The voice-over continues: 'If you are ever to find yourself in the middle of an active shooter event, your survival may depend on whether or not you have a plan.'

The Homeland Security video suggests that there are three options for those caught up in the terrifying situation - run, hide, fight.

The clip then shows several employees darting between office cubicles to find an escape route. However, the video reminds the public that although they should help others - 'don't let them slow you down with indecision'.

Back in the building, other employees crouch behind tables and photocopiers, locking doors and turning off lights as screams and gunshots ring out.

Hysteria: An actress weeps in the gun safety video for the Alabama Homeland Security Department

Flee: Actors playing office workers made a dramatic bid for freedom in the video

Drama unfolds: Employees gather in front of a fire truck following their terrifying ordeal

In
the final scene, a group of trapped employees decide to 'fight' as one 
woman cries hysterically. The others arm themselves with a chair, fire 
hydrant, coffee pot and leather belt as the gunman bursts in.

At the end of the instructional video, shaken employees gather around a fire truck as the life-saving instructions flash across the screen once more. 

The video, which appears on Alabama's Department of Homeland Security website, was posted on YouTube on November 5.

It comes with the disclaimer: 'An individual must use his/her own discretion during an active shooter event as to whether he/she chooses to run to safety or remain in place.'

There has been a spate of deadly shootings across the U.S. this year culminating in the tragedy at Sandy Hook elementary school on December 14 where 20 children and six teaching staff were killed.

To the rescue: Armed police arrive at the end of the safety video

Three life-saving steps: The video, made by Houston police department in Alabama, first advises those caught up in a shooting to flee

Follow orders: The second piece of advice, if you can't escape, is to keep out of sight

Last resort: If there is no other possibility, the department of Homeland Security suggests you commit to fighting the gunman
