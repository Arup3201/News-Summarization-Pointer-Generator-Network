The records just keep tumbling for Cristiano Ronaldo at Real Madrid.

After his strike against Rayo Vallecano, the Portuguese forward now has 300 goals for Los Blancos, despite having played in Madrid for only six seasons, amassing 288 appearances.

He has well and truly made his name as a legend at the Santiago Bernabeu, only trailing Raul and Alfredo di Stefano in the club standings.

Ronaldo heads home his 300th goal for the club - against Rayo Vallecano at the Vallecas Stadium in Madrid

323 - Raul

308 - Alfredo di Stefano

300 - Cristiano Ronaldo

289 - Carlos Santillana

242 - Ferenc Puskas 

Ronaldo has scored 206 with his right foot, 52 with his left, even managing 41 with his head. 46 of his goals at Real have been outside the box, many of them screamers.

After claiming two FIFA Ballon d'Or awards during his time in Spain, as well as glory in La Liga and the Champions League, many would be running out of motivation, scratching around for more records to break.

But Ronaldo, 30, doesn't only have the status of Raul or Di Stefano to look up to, but also Barcelona rival Lionel Messi, who is younger, and seemingly still improving.

But there are other poachers that have formed their goalscoring reputation at one club, including a Portugal legend and an Everton hero who the former Manchester United man could draw inspiration from.

THE TOP 10 ONE-CLUB SCORERS OF ALL TIME 

10) Dixie Dean, Everton (1925-37) 

383

Dean is the widely regarded as greatest player to have been born on Merseyside, and scored 60 goals in one league season in 1927/28. Impressed? He achieved that record after fracturing his skull and jaw in a motorcycling accident.

Former Everton striker Dixie Dean is widely regarded as the greatest striker ever born on Merseyside

9) Willy van der Kuijlen, PSV (1964-81)

394  

When his career started in Eindhoven, part of Der Kuijlen's motivation was to work at Phillips. He ended up with almost 400 goals, and was still only capped 22 times by the Dutch national side.

8) Lionel Messi, Barcelona (2004-present) 

398* 

Staggeringly, this Argentine forward is only 27. As the star of a mightily impressive Barelona team, expect Messi to climb up this list considerably over the next 10 years.

Lionel Messi is closing in on the 400 mark with Barcelona and should rapidly rise up the scoring charts

7) Zico, Flamengo (1971-83 and 1985-89)

401 

An attacking midfielder in the top 10? Often called the 'White Pele', Zico encapsulated a fine generation of Brazilian football, and impressed with his club side in his homeland. Over two spells with Flamengo, it's no wonder he was given a prestigious nickname.

6) Eusebio, Benfica (1960-75) 

474

Eusebio helped Benfica to 11 league titles and seven more domestic trophies, as well as four European Cup finals. Not just a poacher, Eusebio had it all and the Mozambique-born player was a Portuguese football legend.

5) Uwe Seeler, Hamburg (1953-72)

507 

Up there with Gerd Muller and Franz Beckenbauer as a German great, Seeker was not a giant but a very strong player with fantastic shooting and heading abilities. His tally probably proves that.

Uwe Seeler scored over 500 goals for Hamburg and is up there with Franz Beckenbauer as a German great

4) Jimmy McGrory, Celtic (1922-37) 

522

Regarded as the Hoops' finest ever player, McGrory netted 55 hat-tricks for the club and went on to rewrite the football record books with his unbelievable scoring feats.

3) Josef Bican, Slavia Prague (1937-48)

534 

Slavia were one of the biggest clubs in the pre-war era, led by a striker from a poor family, brought up in Austria. He fled to Czechoslovakia during the second world war, and certainly made his mark.

2) Gerd Muller, Bayern Munich (1964-79)

573 

Muller scored an incredible 85 goals in a single season as Bayern Munich claimed the Bundesliga title in 1972, and was the league's top scorer on seven occasions. Muller spent 13 campaigns with the Bavarian giants and with his goalscoring record, it's no wonder to see him near the top of the charts.

Gerd Muller (centre) scored 85 goals in one league season with Bayern Munich and netted 573 in total

1) Pele, Santos (1956-74)

1088 

Though his official record stands at 643 goals for Brazilian side Santos, and the 1088 includes strikes against a military XI, Pele tops the charts. Is he the best player of all-time, too?

Pele unofficially scored 1088 goals for Santos and is widely regarded as the best player of all-time

228 - Thierry Henry (1999-2007 and 2012)

Thierry Henry enjoyed a prolific eight-year spell with Arsenal and is the club's all-time top goalscorer
