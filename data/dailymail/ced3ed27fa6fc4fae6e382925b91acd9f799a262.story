More than 1,200 additional police officers took to the streets last night amid heightened fears of further violence targeted at the Muslim community by far-Right groups.

Officers were guarding 'key locations' in  London, including religious venues and transport hubs, Metropolitan Police assistant commissioner Mark Rowley said.

Leave for officers has been cancelled following ugly scenes in Woolwich involving the  English Defence League and a spate of attacks on mosques elsewhere in England on Wednesday night.

English Defence League supporters clashed with police near Woolwich Arsenal railway station just hours after the bloody attack on Lee Rigby. A group of around 250 men gathered at The Queen's Arms pub in Burrage Road, where they sang nationalist songs.

The mob then began throwing missiles at police officers, who responded with baton charges, witnesses said.

Elsewhere, a 43-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of attempted arson and possession of an offensive weapon after walking into a mosque with a knife and an explosive device in Braintree, Essex.

The secretary of the mosque, Sikander Saleemy, said it was 'some sort of revenge attack'. He added: 'We absolutely condemn what happened in Woolwich, but it had nothing to do with us.

'It was an appalling act of terror – but it wasn't Islamic in any way. I wish it wasn't described like that, because sadly people will now start to blame Muslims.'

Another man was arrested for racially aggravated criminal damage at a mosque in Gillingham on Wednesday, and eggs were thrown at the Islamic centre in Lewisham, south-east London.

In Bolton, a mosque was vandalised with slogans such as 'Islam = evil' and 'terrorist training camp'.

David Cameron said Britain would be 'absolutely resolute in its stand against violent extremism and terror'.

He added: 'We will never give in to terror – or terrorism – in any of its forms. This view is shared by every community in our country.'

EDL leader Stephen Lennon said: 'They're chopping our soldiers' heads off. This is Islam. That's what we've seen.

'Our next generation are being taught through schools that Islam is a religion of peace. It's not. It never has been.

'What you saw is Islam. Everyone's had enough. There has to be a reaction, for the Government to listen, for the police to listen, to understand how angry the British public are.'
