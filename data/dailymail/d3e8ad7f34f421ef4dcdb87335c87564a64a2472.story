The heartbroken parents of a 14-year-old boy murdered by an 'online predator' are suing two police forces they say failed to stop his killing.

Breck Bednar was brutally stabbed to death by Lewis Daynes, an older teenager he met playing violent computer games on the internet.

Breck's parents Barry Bednar and Lorin LaFave went to police in Surrey two months before his killing and told them he was being groomed by an older man over the internet.

After Daynes pleaded guilty to the murder yesterday, it emerged the couple are now suing Surrey Police and Essex Police over their handling of the case.

Breck is believed to have met Daynes when he joined an online gaming group  run by the older teenager.

His parents, who are from the US but live in Caterham, Surrey, raised the alarm after noticing a change in the once committed student's behaviour. They went to police in December last year, two months before Breck's murder in February this year.

After his death, his mother said: 'Like most teenagers, socialising, computers and games were what he enjoyed.

'The problem was a predator who was trying to control his ideology about religion, government, family and education.

'Breck looked up to him because of his interesting manner and computer skills. Breck couldn't see the bad and when I pointed out his obvious lies, they were overlooked by Breck, his friends and, unfortunately, the police.'

The family believe that despite their pleas, no action was taken by Surrey Police to prevent Daynes carrying out his crime. The family also accuse Essex Police of failing to share information with Surrey Police in relation to the case.

Surrey Police is also being investigated by the Independent Police Complaints Commission over the murder.

An Essex Police spokesman said: 'Essex Police have been notified of a civil claim against the force and it would be inappropriate to comment further at this time.'

Assistant Chief Constable Gavin Stephens, of Surrey police, said that since the murder the force had reviewed its call-handling procedures and implemented changes to improve the way information was handled and shared.

He said: 'This has been a tragic case and our thoughts remain with Breck's friends and family. In December 2013 a call was made to Surrey police by a relative of Breck expressing concerns around online grooming, and due to the prior contact the case was referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission.

'They have since decided to conduct an independent investigation into the actions taken by Surrey police following this communication. We will fully cooperate with the ongoing investigation.'

Breck told his parents he was going to a sleepover with friends before travelling to Daynes' flat in Grays, Essex (pictured), where he was stabbed in the neck in a 'sexually or sadistically motivated' attack
