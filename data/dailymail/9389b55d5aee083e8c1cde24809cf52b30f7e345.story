New Orleans police are searching for two people wanted in the kidnapping of a toddler girl in the back seat of a car stolen last week from a downtown gas station.

The assailants, both black males, were in another stolen car Wednesday night when they pulled into the Shell station just before 10.30 p.m. and one jumped out and stole the car with the baby inside, surveillance video showed.

The tot was dumped on a nearby sidewalk and scooped up by a good Samaritan, according to police, but neither the stolen cars nor the suspects have been found.

Police called the theft a ‘crime of opportunity’ in comments to WVUE, and said the toddler’s father leaving the windshield wipers and headlights on led the thief to make off with his black Infiniti G35.

‘Who would get out and run into a gas station and leave your car running? More so, who would leave their child inside of a car? So, this is something that may have and could have been prevented if somebody had just taken a little more precaution,’ said NOPD Commander Robert Bardy.

‘Never leave your child alone in a car that's running. First and foremost, that's one thing you don't want to do,’ added Retired NOPD Sgt. Michael LeVasseur.

Video shows the father walking inside the gas station as the thieves roll into another pump in a stolen Chrysler PT Cruiser.  

The theft: He is seen here opening the door to the Inifiniti, the car's headlights and windshield wipers are noticeably on when the occupant is inside the store

The switch: The man circled was the passenger in the stolen PT Cruiser, he walks around to the front of the car while the other thief drives the Infiniti from the station (bottom left corner)

The driver of Chrysler then gets out and runs over to the Infiniti while his passenger casually exits the car and hops behind the wheel.

The black male quickly drives the Infiniti away and the Chrysler follows close behind.The whole theft took less than 10 seconds.

‘This is a crime of opportunity, and it's something that we as citizens should be more aware of, Bardy explained.

Police sources said the Chrysler was similarly stolen from a Valero gas station only one block away.

‘It's reported to us that a gentleman had exited his car at Wagner's Market right down on Claiborne and Martin Luther King, and then he went to the back to check his tire, and somebody got in his car. The car was left running,’ Bardy recalled.

The car thief soon dumped the young child on a bleak street corner marked by a concrete wall and crooked fencing around a home abandoned after being damaged in Hurricane Katrina, said police.

Where it happened: The Shell gas station where the brazen theft occurred

Desolate: The nearly-abandoned block where the baby was found by a good samaritan before being brought to a local police station

The person brought the girl to a nearby police station where she was reunited with her father, cops said.

It is not clear if the father will face neglect charges for leaving the tot in the car, but police told the station they will take that into consideration after the more serious crime is solved.

Both cars are still missing. The black 2003 Infinty G35 has Louisiana plate XXM725 and the red PT Cruiser has Louisiana plate XTF472.
