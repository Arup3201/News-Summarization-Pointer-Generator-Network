The former employee who is suing TV chef Paula Deen and her brother Bubba Hiers for sexual harassment and racism has a checkered financial past, according to reports.

Lisa Jackson, who worked for the siblings at their co-owned restaurant in Savannah, Georgia, has owed a total of $63,948 in Georgia state taxes and federal taxes dating from 2001 to 2005.

But, while she may be accused of using the explosive lawsuit as a way to make fast cash, RadarOnline.com added that nearly all the tax liens have been settled or released.

Yet it could throw doubt on the claims made by Ms Jackson, 48, who filed a lawsuit in Georgia claiming the working conditions at Uncle Bubba's Seafood and Oyster House were intolerable.

The former general manager claimed Bubba brought 
'inescapable pornography' to the workplace, cracked sexist jokes and 
told Lisa to bring in photos of herself when she was younger, telling 
her 'you've got nice legs'.

Jackson, who worked at the restaurant
between 2005 and 2010, also accuses the duo of racism, and cites 
examples of their use of the term n*****.

In
one, she explains Deen appointed her to handle the catering and staff 
for Bubba's 2007 wedding and she asked Deen what the servers should 
wear.

'Well
what I would really like is a bunch of little n******s to wear 
long-sleeve white shirts, black shorts and black bow ties,' Jackson 
claimed Deen said, according to RadarOnline.com.

She continued: 'You know in the Shirley Temple days, they used to tap dance around.

'Now, that would be a true Southern wedding wouldn't it? But we can't do that because the media would be on me about that.'

In another example, the lawsuit writes that in front of several employees, Bubba said 'they should send President Obama to the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico so he could n******-rig it'.

In
a third example of racism, the suit claims that black employees had to 
use a restroom at the back of the restaurant, while white employees 
could share the customer restroom.

Jackson
joined the restaurant after the previous general manager, who was male,
was fired for having sexual relations with the servers.

Deen allegedly said in a meeting: 'If 
you think I have worked this hard to lose everything because of a piece 
of p****y, you better think again.

'And now I'm going to do something I have never done - I am going to put a woman in a man's job.'

Former employee Lisa Jackson claims that Bubba Hiers and Paula Deen made a number of sexist and racist remarks. They include:

Paula: (on wedding catering) 'What I would really like is a bunch 
of little n******s to wear long-sleeve white shirts, black shorts and 
black bow ties. Now, that would be a true Southern wedding wouldn't it?'

Bubba: 'They should send President Obama to the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico so he could n******-rig it'

Paula: 'I'm going to do something I have never done - I am going to put a woman in a man's job'

Bubba: (telling Jackson to bring in photographs of herself) 'You have nice legs'

Although Jackson excelled in the job - 
doubling profits - she claims the working environment was fraught with 
sexism, and complained that Bubba would regularly watch porn in their 
shared office.

'Bubba Hiers is a frequent customer of pornography web sites and would download and view such sites at work.

In
the small office he shared with Jackson, it was impossible for her to 
avoid the pornography,' the lawsuit states, according to 
RadarOnline.com.

At a weekly manager's meeting, Bubba allegedly took along a paper copy of an email entitled 'Why gay marriage should be legal'.

It showed pictures of women having sex with women, and was passed around the table.

'No outrage was expressed and no action was taken in response to his behavior,' the suit states.

As
well as the sexist comments, which the suit notes were directed at more
than one employee, Jackson claims there were other sickening goings-on 
at the restaurant.

Empire: Deen recently came under fire for not disclosing she was diagnosed with diabetes three years ago

She claims Bubba told her that two women
at the restaurant were 'fat girls' who shouldn't be wearing skirts, and
he allegedly kissed her and spat on her, TMZ reported.

Jackson eventually quit in 2010 because of the conditions and is suing for unspecified damages.

She claims that her complaint of sexual harassment and other concerns fell on deaf ears.

It
will come as more bad news for Paula Deen, who recently came under fire
for revealing she has had Type 2 diabetes - a condition associated with
diet - for three years.

Fellow
chefs lambasted her decision to keep the diagnosis quiet, claiming that
Deen, whose dishes are often deep-fried or coated in butter, had a 
responsibility to tell the truth about the potential effects of her 
recipes.
