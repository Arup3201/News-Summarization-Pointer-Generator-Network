Tommy Hilfiger has worked in the fashion industry since the tender age of 17, but it seems he is finally ready for a change of scenery.

In the latest issue of Haute Living New York, the 62-year-old fashion mogul strikes a pose with his wife and muse, 46-year-old Dee, as he jokes that he's 'sick of fashion'.

He says of his decades in the industry: 'I've been doing it for too long,' adding: 'My real passion is flipping houses.'

Happy couple: In the latest issue of Haute Living New York, Tommy Hilfiger strikes a pose with his wife and muse, 46-year-old Dee, in their Greenwich, Connecticut home as he jokes that he's 'sick of fashion'

The designer was referring to his sprawling property in Greenwich, Connecticut, which he and his wife have been renovating for the past few months.

The photo shoot sees the designer getting cosy in his temporary home with his wife of five years, a former model, whom he says is also his muse.

'Every time we do a collection I think about what would look good on her, what she would wear and how she would wear it,' Mr Hilfiger explains.

Dee may inspire him now, but the 
designer goes on to confess that there was a time when he let trends get in the way of
his personal aesthetic, much to the chagrin of his customers.

'In the Nineties I was chasing the modern minimalist trend,' he recalls in the interview. 'So I 
tried to make the line more modern and sleek.'

'Every time we do a collection I think about what would look good on Dee, how she'd wear it'

But the design change backfired. 'My customers completely 
pushed back,' he says. 'They really wanted to stay with preppy, colorful, cool 
designs. It was hard to rebound from that.

'Luckily I made the mistake and
came back to who I really am,' added the father-of-five.

Judging by the photo shoot, Mr Hilfiger and his wife are more than just an artist and his muse.

Inspiration: 'Every time we do a collection I think about what would look good on her, what she would wear and how she would wear it,' Mr Hilfiger said of his wife of five years

The couple look happy and in-love as they pose on a sofa, in a sailboat and next to a vintage car together.

But the chemistry wasn't always so evident between the pair; indeed, Mrs Hilfiger reveals that when she was first introduced to the designer in St Tropez in 2005, she assumed he was gay.

Sparks flew shortly thereafter, however, when the pair bonded over a cause that is close to both of their hearts: autism.

'Love at second sight': The couple look happy and in-love in the images, but Mrs Hilfiger revealed that when she was first introduced to the designer in St Tropez in 2005, she assumed he was gay

'We both have children from our prior marriages on the autism spectrum so that was one of the things we bonded over,' explained Dee, whose two teenage sons are from her first marriage to Italian tennis player Gianni Ocleppo.

The couple have since collaborated on fundraisers and public service announcements, and share projects and ideas with each other. 'It was love at second sight,' jokes Dee.

'The smartest business decision I ever made was to find a niche in the market and stick to it'

Though the designer sold the Tommy Hilfiger Corporation to Phillips-Van Heusen in 2010, he still maintains control over the brand's distinctive, all-American designs.

'The smartest business decision I ever made was to find a niche in the market and stick to it over a long period of time,' he told the magazine.

'The second smartest was to bring in great partners,' he said. 'It was like a band - you needed a guitarist, a drummer, a bass player and a singer.'

Past mistakes: Dee may inspire him now, but the designer confessed there was a time when he let trends get in the way of his personal aesthetic, much to the chagrin of his customers

Despite his long-running success, however, Mr Hilfiger still sometimes gets mistaken for his fellow designer, Ralph Lauren.

In the magazine, he recounts one time when a man came up to him in a restaurant
to tell him he had just bought 'a bunch of shirts' at his store.

The man apparently told him: 'That's all I wear. I love your shirts. . .
I love the horse,' referring to the animal logo on Ralph Lauren 
apparel.

Instead of correcting him, Mr Hilfiger - who admits he has gotten used to the comparison ever since he began letting his hair go white - says he 'smiled politely, and said, "Oh, thank you very much."'
