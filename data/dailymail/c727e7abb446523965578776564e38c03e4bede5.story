Star: Lionel Messi has been summoned to appear in a Spanish court over tax fraud allegations

The world's best football player has been summoned to appear in a Spanish court over tax fraud allegations.

Lionel Messi, who plays for Argentina and Barcelona, will appear before a judge on September 17.

The four-time World Player of
the Year has been accused of defrauding £3.4million through false income tax returns in Spain.

The state prosecutor has taken action against the footballer and his father, Jorge Horacio Messi.

Both are accused of three offences against the public purse for allegedly defrauding millions on income tax returns for 2007, 2008 and 2009.

The complaint, signed by prosecutor Raquel Amado, was previously submitted for trial at the court in Gava, the upmarket Barcelona suburb where the Argentina forward lives.

A judge must accept the prosecutor's lawsuit before charges can be brought against Messi and his father.

The footballing star released a statement denying any wrongdoing once the allegations emerged.

Reports emerged last week alleging the four-time reigning World Player of the Year and his father, Jorge Horacio, were suspected of filing fraudulent tax returns between 2007 and 2009.

The 25-year-old swiftly insisted he had done nothing wrong in a statement on his official Facebook page.

It read: 'We have just known through the media about the claim filed by the Spanish tax authorities.

'We are surprised about the news, because we have never committed any infringement.

Messi, pictured here with girlfriend Antonella Roccuzzo, issued a statement last week  saying 'we have always fulfilled all our tax obligations'

'We have always fulfilled all our tax
obligations, following the advice of our tax consultants, who will take
care of clarifying this situation.'

Messi
arrived at the Nou Camp as a 13-year-old in 2000, made his first-team 
debut three years later and has gone on to establish himself as one of 
football's best ever players.

He
has won six Primera Division titles, three Champions League crowns and 
two FIFA Club World Cups with the Catalan giants, and in 2012 netted a 
record 86 goals for club and country.

He signed a two-year contract extension with Barcelona in February which keeps him at the club through June 2018 - when he will be 31.

He joined Barcelona when he was 13, and made his debut with the first team three years later.

Spain has been cracking down on tax evasion as it fights to repair the country's public finances amid recession and the collapse of its once-booming real estate sector.

Finance Minister Cristobal Montoro warned footballers in April they should make sure they are 'comfortable' with their tax affairs. 

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
