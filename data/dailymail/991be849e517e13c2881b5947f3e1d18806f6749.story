The head of the Army has demanded a huge drive to recruit more ethnic minority and women soldiers.

General Sir Peter Wall said military chiefs had been ‘unsuccessful’ at ensuring the forces reflected the make-up of British society.

The Chief of the General Staff said the Army could reach full strength only by getting better at recruiting from ethnic communities, who make up 29 per cent of young people of fighting age, and women.

The country’s top soldier said: ‘For a long time we have been trying to get the balance in the Army across the piece, including female soldiers, more in kilter with the make-up of British society.

‘We have made strenuous efforts in the past to correct this imbalance, without startling success.

‘Those who are serving from different ethnicities in the Army are making a huge contribution on a day-to-day basis and on operations. We need to acquire more of them.’

In December, the Royal Navy broke with 100 years of tradition to allow women to serve on submarines for the first time.

General Wall says there could be significant ‘side benefits’ from boosting recruitment, especially from Muslim communities and places from where there is a terror threat.

The Army was ‘very proud’ of soldiers from foreign and Commonwealth countries who had joined up, but recruitment ‘at home’ was vital to ensure the force was at full strength.

General Wall’s comments to a conference organised by the Royal United Services Institute think-tank, echoed those made last month by Philip Hammond when he indicated regiments with significant numbers of soldiers from Commonwealth countries would be abolished or merged.

The Defence Secretary said the most vulnerable units were those that failed to recruit their full  complement of soldiers in Britain and made up their numbers from Fiji and the Caribbean.

The Army will be downsized from 102,000 personnel to 82,000 by 2020 in an effort to cut costs.

The Ministry of Defence will inform another 2,900 soldiers as early as next Tuesday that they are to be axed, shrinking Army numbers to 97,000 – their lowest since the Crimean War. About 1,000 posts will be axed in the RAF and 300 in the Navy.

Tory MP Bob Stewart, a former commander of British troops in Bosnia, warned the cuts would see the Army reduced to little more than a home guard.

He said: ‘An Army used to be defined by being 100,000-strong. If it is less than that, some people argue it is a self-defence force. We will certainly carry less clout in the world.’

Mr Hammond is poised for a bitter backlash over plans to slash the number of Army regiments.

The last cavalry regiment in Wales, the 1st Battalion The Queen’s Dragoon Guards, has already launched a campaign to save itself from the chop.

Ray Scanlon, whose son Richard, 31, died in Afghanistan serving with the unit, said: ‘My son would turn in his grave if he could know what was going on and be doing the same as me – standing up to bureaucracy, standing up for Welsh life.’

Labour defence spokesman Jim Murphy accused Mr Hammond of ‘presiding over decline, not planning for the future’. He said: ‘The Government plans to plug self-made capability gaps rather than reform our forces for the future.’
