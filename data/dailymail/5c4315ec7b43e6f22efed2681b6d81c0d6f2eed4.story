A site believed to be used to travellers close to the holiday resort where Madeleine McCann disappeared is being investigated by police leading the probe into her disappearance, it has been claimed.

According to reports, detectives from Scotland Yard are carrying out investigations at a site in Meia Praia, situated seven miles from the holiday apartment in Praia da Luz where Madeleine disappeared from in May 2007.

Earlier this month the Mail exclusively revealed Scotland Yard had identified three burglars as prime suspects.

One theory is that the burglars raided the McCanns’ flat and were panicked into snatching the youngster when she woke up.

Analysis of mobile phone data suggests the men were close to the scene of her abduction, at the time she went missing, and were in close contact in the hours that followed.

Last week it was reported the three suspects had worked at the resort where Madeleine disappeared.

Details of the men’s alleged links to the Ocean Club resort in the Algarve were revealed in Portuguese newspapers with close contacts with local police.

According to The Sun, officers are now also understood to be investigating a site in the area of Meia Praia along with another site 30 miles away.

A Briton who has a holiday home near where the McCann family stayed in Praia da Luz told the paper officers from Scotland Yard had asked him about Meia Praia.

He said: 'They wanted to know everything that I knew about the people living there.'

Meia Praia is also believed to be home to a group of fishermen who moved into the area about 40 years ago.

Scotland Yard were unable to confirm reports of the two sites being investigated.
