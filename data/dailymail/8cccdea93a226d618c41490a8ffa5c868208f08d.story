And then there were none. English football’s worst European campaign in more than 20 years is now complete. Appropriately, given what went before, it ended with a humiliation.

It had been a theme of the season for Everton to provide hope in Europe after poor Champions League results but not this time. Things spectacularly unravelled against Dynamo Kiev and Roberto Martinez looked haunted as the reality of this 5-2 slaying sank in.

Yes, Dynamo were superb but they were assisted by abominable defending. Martinez had complained a punishing fixture list is compromising the ambitions of Barclays Premier League teams but fatigue had nothing to do with this night of high farce.

Everton conceded five times and were fortunate not to ship another three or four, as Dynamo ruthlessly exposed their naivety. As a result, there will be no English representation in a European quarter-final for the first time since 1992/93. 

To stand any hope of progressing, it was imperative for Everton to take the sting out of the contest early on and, more importantly, quieten an excitable home crowd that had whipped themselves into a frenzy long before kick-off.

Instead, they performed like complete novices. They looked shaky from the first moment on a bare and bobbly pitch, with some players anonymous and others not up to the task. They needed to be tight and compact but they were open and exposed, inviting the hosts on to them.

Eventually, Dynamo took advantage. Andrei Yarmolenko had made an impression on Everton’s players with his style and grace in the first leg and he opened the scoring with a quite brilliant goal, bending in a 25-yard drive that flashed past Tim Howard.

The execution of the strike was magnificent but, on the touchline, Martinez stood aghast. Why, the manager must have been wondering, was a player of his Yarmolenko’s quality allowed to run 20 yards without anyone making a tackle?

It was the moment that sparked the game to life and for 10 minutes, the two teams began trading blows like boxers going through the gears. First Ross Barkley hit the post; Dynamo responded with Yarmolenko testing Howard.

Everton roared back and had rattled the hosts with a brilliant effort from Romelu Lukaku, the Belgian scoring the 100th goal of his career with a bending left-footed effort from the edge of the area after seizing on a loose ball. It should have given them a platform from which to build.

Not a bit of it. Dynamo went through the gears and ripped into Everton with a spell that left Martinez and his players bewildered and broken. So bad was Everton’s play, you sensed Dynamo could score every time they got within shooting distance. 

Lukasz Teodorczyk made the aggregate all square in the 34th minute, nipping in front of Antolin Alcaraz to smash past the stranded Howard. As he wheeled away gleefully, followed by his ecstatic team-mates, a number of Evertonian heads started to drop. This was the key moment.

For the first time since the Premier League's inaugural season there is no English club in a European quarter-final. Here's how each fared.

Liverpool, (February 26, Europa League last 32): After finishing third in their Champions League group, the Reds were knocked out by Besiktas on penalties.

Tottenham (February 26, Europa League last 32): Knocked out by Fiorentina after a 2-0 defeat in the second leg.

Chelsea (March 11, Champions League last 16): Came a cropper against 10-man Paris Saint-Germain in extra time.

Arsenal (March 17, Champions League last 16): Knocked out on the away goals rule despite a 2-0 win in Monaco.

Manchester City (March 18, Champions League last 16): English champions beaten home and away by Barcelona.

Everton (March 19, Europa League last 32): Thumped 5-2 by Kiev in Ukraine.

Sensing they could kill the contest, Dynamo swarmed forward and in the next attack, they scored again. This time Miguel Veloso profited from another defensive mix-up, his shot taking a slight deflection off Seamus Coleman on its way past Howard.

For a club that has a chant about how they will “fight, fight, fight with all their might” for the Royal Blue jersey, the way in which Everton collapsed was staggering. They lost their shape and lost their heart and were fortunate not to concede a fourth before the interval. How had it come to this?

Half-time should have given Martinez a chance to unscramble the senses, to make changes and give Everton clarity but, for some reason, he chose not to make any substitutions and Dynamo simply re-emerged to pin them back on the ropes. This pummelling was not about to stop.

Dynamo made sure of a place in the last eight in the 56th minute when Oleg Gusev converted from close range but, again, there were more shambolic errors.

Belatedly, Martinez called for replacements, Leon Osman and Arouna Kone coming on for Steven Naismith and Christian Atsu, but by then it was too late. Dynamo were swaggering and about to crown their display in spectacular fashion.

Antunes delivered it, unleashing a 35-yard missile with his left foot that arrowed past the helpless Howard. The execution was breath-taking but, somewhat fittingly, he was given all the time in the world to pick his spot. Why were Everton going to make a tackle now?

Eventually, Everton stemmed the tide and scored another of their own, with Phil Jagielka glancing in a Leighton Baines corner, but this was no consolation. It should only have reminded Everton of the opportunity they had squandered and how careless they had been.

At the final whistle, they trudged over apologetically to the fans who had made the long journey from Merseyside, the embarrassment finally at end. It was a dreadful way for an adventure that had brought such excitement to conclude. On this evidence, it will be some time before they return.
