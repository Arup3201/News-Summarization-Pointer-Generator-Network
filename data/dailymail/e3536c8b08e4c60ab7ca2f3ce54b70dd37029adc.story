He won an Oscar for writing about Shakespeare In Love – and now  Sir Tom Stoppard is in the same situation himself.

The 76-year-old father of four,  who is regarded as Britain’s greatest living dramatist, is to marry Sabrina Guinness, the brewery heiress who was once romantically linked to Prince Charles.

Sir Tom and Sabrina got engaged several weeks ago and have just started to share their news with their close friends.

One acquaintance, who asked not to be named, said: ‘Tom is the great love of Sabrina’s life and she could not be happier. She thinks he is the kindest, most wonderful man in the world and they are both beyond happy and thrilled.

‘Sabrina has shown the ring to some of her friends and all I will  say about it is that there are a lot  of diamonds. But the couple are not shouting about their engagement from the rooftops and some of their closest friends still don’t know.’

The couple, described as being ‘passionately in love’, began their relationship in secret, but it was confirmed when they sent out joint Christmas cards last year.

In recent months they have been increasingly seen together in public, and in May, Guinness accompanied Stoppard to a lunch hosted by the Queen for members of the Order  of Merit. The playwright is one of just 24 members.

Sir Tom’s friends say the relationship has breathed new life into his writing and the couple now plan to start a new life together in Dorset.

He is believed to be working on a new novel and his first new stage play since the West End hit Rock ’N’ Roll in 2006. Sir Tom is also understood to be working on a stage adaptation of Shakespeare In Love.

He has been married twice before and over the years his private life has become inseparable from his public persona.

His rise to fame on the back of Rosencrantz And Guildenstern Are Dead – which was first performed at the 1966 Edinburgh Fringe – was blamed for the collapse of his seven-year marriage to Josie Ingle in 1972, as she was said to resent living in his shadow.

His second marriage, to agony aunt Dr Miriam Stoppard, lasted 20 years but ended when he began a public affair with The Good Life actress Felicity Kendal.

They had a seven-year relationship before she returned to her husband. Stoppard’s 1982 play The Real Thing, is about a middle-aged playwright who becomes infatuated with an actress, originally played by Kendal.

Ms Guinness, a charity entrepreneur who is 19 years Stoppard’s junior, is one of the best connected people in the world, counting everyone from U2 to the Rothschilds among her friends

Her sister Julia Samuel is a godmother to Prince George – and when Sabrina dated Prince Charles in his bachelor days, he was reportedly much taken by her willowy legs and bubbly warmth.

Sir Tom and Sabrina did not want to comment last night.
