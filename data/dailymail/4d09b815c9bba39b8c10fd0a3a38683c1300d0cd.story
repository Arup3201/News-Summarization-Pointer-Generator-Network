Actor Robson Green has hit out at celebrities who avoid paying tax and he believes that they should ‘hang their heads in shame’.

Green said he was proud to be a top-rate taxpayer and condemned those who have sought to shelter their earnings from HM Revenue and Customs.

Speaking to Radio Times, he said: ‘Anybody who tells me they’re not going to pay tax… we’ve got an NHS system on its knees…  

Extreme fisherman Robson Green hates celebrities who avoid paying their full rate of tax

'I tell you what, my son was in real trouble when he was young and we took him to the hospital, there were four specialists waiting for him. That’s why you pay your taxes.

‘We’ve got a police system who protect us, we’ve got firemen who put out fires. We’ve got defence, man. That’s what tax is for.’

Jimmy Carr put his hands up to using a Jersey-based tax scheme called K2 two years ago

The former Soldier Soldier star and chart-topping singer - who appears in the upcoming ITV drama Grantchester - singled out comedian Jimmy Carr who was found to have used a Jersey-based tax scheme called K2 two years ago.

Green, 49, said: ‘Why don’t you want to invest in that? I don’t get it. These f***ers who try to avoid it should hang their heads in shame. That comedian… What’s his name? Carr? W***er. I mean, just w***er. No, he’s not getting away with it for me.

The 8 Out Of 10 Cats presenter (see here with Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall) said that he had ‘made a terrible error of judgement’ over the arrangement and was no longer involved in the K2 tax shelter

‘Sorry, there are people dying because we don’t pay our taxes. I’m proud to be a 50 per cent tax-payer, very proud of it. Sorry, you’re not getting away with it. Shame on you… because you didn’t pay your tax.’

Carr apologised and changed his tax arrangements in 2012 after the scandal emerged
