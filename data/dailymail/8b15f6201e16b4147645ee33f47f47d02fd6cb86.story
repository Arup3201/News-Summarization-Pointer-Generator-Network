Darron Gibson fears he has just one more opportunity to prove himself at Everton and for the Republic of Ireland following the knee injury which has ruled him out for almost a year.

The 26-year-old will feature for his country in Wednesday's friendly against Oman in what will be his first appearance at the Aviva Stadium since he sustained an anterior cruciate ligament in his knee 10 months ago.

Under threat? Darron Gibson fears for his place at Everton and Republic of Ireland following injury

The former Manchester United midfielder is keen to make up for lost time with his place in both the Everton and Republic of Ireland squad under threat. 

He told the Liverpool Echo: 'Being out for 10 months last season gave me a lot of time to think about things, and I think this is now or never, really, to be honest with you, so I am looking forward to the task ahead.

'It just made me realise that I'm not getting any younger. I need to start playing games and I need to start doing well for myself. It's a big opportunity for me.'
