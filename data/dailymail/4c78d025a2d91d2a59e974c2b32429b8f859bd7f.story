A British man has died in the Egyptian holiday resort of Sharm El-Sheikh.

The 50-year-old drowned while swimming off the Red Sea coast on Friday.

A British Foreign & Commonwealth Office spokesman said: 'We can confirm the death of a British national in Egypt on 22 February.

'We are providing consular assistance to the family at this difficult time.'

Sharm el Sheikh is one of the main Red Sea resorts and attracts millions of tourists each year.

Several people drown there every year while snorkelling or swimming.

Last month a British catering company owner from Formby, Merseyside, died while singing karaoke on holiday at Sharm el-Sheikh.

Leah Rice, 41, was with her family at the five-star Hilton Sharks Hotel when she collapsed just one day before she was due to return home.
