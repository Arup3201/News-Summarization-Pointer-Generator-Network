A politician in Pakistan has been arrested after seven people - including two women and three children - were discovered chained up in a dungeon at his home, according to police.

They were discovered when Abdul Rehman Khetran's private guards attacked police at a checkpoint on Sunday and stole their weapons.

Officers then raided the MP's home in the Baluchistan province where they found the cellar.

According to the Pakistan Observer, three children were found with four adults.

After freeing the prisoners, police arrested Khetran, his son, and six private guards, according to Barkhan district police chief Abdul Ghafoor Marri.

The prisoners had been mistreated, Marri said, adding that police had also seized a truck filled with ammunition and weapons at the premises.

Khetran told local reporters the arrests were politically motivated and that it was illegal for police to enter his house.

Khetran, whose wife is also a politician, is an MP for Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam, a conservative religious party, and a former provincial minister for special education.

The mineral-rich western region of Baluchistan is deeply impoverished and a haven for smugglers, drug lords, Taliban insurgents and separatist rebels.
