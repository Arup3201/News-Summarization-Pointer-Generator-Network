North Korea has denounced Seth Rogen and James Franco as 'terrorists' in a stern letter to the UN Secretary General over their new comedy which lampoons its leader.

The secretive regime lodged a formal protest over The Interview, a farcical story of tabloid journalists hired by the CIA to assassinate Kim Jong Un.

It stars Rogen and Franco as the two television reporters who turn assassin after landing an interview with Kim in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital.

The North Korean Foreign Ministry had 
previously warned the U.S. of 'stern' and 'merciless' retaliation if it 
fails to block the release of the film, which is out on October 14.

Now,
 in a letter addressed to UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, North 
Korea's UN envoy Ja Song-Nam says allowing the film to be made and seen 
constitutes 'the most undisguised sponsoring of terrorism as well as a 
war action.'

'The US 
authorities should take immediate and appropriate action to ban the 
production and distribution of the film, otherwise it will be fully 
responsible for encouraging and sponsoring terrorism,' the letter says.

North
 Korea asked that the letter be circulated as an official document to 
members of the UN General Assembly and Security Council for their 
consideration.

International incident: James Franco and Seth Rogen's latest feature, The Interview, depicts the pair trying to kill the country's Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un - and North Korea is not amused

Last month, 
North Korea denounced the film as a 'wanton act of terror' and warned of
 a 'merciless response' unless it was pulled from distribution.

In
 a statement carried by North Korea's official KCNA news agency, a 
foreign ministry spokesman said the film was the work of 'gangster 
moviemakers' and should never be shown.

The
 'reckless U.S. provocative insanity' is triggering 'a gust of hatred 
and rage' among North Korean people, the spokesman said, adding that its
 release would be considered an 'act of war that we will never 
tolerate'.

Rogen poked fun 
at the threat on Twitter, writing: 'People don't usually wanna kill me 
for one of my movies until after they've paid 12 bucks for it.'

In
 the film's trailer, a secret agent played by Lizzy Caplan says Kim must
 be stopped as his people believe anything he says including 'that he 
speaks to dolphins and doesn't pee or poo.'

Special access: James and Seth play talk show host and producer that have been chosen to interview the leader

Kim
 Myong-chol, executive director of The Centre for North Korea-US Peace 
and an unofficial spokesman for Pyongyang, told the Telegraph its 
assassination plot represents America's foreign policy as a whole.

'There is a special irony in this storyline as it shows the desperation of the US government and American society,' he said.

'A
 film about the assassination of a foreign leader mirrors what the U.S. 
has done in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and Ukraine. And let us not forget 
who killed [President John F.] Kennedy â€“ Americans.'

He added: 'In fact, President Obama should be careful in case the US military wants to kill him as well.'

'The Interview' is not the first Hollywood film to mock a North Korean leader.

In
 the 2004 satirical action comedy 'Team America,' Kim's father Kim 
Jong-Il was portrayed as a speech-impaired, isolated despot.
