Promises: David Cameron suggested he would never cut the NHS budget while he is prime minister

David Cameron yesterday suggested he would never cut the NHS budget while he is prime minister.

He made the claim as he came under pressure from all sides to lift the protection from spending cuts currently given to health, schools and foreign aid.

In an unlikely alliance, Liberal Democrat Business Secretary Vince Cable and leading Tory Right-winger Liam Fox joined forces to insist the Government’s budget ‘ring-fences’ were unsustainable.

A think-tank report today warns that health alone will account for 22.5 per cent of the total increase in spending between 2011-12 and 2014-15.

But the Prime Minister insisted he would not countenance cutting health spending.

And despite a growing Cabinet revolt, Downing Street said the special protections for schools and foreign aid would also be extended in the next spending review, to cover Government expenditure for 2015-16.

‘When you look particularly at the NHS, you know that we have got an ageing population.

There is massive pressure on the NHS, more expensive treatments and drugs are coming through, and I just don’t believe it is practical or right to cut the NHS,’ Mr Cameron said.

‘There are many good suggestions coming from many quarters. As prime minister I am never short of advice. But there’s one piece of advice I won’t take and that’s the piece of advice that says you ought to cut the National Health Service budget.

‘We made a very clear promise before the last election that yes, we were going to have to take difficult decisions, yes we were going to have to make some very difficult and painful cuts, but we wouldn’t cut the NHS budget. I think it’s really important for people to know that.’

He added: ‘I don’t deny for one moment we’ve had to take difficult decisions; we are in a tough economic environment. I want people to know as we go through that tough economic environment the NHS is going to be there for them.

In an unlikely alliance, Liberal Democrat Business Secretary Vince Cable and leading Tory Right-winger Liam Fox joined forces to insist the Government’s budget ‘ring-fences’ were unsustainable

‘The NHS is not going to be cut by this government.’ 

But Dr Fox, the former defence secretary who is tipped for a return to the Cabinet, suggested there should be a public spending freeze of between three and five years, and challenged Mr Cameron’s decision to protect certain budgets.

‘We must also ask whether ring-fencing departmental budgets makes sense in a period of prolonged austerity,’ he said.

He also backed Mr Cable’s call for pensioner benefits, such as the winter fuel allowance, free bus pass and TV licence, to be reviewed.

On ring-fencing the Business Secretary yesterday warned: ‘It means that all future pressures then come on things like the Army, the police, local government, skills and universities. So you get a very unbalanced approach to public spending.’

A report from the centre-Right think-tank Reform says today that the ring-fences on key areas of spending mean Chancellor George Osborne was operating ‘with one hand tied behind his back’.

It said the Prime Minister could not reasonably continue to rule out reducing spending on the NHS, pensioner benefits and schools.

James Zuccollo, senior economist at Reform, said: ‘The UK’s problems with overspending will not be addressed without a new approach.

'The problems facing the public finances are structural and they require structural solutions.’
