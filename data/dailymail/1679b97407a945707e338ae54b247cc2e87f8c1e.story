When Todd and Melissa Puchalla decided they no longer wanted to raise Quita, the teenager they adopted from Liberia, they went about getting rid of her the way one would an old refrigerator or furniture - they advertised her online.

While traditional adoptions take months and usually years to finalize, Quita was snapped up by another family in less than two days.

Nicole and Calvin Eason of Westville, Illinois wrote an email to the Puchalla's expressing their interest in adopting Quita.

Private re-homing: Quita, middle, with Calvin and Nicole Eason - the couple her adoptive parents sent her to live with when they no longer wanted to raise the teenager from Liberia

Gave her up: Todd and Melissa Puchalla, pictured above, adopted Quita from Liberia but were struggling to raise the troubled teenager - so they advertised her to other parents online and found a willing couple in two days

Advertised: The Puchallas are just one of many adoptive parents who struggle with their adopted children and try to place them with new families by advertising them online in a process known as 'private re-homing'

'People that are around me think I am awesome with kids,' Nicole Eason wrote.

From their email exchanges, Mrs Puchalla felt that the Easons 'seemed wonderful' and were qualified enough to take in Quita..

A few weeks later in October 2008, they drove from their home in Wisconsin to the Eason's in Illinois and dropped Quita off at the mobile home park the teenager would now be calling home.

Quita's case is just one of many discovered by Reuters and NBC News in their investigation of 'private re-homing'.

The term used to refer to the process of pet owners looking for new homes for their animals, but has now grown to include the re-homing of humans due to the similarity in advertisements placed online.

But humans are not animals, and placing them with perfect strangers raises the risk of placing them with abusers.

And that seems to have been the case with the Easons.

It turns out that child welfare authorities had taken away Nicole Eason's two biological children and a sheriff's deputy wrote that she and her husband had 'severe psychiatric problems' and 'violent tendencies'.

Nicole Eason denies that her children were taken away from her, and says that they are still living with her - something authorities say is not true.

And they had adopted children this way before on at least six occasions. In 2006, Nicole Eason and another man, Randy Winslow, adopted a 10-year-old boy online.

Later, Winslow was arrested for sending and receiving child pornography and is currently serving a 20-year sentence in federal prison.

The 10-year-old was sent to live with a foster family and just recently turned 18. His foster parents refused to let him be interviewed.

On Quita's first night with the Easons, they told her to sleep in their bed, and Quita remembers that her adoptive mother was not wearing any clothing.

When asked by Reuters what her personal parenting style is, Nicole Eason responded: 'Dude, just be a little mean, OK? …  I’ll threaten to throw a knife at your a**, I will. I’ll chase you with a hose'

When Melissa Puchalla couldn't get in contact with the Easons within days of dropping Quita off, she alerted the authorities and they tracked the girl down two weeks later and sent her back to Wisconsin alone on a bus.

Now 21, Quita lives by herself and is going to school.

American nightmares: She says she thought America would be a safer place, but that 'it turned into a nightmare'

When she first came to America, she thought she was 'coming to a nicer place, a safer place. It didn't turn out that way. It turned into a nightmare'.

And Quita was just one of many cases Reuters found in their investigation of private re-homing.

They found entire message boards on Yahoo and Facebook dedicated to advertising adopted children and estimate that 70 per cent of the children offered were foreign-born adoptees.

They come from countries all over the world, and range in age from as young as 10 months old to teenagers.

Reuters analyzed 5,029 posts on one Yahoo group page over five years.

One adoptive mother's post from March 2012 for her 12-year-old daughter reads: 'I would have given her away to a serial killer, I was so desperate.'

One adopted child from China says after she was re-homed, her new parents made her dig her own grave.

A girl from Russia says she was re-home three times in six months.

When she was 13, she says she had sex with a boy at one of the homes and he urinated on her afterwards.

After notifying Yahoo about the pages, the company has taken them down.

But a similar page on Facebook continues to run on a private basis. A spokesman for the social network said that the page shows 'that the internet is a reflection of society'.

There is one safeguard in place to protect these children: the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children. If a child is transferred into the custody of a new family in a different state, it requires both families to alart the authorities in both states so that prospective parents can be vetted.

But there is no way for the ICPC to hold these parents accountable if they don't notify them.

It wasn't until January 2011 that a ICPC official wrote a nationwide alert saying private re-homing online posed a 'grave danger' to children and puts them 'at substantial risk.'
