Talk show legend Larry King has revealed that he wants his body frozen when he dies so that he can be revived at some later date in the future to continue his TV career.

The broadcaster, who is going to be 82 in November, said he doesn't believe in the afterlife and so is considering getting frozen so that he can one day make a surprise return.

'I think I'd like to be frozen and that would be the only hope that I could come back,' he said. 'My wife says, 'What if you come back 200 years from now? You won't know anybody?' I say, 'I'll make new friends.' [laughs] So I fear death.'

King, who spent 25 years hosting his CNN chat show Larry King Live until it ended in 2010, told The Hill that being frozen felt 'logical' to him.

'They take the body right away. They put it in a compression chamber, they inject you with a fluid that keeps certain things working even while you're dead, it keeps blood flowing and the like. They get you into a chamber. And they don't chop your head off, that's not true, that's just a rumor,' he explained.

King, who had clearly done his homework, explained that the procedure costs $130,00 and his body would be placed in a tube in either Arizona or New Hampshire.

'If you died of lung cancer, and they cure it, and they can unfreeze you, and take away your lung cancer, why not? It's better than embalming and then being put in the ground. Or being burned. Come on.'

Once King is revived he plans to continue with his career as an interviewer.

'They'll be shows from the moon. My God, would we travel electronically? Don't you wonder about those things? What is the future going to be like?,' he asked. 

The broadcaster, pictured with Snoop Dogg, currently hosts Larry King Now on Hulu and RT America during the week, and on Thursdays he hosts Politicking with Larry King

'Yes, I'd want to interview people. I'd want to interview the guy from Mars. And go to other planets and ask questions.'

King began his broadcast career in the 1950s as a local journalist and radio interviewer in Florida.

He rose through the ranks to become a prominent all-night national radio broadcaster starting in 1978, and then, in 1985, began hosting the nightly interview TV program Larry King Live on CNN. 

He currently hosts Larry King Now on Hulu and RT America during the week, and on Thursdays he hosts Politicking with Larry King, a weekly political talk show which airs in the evening on the same two channels.

Over his expansive career he has earned an Emmy, two Peabody Awards and ten Cable ACE Awards among other accolades.
