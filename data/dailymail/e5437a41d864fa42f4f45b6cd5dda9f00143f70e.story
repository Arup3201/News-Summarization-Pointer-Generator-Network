The Mayor of London plans to build a 'Crossrail for the bike' as part of an ambitious £900m plan to build a huge cycle path through the capital.

The segregated route will run for more than 15 miles from the western suburbs through the heart of London to Canary Wharf and Barking.

It will use new Dutch-style segregated cycle tracks along, among other places, the Victoria Embankment and the Westway flyover.

It is believed to be the longest substantially-segregated cycle route of any city in Europe, as Boris Johnson said he wanted to encourage novice cyclists to 'get in the saddle'.

He said he wanted to overhaul the image that cycling is just for Lycra-clad enthusiasts, and wanted bikes to reclaim the city's streets.

Yesterday the Mayor announced that the main cross-London physical legacy of the 2012 Olympic Games will be a proper network of cycle routes across the city.

Over the next four years London will open a range of high-quality new cycle routes parallel to, and named after, Tube lines and bus routes, so everyone knows where they go.

The Mayor added: 'I want to de-Lycrafy cycling. I want to make it normal, something for everyone, something you feel comfortable doing in your ordinary clothes.

'Our new routes will give people the confidence to get in the saddle.

' I do not promise perfection, or that London will become Amsterdam any time soon.'

The Mayor said that cycling would reduce traffic, make the city a greener, more pleasant place and save lives.

'The reason I am spending almost £1 billion on this is my belief that helping cycling will not just help cyclists. It will create better places for everyone.

'It means less traffic, more trees, more places to sit and eat a sandwich.

'It means more seats on the Tube, less competition for a parking place and fewer cars in front of yours at the lights.

The London Assembly's Transport Committee warned that without adequate funding targets would not be reached

The number of people using cycle lanes in central London has risen by 155 per cent, the London Assembly said

'Above all, it will fulfill my aim of making London’s air cleaner. If just 14 per cent of journeys in central London were cycled, emissions there of the greatest vehicle pollutant, NOx, would fall by almost a third and over the years literally thousands of lives could be saved.'

Despite the Mayor's grand plans, there are concerns that there might be inadequate funding.

The London Assembly's Transport Committee warned that without adequate funding targets would not be reached and the plan could fall woefully short of its expectations.

The Committee called on the Mayor to double Transport for London's budget for cycling, to tackle the recent rise in cycling injuries, which have seen a 50 per cent increase in London since 2006.

TfL confirmed £913 million will be spent in the capital over a decade, but the Committee claimed that this is insufficient and, per year, only matches the budget provided for cycling in 2010.

London experienced a 155 per cent increase in people cycling to work over the past decade, so the Transport Committee welcomed the Mayor's vision for cycling.

Caroline Pidgeon AM, Chair of the London Assembly’s Transport Committee, said: 'Far from seeing evidence of a serious commitment to a "cycling revolution", the Mayor’s vision lacks ambition for his pledges to make London safer and more inviting for cycling.

'While £913 million may seem an impressive figure, its impact will be diluted over ten years and is not a significant advancement on current funding levels. To have real impact, we’re calling for the investment in cycling to be doubled.'

The plan includes major and substantial improvements to the worst junctions, making them safer and less threatening for cyclists with measures such as segregation and cycle-only paths or phases.

Junctions to be tackled in the next three years include Blackfriars, Vauxhall, Tower, Swiss Cottage, and Elephant & Castle.

The budget for TfL’s safer junction review has been more than quintupled, from £19 million to £100 million, and the money will be focused on fewer sites.

Other elements in the 'Mayor's Vision for Cycling' include:

The overall budget for cycling will rise to £913 million, two and a half times more than previously planned, with almost £400 million spent in the next three years alone.

Cycle spending will rise to £145 million in 2015, or around £18 per head, up with the best in Germany and almost on a par with the Netherlands.

TfL is conducting off-site trials of new, cyclist-friendly innovations, such as 'Dutch-style' roundabouts and eye-level traffic lights for cyclists.

If these trials are successful, and the Department for Transport allows, they will be rolled out on the road network.
