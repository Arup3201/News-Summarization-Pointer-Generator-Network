Zuckerberg has launched a political group aimed at revamping immigration policy, boosting education and encouraging investment in scientific research

Teaming up with other Silicon Valley leaders, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has formally launched a political group aimed at revamping immigration policy, boosting education and encouraging investment in scientific research.

Zuckerberg announced the formation of Fwd.us (pronounced 'forward us') in an op-ed article in The Washington Post yesterday.

In it, he said the U.S. needs a new approach to these issues if it is to get ahead economically. This, he wrote, includes offering talented, skilled immigrants a path to citizenship.

'We have a strange immigration policy for a nation of immigrants, Zuckerberg wrote. 'And it's a policy unfit for today's world.'

The move comes as a bipartisan Senate group is expected to roll out on a comprehensive immigration bill in the coming days.

Zuckerberg's goal echoes the proposed legislation. He said he wants 'comprehensive immigration reform that begins with effective border security, allows a path to citizenship and lets us attract the most talented and hardest-working people, no matter where they were born.'

Of Jewish extraction, Zuckerberg's interest in immigration stems from the fact that his own great-grandparents arrived as immigrants via Ellis Island, to America, coupled with his experience teaching entrepreneurship at an after-school program.

In the article, he explained how his students put together business plans, made their products and got an opportunity to sell them.

'My great-grandparents came through Ellis Island.

'My grandfathers were a mailman and a police officer.

'My parents are doctors. I started a company.

'None of this could have happened without a welcoming immigration policy, a great education system and the world’s leading scientific community that created the Internet'

During this period he asked one of his students, whose family are from Mexico, what he wanted to go on to do do. He responded that he wasn’t sure that he’d be able to go to college because he didn't have any immigration documentation.

Zuckerberg found that many students in his community were in the same situation; they moved to the United States so early in their lives that they have no memories of living anywhere else - yet couldn't progress through the education system.

At the top of the Fwd.us website it explains in bite-sized facts just why immigration is important to the future of America and reminds users that: '40 per cent of Fortune 500 companies were founded by immigrants or their children' and that '57% of engineering grad students are immigrants. Many will have to leave if we don’t pass comprehensive immigration reform.'

Zuckerberg also calls for higher standards and accountability in schools and increased focus on learning about science, technology, engineering and maths.

Today's knowledge and ideas-based economy, the 28-year-old Harvard dropout wrote, is very different from the economy of the 20th century that was based on natural resources, industrial machines and labour.

Fwd.us, Zuckerberg said, was created 'to build 
the knowledge economy the United States needs to ensure more jobs, 
innovation and investment'. Screen grab of the Fwd.us website

● Comprehensive immigration reform that begins with effective border security, allows a path to citizenship and lets us attract the most talented and hardest-working people, no matter where they were born.● Higher standards and accountability in schools, support for good teachers and a much greater focus on learning about science, technology, engineering and math.● Investment in breakthrough discoveries in scientific research and assurance that the benefits of the inventions belong to the public and not just to the few.

Fwd.us, he said, was created 'to build the knowledge economy the United States needs to ensure more jobs, innovation and investment.'

Also backing the group are tech leaders such as LinkedIn Corp. CEO Reid Hoffman, venture capitalists John Doerr and Jim Breyer, as well as Ruchi Sanghvi of Dropbox, who was Facebook Inc.'s first female engineer. Joe Green, founder of Causes.com, a social network for community organizing, serves as the group's president and founder.

Major contributors include Google Inc. chairman Eric Schmidt, Netflix Inc. CEO Reed Hastings, Yahoo Inc. CEO Marissa Mayer, SpaceX and Tesla Motors CEO Elon Musk, Zynga Inc. CEO Mark Pincus and former Groupon Inc. CEO Andrew Mason.
