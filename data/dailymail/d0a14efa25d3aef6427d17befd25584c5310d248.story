A banker has died after becoming impaled on railings after falling 60ft from the window of a luxury penthouse in central London, which is next door to John Lennon's former home.

Police were called to the exclusive block of flats in Montagu Square in Marylebone at about 5.20pm yesterday, but were unable to save the man who was in his early fifties.

Firefighters had to help police cut through the five foot high metal railings with an angle grinder, as part of attempts to free the man.

Metropolitan Police said the man's death was not being treated as suspicious but confirmed enquiries were being carried out into the circumstances surrounding his death.

The man, believed to be a banker, fell from the fourth floor window of the exclusive £3million flat (far right) in Montagu Square in Marylebone, central London. He died after becoming impaled on the railings below

Police and fire crews used an angle grinder to try and free the man from the metal railings (pictured) but he was pronounced dead at the scene. Witnesses described seeing his body on the railings for several hours

The £3million split-level flat is next door to a property which used to be owned by Beatles frontman John Lennon, where Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr and Jimi Hendrix all stayed in the 1960s. 

A blue heritage plaque outside the property, which Lennon shared with Yoko Ono, confirms the musician lived there in 1968. It was first bought by Starr in 1965 and later rented out to McCartney and Hendrix before Lennon and Ono took it over as their first home together.

A mother described today how her five-year-old son said 'mummy, there's a dead man' seconds after the man plummeted from the fourth floor window.

The woman, who refused to give her name, said: 'I was walking down the street and was about five car lengths away when I heard a big bang, like a bottle hitting the floor and smashing.

'The next thing I saw was a man there on the railings.'

The woman, in her thirties, added: 'Even my five-year-old son saw and said "mummy, there's a dead man." I think he's okay despite what he saw.

'I told him there wasn't and walked him up the street and out of sight before calling the police.

'The man was definitely impaled but I couldn't see much because it was so dark and I didn't want to look.

'It was horrible, I'm still in shock.'

One neighbour described the scene (pictured) as 'horrible', while another said it was 'gruesome'

Another witness described how she saw the body of the man, who was thought to be living with his American girlfriend at the time, hanging off railings.

The south-east Asian woman, who lives on the square, said she saw the body despite police attempts to cover it up.

The woman, who asked not to be named, said: 'The police had covered the body but I could see from behind that he was on the spike because I could see his feet dangling towards the basement floor.

The railings outside the property in Montagu Square, where flats sell for millions, cordoned off

'It was horrible, I had to divert my eyes.'

Another neighbour, who wished to remain anonymous, added: 'It is horrific and very sad. 

'My cleaners were here and saw the man's body. They were traumatised.

'It was a very gruesome scene. The body was there for a while.

'Police covered it with a tent straight away when they arrived but quite a few people must have seen it. I could not look, I was horrified.'  

According to neighbours, the man is believed to have worked in the banking or financial services industry.

London Fire Brigade confirmed two fire engines and a response unit attended the incident.

A spokesman said: 'They had to cut through the railings. They are trained to deal with all different types of incidents.'

A Met Police spokesman said: 'Police were called to Montagu Square, W1, at 17:18 hours on Monday to reports of a man having fallen from a fourth floor window.

'A man, believed aged in his early 50s, was pronounced dead at the scene.

'The death is not being treated as suspicious at this time.'

London Ambulance Service also confirmed that a number of paramedics attended the incident but said the man was pronounced dead at the scene.

Flats in the square sell for more than £3million while rents for duplex apartments can reach up to £8,000 a month. 

An elderly lady who lives in the flat below the victim, who asked not be named, said: 'I had only seen the man once as he was coming down the stairs.

'He was a white man, probably in his 50s, but I really know nothing about him or what happened.

'I think he was British but he lived with an American woman who I'd say was a bit younger. Their flat was on the third and fourth floor.

'We don't know what happened, but have heard he fell from the top floor onto the railings below.'

Police put a tent in place in the wake of the incident at 5.20pm yesterday and remained at the scene for hours

The incident occurred next door to a property which was formerly occupied by Beatles' John Lennon

A builder, who was working on a neighhbour's home at the time of the accident, said: 'His body was covered when I came outside and there were police everywhere.

'But you could work out what happened, he must have come out of the window and onto the railings. There was blood everywhere.

'I came outside to see what was happening because I heard all the sirens and when I came out I could see that the top floor window was open.'
