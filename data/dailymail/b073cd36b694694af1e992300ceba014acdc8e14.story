A lineman who suits up for the Baltimore Ravens obviously knows his X's and O's because he made it to the NFL - but it's pretty clear this particular player is also quite familiar with the number line. 

Offensive guard John Urschel recently had a math research paper published in the Journal of Computational Mathematics.

The 23-year-old pro, who goes by MathMeetsFball on Twitter after graduating from Pennsylvania State University with a 4.0 GPA and a master's degree in math, also competed in a chess tournament for the first time earlier this month.

Offensive guard John Urschel had a math paper published and competed in a chess tournament this offseason

Ursche said he had a 'great time talking to the advanced statistics class' at a high school earlier this month

Urschel's Computational Mathematics paper was co-written by Ludmil Zikatanov, Jinchao Xu and Xiaozhe Hu

The paper was titled, 'A Cascadic Multigrid Algorithm for Computing the Fiedler Vector of Graph Laplacians', and it was co-written by Ludmil Zikatanov, Jinchao Xu and Xiaozhe Hu. 

A portion of the abstract reads: 'In this paper, we develop a cascadic multigrid algorithm for fast computation of the Fiedler vector of a graph Laplacian, namely, the eigenvector corresponding to the second smallest eigenvalue.

'This vector has been found to have applications in fields such as graph partitioning and graph drawing.'

The paper was published on March 17, just three days after Pi Day. 

Urschel, who refers to himself as a published mathematician and professional mathlete, celebrated both occasions on Twitter. 

The 23-year-old pro posts many math-related things while using the handle MathMeetsFball on Twitter

On March 14, he wrote: 'Happy Pi Day!!!! 

'Take some time to check out all of its properties and the amazing things it's involved in. 

'My favorite is Euler's identity.' 

Earlier in the month, he posted about competing in the Pittsburgh Open Chess Grand Prix. 

Urschel wrote: 'Just finished my first chess tournament ever. 

'Scored 3 points in five rounds in the U1700 of the Pittsburgh Open!!!' 

He wears No. 64 because eight to the power of two is a perfect square, USA Today reported. 

Urschel said: 'It's a very nice number. It works for me.

'With football and math, I'm very precise. With everything else, I'm a simple guy.'
