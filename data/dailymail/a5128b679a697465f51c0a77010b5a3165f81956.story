Britain is feeding the world, challenging national stereotypes to sell tea to China, beer to Belgium and cheese to France.

The powers of persuasion of the UK's food and drink producers have not quite managed to sell snow to the Eskimos, but they have got a deal to export ice cubes to Sweden.

A record 150 countries worldwide now import British produce to supermarkets, bars and restaurants, taking total sales last year to almost £19billion.

Britain has shaken off its reputation for bad food to now take on countries at their own game, exporting wine to Italy, chocolate to Belgium, cheese to France and even tea to China

Ministers boast they have helped a record 2,500 food and drink firms to sell their produce abroad in the last year.

It seems Britain has finally shaken off its reputation for grim grub to now take on homegrown industries 'at their own game'.

Most notably, sales of cheese to France – which prides itself on its fromage – have soared by more than a quarter in four years to top £70million in 2013.

There are now more varieties of cheese produced in the UK than the whole of France, with British firms exporting to 86 different countries last year.

The Ice Co. exports ice cubes made in Britain to unlikely countries including Sweden, Denmark, France and Hong Kong.

Tea might be the quintessentially British drink, but we have been importing tea leaves from China since the 17th century.

Now, the tables have turned, with £330,000 worth of tea exported to China between January and September this year, up 30 per cent in a year.

Beer is also finding fans in unlikely places, like the USA, Australia and Belgium, all home to world famous brands like Budweiser, Fosters and Stella Artois.

Environment Secretary Elizabeth Truss told MailOnline: 'The world over, we're beating people at their own game when it comes to exporting our first rate food and drink – our chillies are shipped to Pakistan, our ice is flown to Sweden, the Belgians can't get enough of our beer and the Chinese are sipping Yorkshire tea.

'We've had huge success in this area which is why the UK's entire food chain has now smashed the £100 billion mark generating more money than ever for our growing economy.

'We have opened, on average, almost three new international markets every week since 2010. This has helped a record number of British food and drinks companies sell their delicious produce abroad, building a stronger economy for the UK.' 

But sales of British beer overseas have trebled in recent years, and are now worth £93million to Belgium alone, up from just £3million in 2010.

Sales to Australia have more than doubled to £11million while to the USA they have risen by more than a third to £147million.

For the first time the UK is even exporting chillies to Pakistan, a market now worth £40,000 but with the potential for huge growth.

Environment Secretary Liz Truss said Britain is 'beating people at their own game' when by exporting food and drink around the world

Latest figures show that 1.6 per cent of all chilli exports so far in 2014 have been to Pakistan, a country with a strong traditional chilli culture of its own.

The UK market in chillies to the Netherlands and France alone is worth almost £900million.

Switzerland and Belgium might have a global reputation for their own fine chocolate, but both are now importing British versions too.

Chocolate sales to Switzerland are up 160 per cent since 2010 to reach almost £10million. Sales to Belgium last year were worth £17million and to Germany £35million.

Cider might have its roots in Somerset scrumpy, but thanks to a modern revival it is enjoying growing popularity around the world.

Drinks in Singapore, Thailand, Bulgaria and the USA have got a taste for it, with sales to these four countries worth £7.5million alone, including £435million to Singapore.

For a long time English wine may have been seen as a joke, but is now a major player in the global market.

While the French pride themselves on their Chardonnay and Sauvignon Blanc, last year they imported more than £48million worth of UK wine, up 11 per cent in a year. Sales to Australia hit £3million, Italy £2million and South Africa £1.3million.

The biscuit business is booming too, exporting 7.5million biscuits to 143 countries last year, generating a record £1.1billion for the UK economy.

The USA is the biggest market, worth almost £21million, up more than a quarter since 2010.

The Germans bought £15million in British biscuits in 2013, while almost £10million went to both the UAE and Nigeria.
