A 47-year-old  caretaker obsessed  throwing extravagant parties has just become the coolest kid in school - by building a giant pirate ship in his back garden.

Tim Jones can now make troublesome guests walk the plank on his 25ft creation - which he built himself and takes up half of his garden.

He has been throwing themed birthday parties for years - he has treated friends to a Medieval banquet, Mexican barbecue and 1940s-style ball in the past.

Whittle me timbers! School caretaker Tim Jones has built a 25ft long pirate ship in his back garden

Eccentric: Mr Jones (left) has always loved pirate ships, and spent six months on his creation

But this year he has really had to put all hands on deck. The huge ship comes complete with rigging, a classic Jolly Rodger and a 25ft high mast, and took six months to complete.

Incredibly, it even boasts a cannon, though neighbours will be very glad to know that it is not the real thing.

Mr Jones, from Felixstowe, Suffolk, said: 'I have always loved pirates since I was a kid and then the Pirates of the Caribbean movies came out and it brought it all alive.

Monstrous: The ship's mast is made from a telegraph pole and is 25ft high, complete with sheets and rigging

'I have had loads of themed parties but it seemed pirates was the one everybody loved the most.

'I started putting the odd bit in last summer then it just grew and grew. I got the telegraph pole for the mast then it sort of got out of hand.

'Most of the stuff was just unwanted and school donated loads of fence panels. I really didn't spend that much money on it.

'My friends and their kids love it. It is a good way to get everybody up and involved when I have a party.

It's party time! Mr Jones' friends enjoy his months of hard work as they play around in the ship

'They all enjoy running around it, but I think I'm the biggest kid of all.'

Mr Jones' girlfriend has two children, who love playing on the ship, and the caretaker would like to make it even bigger.

Unfortunately that will not be possible however, as the firmly moored boat is already taking up too much space.

The floor of the ship has been covered in decking while standard fence panels have been erected to give it its shape.

Just like the real thing: Mr Jones has pulled out all the stops, adding a skeleton and lights for night time

A captain's cabin comes complete with a bench, wooden chest and a chiminea, while fish netting adorns the boat's walls.

The 25ft telegraph pole acts as the central mast while bed sheets and rope make up the vessel's sails.

And the whole thing is topped off, of course, with a creepy skeleton and a chirpy model parrot. 

It is  about 25ft long and 15ft wide and has become somewhat of a talking point with pupils at the nearby Felixstowe Academy, where he works.

Mr Jones said: 'You can see it from the road, there's a big flag flying and the mast - it's quite a sight.

'They walk past it every day and you can hear them laughing and joking.
