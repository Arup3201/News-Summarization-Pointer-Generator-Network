Lost and found: Oklahoma farmer Kevin Whitney (pictured) lost his iPhone in a grain elevator last October, but it was returned more than seven months later when a Japanese mill worker found it buried in a shipment

Oklahoma farmer Kevin Whitney beams with pride as he walks his daughter down the aisle on her wedding day, in a treasured photo he thought he lost forever when he accidentally dropped his iPhone in a grain elevator last October.

But that picture and other precious family photos are now safely home after his cellphone was miraculously found seven months later, more than 6,000 miles away in Japan.Â 

Whitney's phone started it's long journey across the globe back in October 2013, when the farmer accidentally lost the phone in a grain pit on his Chickasha farm.

'I had it in my pocket and I bent over to work on a copper bottom door and it fell out of my pocket into my grain pit and went up the elevator,' he told KFOR.

'I thought "I'll never see that phone again,"' Whitney also said.

Whitney went out and got a new phone the next day, while his bin of 280,000 pounds of grain was moved to another Oklahoma grain facility, down the Arkansas and Mississippi Rivers and then to a Louisiana depot where it was loaded on a ship bound for Japan's Hokkaido island.

It was at the Zen-Noh Grain Corporation processing facility in Japan that that mill worker found the phone and sent it back to America.

Father of the bride: On the lost phone were treasured photos of a recent vacation and daughter Katie Whitney's wedding, which took place in College Station, Texas in March 2013

Last May, Whitney received a phone call from Eric Slater, manager of Zen-Noh's terminal in Convent, Louisiana, telling him that the phone had been recovered.

Slater says he charged up the phone and scrolled through the pictures of the wedding and a vacation and knew he had to return the phone to it's owner.

"I knew if that was my phone, I'd probably want it back," said Slater, who added it's not uncommon for cellphones to accidentally fall into grain shipments. "Frankly, I field about a phone a month."

Whitney's phone finally made it home in pristine condition last month and is now safely secured in his desk drawer.
