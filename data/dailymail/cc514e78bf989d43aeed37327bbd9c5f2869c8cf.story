The Queen could be hit with a £1million bill if Labour's 'mansion tax' comes into force

The Queen could be slapped with a £1million tax bill every year if Labour's proposed 'mansion tax' comes into force.

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, Princess Anne and the Duchess of Cornwall could also be hit by hefty bills by the tax, which would target everyone with a home worth more than £2million.

The likes of Buckingham Palace would not be taxed - as it is technically owned by the state - but Balmoral castle and Sandringham House would still leave the Queen with huge amounts to pay.

Tatler reported that Balmoral had been estimated to be worth up to £50million earlier this year, and if Sandringham were to fetch a similar fee, the Queen could be made to pay nearly £1million for the two homes - if they were both taxed at a rate of one per cent of their value over £2million, the Daily Express reports. 

Labour has not yet released full details of the tax on the wealthy, which they say could raise an extra £1.3billion for the NHS.

The idea has already been criticised by a number of its own MPs - as many of those based in London say it unfairly targets the capital.

Of all of Britain's homes worth £2million or more, 96 per cent of them are in London or the South East.

London mayor Boris Johnson has warned that  whose homes have gone up in value but do not earn huge salaries could end up being 'clobbered'.

And the Royal Family would take a significant hit along with them. The 500,000-acre Balmoral in Royal Deeside and 20,000-acre Sandringham in Norfolk could start to cause the Queen serious problems.

Meanwhile, Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge could have to pay around £10,000 each year for their Grade II listed Norfolk mansion Anmer Hall - which is 200 years old and has a swimming pool and a tennis court.

Princess Anne could face a tax bill of around £60,000 for £8million estimated Gatcombe Park, which the Queen bought for her and her then-husband Mark Phillips after they wed in 1973.

The nine-bedroom house's estimate has been calculated based on sales of other properties in the Gloucestershire area. 

And Duchess of Cornwall, Camilla Parker-Bowles, could face a £5,000 bill for Ray Mill House in Wiltshire, which she bought for £850,000 in 1996 and could now be worth around £2million. 

It is not certain whether Prince Charles' Highgrove House in Gloucestershire would be taxed, as it is owned by the Dutch of Cornwall, and similar goes for the Duke of York's Royal Lodge Windsor home, as it is a leasehold.

A Buckingham Palace spokesman told the Express: 'The Queen pays all taxes on the properties she owns privately.'
