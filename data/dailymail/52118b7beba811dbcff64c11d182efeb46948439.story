American Boo Weekley made five birdies and an eagle on his way to a six-under 66 at the Australian PGA on Thursday and a two-stroke lead over a group that included defending champion Adam Scott.

Weekley and Scott finished their rounds on the Royal Pines layout before lightning caused afternoon play to be suspended. Australian Marc Leishman, at 3-under after nine holes, was the only late-starting player on the leaderboard.

Australians Wade Ormsby, James Marchesani and Craig Hancock and New Zealander David Smail joined Scott with 68s. Jarrod Lyle, back playing regularly after recovering from his second bout of leukemia, shot 69.

Weekley, playing a third Australian tournament in four weeks, says 'I struck the ball solid, kept it in play, hit one bad drive and got away with it.'
