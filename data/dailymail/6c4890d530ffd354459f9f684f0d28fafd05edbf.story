The sex secrets of New York men reveal them to be a collection of neurotic, insecure, unfeeling perverts, too scared to commit to a relationship with someone they care for.

According to Big Apple sex therapist Dr. Brandy Engler, who has listened to the psychological issues of the men-folk of New York for seven-years, serial cheating, porn addiction and soliciting prostitutes are all symptoms of an inability to settle down in the big smoke.

From successful bank executives who pay for prostitutes, to S&M dungeon loving hedge fund chiefs and even men convinced that 'good guys finish last', Engler has listened to them all betray their sordid secrets - while charging them $150 an hour for the privilege.

Dr. Brandy Engler has spent seven years working out of her Times Square offices in New York examining the sexual problems of the men of the city

Indeed, Engler has conducted so many sessions out of her Times Square offices examining ailments such as sex addiction, erectile dysfunction, sexual anxiety, chronic womanizing, jealousy and porn addiction, that she has compiled them into a book called 'The Men on My Couch'.

'There were times I felt repugnance,' Engler admitted to The New York Post. 'Sometimes I had to work hard to hide my instinctual reactions.'

Originally opening her practice to counsel women, Engler says she was stunned that her most interesting clients were men.

'Young and handsome men — accomplished in almost every way — are coming to me nervous about being around women,' she said.

'They desire to please us, to perform for us, but have deep fears about what we really think about them. I was surprised at how many of my male clients were anxious to the point of dysfunction over their desire to satisfy a woman.'

The therapist outlines different cases in point, with names changed to protect their anonymity.

Dr. Engler found that successful men often found themselves seeking no-strings attach sex with prostitutes as a way of coping with their insecurities

Charles, a successful engineer was jilted by his fiancée on their wedding day and years later he makes his girlfriend play-act that she is two-timing him as the only way he can become sexually excited.

'Tell me how you're going to do it!' he commands.

'In the bathroom - while you're in the next room,' replies his confused girlfriend, half-heartedly.

Engler recounts how Charles' current relationship became so weird that the girlfriend began cheating on him for real and eventually left him.

Another striking example of the insecurities of men in New York who came to Engler for help was Paul, a bank executive in his early 40s who was deeply in love with his confident new wife.

However, according to Engler, Paul could not perform in the bedroom, telling her, 'I'm having trouble keeping it up. So I'm having sex with prostitutes. I'll give you five sessions to fix this.'

Together the pair analyzed his problems and realized that he was a 'blustery alpha male' who wanted sex without any expectation, or as he put it, sex with 'non-beings'.

Engler told The New York Post that erectile dysfunction was 'the most common complaint' that she'd heard. And 'many of the men who were visiting massage parlors did have some sort of sexual dysfunction...with the women that they were actually interested in.'

They got performance anxiety when it was someone whom they cared about pleasuring, or would judge them for it.

Dr. Engler conducted therapy with men who were only committed to the chase of gaining some women's telephone numbers - with no desire to call them

So sending Paul back to his wife, Engler tried to get him to treat his wife in a caring and compassionate manner - but his wife rebuked his efforts and he stopped attending therapy.

'In the end, it was Paul who had become the 'non-being'.

Another type of New York man was David, whom Engler dubbed 'The Number Gatherer.'

He was a successful hedge-fund manager, who lived in TriBeCa and had bagged himself a model girlfriend.

'My girlfriend is absolutely gorgeous,' he bragged according to The New York Post. 'She’s tall and blond, a model with a perfect rack and rock-hard abs.'

However, this wasn't enough for him and all he would do would spend time in clubs trying to get telephone numbers from available women - and most of the time would never call them back.

'It’s exciting, like winning a game,' he boasted to Engler. 'There’s a process to it, and I’m known for being the best.'

The old axiom that 'nice guys finish last' rang true on a number of occasions for Dr. Engler during her dealings with her disaffected male clients

Engler says that she established with Engler that he was a show-off, a narcissist for whom 'everything is measured by how the outside world sees him.'

Eventually after therapy, David discovered his girlfriend was cheating on him and he ended it with her, moved to Brooklyn and started learning to play the guitar.

'What I learned from David is that when men cheat, it’s often psychological, not physical,' Engler said. 'A man can be with the sexiest, most beautiful woman on Earth, but it will still not be enough.'

Of course there is the flip side to all this promiscuity, with the 'nice guy' who was in a relationship where his girlfriend did not find him interesting anymore.

Engler said that she had one couple, Kasha and Alex, who came to her because the sex had become monotonous.

'I’ve seen so many examples like this. Alex is the quintessential nice guy. He doesn’t know how to keep himself and his woman sexualized,' Engler said.

'I saw this all the time with my male clients: They learn some skills, but they don’t have the chutzpah — self-possession and courage — to pull it off.'

Dr. Engel also discovered that when men were married to women more secure and confident than them that they often strayed because of their own insecurities

On the other side of the scale is Oscar, a building contractor who openly admitted during a group therapy session that he was cheating on his wife with a younger woman.

'She'll do anything sexually,' he boasted to the group.

Engler told The New York Post that at first she would find it difficult to sympathize with a serial cheater until she could discover the reasons.

Oscar told her that he felt impotent in his relationship and that his wife was smarter and her family richer than his.

'My wife makes all the decisions around the house. I know it’s because I’m never home, but I feel useless when I’m there. I’m just a paycheck to her.

'I feel like she doesn’t appreciate anything,' he told Engler.

'The number one complaint from men about women in long-term relationships is, ‘I don’t feel appreciated,’ Engler told The Post.

'Men are looking for some expression that they are valued.'

No less destructive was the prevalence of pornography addiction among the men of New York City

The darker side of New York male sexuality is expressed by the so-called 'nice guys', trusted by women, but who hide the most dirty of secret sex lives.

Engler discusses Casey, who would have been seen as an enlightened soul, whose mother was a feminist.

The professor would complete a days work and then excitedly return home to download porn, especially degrading pornography.

As is usually the case, the porn stars he idolized were nothing like his girlfriend, who he called 'a porcelain doll' and whose lovemaking he felt was 'routine and vanilla.'

Engler has noted an increase in the number of men coming to her to examine their addiction to porn and she has some insight.

'I’m seeing this in a lot of men I treat,' Engler said. 

Other men had to attend S&M clubs where they would pay to hire women to 'torture' within the boundaries of the sexual play

'They feel like they can’t be their authentic selves around the women that they are in love with. But guys who feel this way will find outlets somewhere.'

In this case however, Casey's girlfriend was willing to come to therapy sessions where they were encouraged to discuss his more base sexual desires and now has 'much less interest in his nightly porn habit.'

As an offshoot of soliciting prostitutes, one patient of Englers, Mark had developed a secret love and desire to visit S&M clubs where he would pay for prostitutes and 'torture' them.'He feels dominated, powerless and trapped by the women in his life, and he is full of rage about it,' Engler says. 'So it busts out in his very compartmentalized sex life.'

However, for Engler, despite Mark's apparently well adjusted life, she says he taught her something about the 'good guys' of New York.

'There’s something wrong with their ability to be real and authentic. And they’re going to find a way to deal with their frustration elsewhere.'
