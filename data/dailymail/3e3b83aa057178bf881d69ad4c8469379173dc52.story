Everyone relishes that spark of falling in love for the first time. 

But, much as they try, few married couples get to feel it all over again. Unlike gobsmacked Jason Mortensen. Dosed up on morphine for a hernia 
operation, the love-struck American couldn't believe his eyes when he 
caught sight of the woman by his bed.

The video purportedly shows Mr Mortensen meeting his wife all over again for the first time, but there's now speculation over its authenticity.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

Was he faking? Mortensen's acting profile lists his ambitions as movies, TV shows and commercials

'Love of my life': Jason and Candice allegedly married six years ago and he claims to have had five surgeries during that time

Gawping, he had a million questions: 
'Did the doctor send you? Man you are eye candy! Woah. You're the 
prettiest woman I've ever seen.

'Are you a model? Who are you? What's your name?'

The answer blew his mind.

'I'm your wife,' she giggled.

In
a video that has now amassed more than 240,000 views, Mr Mortensen's 
jaw drops. And he's got a fair few more questions to ask.

'You're my wife?!' the former missionary gasps, 'Holy sh**! Dang. How long?'

Candice Mortensen, the blonde beauty behind the lens, tries to encourage her husband of six years to eat a cracker as he recovers in an unidentified hospital.

But he is too distracted. 

'It's hard baby, it's hard... Do we call each other baby?'

Dumbfounded, he clutches his head: 'Man I hit the jackpot!'

Unaware: He wakes up writhing around in pain and calling for medicine. When Candice speaks he turns to look

Baffled: He gawps at the bedside beauty wanting to know if she is a model. He cannot believe they are married

Now said to be recovered, Mr Mortensen, Vice President of sales at Oltuse Pharmaceuticals in Orem, Utah, is sticking to his every word.

The former missionary for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints said: 'I had a hernia repair to fix residual tears from a previous surgery.

'I wish I could remember this but I was definitely out of it.

'This was my fifth surgery within our six years of marriage and she's been by my side through all of it.

'In a previous surgery I suffered a severe complication and we didn't know if I'd ever function the same again.

'She is the love of my life.'

The couple live in Utah, where Mr Mortensen swapped medical school for business in 2010 after starting his own marketing company, Kangaroo Clips.

The start of the viral video purportedly shows a half-conscious Mr Mortensen rolling around in pain asking for medicine.

It is only when Candice offers to find a doctor that he turns to look at her.

For the next three minutes of video, which will go down in family history, pain is the least of Mr Mortensen's worries as he repeatedly exclaims: 'We're married?!'

He ogles at Candice, wanting to
know if they have children ('not yet'), have they kissed ('just eat
your cracker').

'I hit the jackpot': Jason Mortensen cannot believe his luck when he realises the bedside beauty is his wife, but did he recognise her all along?

After a few moments of contemplation he is 
inspired to investigate further: 'Let me see your face. Woah! Your teeth
are perfect!'

Much to his disappointment, she refuses to 'turn around'.

Catching sight of her left hand he says: 'Did I get you that ring? God I must have been... really liking you'.

Commenters flooded to praise the 'husband of the year' on YouTube after the video was posted on August 30.

One person said: 'That guy studied!'

Another commented: 'This man is a friggin genius!'

A yearning viewer said: 'Why can't I find a guy like this!'

Applauding Mrs Mortensen for her camerawork, one commenter said: 'I can't decide who is the genius of this operation. Jason, for saying this on camera or his wife for making sure it was documented!'

Not long after the video went viral, it received a flood of attention, but now some are doubting its validity. It has the looks of a hoax, according to a doctor who spoke to Slate.

Explaining that there are two types of amnesia, Dr. Larry Squire, a psychologist at the University of California-San Diego, says that neither of them would likely cause the type of memory loss allegedly suffered by Mr Mortensen.

'The first type, psychogenic amnesia, is a psychiatric condition that can involve retrograde memory loss, but isn't associated with surgery, says Dr Squire. 'The second, which is similar to Alzheimer's, can be caused by a loss of oxygen during surgery, but mainly leads to difficulty learning new information,' he adds.

Explaining that while retrograde memory (that of past events) can occur, Dr Squire says it is unheard of for a six-year marriage to be wiped clean from a person's memory.

'It would not affect something so salient in a person's life,' said Dr Squire.

Another strike against the sensational video's legitimacy is a head shot found of the suddenly coherent Mr Mortensen on an acting audition website, the Slate post points out.

One final item of note, the former actor has only one video uploaded to his YouTube account, which Slate notes 'employs the easy-to-remember username 'UCx-PiDcTqvNUoyNHY5R7RIA.'
