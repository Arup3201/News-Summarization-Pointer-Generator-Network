Republic of Ireland captain Robbie Keane was dropped for the first time since June 2001 for his side's Euro 2016 qualifier against Scotland on Friday night. 

The Green Army's all-time leading goalscorer was among the substitutes during a feisty 1-0 defeat against their Group D rivals at Celtic Park.

The last time Keane was started on the bench for his country was a World Cup qualifier against Estonia in June 2001. Ireland won 2-0.

The La Galaxy striker has 65 goals in all competitions for his country but the in-form Shane Long was preferred

The LA Galaxy striker was brought on in the 78th minute by Martin O'Neill as Ireland looked for an equaliser against the Scots.

Before the game the Ireland manager was full of praise for Keane: 'Robbie's been splendid for us, absolutely splendid. 

'He scored a hat-trick (against Gibraltar) and he's a goalscorer.

Manager Martin O'Neill said that Shane Long's pace was the deciding factor in his choice to bench Keane

'Shane (Long) of course scored a couple of goals at the weekend. He's in good form and looking forward to it.

'He has a little bit of pace up there and I think he can stretch them so he gets the nod.

'I'm sure that Robbie will be champing at the bit to get on the field.'
