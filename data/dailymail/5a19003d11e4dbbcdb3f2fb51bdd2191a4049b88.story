Meet the barking mad cat who thinks he's a dog. 

Teddi, a six-year-old Siberian tom, is able to jump through hoops, perform various greetings and weave in and out of poles just like a trained hound.

Owner Barbara Connor, 55, has taught him how to do 20 tricks, all more traditionally associated with canines.

Her cat's antics have been viewed by thousands of people from around the globe on the moggy's dedicated Youtube channel called 'Teddi's Tricks'.

Barbara, who originally comes from Falkirk, Scotland, and now lives in Malaga, Spain, is even considering entering her pet in talent competitions or even take it to Hollywood.

She said: 'I have a lot of fun thinking up creative ways for him to do things. If he thinks he's a dog, that would be my fault.

'Knowing I'd always enjoyed training dogs, a friend said I should try to train cats.

'I tried teaching Teddi to stand on his back legs and beg and, to my amazement, he picked it up within two days.

'That inspired me to be a bit more ambitious. I made a joke video for friends, where Teddi was demonstrating appropriate cross cultural greetings for different situations.

'He could shake hands or give a high five like Americans and he could kiss you on the cheek like the Spaniards.'

Woof: Teddi the six-year-old Siberian tom, is the cat who thinks he's a dog with his tricks proving a big internet hit

Agile: But Teddi still has the balance and agility of a cat as he walks across this beam

Teddi is the offspring of a stray cat which Barbara took into her home shortly after arriving in Spain.

The cat, named Tamba, regularly followed her home, eventually taking up residence with Barbara who then found out it was pregnant.

She trained Teddi using a clicker which is often used by animal trainers in movies and was surprised at how easy it was to get Teddi to play along.

She said: 'How long it takes to teach Teddi new tricks depends on what type of skill it is. Giving the high five or shaking hands, he had them within a couple of days.

'But some of them like where he goes round and round in a circle, that took him four months to do it without tempting him with a treat.

'He loves climbing up on high things, and he has the loudest purr I've ever heard.

'It's been said, though, that Siberians can be kind of 'dog like'. He does have some of those tendencies, always coming to meet me at the door like a dog would do.

'He's currently practising his piano skills for a new music video. He's obviously banging about on the keyboard but he looks the part.'
