Tragic: Adam Atkinson, 20, was killed in the accident at the HM Martinique hotel in Magaluf, Majorca, in April

The father of a British tourist who died after falling down three flights of stairs while drunk has hit out at cheap alcohol deals.

Adam Atkinson, 20, from Castleford, West Yorkshire, was killed in the accident at the HM Martinique hotel in Magaluf, Majorca, in April.

His father Alan Atkinson has called for tougher laws governing the selling of cheap alcohol in tourist resorts popular with young people.

Since Adam's death, four more Britons have fallen from a hotel ledge or balcony in Magaluf. Two of the falls were fatal.

Mr Atkinson told New! magazine: 'There have been four accidents like Adam's in Magaluf since.
These kids aren't looking for trouble. They are naive youngsters living
life to the full and taking advantage of cheap alcohol deals.

'There should be tighter laws on 
cheap deals and binge drinking. Young people going on holiday to these 
places need protecting, before it's too late.'

Adam
and his friends had spent hours drinking at their hotel on their first 
day in Magaluf on April 16 when they headed out on the town, Mr Atkinson
said.

He added: 'They went
to one bar where they paid just ten euros to drink as much as they 
liked in two hours - and they got through a lot.

'Then they hit karaoke bars, knocking back more.

'We
believe Adam may have been planning to jump out on his friends when 
they arrived back at the hotel - he had taken the stairs, they had got 
in the lift.

'But he lost his footing and plunged three floors to the hard concrete below.

'He was enjoying himself and hadn't meant to risk his life. The poor, poor boy didn't deserve to die.

'We
are waiting for the toxicology report on Adam, and I dread to think 
what it might tell us. His friends think he knocked back at least 20 
vodkas.'

Just three days after Adam fell to his death, Benjamin Harper, 28, from Twickenham, plunged from a a fifth-floor balcony of the Sol Antillas Barbados hotel at the resort.

Two
weeks after that, Charlotte Faris, 23, from Codicote, Hertfordshire, 
fell to her death from the balcony of her room at the Teix hotel just 
moments after checking in.

On
May 25, Chantelle Serginson, 24, from Middlesbrough was left in 
intensive care and fractured her skull and legs after falling from the 
sixth floor of the Hotel Marina Barricuda.

And,
two days later, Daniel Geary, 23, was hospitalised after landing on his
back after falling from his second floor room at the HM Martinique 
hotel, the same hotel where Adam died in a fall.

Last year more than a dozen Britons fell from hotels in Spain and three died.

Several
of them were involved in what Spaniards have dubbed ‘balconing’ – in 
which young people attempt to jump from one balcony to another.
