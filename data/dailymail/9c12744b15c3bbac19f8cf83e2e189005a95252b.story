Justification: Cressida Dick has written to the Society of Editors justifying the Met's investigation and methods

The officer in charge of Scotland Yard’s inquiries in the wake of  the phone-hacking scandal  has been forced to defend her force’s tactics.

Questions have been raised over the scope of Operation Elveden, the multi-million pound criminal inquiry into alleged bribes paid by journalists to public officials, after it targeted police officers who have ‘leaked’ information with no payment involved.

Those concerns follow mounting  controversy over the dawn arrests of journalists – including an ex-editor who was seven months pregnant – and reporters left facing many months before discovering whether they will face charges.

The arrests have also prompted fears, after the Leveson inquiry, that informal contact between police officers and the Press is being outlawed.

Now Assistant Commissioner Cressida Dick has written to the Society of Editors justifying the Met’s investigations and methods.

In her unsolicited letter explaining the Elveden operation she insists: ‘The investigations being carried out do not mean that the Met wants or intends to stop officers talking to journalists.’

Defending the much-criticised ‘7am door knocks’, Miss Dick says there are ‘sound operational reasons for the times of day we elect to arrest people’.

Miss Dick said there was ‘genuine concern’ by police over the time those arrested have been on bail but said there have been ‘millions of emails, documentation, complex communications data and trails of financial transactions that require painstaking analysis’. 

She concluded: ‘An unintended and, I hope, short-term consequence of this may be a negative effect on relations between police and journalists.

‘This is unfortunate but in no way undermines the value the Metropolitan Police Service puts on the role of a free and investigative Press in a democratic society – indeed this investigation is the result of such journalism. We want open, professional and trusting relationships between our officers and journalists.’ 

Bob Satchwell, executive director of the Society of Editors, said: ‘While I am glad she has recognised the need to give an explanation, areas of concern remain.

‘We should all recognise that the police sometimes have a difficult job to do, but early-morning knocks on the doors of journalists still require some justification.’
