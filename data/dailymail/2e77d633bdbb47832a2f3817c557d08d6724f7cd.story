Paul Lambert took the astonishing step of ending his six-year association with trusted aide Ian Culverhouse on Tuesday after a complete breakdown in the pair’s relationship.

Aston Villa confirmed that assistant manager Culverhouse and head of footballing operations Gary Karsa had been relieved of their duties pending an internal investigation.

Sportsmail understands the move by Lambert came after a heated exchange in the dressing room following Saturday’s defeat at Crystal Palace.

Showdown: Aston Villa chief executive Paul Faulkner (right) met with Paul Lambert at the training ground

Lambert’s working relationship with 
Culverhouse is said to have deteriorated so much that the pair have 
hardly spoken in recent weeks, causing disruption to  Villa’s 
preparation for games.

The 
atmosphere at the club’s Bodymoor Heath training ground has been 
described as ‘poisonous’ and Culverhouse is said to have fallen out with
 other members of the backroom team and senior players.

Karsa
 is also said to have had a turbulent relationship with members of staff
 at Villa and the pair were suspended by chief executive Paul Faulkner 
after Lambert decided the make-up of his coaching team was no longer fit
 for purpose.

Despite the 
club’s official statement indicating the pair have only been suspended, 
it is understood Culverhouse and Karsa have no future at the club. 
Lambert’s position is believed not to be under threat.

Under pressure: Lambert's Aston Villa side have lost seven out of their past 10 Premier League matches

Lambert
 and Culverhouse first joined forces at Colchester in 2008, before 
leaving for Norwich City in 2009 and steering the Canaries into the top 
flight. Their success persuaded Villa owner Randy Lerner to appoint them
 after sacking Alex McLeish in 2012.

Villa
 have promoted former player and crowd favourite Gordon Cowans, 55, and 
goalkeeper Shay Given, 37, to assist Lambert while the club carry out 
their investigation.

Lambert
 said: ‘I’m delighted to have Gordon and Shay to assist me in preparing 
the team for Saturday (against Southampton), which is what the whole 
group is focused on.’

The 
breakdown in relations between Lambert and Culverhouse has coincided 
with a dreadful run for the club that has seen them slip closer to the 
relegation zone.

Lots to think about: Villa lost their fourth Premier League game on the spin at Crystal Palace on Saturday

The Midlands club have picked up just seven points from a possible 30 and are currently on a run of four defeats.

Cowans
 said: ‘The manager has asked me to step up to assist him at this time 
and I’ll do my utmost for the club and the manager in helping prepare 
the team for Saturday’s game.’

Given
 added: ‘As players, it’s important that each and every one of us take 
responsibility right now and I’m delighted to play my part in helping 
the manager and the team go and try to win on Saturday.’
