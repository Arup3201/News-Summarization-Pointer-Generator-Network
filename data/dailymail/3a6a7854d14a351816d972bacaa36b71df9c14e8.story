After more than a decade together, Misty May-Treanor and Kerri Walsh Jennings are going out on top, ending their partnership with yet another gold medal.

The pair, two of the most recognisable faces in the sport, won their third gold medal yesterday at London’s Horse Guards Parade.

Between Athens, Beijing and London, they are undefeated, having won all but one set on the world's top stage.

Following the match, May-Treanor,35, said she will retire from the sport to spend more time with her husband, Los Angeles Dodgers catcher Matt Treanor, and start a family.

She said: 'This is my last match. Beach volleyball's not going to be my career anymore... It's time for me to be a wife.

‘I want to be a mom and share time with my family. All of us as athletes sacrifice more on the family end than people realize. And it's getting back to that. My mind says it's time. My body says it's time. And it's the right time.'

Matt Treanor was not in the crowd in London, but that doesn’t mean he  wasn’t watching.

Before the Dodgers game against the Colorado Rockies in LA yesterday, he anxiously sat in front of a computer in the team's clubhouse to view the action on a weak internet connection that made him miss the final few points.

'I'm just real proud of her,' he said in the Dodger Stadium dugout. 'I am sure she is much more comfortable on the court than I am watching her.'

He said that he couldn’t be happier, and admitted that he shed tears of joy as his wife and her longtime teammate won the match against compatriots Jen Kessy and April Ross.

‘Tears didn’t flow right away because there were a bunch of people in the room… To me it’s a swarming effect. There’s all these thoughts and emotions that come into your head and a lot of it is just about Misty. It’s about what she wanted to do and sacrificed and for her to accomplish that.'

When asked if she was the best athlete in the family, Treanor said: ‘Yeah, I’ve been saying that for the last eight years.'

Walsh Jennings, 33, who lifted herself into the stands to celebrate with her family yesterday, has said she will keep competing, but it is unclear whom she will play with.

Family in focus: Walsh Jennings had two children after winning their second gold medal in the Beijing games

After winning gold in Beijing in 2008, May-Treanor and Walsh Jennings took some time off.

Walsh Jennings, had two children with fellow beach volleyballer Casey Jennings – Joseph and Sundance.

May-Treanor competed on Dancing With the Stars, but was forced to drop out of the celebrity dance reality show after tearing her Achilles tendon.

She thought she was done with volleyball for good, until a 2010 tournament revealed a hunger for more Olympic gold.

Unbeatable: The team of Walsh Jennings and May-Treanor was the first to win two gold medals in a row, let alone three

She told NBC’s Bob Costas: 'There was this tournament that came about. I played with Kerri - I don’t know if I should’ve been quite out there yet. It was USA vs Brazil [and I was] still playing at a good level after the injury - I was like, "OK I’ll come back."'

May-Treanor competed with another partner while Walsh Jennings had her second child, but she wished to end the journey with the person she wanted to finish it with, 'and that was Kerri.'

But on the road to their third Olympics, the duo realised their relationship had become strained, and they sought professional help.

The St Louis Post-Dispatch reported earlier this month that May-Treanor and Walsh Jennings sought couples therapy to bolster their relationship before heading to London.

Walsh Jennings, 33, told the paper: 'We were in a funk, mentally. It wasn't physical at all. We were just in a weird place.'

What followed were several sessions with famed sports psychologist Michael Gervais, who helped them learn how to work better as a team.

What transpired was an unstoppable partnership that stunned the world, and even had Ross and Kessy in awe of the Olympic icons.

'I know how hard it is to win one tournament. And the amount of tournaments they've won is crazy,' said Kessy, who took the silver with Ross in their Olympic debuts.

She added: 'For them to do it for years and years and to be on top is just really impressive. We learn a lot from them.'
