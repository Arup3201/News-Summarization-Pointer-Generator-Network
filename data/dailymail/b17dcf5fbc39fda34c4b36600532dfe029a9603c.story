A seven-year-old girl was attacked by foot-long rat that bit her face and arm as she lay sleeping in her bed.

Francesca Williams' parents found their daughter covered in blood when she screamed for help as the large rodent bit her cheek and arm.

The large rat left puncture wounds before scurrying away and hiding under the child's bed.

Bleeding: The foot-long rat bit Francesca Williams' face as she lay sleeping in her bed

Vermin: The family's dog Hattie sniffed out and killed the rat, which had been hiding under the child's bed

Wounds: Wendy Williams said she found her daughter covered in blood with bites to her arm, pictured, and face

Her mother Wendy said she and husband Darren were woken at about 2.30am by their daughter's cries but thought she had a bad dream.

But when they looked in on her they found her face and arm covered in blood.

Mrs Williams, from Symonds Yat, Herefordshire, said: 'She was crying and said a big brown animal had bitten her.

'She said she woke up after feeling something crawling on her leg and when she moved it bit her.'

The 35-year-old said her husband used their dog to sniff out the rat.

She said: 'We could see from the blood on her 
face and arm that something had happened so my husband Darren went to 
get our dog Hattie to see if he could find anything.

'The dog immediately sniffed the rat 
out. It was hiding underneath Francesca's bed.

'Hattie killed it and 
Darren threw it outside.'

Francesca has been traumatised that she could not sleep in her room for almost a week after the attack last Thursday.

Mrs Williams said although they live in a rural area, they rarely see rats and do not know how the rodent got into their house.

She said: 'There have been no droppings, nests 
or signs of any rats in our home so we can only assume it got in that 
day, through the cat flap perhaps.

'You just never think a rat would come into your home, let alone bite your child. It's unbelievable.

'I thought she was having a bad dream 
or couldn't find her teddy, never in a million years did I think 
Francesca would have been bitten by a rat.'

Mrs Williams took her daughter to the doctors for a check up.

Traumatised: Francesca was so upset that she refused to sleep in her own room for a week after the attack

Hero: Francesca's dog Hattie sniffed out the foot-long rat from under her bed and killed it

She said: 'You hear about rats carrying diseases
and so we worried Francesca may have caught an infection but she's been
to the doctors and has been given some antibiotics and luckily 
everything is okay.

'It could have been so much worse, what if it had bitten her near her eye or if the rat had bitten a baby, it's frightening.'

In November, toddler Lolly Molyneux was also bitten in her bedroom at the family home in Camden, North London.

Her mother Lindsey said the large rat bit the 16-year-old girl on the wrist leaving deep wounds.

They did not know what had happened until a foot-long rat scuttled past, which then escaped.
