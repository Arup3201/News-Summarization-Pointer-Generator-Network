A six-year-old boy saved his family from a burning house thanks to being up late playing his Xbox.

Seven people were inside Taylor Hendrix's grandparent's home, in Brownsville, Tennessee, when the fire broke out in the early hours of the morning.

But little Taylor managed to raise the alarm thanks to being awake playing computer games.

Brave: Six-year-old Taylor Hendrix was awake playing his Xbox when his grandparent's home went up in flames

Firefighters have described the rescue on February 14 as a miracle.

'It started in the attic and came down the chimney,' Taylor told wmctv.com.

Taylor's grandmother, Paula Brown, said if Taylor had not been up the family would not have got out alive.

She said: 'He came in and he was screaming papa, papa the house is on fire.

Rescue: Mike Brown tried to put the flames out with a water hose but the house was destroyed in minutes

Destroyed: The family lost everything in their 100-year-old home in Brownsville, Tennessee

Nothing left: Within 10 minutes the family home was burnt to the ground but luckily everyone got out alive thanks to six-year-old Taylor Hendrix

'Thank God he was up. He's my little hero.

'My grandson saved my life. He most certainly did.'

Mrs Brown and her husband, Mike, were all inside the house with five of their grandchildren.

Mr Brown, a meter reader in Brownsville, tried to use a water hose to put the fire out but it was too late and the 100-year-old house was completely destroyed in the blaze.

He said: 'It happened so quick, seven minutes, maybe 10 at the most...it was all done.

'We've lost everything. Everything we own.'

The community is now rallying together to help the family following the fire.
