One is Hollywood royalty and the other off-spring of a European regal dynasty - but it was far from like-minds when author Christina Oxenberg was seated next to Oscar-winner Gwyneth Paltrow at a literary fundraiser at the weekend.

Actress-turned-author Paltrow was undoubtedly the main attraction at the East Hampton Library’s Authors Night on Saturday which she attended to promote her cookbook It's All Good.

Paltrow, 40, graced the event with her rarely-seen children Apple and Moses - along with the prerequisite troop of bodyguards. The Oscar-winner's husband, Coldplay frontman Chris Martin, was also reportedly at the event but typically declined to be pictured with his wife.

Author Christina Oxenberg, who was 
seated at the next table promoting her new book of short stories Life Is Short, wrote a 
hilarious blog post following her close encounter with the A-lister who she deemed 'sleek vegan neighbor'.

Literary talent: Authors Christina Oxenberg and Jay McInerney quipped that the authors event on Saturday had been 'hijacked by movie stars'

Oxenberg
wrote: 'Due to the inflexibility of the alphabet I had the questionable
good fortune to be seated directly beside Gwyneth Paltrow.'

As
her spot at the event was quickly overshadowed by fans eager to bask in
Paltrow's celebrity glow, Ms Oxenberg decided to protest by off-setting
Ms Paltrow's sermons on all-things healthy with plates of 'sloppy 
hamburgers and stinky steak sandwiches' on her writers' table.

The
author claimed that she was blocked from returning to her table with 
the fast food by Paltrow's burly bodyguards and ended up crawling 
underneath to get back to her seat.

Oxenberg explained:
'I was forced to crawl under the table. And there I sat with my meat 
products, wafting the excellent smells toward my sleek vegan neighbor.

'She ignored the siren smells of 
protein. We never did say hello, although I did try to sell my book to 
her sleek vegan children. No bites.'

Ms Oxenberg on Tuesday posted a picture on her Facebook page of Gwynnie and daughter Apple surrounded by avid fans.

While
Paltrow is actually no longer vegan and has succumbed to eating white 
meat and fish, she avoids red meat and gluten like the plague.

Here come the A-list: Paltrow (with husband Chris Martin hidden behind the blacked-out SUV) roll up for the library charity event

Paltrow told US Weekly
earlier this year that it was thanks to her friend Leonardo DiCaprio 
that she stopped eating red meat.

She might not be as famous as her nemesis Ms Paltrow but Christina Oxenberg could drop a rather powerful name or two if she so wished.

Christina Oxenberg is the second daughter of Princess Elizabeth of Yugoslavia, a renowned beauty, who was exiled following a 1941 coup in the country.

Her mother - a second cousin to Prince Charles - married New York City businessman Howard Oxenberg but divorced when Christina was three (but not before rumors that the author's real father was JFK, according to People). Princess Elizabeth later came close to marrying Richard Burton. She also had a brief foray selling perfume called Princess Elizabeth on QVC.

Christina's sister Catherine Oxenberg is best known for playing Amanda Carrington on the soap opera Dynasty.

The author was once married to artist Damian Elwes - the brother of actor Cary Elwes who starred in the horror movies Saw.

She told the magazine: 'I haven't 
eaten red meat in 20 years, and although Leo's not totally responsible, 
he definitely planted a seed.'

It's All Good, written by Paltrow and Julia Turshen, a seasoned cookbook author and journalist, is a tome to the actress's 'elimination diet', described as 'no coffee, no alcohol, no dairy, no eggs, no sugar, no shellfish, no deep-water fish, no wheat, no meat, no soy, nothing processed at all!'

Miss Paltrow also said recently that her family’s gluten-free diet left the children with a ‘specific hunger 
that comes with avoiding carbs’.  

But she dismissed criticism about her
love for faddish diets.

She said: ‘I was really lucky to have two 
healthy children, and I enjoy raising them and watching these amazing 
human beings start to come out and be themselves.’

Along
with Paltrow and celebrity friends Alec and Hilaria Baldwin, the 
library fundraiser was attended by authors Jay McInerney, Robert Caro, 
Nelson de Mille and A.M. Holmes.

Literary veteran McInerney, who was at 
the event to promote his third wine book The Juice, also had some 
acerbic words about the overbearing presence of Paltrow and her posse.

The Bright Lights, Big City author, 
linking to friend Ms Oxenberg's post, tweeted: 'Authors Night at East 
Hampton Library hijacked by movie stars with ghost-written cookbooks.'

Wise words: Bright Lights, Big City author Jay McInerney passes comment on Paltrow and friends

Not Gwynnie's biggest fans... Sex And The City author retweeted Ms Oxenberg's article

Her friend, Sex And The City author Candace Bushnell, retweeted the article
today with the words: 'Author's worst nightmare: sitting next to 
Gwyneth at a signing. Hysterical.'

Ms
Oxenberg replied: '@CandaceBushnell I miss you my friend. We must do it
together next year, I can change my name to Bushenberg so we can sit 
side by side.'

The writer's brush with the trappings Hollywood royalty may have left her rankled as she plays down her own connections to genuine European royalty.

Christina Oxenberg is the second daughter of Princess Elizabeth of Yugoslavia, a second cousin to Prince Charles.
