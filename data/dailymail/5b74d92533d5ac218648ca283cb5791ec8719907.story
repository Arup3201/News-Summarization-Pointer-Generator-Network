Scotland's central defensive duo have vowed they are ready to do what Germany couldn’t and stop Poland’s rampant goal-machine led by the fearsome Robert Lewandowski.

The Bayern Munich striker laid on the second goal for Sebastian Mila in a shock 2-0 win over the world champions in Warsaw on Saturday night as the Germans sank to their first qualifying defeat since October 2007.

The free-scoring Poles now top Group D on goal difference from Ireland with a 100-per-cent record from two games, scoring nine and conceding none.

But Scotland centre back Russell Martin insists Lewandowski and Co hold no fears. And his defensive partner, Grant Hanley, is also confident Gordon Strachan’s Scots can handle what is thrown at them in the Polish capital on Tuesday night.

After Scotland’s 1-0 win over Georgia on Saturday, Martin said: ‘Robert Lewandowski is one of the best in the world in his position – but it’s up to us to nullify his threat.

‘And I’ve competed week in week out against guys of his quality in the Premier League so I know what’s coming.

‘Luis Suarez was the toughest - he is just a brilliant player. And with Scotland we kept a clean sheet against Croatia and Mario Mandzukic. I’ve also played against Christian Benteke of Belgium and Germany have good players too.

‘Grant Hanley and myself are both desperate to get back to the Premier League as soon as possible and tests like these against Poland and Lewandowski are tests you need to pass. We need to prove we are still ready for it, that we can compete at that level.

‘I’ve not seen as much of Lewandowski as the others strikers (in the English Premier League) because he plays in Germany but the staff will make sure we see all about him before the game. We will be prepared. There will be no excuses.

‘But Lewandowski’s not Poland’s only threat – and it’s going to be a team effort to stop him. But we will be ready. And we go there confident after getting a clean sheet against Georgia.’

Hanley also welcomes the challenge in Warsaw after shutting out the Georgians at Ibrox. The Blackburn Rovers skipper also takes confidence from Scotland winning a friendly 1-0 out in Poland in March, thanks to a Scott Brown goal, even though he and Lewandowski were both missing that night.

‘We know Poland have got the big name in their team but we are going there with a game plan,’ said the 22-year-old.

‘And, hopefully, we’ll get something out of the game.

‘Of course, playing against Robert Lewandowski will be difficult but we’re confident we can handle it. We’ll give them the respect that they’re due but we’ ve got to remember that we coped with Mario Mandzukic. It’s going to be a test, though.

‘We’d be happy if David Marshall doesn’t have a save to make in Poland (like against Georgia) but we know it will be a different game out there.

‘I wouldn’t like to say whether a draw would be a good result over there but, with the confidence we have now, we’ve got to go into it looking to produce another performance like this one and then who knows what might happen?

‘I wasn’t involved when we won in Poland in March but that result has given the boys belief. We have players who can make an impact and, with a wee bit of luck, I don’t think we’ll be far away.

‘There’s no reason for us to be afraid of them because we’re playing with no fear.’
