A Russian petrol station worker has been given a bravery award after stopping an explosion at a garage.

Arsene Fitsulaev managed to seal the valves of a damaged fuel tanker just before the petrol surrounding it caught fire, preventing a huge explosion.

The incident begins as a black car attempts a routine manouvre on a garage forecourt.

A man has been given a bravery award in Russia after dashing into a cloud of petrol fumes and fuel in order to prevent a damaged tank from exploding

Accident: The debacle begins when a hapless driver tries to turn around on the garage forecourt

Damage: He misjudges his manouvre, clipping a fuel pipe on this tanker causing it to rupture

However the bungling driver misjudges his turn, clipping the fuel tap on a tanker sitting in front of him.

The pipe twists to one side, releasing highly flammable gas and leaking petrol all over the floor.

As the motorist makes a hasty getaway Arsene can be seen running into shot, plunging into the midst of the toxic fumes in order to get to the taps in time.

Not sticking around: However the motorist quickly flees the scene leaving gas and petrol leaking out

Into action: With the driver on his way out, Arsene comes running over in order to fix the tank

Fearless: Without a thought for his safety Arsene runs into the flammable smog in order to turn off the taps

Without a thought for his own life, Arsene can be seen desperately trying to turn off the fuel taps while surrounded by the gas.

After a few seconds he has the valves safely sealed off, which is just as well because moments later the petrol reaches the road in front of the station, and is ignited by a passing car.

In a fraction of a second the gas and petrol ignite, starting a blaze which completely consumes the garage forecourt, engulfing a parked car and gutting it.

Fixed: With moments to spare Arsene seals off the valves before retreating back to safety

Just in time: Within moments a spark has ignited the fuel sending flames rushing across the parking lot

Burning: It takes milliseconds for the fuel to ignite, engulfing the parked car and gutting it

But as bad as it looks the incident could have been much worse had it not been for Arsene's quick thinking, because when the petrol and gas set alight it was dispersed and so simply burned away.

If the flame had been able to track back up an open valve and into the tank where there was more fuel confined to a tight space, it would almost certainly have caused a huge explosion.

In recognition of his efforts, Arsene's local rescue team in Kaspiysk have given him a bravery award.

Consumed: The flames surround the tank, but luckily there is no explosion

Lucky escape: Because the gas and fuel outside the tanker was dispersed it simply burned away, but had the fuel inside caught fire in the confined space it would have exploded

Burned: The damaging effects of the flames can be seen on this car which was unfortunately parked nearby
