Michael West asked his wife 'Do you want to die?' as he pointed a knife at her

A 71-year-old man who believed his younger Thai bride was cheating on him and treating him like a 'cash cow' confronted her with a meat cleaver, a court heard.

Michael West later told police his wife Bangon, 50, had been using him as a 'walking ATM' for herself and her family in Thailand.

He complained he had spent £24,000 on a house for her next door to her sister in Thailand and more than £60,000 on her and other members of her family.

'All I am is a cash cow, a walking ATM,' he said. 'I have been taken for a fool.'

He said although he and his wife had separated late last year she was still seeing him each weekend for sex and happily accepting expensive gifts from him for her birthday and Christmas.

West, of Longlevens, Gloucester, admitted violent harassment of his wife and being in possession of a knife in a public place - the Thai restaurant where she worked in Gloucester.

He was jailed for a year.

Prosecutor Janine Wood said the marriage had been deteriorating for several years and in 2010 West was cautioned for cutting up her clothing after a row.

Last year in October or November they parted because the relationship had deteriorated so much, she said.

But on January 4 this year he went into the kitchen of the restaurant where she was working in Southgate Street, Gloucester, backed her up against a fridge, grabbed her hair and produced a small knife from his jacket pocket.

He asked her: 'Do you want to die?' and pointed the knife at her. He let her go and put the knife back in his pocket but then pulled out a meat cleaver and said 'Do you want this one?'

'He says he loved her deeply and struggled to come to terms with the break up of their relationship at the end of last year'

Lloyd Jenkins, defending 

Mrs Wood said 'She was scared and ran into the public area of the restaurant where she managed to take a photo of him on her mobile phone showing him with the cleaver.' He also had blood on his hand, she said.

Mrs West managed then to film him for fifteen minutes as he made verbal threats and gestures to her in the restaurant, added Ms Wood.

Mrs West did not report the incident to police and was in the restaurant two days later when her husband arrived and picked up a knife which he put in his pocket.

She ran out of the restaurant to avoid him and she then called the police. He was arrested at 2.20pm on January 7 in the Regal pub in Gloucester and found to have a small knife in his pocket.

In a statement, Mrs West asked the court to pass a sentence which would help him overcome his alcohol addiction.

Lloyd Jenkins, defending, said West now finally accepts that the marriage has broken down.

'He split from his first wife in 2004 after she cheated on him at the end of a 35-year-marriage,' said Mr Jenkins. 'They have two children who are in the public gallery.

'That left him somewhat vulnerable. He suffered a breakdown. He then met Bangon and they married seven to eight years ago.

'He says he loved her deeply and struggled to come to terms with the break up of their relationship at the end of last year.

'She had moved out of their home in June or July but every weekend she would go back to him and there would be sexual intercourse.

'He was getting mixed messages. He was struggling to cope with that.

'In 2010 he had been cautioned for criminal damage for cutting up her clothes. That was when she had been away in Ilford with a boyfriend cheating on him.

'He says he was a walking ATM. He said he spent £24,000 building her a house next door to her sister in Thailand, he gave her sons £9,000 to buy taxis to set up business out there.

'He says he has spent in excess of £60,000 on her and her family. "All I am is a cash cow, a walking ATM" he says, and "I have been played for a fool."

'On December 13 he gave her £220 worth of gifts for her birthday and she accepted them. On 24th December he gave her Christmas presents and again she took them.

'She is a 50-year-old woman who takes his money and gifts, goes to his bed once a week but then has another agenda, if I may put it that way. He is a jilted man, he is a broken man.

'He is a man who worked hard all his life and has a supportive family around him. He will be vulnerable in custody because of his age and his high blood pressure.'

West Judge Jamie Tabor QC said: 'I am certainly not going to cast aspersions on your wife because it would be unfair to do so. What I am prepared to do is accept that you felt you were being used.

'Whether that is true or not is secondary. You have an alcohol problem and when people with alcohol problems arm themselves with knives the consequences are very often fatal or near fatal.'

As well as the 12 months jail term the judge made a restraining order banning West from contacting his wife or going to the restaurant where she works.
