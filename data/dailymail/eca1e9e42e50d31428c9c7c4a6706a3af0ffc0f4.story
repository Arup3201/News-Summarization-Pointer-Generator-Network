Olympiacos want to take Fulham striker Bryan Ruiz on a free transfer.

The Costa Rica striker was a £10m signing and has a year left on contract.

Ruiz impressed for surprise package Costa Rica at the World Cup, captaining the side and scoring twice in Brazil, but his spell at Fulham has largely been considered a flop.

With the Cottagers in the Championship next year, it is thought Ruiz would welcome a move abroad on the back of a good performance on the international stage.

But Fulham could be reluctant to let their fourth-most expensive signing of all-time leave for nothing.

Meanwhile, Barnsley goalkeeper Luke Steele, 29, is in talks with Panathinaikos who have offered a two-year deal and Millwall have signed striker Ricardo Fuller.
