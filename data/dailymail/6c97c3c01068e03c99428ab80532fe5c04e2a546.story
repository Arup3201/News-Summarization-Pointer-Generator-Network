A group of West Ham supporters have responded to racist Chelsea fans with a parody video of a black man being welcomed on board a train.

Footage showing Chelsea fans repeatedly blocking a black man from getting on a train in Paris amid chants of 'we're racist, we're racist and that's the way we like it' prompted a public outcry.

The spoof video, filmed ahead of the West Ham - Tottenham Hotspur derby earlier today, shows the Hammers standing up to racism and showing how they would have handled the situation.

In the clip a black man is seen walking up to a train door saying: 'This is how we do it at West Ham' before asking a white man: 'Can I get on the train, sir?'

Thousands have shared the video and comedian Russell Brand tweeted: 'Comedy as a weapon against hate. Very funny.'

The video was posted on Twitter by Arron Thomas today with the caption 'claret and blue is all that matters' and has since received more than 1,400 retweets.

Daniel Cook tweeted: 'This is priceless. Way to stand up to racism in football. 

Andrew Ellis tweeted: 'You've made my day.' 

Marcus Wilkinson said: 'Hilarious. How to let a black man on a train. Stand up to racism.' 

The victim of the racist incident, Souleymane S, made an official police complaint and said he would like those responsible 'found, punished and locked up'. 

In the footage the Parisian can be seen twice trying to enter the tightly packed carriage, but both times being shoved back out through the train door.

He said what happened had not much hurt him physically, but had damaged his morale 'a lot', meaning he will now only use his car and not the Paris underground. 

Three men being sought by police over the alleged racist incident involving Chelsea football fans have been identified, detectives have revealed.

Scotland Yard released images of the men they believed they were among a group of supporters who allegedly pushed a black man off the train and chanted a racist song in France on Tuesday.

The Metropolitan Police said the three men had now been identified and the force was liaising with the French authorities. None of the men sought by Scotland Yard have been arrested.

Five people have so far been suspended from Chelsea's Stamford Bridge ground following investigations into the incident.

The club has reiterated its promise to ban for life anyone proved to have been involved in the altercation and is helping police in the UK and Paris.

Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho said the club were 'appalled' by the racial abuse, adding that owner Roman Abramovich was also 'disgusted'. 

West Ham drew 2-2 against Tottenham Hotspur today at White Hart Lane.
