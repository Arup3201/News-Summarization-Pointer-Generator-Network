After their first attempt at marriage, you'd think they would have had enough.

But these persistent pensioners have got married again - almost 50 years after they first tied the knot.

Valeria Pock, 69, and Gyorgy Bogyay, 82, met and married in 1964 and had a daughter before getting divorced 18 years later.

They have been living together as friends for the last two decades and yesterday the couple from Plymouth, Devon, walked down the aisle to exchange vows and pick up where they left off 49 years ago.

Rolling back the years: Valeria Pock, 69, and Gyorgy Bogyay, 82, are pictured marrying for the first time in 1964, and re-marrying yesterday after divorcing each other in between

Gyorgy first came to the UK in 1957 fleeing his home country of Hungary following the revolution the previous year.

A few years later having qualified for UK citizenship he put an advert in a Hungarian newspaper stating he was looking for a wife.

Valeria who was living in the former Yugoslavian Republic replied to the notice and they became pen pals.

'We were writing to each other about a year and a half,' Valeria said.

'He asked me if I would like to marry him and I said yes, so he sent me a one-way ticket to come to England.

'My parents were very upset my sister didn't want me to go.

'She said 'You're so beautiful, you can find any man you like in Yugoslavia so why go to England?'

'She said I should write him a letter and say I can't come as I was ill.

'So I did, but when he received it he didn't believe it.'

Gyorgy took a train from London to Belgrade and sent Valeria a telegram asking her to meet him at the train station at 8am the next morning.

They went back to England and just a few days later, on May 9, 1964, married at a register office in Reading.

Happy day: The pair grew apart and divorced after 18 years of marriage but moved back in together in the early 1990s

Valeria said: 'The funny thing is he never even asked me if I would come and I never asked if he would have me.

'It was just so natural, we just got hold of each other's hands.'

Gyorgy added: 'When I saw her I just said she was so beautiful. I said I will spend the rest of my life with her.'

In 1966 Valeria fell pregnant with a son but suffered a miscarriage.

The couple had better luck four years later when their daughter named Valerie was born.

But after 18 years the marriage broke down. Valeria says they just drifted apart and they were divorced in 1982.

Both moved on to find new people but neither could make it stick.

'My marriage didn't work out his relationship didn't work so we ended up single again,' Valeria said. In the early 1990s a health scare brought the pair back together.

Gyorgy had an operation and had nobody to look after him so Valeria took him in.

'I think I was looking after him too well as he stayed.' she said.

'Ever since then we have been living under the same roof but in separate bedrooms not like man and wife. It has worked very well.

'Living in a strange country we probably just needed each other.'

The pair moved to Plymouth six years ago to be closer to their daughter but say they didn't consider themselves a couple until two months ago when Gyorgy raised the subject of Valeria's original wedding ring.

'He asked me if I still had my ring from when we got married in 1964,' Valeria said.

'I said no. So he went out and got one and when he brought it home it fitted me.

'When I put the ring on I said, half-joking, half-serious, "Well now I've got the ring we'll have to get married again".

'He got very serious and we decided "Why not?"'

Valeria said she is delighted but stressed that they will stick with their existing living arrangements.'Nothing is going to change,' she said.

'We are going to get married we get a piece of paper and I get a new ring but at our age nothing changes. It's different when you're young.

'With us everything is carrying on as before. 1964 is 49 years ago. We have got a lot of history behind us.'

Gyorgy said: 'I was always really in love with her, I could not love any other woman but her.

'I thought if we got married it would be a miracle. Now the miracle has happened.'The couple are now planning to write a book about their life.
