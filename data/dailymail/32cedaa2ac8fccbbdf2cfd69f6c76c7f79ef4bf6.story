The Night Stalker killer who terrorized California in the mid-1980s, idolized the actor who played a mass murderer who kidnaps and skins women.

In his final interview, Ramirez spoke of his admiration for Ted Levine's performance as a psychopathic murderer who kidnaps and skins women in the 1991 thriller Silence of the Lambs.

Speaking from San Quentin Prison shortly before his death last month, the serial killer described his favourite scene from the classic scary movie.

Horror: Serial killer Richard Ramirez, who died last month, was a big fan of the main antagonist in Silence of the Lambs

That guy on the show “Monk”, I really liked him in “Silence of the Lambs”,’  Richard Ramirez  told the New York Post.

‘That scene where he says, “It rubs the lotion on its skin,” I really like [it]’

The scene refers to when Levine’s 
character Buffalo Bill demands his kidnapped victim to moisturize in 
order to make it easier for him to flay her.

Actor Ted Levine reacted with repulsion when told of his late admirer.

‘F*** him. I hope he’s in hell. That’s all I have to say about Richard Ramirez,’ he told The New York Post.

The newspaper exchanged several 
letters with Ramirez in his last years on death row, revealing his 
obsession with Asian women and reluctance to show remorse.

Addict: According to the coroner's report, Ramirez had serious conditions that indicated chronic drug use that predated his imprisonment, including hepatitis C

In a letter written in 2012 the 
serial killer writes of his life behind bars, saying he spends his days 
watching television, and in particular sporting events featuring female 
athletes.

He writes that he likes beach 
volleyball, girls gymnastics and wrestling, complaining that girls ‘used
to wear more revealing clothes.

He also asks for the reporter to send a ‘soft core picture book of Asian girls in bikini[s] or/and clothing items.’

Ramirez had been on death row at San Quentin State Prison since he was convicted in 1989 of 13 murders in 1984 and 1985.

He also was convicted of rape, sodomy, oral copulation, burglary and 
attempted murder. Executions have been on hold for years, however, 
because of ongoing legal challenges.

Ramirez was a self-proclaimed Satanist whose trial produced gruesome details about his mutilation of his victims.

He was nicknamed the Night Stalker by the media because residents were warned to lock their doors and windows as the killings peaked during the hot summer of 1985.

The killer had been entering homes through unlocked windows and doors. He then killed his victims with a gun or knife, burglarized the homes and sexually assaulted his female victims.

Richard Ramirez died June 7 at age 53 at a hospital where he had been taken for treatment of liver failure.

Prison guards have told how the notorious murderer turned bright green from liver failure in the hours before he died.

He died of complications from B-cell lymphoma, a cancer of the lymphatic system, according to the Marin County coroner's office.
