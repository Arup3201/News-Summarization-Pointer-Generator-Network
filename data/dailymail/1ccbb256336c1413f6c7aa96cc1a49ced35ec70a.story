Retired Cuban leader Fidel Castro released a statement, dated this week, saying that he doesn't trust U.S. policy, but that he doesn't reject peaceful solutions to conflicts

Retired Cuban leader Fidel Castro on Monday appeared to lend his support to talks with the U.S. in his first comments about his longtime adversary since both countries agreed last month to restore diplomatic ties.

But Castro, 88, stopped short of an enthusiastic endorsement of the rapprochement, announced on December 17 by his younger brother and Cuba's current president, Raul Castro, and President Obama.

'I don't trust the policy of the United States nor have I had an exchange with them, but this does not mean ... a rejection of a peaceful solution to conflicts or the dangers of war,' Fidel Castro said in a statement published on the website of Cuba's Communist Party newspaper, Granma.

The U.S. and Cuba held historic high-level talks last week in Havana that are expected to lead to the re-establishment of diplomatic ties severed by Washington in 1961.

'Any peaceful or negotiated solution to the problems between the United States and the peoples or any people of Latin America that doesn't imply force or the use of force should be treated in accordance with international norms and principles,' Fidel Castro said.

'We will always defend cooperation and friendship with all the peoples of the world, among them our political adversaries.'

He took power in a 1959 revolution and spent much of his 49 years in power railing against the United States, which never succeeded in many attempts to oust him.

He was finally forced into retirement in 2008 by poor health and was succeeded by his brother Raul, who is now 83.

'The president of Cuba has taken the pertinent steps in accordance with his prerogatives and the powers given to him by the National Assembly the Communist Party of Cuba,' Fidel Castro said of his brother in the statement.

His silence on the issue had led to speculation over his health and whether he supported his brother's rapprochement with the United States.

Two weeks ago, Fidel Castro sent a letter to soccer legend Diego Maradona to quash rumors of his death. At the time, it was the first reported word from Castro in nearly three months. The letter was read on Venezuela state television network Telesur.

A serious illness forced Castro to step down from duties as president in 2006, handing over leadership to his younger brother Raul.

The speculation about Fidel Castro's health had been prompted in part by his failure to comment after the U.S. and Cuba declared on December 17 that they would move to restore full diplomatic relations broken a half century ago.

The latest statement from Fidel was dated January 26.
