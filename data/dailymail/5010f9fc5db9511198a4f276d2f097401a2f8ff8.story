Lieutenant-Governor Najeeb Jung has recommended President's Rule in Delhi

It's going to be President's Rule for Delhi, with Lieutenant-Governor Najeeb Jung in charge. Top sources in the L-G's office have told Mail Today that President Pranab Mukherjee has been advised that no party is in a position to form the government in the state.

"A file has been sent to the Rashtrapati Bhavan recommending President's Rule," the source told Mail Today.

The move came very shortly after Aam Aadmi Party's Arvind Kejriwal met Jung and asked for 10 more days to clear the fog hanging over government formation and set an 18-point charter of demands for the Congress and BJP to accept their support.

But it seems that the academic-turned-administrator is in no mood to waste the electorate's time and energy any further and wants to set the administrative process rolling, which has been in cold storage since the code of conduct came into force ahead of the Delhi elections.

A top official told Mail Today: "The L-G has recommended the President's rule, but with a difference. The city under the recommended President's rule administered by the Delhi L-G will go back to pre-1993 days when there was no Assembly and it did not have advisors for the then-L-G.

"The current L-G is of the firm view that Delhi is a small state which can be managed without such advice, bearing an indirect load on the state exchequer."

This really means that the Jung will be effectively administering the state till there are fresh polls, which could be with the general elections next year.

The L-G appears to be responding to the need for urgency being expressed in the Capital to get a government going, with questions being raised about the intentions of political parties.

With the results of assembly polls a week old now, the political situation of the Capital continues to be uncertain, with neither BJP nor AAP consenting to form the government.

Silence

The BJP has been maintaining a constant silence under the guise of a "fractured mandate" and has kept itself aloof of the political churning.

The AAP, meanwhile, has been keeping Delhiites guessing with its own set of demands for both BJP and Congress.

AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal had quite a lucrative offer - complete unconditional support to form the Government in Delhi from the vanquished Congress.

Even on Saturday, after meeting Jung, Kejriwal has taken a conditional stand to form the Government and has put the onus on the Congress and BJP, asking for 10 more days.

But nothing concrete is expected, says a top government source, particularly after Congress MLAs pointed fingers at AAP for "shirking the moral responsibility to respect the Delhi mandate".

The AAP chief has also written to both Sonia Gandhi and Rajnath Singh asking their stand on 18 demands for developmental work in Delhi that the AAP intends to see through, if they want to be part of the government in Delhi.

Many within the Congress and BJP have rubbished the 18 demands as "delaying tactics". The move is also being seen as an attempt to put the government ball into the hands of the larger parties.

Congress general secretary Shakeel Ahmad on Saturday said the Congress will take a few days to reply to the Aam Aadmi Party's (AAP) letter setting conditions for forming the government in Delhi.

"We will examine the letter and will get back to Arvind Kejriwal in a day or two," Ahmad said soon after Congress president Sonia Gandhi forwarded him the letter by Kejriwal.

Ahmad had earlier written to Kejriwal about the readiness of the Congress to support an AAP government from outside.

However, the Congress's Delhi MLAs hit out at the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) over its reluctance on forming the government in Delhi.

They accused the AAP of shirking off responsibility. In a direct attack against Kejriwal, Congress MLA Haroon Yusuf slammed the party's 18-point questionnaire to Sonia Gandhi, saying that that by doing so, Kejriwal and his party members were ridiculing the democracy.

"We had expressed before the L-G, our willingness to support the AAP from outside just to ensure that the public mandate is respected.

"However, this act by the AAP whereby they wrote to the Congress, imposing conditions on executive matters, is unreasonable. Today they have written to the Congress, will they write to the United Nations or American President Barack Obama next?" Yusuf asked.

Reacting on the issue, another Congress MLA Arvinder Singh Lovely said: "These conditions deal with issues that are a state government's prerogative. So if the AAP comes to power, they must bring about these changes. Why do they then need to impose them upon us? Did they ask us before making these promises?".

Delhi BJP chief Vijay Goel has accused the AAP of playing 'dirty politics'

The BJP'S Delhi unit, which is upset with the AAP's 18-point agenda, has charged that the latter's leader Arvind Kejriwal is playing "dirty politics to hog the media attention".

Delhi BJP chief Vijay Goel said: "The AAP is simply trying to be in the limelight and divert the attention of Delhiites with silly acts. What does it mean by the 18-point letter sent to us? If the AAP forms the government, it can regulate and implement whatever the party plans to do in Delhi".

Goel alleged that the AAP's 18-point agenda is a ploy to distract the attention of voters from the fact that the party is shirking its responsibility though it is in a position to form a government.

"The AAP doesn't want the people to realise that it will be held responsible for the inconvenience caused to them if Delhi goes to re-polls," he said.

Several BJP workers wondered why the AAP convener had sought 10 days' time from Lieutenant Governor Najeeb Jung.

"If the party is firm that it will not form the government, why does it need 10 days' time to come to a conclusion? What are AAP workers aspiring to achieve?" a senior Delhi BJP leader asked on condition of anonymity.

BJP leaders also criticised the AAP for being fickle-minded.

"The party had made it clear that it would not take support from anyone. Then Prashant Bhushan made a statement saying if the AAP could lend support to the BJP in Delhi if its demands were met.

"After that Kejriwal said under no circumstances the AAP would be associated with corrupt parties such as the BJP and the Congress. Now, he is again back with his dirty games," Goel added.
