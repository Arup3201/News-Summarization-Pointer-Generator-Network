Private care: Minister Elizabeth Truss prefers to use a nanny to care for her children

The minister behind controversial plans to expand nursery and childminder places by cutting requirements for staff numbers has admitted she uses a nanny.

Liz Truss, the Education Minister, wants to relax current rules which currently limit the number of children a childminder can look after to four.

The plans have come under fire from some childcare experts who say they could dilute the quality of care for youngsters.

But Miss Truss, who has two daughters,
will not be affected by the planned shake-up because she has hired a 
nanny, who she said was ‘expensive’ but ‘an absolute lifesaver’.

Yesterday
she explained that she had found it ‘impossible’ to get a full daycare 
place in London for her two daughters.

Many mothers returning to work 
would prefer to leave under-twos with a nanny but the costs, up to 
£30,000 a year, are too high.

Yet
coalition plans to make childcare more affordable ignore the option of 
nannies, focusing solely on nurseries and childminders.

In addition, Miss Truss’s proposals 
include relaxing the nursery worker to child ratio so that each staff 
member can care for up to six two-year-olds.

The argument is that childcare costs would come down and nurseries would be able to hire fewer but better qualified staff.

Miss Truss, whose daughters are four 
and six, said: ‘I feel I’m fortunate compared with a lot of parents in 
being able to afford a nanny but, you know, it’s expensive,’ she said.

‘When we’ve looked into trying to find a full daycare place in London it’s just been impossible. You just cannot get one.’

However,
across England, the number of nursery places has almost doubled in the 
last decade, according to figures from the Family and Parenting 
Institute and Daycare Trust.

The number of full-time nursery places in England has grown from 431,600 in 2003 to 721,500 in 2011.

New rules: The new limits suggested by Miss Truss would see the allowed number of children per member of staff in nurseries or childminders increase from four to six

Miss
Truss also revealed she had to resort to bringing her children to work 
once during a childcare crisis: ‘We had meetings throughout the day and 
the girls had to play outside the office while mummy went to ‘boring’ 
meetings.

‘All of a sudden 
one of my daughters bounded into the meeting because she decided she 
wanted to say hello, to the shock and surprise of the officials.

'She sat herself on my knee and wriggled whilst we talked. The topic of the meeting - childcare!’

Squeezed families deserved the same service for their children as she gets from her nanny, she said.

Miss Truss wants childminders to have better qualifications and training and she wants agencies to cover holidays and sick days. She also wants to make the service more flexible, to make it home based and flexible for people who work irregular hours

Like many working parents, Miss Truss said she was guilty of ‘merging’ home and work life and constantly checking her Blackberry even when she was taking her children to the park.

‘I’m a BlackBerry person. My office get all these random messages at 11 at night because I find that when the children have gone to bed that’s a good time to get things done,’ she said.

‘It’s a merger of home life and work life. They aren’t that separate, I must confess, and my daughters know an awful lot about childcare reform now because of it.’

The Minister has been challenged by childminders and commentators to try looking after four children at once after her announcement on relaxing regulations for staff.

In a riposte to her opponents, she said: ‘I’m a parent, not a trained professional. I don’t think being an early-years educator is something anybody can just walk into. It [the criticism] does betray an attitude that some people have that it shouldn’t be a professional career.’

Working women in Britain were getting a raw deal because everything had to be ‘juggled’, she said, but in France childcare was ‘a completely normal part of everyday life. Here we always talk about juggling, like it’s all a bit of a balancing act.’
