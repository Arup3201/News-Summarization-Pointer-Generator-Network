The workplace may look drastically different in 25 years with hologram colleagues and coffee delivering drones on the cards, according to a new futuristic report.

Accounting software firm MYOB has released the Future of Business in Australia 2040 report, which suggests technology changes in the workplace will be driven by rising energy costs and transport, as well as environmental impact.

MYOB Chief Technology Officer Simon Raik-Allen says the biggest invention to change the workforce since email will be the holographic representation of people.

'We will work in a 'shared workplace' that will be set up so that you can interact with holographic people from all around the world,' Raik-Allen said. 

'You may never meet the people you work for in person, because you will be pitching your ideas to a global workforce.' 

The report suggests that while we may be able to wear our technology now, the year 2040 will herald thought activation and mind control. 

'You will be able to have chips embedded in your body, that interface with various parts of your body to either report on your health so you can manage your food and vitamin intake, or send signals to various organs to help regulate your body,' he said.

'Extremely tiny robots known as nanobots will crawl through your veins performing maintenance.'

'Your brain will be also start to be integrated and there will be many things you can control just by thinking about them. You might even be able to purchase brain add-ons, just like you buy apps today for your phone.'

A suburban village with everyone living and working primarily within walking distance of their homes will also be a focus in 2040, according to the report.

'You'll be able to trade with your neighbours, list your skills on local noticeboards, and find local experts to fix anything from your 3D printer to an ailing solar panel,' Mr Raik-Allen said.

Autonomous vehicles such as drones and self-driving cars will deliver packages between communities or even a coffee and a bagel to your current location in a suburban village form of living

'Autonomous vehicles such as drones and self-driving cars will deliver packages between communities or even a coffee and a bagel to your current location.'

'Much of the suburban park land will become communal farming land to provide vegetables and fruit to the local community without the need for delivery trucks.'

The report was published by MYOB to stimulate discussion and planning in the workplace to encourage people to start thinking about the future, according to Mr Raik-Allen.
