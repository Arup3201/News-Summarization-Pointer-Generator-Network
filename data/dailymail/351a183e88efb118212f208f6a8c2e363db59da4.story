John Carmody and his dog Bruiser which the Royal Mail claim was spotted loose on the street. He claims his dog is always kept in a fenced off garden

A group of residents will go without Christmas deliveries this week after the mail service to their street was suspended because of a dog attack that occurred 17 months ago.

Royal Mail has said residents of Copley Avenue, Meltham, must go to their nearest post office to collect their mail after it was claimed the dog responsible for the attack in 2013 was seen loose in the street.

It is the second time deliveries to Copley Avenue have been suspended after postman Jason Lee was attacked.

It closely resembles the situation of Chestnut Grove, in Sandiacre, Nottinghamshire, where mail deliveries have only just been restarted after a five-month suspension.

Residents in the street were left fuming after having to trek to the nearest post office to collect their mail. 

John Carmody, 32, the owner of the dog in question on Copley Avenue, hit back at the suggestion made about his dog while labelling the actions of Royal Mail as 'ludicrous'.

'I have had my dog for over 10 years and he has never attacked anyone,' said Mr Carmody, whose dog, Bruiser, is an Irish Staffordshire cross bullmastiff.

'The incident was a one off and was probably preventable had the postman not pushed his post bag in his face. He has barked at the postman all his life, like many dogs do, but he has never even growled at people let alone attacked anyone before.

'It had been a warm summer day and we had all the doors and windows open when the postman came. I was told by the postmaster that he had only spoken to his staff to be more vigilant around houses with dogs that same day and to not enter if the door is open.'

Despite the one-off incident, Royal Mail has again suspended its deliveries after it was claimed Mr Carmody's dog was seen roaming in the street.

Mr Carmody said: 'He is never allowed to roam the streets and is always in a fenced-off garden. I am baffled by their decision. Why do it so close to Christmas? It happened well over a year ago and he is really not a nasty dog.

Mr Carmody added: 'He has been brought up with young children around him and has never bothered anyone. Royal Mail should have contacted me about this but I have not heard anything from them.' 

Mr Lee, however, was forced to undergo plastic surgery after suffering an injury to his arm following the attack on Copley Avenue.

But as the dog and Mr Lee were on private property, no charges were ever brought against the animal's owner.

As well as the stoppage in deliveries, residents are infuriated about having not been told about the decision by Royal Mail and only found out from an article in the local newspaper.

Carol Morris, 52, a resident on the street for 34 years, said: 'I have been wondering where my post is. I had no idea deliveries had been stopped but it makes sense now. I have been awaiting important bills to pay. I just don't understand why they have decided to do this.

'John's dog is really nice and friendly. To be honest, we don't even see him a lot as he is not often out. I was shocked by what happened last year and I could not believe it was John's dog that was involved. It was just one unfortunate incident.'

A Royal Mail spokesperson said: 'We have temporarily suspended deliveries to a number of addresses in Copley Avenue, Meltham, due to the threat of a dangerous dog being kept at a property being loose on the road.

'This dog has previously attacked a postman, leaving him with serious injuries, and is not currently being kept securely at the address.

'We have asked the dog owner to take the necessary steps to ensure the dog is kept securely within grounds of the property and is not able to roam free. We want to restore services to customers as soon as possible and will do so when as soon as this is addressed.'

Mr Lee, 42, was left with a four inch gaping wound on his right arm and requiring stitches in his buttock after the dog pinned him to the ground and started 'tearing chunks' out of him while he carried out his daily round.

After undergoing plastic surgery to repair his arm injuries, Mr Lee had to take nine months off work to recover.

Mr Lee, of Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, a postie for 20 years, said: 'I knew about this dog and I'd been wary of it before because it looked dangerous and acted aggressively.

'I remember looking through into the living room where the dog's owner was and he was just lying on his sofa, relaxing.

'Then, as soon as I approached the door I saw this gigantic dog come around the corner and it just came flying towards my head.

'It wrestled with me and pinned me down on the floor and it was so big and strong that I couldn't move at all while it was tearing chunks out of me.

'I then felt the teeth sink into my buttock and I started shouting for help. It was the most painful thing that's ever happened to me.

'The owner then came out and startled the dog so I managed to run to safety.

'It all happened so quickly that I didn't even get a chance to think about what was happening.

'I just thought that this was the end and I wasn't going to survive.'
