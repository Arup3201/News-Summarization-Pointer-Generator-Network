Mosquito traps have been set up at motorway service stations because motorists returning from the Continent could be carrying home a deadly species.

The Asian tiger mosquito, which can bite 50 times in 15 minutes and carries the life-threatening dengue fever, yellow and Chikungunya fevers, hides in caravans, camping trailers and motorhomes. 

It has been spreading north from southern Europe and experts believe it could soon establish in the UK.

The traps have been installed on the main routes from the Channel ferry ports and the Eurotunnel terminal.

They resemble black plant pots and contain water to attract the insects. A few 
leaves are inserted and a small polystyrene square placed on top of the 
water.

The dark, wet spaces are ideal shelters for mosquitoes to lay 
their eggs. The sticky larvae then attaches to the polystyrene.

Scientists
 check the traps every two weeks. If larvae are seen, the polystyrene is
 removed and bagged, and a replacement inserted. Samples are then tested
 in the laboratory to identify the insect species.

Jolyon Medlock, head of medical entomology at Public Health England, said: 'Asian tiger mosquitoes have now spread along motorways from Greece, 
Spain and Italy through the south of France as far as Lyon.

'But with 
many holidaymakers driving to the south of France, Italy and Spain the 
potential is there for the mosquito to enter the country.

'If a mosquito 
flies into a car you’ll swat them, but people are unlikely to know if a 
mosquito is sheltering inside a caravan or trailer.

'So we’ve decided to 
set up traps away from the  coast where mosquitoes may escape from 
vehicles into the environment.'

Shipments to Britain of used tyres where the mosquito likes to nest are also routinely inspected.

Asian tiger mosquitoes, named after their distinctive striped markings, thrive in temperate climate and can carry more than 20 exotic diseases.

Dr Medlock said the intensive mosquito surveillance was necessary so health chiefs could plan for possible disease outbreaks and warn people about the potential threat.

Surveillance is also being extended in a triangle from Basildon in Essex to Canterbury and Dartford in Kent to monitor the spread of another dangerous mosquito, known as Culex modestus, which can transmit West Nile Virus which can be fatal to humans.

Until four years, ago this mosquito was thought to be extinct in the UK, but it was found in a trap in marshes at Cliffe north, Kent, and has extended to Faversham. Mosquitoes trapped and tested have so far been free of the virus.

July is the peak time for mosquitoes in Britain, but householders can reduce numbers in their garden by emptying paddling pools, covering water butts and turning buckets, plant pots or other containers upside down to prevent collecting water which attracts the insects.
