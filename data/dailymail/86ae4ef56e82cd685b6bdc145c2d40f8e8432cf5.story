Jeep is recalling more than 228,000 SUVs worldwide to fix a software problem that can cause side air bags to inflate for no reason.

The recall covers Jeep Cherokees from the 2014 and 2015 model years.

Fiat Chrysler, which makes Jeeps, says there have been a small number of inadvertent air bag deployments.

Canadian safety regulators say the problem occurred mainly in off-road situations. 

Sudden air bag inflation can startle drivers and cause crashes, but Chrysler says it's not aware of any accidents or injuries.

Most of the recalled vehicles are in the U.S. and Canada. Dealers will recalibrate the software to change the threshold for inflating the air bags.

The problem is the latest in a string of auto industry troubles with air bags.

The 2014 model of Jeep Cherokee is priced from $20,000 and over a million Jeeps were sold worldwide last year - a 39% increase from 2013.

Jeep are reacting to worldwide demand by planning more availability of the brand in China and Brazil. 

President and CEO of the brand, Mike Manley, told the Detroit Free Press: 'There is definitely pent-up demand around the world for Jeeps, but they just haven't been available.

'I think we are just seeing the start of Jeep gaining real traction.
