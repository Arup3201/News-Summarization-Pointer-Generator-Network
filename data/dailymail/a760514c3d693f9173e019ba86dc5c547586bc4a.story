A huge population of wild monkeys is sweeping across Florida after being introduced during the filming of TARZAN.

There are now thought to be 1,000 Rhesus monkeys roaming the sunshine state - all descended from three males and females released together in the late 1930s.

The 'couples' were brought to America and marooned on a small island near the Silver River by tour operator Colonel Tooey.

The six original monkeys were marooned on an island near Silver River as a tourist attraction during the filming of Tarzan Finds a Son

The entrepreneur who owned the monkeys didn't realise they could swim and so they escaped

Some tour guides say he wanted to capitalise on the success of the 1939 hit Tarzan Finds A Son, which filmed nearby, to promote his jungle tours.

However the bungling businessman didn't realise the species could swim and they quickly escaped from 'Monkey Island' and started breeding.

Nearly 80 years later some have been seen as far away as Jacksonville and Sarasota - more than 100 miles from Silver River State Park, near Ocala.

Eighty years after they were accidentally introduced the monkeys have been seen up to 100 miles away from Silver River

Despite their numbers the monkeys have had no obvious impact on the ecosystem

Florida State's policy is usually to eliminate any feral species - as seen with the well publicised hunt for Burmese pythons in the Everglades.

But, in an ironic twist to Colonel Tooey's original plan, the monkeys are now attracting tourists across the state.

Local tour operator Captain Tom O'Lenick, 65, said: 'Everybody who comes on the river for a tour wants to see the monkeys.

The monkeys prey on insects and are particularly fond of long-jawed orb-weaver spiders

The macaques have also become prey for foxes, owls, bobcats and alligators which leap out of rivers to grab them

'From my point of view, as a naturalist, I think the planet changes naturally and species do move around, whether that is by man or other means.

'Change is the way the planet works - so I would just keep them.'

He said the monkeys do not seem to have an obvious impact on the ecosystem and have even become prey for foxes, owls, bobcats and alligators - which leap from the river to snatch them out of trees.

Johnny Weissmuller and Maureen O'Sullivan starred as Tarzan and Jane in the 1939 film Tarzan Finds a Son which was filmed in Florida

British wildlife photographer Graham McGeorge, 42, is among those who have travelled to Silver Springs to see the monkeys.

He said: 'Some of the macaques are braver than others, usually the males. Nursing females and babies tend to keep further away.

'The balance of their diet is made up of dirt, insects, and they love spiders. Long-jawed orb-weaver spiders are common along the banks of the river, and the monkeys eat them like candy.'

He added: 'They are not a pest to people - people are pest to the macaques. People feed them and this is not cool. You should never feed wildlife.

'Just like any other wild animal you need to give them space.'

State officials have caught more than
 700 of the monkeys over the last 10 years and found that most tested 
positive for the herpes-B virus.

It
 is because of this disease, which is often lethal to humans but rarely 
contracted, that some consider the monkeys a public health hazard.

However,
 there was controversy in 2012 when the Tampa Bay Times reported 
suspicions that the state catcher had sold captured monkeys on to 
research laboratories.
