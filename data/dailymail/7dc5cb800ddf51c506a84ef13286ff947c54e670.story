A choirmaster who claimed to stand up for 'Christian values and ethics' has been jailed for sexually abusing a six-year-old girl.

David Mason, 71, from Riverside, Brighton-Le-Sands, near Crosby, pleaded guilty to three charges of indecent assault on his victim when she was between the ages of six and nine in the early nineties.

The father of two, who was jailed for ten years, said he stood up for 'Christian values and ethics' but a judge who heard his trial told him those claims were hollow and he was a man of 'warped values'. 

Mason denied other allegations including indecency with a child and attempted rape, forcing his victim to relive years of abuse by giving evidence before a jury during which he branded her 'a fantasist' with a tendency to exaggerate.

Liverpool Crown Court heard that Mason encouraged the young girl to engage in various  sex acts.

During his trial he made claims which the judge branded 'extraordinary nonsense', saying that the abuse was 'light-hearted, it wasn't horrible'.

'There was no evil intent, no nasty hurting intent, it was a natural thing.'

He said the girl would sit 'coquettishly' and showed a lot of leg and that she would take her clothes off and run around 'teasing' him and even claimed she had 'hoaxed' him into being alone with her, leading to 'rough and tumble'.

Mason said she was 'exploring her sexuality with him'.

Judge Andrew Hatton, said: 'She was an eight-year-old girl. You were suggesting that an eight-year-old girl was flirting with you.'

Speaking of the attempted rape he said Mason's words to her had lived with her all her life and continued to chill her.

Mason, who was of previous good character, was found guilty of three counts of indecency with a child, two of indecent assault and one of attempted rape.

He was found not guilty of one count of indecency with a child.

He was jailed for 10 years and put on the sex offenders register for the rest of life.

Detective Sergeant Paul Donaghy said: 'His victim has shown an immense amount of bravery in coming forward and having to re-live the abuse she suffered at Mason's hands.

'I hope his sentencing gives her some sense of closure and also provides wider reassurance that a dangerous and determined sex offender is now behind bars.

'I would like to reassure anyone who has been a victim of sexual abuse that any complaint will be taken extremely seriously and investigated by specially-trained officers who will offer support every step of the way.'
