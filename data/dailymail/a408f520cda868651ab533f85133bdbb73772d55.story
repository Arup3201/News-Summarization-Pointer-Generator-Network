Fresh from their draw against table-topping Chelsea on Sunday, Manchester City's stars have the chance to recreate their fairytale comeback - as they got their hands on EA Sports' newest football game ahead of public release.

Edin Dzeko, who led the line at the Etihad on the weekend until Pablo Zabaleta's red card, was one of a host of city stars seen leaving their ground with the new game.

Eliaquim Mangala, who enjoyed a superb debut against Chelsea at centre half, was another leaving the Etihad with the priority copies, as did full backs Bacary Sagna and Aleksandar Kolarov.

However, manager Manuel Pelegrini seems to have had enough of 'Team management' and decided that he'll focus on his real life players over their virtual counterparts.

FIFA 15, which features Lionel Messi and Chelsea's Eden Hazard on its front cover, is released to the public on Friday.
