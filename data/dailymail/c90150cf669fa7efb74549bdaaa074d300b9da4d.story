As confetti rained on the Superdome last night, Baltimore Ravens quarterback Joe Flacco dropped an F-bomb as he celebrated with teammates following their incredible Super Bowl win.

The two-second delay did not appear to be working after the clock ran out in the fourth quarter, and live mics and cameras were rushed to the field to capture the festivities.

But with that came some material that was unintended for the more than 100 million people who tuned in to the national Super Bowl telecast on CBS.

It was a tender moment as Flacco was embraced by guard Marshal Yanda, who yelled to the Super Bowl MVP: 'Holy s***, huh?'

Flacco emphatically responded: 'F***ing Awesome!'

The verbal vulgarity may grab the attention of the Federal Communications Commission, which has had trouble with Super Bowl broadcasts in the past.

The FCC would not comment on the Flacco situation when reached by MailOnline today.

Last year, the NFL apologized after singer M.I.A. gave cameras the middle finger during Madonna's halftime show.

But none would be as notorious as Janet Jackson's 'wardrobe malfunction' during the big game in 2004. An FCC fine against CBS was later thrown out in court nearly eight years later.

Capping a perfect postseason, the 
unassuming and unheralded Flacco completed 22 of 33 passes for 287 yards
and three first-half touchdowns, earning Super Bowl MVP honors.

In post-game interviews, Flacco set aside any questions about just how good he is and whether he belongs in the conversation about the league's best quarterbacks, becoming only the sixth in 47 Super Bowls to throw for three scores in a first half.

'Now they're gonna have to talk about Joe Flacco,' center Matt Birk said. 'Joe's a stud. He showed it tonight.'

The admittedly mild-mannered guy, who played his college football far from the spotlight at Delaware, wrapped up Baltimore's four-game run to the title with a record-equaling 11 touchdown passes and zero interceptions, going 73 of 126 for 1,140 yards.

But Flacco's job in the second half Sunday was more about being safe than spectacular.

He had helped Baltimore take a 21-6 
halftime lead, and it grew to 28-6 when Jones returned the second-half 
kickoff a Super Bowl-record 108 yards.

That's when things got strange.

First, the lights inside the Superdome cut out, delaying action for more than a half-hour.

And when play resumed, San Francisco quickly scored 17 consecutive points to make things interesting.

The Ravens held on down the stretch. 
Two short field goals by rookie Justin Tucker padded the lead, and the 
Ray Lewis-led defense stopped the 49ers on a fourth-and-goal at the 5 
with under 2 minutes left.

'I was sitting there thinking, "There's no way. There's no way we stop them here,"' Flacco said. 'But we did.'

Neither Flacco nor his team appeared to be ready to take on all comers as the regular season concluded.

After all, the Ravens lost four of their final five games to stumble into the playoffs.

And Flacco, a fifth-year pro, 
finished only 12th in the 32-team NFL in passer rating at a merely 
passable 87.7 - way behind league leader Aaron Rodgers' 108.0 - while 
compiling 22 touchdown passes and 10 interceptions.

Middle-of-the-pack, to say the least.

But he and his team definitely did shine when the results mattered most.

'I tell you what: We don't make it easy,' said Flacco, who set an NFL quarterback record by leading his team to playoff wins in each of his first five seasons.

He is 9-4 overall in the postseason, but was 0-2 in AFC championship games until this year.

And now his contract is up. He could wind up with one of the most lucrative deals in NFL history, perhaps commanding somewhere in the neighborhood of $20million a year.
