John Carver will remain in caretaker charge of Newcastle until the end of the season – and could yet land the role on a permanent basis.

The 50-year-old has been told by managing director Lee Charnley to take control of United’s final 16 matches of the Premier League campaign.

Charnley and chief scout Graham Carr – the men tasked with finding the new head coach by owner Mike Ashley – will now wait until the summer before making a permanent appointment.

Carver was on Newcastle's books as a youngster in the early 1980s but never made the breakthrough

That could yet be Carver should he impress between now and May 24, although he is still searching for his first win since taking over from Alan Pardew at the beginning of January.

Derby’s Steve McClaren had been the club’s preferred choice to replace Pardew, but he wants to see out the season with the Rams as they bid for promotion to the Premier League.

Following the announcement that Carver would be staying at the helm, Charnley said: 'At the beginning of this process it was my desire and intention to appoint an individual to the position of head coach who would be available to start immediately.

'Having now explored at some length the options available to us at this time, the decision has been taken to defer the appointment of a permanent head coach until the end of the season.

'The head coach will be a long-term appointment that will play a major role in shaping the future on-field progression of Newcastle United and it is vitally important that we get the right individual. 

Alan Pardew, left Newcastle earlier in January, and has made an immediate impact at Crystal Palace 

Ajax manager Frank De Boer is among the contenders to be appointed the next Newcastle manager 

Steve McClaren is Newcastle's No 1 target 

'John has a long history with the club and has the full support of the board. Our goal for the season of a minimum top ten finish remains unchanged and we are confident that John, supported by the backroom staff, will be able to deliver this.' 

Carver added: 'This is a proud day for me.

'I have worked with, and learnt from, the best manager that this football club has had in Sir Bobby Robson. I know what this club means to this city and its people. I believe in my players and the staff I have around me.

"I am confident that we can deliver exciting successful football and look forward with relish to my role as head coach of this great football club.'

Other candidates include Ajax boss Frank De Boer and Christophe Galtier at St Etienne, although Sportsmail understands McClaren is their No.1 pick.

The former England manager has a close relationship with Carr and has connections with the club’s hierarchy.

His availability could depend on the success – or otherwise – of Derby’s promotion chase.

Carver, meanwhile, would have to enjoy a winning end to season to enhance his chances of managing his hometown club on a full-time basis.
