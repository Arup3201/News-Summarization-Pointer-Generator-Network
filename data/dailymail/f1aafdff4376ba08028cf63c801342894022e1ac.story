A school in Norfolk has banned students from wearing skirts in an attempt to crack down on 'immodest' clothing styles, after giving up on the struggle to stop girls from shortening their skirts.

From September, both boys and girls at Diss High School will have to wear trousers. following a school ruling.

The decision has been described as 'ridiculous' and 'poorly thought out' by parents, residents and local council officials.

Diss High School has been caught up in controversy following their ruling that later this year they will be banning students from wearing skirts in their school

Diss High School, Norfolk. The school  has taken the decision to ban female pupils from wearing skirts, they will only be allowed to wear trousers

In addition to banning all skirts, the 
governors also backed the school's decision to ban make-up for pupils in
 years 7-11; which consists of children aged 10 to 16.

The decision to ban skirts was floated by a group of governors, pupils and staff, who met last year as part of a focus group on school uniform.

Head teacher Dr Jan Hunt, who claims that the tendency for some girls to shorten their skirts has led to the ban

Headteacher Jan Hunt said: 'Girls already wear trousers at Diss High School.

'The reason the school is making this compulsory is the tendency for some girls to wear really short skirts.

'Hemlines have risen to a level that is both impractical as well as immodest.

'Inevitably, this decision is popular with some parents and not with others.'

Dr Hunt said: 'The same responses would be true for pupils.

'Financial support will be offered to parents to support this transition.'

A Norfolk County Council spokesman said: 'In terms of uniform policy that is not something we administer, it is purely down to the school to make that decision.'

Councillor Florence Ellis, a former teacher, spoke out against the ban.

She said: ‘I think that setting rules
 and regulations is good for parents and students, adhering to them is 
preparation for life.

'We lost shirts and ties to polo shirts and sweatshirts thus lowering standards.

'They should be maintaining the rules 
that have been successful in the past, like monitoring skirt lengths, 
rather than an overall ban.

Councillor Florence Ellis originally spoke out on twitter, raising questions and pointing out problems with the practicality of the ban

'By not conforming to rules and 
regulations in something like the length of a skirt can lead at a later 
date to disregard for rules/law and order and may encourage anti social 
behaviour.

‘What if there are parents or students who are against wearing trousers for religious reasons?

'What
 happens when it gets to summer and girls no longer want to wear 
trousers in the heat? Are they going to have to wear shorts? 

‘I wonder has the school really thought this through.’

Local parents and residents have also spoken out against the prospective ban.

Amber Ervine, 26, said: 'I don’t know
 if I agree with it. I see teenage girls walking round with tiny skirts 
but I don’t know if you can ban them from wearing them.'

Jane Brown said: 'I think they should be able to wear skirts so long as they are not really short.

'I would restrict the length of them so they looked respectable.'

Teresa Mayston, 56, said: 'It is ridiculous.

I think it is silly to ban them at school because it is free choice, isn’t it?

'As long as the skirt is of a certain length then I think they should be able to wear skirts.

'But unfortunately I think the rules are not being adhered to and some of the skirts are not skirts.'

Alison Moore, 49, said: 'It seems unfair to me.

'You are doing something that is penalising girls.'

The decision has sparked outrage from some parents and students, but others have agreed with the policy, branding the short skirts 'immodest'

Zoe Taylor, 44, said: 'I like girls to look like girls. I like the feminine side of wearing a skirt as part of a uniform.

'I used to have the trouser option, but I always chose the skirt because it is more feminine.

'Unfortunately,
 the way children wear uniforms nowadays is inappropriate. I am not sure
 how I would enforce having a certain length of skirt that had to be 
adhered to.'

The trend of short skirts has been 
popular for ages, with recent films like St Trinian's, and provocative 
advertising campaigns making the style even more popular in recent 
years.

The typical fabric 
used to make school skirts makes them very easy to adjust, with methods 
of adjustment ranging from simple sewing techniques to rolling up the 
skirts at the waist to make them shorter.
