Missing: Mami Konneh Lahun, who finished 20th in the London Marathon, disappeared after the race

Sierra Leone’s fastest long-distance runner has disappeared after completing the London Marathon.

Police said Mami Konneh Lahun, 24, vanished after crossing the finish line on Sunday in 21st place.

The alarm was raised when she failed to return to her accommodation in Greenwich, East London, ahead of her flight home on Monday.

It is thought the athlete may have fled to avoid returning to Sierra Leone.

It is not uncommon for athletes from developing nations to run away during international competitions or claim asylum.

During the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester, two-thirds of the Sierra Leone team disappeared.

Twenty-one people from the 30-strong team failed to catch their flight home.

At the London 2012 Olympics, 82 athletes, coaches and officials claimed political asylum.

Police admitted last year that they were still looking for 21 people who had vanished after the Games.

Miss Lahun, who was nominated for Sports Personality of the Year in Sierra Leone last year, has won marathons in her own country and neighbouring Liberia.

She was the first runner to represent the West African nation in the London Marathon, finishing the race in two hours and 46 minutes.

Inquiry: The athlete was last seen after crossing the finishing line in The Mall and failed to appear at her accommodation in Greenwich

Appealing for information yesterday 
morning, a spokesman said: ‘Mami has no known links to the UK and does 
not have a mobile phone.’

Last
 night, the Metropolitan Police mistakenly announced she had ‘been found
 safe and well’ in Greenwich, only to admit two hours later that she was
 still missing.

Her disappearance comes on the back of news that runner Robert Berry, 42, from Reading, collapsed and died following the race.

Some £11,000 has since been donated in his name to the National Osteoporosis Society.

Anyone with information about the whereabouts of  Mami Konneh Lahun asked to call 101, quoting reference 14MIS012462.
