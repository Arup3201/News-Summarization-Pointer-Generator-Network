By day, Dr. Stephen Kinzey was a respected, tenured professor, loved by his students and well thought of by his university colleagues. But by night, cops claim Kinzey lived a secret shadow life as the drug-dealing, gun-toting leader of an outlaw biker gang called the Devil's Diciples (sic).

When police raided the well-tended, Spanish-style home that Kinzey shared with his beautiful blonde girlfriend in an upscale California community, it looked like an episode of TV’s 'Breaking Bad', in which a school chemistry teacher gets sucked into a dangerous double life as a crystal meth dealer.

San Bernardino detectives seized more than a pound of methamphetamine, hand guns, rifles, a shotgun, brass knuckles, body armor, cash, leather gear with gang colors and Nazi SS insignias - plus a black jacket bearing the name 'Skinz', the name Kinzey goes by in the biker world.

Respectable: Stephen Kinzey, (left) who was professor of kinesiology at Cal State University in San Bernardino, California, was loved by his students and faculty colleagues. They are shocked at the claims against him. The claims have uncanny similarities with Bryan Cranston's character in Breaking Bad (right)

'Outlaw': Kinzey is alleged to be 'Skinz' the gung-toting, drug-dealing leader of the Devil's Diciples gang

That bust at the HQ of Kinzey's alleged drug empire - and his subsequent arrest - came three years ago almost to the day. 

When Kinzey was arrested on August 26 2011, it sent shock waves through the sprawling campus of Cal State University in San Bernardino, where, for more than a decade, Kinzey, 48, taught kinesiology, the science of human movement. 

And his arrest stunned the mild mannered professor's neighbors in the quiet, tree-lined section of nearby Highland where he lived with his girlfriend Holly Robinson, his alleged partner in a meth dealing operation that police say raked in big bucks. 

'I was shocked', said one neighbor who recalls Kinzey having occasional visits from friends on motor cycles, but no rowdy parties or trouble. 'He always seemed like a nice, friendly person.'

Kinzey's father, Hank Kinzey, 69, who lives near Detroit, described Stephen - who was fired from his Cal State teaching job in December 2012 - as a good Catholic and a good father who doesn't drink and doesn't smoke. 'I believe my son is innocent and this is all a huge mistake.'

But cops insist there is no mistake - that quiet, reserved Kinzey, who has a 17 year-old daughter from a failed marriage, is indeed a wolf in sheep's clothing, the allege. 

'One side of him was a successful and productive member of society, but the other side of him is an outlaw motorcycle gang leader,' San Bernardino County Sheriff's Sgt. Paul Wynn - a lead investigator in the case - told reporters after Kinzey’s arrest. 'He was the highest ranking person in the group, without a doubt.'

Wynn was part of a six-month investigation called Operation Devil's Professor' which was launched in 2011 when a separate probe of another biker gang - the Mongols - stumbled upon the name 'Skinz'.

That was the name of the president of the San Bernardino chapter of the Devil's Diciples and the alleged mastermind of a major methamphetamine trafficking ring.

Haul: Police raided Spanish-style home in San Bernardino he shared with blonde girlfriend and seized a pound of meth, rifles, brass knuckles as Nazi SS insignias

Dealer: Detectives, working with the FBI, tapped Kinzey's cellphone and, after months of undercover surveillance, they concluded he was buying crystal meth in one pound bricks and dividing it into ounce bags

When Skinz allegedly turned out to be Profesor Kinzey - who has bachelors, masters and doctorate degrees and chaired several academic committees at Cal State - even the cops found it hard to believe at first. 

'I have kids in college and to have a professor who is a member of the Devil's Diciples and allegedly dealing methamphetamine, is quite alarming - unusual, to say the least,' said then San Bernardino County Sheriff, Rod Hoops at the time.

Local detectives, working with the FBI, tapped Kinzey's cellphone and, after months of undercover surveillance, they concluded that he was buying crystal meth in one pound bricks and dividing it into ounce bags which mid-level dealers distributed to street dealers in the San Bernardino area, some 60 miles east of Los Angeles.

According to cops, Kinzey used code to communicate with drug dealers and a supplier. In one text he wrote…'bring whatever cabbage u got for my soup cuz ingredients are low'. 

In another text exchange, Kinzey allegedly questioned a drug source about the quality of his product by asking if he has 'grade-A high quality study materials'. The supplier replied: 'I might as well get a degree.'

The end result of the investigation was the August 26, 2011 raid on Kinzey’s home which netted the pound of meth, with a street value of $12,000, guns, Devil’s Diciples paraphernalia…..and the arrest of nine other members of Kinzey's alleged drug ring, including his live-in girlfriend, Holly Robinson. Kinzey wasn't home at the time of the raid but turned himself in later.

Kinzey's lawyer, James Glick has claimed that his client 'didn't have anything to do with' the drugs found during the raid on his home. 

And in one interview shortly after Kinzey’s arrest, Glick added: 'This is not a major drug case - it's just because of what he (Kinzey) does for a living (meaning his then job as a Cal. State professor)'.

Moll: Holly Robinson, an ex-Cal State student of Kinzey and his live-in girlfriend who calls his 'old lady', has pleaded not guilty to possession of drugs for sale while armed, possession of drugs for sale and conspiracy

Kinzey faces five felony counts: possessing drugs while armed, participating in a criminal street gang, possession of drugs for sale, conspiracy to sell drugs and receiving a stolen gun. Kinzey - who is pleading not guilty to all the charges and has been free on $300,000 bail - is looking at up to 20 years behind bars if convicted.

Holly Robinson - a former Cal State student of Kinzey whom he calls his 'old lady' - has pleaded not guilty to three charges - possession of drugs for sale while armed, possession of drugs for sale and conspiracy. 

She is scheduled for a court hearing next October along with Jeremy Disney, 33 - the only only other alleged co-conspirator not already convicted and sentenced - who is facing charges of conspiracy and possession of drugs for sale.

Since his arrest, seven people arrested in connection with the Kinzey case have already pleaded guilty to charges ranging from conspiracy to drug possession, and been sentenced. 

Yet Kinzey's day in court has been scheduled and postponed more than a dozen times. He was due in court Wednesday, but the hearing has been delayed again, due to arguments between prosecutors and defense attorneys over whether wire taps and other evidence gathered by cops over a six-month investigation are admissible in court.

How does a man like Kinzey, whose worst encounter with cops until this point was a traffic ticket…a highly educated academic who researched the effects of video games on children and who tweeted about his concerns over childhood obesity…end up as the alleged leader of a notorious biker gang that used violence and intimidation to enforce a thriving crystal meth-dealing operation, a gang whose members wear F.T.W. (F--- The World) patches on their black leather jackets?

Kinzey's first link with a biker gang was in 1997 when he was teaching at the University of Mississippi where he joined the Boozefighters Motorcycle Club, just as he was getting a divorce. 

'I was shocked', said one neighbor in the upscale market street where Kinzey lived with Robinson (above). The neighbor recalled Kinzey having occasional visits from friends on motorbikes, but no rowdy parties or trouble

After he moved to San Bernardino 12 years ago, he hooked up with several different biker groups before forming the local chapter of the Devil's Diciples in 2008.

He kept Skinz, his alleged secret biker persona - and his tattoos - well hidden. 'Nobody on the faculty here at Cal State knew that he was a member of a biker group,' said university spokesman Joe Gutierrez.

As for Kinzey's students at Cal State, the only clue he gave them of his alleged secret double life was his Harley Davidson which he often rode to work. 

While a couple of his students said Kinzey had seemed distracted just before his arrest and was sometimes late for class, the majority gave him rave reviews on the website RateMyProfessor.com.

'Great teacher, great person, great friend'……..'Awesome'…….'A cool cat'…….'He really cares about you'. 

These are just a few of the many comments students posted about their beloved, goateed professor, whom Cal State first placed on paid administrative leave before letting him go in December 2012.

While many who know Professor Stephen Kinzey says what a great guy he is, his alleged secret double - Skinz - is a mystery, even to his family. 

'I just don’t understand what's going on here', said his dad, Hank, who believes in his son enough to post a $30,000 cash bond for his bail. 'The Stephen Kinzey they're accusing is not the son I know. My son is a wonderful, decent man.'
