The son of late underworld figure George Freeman has been taken into custody before being sentenced for his involvement in the manufacture of $3 million worth of ecstasy. 

Adam Freeman, a well know nightclub identity in Sydney, pleaded guilty last September to his role in a drug manufacturing
 operation, two years after he was extradited from Thailand. 

The 31 year old was due to face a sentence hearing in the Downing Centre district court on Thursday, but the matter
 was adjourned until October.

The son of late underworld figure George Freeman has been taken into custody before being sentenced for his involvement in the manufacture of $3 million worth of ecstasy.

Freeman did not apply for bail.

'Bail is no longer applied for therefore, it is refused,' Judge Chris Hoy said.

Freeman was extradited from Thailand in August 2011 after a global arrest warrant was issued. 

In December, 2010, he fled to Bangkok, a day after two of his co-acused were arrested in New South Wales near Tamworth, over 20 kilograms of precursor drugs used at make esctasy. 

The two men were busted after they were apparently pulled over for an RBT and officers noticed drugs and drug manufacturing equipment in their hire van. Analysis of glass vases in the van found they contained fingerprints including those of Freeman's, the court heard previously. 

Farmer Gary Rennolds told the hearing he was promised $50,000 for letting three men use his shearing shed for about three weeks in late 2010. 

Freeman's DNA was found on a cigarette butt at the shed. 

He will be sentenced on October 27 for manufacturing a commercial quantity of ecstasy, worth an estimated $3 million. 

Adam Freeman was arrested at the weekend after a man fell 10 metres from a balcony in Bondi

Earlier this month Freeman was arrested over the alleged assault of a man who fell from a balcony in North Bondi.

Mr Freeman was taken to Waverley Police Station after police were called to an apartment on Brighton Boulevard just before 10am.

Police arrived at the North Bondi property to find a 29-year-old man had fallen 10 metres from the balcony of the apartment.

'At the scene they found a 29-year-old man with face and spinal injuries,' a police statement said.

'The man was treated at the scene by paramedics and taken to hospital.'

The 29-year-old victim was taken St Vincents Hospital in Darlinghurst with head injuries.

A spokesperson for NSW Police told Daily Mail Australia that a '31-year-old has since been released pending further enquiry and no charges had been laid at this point'.

Freeman is well-known on the Kings Cross club scene and once owned the now defunct nightclub Lady Lux, with nightclub owner, John Ibrahim.

The Thailand trip the senior officer was referring to occurred on December 16, 2010, when Freeman paid cash for a one-way ticket out of Australia after two of his co-accused were busted with 20 kilograms of precursor drugs used to make ecstasy.

The two men were apparently pulled over for an RBT and were driving a hired van when police discovered the drugs.

Freeman handed himself into authorities in Sydney on August 6 2011 after a global warrant was issued for his arrest.

Freeman, 31, spent time in Klong Prem Prison in 2010 before he returned to Australian after a global warrant was issued for his arrest

Before returning to Sydney he spend 30 days inside the notorious Klong Prem Prison, known as the 'Bangkok Hilton', 

In September 2013 - after spending some time in Long Bay Jail later in 2011 but being released on $860,000 bail - he pleaded guilty to manufacturing a commercial supply to ecstasy just days before his trial was due to start.

He could face up to 25 years behind bars on the drug charges.

The self-confessed drug manufacturer dated swimsuit model Dominique Le Toullec, who is said to have visited him in Thailand back in 2010

Freeman's latest brush with the law comes after he was on the luxury Oscar II boat in Rose Bay when it was shot up early in January.

Also on board were alleged Brothers for Life gang members Farhad Qaumi, his brother Mumtaz and another man, Fawad Bari, who was allegedly a member of the Blacktown chapter.

The Daily Telegraph report the men were on the boat with a group of women as part of a 'send-off' for Freeman due to his impending sentencing.

The yacht was docked at the time of the attack and police sources said the hit was organised by some of the men who were on board the boat.

Farhad Qaumi was hit in the shoulder during the shooting.

Freeman previously dated Dominique Le Toullec, whose Facebook page describes her as 'Personal Trainer - International/Australian Glamour & Fitness Model'.

She is believed to have visited him when he was holed up in Thailand, though had no link to any of her boyfriend's crimes.

Le Toullec recently spent some time in the US to watch the Surf Open and take part in some photoshoots. It is unclear if the pair are still an item.

The boy's father George Freeman is one of Australia's most famous organised crime figures, who was a one time bookie and illegal casino operator.

He served some time in jail during the 50s and 60s, had links to the drug trade in the 70s and 80s, and was later named in an organised crime Royal Commission.

George Freeman's life has been detailed in two of the Underbelly series' that aired on Channel Nine, which implied his involvement in an international drug syndicate and the unsolved murder of another criminal.

He survived an attempt on his life in 1970 when he was shot in the neck but died 11 years later from an asthma attack and heart failure when his eldest son was just eight.
