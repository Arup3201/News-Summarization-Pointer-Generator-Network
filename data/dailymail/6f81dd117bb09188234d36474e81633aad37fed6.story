A woman shot her friend in the leg accidentally while they waited for coffee at Starbucks.

When Pamela Beck, from Pinellas Park, put her bags down to pay for her coffee on Saturday afternoon, a loaded gun she had forgotten about fired from her handbag.

The bullet from the .25 caliber semi-automatic Titan handgun hit Amie Peterson, 38, above the knee as the friends waited in line at the Tyrone Square Mall Starbucks in St Petersburg, Florida.

Friendly fire: Pamela Beck was at this Starbucks in Tyrone Square Mall, Florida, when she accidentally shot her friend Amie Peterson

Mike Puetz, a St Petersburg police spokesman, told The Huffington Post that when Ms Beck, 51, put her bag down it 'hit the ground hard', causing the gun to fire.

The Florida woman, who police say does not have a concealed carry weapons permit, had been given the gun by her father about a year ago and did not mean to bring it out with her, Bay News 9 said.

'She had forgotten about it,' Mr Puetz said.

Ms Peterson was taken to a nearby medical centre for treatment.

The case has been referred to prosecutors.

A spokesman for Starbucks told 10News:
 'The safety and security of our partners who are our employees and 
customers is our top priority. We are aware of the accident that took 
place and are thankful that nobody was seriously injured.'

She added: 'We wish those involved a speedy recovery and at this time we are working with local authorities and defer any specific questions on the investigation to them.'

It is the latest in a series of accidental shootings this month.

A three-year-old boy shot himself and died after finding his uncle's gun in a bedroom; a two-year-old girl in Kentucky was shot dead by her brother; and a six-year-old girl from Fort Lauderdale was seriously injured when her brother found a handgun.It is not the first time that a gun has fired accidentally from a woman's handbag in Starbucks. In 2011, the Associated Press reported on a girl whose gun went off in her bag, nearly hitting customers.

The coffee chain has been criticised in the past by the anti-gun lobby for refusing to ban armed customers.

American businesses are allowed to ban customers who are carrying guns, but Starbucks says that it respects local and state laws.

In a statement on gun laws, released on its website in 2010, Starbucks said: 'The political, policy and legal debates around these issues belong in the legislatures and courts, not in our stores.' 

In 2010, 73,505 Americans had to seek emergency hospital treatment for gunshot wounds in 2010, according to figures by the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, a national group promoting smart gun laws.

Recent figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show almost seven people are wounded by gunfire every 60 minutes in the U.S.
