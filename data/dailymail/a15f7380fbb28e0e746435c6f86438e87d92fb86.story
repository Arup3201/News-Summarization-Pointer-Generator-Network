A ten-year-old took her own life in her bedroom after allegedly being bulled at school.

Jasmine McClain was found hanged by her mother Samantha West at their home in Chadbourn, North Carolina on Monday evening.

Ms West said: 'She was just such a loving child. I just lost it because she took her last breath in my arms.'

Ms West described her young daughter as 'sweet and fun-loving' and said she was unaware that Jasmine was so tormented by bullying at her local elementary school. 

Ms West told local TV station WRAL-TV: 'It's a shame that kids are that cruel.'

Chadbourn Police Chief Steven Shaw ruled the death a suicide but his investigation lead him to Facebook where comments had been posted by Jasmine's classmates that she had been targeted.

Chief Shaw said: 'Children started coming forward and making accusations that she was bullied - and bullied bad - in school.'

The police chief was unable to comment on whether anyone was liable for Jasmine's death but said that the investigation was ongoing.

It is believed that Jasmine was tormented at Chadbourn Elementary, where she was picked on her about her clothes and shoes.

She didn't attend school for a short while before returning to classes last month. Her mother said she had dreaded going back.

Chadburn Elementary, where the flag flew at half-mast following Jasmine's death, said they had conducted their own internal investigation and were working closely with the police.

Concerns have been raised after several children committed suicide in recent months following reports of bullying.

A ten-year-old girl hanged herself after being the victim of bullying in the town of Ridge Farm, Illinois last week.

Ashlynn Connor, an honour-roll student and cheerleader, had begged her mother to be home-schooled. The following day, she was found hanged by one of her siblings.

Her mother Stacy said she knew about the bullying, where other children would call Ashlynn 'a slut' and 'ugly', but never thought it would drive her daughter to kill herself.

Two months ago, Jamey Rodemeyer, a teenager from Buffalo, New York, was found dead outside his home. Jamey was bullied both at school and online about being gay.

The 14-year-old was a big fan of Lady Gaga and sent her a message on Twitter saying 'Bye mother monster, thank you for all you have done, paws up forever,' before he killed himself.

Moved by his death, the pop star performed her song 'Hair' a few days after Jamey’s death and dedicated it to him.
