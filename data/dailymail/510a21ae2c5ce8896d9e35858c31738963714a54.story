Its decadent surroundings hosted numerous Hollywood legends as they laid eyes on the big screen for the very first time.

But having sat desolate for more than 30 years - the crumbling Loew's Kings Theatre in New York is finally being brought back to life.

The 3,200-seater turned its lights out in 1977, having first opened to the public in 1929.

Regeneration: Loew's Kings Theatre in Brooklyn is to be redeveloped in a $93 million project after lying dormant for 35 years

Decadent: The original interior of the French Renaissance-style theatre that was closed in 1977

Since its closure, the once-bustling theatre slipped into a state of dilapidation and decay, but a $93 million regeneration project was announced on Wednesday.

New York mayor Michael Bloomberg said that the regeneration would create 50 permanent jobs and 500 construction jobs.

Mr Bloomberg said that the theatre will be 'the Radio City Music Hall of Brooklyn'.

Hollywood legend Barbara Streisand once worked as an usherette at the French Renaissance-style theatre, vowing that her name would appear in lights above its door.

Sylvester Stallone held a similar position, while Bob Hope appeared before the Loews Kings's adoring crowd.

Streisand told an audience in 1995: 'I went to the movies long before I ever went to the theatre. I’d go to the Loew’s Kings in Flatbush every Saturday.

Dilapidated: The theatre has become seriously dilapidated since its closure but work will begin next week with the removal of asbestos and repairs to the roof

Announcement: New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg broke the ground of the redevelopment, which will be carried out by Texas-based Ace Theatrical Group, on Wednesday

Jobs: Mayor Bloomberg said the project, due to finish in 2015, will secure 50 permanent jobs when completed and also entail 500 construction jobs

She said that she went 'to escape into a world of fantasy - and also because they had the greatest Mellowrolls'.

Construction work will begin within the next week, starting with repairs to the roof and the removal of asbestos.

Texas-based Ace Theatrical Group is taking on the project, which has been backed by the city's Economic Development Corp.

The redevelopment will include a huge staircase, rose-coloured marble and wood-panelled walls.

Seven chandeliers will dazzle visitors as they enter the lobby, while paintings on the original domed 70-foot roof will be restored.

Restoration: The theatre will undergo an extensive refurbishment, including a restoration of its painted 70-ft roof

A four-story stagehouse will also be built at the back of the theater, facilitating the staging of more expansive theatre productions.

Brooklyn Borough President Marty Markowitz was also a key player in the redevelopment.

Mr Markowitz said that Brooklyn was getting back an 'historic jewel'.

He described the project as a 'dream come true', perhaps swayed by sentimentality, given that he went on his first date there.

'It’s gonna be a movie place on steroids, theater, music, dance, cultural activities,' said Ace’s David Anderson.

It is hoped the theatre will open in early 2015, hosting more than 200 concerts, performances, and musicals every year.

The movie palace was sold in 1979 and later taken over by the City of New York.
