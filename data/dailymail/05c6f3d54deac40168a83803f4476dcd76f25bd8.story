Ryan Giggs is busy trying to muster something - anything - from the wreckage that is Manchester United's disastrous season, but David Moyes had to get away from it all.

The 51-year-old was axed by the club on Tuesday, with Giggs named interim manager.

And a day before United beat Norwich City on Saturday, Moyes was pictured in Florida as he tried to put a dismal week behind him in the sun.

Moyes was pictured landing in Miami and heading out for a meal in the state, which is home of the Glazer family.

The American businessmen own United, and cut Moyes' six-year contract at the club short.

It is believed that he has reached a financial settlement with the club, thought to be around £7million.

And while he suffered in the week, at least the Scot got to relax with his wife Pamela with a dinner for two in South Florida.

A statement for the League Managers Association said: ‘The LMA and Manchester United are pleased to confirm that terms of settlement have been agreed between the Club and David Moyes in respect of the termination of his employment.

‘A settlement agreement is in the process of being finalised. No further comment will be made in relation to this issue.’

There have been allegations of players
 mocking Moyes behind his back in his later months of Old Trafford, and 
he made no mention of them in his own LMA statement.

Part
 of it read: 'In my short time at the club I have learnt what special 
places Old Trafford and Carrington are. I would like to thank the United
 staff for making me feel so welcome and part of the United family from 
my first day. And of course thank you to those fans who have supported 
me throughout the season. I wish you and the club all the best for the 
future.'

Sir Alex Ferguson, 
the man who hand picked Moyes to succeed him at United, has also spoken 
out about the departure, claiming it was 'upsetting the way it came 
out.'

Giggs takes charge of his first United fixture on Saturday against Norwich, but Louis van Gaal is the favourite to land the full time role.

According to Dutch paper De Telegraaf, which has close links to Van Gaal's camp, the bookmakers' favourite has already sealed the Old Trafford hotseat.

Sportsmail understands a meeting took place between Van Gaal's representatives and United chiefs in the last couple of days.

And should he take the reins, he would be keen to bring in fellow countryman Patrick Kluivert as his assistant.
