Moschino - as ever - didn't take themselves too seriously this season with a bright and quirky presentation at London Collections: Men on Sunday.

Luxurious fur, patchwork double denim and leopard print outfits with a certain Tarzan theme were just some of the eye-opening ensembles for AW15.

And the models certainly bucked the trend for the male waif with their bulging quads, perky pecs and ripped abs.

Moschino showed a bright and quirky presentation at London Collections: Men on Sunday

Double denim and colour clashing purple orange and green were all themes for AW15

Former America's Next Top Model judge Rob Evans also strutted his stuff on the runway

The overruling theme was certainly ski season, as snow fell onto the runway.

Many models wore chunky furry boots, ski goggles and cosy Cossack hats, as well as bright and shiny puffa jackets.

Shirts, trousers and jackets made from cream satin came printed with multicoloured lillies, while a fluffy hat and trousers combo (who needs a shirt with that torso?) came in a black and white dalmatian print.

And Jourdan Dunn, 24, made an appearance Walking the Moschino AW15 runway.

The brunette beauty diverted all eyes away from the male models for a moment and firmly onto her stunning lingerie-clad body.

The first black British model to go solo on the cover of the magazine since Naomi Campbell pounded the runway in a winter-ready, fur-lined coat and oversized boots.

Though her undergarments were on show in the faux, falling snow as she left her gold lame coat open to reveal a perfect set of abs.

The Victoria's Secret Model was rivaling the men with her toned body, not uncomfortable with wowing the crowds in just her lingerie.
