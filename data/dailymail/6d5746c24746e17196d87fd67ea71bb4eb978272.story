Legal action: The Government is making a final attempt to stop letters from Prince Charles (pictured last week) to ministers being released

Publishing dozens of letters in which Prince Charles lobbied ministers would infringe his ‘freedom of expression’, the Government claimed today.

The heir to the throne’s correspondence with senior politicians on major issues of the day forms an important part of his training to become King and must remain confidential, lawyers argued.

Former attorney general Dominic Grieve ruled that 27 memos sent by the Prince to ministers in seven Whitehall departments putting forward his views about policy could not be released.

David Cameron and his Cabinet backed the decision even though they had not seen all of the letters, which date from when Tony Blair was prime minister.

But the Court of Appeal overturned the ban, finding that Mr Grieve did not have ‘reasonable grounds’ for blocking the disclosure of the correspondence.

The Government today appealed to the UK’s most senior judges at the Supreme Court in London in a final attempt to stop the Prince’s campaigning letters being made available for the public to read.

James Eadie QC, for the Attorney General, argued that releasing Charles’ memos to ministers would be a ‘breach of confidence’.

‘Everyone has the right to respect for their correspondence,’ he said in a written submission to the court.

‘Such respect is necessary not only as an aspect of privacy, but also to enable freedom of expression, which would inevitably be inhibited by the removal of the right to communicate privately.

‘All the more so in the case of the Prince of Wales, whose freedom to express himself publicly is constrained by his role as heir to the throne.’

Charles has been accused of meddling in politics through his handwritten ‘black spider memos’ to politicians on topics about which he cares passionately, including GM foods, complementary medicine, farming and architecture.

By contrast, when he succeeds his mother and becomes King, he will be bound by the long-standing constitutional convention that British monarchs can only encourage, warn and be consulted by the Government of the day.

The unique court case heard todayis the culmination of a nine-year legal battle that began in 2005 when a journalist for the Guardian newspaper applied to get copies of the Prince’s letters to ministers under the Freedom of Information Act.

Letter lover: Prince Charles is said to have sent 1,000 letters a year at peak periods in his life

A defiant Prince Charles has always maintained he has the right  to express his forthright views to ministers even after he becomes King.

At peak periods, his passionate words have poured out at the rate of 1,000 letters a year to ministers and other public figures. 

As the furore over his 'black spider' letters peaked in 2012, the heir to throne was said to be unrepentant about the row furore sparked by the Government’s decision to stop 27 ‘particularly frank’ letters written to ministers in the last Labour government to be revealed. 

Courtiers told the Mail that it is the prince’s ‘right and absolute duty’ to correspond with politicians over issues that affect his country and future subjects.

And sources close to the prince made clear that Charles will continue to air his opinions, even during his private meetings with the Prime Minister after he accedes to the throne.

'The Prince of Wales absolutely sees it as his duty to make his views known to ministers,’ they said. ‘He is a man of passionate belief and will always strive to make his views clear.’

As a self-confessed ‘interfering busybody’, Charles has become renowned for expressing his strong views on a huge variety of issues ranging from youth opportunity to architecture and the environment.

His prolific missives are known as ‘black spider memos’ because of his scrawled handwriting.

Explaining his willingness to get involved in issues and causes he said himself: 'The trouble is, I always feel that unless I rush about doing things and trying to help furiously, I will not (and the monarchy will not) be seen to be relevant and I will be considered a mere playboy.’

Mr Grieve argued that Charles’ correspondence helped to prepare him for the exercise of his powers as King, the court heard.

‘Through the exchange of views with Ministers, the Prince of Wales would better understand the business of government and strengthen his relations with Ministers,’ Mr Eadie said.

‘Through interaction and correspondence of any nature, the Prince of Wales may be developing relationships with Ministers who at any moment may form his Government when he becomes sovereign.’ 

Mr Eadie said Parliament gave weight to the ‘public interest in preserving our constitutional monarchy’ when it passed the Freedom of Information Act by allowing for communications with royals to be withheld unless there was a clear public interest in releasing them.

But lawyers for the Guardian argued that powers allowing a Cabinet Minister or the Attorney General to overturn any tribunal ruling that information should be disclosed under the Act were ‘unique’ in British law.

This power has been used only seven times in the past 10 years since the Freedom of Information Act came into force in full in 2005.

Dinah Rose QC, for the Guardian, argued in written submissions that the Attorney General was ‘neither independent nor impartial’ because he was a member of the Government seeking to stop the Prince’s letters being released.

The case is believed to be the first time that anyone has challenged the Attorney General’s powers to block access to information.

The hearing continues tomorrow. The judges will make their ruling at a later date.
