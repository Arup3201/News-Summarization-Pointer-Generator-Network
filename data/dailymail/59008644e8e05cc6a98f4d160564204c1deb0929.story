The Premier League is well and truly underway, with several players settling in to their new surroundings and impressing in the second gameweek. 

West Ham and Tottenham were the real winners this weekend with convincing victories against Crystal Palace and QPR.

Here, EA Sports crunch the numbers to reveal the top 10  Premier League performers from Saturday, Sunday and Monday. Nacer Chadli, Mauro Zarate and Eden Hazard all make the list, but who comes out on top in our Player Performance Index PPI chart?

10. Ryan Shawcross, Stoke (PPI score: 34.7)

Despite Mark Hughes focusing in the summer on adding some much needed fire power to Stoke's ranks, they had to rely on a defender to net their first goal of the season. The captain stepped up when the Potters needed him most, and was also dominant at the back with 12 clearances.

The EA Sports PPI is the official player rating index of the  Premier League.

It measures a player's contribution to the success of his team. The intention is to remove any opinion bias and only work with proven statistical measurements which become more accurate as the season progresses. So, what are the six indices?

1. Winning Performance

2. Player's Performance per match

3. Appearances

4. Goals scored

5. Assists

6. Clean sheets

9. Cesc Fabregas, Chelsea (34.9)

Another Premier League game, another assist. The Spaniard was again inventive in the blue of Chelsea against Leicester on Saturday, setting up Eden Hazard for a goal that finally sunk a resolute defence at Stamford Bridge.

The former Arsenal man is settling in perfectly in west London, accumulating a pass accuracy of 93.5 per cent.

8. Carlton Cole, West Ham (35.9)

Sam Allardyce is desperate to bring in another striker to West Ham, but if the performance at Selhurst Park was anything to go by, the Hammers don't need one.

Cole, often castigated by fans. lead the line expertly  against Crystal Palace, netting in the 3-1 win.

The target man also boasted a pass completion rate of 85.7 per cent. 

Instrumental: Chelsea's Cesc Fabregas comes in at No 9, gaining another assist and a pass accuracy of 93.5 

No 8: Carlton Cole hit back at his critics with a fine display against Crystal Palace

7. Stewart Downing, West Ham (37.7)

Another West Ham man who has been criticised in recent years, Downing was dangerous all afternoon on Saturday.

The winger also scored in the victory, sending in many crosses, but also keeping his pass completion rate at an impressive 81.6% (37 successful). 

Tricky: Stewart Downing was at the top of his game on the wing, scoring in the 3-1 win on Saturday

6. Cheikhou Kouyate, West Ham (38.3)

Allardyce believes the Senegalese summer arrival can be the 'next Patrick Vieira'. Some pressure, but the £7m man produced all those powerful credentials and more against Palace.

Five tackles, one assist and five successful dribbles. All you can ask for from the heartbeat of your side.

No 6: Cheikhou Kouyate has been compared with Patrick Vieira and was impressive this weekend

5. Mauro Zarate, West Ham (41.5)

Completing the West Ham party is Mauro Zarate, who really stood out on his debut.

The tricky Argentine netted to cap a fine afternoon, where he played off Carlton Cole and linked the midfield and attack.

As if a goal wasn't enough, his pass completion rate was up at 92.9 per cent, an unheard of figure for a West Ham forward. 

Settling in: Mauro Zarate controlled proceedings on his debut for the Hammers against Palace

4. Emmanuel Adebayor, Tottenham (41.6)

One goal, one assist and a 92.9 per cent pass completion. It doesn't get much better for a striker.

Adebayor typified Tottenham's stunning showing against QPR on Sunday, leading a free-flowing line-up that dominated proceedings at White Hart Lane.

3. Eden Hazard, Chelsea (45.4)

There's no doubt Leicester made Chelsea sweat at Stamford Bridge on Saturday... but in the end quality shines through.

Hazard kept working at the visitors' defence, twisting and turning, and was eventually rewarded with a well worked goal.

The Belgian also completed 37 passes in the opposition half, and amassed six successful dribbles.

On form: The Belgian completed six dribbles and 37 passes in the opposition half on Saturday

2. Nacer Chadli, Tottenham (45.6) 

Chadli is joint top scorer of the Premier League. I bet you didn't think you'd be saying that after two games.

The Belgian midfielder was in and out of the team last year but really came of age at White Hart Lane, netting twice in a comprehensive victory.

A 92.9 per cent pass completion rate topped off his fine afternoon. 

No 2: Nacer Chadli finally shone for Tottenham against QPR on Sunday

1. Stevan Jovetic, Manchester City (49.6)

Often criticised in his first season at the Etihad Stadium, the Montenegrin struggled for form and fitness after moving from Fiorentina.

With Sergio Aguero and Alvaro Negredo out of the picture in the summer though, Jovetic impressed in pre-season and seems to be bringing that form to the Premier Leauge.

Two goals and a fine performance against Liverpool sees him top EA Sports list this week, netting his double from just three shots in total. 

No 1: Stevan Jovetic stepped up for Manchester City with two goals against Liverpool on Monday night

Top of the charts: Two goals and an all-round fine performance helped Jovetic top this week's table
