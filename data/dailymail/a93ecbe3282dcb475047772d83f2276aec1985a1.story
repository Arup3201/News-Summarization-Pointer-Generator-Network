They say nice guys finish last. Now, scientists have confirmed there is truth in the old adage – at least when it comes to salaries.

A study claims friendly staff receive lower wages than their less agreeable colleagues. Despite working just as hard, they are often reluctant to push for pay rises, too focused on team work and overly concerned about being liked.

Researchers at the University of Sheffield made the discovery while looking at the impact of personality traits on workers' productivity and pay. 

A University of Sheffield study claims friendly staff receive lower wages than their less agreeable colleagues

Their study found: 'More agreeable workers tend to earn less in the actual labour market, but their productivity is similar when measured in the laboratory setting.' 

They defined agreeableness as being compliant, modest, trustworthy and sympathetic.

The study found women were most likely to show agreeable personality traits, perhaps one reason for the gender pay gap.

Being agreeable made workers more successful in team work, but had three negative effects on their performance. 

Friendly staff are often reluctant to push for pay rises, too focused on team work and overly concerned about being liked, according to the study

'First, helping others may reduce individual productivity,' the study found. 'Secondly, agreeable people may be less effective when bargaining their wage. Finally, agreeable individuals may enter less stable, lower paid occupations.'

The study was presented at the Royal Economic Society's 2015 annual conference in Manchester yesterday by Ana Nuevo-Chiquero, of The University of Sheffield, who conducted the research alongside Australian and Spanish academics.

They analysed the personalities and productivity levels of students at the University of New South Wales in laboratory conditions, and analysed a host of academic reports on personality and wages.

It found that, while conscientious and emotionally stable workers earn more money, being too open could harm your career.

While openness with colleagues indicated an artistic, curious and imaginative worker, it could make them less likely to obey the rules, which could cause problems at a formal workplace.

Neuroticism, which researchers linked to mood swings and unpredictability, also impacted performance as these workers often lacked self-confidence and were insecure.
