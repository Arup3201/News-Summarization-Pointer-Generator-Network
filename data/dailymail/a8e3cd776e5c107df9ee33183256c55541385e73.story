Krystian Bielik, signed in January for £2.4million from Legia Warsaw, had also been expected to make his debut.

But the 17-year-old was called up to train with the first-team squad on Monday as Arsene Wenger prepared for Tuesday's Premier League match against Leicester.

Arsenal U21s secured a 2-1 victory against Newcastle in front of 1,305 fans. 

Alex Iwobi put Arsenal ahead midway through the first half, cutting in from the left to bury a shot into the bottom corner. 

Dan Barlaser volleyed in from 18 yards to equalise for Newcastle, but Austin Lipman scored a 90th-minute winner to claim the points.
