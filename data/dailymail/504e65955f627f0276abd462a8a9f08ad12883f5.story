A weekend drive to go pick up a new puppy turned into an horrific tragedy for a young Illinois mother when a wrong turn left both her little children dead.

Theresa Godwin, 30, was behind the wheel in rural Jefferson County outside St. Louis March 1 when her car was struck by oncoming traffic, killing her 11-year-old son Ethan Price and his beloved little sister Bryleigh Greene, 4.

Steven Galvin, 52, and his wife Cynthia, 53, whose Dodge Ram pickup was collided with Godwin's Cavalier, suffered moderate injuries.
