Scotland  will be left without any weapons to defend itself if it votes for independence and refuses to take on its share of UK debt, an MP has warned.

Ian Davidson, the chairman of the influential Scottish affairs committee, said that Alex Salmond’s ‘cavalier’ plan to renege on Scotland’s debts if he does not get his way on the pound would ‘poison’ negotiations with the UK.

He warned that Scotland would be denied access to military equipment and could be left with ‘a navy with no ships, an air force with no planes and an army with no guns’.

Mr Salmond has been under intense pressure to give details of an alternative if Westminster does not agree to the share the pound, but he has said he has no intention of proposing a ‘plan B’.

All three main UK parties have promised to veto a currency union if Scotland votes for independence on 18 September.

But Mr Salmond has insisted that monetary union with the rest of the UK would go ahead and promised not to help repay British debt if it does not.

Yesterday, Mr Davidson warned that an independent Scotland could not expect to receive military equipment if it walks away from UK debt.

He told the Mail: ‘Any decision by a separate Scotland to repudiate its share of the National Debt will clearly have an impact upon any potential division of assets and liabilities, since the National Debt is the major liability.

‘It is difficult to imagine the UK handing over assets such as warships, aircraft and other military equipment when the Scottish share of the borrowing that has helped pay for these items is not being repaid.

‘Thus debt repudiation could result in a Scottish Navy with no ships, a Scottish Air Force with no planes and a Scottish Army with no guns.’

The Labour MP for Glasgow South West said that the UK could try and block Scotland joining the EU or Nato if it did not take on any existing debt.

He said: ‘Any debt repudiation by a separate Scotland will poison the waters of all other negotiations.

‘The SNP will have to clarify whether a Scotland in dispute with the UK over debt will be eligible to apply to join the EU? Or Nato?

‘Clearly the collaboration and support from the UK for any Scottish application to such organisations, and for the negotiation of terms, is less likely to be forthcoming if a separate Scotland is reneging on debt.’

He also warned that a debt default would ruin Scotland’s reputation for fiscal responsibility and stop it being able to raise money for spending.

‘As for defence procurement – there is little chance of orders for equipment, which will be partly funded by new borrowings, being placed in a Scotland which will not pay its share of previous debts,’ he said.

‘Thus debt repudiation will accelerate the job losses in defence industries that will follow separation.

‘Now that the First Minister is making debt repudiation one of his strategic objectives then voters in Scotland need to be aware of the consequences.’

The UK Treasury will today publish new expert analysis that shows more than a tenth of Scottish jobs are linked to trade with the UK.

The figures, based upon independent academic research from Professor Brian Ashcroft of Strathclyde Business School, reveal that almost 270,000 jobs are connected with UK trade.
