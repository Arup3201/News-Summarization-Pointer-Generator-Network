Sen. Mitch McConnell, the GOP's minority leader in Congress' upper house, strode onto the stage Thursday at the Conservative Political Action Conference with real firepower: a flint-lock, muzzle-loading rifle hoisted over his head.

The weapon was a gift for Tom Coburn, a retiring conservative senator from Oklahoma. But the firearm, though silent, made as much noise as McConnell.

Easily the most weakly applauded keynote speaker in the CPAC event's first day, McConnell channeled the late Charlton Heston's famous National Rifle Association moment, when he said the government could take his guns 'from my cold, dead hands!' – and then the moment was over.

His speech, if another Republican had delivered it, might have gone over with as much spark as Chris Christie or Donald Trump brought to their moments in the spotlight.

Not exactly Charlton Heston: The film legend famously lifted a Winchester lever-action rifle over his head at the 2003 NRA annual convention, shouting that the government could take his guns 'from my cold, dead hands'

Gun rights are a rallying point for many conservatives, and the National Rifle Association had several booths inside the CPAC exhibit hall -- including a laser-sight target practice game

'The president of the United States is treating our constitution worse than a place mat at Denny’s,' he said.

'I’ve spent so much time over at the supreme court trying to stop these guys that I’m practically on a first-name basis with the bailiff.'

But McConnell, known more for his compromising than his fighting, couldn't win over a crowd of the nation's most committed and strident right-wing activists.

They came to suburban Washington, D.C. this week to hear Ted Cruz, Rand Paul and Sarah Palin, not the senator who is running a dead heat with a liberal's liberal, Kentucky Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes – and still faces a primary challenge beforehand.

'If I'm given the opportunity to lead the U.S. Senate next year, I won’t let you down,' McConnell said Thursday.

Few applauded.

Misfire: The establishment Republican McConnell brought the house to a dull murmur, compared with the tea party renegades who drove thousands to applaud

Even if the Senate returns to Republican control after November, McConnell might not make it back to Washington to see it.

He entered the CPAC stage to the sound of Bon Jovi's 'Living on a Prayer.'

So the six-term incumbent is pulling out all the stops in an attempt to court red-meat conservatives, even with gun-rights imagery that better fit NRA honcho Wayne LaPierre, who would speak on the same stage three hours later.

He left his tricorn hat and hunting boots at home.

The NRA, it turns out, provided the rifle as a 'Lifetime Achievement Award' for Sen. Coburn, since the Oklahoman was one of the nation's most consistent Second Amendment hawks.

And McConnell's biggest applause line came when he handed the gun to Coburn. 'This is for you, for your distinguished service,' he said.

The annual CPAC conference brings together thousands of prospective presidential candidates, conservative opinion leaders and tea party activists – and a horde of media.
