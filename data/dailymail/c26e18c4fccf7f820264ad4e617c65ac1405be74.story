Car-nage: A furious brown bear is believed to have staged this stunning revenge attack on the car of a hunter ... after he shot and wounded the animal in the thigh

Bear-faced cheek: The hunter shot the wild brown bear in the thigh forcing it to flee, but next day when he returned to his Ford car, he realised his prey had had the last laugh, and ripped his vehicle to pieces

Was it a bear? Claw marks and footprints were visible in the wet clay at the scene, as if the creature had left his calling card

The hunter shot the wild brown bear in the thigh forcing it to flee, but the next day when he returned to his Ford, he realised his prey had had the last laugh, and ripped his car to pieces.

'The animal ran amok: It scratched the Ford's body, broke the lights, smashed the windscreen, tore the front and rear seats, and ripped off the rear bumper,' reported The Siberian Times.

'The owner shook his head in disbelief.' 

The most surprising fact about the onslaught was that the vehicles belonging to the hunter's friends were completely untouched.

Baffling: The men concluded that the bear has used his acute sense of smell to locate the car of the man who had left him crippled, and wreaked his vengeance. But it left the hunter's friends' cars completely untouched

Big squeeze: The beast apparently even managed to get inside the car in the attack

'That must have been a busy night for the bear, he worked hard,' said the hunter's astonished friend. 'You must have had something sweet inside the car.'

Shocked, the hunter replies: 'No, I didn't.'

The men concluded that the bear has used his acute sense of smell to locate the car of the man who had left him crippled, and wreaked his vengeance.

Nor was there any doubt that the attack was by a bear.

Claw marks and footprints were visible in the wet clay at the scene, as if the creature had left his calling card.

'That must have been a busy night for the bear, he worked hard,' said the hunter's astonished friend. 'You must have had something sweet inside the car'

'The next dilemma for the shocked hunter: what to tell his insurance company?

'Do they cover revenge attacks by wounded bears?', asked the English language website. 

Siberian bears tend to be much bolder toward humans than their shyer, more persecuted European counterparts. 

Siberian bears regularly destroy hunters’ storages and huts where they think there is food. They are also more carnivorous than those in Europe too, hunting mountain hares, reindeer, wapiti or moose by ambushing them from pine trees.

They do not, however, seem to like honey.
