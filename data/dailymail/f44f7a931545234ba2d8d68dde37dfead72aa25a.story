Hundreds of online gamers saw months of work building gigantic warships in a massive community sci-fi game go up in smoke - all thanks to the rather earthly reason of an unpaid bill.

The virtual payment was supposed to ensure that an area of the galaxy in EVE Online was fortified, but the lapse allowed one side to launch a surprise attack.

Some were asleep when it happened and woke up to text alerts telling them the bad news.

An unpaid bill in the online role-playing game EVE Online has led to a virtual space battle involving thousands of players with costly losses in real-world money

In EVE Online, more than 500,000 players 
pilot starships, trade goods and engage in sci-fi espionage – and on 
Monday morning, the biggest battle the game has ever seen lasting 14 hours and involving 
more than 4,000 players, erupted.

EVE Online uses an in-game currency that can be calculated in real-world cash, and the damage from Monday's conflict would have cost $300,000 in the real world.

During the encounter more than 100 Titan vessels were destroyed.

The megaships, which are akin to the Death Star from Star Wars, are the largest ships in the game and are worth about $3,000 each in real-world money.

Monday's EVE Online battle was so huge that it actually put the game's servers under strain

The Titans also take months for gamers to build - that's months in real time, a lot of nights, weekends and days-off actually spent building.

The battle was so complex that at the time of writing, the full results still hadn't been calculated.

Monday’s skirmish first erupted after a member of gamer James Carl’s coalition missed a payment to protect an area that's been used as a staging ground for a war raging between Carl's Pandemic and N3 coalition versus CFC and Russian forces.

The 29-year-old from Costa Mesa, California, said: ‘Supposedly, it was set up for auto-pay, just like any other bill in real life, but either that didn't happen or the money wasn't in the wallet, and then everything just escalated out of control from there.

‘The dust is still settling on that issue. Everyone is just focused right now on fighting to try to regain control of the system.’

Carl was awakened by a messaging app on his phone used by alliance members alerting him that their system B-R5RB was under attack by rivals.

He wasn't scheduled to work in real life Monday, so he spent the entire day sending virtual ships into the fray. He said dozens of his alliance members took the day off work to join the fight, which is being waged by more than 4,000 players - and spectated by thousands more on the game streaming service Twitch.

Monday’s battle was so huge that it actually put the game’s servers under strain.

‘I'd be lying if I said our servers weren't sweating a bit,’ said ‘EVE Online’ spokesman Ned Coker of CCP Games, the Reykjavik, Iceland-based video game developer who created the online universe.

‘Allowing players free movement wherever they want in a game with over half a million players means for some pretty tricky technological requirements.’

To compensate for thousands of starship captains battling each other online, Coker said CCP Games instituted what it calls ‘time dilation,’ which slows down the game's servers to about 10 percent of normal time, so players aren't dropped and their commands are issued in the order in which they were received. Carl said it's made for a massive but slow battle.

The real-world value of ‘EVE Online’ currency is based on an actual exchange rate set up for the game. But the primary basis for value in the game's virtual economy is the time and skill that gamers put into such concepts as the mining of minerals, the selling of goods and services, or the stealing of goods and money (just don't get caught).

However, if players want a shortcut, they can put real-world money into the game to buy ‘EVE’ currency determined by the exchange rate, but the money can only be exchanged from real to virtual.

Meanwhile, Carl is optimistic his coalition will recover from the latest ‘EVE’ upheaval.

‘It looks like CFC is winning, but we're hoping now that all of our U.S. players are online, we'll turn the tide,’ said Carl. ‘Whatever happens, we'll keep going. `EVE' is a universe full of grudges and constantly changing politics. If we were to lose, we'll rebuild. Then, we'll go back and start another war.’
