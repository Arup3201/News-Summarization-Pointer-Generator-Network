It was once just a treat for the weekend, but a new survey has found that the average Brit now forks out £110 per month on takeaway meals every month.

The study found that an average of 12 takeaways is purchased per person per month- a staggering £1,320.

Men have the biggest taste for fast food as they get through an extraordinary 151 takeaways a year, while the figure for women is 126.

Classic: Traditional British fish and chips are no longer the favourite takeaway treat

Meanwhile, Chinese has replaced the English classic of fish and chips as Britain's favourite takeaway.

The survey of 2,000 UK adults looked into the nation's eating habits and how age affects the amount of takeaways we consume.

The biggest fast food consumers are 25 to 34-year-olds who spend as much as £2,626.92 a year on them.

Forty nine per cent of this age group claim they rely on takeaways because they don't have the time or inclination to cook at home.

In contrast, those aged 45 and over spend half - £1,272.78 every twelve months.

The study by discount website vouchercodes.co.uk found those living in the capital are the biggest fast food addicts.

Londoners spend more than double the national average - at £221.63 - on takeaways every month.

Meanwhile, those living in 
Chelmsford, Essex, are the thriftiest and spend just £43.19 on meals 
they haven't prepared themselves each month.

Nation's favourite: Chinese food was the favourite on then poll, with Indian food coming in a close second

Everyday expense: Takeaway's are a part of life for consumers who are too busy to cook

According to the research, sushi is the preferred takeaway choice for women, while fish and chips remains the favoured option for men.

Nationally though, the classic English take-out of fish and chips slipped from the nation's favourite takeaway to third - overtaken by Chinese and Indian.

Ben Hardings, 26, a sales assistant 
from Portsmouth, Hants, said: 'After working a late shift it take a lot 
of effort to prepare a meal when I get home.

'It is so much easier to pick up the phone and order an Indian or a kebab, and they taste really good too.

'I
 probably can't boast the healthiest of diets and I do spend a lot of 
money on takeaways, but it's quite a difficult habit to kick.'

Duncan Jennings, co-founder of vouchercodes.co.uk, said: 'Takeaways are now a part of everyday life for busy consumers.

'Britain
 has always been a nation of food lovers and especially as we have 
nearly every type of cuisine available on the go throughout Britain.

'But, eating on the move no longer needs to be an unhealthy or expensive option.'
