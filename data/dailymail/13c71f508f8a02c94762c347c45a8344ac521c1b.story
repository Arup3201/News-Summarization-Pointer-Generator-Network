David Cameron has nominated Lord Hill of Oareford, pictured, as Britain's next European Commissioner

Brussels chief Jean-Claude Juncker was accused of behaving like a dictator last night after warning he would snub David Cameron for not sending a woman to represent Britain in the EU.

Mr Juncker indicated Britain could expect a lowly European Commission post because of the Prime Minister’s nomination of Lord Hill of Oareford.

Sources said the incoming commission president, opposed by Mr Cameron, had repeatedly told countries he wanted to improve the gender balance of his top team. Downing Street yesterday rejected the call, saying Lord Hill would be an ‘excellent commissioner’.

Lord Stoddart of Swindon accused Mr Juncker of behaving like a dictator. The independent Labour peer said: ‘His behaviour is unacceptable and the Prime Minister should not kowtow to this jumped-up bureaucrat with delusions of grandeur.

‘Unfortunately, Mr Juncker’s attitude is all too common among EU officialdom which, in general, has contempt for democracy.’

Tory MPs also rounded on Mr Juncker. Peter Bone said: ‘How dare he tell us who the best person is for the job. It just demonstrates why people increasingly believe we should have nothing to do with this stupid, politically correct, elitist group of bureaucrats.

‘Mr Juncker should simply butt out. He needs to understand that the more they make these ridiculous decisions … the more clamour there will be among the British public for us to simply get out.’

Fellow Tory Mark Pritchard said it would be an outrage if Britain was refused a major economic portfolio in the commission because of the gender of its candidate.

He added: ‘Perhaps Mr Juncker has forgotten the UK is a net contributor to the EU budget, therefore we should be getting one of the big jobs.’

Mr Juncker has been clear since his selection in July that he wants more female commissioners. In an interview with Austrian newspaper Der Kurier this week he said countries which failed to heed his warning could not expect senior jobs.

David Cameron has been warned that Britain will not get a top Brussels post unless the PM sends a woman

‘A commission without a significant number of women is, in my view, neither legitimate nor credible,’ he said. ‘That is why I am continuing to insist with several heads of state and governments that they send me a female candidate … should there still not be a sufficient number of women, I will need to redress the balance through the portfolio allocation.

‘Female commissioners will then certainly have very good chances of landing an important portfolio or of getting one of the most sought-after posts of vice-president, acting as my deputies.’

Brussels sources acknowledged Mr Juncker’s comments were aimed partly at Mr Cameron. But No 10 yesterday said the commission president had not directly raised concerns about Lord Hill’s gender in recent weeks.
