First Minister Alex Salmond said Scotland would not be stopped from sharing the pound with the rest of the UK if it voted for independence

A majority of English voters think an independent Scotland should not be allowed to use the pound, according to a new poll.

Some 53 per cent of those questioned disagreed with the idea of Scotland continuing to use the pound if it left the UK.

This is more than double the number who said an independent Scotland should be allowed to use sterling. Some 15 per cent said they neither agreed nor disagreed and nine per cent did not know.

It comes as the key issue of what currency an independent Scotland would use comes under scrutiny in the run-up to the independence referendum on September 18.

But a Scottish government adviser said the decision on what currency Scotland should use if it became independent was not up to England.

Crawford Beveridge, chair of the Scottish Government's Fiscal Commission Working Group which considered the issue, said: ‘A currency is not something which can only ever be used by a single country and one country cannot prevent another from using it.

‘Indeed the choice of currency is determined by the laws of a country itself and, more importantly, the confidence people have in it.

‘People can choose to trade in whichever currency they wish. What is up for debate and negotiation is the form of governance for the currency.

‘And, in this regard, I remain firmly of the view that a well-designed monetary union is the best option for both Scotland and the UK post-independence.’

Labour, the Lib Dems and the Tories have all ruled out entering into a currency union with an independent Scotland.

Labour MSP Jackie Baillie said: ‘A currency union would not happen if we left the UK.

‘That's why we need to know Alex Salmond's plan B for what would replace the pound. Would we rush to adopt the euro? Or would we set up a separate unproven currency?

But Scotland’s Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said a separate poll showed 71 per cent of people in Scotland agreed that the ‘pound belongs to Scotland as much as it belongs to the rest of the UK’.

Ms Sturgeon said that research, which was commissioned by Yes Scotland, ‘shows that the No campaign is increasingly out of touch with Scottish opinion on the pound’.

She added: ‘The people of Scotland overwhelmingly believe, by a margin of nearly four to one, that the pound would belong to an independent Scotland every bit as much as the rest of the UK. And they are right, because the pound is Scotland's currency too.’

More than half of English voters do not want an independent Scotland to be allowed to share the pound

Scots will have to pay extra to watch  BBC TV and radio shows if they vote for independence, a former director-general of the Corporation has warned.

Lord Birt attacked as ‘make-believe’ Alex Salmond’s claim that the BBC would provide all its programmes for free in return for the shows produced by the First Minister’s proposed new Scottish Broadcasting Service.

Instead he said the BBC would be under an obligation to licence fee payers in the remainder of the UK to get the best possible price for its shows when they were sold to a separate Scotland.

He said the SBS would only have a programming budget around a tenth the size of the BBC’s and would have to tailor its schedule to its ‘modest means’. This would mean it would have to decide which BBC programmes it could afford to buy.

The net result would be Scottish viewers having to pay to watch or listen to BBC programmes not purchased by their new state broadcaster, he said.

The Department for Work and Pensions meanwhile has defended a memo sent to staff telling them they had to support the UK Government in its objective to maintain the union.

The message, written by the DWP's top civil servant Robert Devereux, was criticised for being ‘ill judged’ amid concerns it could be seen as telling staff in Scotland how to vote in next month's independence referendum.

But the DWP insisted the memo was simply intended to set out for staff the restrictions of the purdah period in the run-up to the September 18 ballot.

The BBC reported the email said: ‘It is important that, as civil servants, we understand why the Scottish independence referendum is different from elections such as a UK general election or a European election.

‘This is because the UK Government has a clear position to maintain the union and so it is legitimate and necessary for UK civil servants to support the Government in this objective.’

Dave Penman, general secretary of senior civil servants' union the FDA, said the memo was ‘ill judged’ and added: ‘It is factually accurate but it probably could have been written a lot more sensitively.’

A DWP spokesman said: ‘Of course the department has not told its staff, or anyone else, how to vote.

‘It was an open letter to all DWP staff setting out Scottish referendum guidance and the role of the civil service. Similar advice has been issued by the Scottish Government.’
