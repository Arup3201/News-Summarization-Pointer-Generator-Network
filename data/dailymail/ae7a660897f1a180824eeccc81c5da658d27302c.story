A mother had a nasty surprise when she found a mystery object in her daughter’s chicken soup – that looked like a chicken embryo

Nicole Montgomery was cooking up some soup for Molly, aged four, when noticed the strangely shaped lump floating in the food.

Ms Montgomery, from Broomfield, Colorady, said she was ‘sick to her stomach’ when she discovered the tiny ‘chicken’ in the Campbell’s Chicken and Stars soup.

Ms Montgomery was heating up Campbell’s Chicken and Stars for her sick daughter, and was shocked to find the mystery object in the canned soup.

‘It's like a train wreck - you can't stop looking at it,’ she told ABC7NewsDenver.

‘I keep thinking, ”How does this happen?” I have no idea.’

Ms Montgomery, who has kept the container of soup in her fridge ever since, said that everyone she has shown it to has said it looks like a dead baby chicken.

The lump, the size of a lima bean, appears to have both feet and a beak, but neither Ms Montgomery nor Campbell’s Soup Company can identify what it is.

Investigation: Campbell's Soup Company have sent a courier to pick up Ms Montgomery's food container to investigate the mystery lump

When she called the manufacturer they initially said such a thing was impossible, but is now investigating the matter, sending FedEx to pick up the container from Ms Montgomery’s home.

‘I just can't stop thinking about it,’ Ms Montgomery said.

‘It makes me sick to my stomach to think about what was in that soup. I know things get in the manufacturing process all the time, but this is a big company that should know a little bit better.’

Campbell's Soup Company issued a statement regarding the complaint, saying they are investigating the matter of the mystery lump to determine its possible cause.

‘Campbell Soup Company takes all claims of product contamination very seriously.

‘We are in the process of evaluating the claim and have not yet received the exhibit from the consumer to conduct our investigation.’
