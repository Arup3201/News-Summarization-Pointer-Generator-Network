A catering company makes a staggering 500 mile round trip every day of the school year to deliver lunches to pupils, it has been revealed.

Meals for more than 100 schools in Dorset are prepared 230 miles away in Nottingham before they're transported in refrigerated lorries across the country - a journey that takes up to four hours.

Parents have branded the trip 'ludicrous' as it emerged the vehicles clock up a staggering 1,000 miles per week transporting food.

'Ludicrous': The meals for Dorset are produced in Nottingham and driven 230 miles to various schools. Each trip costs at least £80 in fuel it has been estimated. The council said the deal was 'value for money'

The company, Cygnet Catering, supplies 118 schools in Dorset with 5,140 meals a day at a cost of up to £2.02 per lunch, which it says includes fuel and transportation costs.

It costs an average small car more than £80 in petrol to do one return journey between Nottingham and Dorset. Over five days this amounts to more than £400 or £12,000 per school year. In a large refrigerated lorry the cost is likely to be considerably more.

Parent groups have have raised concerns about how fresh the food is when t arrives in schools as well as the carbon footprint caused by the lengthy journeys.

Margaret Morrissey, spokeswomen for campaign group Parents Outloud, said: 'It takes at least four hours to do this journey, that’s a long way for food to travel.

'It just seems ludicrous when there are Dorset companies who are able to make excellent school meals that are locally sourced and home cooked.

'I’m not saying this company is not a good one, but a huge amount of fuel is being used and it makes you wonder if the food can be as fresh as if it were prepared locally.

'It’s so important children get a decent, nutritious meal at lunchtime.

'I think parents will think this is ridiculous and I think we need to be asking questions about why we in Dorset, as a rural farming county, are not using local companies.'

Dorset County Council signed a £1.2million a year contract with Cygnet Catering based in Beeston, Nottingham, in 2007, because it was a ‘value for money service’.

The factory prepare the meals on site and it is thought they are then chilled so they can be reheated at schools in areas including Weymouth, Portland, Poole and Bournemouth.

Meals include southern fried chicken pizza, fish fingers, sausage and mash and lasagne.

Some schools have chosen to opt out of the service and are paying an extra eight pence per meal to have it sourced and cooked locally.

One school is Holy Trinity, a Church of England primary school in Weymouth, which has meals delivered from a nearby college for £2.10 each.

Helen Toft, a governor at the school, said: 'For some children the meal they get at lunchtime is the best they will get all day.

'That
is a sad fact, and makes it our responsibility to see that what they 
get in the best we can achieve, and that means good, local food.'

Toni
Coombs, cabinet member for education at Dorset County Council, said: 
'To provide a great value for money service we used a tendering process 
for the contract.

'Cygnet Catering were awarded the contract in 2007 because there was not the capacity locally.

'We did have reservations about the distance the food was being transported.

'Also, Local Food Links, a food supplier based in Bridport, has supplied a number of schools with locally sourced meals.'

Mrs Coombs said the contract with Cygnet is due to run out next July and the council will look to find a more local supplier.

A
spokesman for Cygnet Catering said: 'We have an expert team that 
ensures our distribution network is as efficient as possible, helping us
reduce road miles and provide a high-quality delivery service to 
schools across the country.'
