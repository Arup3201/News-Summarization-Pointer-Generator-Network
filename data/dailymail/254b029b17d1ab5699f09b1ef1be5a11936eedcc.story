Graffiti mocking Hillary Clinton has been plastered across the streets surrounding a restaurant where she is hosting a fundraiser for Democratic Congressional candidates on Monday.

The Tavern Restaurant in Brentwood, LA, is now covered in evil winged monkeys from the Wizard Of Oz.

Instead of carrying the Wicked Witch Of The West, they are holding a sign that reads: 'Hillary 2016'.

It is the latest strike by the anti-Obama artist known  as Sabo, who earlier this year covered Gwyneth Paltrow's Hollywood home in posters featuring her face and the words 'Obama drone' ahead of a fundraiser for the president.

Clinton's $32,400-a-head fundraiser is set to lure influential Hollywood figures including Steven Spielberg and Disney Studios Chairman Alan Horn.

But with just three days to go, the event has been marred by Sabo's mocking posters.

He has also created a fake website for the Tavern which describes its clientele as 'big money, Hollywood Fat Cats', and other Hillary 2016 memorabilia including t-shirts and stickers. 

Anonymous: The artist has spent 15 years creating anti-Democrat graffiti to act as 'the other voice' in LA

Large-scale project: He revealed on his website that he has also made stickers and t-shirts to mock Hillary

Hillary Clinton has not yet confirmed she plans to bid for the Democrat presidential nomination in 2016.

She has lambasted claims that her vocal presence on the mid-terms campaign trail is simply a 'warm-up', insisting she wants the focus to be on next month's candidates.

However, Sabo has taken aim at the former First Lady in an overnight sting.  

This morning, he gleefully tweeted from the account @unsavoryagents: 'SNEAK PEEK - ABOUT LAST NIGHT' with an early morning photograph of one of the monkeys hanging from a lamp post. 

He told The Hollywood Reporter in an email: 'All these leftists, I'm tired of their s***'. 

The website describes Clinton as 'a tired old hag who can't stop wishing she was President'.

For the last 15 years, LA-based Sabo has been creating right-leaning street art to be 'the other voice' in contrast with liberal graffiti artist Shepard Fairey, who designed the 2008 Obama Hope poster.

According to the Unsavory Agents Facebook page, the company’s mission is not only to 'let the art world know that the left-wing will no longer hold art hostage' but to 'get more non-leftists interested and to participate in the arts.'

'Our art is politically minded, right-wing centric, brutal, street level, and hard edge,' the page reads. 'Our means are achieved by any creative means necessary.'

Previous targets have included Jon Stewart, Samuel L. Jackson and Alec Baldwin.
