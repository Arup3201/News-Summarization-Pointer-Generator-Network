Nick Heywood, 45, who acted as a Mr Fix It when an illicit loan was taken out in the name of lottery winner Keith Gough, has been jailed for 12 months

A senior lawyer who was
involved in a callous fraud in which a £9million lottery winner was stripped of his
winnings was behind bars today.

Nick Heywood, 45, acted as a Mr Fix It
when an illicit loan was taken out in the name of Keith Gough - a vulnerable
client who was being swindled by a conman.

Mr Gough, 58, was duped out of £700,000, which he handed over to a fraudster who claimed he was investing in his
business ventures. 

The former baker, who blew most of his fortune on gambling, later drank himself to death after claiming
the lottery win had ruined his life.

Police who investigated the fraud
discovered Heywood, a partner and head of property at Betesh Partnerships in
Manchester, had transferred a £13,750 share of the £225,000 loan to his own
account.

He also tried to block a police
investigation into another client who was convicted of money laundering.

Keith Gough, 58, and his wife Louise, from Bridgenorth, Shropshire, won £9m in a Lotto windfall in 2005. But the couple, who were married for 27 years, separated two years later after Mr Gough quit his job and began drinking heavily

Mr Gough is seen here shortly before his death in 2010 after suffering a heart attack. Heywood had acted for him in the run-up to his death and during the period he was being defrauded by conman James Prince, who persuaded him to invest in bogus business schemes

At Chester Crown Court, Heywood, of High Bank Lane, Bolton, Greater Manchester
pleaded guilty to money laundering, perverting the course of justice and
prejudicing a money laundering investigation.

He was jailed for 12 months
and now faces disciplinary action from the solicitors' regulation authority.

Mr Gough and his wife Louise of Bridgnorth, Shropshire won
£9million in 2005 and splashed out on a top-of-the-range BMW, racehorses and an
executive box at Aston Villa Football Club.

But the couple, who were married for 27
years, separated two years later after Mr Gough quit his job and began drinking heavily out of 'boredom'.

He moved to Cheshire where he rented a
£1million home and hired a chauffeur and a gardener on annual salaries of
£25,000 and £15,000 respectively.

In 2009, James Prince was jailed for three years and four months after he admitted fraud and money laundering

But as well as losing much due to gambling, he was conned out of more than £700,000 by fraudster James Prince, who persuaded him to
invest in bogus business schemes.

He met the conman while he was being
treated for alcohol dependency in the Priory rehabilitation clinic in
Birmingham.

In 2009, Prince was jailed for three years and four months after he
admitted fraud and money laundering.

Mr Gough died in March 2010 after
suffering a heart attack brought on by drinking and stress. He left nearly
£800,000 in his will.

Cheshire Police said Heywood had acted for
Mr Gough in the run-up to his death and during the period he was being defrauded
by Prince.

A spokesman said: 'Sadly Mr Gough had
alcohol-related health problems for quite some time, which along with the fact
he had access to large amounts of money presented him as a vulnerable
person.

'Unfortunately, he died prior to Heywood pleading guilty in this
matter.

'The offence for which Heywood stands convicted relates to a loan made
to Gough [without Gough's knowledge] as a result of Prince's activity. Part of the loan, £13,750, was
transferred by Heywood to himself.'

Heywood was also investigated over his
association with longstanding friend and client Duncan Adamson who was
convicted of money laundering in September 2007.

During this investigation, police sought a
number of conveyancing files from Heywood's law firm but he failed to produce
two key files.

Although he later produced one file, it
was significantly altered.

The second file was hidden until discovered by
police. Adamson, a property developer, is himself currently in custody after
failing to pay a £1.3million confiscation order.

After the case, Det Insp Tim Dean of
Cheshire Police said: 'Heywood abused his trusted position as a solicitor with
the deliberate intent of frustrating a police investigation and justice itself.

'Heywood very nearly succeeded but through
sheer tenacity officers in the case uncovered the truth resulting in his
conviction.

'I cannot think of a more damning
condemnation of a solicitor other than to pervert the course of justice and
launder money.

'His actions have undermined the public
trust in all solicitors. As such I feel sure all solicitors including his old
colleagues would totally condemn his actions.'
