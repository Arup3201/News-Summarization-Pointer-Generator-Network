A Missouri woman collapsed and died on Thursday night just minutes after graduating nursing school, leaving behind a husband and three sons.

Jessica White and her husband, Danny, had taken out loans so that she could pursue her dream of becoming a nurse - and eventually support the family - while he stayed home with their sons.

The entire family was present for Jessica’s pinning ceremony for the National American University nursing school, which she had organized.

Jessica, 32, finally received her associate’s degree in nursing - after 18 months of training - when tragedy struck.

‘She was talking to me, and she said, “I just feel like I have something stuck in my throat that I can’t cough up,”…and then she just fell over,’ said Deborah Wren, one of Jessica’s classmate.

Her devastated husband Danny told FOX8 that his wife suffered from Marfan syndrome – a genetic disorder that affects the body’s connective tissue.

‘It’s just a thinning of the muscular tissue and vascular tissue, and it caused a little heart murmur. We don’t know exactly what caused her to collapse,’ said Danny.

He rode in the ambulance with his wife to the hospital where she passed away.

The couple had been married for 13 years and had three sons Austin, Christian and Hunter.

‘All of a sudden, this catastrophe hits,’ said Danny. ‘You’ve got 1,000 different emotions going through your head, and then my first instinct was to go to my boys and make sure that they’re taken care of.’

They had taken out loans so Danny could stay at home with their three boys as Jessica pursued her dream of becoming a nurse.

The coroner will perform an autopsy to learn more about exactly why Jessica died.

Family and friends are planning a ceremony to release butterflies as a tribute to Jessica because she loved them so much.
