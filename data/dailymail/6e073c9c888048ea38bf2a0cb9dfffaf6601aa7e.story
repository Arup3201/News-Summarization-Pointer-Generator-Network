The distraught family of a war veteran who died after being beaten by a dementia patient on an NHS hospital ward last night branded his death a ‘national disgrace’.

Nurses found Richard Bowman in a pool of blood in the foetal position in bed with massive head, leg and arm injuries.

Despite emergency surgery the 86-year-old died 12 days later.

Last night his family said he should never have been left alone with his attacker, who is also thought to have bipolar disorder.

Richard Bowman, 86, died 12 days after he was found by nurses at West Suffolk Hospital in a pool of blood in the foetal position after being beaten by a dementia patient

‘It is a national disgrace to go to hospital and be beaten to death,’ said his son Charles Hawes, 63.

‘He was laying on his bed getting ready to fall asleep and this chap just came over and started laying into him with a bottle.

‘All we know is Dad put himself in the foetal position to protect himself and his arms, legs and head took the brunt of the attack. The attack was atrocious.

‘We don’t know how long it went on for or how it stopped. He was 86. He was much too weak and elderly to fight back. He couldn’t walk more than ten yards without being out of breath. He couldn’t fight back. What could he do?

‘He had paper thin skin, so when he was battered he was covered in large cuts. There were bad injuries. The police have got the photographs. There was a lot of blood. It’s the last place you’d expect something like that to happen.’

Mr Bowman, a retired businessman who served with the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers, was admitted to West Suffolk Hospital, in Bury St Edmunds, on November 25 with a chest infection.

He had been in and out of hospital over the past few years with repeated chest infections but each time he recovered quickly and was discharged.

Mr Bowman's son, Charles, said his father should never have been left alone with his attacker, who is thought to have bipolar disorder, and says the hospital 'have closed ranks'

Following the attack he had a skin graft and was told he would never walk again. His family questioned the post-mortem examination finding that his death on Saturday was from natural causes.

‘We don’t know for sure if he died because of the beating,’ said Mr Hawes. ‘But I can only say what everyone else is saying – it didn’t help his situation. His body was fighting something else. He had to have surgery on his leg afterwards to repair the damage and needed a skin graft.

'He was much too weak and elderly to fight
 back. He couldn’t walk more than ten yards without being out of breath.
 He couldn’t fight back. What could he do?'

‘If he survived he would have been in a wheelchair.

‘The hospital were in touch with my older brother at first but now they have closed ranks.’

Mr Hawes said he had heard that his father’s attacker was bipolar and should have been under observation.

‘You’d expect staff to have been there at the hospital on the ward,’ he added.

‘Whether they were there witnessing what happened, I don’t know. We can’t get any information.

‘There will have to be an inquiry. How did it happen?’

Mr Bowman, who lived in Exning near Ely, fought for the British Army against Communists in Greece for four years and married a Greek woman, with whom he had his two sons.

After two decades together they divorced and he spent most of the rest of his life with his second partner Jackie.

He ran a number of businesses, including an estate agency in Suffolk, and met the Queen when he was a school governor in North London. His son said: ‘Meeting the Queen was his claim to fame. She opened up his school in North London when he was on the board of governors. They shook hands. He was obviously very proud.’

Suffolk Constabulary said it was not treating Mr Bowman’s death as suspicious. A spokesman added: ‘This matter will now be dealt with by the Coroner.

‘Officers continue to investigate reports of an assault against the deceased man at the hospital on November 25, 2013.’

A spokesman for West Suffolk Hospital said: ‘We would like to take this opportunity to extend our sincere condolences to the patient’s family.

‘We are taking this incident extremely seriously and are carrying out a full internal investigation, as well as assisting the police.’

In 2002, a grandmother dying of cancer was raped in a toilet cubicle in a London hospital.

The attack occurred on a ward shared with men and reignited anger over the Labour Party’s failure to deliver on its promises to get rid of mixed sex wards.

The frail 71-year-old was attacked in a toilet cubicle at King’s College Hospital, South London.

She told police that her assailant struck after she had got up to go to the toilet.
