Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal has urged his team to focus on maintaining intensity for the full 90 minutes.

Van Gaal is convinced United will start delivering results on a consistent basis if they can avoid tailing off in the latter stages of matches.

United have assembled a formidable-looking attacking side but their defence has made them look vulnerable in the opening two months of the campaign.

Victories over West Ham and Everton in their last two matches have eased some of the concern after a series of indifferent results, but they were left clinging to 2-1 scorelines on both occasions.

Van Gaal said: 'When you see a match, when a trainer or coach is honest, you see his team is not playing 90 minutes at the highest level. So, that is not so difficult to feel and analyse, but to improve it is much more difficult. That is what we are looking for.

'The players are willing to do everything and we saw that in the matches against West Ham and Everton, but you have to do it in the right way.

'To kill a game, for example, you need a lot of discipline, and discipline together - not with three players or eight players, but with 11 players. That is the most difficult thing and we can do that, but that needs time.'

United are lifted ahead of Monday's trip to West Brom by the possible return of a number of players from injury.

Ander Herrera, Chris Smalling, Ashley Young, Phil Jones and Michael Carrick have all recently returned to training and could be in contention if they can prove match-fitness.

Defenders Jonny Evans and Paddy McNair and midfielders Jesse Lingard and Antonio Valencia are still sidelined while captain Wayne Rooney is suspended.Â
