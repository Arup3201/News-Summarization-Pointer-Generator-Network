Donna Tithecott, 54, stole  £55,000 in benefits after failing to tell authorities about Spanish properties

A woman who stole more than £55,000 in benefits by hiding her Spanish property empire has walked free from court.

Donna Tithecott, 54, from Lifton in Devon failed to tell the authorities she part-owned three properties in Spain whilst claiming for housing benefit, council tax and income support.

And it is expected her debts will take ‘130 years to repay’ after she was set a payment rate of £2.50 a week to the Department of Work and Pensions and £5 a week to Torridge Council.

She was found guilty of all seven charges of failing to notify changes in her circumstances and dishonest representation when she appeared at Exeter Crown Court today.

Despite that Judge Graham Cottle told her she would not have to serve an immediate prison sentence.

The court heard that the properties were bought by her ex-husband –who she never lived with - using money he had borrowed from her.

Defence lawyer Paul Grumbar said that Tithecott did not benefit from these deals and did not put any money in or take anything out of them.

However her name was on the deeds for ‘a rather ordinary house’ and two barns in Spain.

He agreed with the judge that it was ‘an odd case’ and said benefit fraud is normally committed by people who ‘want to enrich themselves, have a bit of luxury and a nestegg’ but Tithecott, who lives in Broadwoodwidger, Torridge, was not in these categories.

Judge Cottle said she had been married for ‘only five minutes’ and her husband had worked and lived abroad almost all the time’.

Speaking of the Spanish property he said: ‘You paid nothing towards it and took nothing from it.’

He was told she was in ‘very poor health’ and had just £40 a month to live on and her financial state was ‘dire’.

He jailed her for nine months, suspended for two years saying it was a ‘very odd and unusual case’.

The court heard the Spanish house was bought in 2004 for almost £36,000 or 45,500 euros and in 2012 was worth £94,500 (111,000 euros). The two barns were derelict and of nominal value.

However the judge said to confiscate money from Spain would be complicated.

It is expected Tithecott's debts will take ‘130 years to repay’ after she was set a payment rate of £2.50 a week to the Department of Work and Pensions and £5 a week to Torridge Council (pictured with Ford KA convertible)
