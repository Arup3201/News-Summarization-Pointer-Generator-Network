The backlog of passport applications threatening to ruin thousands of family holidays this summer almost doubled in just three months this year, MPs heard today.

Passport Office chief Paul Pugh admitted 480,000 people are now waiting for their travel documents - some 200,000 higher than last year. Mr Pugh, who revealed he earns £104,000 a year, blamed a 'substantially higher intake' of applications.

But unions told MPs the figure was even higher. By June 8 the number of people waiting for their passport had hit 493,289, union chief Mike Jones told the Home Affairs Select Committee. Just 12 weeks earlier, the figure stood at 289,892.

Mr Jones, whose PCS union represents Passport Office staff, told MPs: 'They've lost control of the backlog.'

Passport Office chief Paul Pugh, who earns £104,000 a year, told MPs the backlog had hit 480,000 - around 200,000 higher than usual

Mr Pugh admitted that he considered resigning over the fiasco. He said: 'Of course I've considered whether it would be right for me to have stepped down.'

Mike Jones, the Home Office group secretary of the Public and Commercial Services Union representing Passport Office staff, appeared before MPs on the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee this afternoon 

Home Affairs Select Committee chairman Keith Vaz questioned the PCS's Mike Jones this afternoon as part of his investigation into the passport crisis

But when asked whether he would rule out taking Passport Office staff on strike during the crisis, Mr Jones refused, adding: 'We are keeping all of our options open.'

He said he wanted the 550 jobs cut since 2010 reinstated and a 'guarantee' of no more privatisation. He added: 'We've got a crisis caused by a lack of jobs.'

Passport chief Paul Pugh said any strike action would be 'extremely damaging'.

He told MPs that even before strike action there had 'never been a challenging situation of this kind' in recent years.

Mr Pugh apologised to families who suffered delays in their passport applications.

Addressing Mr Pugh, the committee chairman Keith Vaz said: 'Would you like to take this opportunity to apologise to all those who have been waiting? I have a sheaf of letters from members of the public, from members of parliament, who are very, very angry.

'You don't seem to recognise the fact that people are very upset and angry. Would you like to apologise?'

Mr Pugh replied: 'I absolutely recognise the anger and distress that some people have suffered and I would like to put on record that yes, in every case where we haven't met our service standards, where we haven't been able to meet the customer's needs, yes, certainly, we are sorry for that.' 

The Prime Minister last week apologised for the chaos after he revealed  there were at least 30,000 applications outstanding which had not been processed within the normal three-week limit.

But it now emerges that his only accounts for a fraction of the true backlog.

Amid mounting fury over the passport delays the Government was forced to take urgent action to deal with the crisis.

Those who desperately need travel documents were told that they could get their applications fast-tracked free of charge, instead of paying an extra £55.50 a person. 

But this will only apply to those who have not had their passports back within three weeks and are going abroad in the next seven days.

Minister also announced that those renewing their UK passports from overseas will be given an automatic 12-month extension. And families applying from abroad for passports on behalf of their children will be given emergency travel documents as well, the Home Secretary announced.

Pictures leaked to MailOnline, showing hundreds of boxes of applications piled on the floor of a Passport Office in Liverpool, piled pressure on the Government to introduce emergency measures to tackle the backlog

The images showed boxes of applications piled in a spare room set aside for interviews. Officials at the Liverpool clearing house where the image was taken said the situation was 'a million times worse' in Durham

Standard passports cost £72.50 - or £46 for children - and should only take three weeks to get.

Those needing a passport urgently can pay extra for a premium or fast-track service.

The 'premium' service, costing £128, means passports can be collected within four hours of being approved.

Under the fast-track service, costing £103, a passport is returned within a week of the application being approved.

The Home Office has urged those who have already applied not to resubmit their application.

But those that need to leave the country within the next seven days and have been waiting for their passport for more than three weeks can have their application fast tracked for free.

British families abroad can get an automatic 12 months extension - while their children will be given emergency travel documents.

The Passport Office has increased the number of examiners and call centre staff by a further 200 on top of the 1,000 staff already redeployed to deal with a surge in applications running at a 12-year high.

Mrs May has drafted in emergency staff - earning up £70 an hour - to the Passport Office to clear the backlog.

Around 100 Home Office staff based in the North have been asked to move to the Liverpool Passport Office for up to two months, a letter leaked to MailOnline revealed.

This is on top of the 250 backroom staff at the Passport Office which have already been redeployed to the front line.

The Government's attempt to head off the growing crisis came after MailOnline published pictures showing hundreds of boxes of passport applications piled on a sorting office floor.

Last week passport office workers revealed the pressure they were being put under to clear the backlog.

One whistleblower said workers were being left 'suicidal'. He said Mrs May did not have 'any idea' how bad the situation really was and claimed staff were at breaking point.

Speaking anonymously, he said he had been working seven days a week for four months to clear the estimated 500,0000 backlog of applications.

He said: 'We're tired, we can't concentrate. Theresa May hasn't got any idea. She doesn't now how bad things are.'

As the Government moved to avert a summer holiday crisis, hundreds of families last week descended on offices - like this one in London - to renew their passport in person

The whistleblower was asked about the morale at the Passport Office. The worker said: 'It's suicidal. Suicidal. The staff are worn out.

'Management keep changing the goal posts. They come up with crazy ideas and say how can we help, but they don't have a clue.

'The overnight staff are only supposed to work until 9pm, but they are working till midnight. I'm just so tired.

'I just want people to know the truth. I'm worn out, really worn out and it's been going on for far too long.'

He added that the Passport Office in Durham was 'a million times worse' than in Liverpool. He added: 'It's really bad - they are way behind.'

The worker said that yesterday morning a woman 'burst into tears because of the pressure they're putting on us'. 

Theresa May ordered hundreds of staff to move from UK Visas & Immigration to the Passport Office, as this leaked letter to MailOnline revealed, to help clear the backlog. But unions said the move would leave other areas short staffed

Last night a spokesman for Her Majesty’s Passport Office said: 'There are currently approximately 480,000 active applications being processed.

'It is not unusual during peak periods for HMPO to operate with high numbers of applications in the system at any one time, with this year seeing the highest levels for 12 years.

'We are working to ensure that the vast majority of people continue to receive their passports within our service standards.

'We have also introduced a range of measures to help those who need to travel urgently, including free upgrades.'
