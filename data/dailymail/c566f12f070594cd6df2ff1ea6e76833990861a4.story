He likes to wander through fences, bond with neighborhood children and nuzzle his owner - but he is no ordinary household pet.

Red the Longhorn is a 600-pound steer, thick as a barrel and with horns stretching more than six feet from end to end.

But that hasn't stopped the mischievous longhorn from endearing himself to two families in Helotes Hill Country, Texas.

'He's just an oversized dog with horns,' Red's owner, 49-year-old Pat Langlinais, said. 'He likes to lick your hand. He's pretty gentle.'

Fine animal: Red the Longhorn's horns are more than six feet long, tip to tip, and he weighs more than 600 pounds

Doesn't like to be fenced in: Red the Longhorn has been known to jump over fences to get close to his human family

Houston Chronicle reported Red spends much of his day wandering between Langlinais' ranch and the nearby property of the Moore family.

He's photobombed a family portrait, drunk water from their swimming pool and 
 twisted his horns to get through a walk-in garage door.

Mom-of-three Denise Moore, a home school teacher, said Red also appreciates story-telling.

While reading Mary Shelley's 'Frankenstein' to her son in 
their barn, the longhorn watched them, mesmerized, for a long time.

Curious: Denise Moore said she was reading a children's book to her child when Red the Longhorn walked over and stared keenly at the book

Close bond: Red the 600-pound longhorn has become a household pet like a cat or dog

It inspired Moore to write a children's book about the friendly steer. Now she's looking for a publisher.

And it will be quite a tale.

Red doesn't like to be fenced in, once jumping a five-foot fence and slipping beneath chains to be close to his human family.

'Feed him 
the good stuff, feed him first and you won't have any problems,' Moore 
said. 'And the only way to get him to go is if he wants to go.'

One of the family: Neighborhood children like to have fun with red, including by sticking pictures to his head between his horns

Like family: Red might be a massive longhorn, but he has become a treasured member of two Texas families

Just another household pet: Red the Longhorn has been following around members of the Moore family since he was a calf. They treat him like their pet
