A post office thief who stole the shop's takings to sail the world on luxury cruises while her best friend the postmistress fed her family on mouldy bread has been spared jail. 

Mother-of-four Diane Lathlean, 50, was convicted of stealing £3,050 of stock from the post office in Ampleforth, North Yorkshire where she worked as a part-time shelf stacker and counter assistant.

She enjoyed cruises around Hawaii and the Bahamas, while her unsuspecting boss, and friend Fiona Senior, 48, was forced to sacrifice her own pay to keep the retail side of the business afloat.

Magistrates found Lathlean guilty of stealing the stock between 2008 and 2012 in December, but sent the case to Crown Court as they did not feel the maximum six month prison sentence they could impose would be sufficient.

However, she was given a suspended six month sentence when she appeared before York Crown Court on Friday.

Mrs Senior and her husband Paul, 45, had already received a £28,000 settlement for alleged theft of money and goods by Lathlean in a civil case prior to her trial.

The couple had employed Lathlean to work 14 and a half hours a week, and paid her £6.10 an hour. 

But while she cruised around the Mediterranean, and spent Christmas in California, they lived off mouldy bread and Mrs Senior gave up her salary in a bid to keep the business going.

Lathlean also enjoyed regular beauty treatments and was a Tottenham Hotspur season ticket holder, travelling all over the country staying in hotels, her victims said. 

Mrs Senior had refused to believe her best friend was to blame as the post office and village shop teetered on the brink of ruin.

But Mr Senior became suspicious when 'appalling' takings suddenly flourished after Lathlean went on a three-week voyage to Panama.

Meanwhile, they collected coupons towards a cheap break at Haven’s Haggerston Castle Caravan Park in Northumberland. 

'She was systematically stealing from our business while keeping a smile on her face,' Mrs Senior told the judge at York Crown Court.

'I totally trusted her. I thought she was my best friend in the village. Little did I realise her hidden agenda.'

Mr Senior had told the original trial that he and his wife had 'inherited' Lathlean when they took over the post office and shop in 2008.

Lathlean was handed a six month jail sentence, suspended for two years, and ordered to carry out 140 hours of unpaid work

She had worked in the shop under the store’s previous owners - who had also struggled to make ends meet, he added.

The court heard that Lathlean knew most of the people in the small village and had served them for more than 20 years.

By 2012, local businesses - seeing the store was getting run down - clubbed together to pay for a refurbishment, which included CCTV.

When Mr Senior checked the footage, he was amazed to see Lathlean wandering around the empty shop slipping all manner of goods in her bag or dropping them into a drawer to retrieve later.

Mr Senior told the court he believed the true loss was more like £50,000, and he had long suspected his employee had been stealing.

He added: 'It stuck out a lot more when Diane was on holiday. We could afford to pay our bills when she was on holiday.

'I suspected after a while there was something wrong. But because Diane was Fiona’s best friend she just would not hear of it.'

Julian Tanikal, mitigating for Lathlean, of Geldgate, Ampleforth, claimed the cruises were funded by her husband Simon who worked for American Express.

Scarborough Magistrates' Court could have jailed Lathlean for six months but presiding magistrate Carl Harwood had said: 'The offence is so serious you need greater punishment than we can give you.

'You were entrusted to run the business while the owners were away. We cannot see there would be any higher degree of trust.'

The Seniors were stunned when the judge at Crown Court gave Lathlean a six month jail sentence suspended for two years.

She was also ordered to carry out 140 hours of unpaid work, pay £300 court costs and an £80 surcharge.

Lathlean, who has already repaid the Seniors £3,050 for the stock, showed no emotion when sentence was passed.

The court was told she has a previous criminal record for theft from an employer in 1989.

After the sentence, Mrs Senior stormed that it 'made a mockery' of the magistrates' decision.

'I do feel that this was an extremely light sentence bearing in mind it is not the first conviction for theft from an employer,' she said after the hearing.

'However, the justice system is the law of the land and we have to abide by this.

'Both the civil case settlement and the guilty verdict can now give us closure on the matter.

'From the bottom of our hearts, we would also like to thank the local community for their tremendous support.'

The couple have a disabled daughter, Eleanor, 13, who suffers from the rare genetic disorder Prader-Willi syndrome, and another daughter Jennifer, 11.

Mrs Senior added: 'We were eating mouldy bread and buying second hand Christmas presents from charity shops.

'I was devastated when I found out what Diane had been doing. She was my best friend, and the best friend of the people who had the shop before us.

'I just sank and went to bed for four days. Now I don’t even want to be in the same room as her.'

Mr Senior said: 'I don’t know why she got such a light sentence. We are just glad it’s over because it’s been a very stressful time.

'The business is thriving now and all the problems it had are over. The customers are disgusted at what Lathlean did.

'Most are just happy their village post office and shop are still here. They nearly went to the wall. At least we can move on now.

'She went on at least ten cruises while we were on the rocks.

'At one stage we were only a week from going under and I had to take a second job as a chimney sweep to prop the business up.

'We put £43,000 into the business while we lived like paupers and she was cruising the world.'
