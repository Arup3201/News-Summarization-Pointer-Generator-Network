The online auction site eBay shaved almost £50million from its corporation tax bill in Britain by legally channelling payments through Luxembourg and Switzerland, it has emerged.

The U.S. firm paid just a little over £1million in tax in Britain - despite generating sales of almost £800million in this country.

Meanwhile Swedish furniture firm Ikea cut its UK tax bill by half by siphoning off profits overseas in the form of royalty payments to a sister company, it has been found.

Headquarters: eBAY has said its European arm complies fully with all applicable tax laws and regimes

The news comes after it emerged coffee giant Starbucks has paid no tax in the UK in the past three years.

The coffee chain has used loopholes in order to pay just £8.6million in tax in 14 years of trading in Britain - during which time it has raked in over £3billion in revenues.

Foreign firms' use of savvy accounting techniques to legally avoid paying tax in Britain has provoked fury among politicians and consumers.

eBay, the world's largest online marketplace, is structured in a way that allows it to dramatically reduce its UK tax liability.

Furniture giant Ikea paid £8.1million in corporation tax on sales of almost £1.2billion and profits of £23.6million

According to an investigation by The Sunday Times, using a group-wide profit margin of 23 per cent, eBay's UK profits would have been £181million in 2010. At the time this would have resulted in a corporation tax bill of £51million.

But the total amount of tax paid by the firm's four main UK-based subsidiaries for that year was £1.2million.

This is partially down to the fact 
that fees stumped up by eBay sellers in Britain are handed over to a 
related company in Luxembourg called PayPal (Europe) Sarl, meaning most 
sales are channelled through a tax haven.

Other U.S. firms including Facebook and Google are known to use similarly complex methods of moving money out of Britain and into countries with lower tax rates.

Furniture chain Ikea paid £8.1million corporation tax in the year to August 2011, on sales of almost £1.2billion and profits of £23.6million.

The investigation found the firm uses a legal accounting trick to lower profits in Britain, by way of paying a three per cent 'franchise fee' to a separate company based in Holland.

The fee covers the right to use Ikea's furniture designs and its trademark.

In 2010-11 Ikea's profits in Britain were reduced by £35.7million by the fee, meaning the exchequer did not receive £9.7million in corporation tax it otherwise would have from Ikea's UK subsidiary.

The fee was paid to Inter Ikea Systems BV in Holland, which is controlled by another firm based in tax haven Liechtenstein.

The Public Accounts Committee are set to question the head of HM Revenue & Customs over the kinds of methods being used by foreign firms to legally avoid paying UK tax at a parliamentary hearing next month.

Starbucks - the second largest restaurant or cafe chain in the world after McDonald's - has recorded losses in Britain while telling investors the UK market is profitable.

It is now facing a backlash after thousands of outraged customers pledged to boycott its branches after learning of the host of complicated measures Starbucks employs to legally avoid paying tax in Britain.

A spokesman for eBay said:
 'eBay Inc in Europe works with tax authorities and complies fully with 
all applicable tax laws and regimes - including national and 
internationally recognised rules.'

An Ikea spokesman told the Sunday Times: 'There is a 3% franchise fee on Ikea sales worldwide. Tax authorities in the Netherlands have consistently confirmed that Inter Ikea Systems BV is the beneficial owner of the Ikea retail system and the franchise fee income.'

Boycott: Thousands of customers have pledged to stop visiting Starbucks after it emerged the chain has not paid corporation tax in Britain in three years

Starbucks, which has to pay VAT on in-store hot drinks, has said it continues to pay its 'fair share' in taxes in full compliance with all UK tax laws.

'There has been no suggestion by any authority that we are anything but compliant and good tax payers,' the chain has said.
