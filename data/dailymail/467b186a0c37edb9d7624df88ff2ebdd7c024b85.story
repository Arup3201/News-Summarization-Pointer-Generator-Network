An elderly woman claims half her rectum was removed after a hospital mix up meant doctors misdiagnosed her with an aggressive form of cancer.

The 68-year-old woman from Orlando in Florida, U.S, filed a lawsuit against the hospital on Tuesday demanding answers over the alleged mistake.

She was led to believe she was dying of cancer for months after doctors told her she was suffering rectal cancer. 

They made the diagnosis after taking tissue samples from the woman during a colonoscopy - a procedure where a camera is used to investigate the bowel.

But the 68-year-old, who asked not to be named, claims she was misdiagnosed, after her test results were mixed up with those of a man who had cancer.

The diagnosis came as a shock because she had been in good health before, exercising regularly and taking no medication, she said.

‘I literally had my daughter drive down for Minnesota for Christmas because we all thought this was probably the last Christmas we would have together.’ she told the Orlando Sentinel.

She said she felt there was a problem with the diagnosis, so she asked the hospital to double-check the labwork after further tests and biopsies to pinpoint the cancer’s location kept coming back negative.

But doctors chose to go through with the operation, so in January she underwent surgery at Florida Hospital to have part of her rectum removed.

After the operation, she was overjoyed to hear that lab work on the tissue the surgeon removed found it to be cancer-free.

Her doctor called in May, and told her that DNA testing confirmed there had never been any cancer, she said.

‘I was euphoric. I felt like a big, heavy shroud had been taken away from me,’ she said.

She said during a meeting with hospital managers they apologised to her.

‘They were all very sorry. They said it over and over and over,’ she said.

But the hospital did not provide detailed records documenting the mix up and the steps it took to determine she was cancer- free.

As part of the lawsuit she has asked that a judge order the hospital to release all of the woman's medical records documenting the error. 

It also asks the judge to appoint a special master to handle the records.

If the hospital is found to have violated federal and state laws, she will be able to sue for medical negligence.

Florida Hospital spokesperson Samantha Kearns Olenick said she would not comment on the pending litigation.
