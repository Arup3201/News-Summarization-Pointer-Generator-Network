Sunderland have expressed an interest in signing Crystal Palace goalkeeper Julian Speroni.

The Argentinian is a free agent despite Palace holding initial talks over extending his contract.

Gus Poyet is interested in Speroni having lost Keiren Westwood and Oscar Ustari, who is looking to return to football in Spain.

Uncertain future: Julian Speroni's contract is due to expire next month

Stalwart: Speroni has played almost 350 times for Palace since his switch from Dundee in 2004

The 35-year-old was an almost ever-present between the sticks this season for Palace, making 39 appearances as the Eagles defied the odds to beat the drop under Tony Pulis.

Speroni has played 349 times for the south London side since his Â£500,000 switch to Selhurst Park from Dundee in 2004.

Meanwhile, Sevilla are keen on Sunderland midfielder Alfred Nâ€™Diaye.

The Senegal international midfielder has been deemed surplus to requirements on Wearside.
