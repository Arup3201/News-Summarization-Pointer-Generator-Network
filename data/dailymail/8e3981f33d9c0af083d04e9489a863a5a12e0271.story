Questions about Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos' health have been raised after he appeared to wet himself during an election speech.

The 62-year-old was giving a talk to supporters in the coastal city of Barranquilla when a dark patch appeared across the politician's beige trousers.

Santos, who underwent surgery for prostate cancer in 2012, did not stop the speech.
