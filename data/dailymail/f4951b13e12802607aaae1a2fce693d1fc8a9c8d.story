Shocking footage has emerged of the moment a police officer is seen forcefully throwing a teenage girl to the ground.

Senior Constable Steven Trewin has been charged assaulting with Cassandra Swann, who was 19 at the time of the incident, the ABC reported.

In the video, a blonde woman is seen hitting a police officer in the neck with her hand.

The officer then grabs the woman by the arm and forces her to the ground in one rapid motion.

Trewin told a court in Perth, Western Australia he was trying to stop the woman from hitting him.

The incident was caught on CCTV inside the Northbridge police complex on August 25, 2013.

Ms Swann and her friends had come to the station to report they had been attacked by some men while they were leaving a nightclub.

The police officer said Ms Swann was swearing it at him and he had to arrest her for her disorderly conduct

She was drunk at the time Trewin allegedly assaulted her and had been swearing at him.

He then arrested Ms Swann when she did not leave and did not stop throwing profanities at him.

Trewin told the court while he was taking her into custody she hit in the face twice with what he believed to be a blunt object.

'I then transferred to the arm bar [arrest technique] to force her down to the floor,' he said.

The woman is then forcefully thrown to the ground by the officer. The magistrate will make a decision about the case

'My intention was to stop her striking me. I intended to force her to the ground, not to throw her to the ground.'

While he was questioned about his behaviour by the prosecution, Trewin said he thought he followed the proper procedure to arrest Ms Swann.

The magistrate residing over the matter will make a decision about the case later this month.
