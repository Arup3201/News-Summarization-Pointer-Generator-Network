Mary Brown, of New Mexico, says her special-needs daughter has been trying to wipe out her family with poison, but when she sought treatment for the disturbed teen, the mother was charged with child abuse.

Brown, a mother of two from Hobbs, says her 15-year-old daughter, Katie, laced food and drinks with toxic cleaning products on three separate occasions this year, causing severe damage to her sister's vocal chords.

When Katie Brown was born, she suffered a brain hemorrhage that resulted in cerebral palsy - a condition that causes movement problems and a host of disabilities.

Dangerous mind: Katie Brown, 15, who suffers from cerebral palsy, has allegedly poisoned her family three times 

Victim: Katie's mother, Mary Brown, said her special-needs daughter got mad at her in March for making her do chores and laced her iced tea with Lysol 

Weapons of choice: In June, Katie poured bleach in her mother's Coke, and in August she sprayed a carpet cleaner on a tray of cornbread 

'She just has outbursts, and we never know when they're coming,' Mary Brown told the station KOB4.

For Brown and her family, things took a dangerous turn in March when Katie poured Lysol cleaning liquid in her mother's iced tea as payback for making her do house chores.

Brown drove her daughter to a hospital for psychiatric treatment, but the 15-year-old was released.

Three months later, the mentally unstable girl spiked her mother's Coca Cola with bleach, but once again the hospital let her return home after a brief stay.

Then in August Katie sprayed toxic carpet cleaner on cornbread.

'She started laughing and said I put rat poison on it,' Brown recalled.  

In harm's way: Katie's sister, Kaylee, pictured left and right, and Mary Brown's boyfriend, Eugene Fraust (right), ate the tainted cornbread and suffered damage to their vocal chords 

Kaylee Brown was forced to leave her high school choir after the August poisoning 

Brown's other daughter, Kaylee, and her boyfriend who ate some of the tainted food suffered damage to their vocal chords.

Katie's sister was even forced to leave her high school choir because she lost her ability to sing.

Brown's boyfriend, Eugene Fraust, said he was told by his doctor that another such poisoning could prove fatal for him.

Fearing for the lives of her loved ones, Brown once again took Katie to a hospital, but this time she would not let her come home until she received help.

Desperate measure: Brown was charged with child abuse after taking Katie to the hospital for treatment and not allowing her to return home 

As a result of her actions, the mother of two has been charged with child abuse and the 15-year-old has been taken into state custody.

But Mary Brown says her daughter belongs in a mental hospital, where she could receive the care and treatment she needs.

‘I love my daughter, and all I want for her is to get the help she needs,’ said Brown.
