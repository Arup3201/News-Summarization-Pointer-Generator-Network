The Duke of Cambridge has cancelled his appearance at a series of events in the north east of England to attend the funeral of his former nanny.

Olga Powell cared for William and Prince Harry when they were young boys including the difficult period when their parents' marriage was breaking up in the early 1990s.

William will be attending the funeral on Wednesday in a private capacity and it is thought he will be passing on the condolences of his brother Harry who is serving in Afghanistan as an Apache helicopter co-pilot gunner.

Mrs Powell, who was in her 80s and lived in Broxbourne, Hertfordshire, died last month after suffering a heart attack and worked as a royal nanny from the 1980s until the early 1990s.

During an interview she gave last year before William's wedding she said: 'I have a very normal relationship with them.

'Their upbringing was very normal and their parents wanted them to have as ordinary a childhood as they could.

'If they saw a muddy puddle they wanted to jump in it and if there was something to climb, they wanted to climb it.'

A St James's Palace spokesman said: 'Given the significant role that Mrs Powell played in the Princes' lives, the Duke wished to pay his respects in person.'

The former nanny remained in touch with the royal brothers and was reportedly invited to a number of major events in their lives including the royal wedding and William's passing-out parade at Sandhurst in 2006.

Kate will now carry out a series of events in Newcastle and Stockton-on-Tees on her own on Wednesday, including meeting community groups at Newcastle Civic Centre and elsewhere chatting to organisations which have benefited from the Royal Wedding Charitable Gift Fund or have the Duchess as a patron.

Today, the Duke and Duchess will open the Football Association's new national training complex.

William and Kate will be given a tour of the £100million St George's Park site in Staffordshire which aims to be a centre of excellence for training football coaches.

The royal couple will step on to a practice pitch to meet England manager Roy Hodgson and his squad who are preparing for their 2014 World Cup qualifier against San Marino on Friday.

Hope Powell, England women's national coach, and a number of players from the England women's team will also meet the Duke - the FA's president - and his wife during their tour.

David Bernstein, FA chairman, said: 'The opening of St George's Park is truly a momentous occasion in the history of the FA.

'Next year we will celebrate the FA's 150th anniversary, and this moment will be recorded as significant as any that has gone before us in the last 149 years.

'We are particularly delighted that both the Duke and Duchess can join us to open this facility.'

David Sheepshanks, chairman of St George's Park, said: 'This is a wonderful reward for all of the people that have worked so hard to bring St George's Park to reality.

'The local community have embraced every aspect of St George's Park and this will be a red letter day for Burton upon Trent and the surrounding locality.'

The national football centre aims to produce better coaches and in turn better players - and ultimately a new England manager - as it attempts to replicate the success of world and European champions Spain.

The facility covers 330 acres and has 11 external pitches, a dedicated practice and training area for goalkeepers and sports pavilions for post-training debriefs.

It also has a world-class sports and exercise medicine, human performance and research centre.
