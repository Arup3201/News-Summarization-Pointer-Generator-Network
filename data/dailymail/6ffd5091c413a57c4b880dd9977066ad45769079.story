A young woman who thought she was suffering from sinus problems has been diagnosed with a  terminal brain tumour.

Leighanne Easton, 26, was given the devastating news she has just months to live after falling ill earlier this year.

She has now created a bucket list of all the things she wants to do before she dies - including driving a tractor and trying on a wedding dress.

Ms Easton, a hairdresser, went to her doctor after suffering from migraines, which became increasingly severe in February.

But it took a few months for doctors to diagnose her condition because it is so rare.

They initially thought that Ms Easton had sinus problems but she began to suffer from double vision and started being sick at work.

When she was sent to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary in July, a scan revealed that she has glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), an aggressive brain tumour.

She said: 'The doctor told me I had a brain tumour. I actually laughed and said, 'what, you're telling me you've found a brain?",' said Ms Easton, of Premnay, near Insch, in Aberdeenshire.

A week later she underwent nine hours of surgery. 'I can't fault the care and speed that they treated me,’ she added.

Ms Easton, a hairdresser, went to her doctor after suffering from migraines, which became increasingly severe in February. But scans this summer revealed she has glioblastoma multiforme, an aggressive brain tumour

After surgery, Ms Easton underwent radiotherapy and chemotherapy and was initially told she may have four years to live

Ms Easton then underwent
 radiotherapy and chemotherapy treatments at Edinburgh's Western General
 and was initially told she may have four years to live.

But a further scan showed that the tumour behind her right eye had started to grow back and had spread to her left eye and brain stem.

Her mother Gail, of Kennethmont, in Aberdeenshire, said: ‘We asked how much time she had left and we were told we were talking months, not years. They told us a year would be quite a high target to meet.

‘On our way home she started making a bucket list. Suddenly it became a case of doing everything while she was still up to it.’

Ms Easton's friends are raising money to pay for her chosen activities and are selling £2.50 pairs of underwear with the slogan ‘Cancer is Pants'.

As well as undergoing headshaves to raise money for charity, her friends redecorated Ms Easton’s home while she was in hospital getting treatment.

So far she has enjoyed a trip to Liverpool to see Mrs Brown's Boys, the Blackpool illuminations and has had an exclusive behind the scenes tour of Murrayfield stadium.

She still wants to drive a tractor, go sledging behind a quad bike and take a trip to County Durham to visit the Beamish Museum, which was one of her favourite childhood attractions.

However, Ms Easton’s bucket list also includes more serious items, such as organising her own funeral because she doesn’t want her parents to pay for it.  She has even met an undertaker to discuss coffins.

Her mother has now moved into her daughter’s house, leaving her husband John and son Andrew, 29, at home. 

Mrs Easton said: ‘There has been so much fundraising going on to make sure Leighanne could do everything on her list.

But tests then revealed the cancer was terminal and she had just months to live, inspiring her to write a bucket list. Ms Easton is pictuired with Scottish International rugby star Max Evans and tour guide Debbie Watt

She also managed to tick another wish off the list by meeting with  TV's 'Mrs Brown'

‘Everyone has supported her from day one.

‘When we were in Edinburgh getting treatment, her friends came in and decorated her living room and kitchen and put laminate flooring down. 

‘It's amazing how many people are desperate to do things to help. We just can't thank people enough.’
