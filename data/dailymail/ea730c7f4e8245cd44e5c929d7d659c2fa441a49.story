Shamed former IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn has celebrated his six million dollar pay-off to a hotel maid who accused him of trying to rape her - by cavorting with three blonde models at a Paris nightclub.

The disgraced 64-year-old economist was caught on camera brazenly posing with the attractive young women during a night out with pals in the French capital.

Strauss-Kahn hit the town with five friends on Saturday after reaching the £3.8 million deal with New York hotel cleaner Nafissatou Diallo to settle her civil action for sexual assault.

They are both expected to appear before a judge in the Bronx on December 7 to sign the papers that will end all legal action against him in the US.

But the cash-strapped Frenchman is so hard up he may have to borrow half the money from his multi-millionaire estranged wife, French daily Le Monde said.

Accuser: Nafissatou Diallo maintained her claims the she was the victim of a 'violent, sadistic attack,' despite criminal charges being dropped

Meanwhile in France, Strauss-Kahn - a self-confessed sex addict - is also waiting to learn if he will face charges of conspiring with pimps to procure girls for sex parties around the world.

A judge in Lille will rule on December 19 whether he should stand trial over the accusations.

Strauss-Kahn - once tipped as a future president of France - seemed unworried by his ongoing legal woes as he relaxed at the chic Le Matignon night spot.

He and his friends mingled with models, who were at the club to promote a new ready-made cocktail called Sex on the Beach.

A reveller at the club told France’s Europe 1 radio: 'Strauss-Kahn arrived at the club at about 10.30pm with five or six other men and two bodyguards.

'They sat at a table in the VIP area before going down to the nightclub floor itself.'

Jean-Albert Vergnaud, boss of the Sex on the Beach drinks company, added: 'Mr Strauss-Kahn seemed to love our brand, and happily posed for pictures.

'Despite what some people have said, these photos are not faked and he was genuinely there that evening enjoying himself.

'It was a bit of a marketing coup for us too.'

Strauss-Kahn has been embroiled in a catalogue of sex scandals since being arrested in May 2011 for trying to rape Guinea immigrant Miss Diallo, 29, when she came to clean his suite in New York’s Sofitel hotel.

He was charged with attempted rape, sexual abuse, a criminal sexual act, unlawful imprisonment and forcible touching and held at the city’s notorious Ryker’s Island prison.

He claimed Ms Diallo had consented to sex but later described the encounter as ‘a moral failure’ that he would regret his whole life.

All charges were then dropped a month later over concerns about the cleaner’s credibility.

She went on to file a civil case against him for what she called a ‘violent and sadistic attack’ that humiliated and degraded her, and ‘robbed her of her dignity as a woman’.

Loan: 
With no income or savings, Strauss-Kahn may have to ask 
multi-millionaire heiress Anne Sinclair, his 63-year-old wife who left 
him in the summer, for half of the money

Miss Sinclair, also 63, a heiress and
former television presenter who now runs a Paris website, originally 
put up a £624,000 deposit and £3.1million bond to get Strauss-Kahn out 
of the notorious Rikers Island prison in May 2011 after his arrest at 
the Sofitel hotel in Manhattan.

At the time, she insisted her husband was innocent, but the couple who have a daughter Camille, and had been married for 20 years, split 
up in the summer.

Strauss-Kahn also faces legal woes in France, where he returned after criminal charges were dropped, only to face similar accusations of sexually abusing a young French writer.

When those allegations were also abandoned, he was then confronted with more claims he used hookers supplied by a vice network in Lille, northern France.

Strauss-Kahn confessed to attending many group sex sessions but insisted he did not know the young women were hookers and that he often had sex with ‘willing girls’ in their 20s.

He is now under ‘judicial control’ on £85,000 bail pending a decision on whether he should face trial.

The hugely experienced economist has meanwhile made a discreet return to public life, giving a speech on the global finances in China and advising the Greek government on their massive debts.
