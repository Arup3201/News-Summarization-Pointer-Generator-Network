A 12-year-old girl was attacked by an otter while swimming at a Wisconsin lake on Saturday.

Rory Kliewer was climbing out of Bone Lake when the 40-pound creature jumped on her, clawing and biting her face and body.

I'm pretty traumatized,' the Minneapolis girl told TwinCities.com. 'I'm pretty positive I'll get back to swimming in pools, but I don't ever know if I'll ever get back to swimming in lakes.'

Attacked: Rory Kliewer, 12, was chased and mauled by a 40-pound otter at Bone Lake in Wisconsin on Saturday

Injured: The 40-pound otter bit Rory Kliewer's face before pulling itself onto her and continuing to bite and scratch her body

Injured: After the attack, Rory Kliewer was taken to a local emergency room where her scratches and bruises were treated

Rory said she managed to throw the three-foot-long otter off her after it bit her thigh and backside.

However the otter jumped onto the dock and chased her.

When a family friend tried to scare off the otter, it rose up on its hind legs and hissed.

The otter didn't back off until the owner of the cabin where Rory was staying yelled at it.

'As far as I'm concerned, this thing was literally trying to kill this kid,' Pat Hinschberger told TwinCities.com.

Hinschberger said he's been going to Bone Lake his whole life and has never witnessed or heard about an otter attack.

'Nobody I have at our cabin is going in the water until those otters are gone - that's the way I look at it,' he said. 'I can't chance something like that happening again.'

Rory was taken to a local hospital where she received 10 shots and gashes on her torso and legs were treated.

'Afterwards, I was kind of amazed that in less than a minute it could do all of this, which was pretty scary,' Rory told CBS.

'I was wearing a life jacket. If I hadn’t been, it probably would’ve pushed me under and drowned me.'

The news comes after a boy and his grandmother were viciously attacked by a male otter as they were swimming in a river near Seattle last week.
