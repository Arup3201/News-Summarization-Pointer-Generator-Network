French-born Fabrice Anthamatten, 39, was convicted in both France and Switzerland on rape charges dating back as far as 2001

A man-hunt is underway in Switzerland after the body of a Swiss therapist was found dead in the woods in Switzerland just hours after she had escorted a convict on a reintegration to society session.

Adeline Morel, a 34-year-old mother and therapist, went missing with Fabrice Anthamatten, 39, yesterday.

Her body was hidden in a bag in the woods in Versoix near the Swiss city.

Anthamatten had been charged with rapes going back more than 10 years.

French-born Anthamatten was serving out his sentence at Geneva’s Champ-Dollon prison - he was convicted in both France and Switzerland on rape charges dating back as far as 2001.

Back then he was given a five-year sentence for rape and in 2003 he was given another 15 years.

The pair failed to show up for an equestrian therapy session scheduled for yesterday morning.

They were seen travelling in a white Citröen Berlingo with licence plates GE 719 149, according to local police.

Police forces in Switzerland, France and Germany are combing the area around Geneva and Basel, using helicopters and policedogs, following a tip-off that Anthamatten may be hiding there.

Anthamatten was permitted to leave the Geneva prison under Morel’s escort for the purposes of 'reintegrating' him into society, thelocal.com writes.

A criminal investigation has been launched into the affair, while Anthamatten remains on the run.

The case has raised questions about leniency towards convicts and how a convicted rapist could have been trusted to leave the prison with only a woman as an escort.

It also resembles another case in May this year, when convicted murderer Claude Dubois, 36, strangled a 19-year-old woman in Payerne in the Canton of Vaud, the French-speaking western part of Switzerland.

Dubois, who was later arrested, was serving a prison sentence at home while wearing an electronic surveillance bracelet.
