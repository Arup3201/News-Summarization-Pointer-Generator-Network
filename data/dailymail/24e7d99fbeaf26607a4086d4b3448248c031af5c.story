The job of a stunt pilot is already dangerous enough, but these thrillseekers took their job to even more extremes by performing tricks while their planes were chained together.

The impressive video shows three stunt planes flying while chained wing-to-wing above an airfield near Neuquen, Argentina.

The pilots perform incredible manoeuvres despite the heavy chains tethering them to one another. 

An impressive video has emerged of three stunt planes flying while chained wing-to-wing above an airfield near Neuquen, Argentina

The show was put on by members of the Escuadrilla Argentina de Acrobacia Aerea aerobatic team.

The video begins with the planes lined up on the runway, the tethers dragging along on the ground between them.

But as the propeller planes take off toward the skies, the pilots fan out and extend the chains to their maximum length.

Flying in formation, the pilots put on a breathtaking show – complete with steep dives and whirlwind loops.
