Posters for the hit musical Spamalot jokingly announce that it was ‘lovingly ripped off from the motion picture Monty Python and the Holy Grail’.

But there’s at least one man who’s unlikely to find that statement very funny.

He is Mark Forstater, who produced the original 1975 film and is now suing the Monty Python team for a share of the profits from the hugely successful stage spin-off.

Mr Forstater, 69, described yesterday 
as the ‘seventh Python’, claims he was promised an equal share of all 
Holy Grail merchandising and off-shoots – along with stars Michael 
Palin, Eric Idle, John Cleese, Terry Jones, Terry Gilliam and Graham 
Chapman.

Spamalot has already grossed more than £110million during a four-year stint on Broadway.

Yesterday, a judge at London’s High 
Court heard how Mr Forstater, of Queens Park, West London, was in 
financial difficulties having been declared bankrupt. His lawyer Tom 
Weisselberg said the row broke out after the ‘huge international 
commercial success of Spamalot,’ which is currently running in the West 
End.

He said that for financial purposes, Mr Forstater should be treated as ‘the seventh Python’.

He told Mr Justice Norris: ‘This claim
 arises out of a dispute regarding profit-sharing of revenues from the 
British comedy film Monty Python and the Holy Grail.

‘Regrettably, the parties have not 
been able to resolve the dispute. Mr Forstater is in difficult financial
 circumstances and has been forced to bring these proceedings.’

He said the claim concerns the 
interpretation of a profit-sharing agreement signed by Mr Forstater with
 the Pythons’ company back in 1974, the year before the Holy Grail film 
was released.

Mr Forstater claims he signed an agreement to allow him one seventh of the Pythons’ share of any merchandising and spin-offs.

The surviving Pythons claim this sum 
was only ever 1/14. Exactly how much Mr Forstater is claiming was not 
stated in court, but after the hearing he told the Mail he was seeking a
 ‘ball-park figure’ of £250,000.

Mr Weisselberg added: ‘We say it is 
common ground that Mr Forstater was entitled to a share in the 
merchandising and spin-off from the film. The dispute relates to the 
extent of that entitlement.

‘The outrage expressed by a number of 
Pythons in their witness statements as to the suggestion that Mr 
Forstater was to be treated as the seventh Python is, with respect to 
them, misguided.’

Jones, 70, Palin and Idle, both 69, 
attended the start of the five-day hearing yesterday. They are expected 
to give evidence next week.

However, Cleese, 73, who lives in Monaco, 
and Gilliam, 72, who is filming in Romania, will not appear.

Written by 
Idle, Spamalot opened on Broadway in February 2005 and moved to the West
 End the following year.

The sell-out musical, a comic take on the story
 of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table, has now returned for
 another run in London.

Palin is reported as referring to the 
money-spinning musical, which includes the hit number Always Look On The
 Bright Side Of Life, as his ‘pension plan’.

Forstater is also claiming entitlement to money from the film company Freeway Cam which owns the copyright to the Holy Grail.

The hearing continues.
