Dr Mehmet Oz today offered to help 'drain the swamp' of unscrupulous marketers using his name to peddle so-called miracle pills and cure-alls to millions of Americans desperate to lose weight.

Appearing before the Senate's consumer protection panel, Oz was scolded by Chairman Claire McCaskill for claims he made about weight-loss aids on his TV show, 'The Dr. Oz Show'.

Oz, a cardiothoracic surgeon, acknowledged that his language about green coffee and other supplements has been 'flowery' and promised to publish a list of specific products he thinks can help America shed pounds and get healthy - beyond eating less and moving more.

On his show, he never endorsed specific companies or brands but more generally praised some supplements as fat busters, including green coffee extract, raspberry ketone and garcinia cambogia.

Not impressed: Senator Claire McCaskill scolded Dr Oz for claims he made about weight-loss aids on his show

McCaskill took Oz to task for a 2012 show in which he proclaimed that green coffee extract was a 'magic weight loss cure for every body type'.

'I get that you do a lot of good on your show,' McCaskill told Oz, 'but I don't get why you need to say this stuff because you know it's not true.'

Oz, who made his TV debut on the Oprah show, insisted he believes in the supplements he talks about on his show as short-term crutches, and even has his family try them. But there's no long-term miracle pill out there without diet and exercise, he said.

'I recognize they don't have the 
scientific muster to present as fact but nevertheless I would give my 
audience the advice I give my family all the time,' he said. 'I have 
given my family these products.'

Scam: After Dr Oz praises products on his show, companies then use his image to sell them, he said

Claire McCaskill, the senator who attacked Dr Oz for supporting weight-loss supplements, showed people just how it should be done - by losing weight with healthy eating and exercise.

'I'm tired of looking and feeling fat. Maybe talking about it publicly will keep me on track,' she wrote on Twitter in 2011.

She went on to share updates of her fitness goals and eating habits on her profile.

'It's official. I have divorced bread and pasta,' she wrote in one tweet to her thousands of followers. 'I'm hoping someday we can be friends again.'

After just five months, she reached her goal of losing 50 pounds.

But McCaskill responded: 'The 
scientific community is almost monolithically against you in terms of 
the efficacy of the three products you called miracles.'

Within
 weeks of Oz's comments about green coffee - which refers to the 
unroasted seeds or beans of coffee - a Florida-based operation began 
marketing a dietary supplement called Pure Green Coffee.

It claimed that the chlorogenic acid found in the coffee beans could help people lose 17 pounds and cut body fat by 16 per cent in 22 weeks, and charged $50 for a one-month supply.

The company, according to federal regulators, featured footage from 'The Dr. Oz Show,' to sell its supplement. Oz has no association with the company and received no money from sales.

Last month, the Federal Trade Commission sued the sellers behind Pure Green Coffee and accused them of making bogus claims and deceiving consumers.

The weight-loss industry is an area where consumers are particularly vulnerable to fraud, Mary Koelbel Engle, an associate director at the FTC, testified at the Senate hearing.

Advice: Dr Oz, pictured on his show, agreed that his language about supplements has been 'flowery'

She said the agency conducted a 
consumer survey in 2011 and found that more consumers were victims of 
fraudulent weight-loss products than of any of the other specific frauds
 covered in the survey.

Oz 
stressed during the hearing that he has never endorsed specific 
supplements or received money from the sale of supplements. Nor has he 
allowed his image to be used in ads for supplements, he said.

'If
 you see my name, face or show in any type of ad, email, or other 
circumstance,' Oz testified, 'it's illegal' - and not anything he has 
endorsed.
