Third victim: William Currie from Penzance was on a winter skills training course when he died in the Cairngorms last Thursday

The third climber killed in an avalanche in the Scottish Highlands last week has been named today.

William Currie, 18, from Penzance, Cornwall, was one of three people on a winter skills training course who died in the Cairngorms on Thursday.

Mr Currie - who was a student on the second last day of a course at the nearby Glenmore Lodge outdoor centre - was among two parties of six climbers in a 120ft gorge on the popular Lairig Ghru walk between Deeside and Speyside when the avalanche happened.

Nine other people who were on the mountain at the time of the avalanche escaped unhurt.

The three victims died when they were buried under 13ft of snow said to be like 'concrete'.

Northern Constabulary said a report has been submitted to the Procurator Fiscal but investigators are unsure as yet why the avalanche happened.

The principal of Glenmore Lodge, Bob Kinnaird, said today that Mr Currie was the first fatality at Glenmore Lodge for more than 40 years.

The other two victims, both RAF officers, have already been named as Flight Lieutenant Fran Capps, 32, from Dulverton in Somerset, and Squadron Leader Rimon Thann, 33, of RAF Valley, North Wales.

Flight Lietenant Capps had been commissioned into the RAF in 2001 as a Logistics Officer and worked on a variety of stations, most recently with the Chinook Force at Royal Air Force Odiham at Hook in Hampshire.

She had served on operational tours in Iraq, the Falkland Islands, Afghanistan and Qatar.

She lost her life together with Squadron Leader Rimon Than, 33, of RAF Valley, North Wales, where Prince William is based as a search and rescue pilot.

Both Squadron Leader Than and Flight Lieutenant Capps were members of the RAF Mountaineering Association.

Tragic: Flight Lieutenant Fran Capps was the second to be named after three people were killed following an avalanche in the Cairngorms

Police, Cairngorm mountain rescue 
team, Cairngorm mountain ski patrol, search and rescue dogs, RAF 
Lossiemouth's rescue team and three helicopters were involved in the 
rescue operation following the avalanche on Thursday.

The three victims were all airlifted from the 
Chalamain Gap area to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary shortly after 12.30pm but died of their injuries.

Mark Diggins, co-ordinator of the 
SportScotland Avalanche Information Service, said following the operation that rescue teams
had worked 'incredibly hard' to dig out and locate the three casualties
as quickly as possible.

He said it has been a 'challenging' winter in the area in terms of the weather conditions.

'There have been violent winds, very changeable conditions and that has an effect on the snow pack,' he said.

The incident was the latest in a series of deaths on the Scottish Highlands so far this year.

Of the nine people to have been killed on Scottish mountains in less than a month five have been medics.

On January 19 four climbers died on 3,773ft Bidean Nam Bian in Glencoe having being caught up in an avalanche.

Dr Rachel Majumdar, 29, who was 
working at Harrogate District Hospital in Yorkshire and junior doctor 
Una Rachel Finnegan, 25, from County Antrim, Northern Ireland, were 
among those who died after the 1,000ft fall descending the mountain.

Dr Majumdar`s boyfriend Tom Chesters, 28, who also died in the tragedy, was studying for a PhD in osteoporosis.

And on January 26, 22-year-old 
medical student Ben St Joseph from Essex fell over 300 feet to his death
on Ben Nevis, Britain`s highest mountain at 4,409ft.

First to be named: Squadron Leader Rimon Than was also killed in the avalanche on Thursday

Scene: Emergency services were called out to reports of the snowdrift in the Chalamain Gap area of the Cairngorms

Helicopter: Two helicopters from RAF Lossiemouth, Rescue 137 and 138, were involved in the operation
