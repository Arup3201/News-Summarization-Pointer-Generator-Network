The birth of Prince George has inspired the Queen to invite Carole and Michael Middleton to Sandringham so the future king can spend his first Christmas with both sets of grandparents, it emerged today.

In a break from tradition, the Duchess of Cambridge's parents have been asked to Her Majesty's Norfolk estate over the festive period.

Prince William spent last Christmas at the Middleton's mansion in Bucklebury, Berkshire, because his wife was pregnant.

Kate's sister Pippa may also be invited to Norfolk, where she would join all the senior royals including the Duke of Edinburgh, Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall, Camilla.

The family event could also coincide with the Cambridges moving into their new 10-bedroom country bolthole in the grounds of Sandringham.

William, Kate and Prince George are likely to move into Anmer Hall in a matter of months and are spending large sums to make the Norfolk mansion more private, secure and comfortable.

'This year's celebrations are set to be extra special after Prince George's arrival,' a royal source told The Sun.

'What better way to mark such a magical year than by having the whole family present?.

'Kate is very close to her family. Any child's first Christmas is one no grandparent would want to miss'.

George's playful uncle Prince Harry is also set to be there after missing it last year when he was fighting in Afghanistan.

The
Middletons could make it the biggest Christmas for some years at 
Sandringham, with the majority of The Queen's children, grandchildren 
and great-grandchildren likely to be there.

Pricesses Eugenie and Beatrice as well as the pregnant Zara Phillips and her rugby star husband Mike Tindall are set to attend.

At the heart of the celebrations is the Christmas Day service at the estate's church, which the Queen almost missed because Prince Philip was unwell in 2012.

This year's service is likely to be the first time Prince George has been seen in public since his birth in July.

Kensington Palace refused to comment today.
