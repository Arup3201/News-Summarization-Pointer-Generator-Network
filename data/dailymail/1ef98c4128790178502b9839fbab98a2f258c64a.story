It boasts a list of ingredients that looks like a family shopping list.

Made with 10 each of eggs, bacon rashers, sausages, tomatoes, mushrooms and hash browns, and not to mention a generous side of baked beans, the mammoth breakfast is on sale in Kent.

And for diners with a huge appetite who manage to finish the mega meal, packing in more than 7,500 calories, it comes at half-price, costing £10 instead of £20.

Mammoth fry up: The 10Terden Terminator Breakfast has over 70 ingredients including bacon rashers, eggs, sausages, hash browns, mushrooms, tomatoes, fried bread, toast and baked beans 

The mammoth meal was added to the menu in August and the closest person who came to finishing it was a bodybuilder from Devon, who threw in the towel after admitting he couldn't eat anymore

The breakfast is the brainchild of Papa Joe's Cafe in Tenterdon, and contains 512 grams of saturated fat.

The one-and-a-half-foot-long dish forms the cafe's 10Terden Terminator Mega Breakfast Challenge - and in the past four months since its launch, hundreds of body builders and truck drivers have taken it on - and all have failed it.

Three couples have finished it - but no individual has managed to polish off the huge meal; and mugshots of the failed eaters grace the Wall of Shame inside the cafe.

Cafe Owner, Sharon Naden, 44, said: 'The closest person who came to eating it was a body builder from Dover.

'But he left two and a half sausages, two and a half mushrooms and one hash brown on his plate before admitting he just couldn't eat anymore.

The monster meal - which was added to Papa Joe's Café's menu in August - has created a real buzz in the town of Tenterdon.

Sharon adds, 'We're only a small café. The whole Terminator breakfast challenge started off as being a bit of fun but now it's gone to becoming quite a big deal in the town!'
