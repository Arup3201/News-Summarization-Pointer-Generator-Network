Keisuke Honda has urged his team-mates not to show Greece the same level of respect that they afforded Ivory Coast in their opening World Cup group game.

The 28-year-old opened the scoring for Japan against the Elephants on Saturday with a superb 16th-minute effort, but they eventually lost 2-1 after being pegged back by two goals in three minutes from Wilfried Bony and Gervinho in the second half.

And Honda believes his team-mates were overawed by Ivory Coast's array of stars, and hopes they can focus on their own qualities as they look to keep their Brazilian dream alive against the Greeks.VIDEO Scroll down to see the moment 35,000 fans erupt in Tokyo when Honda scores

'I think there were a few causes (for the defeat) but especially I think we might have respected the opponents too much," the 28-year-old told reporters.

'It means that our consciousness to take the opponents' strengths away might be bigger than the one to show our own strong points.

'Yes, playing aggressively is what we have built up and it is our belief and fundamental for our confidence.

'There were some dangerous players of Ivory Coast and there are some of Greece too and we need to show the respect to them but it is better not to show it too much.

'Although we have our back to the wall, our confidence is still solid.

'Being eliminated from the competition may be coming up in discussion but I never have such an idea and all I am thinking about is to win over Greece and to prepare for the game after, against Colombia.'
