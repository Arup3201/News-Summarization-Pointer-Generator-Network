A wife whose husband left their home 20 months ago without a word and hasn't been seen since hasn't lost hope of him being found.

Terrie Beardsley, 44, from Old Tupton, Chesterfield, has tirelessly sent emails, created posters and walked the streets where there have been sighting of her husband, Tim, since he disappeared in July 2012.

Now she has appeared on TV show This Morning to make a direct appeal for him to come home.

TV appeal: Terrie Beardsley appeared on This Morning to beg her missing husband, Tim, to come home

Won't give up: Terrie told Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield that she's certain he's still alive

She said: 'I have thought a lot that the longer he has been away, the harder it is for him to come back or contact someone he knows.

'We all want him to come home, all his previous problems have been sorted. Work is sorted and everyone who knows him just wants him home.

'If he was watching I'd tell him I love him so much, come home. Call the Missing People helpline or anyone whose number you remember.'

Terrie told presenters Holly 
Willoughby and Phillip Schofield how she and Tim, 46, had been happily 
married for nine years before his disappearance.

They
 had grown up together in the village of Ashover, Derbyshire, before 
starting to date in their twenties and then tying the knot in 2003.

Terrie
 said they had lived like any other married couple, working, sharing the
 household chores and enjoying holidays and weekends away when they 
could.

However, Tim had 
previously battled depression and before he went missing, he had been 
concerned about his symptoms returning and had made an appointment to 
see his GP.

He had been 
become increasingly stressed running his own business as a motor-sport 
mechanic and Terrie admits he was "over-worked".

On

 the morning of 9 July, 2012, he got up and left their marital home 
without his mobile while Terrie was in the bathroom. He didn't say 
goodbye or tell her where he was going.

The only sure sign of him since has been the discovery of his car which was abandoned by Ullswater Lake in Cumbria, 
150 miles from his home.

No other trace of him was found at the beauty spot and he hasn't used his bank accounts since.

Many suggested he had commit suicide but a body was never found after a search of the lake and surrounding area.

Terrie is certain Tim is still alive.

'I
 am convinced he would not have jumped into lake,' she said on This 
Morning. 'There's nothing that points to the fact he isn't alive, 
there's only positives.'

Happy: Terrie said they had been like any other couple, sharing domestic tasks, working hard and enjoying holidays when they had the chance

Terrie,
 with the support of the charity Missing People, has done everything she
 can to search for Tim and raise awareness of his disappearance. As well
 as going on This Morning, she will also share her story in the Channel 4
 series The Missing. 

Various appeals so far have led to sightings
 of Tim - some in Birmingham - and Terrie has always followed up on them 
on, trawling the streets and handing out flyers.

She said she has no intention of moving on and won't entertain the idea of a
 new relationship until she knows exactly what has happened to Tim.

She
 told Holly and Phillip that even if Tim doesn't want to resume his 
married life with her, she could come to terms with that as long as she 
knows he is ok.

She said: 'Even if he doesn't want to come back we just want to know he's safe so we can then move on.'

No trace: But Terrie hasn't given up hope that Tim is still alive following his disappearance in July 2012

In
 a previous interview with the Daily Mail, Terrie revealed how she and 
Tim's divorced mother, Jean, 65, have not given up hope of finding him.

She said: 'We’ve been through every theory, possible and impossible, of 
what may have happened to him. His mum says: "Perhaps he’s lost his 
memory." Maybe he's re-invented himself with another identity. We don't 
know. We can only speculate. "Well he could be…" is the phrase I hear 
most.'

She added: 'Sometimes I cry over 
daft things. Something will remind me of Tim and the floodgates will 
open. Often, I wake up in the morning and look over to where he should 
be lying and  think: "What's the point?" He's not there beside me. And I
 know he should be.

'What I 
miss most is making plans with him - where to go for holidays, for 
weekends away. But I don't make plans any more. I don't think beyond the
 next week.'
