Wildlife selfie: Jack Gangwish, a 21-year-old defensive end for the University of Nebraska, grabbed a selfie with the critter

A college football player got bitten by a raccoon after stopping on a drive through rural Nebraska to take a selfie with it.

Jack Gangwish, 21, a defensive end for the University of Nebraksa's Cornhuskers, spotted the 'soft and friendly' critter while driving near Lincoln, Nebraska, and stopped to take a picture with it.

But seconds after he had taken the snap, the animal bit him on the calf - prompted a violent reaction from the 6'2", 260lbs college junior, who killed it with a wrench.

'It was a raccoon selfie gone completely wrong', Gangwish explained to his local newspaper the Lincoln Journal Star. 

He took to the animal afterwards with a crescent wrench from his pick-up truck so that it can be tested for rabies - which could have been transmitted from the bite.

Gangwich later tweeted to his followers: 'Guys… I got bit by a raccoon… It just looked so soft and friendly I couldnt [sic] help it!'

He later joked about having rabies and posted a tweet declaring himself 'THE COON WHISPERER'.

He later removed the messages. 

Experts recommend that any raccoon which bites a person should be 'humanley euthanized' so that its brain can be tested for signs of the infectious disease.

Gangwish, who plays as number 95 for the Cornhuskers, has lived in rural Nebraska all his life, hailing from Wood River, a town of 1,300 in the center of the state.

Revenge: The football player tweeted this picture of the bite the creature made on his leg - before he killed it with a wrench so the raccoon can be tested for rabies

His University of Nebraska biography describes the agricultural economics student as: 'a standout in the weight room throughout his career, adding more than 30 pounds of muscle since arriving on campus.

'Gangwish spent the majority of the spring working with the second unit at end and will have an opportunity to see action behind projected starters Randy Gregory and Greg McMullen.

'The walk-on from Wood River, Neb., has shown the relentless attitude to work his way into a position to contend for playing time.'
