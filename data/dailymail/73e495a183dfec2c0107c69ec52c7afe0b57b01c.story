Read Chris Foy's report from Twickenham 

Stuart Lancaster has admitted he is feeling the heat following England’s fifth consecutive defeat on Saturday.

After his side lost 31-28 to South Africa at Twickenham, Lancaster conceded: ‘Clearly the pressure is on because we’ve not achieved our objectives.’

But despite England’s woeful form, their head coach was still trying to be positive about their performances.

England coach Stuart Lancaster admits the pressure is on his team after they suffered their fifth straight loss

South Africa came out on top 31-28 at Twickenham on Saturday to inflict another defeat on England 

‘We’ve had five games against the top two sides in the world and we’ve not been smashed in any of them,’ he said. ‘In a lot of ways we’ve been reasonably dominant against them. ‘Internally there’s a very strong group working hard together and there’s no sense of the pressure affecting people.’

Nevertheless, England are poised to make changes for the third QBE Test against Samoa in five days’ time, with a leading source of concern being the form of fly-half Owen Farrell.

There will be a potentially ‘nasty’ review today before urgent steps are taken to rectify the glaring deficiencies which are undermining their build-up to next year’s home World Cup.

England's Springbok loss comes a week after their defeat by New Zealand and 11 months before World Cup 

Flanker Tom Wood said that England need to keep on plugging away with the World Cup coming up

Lancaster said: ‘I don’t think any team stops developing or learning but the clock ultimately stops at the World Cup. You also know that if you don’t win in the short term, while also trying to develop the side in the long term, then pressure can be caused by not winning consistently.’

Flanker Tom Wood added: ‘We understand we will come under a lot of pressure now. Everyone relates everything to the World Cup and puts it in that context and we just have to stay tight, keep plugging on and make sure we keep doing the basics well and preparing as well as we can.’

There have been widespread calls for Farrell to be dropped in the light of his poor form and the fact that he appeared to be in considerable discomfort on Saturday. But Lancaster said: ‘We have a lot of faith in Owen as a player and as a person. We’ll be sticking by him.’
