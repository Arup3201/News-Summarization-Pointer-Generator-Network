Struggling under the weight of packed bags from luxury stores including Prada and Louis Vuitton, Amy Jiang pauses for breath. The glittering mall is doing a brisk trade, with queues thronging the popular shops and the most sought-after fashion items selling out fast.

Giggling, Amy inspects her purchases, including a £1,010 bubblegum-pink Miu Miu cashmere sweater, a black Gucci cocktail purse costing £430, a £335 Vuitton shawl and a Prada robot key-chain costing a mere £115.

After flying to London from Beijing for a few days, the 25-year-old hasn’t tagged on the lavish shopping spree as a holiday treat. This was why she came.

Like thousands of other Chinese nationals she is in the UK during Golden Week, China’s national anniversary holiday — and a full-on British shopping spree is how to celebrate.

This year is London’s busiest Golden Week ever, with more than 200,000 Chinese estimated to visit, bringing a welcome boost of around half a billion pounds to our economy.

Some might think Amy’s haul from the Westfield shopping centre in West London is a tasteless display of extravagance. But she’s keen to point out she’s sleeping on a friend’s sofa to save cash for shopping — and she’s visited High Street chain stores, too.

The marketing student says: ‘Once a year there is nothing like a big mall experience to get all the luxury brands under one roof and go on a spree,’ she beams, proudly holding up her shopping bags like trophies. ‘It’s like being Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman.

‘The brands my friends and I really love are Prada and Louis Vuitton. But we all love the British High Street, too, especially Topshop.’

This year, the People’s Republic of China celebrates its 65th anniversary, during which the whole nation gets three days paid holiday for Golden Week. Its government started the tradition in 1999 to boost domestic tourism, but since then it has become the fashion for the wealthier inhabitants to fly abroad.

China’s economy has been booming in recent years. Its purchasing power is set to exceed that of the U.S. this year, and is on track to become the number one global economy by the early 2020s. In short, it has produced some seriously wealthy young things, eager to spend their cash.

VisitBritain has set up a Great China Welcome Charter to train businesses on how to encourage Chinese visitors, with the aim of trebling numbers here by 2020. Last month, Chancellor George Osborne announced the UK would fund 25,000 tourist visas every year to boost numbers further still.

Myf Ryan, director of marketing in the UK and Europe for Westfield, says that even before that announcement, China had become ‘the number one international market to visit Westfield London, particularly The Village — the luxury area of the mall.

‘Three years ago, it became evident that the Chinese market was rapidly becoming one of the strongest emerging markets, and it was at this point that Westfield introduced Cantonese and Mandarin-speaking concierges and translated the mall guides.’

China has become ‘the number one international market to visit Westfield London, particularly The Village — the luxury area of the mall,' according to its director or marketing Myf Ryan 

Golden Week shopping in London this year is predicted to surge by 20 per cent.

Unlike Middle Eastern shoppers — who make a similar annual splurge in the capital in the summer, nicknamed the Ramadan Rush — the Chinese don’t usually drive around in flash cars making outrageous displays of wealth. Instead, they’ll take public transport, or — in the case of those descending on Bicester Village, the discount luxury retailer in Oxfordshire — go by coach.

But like the Middle Eastern tourists, they do spend unbelievable amounts of money.

Golden Week is in full swing at Selfridges, where student Annie Leung has just bought five handbags — one Prada, two Burberry and two Louis Vuitton — costing a total of £7,000.

The Burberry concession appears especially popular. ‘I’ll hold it for you if you like,’ says one canny assistant to a Chinese woman inspecting a £1,300 mac, adding, ‘but your size is going very quickly.’

It’s little wonder retailers refer to this Chinese custom as ‘The Great Wallets of China’.

Westfield’s Cantonese-speaking concierge service is designed to cater to the every whim of its wealthy visitors. The concierge confirms the Chinese are distinct from other nations, with their own cultural mores: ‘They are very organised and plan their trip day by day, hour by hour. They have done their research, and brand-wise they know what’s on-trend.

‘The Chinese don’t want to draw attention to themselves, they are just here for the Western experience. They don’t need to be patronised. The idea they want lots of bowing is a myth.

‘We have hands-free shopping, where bags are discreetly taken away and delivered to hotels. But the Chinese don’t avail themselves of that service. They’d be embarrassed.’

Kirsty Du and Han Zhun from Beijing have spent two hours in the Louis Vuitton store in Westfield’s luxury Village area, examining every bag they could lay their hands on.

They have bought two — a clutch and a wallet — and spent more than £3,000. They’re off to Gucci next.

The Chinese seem to love the convenience of everything under one roof. Han Dan and Wei Jing, from Shanghai, have bought shirts in upmarket Hawes & Curtis and Thomas Pink. They’re just getting started.

Student Dong Liang, 23, dressed casually in a lumberjack shirt and surrounded by bouncy female friends, takes more than an hour in exclusive jeweller Tiffany, choosing a diamond ring for his girlfriend back home.

Going on a shopping spree is ‘like being Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman,' says student Amy Jiang

As his friends tease him about the purchase, he walks away crimson-faced with embarrassment, with the light blue bag in one hand and a carton of juice in the other.

Westfield isn’t the only emporium cashing in. At top Cantonese restaurant Hakkasan, just off Oxford Street, there is a special Golden Week menu, with all the prices ending in eight — an auspicious number in China.

Meanwhile, entire four-star hotels, such as the 300-room Dorsett in Shepherd’s Bush and the 400-room Corus in Hyde Park, have been taken over by Chinese tour operators.

Harrods is a must-see destination for Chinese visitors, who can converse easily with the 100 Mandarin-speaking staff. Fred Huang, 23, is buying a Chanel handbag for his girlfriend, After discussing the purchase in his native tongue, Fred opts for the £3,000 black one rather than the yellow quilted version costing £2,990.

Harrods, like many luxury stores, now takes the CUP or China Union Pay card, which allows Chinese customers to see and complete the transaction in their own currency.

The visitors can also claim back VAT by filling in a form in-store. They then get 20 per cent of the price refunded to their card straight away. Smiling, Fred says: ‘It’s much cheaper here. Luxury goods are all more expensive in China. A Mercedes Benz, for example is three times the price.’

Xing Yuan, 19, a student from Shanghai, has bought two Tiffany rings for his girlfriend.

His friend Ran Tao blithely explains why the young people of China can buy things beyond the reach of their British contemporaries. ‘The academic level in China is high, and people work very hard, so they earn a lot of money now,’ he says.

The Chinese target a few brands — big global names such as Louis Vuitton, Dior or Prada, or British ‘heritage’ makes such as Burberry, Mulberry or Gieves & Hawkes.

Originality is not the point. There is a group mentality, and buying something one’s peers didn’t recognise would be peculiar. So back at Selfridges the Chanel concession is fit to burst, while younger, more obscure designers whom British shoppers are so proud of ‘discovering’ get ignored.

Coming out of the Hermes concession, I meet two students who have rushed straight from the airport, complete with their suitcases, so they wouldn’t miss a minute’s shopping.

Lily Chang, 22, has already bought a bag in Louis Vuitton, underwear in Victoria’s Secret and a necklace in Tiffany. That’s more than £2,000 in 40 minutes — and she has barely made a dent on her shopping list.

All over the store, there are eager Chinese spenders on the phone — calling home to refine an order from friends and family — or discussing goods quietly with each other.

These eager shoppers touch everything. In Selfridges’ watch department, one Chinese man is mulling over a £60,000 black number by Panerai while another girl tries to choose between a white-strapped Jaeger LeCoultre and an IWC, both more than £10,000.

Upstairs in luxury concession Celine, a Chinese woman is testing all the security-tagged bags for weight and examining them in every way.

Nearby, every single person in Celine and Prada is Chinese. In the Burberry children’s shop, three female students excitedly discover they can fit into the bigger children’s sizes.

Doug Hansi, 30, a company director from Beijing, is on a one-week shopping trip with his girlfriend Du Dou with an enviable budget of £10,000.

‘We’ll go to Regent Street and maybe Bicester Village,’ he says. ‘I’ll buy suits and maybe watches for my parents.’

Nicole Li, 25 from Hangzhou in Eastern China, has spent £1,350 on a Prada handbag. She says: ‘This is a new design you can’t find in China. I’m so happy with it.’

As Myf Ryan puts it: ‘The Chinese love luxury.’

And, of course, in London, luxury loves them right back.
