Houston Texans’ defensive end JJ Watt is fast gaining a reputation as the NFL’s Mr Nice and someone who’s heart is almost as big as his 6ft 5in, 295lb frame.

Watt is the kind of sports star that goes out of his way to make space in his busy schedule to meet his fans, especially those that are most deserving.

On Monday he came face-to-face with one of his bravest fans in the shape of a young man called Itzy Cagen.

As well as being one of Watt's biggest fans, Cagen is also the longest surviving quadriplegic in the world.

The victim of a tragic accident at the age of two, for more than 20 years ago Itzy has been confined to his wheelchair, and lacks the ability to eat, sleep and move around without relying on the help of another person or machine.

The meeting came about after Itzy’s helper Eran Melnik took to JJ’s Facebook fan page to tell him about one of his biggest fans.

Melnik wrote: ‘I have been his nurse for four years now and I don't think there is a bigger Texans fan out there. During the season, every morning I would wake him up and he would announce "J. J. SWATT!!!".

'Just thought you would like to know that he is out there and would love to meet you if at all possible. We understand that you are busy, but who knows? Send me a message if anything comes up....’

Almost immediately, Itzy's friends created a social media storm around the effort. Comedy writer Jenny Johnson shared the photo in a tweet to more than 300,000 of her followers, reports Kids of Courage.

After 103 days, nearly 1,500 Likes and more than 270 shares, the photo was seen by the NFL superstar on May 13. ‘We will make this happen,’ he succinctly commented on Melnik’s post.

On May 21st, 111 days after Melnik posted the photo, the wait was over. Itzy Cagen and JJ Watt met for the first time.

Later that day, Melnik took to Facebook once again: 'Thank you so much, JJ Watt, for taking the time out of your busy schedule to make Itzy extremely happy!

'It was great to meet a superstar who honestly is a genuinely good person. Gives me faith in humanity to know that someone with his status can be so generous and giving.'

'He is my hero,' Itzy wrote referring to Watt. He writes using his head, the only portion of his body that he is able to move at free will.

Equipped with a special device attached to his forehead, Itzy carefully pecked each letter.

This isn't the first time the NFL star has gone out of his way to connect with his fans. On Monday he paid a surprise visit to the home of Cristian Beasley, a young fan dealing with leukemia in Splendora, Texas.

Back in January, he ‘married’ a six-year-old fan whose mother had posted a heartbroken YouTube video of her sulking because she 'isn't 25 yet but wants to marry J.J. Watt.'

The video featured young Breanna, sobbing and feeling very sorry for herself.

‘I wish I was 25,’ she sobbed.

‘Why do you wish you were 25?’ her mother asks.

‘So I could marry JJ Watt.’

‘Do you love JJ Watt?’

‘Mmm-hmmm.’

‘He's handsome, isn't he?’

'Mm-hmm,' she nodded through the tears.

Someone sent Watt a link to the video and he decided he wanted to do something about it.

'I saw the YouTube video,' explained Watt. 'I hate to see 
tears on my fans. So we put it out there on Twitter and Facebook to see 
if we could find her.

The two meet in person at the Houston Texans' Reliant Stadium on Wednesday.

'She didn’t know I was going to be there. 
When she walked in, I had flowers and was down on one knee with a ring 
in my pocket,' explained Watt.

'I asked her if she would be my pretend wife for a day. She said yes of course.'

Watt brought along one of his white jerseys to act as a pretend wedding dress and the couple had their first dance to her favorite singer Justin Bieber.

'It was a very cool day. Very special to see such a smile on her face. To
have the ability to do that is so neat. Anytime I can give back to the 
fans. I want to do something if I can,' said Watt.

This heart-warming interaction with a young fan has certainly boosted Watt’s nice guy image with his growing legion of fans. He posted the pictures from their 'wedding' on Facebook and so far they have attracted 51,302 Likes, been shared 5,331 times and received 3,374 comments, the majority of which are people 

It’s almost impossible not to be a JJ Watt fan after this touching display of fan interaction, which puts so many of his NFL colleagues to shame.

On the field Watt had a great second season, he led the NFL in sacks, the Texans won the AFC South and he started last Sunday's Pro Bowl.

Up until recently Watt had complained that he is having trouble finding a girlfriend, but is now reported to be dating Sydney Leroux, a 20-year-old Forward on the US Women’s National soccer team.

Hopefully young Breanna hasn’t found out about that or she will be heartbroken all over again.
