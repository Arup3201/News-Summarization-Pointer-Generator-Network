Dauntless: Sgt Steve Brown found himself fighting for his life after confronting Ahla Timofei, 26, in the street after he attacked a defenceless young woman

A policeman who tackled a deranged attacker as he slashed at him with a samurai sword was named the bravest officer in England and Wales last night.

Sgt Steve Brown found himself fighting for his life after confronting Ahla Timofei, 26, in the street after he attacked a defenceless young woman in North London.

The knifeman repeatedly lunged at him with the weapon until the officer moved inside its arc and struck him with his metal baton.

Timofei dropped the sword and Sgt Brown leapt on top of him, holding him down until colleagues arrived.

When they searched his rucksack they found a terrifying arsenal of weapons including a crossbow, mallet, machete and gas masks.

Met officer Sgt Brown was named the overall winner of the Police Bravery Awards at a ceremony in Central London.

Sgt Brown was presented with the award, which is organised by the Police Federation, by Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe.

Earlier, the officer and 65 of his colleagues from 31 forces attended a Downing Street reception with Prime Minister David Cameron.

He beat off competition for the overall title from other officers who performed incredibly brave acts in the line of duty. They included:

- Pc Luke Gribble, of Avon and Somerset Police, who rescued a woman from rapidly rising flood water on the outskirts of Bristol.

- Three Cumbria officers, PCs Glenn Myerscough, Kevin Latham and Andrew MacFarlane, who tackled an armed gang.

- Essex officers Pcs Keith Lucas and Shane Robinson who rescued a man who exploded in flames after soaking himself in petrol.

- Two North Wales officers, Pcs John Harrison and Sgt Gareth Davies, who dealt with a gunman who claimed to have a bomb in Wrexham town hall.

- Sgt Christopher Foster who tackled a gunman who was beating another man with a long piece of wood during a snowstorm in Barnsley.

- Pc Roger French who went into a smoke-filled burning building in Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire, three times to drag two men to safety.

- Two Suffolk officers, Pcs Paul Osmond and Rebecca Gardiner, who stopped a drunk and distressed man from disembowelling himself and attacking them.

The dramatic confrontation involving Sgt Brown took place when he was called to an attack on a woman in Holloway Road, North London.

Witnesses heard the victim's screams after Timofei set upon her with his sword, severing her thumb and leaving her with wounds to her face, arms and legs.

As his partner gave first aid to the bleeding 22-year-old Italian woman, Sgt Brown confronted the sword-wielding maniac alone.

Describing what happened, Sgt Brown said: ‘I was running full pelt at him and he turned around and raised the sword straight up in the air.

‘He swung downwards and the sword missed my neck by about a foot. I stepped back and said ‘put the sword down’, but he didn’t listen and took a few more swings.

‘After spraying him he went to scratch his eye and I thought, I’ve got to do this now. I rushed in and he raised his sword again but I hit his arm as many times as I could and managed to jump on top of him and the cavalry arrived.

‘I could see in his eyes he wanted to kill me. I wasn’t going to see Christmas: I thought my luck had run out.’

Timofei, 26, was later found guilty of attempted murder and affray and a judge ordered that he spend the rest of his life in a secure mental health unit

Sgt Brown was guided to the swordman by a passer-by who saw the original attack and followed him while on the phone to a police operator.

The officer said: ‘I have no doubt that he wasn’t going to stop until he killed someone that night. I also have no doubt that any cop would have done the same.

‘I’m not a hero: the real hero is the member of the public who went above and beyond and followed him, having seen what he had done.’

Home Secretary Theresa May said: ‘The actions of Sgt Stephen Brown are a powerful reminder of the commitment and courage that police officers bring to their role.

‘He put his own life in danger to defuse a terrifying situation. His intervention protected the public and may well have saved the lives of others.

‘We should reflect on the bravery shown by all the officers nominated, and that displayed by all police officers in the course of their duties each day.’

Steve White, chair of the Police Federation of England and Wales, said: ‘I am constantly humbled and amazed by the selfless acts of bravery carried out by police officers on a day to day basis.

‘For every act of courage and bravery recognised in the Police Bravery Awards there are hundreds more that occur in our communities every day that go unrecognised.’
