A major car accident on the Sydney Harbour Bridge has caused chaos amongst commuters, with traffic stretching back to Sydney's city centre.

All lanes of the bridge have reopened after the multi-vehicle crash but roads around the city remain in gridlock.

The six-vehicle accident occurred just after 6.45am, closing all northbound lanes plus two of the five southbound lanes on the bridge.

Emergency crews cleared the accident by 8am but all roads approaching the CBD have been affected causing peak-hour chaos for commuters.

Motorists have been urged to take the ferry or train.

Two people were hurt in the accident and have been taken to hospital, an ambulance spokesman said.
