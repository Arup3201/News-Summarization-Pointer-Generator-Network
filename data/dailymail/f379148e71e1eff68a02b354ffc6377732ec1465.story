Superstitious motorists on the road today could be doubly hexed – for collision claims on ‘unlucky’ Friday 13th increase by 13 per cent, say insurers.

Aviva, the UK’s largest insurer said the traditionally ‘unlucky’ day sees more bumps and shunts than normal - no matter what time of year Friday 13th falls.

Its report notes: ‘The age-old superstition about falling prey to bad luck on Friday the 13th does in fact ring true for some motorists.

'Analysis of 10 years of our claims data reveals that motor collision claims increase by an average of 13 per cent on Friday 13th, compared to other days in the same month.’

Heather Smith, director of general insurance at Aviva, said: ‘Friday the 13th is traditionally a superstitious day for many but it’s spooky to see motor claims rise by an "unlucky" 13 per cent.

1. 50% use the phrase 'touch wood' in the hope that something bad won’t happen. 2. 43% avoid walking under ladders. 3. 36% avoid opening an umbrella indoors.4. 30% will not place a pair of new shoes on a table. 5. 26% believe Friday the 13th is an unlucky day.

‘While we don’t wish to cause a bout of friggatriskaidekaphobia - fear of Friday the 13th - among the population, we hope these figures will help encourage people to take extra care today, whatever they might be doing.’

Other research by the insurer revealed that around two thirds of people (63 per cent) admit to holding some superstitious beliefs, though just a quarter of us (26 per cent) believe that Friday 13th is an unlucky day.

Half the population admit to using the phrase ‘touch wood’ to prevent bad things from happening, while two-fifths (43 per cent) avoid walking under ladders and more than one in three (36 per cent) avoid opening an umbrella indoors.

When it comes to drivers, almost one in ten (9 per cent) said that they keep a lucky charm in their car and 5 per cent said they believe getting bird mess on their car is a good omen.
