Sharknado, a spoof movie about sharks on a killing spree on land, became a surprise blockbuster hit last year. 

But life imitated art (to an extent) when a church group witnessed more than 100 sharks risk beaching themselves in a shoreline attack last week.

Members of One Harbor Church filmed the feeding frenzy on the beach at Cape Lookout National Seashore, North Carolina.

Feeding frenzy: Over 100 sharks are seen feeding on a school of fish close to shore in North Carolina last week

The sharks came dangerously close to becoming stuck on land in order to feast on a school of blue fish in the shallow surf.

The video was shot by Donnie Griggs, who stumbled upon the scene as his church group fished for their evening meal for a camp retreat at noon last Thursday.

His friend Brian Recker uploaded the clip to Facebook and YouTube, the latter attracting over 87,000 views in just two days.

Plenty for everyone: Seagulls and pelicans joined in on the feeding frenzy, which lasted five minutes

Recker wrote on Facebook: 'Donnie Griggs shot this amazing video of the SHARKNADO we saw at Cape Lookout! Not sure what kind exactly they were, but there were over 100 in a feeding frenzy.'

'The men were out fishing for the evening’s dinner when they stumbled across more than 100 sharks attacking a school of blue fish,' Recker added on YouTube. 'As seagulls and pelicans joined in on the meal, the men began to cast into the surf, catching fish without the use of bait. 

'For more than five minutes, the sharks were observed swimming in and out of the surf, some of which became beached in the fury. 

Life imitates art? Satire movie Sharknado was a surprise hit last year

'Donnie Griggs, the cameraman who captured the footage, is an avid waterman who spearfishes, dives, swims and surfs at Cape Lookout often. 

Recker said that despite the furious sharks, he believes Cape Lookout to be safe for swimmers, adding that 'the presence of these sharks and large schools of fish is actually a sign of a very healthy ecosystem'.

Some commenters on YouTube expressed concern that sharks coming so close to shore to feed is a sign of humans over-fishing in the ocean.

Sharknado is a made-for-television film starring Tara Reid and Beverly Hills 90210 star Ian Ziering that became a cult hit when it aired last July on the Syfy channel.

The disaster movie satire sees a tornado lift sharks out of the ocean and spitting them out across Los Angeles, where they wreak havoc.

It was such a surprise hit that  a sequel was made, Sharknado 2: The Second One, which premiered on July 30. A third film is slated for 2015.
