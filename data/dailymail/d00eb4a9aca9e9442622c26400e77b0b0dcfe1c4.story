Rapist: Graham Kelly, 59, jumped over a fence armed with the kitchen blade and raped the woman in a stable in Driffield, near Hull, East Yorkshire, after stalking her for weeks

A rapist who attacked a woman while armed with an eight-inch carving knife was snared after his quick-thinking victim tricked him into coming back to her home for coffee.

Graham Kelly, 59, jumped over a fence armed with the kitchen blade and raped the woman in a stable in Driffield, near Hull, East Yorkshire, after stalking her for weeks.

But, in an attempt to save herself, the woman convinced Kelly she liked him and asked him back to her house so police could arrest him.

The victim, who can not be named for legal reasons, said: 'It was coffee or kill me. I chose coffee.'

She cried as a jury at Hull 
Crown Court took just 30 minutes to return a unanimous 
verdict, convicting Kelly of rape on Friday.

During his trial, the woman told how 'obsessive' Kelly would wait for her in lay-bys, stalk her in supermarkets and 'shower ' her with texts.

But when she spurned his advances, his lust turned to rage.

'He left a letter saying he was going to end his life and he had chosen the tree where he was going to do it,' she said.

And in a sinister twist, the woman knew Driffield murder victim
Linda Merigo, the mother stabbed to death in front of her young son in September 2010, 
and she feared Kelly was going to kill her.

'When he jumped over the fence with the knife in his hand, Linda Merigo flashed through my mind,' she said. 'I didn’t have time to think, I couldn’t get Linda off my mind.

'I was going to bleed to death in a field and never see my children again.'

With the carving knife held to her side, the woman tried frantically to come up with a plan to save her life.

'I was thinking how can I get out of this without him getting me,' she said.

'I was trying to convince him not to kill me. He had just raped me and said he was going to kill me.

'He asked for a coffee and I said 
"Yes, I will make you a coffee". I was safer knowing where he was and 
that the police were coming.'

She told Kelly to come back to her 
home for coffee. But, as she cycled home, she saw an elderly neighbour 
and asked him to call the police.

Kelly was waiting for her outside her home and she let him in, making him a coffee.

He was arrested when the police arrived ten minutes after the neighbour called 999.

Judge Mark Bury deferred sentence for reports.

He said: 'This could be a one-off 
piece of behaviour, which will never be repeated but I’m concerned this 
man does have an obsession with her and if he were to be released after 
an ordinary sentence, he might still harbour resentment.

'I want to know more about him before I sentence him.

'If it is the case he is a ticking timebomb, the sentence will be indefinite.'

After the verdict, Detective Constable Claire Burnett said Kelly had a dangerous obsession with his victim.

DC Burnett said: 'He pursued her 
relentlessly. He followed her, waited near her home and sent her text 
messages. Finally, he confronted her at knifepoint in an isolated 
location. The victim was understandably put in a terrified position.

'I am delighted with the verdict. Kelly will now be looking at a long term of imprisonment.'

Kelly, from Driffield, East Yorks, will be sentenced next month.

As he was remanded in custody to await sentence, DC Burnett said the woman was relieved Kelly had been convicted of rape.

She said: 'Throughout this ordeal, the victim has dealt with it in a dignified, respectful and brave manner. She is very relieved with the verdict.'
