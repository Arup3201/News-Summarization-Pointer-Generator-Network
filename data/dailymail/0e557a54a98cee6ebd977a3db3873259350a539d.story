Killed: Good Samaritan Charlene Reaveley had stopped to help the victim of a crash in Canada

A drunk driver who killed a mother of four after she stopped to help accident victims was yesterday jailed for seven-and-a-half years.

Fitness trainer Charlene Reaveley, 30, originally from Fintry, Dundee, died instantly when she was hit by a two-ton Jeep Cherokee travelling at nearly 40 miles an hour.

Driver Cory Sater was so drunk that he was ‘oblivious’ to the fact that Mrs Reaveley was at the roadside helping the victims of an earlier accident.

Yesterday, Mrs Reaveley’s mother Mary Ogilvie told a court in Canada: ‘Everything near and dear to me was taken away that night.’

The fitness trainer and her husband, Dan, had stopped on Vancouver’s Lougheed Highway half an hour after midnight on a February night in 2011 to help Lorraine Cruz, 26, and her boyfriend, Paulo Calimbahin, after their car hit the central reservation.

The couple and their friends Kimberley and Giacomo Debenedictis were heading home from a night out when they saw the Nissan Pathfinder spin and crash. They ran to help the occupants out of their damaged vehicle.

Moments later, Sater’s Jeep Cherokee side-swiped the Pathfinder and hit Mrs Reaveley, Miss Cruz and Mr Calimbahin.

Both women were catapulted more than 60 feet and killed outright, while Mr Calimbahin lost one of his legs.

Sater, a 40-year-old roofer, drove off. His car was found abandoned a few miles away. The single father of two was found guilty last year of two counts of causing death by dangerous driving and two of drink-driving causing death.

During a three-and-a-half week trial, the court heard he had spent the evening leading up to the crash downing Canadian whiskey and alcoholic ‘shots’, running up a $80 bar bill.

In addition to a jail sentence, Justice James Williams, judge at New Westminster Supreme Court, near Vancouver, banned Sater from driving for eight years.

Mrs Reaveley had emigrated to Vancouver, British Columbia, with her family at the age of seven.

At yesterday’s sentencing  hearing, observers on the public benches wiped away tears as her mother, her voice trembling, read out an emotional victim-impact statement.

She said: ‘Charlene was my only child. I am a mother now, but I do not have my child. Everything near and dear to me was taken away that night.

‘I’m haunted by the memories of her 
being buried. She was my only child and my entire world. She’s on my 
mind 24/7. As a family, we are in pain.’

Devoted: Mother-of-four Charlene Reaveley stopped to help the victims of another crash on a Canada highway

Toll: The 30-year-old's on-in-law, who suffers from post-traumatic symptoms, was too upset to address the court

She said she still suffered from depression, nightmares and anxiety, and was on medication.

Her son-in-law, who suffers from post-traumatic symptoms, was too upset to address the court. His sister read his statement in which he said he had contemplated suicide, but knew he had to keep living for the sake of his four children, who were ten, six, four and one when their mother died.

He said the loss of his childhood sweetheart was ‘like losing your sight after 30 years’.

Mr Calimbahin said in his statement: ‘Mr Sater took my leg and my job, but more importantly he took my future.’

Sater addressed the court in sobs. He said he tortured himself every day over the deaths, knowing the children had lost their mother.

Crown prosecutor Christopher McPherson had called his actions an ‘act of remarkable selfishness, on a par with manslaughter’.
