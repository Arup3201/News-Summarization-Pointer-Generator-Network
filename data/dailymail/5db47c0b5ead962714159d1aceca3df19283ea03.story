The mother of a passenger who died in the MH17 crash is suing the Ukrainian authorities for 'negligent homicide' and £650,000 in the European Court of Human Rights.

The German woman, whose daughter - named as 'Olga L' - was killed when the Malaysia Airlines plane was downed over eastern Ukraine in July, began legal proceedings in the past week.

She is seeking compensation from the authorities after Ukraine failed to close its airspace to civil air traffic because of fighting with pro-Russian separatists, it has been reported.

The indictment accuses it of failing to do so because it wanted to continue to profit from the fees paid by transit flights, according to German newspaper Bild am Sonntag.

It said that at the time, flights numbered 700 a day and would have earned it several million dollars a month.

Aviation lawyer, Elmar Giemulla, representing the victim's mother, argued that under international law, Ukraine should have closed its air space if it could not guarantee the safety of flights.

Giemulla said in September he was representing three families of German victims of the crash and the victim's mother is seeking compensation from Kiev for 'manslaughter by negligence'.

The airliner crashed in Ukraine in pro-Russian rebel-held territory on July 17, killing 298 people, two-thirds of them from the Netherlands. Four Germans died in the crash.

Ukraine has accused the rebels of shooting the plane down with an advanced Russian-made missile. 

Russia has rejected accusations that it supplied the rebels with SA-11 Buk anti-aircraft missile systems.

European governments have so far refrained from openly attributing blame.
