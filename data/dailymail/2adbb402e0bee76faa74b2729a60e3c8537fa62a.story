They are two of life's simplest pleasures: sitting back in a warm bath surrounded by bubbles and reclining in a hammock in an exotic location.

And now, the two have been joined together to create the ultimate relaxation experience: a bath tub hammock. 

Known as the Vessel, the sleek-looking tub is suspended in the air like a hammock.

At 2.7m long, the Vessel is longer than a regular bathtub, leaving plenty of room to share the experience

The tub is suspended from the walls and does not touch the floor, and is designed for use in a wet room 

The carbon fibre tub, designed by London-based Splinter Works, is filled using a floor standing tap before the waste water is released through the base into a floor drain. 

Miles Hartwell, from Splinter Works, said: 'Struck by the synergy between the shapes of two compelling symbols of relaxation, a hammock and a bath tub, we were inspired to develop a piece that would provide the ultimate vehicle for total escapism.

'The peaceful experience of kicking-back in a hammock has been further enhanced by combining it with the immersive comfort of soaking in a hot bath.

'By literally elevating the experience of bathing into a suspended sculpture, the bathroom has been reinvented as a contemplative sanctuary for artful relaxation.'

Stainless steel brackets fix the bathtub to the wall, which can be covered over, or left on show.
