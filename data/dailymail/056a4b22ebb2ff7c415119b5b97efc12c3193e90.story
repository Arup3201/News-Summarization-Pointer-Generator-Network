Jose Mourinho struggled to adapt to the pressure that came with being manager of Real Madrid, according to the club's former president Ramon Calderon.

Mourinho spent three years at the Santiago Bernabeu, from 2010-13, but despite winning La Liga and the Copa del Rey, he was a nearly-man in the Champions League with Spanish side, getting knocked out at the semi-final in every season at the club.

And Calderon believes that even Mourinho, who is renowned for turning up the heat on his rivals, could not cope with the pressure that was heaped upon his shoulders while at the helm of Madrid.

'To be a manager of Real Madrid is really, really difficult,' Calderon said to BBC World Service. 'See what happened to Mourinho.

'He is someone who is used to coping with pressure and he couldn't.'

In his second season at Madrid, Mourinho's side surged to the Spanish league title with a record of 100 points.

But at the end of his third year, a mutual agreement between Mourinho and the club was reached for a parting of the ways, and former Chelsea boss Carlo Ancelotti took over while Mourinho returned to Stamford Bridge.

'When Mourinho left, things were in a really bad situation,' Calderon said. 'He had to leave the club after three years of a lot of problems, a lot of confrontations.'

Ancelotti has since led Madrid to their tenth Champions League title, as well as masterminding his team to an astonishing run of 22 straight wins earlier this season.

And Calderon, who was president at the Bernabeu from 2006-09, praised Ancelotti's achievements with the club.

'I think he has done a very good job, not only because he won the Champions League but because things are calm, relaxed and everything is smooth,' Calderon explained.
