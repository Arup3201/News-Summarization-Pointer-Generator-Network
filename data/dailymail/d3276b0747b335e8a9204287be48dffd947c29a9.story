Celebrity contestants on Channel 4’s new skiing game show have been criticised for not wearing safety helmets by a brain injury charity.

Hairdresser Nicky Clarke and socialite Henry Conway were seen practising on an artificial ski slope during the first episode of The Jump without ski helmets.

It comes weeks after Formula 1 legend Michael Schumacher’s life was saved by wearing a helmet when he crashed while skiing in France.

Mr Conway, 31, who is the son of disgraced Tory MP Derek Conway, was seen wearing a black fur hat while on the training slope in the UK, whilst Mr Clarke, 55, let his famous tresses hang out.

During the programme aired on Sunday night, Mr Clarke said that he liked to ‘feel the wind in my hair’.

Mr Conway said: ‘I’m hoping to bring some style and sophistication to the slopes as everyone needs a bit of winter glamour.’

Luke Griggs, a spokesman for Headway, the brain injury association, said he believed the celebrity contestants should have set a better example.

He said: ‘Ski helmets offer vital protection to all skiers - whether novices on dry slopes here in the UK, or vastly experienced skiers going off-piste.

‘We have to make people realise that it is not only high-speed accidents that can lead to skiers suffering fatal or lifelong injury.

'Even a seemingly minor injury, such as that tragically suffered by Natasha Richardson on a nursery slope in 2009, can have a major impact.

‘To those who suggest they prefer to feel the wind in their hair rather than wearing a helmet, we would simply suggest they speak to Headway service users who felt the same way until they sustained a brain injury in a fall.

'For these people, and their families, life will never be the same.

‘The thrill of skiing or snowboarding is in no way diminished by the wearing of a helmet and we hope all the participants in The Jump will set a better example throughout the rest of the series by wearing helmets.’

The Jump features 12 celebrities, including Sinitta, Sir Steve Redgrave and Anthea Turner, competing in winter sports such as the skeleton, two-man bob, giant slalom and ski-cross.

Mr Clarke became the first contestant to be eliminated on Sunday night.

In 2008, Mr Conway’s father Derek was ordered to repay over £3,000 of public money that he had given to him while he was in his employment.

He was also suspended and expelled from the Tory party for paying his other son for work that he did not appear to have done.

In the same year, Henry reportedly threw a party called ‘F*** Off I’m Rich’.

A spokesperson for Channel 4 said: ‘The health and safety of those taking part in The Jump is the highest priority and all contributors are provided with necessary safety equipment to use during training and events. Safety equipment is mandatory during events.’
