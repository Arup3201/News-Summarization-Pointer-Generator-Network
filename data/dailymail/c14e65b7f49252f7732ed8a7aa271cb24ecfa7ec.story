What drew me to the sad little face staring mournfully out of my computer that day I can’t say. But of all the needy, vulnerable dogs on the rescue centre’s website, she seemed to be appealing directly to me for help.

A pair of huge, pleading eyes was framed by the beguiling bushy brows and mutton chop whiskers of the classic miniature schnauzer. In the days that followed I simply couldn’t put the thought of that little creature from my mind.

I gave myself a good talking to – my husband Michel and I already owned a boisterous puppy of the same breed, Renae. This was hardly the moment to introduce a traumatised rescue dog into our family. But something made me email the animal sanctuary.

Susie-Belle’s story was a terrible one. For six years she had lived – if you could call it that – in the cold and filth of one of Britain’s barbaric and all too numerous ‘puppy farms’. Tied up in the back of a putrid shed without natural light or companionship, she had been nothing more than a breeding machine.

Twice a year, in a relentless cycle of enforced mating, Susie-Belle had produced litter after litter of babies to satisfy the commercial demands of the rough end of the dog-breeding trade.

She would have been shot without mercy at the end of her working days. Breeding dogs like Susie-Belle are routinely kept in wire cages, often in the dark and sometimes stacked on top of each other – meaning that the animals lower down are left to live among the excrement falling from above, as well as their own filth. Their toes are splayed from standing on wire floors and many have hernias from prolonged, painful labours. Hideously distended stomachs and chronic back pain are the norm, the result of multiple pregnancies.

Susie-Belle was saved thanks only to the courage of the dedicated animal rescuers who are prepared to go into these grisly places and persuade commercial puppy producers that there are homes that would welcome their worn-out dogs as pets. When I first read about her, she was being fostered by a wonderful woman called Janet who has helped countless ex-puppy farm dogs live out their final days surrounded by warmth and love.

It was Janet to whom I spoke after reading about Susie-Belle, and with whom I arranged our first meeting. Susie-Belle was much smaller than I had imagined, very skinny, with a ragged looking coat that was a mixture of raw brown patches and her breed’s traditional pepper-and-salt hair.

When she’d first been rescued she was almost bald, Janet explained, with only a few tufts of filthy fluff here and there. It was as much as I could do not to scoop that gentle creature up right away in my arms and give her the biggest hug she’d ever experienced. 

Susie-Belle spent much of her life in a puppy farm, much like this one

After a few more successful visits it was agreed that Michel and I could take Susie-Belle out for the afternoon to our local beauty spot in Surrey. Janet had warned us that Susie-Belle would not like anyone walking behind her – this, I later discovered, is very common among such dogs. It probably arises from the many times that they are kicked out of the way, grabbed by their tails, harshly handled and roughly mated. Nothing good happens to breeding bitches when people are behind them.

And so it proved for the entire afternoon. Whenever Susie-Belle sensed anybody coming up behind us, she would stop still, firmly plant her feet in the ground and not move a muscle until that person had passed. But for the rest of her outing she was an absolute angel, trotting along perfectly at my heels on her lead. The following morning Janet reported that Susie-Belle had slept well and contentedly that night. It had been a success all round and I was floating on air.

Susie-Belle became officially ours in the late summer of 2011. Perhaps it was only to be expected, but she was painfully quiet at first, sitting silently in her bed watching everything going on, but not really engaging with us at all. We would often find our puppy, Renae, taking her toys over to Susie-Belle to see if she wanted to play, but she never did. Life for a battery farm dog is not one where having fun is encouraged.

Although we couldn’t know for certain what her life had been like, we guessed that in the puppy farm she would have had very little to do apart from sitting still for hours on end. Through necessity, Susie-Belle had adopted a patient acceptance and learned just to be present, but to expect nothing.

It saddened us dreadfully to see her like this, and to think of her sitting alone for all those years in a cold, hostile environment. To cheer ourselves up we would imagine instead that she had learned the art of meditation, achieving a Zen-like state of inner peace amid the misery that surrounded her.

Far more likely, of course, was that in addition to her joyless past, the busy, noisy environment of the normal world was entirely overwhelming for this frightened little dog. In order to survive she’d no doubt carefully disengaged herself from it till she felt more ready to cope.

We knew that it would take a long time for her to reach a state of sufficient relaxation to start feeling like a normal dog, so in order to speed things up I tried giving her a soothing massage – I have worked as a natural health practitioner and acupuncturist for a number of years, so for me it was the most obvious thing in the world to do. 

For Susie-Belle, though, it was initially far from a positive experience. I have never touched a living thing that felt so tense, whose skin bristled the moment my fingertips made contact.

For several weeks Susie-Belle would lie statue still during these sessions, heartbreakingly compliant with what was happening but not relaxing a single cell of her body. It seemed a very long time before the surface tension in her muscles finally softened.

The first time she let out a sigh of relaxed pleasure I could have wept with joy at what is for most dogs a normal sign of contentedness, but which for Susie-Belle was a major indication of progress and a huge step forward. 

Susie-Belle had arrived in our lives with a voracious appetite. Her fearfulness would temporarily fade at mealtimes and we indulged her in ways that would exceed most humans’ expectations of good food.

She ate every meal as if it might be her last – and for a dog that had until recently known what it was to feel the pain of starvation, why not? In those first few weeks with us she experienced not only the sweet taste of freedom but delicious meals of venison, rabbit and hare plus delectable morsels of roast goose and lobster.

While Susie-Belle’s physical recovery continued apace, I was still searching for ways to aid her mental healing. Some years previously we had re-homed an extremely nervous and aggressive cat that had been greatly helped by our local homeopathic vet. I had almost forgotten about the whole episode until Susie-Belle came to us, so desperately in need of expert assistance.

What the vet said took me aback completely, and before I could stop it my eyes filled with tears. He told me that the most important thing to do for Susie-Belle was to help her let go of the crippling grief that she was suffering.

It had never occurred to me that a dog might be affected by such a painful and disturbing emotion. But his view was that to live for years the way she had, being used to breed litter upon litter, to care for her puppies only to have them suddenly removed, probably too early, would have left her with enormous feelings of loss and bereavement over and over again.

It was a revelation. I left his surgery that day feeling that my understanding of Susie-Belle’s suffering had broadened enormously. In the days that followed I gave her the homeopathic pills as instructed, although I wasn’t expecting any major changes to occur.

Michel and I began to notice, however, very subtle signs of growing confidence. Susie-Belle began to interact with us whenever we initiated contact. One morning we got an awkward, stiff little dance with a light wagging of her docked tail when her breakfast was being prepared.

She showed signs of wanting to be almost playful with Renae, bumping her haunches into the younger dog’s as she half danced around. We dared to hope that she was letting some of her trauma go. Sceptics may say that all this might have happened irrespective of the homeopathy. But we didn’t mind either way. We were just glad that good things were starting to happen.

A day or so following her morning dance, we were out in the local park near a skateboard area full of children. Until that point, we had tended to give the place something of a wide berth with Susie-Belle, worried that she might have a bad reaction to all the movement and shouting.

But that afternoon, as we moved away from the skateboarding, a most wonderful thing happened. For the first time since we’d owned her, Susie-Belle let out an almighty WOOF!, followed by a series of joyous barks.

It was truly a sound to treasure. To my ears she was singing from her heart that day, on and on and on – a big, beautiful, slowly mending heart that was at last feeling ready to accept the richness of what life now offered her.
