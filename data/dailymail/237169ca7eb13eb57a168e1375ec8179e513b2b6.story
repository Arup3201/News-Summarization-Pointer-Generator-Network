Forget twitchy ass time, it could be sore backside season for Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal at Cambridge United on Friday night.

Because the League Two side's dugout is not exactly derrière friendly.

These pictures show exactly what kind of throne the man known as King Louis will perch on during tonight's FA Cup clash at the humble Abbey Stadium.

Louis van Gaal has stated that he gets a 'twitchy ass' when United play in a 4-4-2 formation

An uncomfortable-looking concrete block with a thin-looking cushion on top will be what faces the United supremo as the underdogs look to 'pile' on the pressure.

Speaking ahead of the trip to home side's 8,000-capacity home Van Gaal explained that he preferred using a 3-5-2 system because a more traditional 4-4-2 left his side open.

'All the matches when we play 4-4-2, like against West Ham United, it was always twitching your ass and I don’t like it,' he said.

Regardless of which system Wayne Rooney and co use tonight, their manager may again have his rear on his mind.

It is all a far cry from what the Dutchman is used to at Old Trafford.

Far from a concrete slab, Van Gaal and his staff sit in plush red seats which feature the embroidered club badge and the logo of sponsors Chevrolet.

And should the cold Manchester weather get too much, the dugout at the Theatre of Dreams also features a heated floor.

Chevrolet paid £12m for the privilege and the seats replaced those emblazoned with the logo of previous sponsors Audi.

One of the racing car-style Audi seats, manufactured by Recaro, sold at Bonham's for £660 when it went under the hammer in 2011.

Van Gaal also enjoys an elevated view, while at the Abbey he will be at eye-level as his men attempt to avoid a potential banana-skin at the hands of their yellow-shirted hosts.
