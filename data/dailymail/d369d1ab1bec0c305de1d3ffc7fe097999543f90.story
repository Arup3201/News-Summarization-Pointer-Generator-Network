Michelle Duggar, matriarch of the conservative Christian stars of TLC’s 19 Kids And Counting, has an older sister who is a lesbian with a long-term partner who says she worries about the reality star’s chosen lifestyle.

The relationship between Michelle’s sister and her partner has never been mentioned by the Duggars - who are quite open about their intolerance toward homosexuality - in their hit show.

In November the Duggars deleted photos of same-sex couples kissing from their official Facebook page after they had asked people to share photos, meanwhile oldest son Josh recently led an Arkansas rally protesting against gay marriage.

Michelle Duggar, matriarch of the conservative Christian stars of TLC’s 19 Kids And Counting, has an older sister, Evelyn Ruark, right, who is a lesbian with a long-term partner

Michelle’s sibling Evelyn Ruark, 63 lives with Sharon Callahan, 52, in Cincinnati, Sharon’s mother Dolores told Radar.

Just as the Duggars have issues with homosexuals so too Michelle’s family have concerns over her unusual lifestyle choices and extreme Christian beliefs.

Speaking to The National Enquirer in 2010, Sharon described herself as a ‘significant other’ of Evelyn and revealed the couple’s concerns about the Duggar family’s ties to the Quiverfull movement.

‘We are worried about them,’ Sharon said. ‘We have often thought that Quiverfull is a cult. It appears to be brainwashing to me.’

Quiverfull is a movement among some conservative evangelical Protestant couples that promotes procreation, eschews all forms of birth control and sees children as a blessing from God.

Evelyn featured in a early episode of the  reality show when the Duggar family had a get together with Michelle's siblings and her father. Sharon Callahan wasn't featured or even mentioned in the episode.

Big love: The Duggar family is a part of an evangelical Christian movement that urges women to have as many children as God gives them

Ruark and her girlfriend aren’t the only members of the Duggar’s extended family whose lifestyle is at odds with their ultra-conservative family values.

Susanna Keller, a sister of Josh Duggar’s wife Anna, is reported to have had a child outside of wedlock.

Josh, the eldest Duggar son, moved from Arkansas to DC a year and a half ago to work for the conservative lobbying group the Family Research Council, where he is an Executive Director.

The Duggars’ conservative Christian values and close-knit family has made 19 Kids and Counting one of TLC’s most successful shows.

But accusations of gay ‘fear-mongering’ appeared to threaten the reality show’s future in November, when more than 180,000 people signed a petition asking the network to end the series after anti-equality comments made by Michelle.

In August the mom had lent her star power for a campaign to strike down an ordinance that would prohibit businesses from discriminating against gender and sexual orientation.

Her voice was used in a robocall message sent to Fayetteville, Arkansas, residents that asked them to vote against the ordinance that would protect members of the gay and transgender communities.

Fallout: The Duggar matriach and her husband Jim Bob could see their hit reality series axed if petition organizers get their way

Evelyn appeared in one episode of 19 Kids and Counting where Michelle visited her Ruark relatives, but for the most part she hasn’t been featured on the show

She said: 'I don’t believe the citizens of Fayetteville would want males with past child predator convictions that claim they are female to have a legal right to enter private areas that are reserved for women and girls.'

The series had returned for ninth season in September.

The political move prompted a petition on Change.org launched by Jim Wissick to axe the show after hearing Duggar's words that he said 'reek of ignorance and fear mongering.'

He wrote on the petition page: 'Just because someone is transgendered doesn't mean they are a child predator or a rapist. The claim that this ordinance would provide predators with access to women's restrooms in order to assault or leer at girls or women is nothing more than fear-mongering and spreading ignorance and hatred.'

Supports of the Duggars have launched a rival petition to keep the show on TV, which raised over 12,000 votes.

'Many that may or may not agree with their personal beliefs, but this does not mean that they shouldn't be allowed their reality show or that they should be attacked for their personal beliefs,' the organizer wrote.

Earlier this month Michelle's husband Jim Bob Duggar said he wasn’t worried about by the petition.

'They won't succeed,' the 49-year-old said. 'Our show is the number one show on TLC. It’s a small group creating this fuss. All it has done is give us more exposure.'

He told The Pathway, an evangelical Christian publication run by the Missouri Baptist Convention, that they family gained 50,000 Facebook fans following the outcry.

Michelle Ruark was born the youngest of Garrett and Ethel Ruark’s seven children; her five sisters and brother were named Pam, Evelyn, Carol, Freda, Kathie, and Garrett Jr.

She was quite a bit younger than most of her siblings, and when the family relocated from Arkansas to Ohio in the early 80s, she stayed behind to marry Jim Bob.

There have been rumors that the Ruarks, who are not strongly religious, don’t agree with Michelle and Jim Bob’s way of life.

Evelyn has appeared in one episode of 19 Kids and Counting where Michelle visited her Ruark relatives, but for the most part she hasn’t been featured on the show
