A carriage horse suddenly collapsed on a Salt Lake City street over the weekend and since then the city has become a hotbed of arguments over whether such rides are humane.

The 13-year-old carriage horse named Jerry suffered a bout of colic on Saturday, then fell to the ground and refused to get up.

Now animal rights advocates both in and outside of Salt Lake City are calling for an end to the ‘cruel industry’ of horse drawn carriage rides.

Collapsed: A 13-year-old carriage horse named Jerry collapsed near the end of a tour in Salt Lake City on Saturday. His leg was scraped as rescuers tried to lift him from the street

Jerry was near the end of a tour when he suddenly kicked his stomach and collapsed to the ground.

‘[He] just didn’t want to move,’ city resident Ronald Schulthies told the Salt Lake Tribune. ‘His eyes were open and when we’d move him, he’d neigh and whinny.’

Schulthies was among some 60 concerned passersby. Veterinarians would also soon come to the 1,800 pound horse’s aid.

At first, all they could do was try to comfort the animal.

Stubborn: Around 60 concerned people gathered at the scene. Each time they tried to get Jerry up he 'whinnied and neighed' and refused to move

Changes? The animal reportedly suffered a bout of colic, which caused the collapse. Animal advocates are now calling for a ban on horse drawn carriage rides in the Utah city

‘It was distressing because lots of people there wanted to do something, but didn’t know what to do,’ Schulthies said. ‘Obviously, the carriage company didn’t have any plan for that type of thing.’

Schulthies said Jerry would attempt to stand but quickly fall back down. He emphasized that the horse was treated with only the utmost concern for his health and well-being.

However, the incident has animal rights advocates in a tizzy over the practice they say is unhumane.

‘These horses are trotting along on pavement, their feet are not designed to walk on pavement and their forced to pull carriages in frigid temperatures and sweltering heat,’ PETA spokesman Jeremy Beckham told KTVX. ‘It's really a recipe for injury.’

Jerry’s case has motivated animal 
lovers to call for a change to city ordinances that allow horse drawn 
carriage rides, animal lovers like Donna Pemmitt.

With demands to 'end this cruelty,' Pemmit’s online petition had received over 3,000 signatures as of Tuesday morning.

And that has city officials taking note.

‘I think anytime there’s an unfortunate incident like this, it does get everyone’s attention and it creates a dialogue that I think is good,’ said Salt Lake City councilman, who also cautioned that a change to city rules is ‘not something I take lightly.’

Jerry was eventually lifted into a trailer and quickly sedated. He’s now recovering.

Though controversy over horse carriages may be new to the Utah capital, it is nothing surprising to New York City, where the vehicles and the outcries that often surround them are common.

'It is a very inhumane and unsafe trade, particularly to be practiced in such a busy and congested city,' Elizabeth Forel, President of the Coalition to Ban Horse-Drawn Carriages told MailOnline in 2011. '[It is] unsafe to pedestrians, the passengers and the horse.'

Forel’s ire came amid several unfortunate incidents involving carriage horses in the Big Apple that year. At least three of the iconic animals collapsed in 2011, while at least one other tossed its passengers and ran wild through the streets before being sedated.
