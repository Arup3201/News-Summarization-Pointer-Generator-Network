A historic pub which is more than 700 years old and boasts views of the waterfall in Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves has gone up for sale for £675,000.

The Green Dragon Inn, in the Yorkshire Dales, is the gateway to Hardraw Force - England's highest single-drop waterfall which featured in the 1991 film starring Kevin Costner.

D Mark Thompson, who has owned the pub for more than 14 years, has now put it on the market with plans to retire.

Hardraw Force is England's highest single-drop waterfall and can only be accessed via the ancient pub

While he is selling the pub, he plans to hold onto the waterfall and the visitor centre he built nearby for the stream of tourists.

The 100ft high waterfall, used in the Robin Hood film which saw Maid Marian (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) catching Robin Hood (Kevin Costner) bathing underneath it, can only be accessed via the pub meaning film crews would have used it when filming scenes.

The pub, where English poet William Wordsworth is also said to have stayed, is nestled in the Upper Wensleydale valley, in the heart of the Yorkshire Dales National Park.

The Inn's extensive 15-acre grounds continue along Hardraw Beck taking in the spectacular narrow gorge of Hardraw Scaur.

At the head of the gorge the impressive Hardraw Force, best seen after heavy rain, drops 100 feet from an overhanging ledge.

The waterfall is open daily (10am in winter and 8am in summer) until dusk, priced £2.50 per adult and £1.50 per child.

While Mr Thompson plans to sell the pub, he wants to keep the waterfall and the nearby visitor centre

The pub, which dates back to the 13th Century, offers three interconnecting lounge bars, two dining rooms and a function room, and features include flagged floors, open fires, beamed ceilings and stone walls.

It also offers 14 letting bedrooms, boasts about 15 acres and includes a camping and caravan site.

It is on the market for £675,000 freehold or £100,000 for a new free-of-tie lease with freehold purchase option, with specialist national business agents, Davey & Co.

There is also a three-bedroom cottage and additional self-contained apartments available by separate negotiation.
