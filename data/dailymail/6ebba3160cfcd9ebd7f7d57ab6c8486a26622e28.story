Double beds could be installed in NHS maternity units to allow fathers to keep their partners company.

Hospitals will be told that, at the very least, they must offer spare beds for men who want to remain close by when mother and baby need to stay, such as after a complicated birth.

Larger birthing pools could also be provided so that fathers can join mothers during water births.

Father figure: The £25m scheme is aimed at getting men more involved with childbirth

The plans are part of a £25million scheme to get men more involved in childbirth. But the cost is likely to cause concern at a time when NHS maternity services face cutbacks across the country – while the birth rate continues to soar.

Under the proposals, hospitals will be able to bid for the money to add facilities such as double beds and larger birthing pools to their labour wards.

Health minister Dan Poulter said the scheme would help keep families together and give them more support.

He added: 'The period after a baby is born is clearly a very joyous time but it is also a very stressful time. Relationships are most likely to break up in the year after a baby.'

Dr Poulter insisted maternity units need to do more to involve fathers in childbirth and to ensure fathers are not sent away if their partner or child needs to stay in hospital. 'Hospitals need to respond to what women want, and what their families want,' he said.

'It might be a bigger birthing pool so that the mum and dad can both get in more easily – or it might be a question of providing double beds, so couples can be together when a premature baby has to stay in hospital.'

In cases where women were confined to bed because of complications, units should provide spare beds for partners who wanted to be close at hand, he added.

And he suggested funds should be devoted to providing comfort and privacy for bereaved parents, such as by making sure a woman who has lost a baby is not on the same ward as mothers with newborns.

Ministers also plan to invest in expanding the NHS Information Service for Parents, an online service to help mothers and fathers.

Dr Poulter said: 'There will now be £25million available to improve maternity facilities but not a penny of this will be given out unless there is evidence that women have been asked about the changes they want in their local areas – whether it's more ensuite facilities, overnight rooms for dads, birthing pools or other improvements.'

Cathy Warwick, chief executive of the Royal College of Midwives, said: 'Any additional money is welcome. £25million is a relatively small sum compared to the annual budget for maternity services of around £2.5billion.

'However, it will help to make changes to the environment which can improve care.'

But the RCM also warned last night that the biggest baby boom in 40 years is on its way – just as maternity cutbacks hit hospitals across the country.

The latest figures suggest more than 700,000 babies will be born in England this year, the highest number since 1971.
