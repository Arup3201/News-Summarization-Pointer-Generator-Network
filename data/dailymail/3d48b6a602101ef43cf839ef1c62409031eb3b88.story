This vertigo-inducing image shows a sheep standing on a boulder wedged 3,228 feet above a stony abyss.

While many would be quaking and grasping on for dear life, the four-legged mountaineer appears distinctly non-plussed by his precarious situation

The picture was posted on Flickr by a user called 7Ty9 and features the well-known landmark of Kjeragbolten in Rogaland, Norway.

Hope you're not a woolly jumper: This sheep was captured on film fearlessly balancing on a rock hanging over a 3,000ft drop

The boulder is wedged in a crevasse and looms over a 3,228ft drop. Flickr users were amazed at the striking image.

Tom Olliver posted: 'Fantastic shot. I don't think i'd be as brave as that sheep!'

'Nerves bristle just looking at it...!', said user William Lambton.

There has been speculation that the image is faked, with some internet users saying a sheep could never get up there.

Others, however, have pointed out that sheep can be quite nimble in mountainous areas.

The picture features the boulder Kjeragbolten in Rogaland, Norway

Whether it is Photoshopped or not, Flickr user Wimper summed up the image well. He said: 'Fake or not, extremely shockingly good! Fantastic!!!'

The boulder was deposited during the last glacial period, at around 50,000BC. It was wedged into its current position after being suspended in the ice as a glacier melted. It is a popular tourist spot and often sought out by daredevil base jumpers.
