With phone handsets constantly evolving and the need for connectivity increasing, it can be difficult to make an informed decision as to which mobile to choose for your lifestyle.

Phone handsets can also be expensive, both to buy outright, or over a provider's phone plan, which might be convenient, but could see you forking out more than the retail price.

With the 5.5 inch 16GB Apple iPhone 6 retailing from $999 and the 5.1 inch  16GB Samsung Galaxy S5 retailing from $778, it comes as a surprise that a new handset is breaking into the smartphone market retailing for only $99.

The Boost View 5.0 is targeted at a younger demographic who are conscious of finances but want the best possible phone on which to take photos and engage on social media

Marketing itself as the first 5 inch handset for under $100, the brand new Boost Mobile Alcatel One Touch View 5.0 is set to hit the market this week, and Daily Mail Australia set out to compare how the budget phone compares to the much more expensive handsets. 

The Boost View 5.0 is targeted at a younger demographic who are conscious of finances but want the best possible phone on which to take photos and engage on social media.

'However, consumers are fed up of being charged significantly more to purchase them than in other countries. We want to offer people a top spec phone, perfect for social media sharing, at an affordable price,' Mr Blackhall said. 

Daily Mail Australia spoke to Stephen Fenech, editor of Tech Guide, to see how the Alcatel One Touch stacked up against it's Apple and Samsung counterparts.

‘Australians love smartphones, usage figures are amongst the highest in the world per capita and we spend around 2 hours on them each day,' said Ian Blackhall, Chief Marketing Officer of Boost Mobile

'The iPhone and Samsung products are far more expensive because they have brighter, larger and much higher resolution screens along with processors that are twice as fast and superior cameras plus they offer top shelf features like fingerprint recognition and productivity features like multitasking,' Stephen said

'Comparing the $99 Alcatel OneTouch phone to the iPhone and Samsung is like comparing a Hyundai to a Ferrari - they both do kind of the same thing but the Ferrari has a much nicer design, is faster, sleeker and all the bells and whistles,' Stephen said.

The tech expert said that the Alcatel One Touch has lower specifications than the iPhone 6 and Samsung Galaxy S, with 4GB of internal storage, 5 megapixel camera, a 5-inch screen with a resolution of 854 x 480 and a 1.3Ghz quad core processor.

'These customers can’t afford the iPhone or top-of-the-line Samsungs, as usually younger users who are buying their first smartphone. However, the phone still offers value to pre-paid customers,' Stephen said. 

The Boost Mobile Alcatel One Touch is available on the Telstra 3G Mobile Network with Boost’s $40 Unlimited monthly offer, and most phone networks offer bring-your-own handset deals.

Telstra offers a Mobile Accelerate Plan BYO $45 per month for other handsets, Optus offers a comparable $35 BYO plan, and Vodafone offers a $30 BYO plan. 

'Comparing the $99 Alcatel OneTouch phone to the iPhone and Samsung is like comparing a Hyundai to a Ferrari - they both do kind of the same thing but the Ferrari has a much nicer design, is faster, sleeker and all the bells and whistles,' said Stephen

'The iPhone and Samsung products are far more expensive because they have brighter, larger and much higher resolution screens along with processors that are twice as fast and superior cameras (iPhone 6 has an eight megapixel - and Samsung Galaxy S5 has a 16 megapixel camera) plus they offer top shelf features like fingerprint recognition and productivity features like multitasking. In the case of the Samsung Galaxy S5 it is also waterproof!' Stephen said.

These pointers don't mean that the $99 smartphone isn't great value, however.

Stephen labelled the One Touch 'excellent value', as it still offers the experience most users are looking for, as they can enjoy content on the go on the larger 5-inch screen, connect to social media and take pictures with the built-in camera.  

'No it’s not an iPhone or Samsung phone but the Boost Mobile $99 phone still punches well above its weight,' Stephen determined.
