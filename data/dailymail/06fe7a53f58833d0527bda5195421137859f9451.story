Paul Kohler, pictured, was assaulted at his home in Wimbledon, south west London on Monday

A lawyer beaten to a pulp by four masked men inside his £2 million London home said he could not stop thinking about his wife and daughter despite the horrendous nature of his injuries.

Speaking for the first time since the attack, Paul Kohler from Wimbledon, south west London said he was almost blinded within moments of the attack, but tried to land his own punches to protect his family.  

Academic Mr Kohler revealed the gang, who spoke with an Eastern European accent, kept asking 'Where’s the money?' during the home invasion. 

He said: 
'The first punch in the hall took my eye out, I thought I had lost the 
eye at that stage because it stopped functioning.

'But I just kept thinking of my wife and daughter and her boyfriend upstairs.

'They got me on the floor but I managed to stand up and at one stage and trade blows with them.'

Mr Kohler told the Evening Standard: 'I got a few blows in, but these were thumps like I never had in my life - they could really punch.'

Police are now investigating whether the attack was linked to a cabaret bar Mr Kohler, 55, owns in central London. 

Detectives
 searching two men who assaulted an academic and bar owner inside his 
own home on Monday have released new CCTV footage of one of the 
suspects. 

Father-of-four Paul Kohler, 55, was beaten by four masked men at his home in Wimbledon, south west London at 10pm on Monday. 

Police are currently searching for two men in connection with the assault, who escaped from the scene on foot.

Two other men were arrested after the attack and have been charged with grevious bodily harm and aggravated burglary.

His brother, Marcus Kohler, a charity worker from Cambridge, said: 'Paul is an incredibly strong man.

'The vision in his left eye is coming back and doctors are confident his sight will improve.

'His face has been so swollen he hasn't been able to have surgery yet.

'The hospital were going to let him out yesterday but he's had to have a blood transfusion because his haemoglobin is so low.

'We just want to get him home again but I think he might stay now until surgery as the swelling is going down.

'He never lost consciousness so has been able to speak to his family in hospital.

'We are determined to get through this and not let what happened change us..

'You can't help but be a bit paranoid now though.

'Samantha and his daughters are doing OK. It's been hard for us but we are not losing hope.

'He'll be OK eventually, we just need to find out how this happened and see those other two men arrested.'

One
 of the remaining suspects fled down King's Road towards Wimbledon town 
centre. He was spotted crossing the car park of Wimbledon Theatre a few 
minutes after the attack. 

It is not known which direction the final man went.

The third suspect removed 'surgical gloves' worn during the attack as he crossed through the theatre's car park. 

The two remaining men are believed to be from Eastern Europe, possibly Poland and are in their 20s or 30s.

Officers are also seeking information on a silver-coloured Volkswagen convertible which may have been used by the gang.

Detective Inspector Dan O'Sullivan, of Merton Burglary Squad, said: 'This new piece of CCTV is crucial in the identification of one of the outstanding suspects, and we are calling to anyone who recognises this man to come forward.

'It is my firm belief that this man and his other outstanding associate, would have been stained with blood spatter from the violent attack inside the house. 

'Both were also wearing white surgical gloves when they fled. Whilst they attempted a quick exit, I'm sure that members of the public would have seen them.

'The victim currently remains in hospital and is awaiting surgery to an extreme eye injury which has lead to the fracture of his socket. 

Police believe that passing motorists may have spotted one of the suspects, pictured, fleeing the scene 

Detective Inspector Dan O'Sullivan believes that the men will have been covered in 'blood spatter' 

The attackers repeatedly asked Mr Kohler where he kept the money during Monday's burglary 

Detective Inspector O'Sullivan continued: 'The level of violence used is unprecedented for this borough and we believe that the motive for this horrendous crime is purely for financial gain, and the attackers thought there was cash within the property. 

'We continue to appeal for information regarding a silver car the suspects may have used. 'I must stress that this appears to be an isolated incident, and such cases are thankfully rare. 

'However, this serious attack is now subject of a meticulous enquiry whilst we work to support individuals affected by the events and the local community. 

'Officers are currently conducting high visibility patrols and speaking to residents to answer their concerns.'

Two men have so far appeared in court in connection with the incident. Polish nationals Pawel Honc, 23, of no fixed abode and Mariusz Tomaszewski, 32, from Tooting in south London both appeared at Wimbledon Magistrates' Court where they were charged with aggravated burglary and grevious bodily harm. 

Both were remanded to reappear at Kingston Crown Court on August 27.

At the time of the attack Mr Kohler and his wife Samantha were playing a board game with their daughter Eloise and her boyfriend. 

Moments before the gang approached, Eloise and the boyfriend went to her room, where they locked themselves in as they heard the shouting and dialed 999.

Earlier Detective Inspector O'Sullivan described the attack as the most brutal assault he has seen in more than 20 years of policing.  

Detectives believe Monday night’s robbery – as the family played a board game – was well-planned and targeted but are perplexed by the motive behind the ultra-violent attack.

One line of inquiry is that Mr Kohler, who is head of law at the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London, is the victim of mistaken identity or that the gang simply struck at the wrong house.

Mr
 Kohler runs the Cellar Door bar in Central London with his wife 
Samantha, centre, and business partner Gordon Anderson. The popular 
venue is located in a converted underground toilet frequented by Oscar 
Wilde

DI O'Sullivan said: 'The victim and his family are distraught and they cannot understand why they were targeted in this way. We believe that the motive for this horrendous crime is purely for financial gain, and the attackers thought there was cash within the property.

'The level of violence used is unprecedented for this borough, and I'm appealing to anyone who was in the area between 21:00-23:00hrs to come forward and speak to us if they heard or saw anything suspicious. We are also seeking information regarding a silver car the suspects may have used.

'The fast response to the 999 call ensured that two suspects were apprehended and the victim could receive immediate first aid.

'I must stress that this appears to be an isolated incident, and such cases are thankfully rare. However, this serious attack is now subject of a meticulous enquiry whilst we work to support individuals affected by the events and the local community. Officers are currently conducting high visibility patrols and speaking to residents to answer their concerns.'

He will have to have further reconstructive surgery to repair a shattered eye socket and forehead.

Mr Kohler’s wife Samantha MacArthur described the attackers as ‘cowardly and wicked’ and praised her husband’s bravery.

The couple married in April in Jesus College Cambridge where their four daughters were bridesmaids.

Miss MacArthur, 50, said: ‘This was just totally pointless and totally cruel and cowardly. What sort of men, covering their heads, hold a man down and just beat him for no reason?’

‘He is amazingly brave. Three men were beating him up and he didn’t stop. He fought the whole way and I’m sure if he hadn’t it would have been a lot worse for all of us. It was incredibly traumatic and we are very angry and upset. We have no idea what has happened. We have no reason.’ 

Mr Kohler runs the Cellar Door bar in Aldwych, central London, with Gordon Anderson, who told the Daily Telegraph that he had no idea why his colleague was set upon.

He told the newspaper: 'Paul is a beautiful human being. I can't understand how anyone could do this to him.'

The 52-year-old explained that the bar was part of the London cabaret and drag seen and that the venture was 'successful and fun'.

Asked whether he believed the assault may have been linked to the bar in some way, he added: 'I have no idea. That is a matter for the police.'

Anyone with information is urged to call the incident room on 020 8649 3159; Or if you with to remain anonymous call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
