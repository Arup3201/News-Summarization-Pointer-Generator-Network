Thousands of workers blacklisted by construction firms are to receive up to £100,000 each in compensation, it emerged today.

More than 3,200 names, mainly of building workers, were kept on the list, drawn up by a shadowy organisation called The Consulting Association.

Workers launched legal action after finding they were denied work, often after raising concerns about health and safety on building sites.

Last month eight firms announced that they are working together to develop a scheme to compensate construction workers whose names were on database.

Now it has emerged that initial offers range from £1,000 to as much as £100,000 per worker, according to the Financial Times.

The revelation comes amid a coalition row over plans to investigate separate reports of union intimidation linked to the Grangemouth oil refinery dispute in Falkirk.

The Tories said the QC-led inquiry would focus on the Unite’s tactic of sending mobs of demonstrators to protest outside the homes of company directors.

But Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg insisted it would look at all rogue practices, by unions and employers alike.

The Lib Dem leader said: ‘This is a short independent inquiry looking at irresponsible behaviour of both trade unions and businesses.

‘I'm a huge supporter of the way in which responsible trade unions and responsible businesses have actually maintained strikingly good... industrial relations during the recent years. But there are some irresponsible trade unions... and there are some irresponsible business practices, unacceptable ones such as blacklisting.

‘And this inquiry, run independently of government, will look at it in the round.’

Eight firms have set up a compensation fund to recompense more than 3,200 people who were unable to get work

News of the first offers to workers who were blacklisted comes ahead of a TUC day of action on Wednesday against the practice.

The Consulting Association was closed down following a raid on its West Midlands offices by the Information Commissioner’s Office.

But unions said workers continued to be discriminated against if their names were on the list.

A total of 44 firms were found to be using the blacklist. The names of a number of environmental activists were also included.

The Construction Workers Compensation Scheme was launched by eight companies: Balfour Beatty, Carillion, Costain, Kier, Laing O’Rourke, Sir Robert McAlpine, Skanska UK and VINCI PLC.

In a statement last month they said: ‘The companies all apologise for their involvement with TCA and the impact that its database may have had on any individual construction worker.

'The companies have joined together to establish the Construction Workers Compensation Scheme.

'The scheme is intended to make it as simple as possible for any worker with a legitimate claim to access compensation.

'The companies have invited workers’ representatives to enter into a period of engagement to ensure that the proposed terms of the scheme are fair and effective. The group is also engaging with other interested parties.’
