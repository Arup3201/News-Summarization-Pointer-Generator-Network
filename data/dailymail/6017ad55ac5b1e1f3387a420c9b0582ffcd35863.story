Surplus to requirements: Jon Obi Mikel will be allowed to leave Chelsea this summer

Meanwhile, Chelsea defender Tamas Kalas has joined Cologne on loan.

The young Czech, who has also had two season-long loan spells with Vitesse Arnhem, made his debut for the Blues last campaign.

However, he will hook up with the German outfit next term to gain regular first-team football.

Staying put: Jose Mourinho will block any move for star man Eden Hazard

Elsewhere, Jose Mourinho says Eden Hazard will not be allowed to leave Chelsea.

He said: 'Just because I say that Eden does not have everything, it doesn't mean I don't want him.

'For him, as for others, the door is closed. People who know me know that, when I say that, I mean it.'
