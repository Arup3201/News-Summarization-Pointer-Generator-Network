Michael Kopeski, 27, is alleged to have stolen a police car and taunted officers over its radio

A man allegedly stole a police car and taunted officers over the radio after they were called to a domestic dispute he was involved in.

Officers were called to the Massachusetts home of Michael Kopeski's girlfriend at around 4am yesterday after she asked police to remove the 27-year-old from her premises. 

Sergeant John Delaney said at first Kopeski was cooperative with officers Shelley Whitley and Christopher Roberts, but that changed when he wanted to re-enter the property on Laurelton Street, Pine Point, to gather his possessions.

Kopeski was then said to have called the officers 'pigs', before spitting on their patrol car.

Sgt. Delaney said Kopeski then pulled on the driver's side door of the car which opened despite an automatic lock being engaged.  He then got in and drove away.

One of the officers managed to open the passenger door of the vehicle and pepper spray Kopeski, but Sgt. Delaney told Masslive.com it had no effect on the 'possessed driver'.

For the next 20 minutes Kopeski taunted police over the car's radio, saying things like 'You guys are boring, I am going to find crime'. 

He was also said to have disrupted radio transmissions as he drove around Springfield streets.

Police boxed the vehicle in but Kopeski refused to surrender. Officers then broke a window to get into the vehicle and arrest him.

Kopeski was said to have thrown punches at the officers, two of which were injured in the altercation, before he was subdued. 

Sgt Delaney said: 'Mr. Kopeski then got another ride in a police car, this time in the rear seat, cuffed'.

He was later charged with larceny of a motor vehicle, failure to stop for police, four counts of assault and battery on a police officer and resisting arrest.

Sgt. Delaney said such incidents are rare but not unheard of, saying 'It has happened before'.
