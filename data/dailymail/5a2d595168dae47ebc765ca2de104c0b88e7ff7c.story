A six-year-old boy who suffers from a neuromuscular condition had a birthday to remember on Sunday when he got to be a Navy SEAL for the day.

Mason Rudder, from Kansas City, was in his element as he spent the day going through weapons and explosives training before getting to fire a gun and blow something up.

The whole experience was a dream coming true for Mason who wants to be a Navy SEAL when he grows up.

The whole experience was a dream coming true for Mason who wants to be a Navy SEAL when he grows up

According to Mason’s father, George, his son’s fascination with the SEALs was partly fueled by the fact his uncle was a SEAL and his grandfather was in the Air Force.

Mason enjoys playing military games around the house and so his parents arranged the Navy SEAL For A Day training as a birthday surprise. ‘He’s all boy,’ his father told the St Louis Post-Dispatch.

Mason was born with a genetic disorder (Escobar syndrome) that causes limited movement and a decreased range of motion.

He is about 3½ feet tall and weighs just 32 pounds and had already endured 10 surgeries. His older sister, Haley, 7, also has the disorder; while their brother, Collin, 9, doesn’t.

The young boy helped his team enter the lair by detonating a real bomb similar to ones used in the 2011 mission to capture Osama bin Laden at his compound in Pakistan

Mason was trained on Sunday by ex-Navy SEAL Jared Ogden who offers training to military service members and the police.

He helped Mason hold several high-powered rifles and handguns, then Mason’s final ‘mission’ was to raid the hideout of a Taliban leader.

The young boy helped his team enter the lair by detonating a real bomb similar to ones used in the 2011 mission to capture Osama bin Laden at his compound in Pakistan.

Mason said that detonating the bomb was his favorite part of the entire training day.

At the end of training, Ogden pinned a Navy Seal trident on the young boy’s sweatshirt.

In his final mission, Mason got to stick the explosives on the door of the building
