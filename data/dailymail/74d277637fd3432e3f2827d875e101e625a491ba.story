Sol Campbell's desire to become a politician has taken a step further after it was revealed that he has been urged to stand for London Mayor in 2016.

The 40-year-old former England international is wanted by senior Conservative MPs to replace Boris Johnson in a year's time when the process begins after the General Election in May.

Campbell met Tory chairman Grant Shapps in December to discuss possible candidacy but speaking to the Sun he admitted a decision has yet to be made on his behalf.

However, the ex-Tottenham and Arsenal defender did outline his intentions as London Mayor if he did stand for that position.

'We'll see what happens. A few conversations have to take place,' he said.

'I'm London through and through. It's about getting more of the wealth in central London to help the boroughs.'

Stratford-born Campbell also believes there should be more ethnic minorities represented in Parliament.

At present there are 27 black and ethnic minority MPs - a figure around 100 short to be representative of the 18 per cent within the British population.

'The voters need to see someone with who can connect with them,' he added.

Campbell won eight trophies during his playing career with six different clubs - including two Premier League titles and three FA Cups with Arsenal.

The centre back also made 73 appearances for his country, scoring once.
