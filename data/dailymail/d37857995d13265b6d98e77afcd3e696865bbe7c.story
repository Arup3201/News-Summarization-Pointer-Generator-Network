After a teammate's knee put a dent in his face during a game against the Portland Trailblazers two days ago, Oklahoma City Thunder guard Russell Westbrook had successful facial surgery today.

The surgery repaired a fracture to the zygomatic arch of the NBA star's right cheek.

Westbrook, who is averaging 26.5 points, 8.1 assists and 6.8 rebounds in 45 games this season, is not expected to be sidelined for long.

The 26-year-old sustained the facial injury when his teammate Andre Roberson ran into him while trying to find a Portland player to foul and stop the clock. 

There were two-and-a-half seconds remaining  when Roberson kneed Westbrook in the face and the Thunder went on to lose 115-112.

His surgery was performed by doctors at the Osborne Head and Neck Institute in Los Angeles, California. 

The zygomatic arch bone separates the eye socket from the sinuses, according to ESPN.

Westbrook, 26, is averaging 26.5 points, 8.1 assists and 6.8 rebounds in 45 games for OKC this season

Medical analyst Mark Edickes said: 'There are bacteria in the sinuses, so it is a bone that needs to be fixed.

'There are a lot of facial bones you may crack that don't need to be fixed. 

'The other thing is, it provides some contour to the cheek, so there is an issue of appearance as well.'

When he resumes playing, Westbrook will probably wear a face mask.  

Westbrook did not play in OKC's 108-101 win over the Los Angeles Lakers earlier today.

He will be  re-evaluated this week to determine when he can return to the court, although Yahoo Sports reported if Westbrook 'had a playoff game, he could play'.

Westbrook has recorded three straight triple-doubles.

DJ Augustin started in place of Westbrook against the Lakers.
