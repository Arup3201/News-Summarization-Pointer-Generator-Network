Dominique Strauss-Kahn was released from house arrest in New York yesterday as the sexual assault case against him teetered on the verge of collapse.

A dramatic court hearing in Manhattan saw the French former head of the International Monetary Fund given back his £3.7million bail money.

A security tag on his ankle was also removed.

Prosecutors admitted there were ‘serious credibility issues’ with his accuser, a maid who said he tried to rape her in May at the Manhattan hotel where she worked.

All smiles: The credibility of the witness led to Strauss-Kahn being released from house arrest

Law enforcement officials believe the  32-year-old Guinean immigrant has repeatedly lied to them and may have links to drug dealing and money laundering.

Assistant District Attorney Joan Illuzzi-Orbon told the court: ‘It’s clear that the strength of this case has been affected by substantial credibility issues with the witness.’

Strauss-Kahn, 62, who denies attempted rape and serious sexual assault, left the court smiling and with his arm around his wife, Anne Sinclair, after a judge lifted his stringent bail conditions. He had been held in a Manhattan house under armed guard.

Judge Michael Obus acknowledged that the risk of Strauss-Kahn absconding ‘had receded quite a bit’ but said he was ‘in no rush to judgment’ on the case.

The charges have not yet been dismissed and the court will hold on to Strauss-Kahn’s passport.

But, in a stunning reversal in the case, the spotlight has shifted to his accuser.

She claims Strauss-Kahn subjected her to a vicious sex attack when she came to clean his suite at the Sofitel hotel, telling investigators he was naked and chased her across the room.

Forensic tests have revealed the pair definitely had a sexual encounter, but defence lawyers have claimed it was consensual.

While public opinion has so far weighed heavily against Strauss-Kahn, who has a reputation as an aggressive womaniser, the maid’s lawyer had portrayed her as a hard-working single mother and devout Muslim.

But according to law enforcement officials who spoke to the New York Times, that image appears to be very far from the truth.

Two official sources said the unnamed woman spoke on the telephone to an imprisoned alleged drug dealer within a day of her encounter with Strauss-Kahn.

In the conversation, which was recorded, she reportedly discussed the possible benefits of pursuing the charges against Strauss-Kahn.

Investigators also say they learnt that the man on the other end of the phone, who is accused of possessing 400lb of marijuana, is among several people who put cash deposits amounting to more than £62,000 into the maid’s bank account over the past two years.

In addition, the woman has been paying hundreds of dollars each month in phone charges to five companies even though she told police she had only one phone.

She allegedly told officials that she  knew only that the deposits were made by a man she described as her fiancé and his friends.

Prosecutors also say they discovered inconsistencies in her account of her past life. She is said to have lied about details on her application for asylum in the U.S., including saying she had been gang-raped by soldiers in Guinea.

Investigators said they also  found a discrepancy between her account of how she had been subjected to genital mutilation and the version she had provided in her asylum application.

In a letter to the court Miss Illuzzi-Orbon laid out in detail the problems with the alleged victim.

In her application for asylum to the U.S. for herself and her daughter in 2004 she said that the home she shared with her husband in Guinea was burned by soldiers for the country’s regime.

Her husband was then supposedly tortured in jail where he died of his injuries.According to prosecutors she later admitted this was a lie.

Prosecutors also said that she cried when she recounted to them the story from her asylum application of how she had been gang-raped in Guinea, but later admitted that this was also a lie.

She also allegedly owned up to falsely claiming a friend’s child as her own to get a higher tax refund, and misrepresenting her income to stay in her present home. Her lawyer, Kenneth Thompson, admitted outside court that her asylum application was ‘not completely accurate’ but accused New York’s district attorney of deserting his client because he was scared of losing such a high profile case.

He also said suggestions his client was involved in drug dealing were a ‘lie’ and claimed the maid’s daughter had told him that prosecutors had ‘mistreated’ and ‘screamed at’ her mother while interviewing her.

Although prosecutors have revealed their doubts about the maid, they stressed they have not necessarily changed their mind about the charges against Strauss-Kahn.
