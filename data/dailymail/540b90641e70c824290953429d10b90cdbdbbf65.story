As temperatures soared in Brazil, there must have been only one man who was so cool he needed a cardigan.

But former Arsenal player Thierry Henry found himself the subject of praise for his stylish choice of knitwear.

While his BBC colleagues Alan Shearer and Rio Ferdinand went for open-necked plain white shirts, Henry opted instead to wrap up in a blue cardigan.

The Arsenal legend has been lauded on 
social media for his sartorial insouciance as he brought his unique 
brand of ‘va-va-voom’ to the studio.

Sports presenter Clare Balding wrote online: ‘I like Thierry Henry’s cardigan very much. That is the limit of my football analysis.’

And Andy Weltch, a writer from Cardiff, tweeted: ‘The thing I like most about this BBC coverage? Thierry Henry’s cardigan. It’s lovely.’

And it wasn’t just the Frenchman’s fashion sense that was picked up on either - many appreciated his silky voice too.

Sonia
 Lowis, a student at the University of London, tweeted: ‘Thierry Henry’s
 voice is like a hot chocolate by the fireplace in a rich mans library 
in a cold December night.'

Henry even remained cool when host 
Gary Lineker brought up his infamous handball against Ireland in the 
World Cup play-off in 2009 – which many believe cost the Irish their 
place at the finals.

When 
Lineker knowingly asked ‘Ever get away with a handball Thierry?’, an 
unruffled Henry laughed off the comment and replied ‘no, never’.

Those hoping to recreate Henry’s style however may need to start saving – the knitted-silk cardigan from Gucci costs an eye-watering £505.
