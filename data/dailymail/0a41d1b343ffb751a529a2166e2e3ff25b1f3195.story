If you've ever struggled to find a restroom or been appalled at the state of public facilities, a new app could come to the rescue.

Called Airpnp, it allows people to rent out their restroom for between $3-$5 per visit.

Owners wanting to list their facilities must post pictures, and even specify the type of toilet paper they have - with some offering a range to choose from.

The app offer restrooms around the world, and is extremely popular in Europe

The app started life at the New Orleans Mardi Gras - but has now expanded globally.

The founders said the site was inspired by their tribulations when 
attending New Orleans's Mardi Gras festival and being unable to find a 
bathroom.

'This problem is often solved by using what is known as a 'rogue pee',' they explain.

'If caught the person faces a weekend in Orleans Parish Prison.

'Yet this stiff penalty doesn’t stop thousands upon thousands of 'rogue pees' -  and this clearly demonstrates the demand for a legal alternative.'

One New York listing offers the chance to pet a dog while using the facilities

The firm's advertising positions it as an alternative to festival toilets

Around 400 bathrooms have signed up for the service, from Korea to Colombia - and still has many in New Orleans.

'Clean bathroom in our uptown home,' reads one.

'Toilet paper and hand soap provided, of course. Large mirror for checking yourself out.'

Another advert offers a 'porcelain paradise' just off the main parade route in New Orleans, for $3 per visit.The advert reads: 'Imagine, you, gazing at passing floats. Now imagine you gazing at more floats just a few minutes later.

'Because that's all it will take for you to unleash your bowels in our frequently cleaned porcelain paradise.'

One user in Union Square in New York even offers to let visitors pet her dog while using the facilities - although one commenter claims the animal relieved itself on them.

'Small dog is in-house,' the ad reads.

'Visitors can play with her if they like while friend is in the stall.'

Another ad in south Korea admits 'It's not spacious to dance, but enough to pee.'

'You can recharge your phone while you are peeing.'
