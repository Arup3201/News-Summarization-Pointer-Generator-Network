A British couple from Leeds got their Hollywood happy ending after getting engaged on stage - with a little help from Arnold Schwarzenegger.

Schwarzenegger, who is famous for his roles in blockbusters such Predator and The Terminator, later posted a video of the proposal online. 

The clip, which has now attracted over 30,000 hits, opens with a voiceover from the star, in which he says: 'This was a first. Spoiler: She said yes. Congratulations! I wish you the best'.

The couple, Dean Goulding, 29, and Jessica Eddy, 25, were called to the stage by Mr Schwarzenegger, who  was making an appearance in Leeds at a charity event.

In the video, Mr Goulding then gets down on one knee and pops the question to Miss Eddy, as the former Governor of California looks on.

Mr Schwarzenegger then embraces the happy couple, as Elland Road, Leeds United's football ground, erupts into cheers.

Speaking afterwards, Miss Eddy told of her disbelief at the surprise proposal and her admiration for the Terminator star. 

'I still can't believe it, I'm so shocked,' said the delighted bride-to-be. 'It feels like I'm in a dream.

'Arnie comes across the funniest person and seems so grounded and really kind-hearted - and what he did for us really shows that.'

Miss Eddy, a receptionist at the local university, has been dating Mr Goulding, a physical trainer employed by the Navy, for six years. 

This is the moment a couple perfected their Hollywood ending - after getting engaged on stage with Arnold Schwarzenegger at a charity event hosted by Jonathan Ross

She added: 'I'm a massive Arnie fan but Dean's the one who has lots of pictures of him round the house!'

Mr Goulding, who is currently in the process of moving to Bahrain for six months for work, said: 'It was amazing. He's my idol!'

During his two-hour set, which was hosted by Jonathan Ross, Mr Schwarzenegger talked movies, bodybuilding and politics.

The actor and politician appeared in Leeds last Friday for one of only two UK appearances, and paid tribute to Reg Park, the Leeds United reserve player whom went on to be crowned Mr Universe and starred in Hercules movies.

'It's wonderful to be back in Leeds,' Mr Schwarzenegger, 67, told the crowd. 'For me it's kind of emotional coming here because my idol Reg Park was born in Leeds.

'He was one of the best bodybuilders of all time and is one of the people who was most inspirational for me.'

Speaking about his impressive career, he said: 'It is a dream come true. I want to let people know that anyone can do it. Anyone of us is a champion.'

Mr Schwarzenegger also helped auction an array of movie memorabilia, raising thousands of pounds for Leeds-based Candlelighters and Global's Make Some Noise Charity.

He even coughed up £15,000 to buy one of the lots himself - a mosaic of the Terminator. 

The Terminator, posted a video of the proposal online - which has had over 30,000 hits - saying: 'This was a first. Spoiler: She said yes. Congratulations! I wish you the best"
