A squad mate of a Marine sergeant who allegedly killed unarmed women and children in Iraq told a court he would have called in an air strike to level the house if he could do it again.

Former Sergeant Hector Salinas testified in a military court that he believed small arms fire had come from the direction of the home shortly after a roadside bomb hit a convoy, killing a Marine.

He was testifying at the court-martial of Staff Sergeant Frank Wuterich at Camp Pendleton in California about when the group gunned down six people, including a man in a wheelchair.

But Salinas conceded he did not know at the time there were women and children inside.

Charged: Wuterich is the last defendant in one of the biggest criminal cases against U.S. troops from the Iraq war

Wuterich, the squad leader, faces nine
counts of manslaughter and other charges stemming from Marine actions 
that day that killed 24 Iraqis in the town of Haditha in 2005.

The Marines stormed two homes for 45 
minutes, killing unarmed men, women and children. They found no weapons 
or insurgents, squad members testified.

Salinas testified that he was the 
first Marine to enter the house after the roadside bomb exploded. He 
said he shot a figure he saw near the stairs and later learned he had 
killed an elderly woman.

He said he saw the man in a wheelchair after he went back to the home later. Four other unarmed civilians were killed there.

Asked by a defence attorney if he 
would have done anything differently that day, Salinas said: ‘I would 
have just utilised my air to just level the house’.

Wuterich's lawyers have said their client believed insurgents were in the home after the explosion.

Military prosecutors have implicated 
him in 19 of the 24 Iraqi deaths. The Marine from Connecticut is the 
last defendant in one of the biggest criminal cases against U.S. troops 
from the war.

One squad member was acquitted. Six 
others had their cases dropped. Salinas was never formally charged. He 
was one of two squad members who testified on Thursday.

Both raised questions about testimony 
given on Wednesday by another fellow Marine who said Wuterich had called
for bloodshed of Iraqis if his squad ever was hit by a roadside bomb.

The deadly attack known as the Haditha massacre occurred on November 19, 2005, led to the deaths of 24 Iraqis in total.

Seven of them were children.

The killings are considered among the Iraq war's defining moments, further tainting the U.S.’s reputation when it was already at a low point after the release of photos of prisoner abuse by U.S. soldiers at Abu Ghraib prison.

Sgt Frank Wuterich is the last of the eight Marines initially accused of murder or failure to investigate the killings to face trial.

Six others had their charges either dropped or dismissed, and one was acquitted.

A full investigation didn't begin until a Time magazine reporter inquired about the deaths in January 2006, two months after the incident.

The story behind the killings was retold in Nick Broomfield's 2007 film Battle for Haditha.

Salinas said he did not recall this - and former Lance Corporal Trent Graviss said he never heard it.

Salinas and Graviss also said they did
not hear or recall hearing Wuterich ask them to lie about what happened
that day, as Sergeant Sanick Dela Cruz testified on Wednesday.

Salinas and Graviss told the 
all-Marine jury that they did not believe Dela Cruz to be a truthful 
person, and that they considered Wuterich to be a good Marine.

The issue at the court martial is 
whether Wuterich reacted appropriately as a Marine squad leader in 
protecting his troops in the midst of a chaotic war.

Or if he went on a vengeful rampage, 
disregarding combat rules and leading his men to shoot and blast 
indiscriminately at Iraqi civilians.

Prosecutors in their opening statement
painted a picture of a young Marine with no prior combat experience 
losing control after seeing his friend's body blown apart.

Prosecutor Major Nicholas Gannon said 
the evidence will show Wuterich ‘made a series of fatal assumptions and 
he lost control of himself’.

Wuterich has said he regretted the loss of civilian lives but believed he was operating within military combat rules.

The squad was returning from a supply run at a combat outpost when one of the four humvees in their convoy hit a roadside bomb, killing Lance Cpl Miguel Terrazas and wounding two others.

Corporal Steven Tatum said he rushed to help someone trapped under the humvee when he heard small arms fire hit the vehicle in front. Wuterich and another Marine ran toward the nearest home.

Tatum testified that when he caught up to Wuterich, the sergeant told him to 'treat the house as hostile'. Tatum said he understood that to mean there were armed individuals inside.

He believed he did not need to 
identify his target to attack. The Marines tossed grenades in rooms and 
fired off rounds. One man was killed near the kitchen.

Others were killed in a back room, 
where Tatum fired alongside Wuterich but said he was unable to see what 
he was shooting at because of the darkness and flying debris after a 
grenade exploded.

The Marines left when someone yelled 
that they had seen a person running out of the home. They ran to a 
neighbouring house, tossing grenades in rooms and shooting off rounds.

Tatum saw the body of an Iraqi man 
near the kitchen when he went in after his fellow men. While checking a 
room, he said he heard people in a nearby room moving then Wuterich 
firing his M-16.

'Military jurors may say, look tens of thousands of us went to war zones and didn't kill civilians. But they may also be willing to consider the fact that the individual may have been caught in the fog of war'

He returned later when the house had 
been determined to be safe and learned they had killed an unarmed woman 
and children in the room.

Legal experts say military 
prosecutors face an uphill battle trying to prove, so many years later, 
that Wuterich's actions were criminal.

'Military jurors may say, look tens 
of thousands of us went to war zones and didn't kill civilians,’ said 
former Navy officer David Glazier, a professor at Loyola Law School in 
Los Angeles.

‘But they may also be willing to consider the fact that the individual may have been caught in the fog of war.’
