Ally McCoist paid tribute to his players for ignoring the off-field dramas and fan protests that continue to engulf the Ibrox club to secure a much-needed win. Rangers had to come from behind twice to see off the challenge of an impressive Queen of the South side and keep up with Championship leaders Hearts.

Once again, events away from the pitch this week grabbed the headlines, with the board launching a new shares issue in a desperate bid to raise funds.

And there was a mild fans’ protest too when a section of the Broomloan Road Stand held up red cards and chanted: ‘Sack the board’.

Amid this sideshow, goals from Marius Zaliukas, David Templeton, Bilel Mohsni and Kenny Miller won the match for McCoist’s men.

‘I have to say I congratulate my players for the last two or three years,’ said the Ibrox boss. ‘If they have wanted an excuse or to look over their shoulders for an issue or two that’s been happening around the club or involving the club, there’s been massive opportunity for them to do that. They haven’t done it.

‘You have just got to blank (fans’ protests) it out. It can’t become an issue because if we lose track or focus on the job we have to do, then the game’s a bogey.

‘We can’t allow it to affect us. It’s easy to say that, but doing it is a different thing and up until now, our lads deserve a lot of credit in their focus on getting results for this football club.’

The latest dire predictions of financial doom were indeed placed to one side in an entertaining encounter.

Lead: Gavin Reilly slotted the Queen of the South ahead after 22 minutes as Rangers struggled to get going

While the latest share issue and the implications it could have were it to be under-subscribed stole the headlines in the build-up to this encounter, McCoist wouldn’t have needed to be told of the seriousness of the situation on the park had Queens held on to their advantage and Rangers had fallen six points behind leaders Hearts already.

After Zaliukas had netted in between goals from Queen of the South’s Gavin Reilly and Iain Russell, which handed the visitors a deserved first-half lead, the home side stepped up their efforts after the break when McCoist made two significant changes.

He was rewarded when one of those replacements — Templeton — immediately equalised, before Mohsni headed them in front and fellow sub Miller made sure of the points with a late strike.

Early on, Queens looked the more dangerous team and Jim McIntryre’s bold policy of playing three up front caused problems. It was no great surprise when the visitors took the lead midway through the first half. Chris Higgins played a superb pass that cut open the Rangers defence to release Danny Carmichael on the right. He squared the ball for Reilly, who slotted past the exposed Steve Simonsen.

Ahead again: Iain Russell fired Queen of the South ahead to lead 2-1 at the break at Ibrox

Equaliser: Rangers' David Templeton celebrates his equalising goal with team mate Darren McGregor for 2-2

Comeback: Bilel Mohsni's header gave Rangers the lead for the first time as Rangers came from behind to win

Nicky Clark and Kris Boyd both then came close with long-range shots and Rangers quickly equalised in the 27th minute after a corner. Darren McGregor’s volley was initially blocked by keeper Zander Clark, but the ball rebounded out to Zaliukas.

The former Hearts defender sent a looping header back in which ended up in the back of the net when Clark flapped at it under pressure from Mohsni.

Zaliukas then turned villain when his error allowed Queens to regain the lead. He completely misjudged a high ball, allowing Reilly to gallop clear. He unselfishly teed up Russell, who easily scored, with Simonsen again given no chance. McCoist sent on Templeton and Ian Black at half-time in place of Zaliukas and Arnold Peralta and the substitutions paid dividends just 57 seconds into the second period when Templeton curled a superb left-foot shot into the corner of the net.

Rangers finally took the lead in the 64th minute when Moshni stooped very low indeed to direct Lewis Macleod’s corner at goal and it trickled into the net.

Templeton limped off and his replacement Miller replicated his feat of scoring almost immediately after he came on with a composed finish to net his first goal in his third spell with Rangers
