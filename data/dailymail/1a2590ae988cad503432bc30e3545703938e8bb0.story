The sense of courtliness that is as synonymous with Royal Ascot as top hats and tail coats has not always extended from British princes to visiting aristocrats.

The Prince of Wales — a few ago — once spied the Duke of Orleans peering at the fish in an ornamental pond and pushed him in. His finery took almost as long to repair as Anglo-French relations.

Not so here yesterday when the jewel in the season rolled out its most verdant green carpet to welcome Qatar’s rulers and their infinite zillions.

This was the day when Qatar, whose winter the footballing world are hoping to avoid, imprinted themselves on our summer.

In the parade ring, close to the Royal Ascot signs with their crowns, were the five letters: QIPCO, shorthand for Qatar Investment & Projects Development Holding Company.

QIPCO are Ascot’s ‘partners’ and strictly not ‘sponsors’ with that word’s vulgarian overtones. What precisely the owner — Her Majesty — thinks of this is unknown, but apparently all major commercial projects are ‘briefed in to Buckingham Palace’. Discretion has limited the size and scale of the advertising.

But the Al Thani ruling family of Qatar, in the shape of two 20-something-year-old cousins, let their results do the talking for them. The first of the cousins is Sheik Joaan, the brother of the Emir of Qatar and something of an Omar Sharif of the Turf. In his dark shades, grey tails and pointy black shoes, he was phlegmatic throughout the afternoon.

The first victory for his Al Shaqab Stable came in the opening race, the Queen Anne Stakes, when the 4-5 favourite Toronado was a convincing winner. He smiled calmly, as he did following his second win in the next race, the Coventry Stakes, when Frankie Dettori rode The Wow Signal to his 48th Royal Ascot winner.

The other, slightly younger, cousin — a 
rival in racing, though they share some horses — is the slightly less 
svelte Sheik Fahad. He owns Qatar Racing (or Pearl Bloodstock) and his 
approach is more conservative than that of Sheik Joaan, the big spender.
 But for good measure Fahad, in black tail coat, claimed a second and a 
third place yesterday.

This is only the start of this Qatari phenomenon that is turning racing upside down. 

Already they have invested more than $100billion on Harrods, Heathrow, Volkswagen, Al Jazeera and Paris St-Germain football club.

They are fresh to thoroughbred racing but are not new to the sport or to England. Both cousins, like so many from the region, speak the Queen’s English. Both were educated here.

‘I grew up with racing,’ said Sheik 
Joaan, who turns 28 next month. ‘It started in 1991 so it has been quite
 a long time.’ Yes, his father started Al Shaqab Stable in their 
homeland, a distant precursor to this move into Europe.

‘He very much sees Al Shaqab as representing a good face of his country,’ said Harry Herbert, Sheikh Joaan’s racing adviser, the son of the Queen’s former racing manager, the Earl of Caernarvon.

And today? The small matter of Sheik Joaan’s Treve running in the Prince of Wales’s Stakes. Treve is the reigning horse of the year and cost the Qatari £6.4million.
