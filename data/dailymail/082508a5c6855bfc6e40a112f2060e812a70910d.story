Death: Christopher Briggs, 25, pictured with a friend, was enjoying a break in Ibiza with seven friends

A British tourist died after slipping and banging his head in the bathroom of his Ibiza hotel.

Christopher Briggs, 25, of Blackburn, Lancashire, was enjoying a break with seven friends but was found dead hours after returning from a night out in the San Antonio  party resort.

The plumber’s parents Stephen and Susan Briggs said that their ‘wonderful’ son - who was staying at the two-star Hostal Apolo - had been looking forward to the break for a year.

His father said: ‘He was an easy-going, nice lad. Chris was an optimist too, to the extent that he had got his season ticket for Blackburn Rovers, thinking they were going to do great things.

‘He was really looking forward to the holiday. We worked together for the last time on last Tuesday on a bathroom in Manchester and he was really made up about going away.’

Mr Briggs added that ‘everybody liked’ his son and what happened was ‘just a horrible thing’.

The couple said they were receiving help from the British Consulate in Ibiza and expecting their son’s body to be flown home later this week.

Mr Briggs said: ‘The police came round to see us on Sunday afternoon. They knocked quite loudly on the door and I just knew. But you never dream of this happening.

‘It is something you never think you will experience. It is devastating losing your son, but I have also lost the person I worked with every day. Nobody would say anything ill of him.

‘He was very, very popular. All our customers loved him. He just enjoyed life.’

The former Witton Park High School pupil, who was known as ‘Briggsy’ to friends, had been due to spend a week on the island.

His best friend Paul Burke, 24, said the group had gone home early at around 1:30am after a few drinks as they were going to see Swedish DJ Avicii the next night and did not want to be too tired.

The Volkswagen Group parts adviser said: ‘I walked back to the room from the West End with Briggsy. We had been to Cafe Mambo to watch the sun set and then we went for a few beers.

‘When we were walking, he seemed fine and we were talking. When we got back, I brushed my teeth and then we went to bed and started chatting about where we were going to watch the Rovers match.

‘Then we fell asleep. I woke up in the middle of the night to go to the toilet and Briggsy was still asleep. But when I woke up again at about 8:30am, he was on the floor.

‘I could not wake him and there was blood on his head. I woke the other lads and we ran downstairs to ring the ambulance.’

His friends decided to cut their holiday short and arrived home three days earlier than planned.

Mr Burke added: ‘None of us wanted to stay, we just wanted to get home. Everybody is in shock. We are all really close friends. Briggsy got on with everybody and everybody liked him.

‘He loved his football and played five-a-side at the Soccerdome (in Blackburn) three times a week. He was sensible and quiet, but he liked to have a laugh with all his friends. Everybody will miss him so much.’

His school friend Kimberley Hannon said: ‘Chris was like a big brother to me and always looked after me in school. He would do anything for his mates. It is just hard to think he is gone.'

A spokesman for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office said: ‘We are providing consular assistance to the family at this difficult time.’

Blackburn, Hyndburn and Ribble Valley coroner Michael Singleton said he had been made aware of a death in Ibiza.

Antonio Montaluo, a spokesman for the Civil Guard in Ibiza, said: ‘We are waiting on autopsy results, but it appears that Christopher Briggs fell in his apartment. He hit his head and died.’
