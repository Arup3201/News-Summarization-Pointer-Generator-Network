The Co-op Bank would need to be bailed out if there was an 'Armageddon' recession while state-owned RBS and Lloyds would be severely tested, it was revealed today.

The Bank of England has stress-tested how Britain's eight major banks and building societies would fare if the UK undergoes a crisis wiping a third off house prices and the economy imploded.

The Co-op Bank's capital would be exhausted if that happened with its capital ratio falling to a theoretical minus 2.6 per cent, the Bank of England said.

In total the eight high street banks and building societies would lose £13billion.

Before the results were released Co-op Bank boss Niall Booker admitted it would be 'no surprise' if it fails to pass  after its near-collapse last year.

Failed: The Co-op Bank's capital would be exhausted if Britain was hit by an 'Armageddon' recession, the Bank of England has said

Scandal: Shamed Reverend Paul Flowers quit the troubled bank in June last year  having bought hard drugs, right, and used rent boys. It came shortly after a £1.5billion black hole emerged in the bank's finances

He added: 'The bank is much stronger than a year ago. As the regulator notes today, we have achieved the target of building our capital base and the actions we have taken during the first year of our business plan have made the bank more secure for the benefit of all stakeholders.'

The bank was told today it must cut its loan book by £5.5 billion - but said the Bank of England's minus 2.6 per cent capital figure was the case a year ago but not today.

Previously it had a £1.5 billion hole was discovered in its finances, following its ill-fated purchase of the Britannia building society and attempts to buy more than 600 Lloyds branches.

It was also hit by scandal after Reverend Paul Flowers quit the £132,000-a-year job as chairman for taking hard drugs and using rent boys. He ran the bank even though he had no major banking experience. 

The Royal Bank of Scotland - 80 per cent -owned by the taxpayer - just passed the test while Lloyds Bank, 25 per cent-controlled by the Treasury, also slipped through.

The test examined how lenders' balance sheets would stand up to a potential Doomsday scenario of economic crisis by calculating the ratio of capital against loan assets on their balance sheets in such an event.

It judged that Lloyds, 25 per cent owned by the taxpayer, would fall to a capital ratio of five per cent under such a scenario, though by taking severe actions such as cost-cutting this would be 5.3 per cent. It compares with a minimum benchmark set by the Bank of 4.5 per cent.

The group, which includes the Halifax and is heavily exposed to the UK housing market, 'remains susceptible to a severe economic downturn', the test found.

But it said that, in light of the measures it already had in train, it did not require Lloyds to submit a revised capital plan.

The results did not comment on whether the test would affect Lloyds' ability to pay a dividend next year, though it assumed that payouts would not be made in the stress scenario.

In trouble: RBS and Lloyds, who were bailed out by the taxpayer in the last recession, scraped through the stress test

For RBS, 80 per cent owned by the state, the capital ratio would fall to 4.6 per cent in the stress scenario, or 5.2 per cent after 'strategic management actions' which could include cost-cutting.

The Bank said it would ordinarily have required RBS to submit a revised capital plan but, given the progress already made and the capital strengthening actions in its updated plans, this would not be necessary. 

Allowing for emergency 'management actions', Barclays would see its capital ratio fall to 7.5 per cent under the scenario with HSBC scoring 8.7 per cent, Nationwide 6.7 per cent, Santander UK 7.9 per cent and Standard Chartered 8.1 per cent. 

Bank of England governor Mark Carney said following today's exercise: 'This was a demanding test.

'The results show that the core of the banking system is significantly more resilient, that it has the strength to continue to serve the real economy even in a severe stress, and that growing confidence in the system is merited.'
