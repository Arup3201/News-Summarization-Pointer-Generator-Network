Looking at Dan Lester's work for the first time, it is easy to get confused as to whether you are looking at a photograph or a drawing.

Well, the answer is both.

The Leeds-based artist uses digital techniques to combine his own photographs with pencil drawings.

Legless: Using digital techniques the Leeds-based artist is able to be inventive with how it adapts photographs

The works are blended together digitally to create beautifully inventive fusion portraits.

Using his friends as models, the 'obsessive digital doodler' has created a range of intriguing pieces.

A photograph taken before one of his works, showing Lester with his two friends, visually explains the process adopted by the artist.

After he has finished digitally adapting the picture, half of the subjects' bodies are made to look as if they have been drawn on a blank canvas.

The artist also takes inspiration for one of his pieces from the graphic novel series Scott Pilgrim, which was adopted into a movie, Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, in 2010.

The artist has previously worked for Leeds Student Newspaper, LSR radio and The Hype Machine.

He has also designed artwork for musicians, events and British magazines, including The Scribe and No-TiTLE.
