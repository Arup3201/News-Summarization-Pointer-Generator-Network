Meet the Tiler girls - the three sisters who are turning their brute strength into weightlifting gold.

As the head of the clan, 13-year-old Rebekah is quickly making a name for herself in the sport and looks set to be one to watch at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics.

Her trophy cabinet is bulging with more than 100 medals and prizes. But it isn't just Rebekah who holds the talent.

Also on the podium are Sophie, nine, and seven-year-old Lisa, who are following in their sister's footsteps and bagging their own trophies.

And even their youngest sister, four-year-old Emily, is keen not to miss out and often tries her hand at the famous 'clean and jerk' move, practising with a broom handle.

Rebekah's strength became apparent when she was a baby and could lift herself up off the floor, amazing her parents Chris and Emma.

The summer Olympics inspired Rebekah who, having been invited to train for Team England, and as a new member of Team GB, is well on the way to Olympic glory.

Rebekah, from Denholme, West Yorkshire, said: 'I go to Team GB camp weekends where we are tested.

'I'll be training with them for the next four years.'

But her success doesn't come without hard work.

The teenager faces a daily demanding schedule and has to stick to a strict diet.

She said: 'I train three times a week for two hours at a time. And I have to keep to a strict diet, with lots of protein, eggs and spinach.

'This is very important, especially when competitions approach as you have to make sure you are within your weight category.'

As well as the Olympics, Rebekah is also focusing on the Commonwealth Games in Scotland in 2014 and hopes to take part in next year's European youth championships.

Speaking about the sporting opportunities, she said: 'I'm really excited. My school friends think it's great and there's a noticeboard at school showing all my achievements.'

Rebekah attends special camps where her speed work and reaction times are tested.

'I just find weights really easy to lift. I like clean and jerk best,' she added.

Last year, Rebekah won numerous new records, including setting a new title for the snatch and clean and jerk in the 58kg class in the British under-13 contest.

In September alone, the teen, who has been praised for her technique, broke an astonishing nine British records at the National Weightlifting Bergson Trophy in Myetholmroyd, including two at under-15 level set by Britain's best known female weightlifter Zoe Smith.

Rebekah has now moved up to the 69kg body-weight class, and smashed 47 British and regional records, in under 14, 16, 18, 20 and senior categories.

She often outclasses contestants far older than herself. In the British under-20 and under-23s category, she set new Northern Weightlifting records in her class.

But Rebekah's sisters are firmly following in her footsteps and each one recently won their weight category, taking home three gold trophies.

Sophie is the British schools' champion for her group.

Rebekah added: 'I was about five when I started lifting weights. My dad used to bodybuild and I would copy him.'

Chris, who is still involved in bodybuilding, advises his daughter, and Emma provides refreshments at competitions.

Emma said: 'We are usually away every weekend. Bodybuilding has taken over our lives but we love it and really enjoy it.

Family support: Mother Emma says she and her husband are 'really proud' of their daughters

'We are really proud of Rebekah and her sisters. We get nervous but sometimes I'm shaking as I watch.

'I know Rebekah's trained and won't drop the weight but it is nervewracking.'

With so many titles to her name, Rebekah's Olympic future looks hopeful.

She said: 'I'm very excited about it. I really love it and I've met so many nice people too.'
