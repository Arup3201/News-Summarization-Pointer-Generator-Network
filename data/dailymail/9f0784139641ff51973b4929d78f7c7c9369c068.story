A self-help author who led an Arizona sweat lodge ceremony that left three people dead and 18 injured is scheduled to be released from prison today.James Arthur Ray will be freed from the state prison in Buckeye, near Phoenix, where he's been held under minimum security after serving 85 per cent of his two-year sentence on negligent homicide convictions.The deaths occurred after dozens of people traveled to a scenic retreat just outside Sedona, Arizona in October 2009 for Ray's five-day 'Spiritual Warrior' event.

The sweat lodge was touted as a hot structure in which participants could have powerful emotional breakthroughs.

During the five-day retreat the participants endured fasting, mind-altering breathing exercises and sleep-deprivation before the sweat ceremony even began.

One witness recalls he told them: 'You will feel as if you're going to die. I guarantee that.

'You will feel like your skin is going to fall off. When you emerge you'll be a new person, like you've looked death in the eyes and overcome it.'

Things started going wrong about halfway through the two-hour ceremony.

Many participants have said Ray 
ignored pleas for help once they were inside and chided them for wanting
 to leave, even as people were vomiting, getting burned by hot rocks in 
the center and lying unconscious on the ground.

When it was over, 38-year-old Kirby Brown of Westtown, New York, and 40-year-old James Shore of Milwaukee were dead and 18 others injured. Liz Neuman, 49, of Prior Lake, Minnesota, slipped into a coma and died after more than a week in the hospital.

At the trial, prosecutors said Ray ratcheted up the heat to dangerous levels, ignored pleas for help and watched as overcome participants were dragged out of the sweat lodge.

Ray likened the lodge to the Taj Mahal or the Vatican and himself to a priest, according to a transcript of audio recording received.

Participants paid more than $9,000 each to attend Ray's 'Spiritual Warrior' event with the sweat lodge planned as the highlight.

Stephen Ray (no relation to Jame Arthur Ray), ended up in a coma for four days after the sweat lodge and has since lost his sense of taste and smell and suffers migraines and memory loss.

He told the court doctors thought they were witnessing the 
aftermath of a mass suicide when they treated victims in a deadly sweat 
lodge self-help retreat.

James Arthur Ray was convicted of negligent homicide but the jury acquitted him of more serious manslaughter charges. He was sentenced to serve concurrent two-year terms for each of the deaths. His appeal alleged that errors by the prosecution tainted the case.

Ray acknowledged he was responsible for the deaths, but offered no excuses for his lack of action as the chaos unfolded at the sweat lodge. He and his attorneys maintained that he wasn't aware people were dying or in distress, or he would have stopped the ceremony.

The defense centered on the possibility that toxins or poisons contributed to the deaths.

None of the victims' families believes that 20 months was a sufficient sentence. Members of Neuman's family meet regularly to talk about her and share memories and also to vent feelings of frustration and anger – a lot of which is aimed at Ray, said her daughter, Andrea Puckett. The birth of Puckett's two children and her brother's wedding are among the events made bittersweet by Neuman's loss, she said.

And the family members have said that said they'd rather not see him in the self-help industry.

'Ideally, we don't want [Ray] doing anything in the industry anymore,' Puckett said. 'I don't think he has the right to work with people. If he does move forward with that, I hope people become aware of what he did and he changes the way that he handles his seminars and his teachings.'Brown's mother, Virginia, has quit her full-time job to focus on the nonprofit group the family formed to help others avoid the tragedy they faced called SEEK Safely. The organization aims to act as a watchdog for the largely unregulated industry and educate people seeking help from self-help 'experts'.

This week, she was busy reaching out to people in the self-help industry asking them to commit to basic standards to ensure they are truthful, act with integrity and respect the people who choose to follow them – something she said Ray failed to do.

Brown wants her daughter's death to be used as a cautionary tale in the industry. She still wears her jewelry and the blue wrist bands they had made to commemorate Kirby Brown's adventurous life in which she wanted to expand her painting business and create a family of her own, Virginia Brown said.

Seek Safely launches today, coinciding with James Arthur Ray's release.

Denial: Throughout his trial James Arthur Ray and his lawyers claimed Ray was unaware of the predicament of the three people killed and 18 injured during the intensely hot and unregulated sweat lodge ceremony he held in Arizona

One of Shore's best friends, Matt Collins, is on the board of directors for SEEK Safely. He expects that Ray will find a way to continue his teachings but doesn't want to see him profit off tragedy or what he might have learned in prison.'Being in prison is probably a good place to reinvent oneself, hopefully for the better,' he said. 'I don't know whether he's capable of recognizing the damage that the families suffered.'

Lost and found: Kirby Brown's mother Virginia Brown is launching Seek Safely today, coinciding with Ray's release from prison

Self-help: James Ray's brother Jon reached out to the Phoenix community to help his brother upon his release from prison on Facebook

Ray's brother Jon Ray and his wife will be at the prison Friday to greet him upon his release.

He will be required to stay in Arizona for a few months under community supervision.

Jon Ray said the sweat lodge ceremony would have turned out differently had his brother known anyone was in harm's way.

While James Ray has no intention of moving back into public seminars, Jon Ray said 'he's definitely wanting to help people like he's always done.'
