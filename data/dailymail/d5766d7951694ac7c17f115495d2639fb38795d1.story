Reflecting on his life after a near-fatal stroke, Andrew Marr believes he may have taken 'a wrong fork in the path' and wishes he had trained as an artist instead of going into journalism

He is one of the BBC’s most prominent and popular broadcasters, but Andrew Marr says he may have chosen the wrong career.

Reflecting
on his life after a near-fatal stroke, he believes he may have taken ‘a
wrong fork in the path’ and wishes he had trained as an artist instead 
of going into journalism.

The
54-year-old father-of-three – who admitted being a workaholic before 
his illness in January – has recently returned to presenting the Andrew 
Marr show on a Sunday morning.

He
has made a number of changes to his life following his stroke and 
revealed he now draws regularly in the week and the time spent doing 
this was the equivalent of praying to him.

Speaking
about his love of drawing at the Cheltenham Literature Festival, he 
said: ‘I might have been a happier man if I had gone to art school,' 
describing the decision as ‘a wrong fork in the path I think probably’.

Mr
Marr said as a young man he was given the opportunity of studying art 
in Edinburgh, but chose to read English at Cambridge instead.

He
draws for a couple of hours three or four times a week, he said, which 
helped him take time out from his busy life to find ‘space’.

‘When I draw I’m doing something similar to when people pray,’ he said. ‘We need time to get away.’

He described art as ‘a primal need’. ‘It is not a modern affectation,’ he added.

But he is unimpressed by modern art, saying the art world ‘has gone mad’.

‘An absolutely absurd, and I think obscene, amount of money is being spent on these artists,’ he said.

Mr
Marr did not elaborate on which artists he was talking about, but said 
he thought his friend David Hockney was ‘about the only one’ who could 
draw.

He said the only 
good thing about modern art being about ‘3D’ and ‘installations’ was 
that ‘the rest of us can reclaim drawing and reclaim painting without 
having to be part of the art world’.

Mr Marr walked on stage at the festival with some difficulty but without the aid of a stick.

He wore trainers with his blue suit to make it easier for him.

Asked
about his recovery from his stroke, Mr Marr said he was making progress
thanks to physiotherapy - but only because he could afford to pay for 
private sessions.

‘I’m 
very, very lucky because I have got the money to pay for physio and 
help, and you do need a lot,’ he said. ‘A lot of people do not (have the
money).’

He explained 
he had met dozens of people who have had strokes since his 
hospitalisation and that many had not been given the physiotherapy they 
needed to be able to lead normal lives again.

Mr Marr interviewed Home Secretary Theresa May on Sunday as he returned to Andrew Marr show

‘We are brilliant in this country at saving people’s lives - we then chuck them out,’ he said.

‘It’s crazy economically because if you gave them the physio early on they could get back to work quickly and pay taxes.’

He called for a national scheme to help people who did not have the means to pay for physiotherapy to get the help they need.

Last
year, Mr Marr’s marriage to Guardian journalist Jackie Ashley came 
under pressure when he was pictured putting his hand down a female 
colleague’s trousers during an intimate late-night clinch.

However he has now pledged to be a Beta male and a better family man.
