UEFA have had to reshuffle their refereeing pack for Chelsea’s opening Champions League game because of visa issues.

Serbian official Milorad Mazic was set to take charge of the clash against Schalke at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday night, but an administration error means he and his team can’t fulfil the fixture.

They have been swiftly replaced by a Croatian outfit led by Ivan Bebek, whose most high profile game in the competition to date was Barcelona’s win at Spartak Moscow two years ago.

UEFA confirmed the switch was down to visa problems to Sportsmail on Tuesday afternoon.

Bebek was the referee for Celtic’s 2-1 win against Ajax in the group stages last season as well as Bayer Leverkusen’s defeat at Paris St Germain.

He will be aided by Tomislav Petrovic, Miro Grgic, Anto Vucemilovic and Goran Gabril.

Jose Mourinho's side will be looking to continue their good start to the season at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday when they face a Schalke side that are out of sorts. 

The Germans lost 4-1 to Borussia Monchengladbach on the weekend and arrive in England with two teenagers - Kaan Ayhan (19) and Marvin Friedrich (18) - in defence after an injury crisis. 

Even at near full strength Schalke struggled against Chelsea last season, losing 3-0 home and away. They have never scored against Chelsea in four previous matches and have conceded eight goals.
