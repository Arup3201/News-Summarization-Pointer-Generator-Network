Alexis Sanchez took part in Arsenal training on Friday ahead of a potential first match in the red shirt at the Emirates Cup.

The £30million signing could feature for the Gunners at the weekend for the first time since his move from Spanish giants Barcelona.

The 25-year-old scored 47 goals in 141 appearances for Barca before penning a long-term contract at the Emirates in July.

Stellar signing: Sanchez's arrival at Arsenal is one of five made by Wenger this summer

Sanchez missed the club's four-day trip to United States last week, due to his World Cup exploits, but reported back for pre-season training on Tuesday.

The Chile forward has been working on his fitness with Arsene Wenger's backroom staff and could make his first appearance against Benfica on Saturday.

Ahead of the annual tournament in north London, Wenger emphasised the importance of the pre-season competition for his squad's fitness ahead of a long season.

'The Emirates Cup is important because its a real test,' he said at his press conference.

'We have the Community Shield, the Premier League start and the Champions League qualifier but I'm more interested in the fitness because we know tactically where we are.'

Despite the signings of Sanchez, Mathieu
 Debuchy, Calum Chambers and David Ospina, Wenger hinted that he 
is still looking to bolster his squad.

'I'm very happy with my transfers but I'm still open to do more,' he added.

'The window closes on August 31 and we are a bit ahead of what we usually do because the availability was greater for the players we have bought.

'The bigger clubs have done their deals earlier than normal this summer and when one starts the others follow.

'The second week of August will be busy again because everyone checks now what they need in games.'

As well as Benfica, Arsenal will face Ligue 1 runners-up Monaco in the competition on Sunday - with Valencia the other team taking part.
