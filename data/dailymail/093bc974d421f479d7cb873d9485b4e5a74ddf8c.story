Oops: Presidential hopeful Michele Bachmann said she wanted to shut the non-existent U.S Embassy in Iran, but later moved to say she was speaking hypothetically

Iran is proving a real thorn in the side of American politicians in recent days.

But this time it's less to do with the provocative muscle-flexing of the Middle Eastern country's top brass and more to do with some rather embarrassing gaps in the foreign policy knowledge of their U.S. counterparts.

First it was President Barack Obama who slipped up when he spoke out to denounce the attack on the 'English' Embassy in Tehran when it's actually British.

Now one of the candidates looking to oust him from power next year, Michele Bachmann, has revealed her plans to close the U.S. Embassy in the Middle Eastern country despite America not having one there since 1980.

Bachmann's own 'oops' moment came while applauding Britain's decision to pull its nationals out of its embassy after students stormed the building in protest earlier this week.

According to reports, the GOP presidential candidate told a crowd in Waverly, Iowa, yesterday: 'That’s exactly what I would do [if I were  president]. We wouldn’t have an embassy in Iran. I wouldn’t allow that to be there.'

The U.S. cut all diplomatic ties with the country during a crisis in which 52 Americans were held hostage for 444 days between November 4, 1979 and January 20, 1981.

Her gaffe quickly did the rounds online.

Matthew Smith tweeted: 'Michele Bachmann, who is on the House Intelligence Committee, says she will close our Iranian Embassy if elected. #WeDontHaveOne.'

It wasn't long before her campaign went into damage-limitation mode by saying her comments were 'hypothetical'.

Gaffe: President Barack Obama speaking in New York yesterday. The previous day he wrongly referred to the 'English' Embassy in Tehran. He then blundered again when calling it 'the embassy of the United Kingdom' when it is British

A statement said: 'She is fully aware that we do not have an embassy in Iran and have not had one since 1980.

'She
was agreeing with the actions taken by the British to secure their 
embassy personnel and was speaking in the hypothetical, that if she was 
President of the United States and if we had an embassy in Iran, she 
would have taken the same actions as the British.'

Ms Bachmann's comments follow a number of outspoken attacks on Iran in recent weeks - one time making the false claim that the Middle Eastern country had threatened to launch nuclear warheads at the U.S. and Israel.

Ms Bachmann has previously boasted how she had not made a 'gaffe or something that I've done that has caused me to fall in the polls' and has been defiant in claiming that voters were more concerned about jobs and the economy than an occasional blunder by a candidate.

Word play: Both Mr Obama and Ms Bachmann slipped up while denouncing the violence in Tehran when students stormed the British Embassy earlier this week

Those comments came after she once told a crowd in Spartanburg, South Carolina, that it was Elvis Presley's birthday when it was actually the anniversary of his death.

And when she kicked off her presidential campaign in June in Waterloo, Iowa, she called it the home of American actor John Wayne when the town was actually home for a time to serial killer John Wayne Gacy.

In opposing Mr Obama's foreign policy in October, she also said: 'He put us in Libya. He is now putting us in Africa.

'We already were stretched too thin, and he put our special operations forces in Africa.'

Libya is, in fact, a country in Africa.

She is not the only presidential hopeful to get her tongue tied, however.Earlier this month, Herman Cain was left squirming as he struggled with a question about his stance on Libya.

He firstly had to clarify whether Mr Obama had actually supported the uprising before stumbling through an answer.

It came just days after Rick Perry goofed in a Republican debate after being asked to name three departments he would cut.

The federal departments that would be gone if he was president, Perry started on live TV were Commerce and Education - but then he couldn’t get the third.

'Commerce and, let’s see,' he said. 'I can’t. The third one, I can’t. Sorry. Oops.'
