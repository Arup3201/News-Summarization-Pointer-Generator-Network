The pilot of a Southwest Airlines jet that landed at the wrong airport near Branson, Missouri in January only knew after he landed that he made the embarrassing error, newly released recordings show.

'I assume I'm not at your airport,' the pilot radioed to the control tower at Branson Airport in Hollister the evening of Jan. 12, moments after the plane came to a stop at the end of the runway at M. Graham Clark Airport about six miles away.

'Southwest 4013, have you landed?' the air traffic controller responded. After a short pause, the pilot replied, 'Yeah.'

The cockpit audio was released by the Federal Aviation Administration Friday following a federal open records law request from Dallas TV station NBC 5.

The controller was so baffled by the mistaken landing, he even called a colleague at Springfield, Missouri Regional Approach to tell him about it.

'He says he landed at the wrong airport,' the Branson controller said. 'Are you kidding,' the Springfield colleague replied.

'No, I'm not,' the Branson controller responded.

Flight 4013, a Boeing 737-700 carrying 124 passengers, left Chicago Midway Airport and was supposed to land at Branson Airport before continuing on to Dallas Love Field.

As the pilots were in final approach to the airport, air traffic controllers told them they were about 15 miles away. The pilots then said they had the airport in sight, though what they thought was Branson Airport was actually Clark Airport, an airfield that has one runway with a length of just 3,738 feet.

By comparison, the Branson Airport runway is 7,140 feet long. Although the Branson controller cleared the Southwest jet for a visual approach, it also meant the pilots were not using the aircraft's navigation system to ensure the correct orientation.

The pilots later told the National Transportation Safety Board they mistook Clark Airport as Branson Airport since both runways are oriented in a similar direction and have bright lights.

Scott Schieffer, a passenger on the plane, said at the time that he smelled burned rubber after the landing. The aircraft ended up near the end of the runway. A cliff is not far away.

'They came on and said, "Ladies and gentlemen,” we've landed at the wrong airport,’ Schieffer told NBC 5.

The passengers were eventually bused to Branson Airport and Southwest flew in another plane to take the remaining passengers onto Dallas.

The captain and first officer involved in the flight remain on paid leave.

Commercial aircraft landing at the wrong airport is not that rare of an occurrence. In November 2013, a specially configured Boeing 747 jumbo jet freighter known as a Dreamlifter was supposed to land at McConnell Air Force Base in Wichita, Kansas to deliver parts used to manufacture the 787 Dreamliner. Instead, the plane landed nine miles away at Colonel James Jabara Airport.
