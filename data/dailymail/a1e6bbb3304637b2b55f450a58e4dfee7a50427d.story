With their sky-high prices, uni-formed doormen and super-chic staff, it’s not surprising that I had never plucked up the courage to set my decidedly non-designer-shod foot in a designer fashion store.

On behalf of ordinary women everywhere, I decided it was time to steel myself and visit some of our poshest shops, to discover just how high-end brands treat a High Street size 12-14 like me. Armed with some questions that should suggest I’m not quite as well-heeled as their usual customer, I set off to measure my reception on a scale from friendly to frosty.

The list was simple: do they stock a size 16? What is their cheapest item? And do they, ahem, offer discounts?

Just for fun, I threw in a few extra requests: would they take a photo of me wearing one of their outfits? Could I use their loo? And where is the nearest Primark store?

The results were hilarious, surprising and rather illuminating in equal measure...

Claudia Connell could fit into a size 12 at Alexander McQueen

Claudia said that the staff at Mulberry were 'snooty and unhelpful'

Alexander McQueen

The British brand chosen to make Kate Middleton’s beautiful wedding dress, Alexander McQueen is known for its high-end and edgy street fashion.

Their shop is smaller than the others and decked out in neutral shades, and the staff are smiley and chatty.

One assistant tells me that, sadly, 14 is their biggest size, but reassures me by saying: ‘Don’t worry, we cut much more generously than the French labels.’

I ask to try on a £620 red wool dress and am shown to a small but luxurious changing room with thick pile carpets.

The assistant tells me that I will absolutely fit into a size 12, and she’s right. She even brings me some gorgeous black stilettos to try on with the dress.

While taking my photo, she even tells me how  to pose.

The dress looks amazing and I’m tempted to splurge, but it’s only £100 less than my monthly mortgage.

Their cheapest items are T-shirts or leggings for £395 each, which  I’m assured are  ‘amazing quality’.

I’m politely refused a discount (‘Gosh, no, I really wish I could’), but they’re happy for me to use the staff loo.

And, after directing me to the nearest Primark, she tells me not to go at lunchtime when ‘it’s murder’.

Mulberry

Mulberry staff are famed on online forums for being snooty and unhelpful, and I understand why as soon as I walk through the door when a male assistant looks at me as though I’ve just trodden in dog mess. Inside, everyone is fussing around a group of Chinese customers who appear to be buying by the rail. I, meanwhile, am ignored.

While the website claims clothes come in sizes small, medium and large, the small looks as though it might fit a Barbie doll, medium a Barbie that’s let herself go, and there are no large sizes on display at all.

No wonder the unfriendly male assistant looks aghast when I ask for a 16. Their biggest size, he says, is a 12-14 and even that, apparently, comes up small.

When I say nothing will probably fit me, he agrees bluntly: ‘No, probably not.’

Nevertheless, I ask to try on a £1,900 cream raincoat that’s far too tight for me.

He refuses to take my photo in the article (‘we don’t allow photography’, so my picture here is taken outside the shop) or give me a discount, and my request to use the lavatory is declined as, apparently, it’s mysteriously ‘not available at this time’.

I don’t hold out much hope when I ask for the nearest Primark and, sure enough, the sales assistant has ‘absolutely no idea’, even though we’re only a five-minute stroll  from one of the UK’s biggest branches.

The cheapest item in YSL was a £290 plain white top

Claudia was ignored by the staff in Prada

YSL

Known for its chic, classic styles, French designer store YSL is decked out in black with soft lighting and stripped floorboards.

A young male assistant tells me size 12 is their largest and ‘that’s probably more like a ten’.

When I ask what the size 16 people are supposed to wear, he just shrugs and says: ‘They don’t tend to come in, to be honest.’ You don’t say.

I ask to try a £1,960 jacket in a size 12 that I am a good two inches away from being able to button up. Unbelievably, the assistant pushes the sale, saying: ‘I don’t think this is a style that necessarily needs to fasten.’

He may not, but for two grand I expect my clothes to fit.

Not even the cheapest item in the shop — a £290 plain white cotton top — looks as if it would do the honours.

As he takes a photo, I hint that a reduction might persuade me to buy, but he says it’s company policy not to offer discounts.

Though I’m escorted to the staff loo — behind a scruffy stockroom piled high with boxes of shoes and handbags — I suspect this is more about making sure I don’t pinch anything than making it easy for me.

When I ask about Primark, I swear he shakes his head in a ‘Well, if that’s where you usually shop, what the hell are you doing in here?’ kind of way. But, to his credit, he does give me directions.

Prada

Even though there are few customers, I’m ignored by the staff in this huge Italian store.

The rails are heaving with the sort of bejewelled dresses that I can only imagine Ivana Trump wearing, and the cheapest item is an ordinary-looking striped T-shirt for £530.

There’s no size 16. In fact, I’m told abruptly the biggest size is a 12, because ‘our customers are very petite’.

To make matters worse, when I ask for anything that will fit me, I’m told: ‘We’ve got stretchy dresses; one of those might.’

I try on one costing £1,130 in a small changing room that is a bit dirty.

There’s a tissue on the floor and the mirror is smeared with hand prints.

I’m not offered champagne. Worse, the dress strains across my bust — posh designers really seem to have it in for women with breasts.

As the sales girl takes a photo, I tell her there’s a mark on the dress and ask for a discount.

She tells me she’ll fetch another, but when I say I’d prefer money off, she’s perplexed: ‘Why would you want a dirty dress when  you can have a  clean one?’

They let me use their loo, which is in the basement, but by the time I start quizzing them about Primark, it’s obvious I’m not buying.

The sales assistant claims ignorance before rushing off to serve someone else.

Chanel stock both a size 16 and a size 18 dress size

The staff at Gucci were all keen to tell Claudia how great she looked

Chanel

Coco CHANEL famously said a woman can never be too thin or too rich. I can safely say  I’m the only person in this shop who is neither.

I head up a huge, sweeping marble staircase, where I’m met by a friendly sales assistant who tells me they do, indeed, stock size 16, as well as 18.

Most of the items don’t carry price tags and I sense the typical customer doesn’t ask how much things cost.

Even the staff aren’t sure what their cheapest item is, but think it might be a shirt for £600.

Asking to try on a metallic leather skirt for £1,140, I’m directed to a huge changing room — bigger than my living room — decorated with modern art, and offered a glass of champagne on a silver tray.

I’m delighted when I just about get a size 12 buttoned up and the assistant is more than happy to take a snap on my phone.

There’s no joy on my request for a discount, but they show me to the lovely customer toilets.

As for Primark, the assistant hasn’t a clue and asks a colleague who, in turn, asks another. I wonder if this is the first time the word ‘Primark’ has been uttered on the floor of Chanel.

Gucci

Peering through the glass, I see staff who look as though they should be modelling the designer  clothes rather than selling them.

As with every store I have visited, only the smallest sizes are on display, the bigger ones in purdah out the back.

The friendly Italian assistant informs me that 14 is their biggest size, but she thinks they will introduce size 16 soon ‘because people keep asking’.

The cheapest thing I can buy is a T-shirt for £295.

I ask to try on an over-the-top shiny pink suit. I’m offered a refreshment and as it’s early I forgo the champers on offer for orange juice, which is brought on a wooden tray along with a single flower in a vase.

The £815 size 12 trousers fit around the waist but are about a foot too long. The only £1,440 jacket they have is a size ten, and it’s far too tight. I rather like a terracotta silk shirt but at £410 it’s out of my price range. The whole ensemble makes me look like a reject from Saturday Night Fever, but the staff all gather to tell me how fantastic I look.

When I ask about a discount, the assistant says: ‘If you bought the entire outfit I could probably get you something off.’ No chance!

There’s a customer toilet and everyone is happy to direct me  to Primark.
