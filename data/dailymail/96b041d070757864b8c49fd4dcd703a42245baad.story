A 71-year-old man who lost the will to live after his wife and four-year-old daughter were tragically killed in one of the most extraordinary tragedies of the 9/11 terrorist attacks has died of cancer.

David McCourt died on Thursday after a long battle against metastatic melanoma with his much younger second wife, Mary Bryant McCourt, by his side.

While McCourt slowly managed to rebuild his life after losing wife Ruth McCourt, 45, and their daughter Juliana, 4, in 2001, he was initially consumed by a powerful depression - partly owing to the horrific set of coincidences around his family's death.

Tragic: David McCourt has tragically died of cancer, years after admitting he wanted to end his own life after his wife and daughter were killed on 9/11

Ruth was on her way to Disneyland with daughter Juliana and best friend of more than a decade, Paige Farley Hackel, when tragedy struck.

The trio was traveling to Boston's Logan International Airport to begin a vacation in Southern California.

But the best friends couldn't get seats on the same plane.

Hackel, 46, left first on American Airlines Flight 11, while Ruth and Juliana boarded United Airlines Flight 175.

Both of these planes were hijacked by terrorists who flew them into the Twin Towers on September 11, 2001.

'This is all completely appropriate,' Ruth's mother, Paula 
Scott, told the Sun Sentinel at the time.

'I knew that if one of them had to go, both of them would have to
go. And now our families have come together.'

But in a further bizarre twist, Ruth's brother Ronald Clifford was standing outside the World Trade Center - there for a business meeting - and watched as the plane carrying his sister and niece crashed into the south tower.

'It was an incredible nightmare,' Clifford told the Mirror. 

'I went into therapy immediately because I couldn’t sleep. I couldn’t close my eyes.'

When he returned home to New Jersey that day, he realized it was likely his family members were on that flight.

Clifford said he didn't think David McCourt would ever get over the tragic death - neither did David.

In January 2002, the widower said he had considered suicide.

'Ruth and Juliana were my life and my passion,' he told an audience at a New London synagogue.

'I
was going to end it all. If faith could justify taking these two 
beautiful creatures, I just didn't want to go on. But something kept me 
going.

'It's been a journey of spiritual awakening to go from where I was.

'If you don't have the spiritual awakening, you don't survive.'

But McCourt did eventually find the strength to move on.

He helped found B.R.A.V.E. Juliana, a program of HELP USA, to teach nonviolence and conflict resolution to children.

He said his wife and daughter died because some countries teach their children to hate.

'What we have do is to start with the children in this country and teach them tolerance, compassion and understanding,' McCourt said in 2002.

A garden on the grounds of New London's Lyman Allyn Art Museum was established to honor the memories of Juliana and Ruth McCourt.

David McCourt called it a 'metaphor for seasons and renewal and healing for those who are left behind'.

McCourt later retired to Florida and married second wife Mary Bryant McCourt, several years his junior, in 2011.

Mary had her own story of tragedy, according to Palm Beach Daily News.

At 14, she became a top Ford Model, and had a masectomy in her 30s after being diagnosed with breast cancer.

But six days after her fifth round of chemotherapy, she ran the New York Marathon.

Her brother Don, a quadriplegic, made history when he ran the New York Marathon by pushing his head back in a power chair.

This led her to found the Achilles Freedom Team of Wounded Veterans.

Not long after 9/11, her brother Don died and she met her future husband David.

They 'overcame their difficulties together'.
