Leaders of the Palestine Liberation Organisation have today decided to stop all forms of security coordination with Israel - a step that could lead to an escalation of tensions. 

Three members of the Palestinian Central Council (PCC), the second highest Palestinian decision-making body, said the decision was taken during a two-day meeting that ended today. 

'The council decided to cease all forms of security coordination with Israel,' a PLO official said.

Decision: It is not clear if Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas will implement today's resolution by the PLO's Central Council

A statement issued by the 110-member PCC read: 'Security coordination in all its forms with the authority of the Israeli occupation will be stopped in the light of its (Israel's) non-compliance with the agreements signed between the two sides.'

It said Israel 'should shoulder all its responsibilities towards the Palestinian people in the occupied state of Palestine as an occupation authority according to international law'.

The decision is certain to provoke Israel, which sees security coordination as vital to maintain calm in the West Bank. Palestinian security forces also require Israeli permission to send patrols into some areas of the West Bank to preserve law and order.

It is not clear if Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas will implement the resolution by the PCC.

Set up under the 1993 Oslo autonomy accords which founded the Palestinian Authority, the coordination involves the sharing of intelligence and is considered crucial for Israel to keep tabs on Islamist movement Hamas and its West Bank members.

Israeli officials had no immediate comment on the PCC move.

The PCC statement also said the United Nations Security Council should 'determine a deadline to end the Israeli occupation and ensure that the state of Palestine is enabled to practice its sovereignty on its land occupied since 1967, including its capital east Jerusalem'.

It added: 'The concept of a Jewish state is rejected and also of a (Palestinian) state with provisional borders is rejected. 

'Any formula that will keep an Israeli military or settler presence on any part of the land of the state of Palestine is rejected.' 

The Palestinians submitted a UN Security Council resolution in December - which was voted down - calling for an end to Israel's occupation of the West Bank within two years.

In January, President Abbas sought membership in the International Criminal Court, paving the way for possible war crimes charges against Israel.

In response, Israel withheld tax transfers to the Palestinian Authority. Activists in Abbas' Fatah movement countered by enforcing a boycott of goods made by Israeli food companies.

Despite the tensions, security coordination between Abbas' forces and Israeli troops has continued in the West Bank.
