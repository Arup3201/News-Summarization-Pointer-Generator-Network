Adnan Januzaj will not be leaving Manchester United before the transfer window closes, Sportsmail understands.

The Belgian playmaker had been linked with a move to Roberto Martinez's Everton for the rest of the season, but remains firmly in Louis van Gaal's plans. 

Toffees boss Martinez is an admirer but the talented 19-year-old started Saturday's 3-1 win over Leicester and is expected to get further chances at Old Trafford as the season progresses.

Paris Saint-Germain and David Moyes' Real Sociedad were two other clubs that expressed an interest, but it is understood that Januzaj would prefer to stay and fight for his place at Old Trafford.

Jauzaj's start on Saturday was his first Premier League game in nearly three months, and he was also in United's side that faced Cambridge United in the FA Cup.  

Elsewhere, United retain an interest in Everton defender Seamus Coleman but any movement there is not expected until the summer.
