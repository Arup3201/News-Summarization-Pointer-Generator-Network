While the only surviving member of an Oklahoma family killed in a fiery car crash last month battles for her life, her immediate relatives are desperately trying to raise money to bury their dead loved-ones.

Stephanie Guzman, 15, is still in intensive care following the accident which claimed the lives of her mother Elvira, father Valentin, her 13-year-old sister Annie, 11-year-old sister Patricia and three-year-old brother Valentin.

The family car was struck head-on by a wrong way driver on June 29 and three weeks later some of them have yet to be buried - prompting family friend, Roy Vargas, to launch a GoFundMe account to help pay the costs.

'I don’t think there’s words to describe it,' said family friend Roy Vargas. 'There’s just not words to describe it.

'I know other tragedies are happening here in our community there’s only so much funding but we’re hoping the word gets around and people understand the Guzman family needs some financial support,' said Vargas to KHOU.

Five of six people in the car lost their lives after being struck by the car driven by an alleged drunk driver.

Initially the GoFundMe page raised only $10 over 14 days, but when the Guzman's immediate relatives made a direct appeal to the media the amount raised sky-rocketed to $35,000.

Their goal is to raise $100,000 so that they can properly bury each member of the family.

With a third of her family killed at the hands of a suspected drunk driver, Stephanie's aunt Soledad Santoyo hasn’t lost hope.

'I miss my sister so much,' said Santoyo.

She hopes her sister knows the family will be rallying around Stephanie.
