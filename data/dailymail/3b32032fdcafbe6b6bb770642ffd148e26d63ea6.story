An Australian man who has already spent more than a month in police custody has now been charged over a motorbike crash that killed a local mother in Indonesia.

Jake Drage's dream surfing adventure in West Java was cut short on June 30 when his motorbike collided with another at an intersection, which was ridden by a teenage girl and her mother.

Police on Monday said they had finally charged the 23-year-old with 'reckless' driving causing death after he was already held without charge for a month.

If found guilty, Drage faces a maximum six years in jail and/or a maximum fine of $1,100.

Drage clipped the teenage girl's bike back in June, according to his mother Tiena Drage.

The girl's mother, who was on the back of the bike and not wearing a helmet, died of her injuries in hospital the next day.

Deny Irwansyah, chief of the traffic accident unit in Sukabumi, West Java, acknowledged the delay in the case.

'The process has been going for 45 days now, we've gone back and forth to the prosecutors four times,' he said.

The victim's family tried to help Drage by writing a letter to police requesting he not be charged and Drage's friends have been fundraising for the woman's family.

In a statement issued from his cell last month, Drage said he hoped to befriend them.

'The accident leaves me with a sadness that is very difficult to describe and I want to thank her family for all the kindness and goodwill they have shown me,' he said.

'My family will be providing support to them and I hope we can be warm and close friends in the future.

'It was a tragic accident and the family understands and accepts that the tragedy was not my fault.'

Prosecutor Eka Aryana said there would be no special treatment for the Australian.

'The dossier has been accepted,' she told reporters.

'Next we will set a date for trial, hopefully it won't be long, one or two weeks.

'There's no discrimination in this case, no special treatment, he must be processed by the courts.'
