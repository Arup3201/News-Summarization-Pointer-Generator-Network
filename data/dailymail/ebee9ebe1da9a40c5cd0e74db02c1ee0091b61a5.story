A hotel may win rave reviews as a romantic retreat, but it could be miles from civilisation. Equally, a bustling urban hotel in the thick of it may not be the ideal location to whisk a loved one away for a restful weekend. 

When splashing out on a luxury hotel, you want to ensure it excels in what you are looking for, be it a foodie getaway, hip urban location, luxurious spa or family-friendly activities. This week, hotel guide Conde Nast Johansens awarded the best hotels in the UK and Ireland.

From the top hotels in service and dining, to the most ideal resorts for groups or romantic getaways, the guide has named these hotels the best of the best.

New kid on the block: Waldorf Astoria Edinburgh  has been named Best Newcomer in the UK and and Ireland

Romantic getaway: Alexander House Hotel in Sussex has a luxurious spa

Best Newcomer: Waldorf Astoria Edinburgh – The Caledonian, Scotland

Melding 'Victorian heart and 21st-century soul', the Hilton-owned Waldorf Astoria brand has lovingly restored the 241-room 'grand dame' of Edinburgh. 

Built in a former railway station, the Waldorf brand has injected contemporary elegance into the city landmark, its only UK hotel.

Rooms from £175. 

Service by the sea: The Atlantic prides itself on 'unstuffy hospitality'

Room with a view: Panoramic views of the London landmarks landed Cheval Three Quays among the best

Best For Romance: Alexander House Hotel and Utopia Spa, West Sussex, England

Whether its enjoying some fizz in the Champagne Bar, being kneaded in the Grecian-style Utopia Spa, or lounging in a luxurious lodge room, this Sussex hotel and spa is the ultimate romantic mini break. 

Rooms from £155. 

Family fun: Indoor and outdoor pools, croquet, tennis and golf make Chewton Glen a fun-filled paradise

Modern comforts: 130 Queen’s Gate Apartments enjoy a prime location and are home away from home

Chic: Understated elegance and great food from Luke Holder and Angela Hartnett at Lime Wood in New Forest

Best Service: The Atlantic Hotel, Jersey, Channel Islands

This white-shuttered seaside hotel is all about beach chic. The laid-back surf vibe doesn't mean blasé service though. Conde Nast Johansens admires The Atlantic Hotel's unstuffy hospitality.

The Michelin-starred The Ocean Restaurant makes it a destination in itself.

Rooms from £150.

Best For Exclusive Use:  Cheval Three Quays at the Tower of London, England

Floor to ceiling windows with a panoramic view of The Shard and Tower Bridge? No wonder Cheval Three Quays is making waves.

The Square Mile newcomer in luxury serviced apartments boasts cutting edge interior-design... but it's all about the views from the prime riverside location. 

Apartments from £250.

Best For Families: Chewton Glen, Hampshire, England

This New Forest overachiever is deserving of all its awards and glory, according to Conde Nast Johansens, who love the suite treehouses in the woods.

There are plenty of activities to please the whole brood, with a luxury spa, indoor and outdoor pools, croquet lawn, tennis and nine hole golf course. 

Rooms from £280. 

Best Value: 130 Queen’s Gate Apartments, London, England

Ultra-modern apartments in the heart of the London tourist attractions. A short stroll from Hyde Park, Natural History Museum, Kensington Palace and the V&A, 130 Queen’s Gate Apartments is certainly prime position.

All the mod cons, plus appliances to make guests feel at home such as washer dryer and dishwasher - and daily housekeeping if you don't feel like lifting a finger.

Apartments from £200. 

Best Dining Experience: Hartnett Holder & Co. at Lime Wood, Hampshire, England

A seasonal menu foraged from local produce, a 'Raw & Cured' food bar, and a Kitchen Table with superstar chefs Luke Holder and Angela Hartnett... Lime Wood is the name in foodie getaways this year.

The rest of the hotel is sublime as well, with the luxurious Herb House Spa, private Forest Lodges with rustic chic interiors, freestanding bathtubs in the suites, and cosy fireplaces.

Rooms from £255. 

Countryside retreat: Coworth Park pampers guests at its award-winning spa

Magnificent: Ireland's Ashford Castle was once the holiday home of the Guinness family

Best Hotel With Spa: Coworth Park, Berkshire, England

This Dorchester Collection property is above and beyond the average countryside hotel, says Conde Nast Johansens.

The spa, which is partially submerged into the surrounding hillside, enjoys breathtaking views, while its guests enjoy luxuriating in the relaxing retreat. 

The hotel also has three restaurants and a chocolate room, where a Chocolatier whips up decadent treats.

Rooms from £215. 

Best Waterside Hotel: Ashford Castle, Mayo, Ireland

Dating back to 1228, it was the Guinness family's country retreat up until 1921, and was first established as a hotel in 1939. 

The magnificent Ashford Castle  looks like it belongs in a fairytale, with its stone turrets, manicured gardens and waterside position next to Lough Corrib lake.

Rooms from £235.

'Restaurant with rooms': The Pig puts the focus on the food, but still excels in the accommodation

Best Countryside Hotel: The Pig, Hampshire, England

It describes itself as 'a restaurant with rooms', and the food at The Pig really is the focal point. 'Simple' British food is sourced from within the kitchen garden or from within 25 miles by Chef James Golding.

The rooms, while dismissed as secondary, are worth mentioning too. The design is chic and understated, with an element of fun (like bunk beds for the kids). Spa treatments are in a converted Potting Shed.

Rooms from £139. 

Worth travelling for: Get a group together for exclusive-use Foxhill Manor at Dormy House Hotel

Best Destination Hotel: Dormy House Hotel including Foxhill Manor, Worcestershire, England

Foxhill Manor is nestled in the private 400-acre Farncombe Estate in the Cotswolds. The 17th-century farmhouse boasts an 80-seat ballroom for adults and a beanbag-filled media room for the kids.

Twin bathtubs overlooking the grounds from the bedrooms, a personal butler and a fully-stocked pantry for midnight snacks make the exclusive-use residence is not a home away from home - it's a far more luxurious one.

Prices available upon enquiry.

Urban legend: Sofitel London St James sits on prime real estate on Pall Mall

Best Urban Hotel: Sofitel London St James, England

You can't get much more convenient than Sofitel London St James, located moments away from Trafalgar Square on the corner of Pall Mall.
