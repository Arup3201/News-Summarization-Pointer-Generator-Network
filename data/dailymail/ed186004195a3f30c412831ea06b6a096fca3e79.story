These pictures show the incredible lengths rangers will go to when moving rhinos to a 'safe haven' within South Africa's flagship reserve where they will receive extra protection from poachers.

Rangers at Kruger National Park have carried out at least 45 such captures since last month as part of a plan to create a stronghold and prevent the slaughter of the endangered animals.

The rhinos were first darted from a low-flying helicopter and then herded towards a road.

Once they were subdued and blindfolded, rangers took blood and skin samples and installed a microchip in the horns as a way to identify Kruger's stock.

The sedative must be strong enough to immobilise a rhino but weak enough so that the animal can walk into a crate with men pushing and pulling it with a rope.

Some of the rhinos have been moved to other parks within South Africa, which is home to 80 per cent of the world's rhinos, and the relocation 'experiment' is expected to escalate next year.

It was announced earlier this week that 1,020 rhinos have been poached so far in 2014, exceeding last year's record of 1,004.

About two-thirds of the rhinos poached this year died in Kruger, a park that's about the size of Israel and larger than the US state of Connecticut.

Poachers often dodge an overstretched force of 400 rangers as well as some military units that monitor the 220-mile border between Kruger and Mozambique.

The protection zone encompasses at least one-quarter of the park, and is already home to many of Kruger's roughly 10,000 rhinos - half the national population. 

Dr Sam Ferreira, a large mammal ecologist at Kruger, said the relocated rhinos have adapted well to their new home. 

'It's like they're coming to a Saturday afternoon party,' he said.

Markus Hofmeyr, head of veterinary services at Kruger park, said: 'The goal is to basically ensure that you've got a foundation of animals that are secure and that you can use as a source population to take elsewhere.'

Kruger will focus aircrafts, ranger teams and high-tech surveillance on the zone. 

The initiative is partly funded by American philanthropist Howard Buffett, a son of investor Warren Buffett who pledged nearly £15million to Kruger's anti-poaching efforts.

Howard Buffett said some of the same methods used by the United States to monitor its border with Mexico will be used in Kruger, including aerostats - large, tethered balloons with infrared cameras that scan the landscape.

Environmental Affairs Minister, Edna Molewa, said 'South Africa is considering a range of rhino strongholds, inclusive of national parks, provincial reserves, communal areas and private reserves.'

She added that the Department of Environmental Affairs was also looking into the benefits of moving some rhino out of the country. 

Rhinos were once common throughout Africa and Asia with an approximated worldwide population of 500,000 in the early twentieth century. 

But despite intensive conservation efforts, poaching of this  species is dramatically increasing, pushing the remaining rhinos closer and closer towards extinction.

The Western black rhino was declared extinct by the IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature) in 2011, with the primary cause identified as poaching. 

All five remaining rhinos species are listed on the IUCN Redlist of threatened species, with three out of five species classified as critically endangered.

South Africa is home to 83 per cent of Africa's rhinos and 73 per cent of all wild rhinos worldwide. 

It was announced earlier this week that 1,020 rhinos have been poached so far in 2014, exceeding last year's record of 1,004.

About two-thirds of the rhinos poached this year died in Kruger, a park that's about the size of Israel and larger than the US state of Connecticut.

This is far higher than the total of 668 rhinos killed by poachers in South Africa in 2012.
