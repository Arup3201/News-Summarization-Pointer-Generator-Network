As marriage proposals go making sure your intentions can be seen from space is a strong sign of commitment.

And when Anthony 'Tony' Larson, 41, decided to ask his girlfriend Emma Wightman to marry him he wanted everybody - even the odd astronaut - to see.

After being cajoled into a beach walk at Woolacombe, North Devon on Saturday, Miss Wightman, 37, was pleasantly surprised to see an 'EM' in a love heart etched into the sand on the beach below.

Loud and clear: Anthony 'Tony' Larson made sure his girlfriend Emma Wightman - and the odd astronaut looking down from space - knew his intentions when he got friends to draw this message in the sand at Woolacombe, North Devon

Yes, yes, yes! After tucking into strawberries and champagne with friends Miss Wightman thought she better leave her answer and drew a 'yes' and a kiss in the sand

She told MailOnline: 'I looked at Tony and said, "did you do that?" Then he started smiling from ear to ear and the look on his face, I just knew then.'

Two of Mr Larson's friends, armed with garden rakes then carefully carved out 'Will You Marry Me' as the couple watched from Marine Drive on the dunes.

'He waited till the question mark appeared and then got down on one knee,' Miss Wightman said. 'There were lots of tears from both of us and then a 'yes yes yes!''

Newly engaged: The happy couple have known each other for 20 years after meeting at the gym but only got together in January. Miss Wightman said she knew he was The One straight away

Mr Larson, an accountant, also presented the administrator with a 'beautiful' single solitaire diamond ring.

Miss Wightman had been planning to visit the hairdresser on Saturday after being dissatisfied with a previous cut but had been told by Mr Larson and in fact everybody she knew, that it looked fine.

'Tony was saying, "It's fine, I don't know why you keep mucking around with it".' Miss Wightman said.

Her friends all said it was fine too and unbeknown to Miss Wightman even called the hairdresser to ask them not to book her in if she called.

'They were all in on it,' she said.

'In the end we went to the beach for a walk but I did wonder why he was in such a rush,' Miss Wightman recalled.

The couple from Barnstaple, Devon, have known each other as friends for 20 years after meeting at a gym but only got together in January.

Miss Wightman said she knew Mr Larson was The One straight away and the couple had talked about marriage and even looked at rings.

After popping the question the happy couple headed down to the beach where their friends were all assembled with champagne, roses and strawberries.

'There were lots of bubbles and laughing, joking and cheering,' Miss Wightman said. 'Just as we were about to leave I thought I'd better give my answer and drew a 'yes' in the sand.

'When we went back up there were lots of people parked up, they saw us and said, 'is that you, is that you?' and 'congratulations'.

The wedding is set for June next year but one of their friends will have to wait a little longer for her proposal.

On their way back up to the car park the future Mr and Mrs Larson encountered a friend Anthony Jestin, whose girlfriend, also called Emma had thought the sandy message was for her.

'He said, "Oh my god, Emma thought it was for her".' Miss Wightman said laughing. 'He had to turn around and say "no" very quickly, but she's OK.'
