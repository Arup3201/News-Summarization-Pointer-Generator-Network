When attending an event aimed at showcasing the finest in British fashion, you could be forgiven for blending into the background. 

But, never one to go unnoticed, model and TV presenter Alexa Chung had no problems standing out on the red carpet at this evening's British Fashion Awards, putting her best fashion foot forward in a beautifully-ornate gown designed by Brit Emilia Wickstead.

The 31-year-old added a bit of flare to her ensemble with a quirky takeaway box-shaped Charlotte Olympia handbag, which was decorated with hand-stitched Oriental-style insects.

Hosted by comedian Jack Whitehall, for the second year in a row, the awards are set to honour those who have greatly impacted the fashion industry.

The event boasted a guestlist of London's best-dressed, including Alexa's close friends Poppy Delevingne and Suki Waterhouse, all of whom were there to see Poppy's younger sister Cara scoop the award for Model of the Year for the second time. 

Cara's fellow models and long-time friends Karlie Kloss and Joan Smalls took to the stage to present the 22-year-old, who first won the coveted prize in 2012.

Dressed in a beautiful Burberry gown, Cara thanked her fans for continuing to believe in and support her, saying: 'I would be nothing without fashion.' Shortly afterwards, her elder sister Poppy seized the opportunity to share a touching tribute to the Burberry model, congratulating her on her overwhelming fashion success.

Then and now: Shortly before the ceremony began, Alexa shared a snap of her beauty preparations on Instagram

Earlier in the evening Alexa, who is an ambassador for the British Fashion Council, shared a candid snap of her preparations for the glittering ceremony on her Instagram account, taking the opportunity to also plug her collaboration with beauty brand Eyeko. 

Alongside a selfie, which showcased her dramatic eye make-up for the evening, Alexa commented: 'EXTREME close up @eyeko lashes :-))) getting readu for @britishfashioncouncil awards'

And while Cara was the clear winner this evening, Alexa has had her fair share of British Fashion Awards success in the past, having won the British Style Award, three years in a row, in 2011, 2012 and 2013.

On Saturday night, the fashion icon prepared for the awards ceremony at a British Fashion Council party, which was held in honor of her contribution to the British fashion industry. 

In 2012, after being appointed as the BFC's Young Style Ambassador, Alexa revealed that she maintained her passion for British fashion, even while living abroad, describing London as the most stylish city in the world. 

'I always name London first when asked which city in the world has the best style,' she said. 

'There's something so inherently rebellious about how people naturally style themselves. Brits aren't afraid to experiment or take risks with how they look, perhaps that's why London has always been home to the most dynamic and daring designers in the world. 

'I adore fashion and am proud that it's now officially my job to champion those London designers both new and established that inspire me so much.'
