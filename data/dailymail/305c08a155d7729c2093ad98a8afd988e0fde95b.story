Recently, I tried to book my 11-year-old daughter Rosalie on the Eurostar to Paris. She’s off for a week-long trip to stay with a family friend who’s studying at college there and couldn’t be more excited.

Our friend Emma would have met her at the Gare du Nord, and, while she speaks only a little French, if Rosalie had run into any problems she could always have called me on her mobile.

But her plans were thrown into jeopardy when Eurostar flatly refused to let me buy her a ticket.

Off on an adventure: Rosie, aged 11, has been travelling alone since a young age

The problem? She was to travel there alone and, no matter how mature and competent we, her parents, deem her to be, that’s against their rules. Apparently, she’s too young, by nearly a year.

I tried to remonstrate with the manager. ‘She’s been taking trains on her own for years,’ I told her. ‘Not safely,’ she retorted.

And she’s not the only person who seems to think I’m irresponsible to let my daughter travel abroad alone.

I know other parents insist that, by fostering Rosie’s independence and encouraging her to travel to the Continent on her own, I’m flinging her in the path of every paedophile in Europe.

This wasn’t the first time we’d bundled Rosie off to a foreign land on her own.

Foreign land:  Rosalie Atkins, now 11, travelled to Lyons on her own

Eurostar may insist we should mollycoddle youngsters, but British Airways takes a far more sensible approach. Rosie has already flown to Lyons in France. And not only was she alone, she was just nine at the time. What’s more, she didn’t even have a mobile telephone — and we were comfortable that she only used the landline to ring home once or twice a week.

She neither knew the French exchange family she was going to stay with, nor could she speak a word of the language.

However, she was keen to go and my husband and I agreed that it would be good for her. She flew with British Airways, who have a Skyflyer Solo service for unaccompanied children, and we booked a spare seat for her harp.

She loved it. The French exchange family picked her up from the airport and she had a wonderful holiday. When I told the Eurostar manager that Rosie frequently travels by train on her own, I sensed she was considering whether to report me to the police — and perhaps you are too.

Terrible mother? Many have condemned Anne

After all, when I wrote about this subject for Mail Online earlier this week, some of the readers left me in no doubt they thought I was crazy. ‘What a terrible mother,’ was the gist of many of the kinder comments.

‘A disaster waiting to happen,’ declared one man, while another urged: ‘Take her kids off her. For their own safety.’

If they only knew what else I and my husband have let our five children do on their own, no doubt they’d be even more horrified.

All our children — Serena, Lara, Alexander, Benjamin and Rosie— have been young adventurers.

I believe letting children be independent could actually make them safer in the long run.

It’s been a deliberate policy to let them travel alone from as young as possible — not because I want to save time for me, but to give them reserves of confidence and chutzpah that would carry them into successful and interesting futures.

And, before you say this must be for my own convenience, I’ll have you know that I spent two terms teaching my eldest daughter Serena how to bicycle the two miles to senior school aged 11 and the same amount of time teaching Rosie to walk to school. How much easier would it have been to accept my father’s kind offer to drive her there every day for us!

It’s simply nonsense to suggest I’m endangering my children by doing this. In fact, I’d have done it sooner if I’d been able.

All of us in the family wanted Rosie to walk to school (all of 20 yards away, watched by us from the doorstep) when she was five, but the school insisted we accompany her. That’s why, when we moved from Oxfordshire to Bedford a year later, I made it clear to the new headmistress that Rosie would be walking in on her own.

Independent: 'I like the fact that my parents trust me. It also prepares your child for adulthood' says Rosie

It was less than a mile, mostly through a pedestrianised shopping centre and finishing along a traffic-free path by the river. When my own father expressed mild surprise, I pointed out that he had crossed town alone to school from the tender age of seven. I walked to school alone aged five.

All the evidence shows that no more children are snatched off the streets by paedophiles now than 50 years ago. All that has changed is traffic. And, critically, our perception of danger. Extraordinarily, other parents complained to the headteacher — Rosie wasn’t safe they said, perhaps thinking she might fall in the river, be run over, raped or abducted, but the head backed up our right to do what we thought best, despite the criticism.

The next year, Rosie went on the bus to visit her sister Lara in Cambridge. We put her on at one end, alerted the driver to her presence, and Lara met her at the other.

She also visited Serena in London, who would do the same at St Pancras, the East Coast manager having upgraded Rosie to First Class to keep an eye on her.

So when she was offered the opportunity to try out for a music scholarship and a choristership at Durham Chorister School 200 miles away, 18 months ago, she went. Alone. For a week.

She was successful in her endeavours and started last September without me or her father ever having visited the place.

Nowadays, she capably manages railway stations and journey changes she has never encountered before. If things aren’t running to schedule, she has no qualms about borrowing the train manager’s telephone (she seldom remembers to charge hers) to alert us or her sisters to her whereabouts.

Some people may be horrified that she’ll happily walk up to a strange man and talk to him, but I think it’s brilliant she’s got the confidence to be able to do so — choosing a man in uniform because she knows he’s there to help her.

‘I like the fact that my parents trust me,’ she said recently. ‘It prepares you for adulthood.’

Time to grow up: Anne believes the idea of children travelling alone is more scary for the adult

Indeed it does. Our children — who, except for Rosie, are now in their twenties — have been all over the world without us, including Thailand, the Palestinian West Bank and Madagascar. Being allowed to travel alone has taught them confidence, independence and risk management .

What’s more, statistics show a child is more likely to be killed inside a car than out. And cyclists — such as my children and I — live longer because it makes for a healthier lifestyle.

The reason more parents do not allow their children to travel alone may be more about them than the safety of their offspring.

We want to feel we are doing everything to keep our children safe, that we have a vital role and that they need us. But by doing this, we can actually keep them unnaturally immature and prevent them learning to be safe for themselves.

That’s why I believe my way could actually be safest. It just feels more scary for the adult. Waving your six-year-old child goodbye as she walks to school on her own for the first time is terrifying. Much easier to get in the car.

But that first day has to come sooner or later and, provided it is done responsibly and sensibly, sooner can really be better.

Maybe it’s time for us adults to grow up and start acting in a way that’s best for our children rather than for ourselves.
