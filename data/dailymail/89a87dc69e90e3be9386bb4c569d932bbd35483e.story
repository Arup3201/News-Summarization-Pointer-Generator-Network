Ryanair has apologised after it refused to refund the ticket of a dead passenger because it said she had died too soon before her flight.

Beryl Parsons, 78, was due to fly to the Canary Islands with her son and grandchildren for a holiday in October.

But in June, four months before the flight, she was unexpectedly told she only had three weeks to live and died.

Her son, Doug, 44, wrote to the budget
airline to ask for a refund for his mother’s £230 share of the £1,074 
airfares from Stansted to Fuerteventura and included a copy of her death
certificate.

But it refused because it said Mrs Parsons, who had cancer, had died more than 28 days before the booked flight.

Mr Parsons, an accountant from 
Norwich, Norfolk, had wanted to take a last holiday with his mother, 
partner Lisa, 32, and children Tanya, 11, and Cameron, seven, after she 
was diagnosed with cancer.

They planned to go away at Christmas, but she was too ill so they did not book.

When her health appeared to improve in
April - after she had a tumour removed from her womb - they booked the 
Ryanair flights to the Canary Islands. But in June she was unexpectedly 
told the cancer had spread and was terminal.

Mr Parsons said his mother had been desperately looking forward to the holiday with her family.

Happier days: Doug and his mum Beryl at a reception some years ago. Her first comment, when she was told she was dying, was: 'Oh, I suppose, I will have to cancel my holiday then'

He said: ‘We were going to stay in the same villa where I had taken mum five years ago and she was really looking forward to it.

‘To be honest I thought it would be 
her last ever holiday because her mobility was so poor and I booked all 
sorts of disability assistance for her at the airport.

‘Her first comment when she was told she was dying was, “Oh, I suppose, I will have to cancel my holiday then”.

After his mother's death: Doug Parsons has vowed never to fly Ryanair again

Decision-maker: When Mr Parsons asked Ryanair (headed by Michael O'Leary, pictured) for a 
refund, it offered its 'condolences' but said Mrs Parsons had breached 
its terms and conditions

'She loved travelling and it was the thought of the holiday that was keeping her going.’

Ryanair is the largest low-cost carrier in Europe and flies to 145 destinations, including 15 in the UK.

However, it has repeatedly come under fire over its hidden charges for passengers for everything from booking online to checking in bags.

Last month, it emerged pilots were ordered to fly more slowly in a bid to save money on fuel after a fall in the airline’s quarterly profit.

This month it was revealed that following an internal survey of 1,000 pilots, two-thirds said they did not feel comfortable raising safety issues through the airline’s internal system, while nine out of ten said it did not have an ‘open and transparent safety culture’.

Most recently staff have been told to increase the company’s profits by avoiding giving change back to passengers when selling them things from the trolley.

In the past Ryanair has talked of replacing 10 rows of seats with a standing area as well as introducing a coin-operated toilet on some planes.

When Mr Parsons asked Ryanair for a 
refund, it offered its ‘condolences’ but said Mrs Parsons had breached 
its terms and conditions.

The letter read: ‘Unfortunately, we 
regret to advise you that in accordance with Ryanair’s General 
Conditions of Carriage detailed below we cannot refund your booking’

It included a section from its terms 
and conditions regarding bereavements that states: ‘In the case of a 
bereavement of an immediate family member (spouse, civil partner, 
mother, father, brother, sister, child, grandparent or grandchild) 
within 28 days of intended travel we will... make a refund.’

Last night the airline backed down and
apologised to Mr Parsons after he threatened to take the flight and 
strap an urn containing his mother’s ashes to what would have been her 
seat.

A spokesman said: ‘He was entitled to a
full refund, and this has now been sent to him, with our sincere 
apologies for the incorrect letter and inconvenience caused to him and 
his family.’

Mr Parsons said he was pleased that Ryanair had changed its mind.

He said: ‘It was never really about the money. It was all about the principle.

‘If they had not given me the money 
back, I would have booked my mother’s ashes on to the flight and 
strapped her in the seat that I had booked for her.

‘She had a valid passport so I don’t think there was any way they could have refused to take her ashes.

‘I would also have put the ashes in 
the wheelchair that I had reserved for her at the airport, and I would 
have filmed everything and posted the video on YouTube.

‘You expect to get a rough ride with 
these cheap airlines, but you don’t expect to get tied to a contract 
which is so far bent in the airline’s favour that you can’t conceivably 
win.’

He added that he will never travel with Ryanair again.
