The sight of rain in drought-stricken NSW is enough to make desperate farmers strip off their clothes in celebration - and enough to warrant a ban from Facebook.

James Rogers has been dubbed ‘The Naked Farmer’ after greeting last week's downpour in Cobar, in central-west NSW, where it hasn't rained for eight months, wearing nothing but a cowboy hat.

Farmer James Rogers rejoiced when it rained at his property in Cobar, NSW, for the first time in eight months.

James, 22,  told the Brisbane Times: 'I went and made a page for it and mine got blocked.

'I couldn't believe it... it was just a harmless joke and it kept going.There's much worse things on Facebook than that.

'I've done it all my life, pretty much, my mother can vouch for that. Every time it rained, me and my brother would be flat out running around in the rain and playing. But not always nude.'

The picture first appeared on the Station Photos Facebook page, a group with over 42,000 members showcasing rural life across Australia, but has since been removed by the social media site and the page was blocked for 24 hours because it was deemed 'explicit'.

James' mother Jenny was shocked by the ban, saying: ‘I really can’t see the problem. I see much, much worse things come up on my Facebook feed every day.’

Many Facebook users share Mrs Rogers’ opinion and since the picture's removal an online petition to ‘Bring Back The Naked Farmer’ has received over 800 signatures.

Facebook guidelines state that it does impose limitations on the display of nudity but aspired to 'respect people's right to share content of personal importance, whether those are photos of a sculpture like Michelangelo's David or family photos of a child breastfeeding'.
