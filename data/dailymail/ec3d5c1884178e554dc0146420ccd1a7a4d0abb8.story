A man accused of murdering his 11-month-old son blamed his dog for causing the child's death, a court heard.

Michael Beaumont, 29, a part-time gardener, claimed his son, Kadan, was ‘flipped over’ by Staffordshire terrier Mia before banging his head on the garden steps.

But the prosecution at Sheffield Crown Court said the head injuries, which saw Kadan die in hospital, were caused by Beaumont hours before he called an ambulance.

He told the court yesterday: ‘I saw 
Mia bang into him. It was really fast. I just remember Mia hitting the 
back of him and hitting his head on the step. He landed on the back of 
his head.

‘Kadan went over himself and did a back somersault and landed on his back on the concrete just below the bottom step.’

The court heard Beaumont sent a photo of his son’s injuries to the child’s mother, Helen Barnes, 28, while she was at work.

A
message with the picture said: ‘Look at my head mummy. Naughty Mia 
knocked me down the steps in the garden. I cut my neck as well. Don’t 
worry, daddy chased her round the garden and slapped her.’

The
father told the same story to his neighbours. One said Kadan ‘looked as
though he had been beaten up by Mike Tyson’, but the parents did not 
seek medical attention until the next day.

Kadan
died in Sheffield Children’s Hospital on September 28, 2011 where 
doctors found he had two recent fractures of the skull, bleeding in his 
eyes and on the surface of the brain as well as multiple bruises to his 
head and face.

Prosecutor Robert Smith QC said 
the dog story was untrue and Kadan’s death was ‘caused by someone 
striking him or throwing him against some surface shortly before the 
emergency services were called’.

Beaumont,
who has a six-year-old son from a previous relationship, told the jury 
he was ‘right happy’ when Barnes became pregnant with Kadan.

The court heard that when Kadan was born Beaumont had shared duties with the baby’s mother and also looked after her five-year-old son when she returned to work as a teaching assistant.

Asked if he had any experience of looking after babies before Kadan, Beaumont said: ‘I did, but not a right lot.’

Beaumont said Kadan’s fatal injuries were sustained as he was playing with the rabbits in the garden of the couple’s home at Chapel Street, Hoyland Common, Barnsley, and then crawled up the two steps on a path and stood up.

Beaumont blamed his Staffordshire terrier, Mia (not pictured), for killing his 11-month-old son, Kadan

‘He turned round and all I can remember, I looked up at the last minute and saw Mia bang into him,’ he said.

But the prosecution said Kadan was subject to regular violence from an early age and was taken to a GP when he was seven weeks old after coughing up blood.

A week later he was taken to hospital with a ‘cauliflower’ ear which a doctor suspected may have been caused by a punch.

When interviewed after Kadan’s death, Ms Barnes told police she had lifted Kadan over her shoulder two days previously and the baby ‘headbutted’ her. But experts told the court much more force would have been required.

The couple claimed Kadan also suffered bruising to his head two weeks previously when he fell out of a high chair in the kitchen as Beaumont fed him.

Mr Smith said the parents did not seek medical attention for Kadan because they were ‘fearful’ of the consequences.

‘Beaumont had deliberately inflicted those injuries to his son and falsely claimed to Barnes that the dog had been responsible,’ he said.

‘She had no excuse as a teaching assistant and mother for failing to take action to investigate those serious injuries and protect him from further abuse at the hands of Michael Beaumont.’

The court heard that just a few weeks previously Beaumont had ‘slammed’ his son down on a neighbour’s hard kitchen floor and said he was ‘stressed out and his son had to learn’.

Asked by Bryan Cox QC, defending, if he had done anything to injure Kadan, Beaumont said: ‘No. I tried to help him. I loved him and I miss him. I loved all my children very much.’

Beaumont denies murder and causing or allowing the death of a child. Barnes denies allowing the death of a child and cruelty to a person under-16.

The trial continues.
