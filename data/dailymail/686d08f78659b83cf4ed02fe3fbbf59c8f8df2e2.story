Lucky: Terrified motorist Kate Kirby thought she was being carjacked when two men ran up to her vehicle screaming at her to get out, but they turned out to be Good Samaritans who saved her life

A teacher who feared she was being carjacked was ordered out of her car by two good samaritans men just seconds before her BMW exploded.

Deputy headteacher Kate Kirby had failed to notice smoke rising from the wheel arch as she pulled up at a set of traffic lights in Gloucester.

But luckily two passing male motorists spotted the danger and frantically banged on her windows and ordered her out the car.

Convinced she was about to be mugged, Kate made a dash from the vehicle only to realised her ‘attackers’,  Darren and Kevin, were actually her saviours.

She would now like to track them down.

'If they hadn’t have told me to get out I would have carried on driving and then who knows what might have happened, I don’t want to think about it,' the 29-year-old said.

'I was so frightened because they shouted so loud.

'I just didn’t understand. If it was not for them I would have carried on driving.'

Mrs Kirby had been driving father-in-law Martin, 62, to Gloucester Royal Hospital in Gloucester for a routine endoscopy when the drama unfolded.

The pair had only been driving for a short while when the two men drew up next to them and began frantically screaming at them to get out the car.

Bemused Kate stared blankly at them trying to work out what to do before she instinctively pulled the car into the kerb as the men began to shout again.

They frantically climbed out of the car and it was then that they spotted the smoke rising from the wheel arch and bonnet.

'I was at the traffic lights and these two men started screaming at me to get out of the car,' she said.

'I stared at them and they told me to get out of the car now. I pulled the car in but I couldn’t get my seatbelt off quick enough, I was just fumbling around.

'When I did get out the car they told me to stand back.

Inferno: This is the deputy head's car just after the men got her and her father in law out of it as it burst into flames

'Then I saw the front of my car, the paint work was bubbling and the engine was going mad and making a noise. I don’t know how I didn’t see it.

Relieved: Mrs Kirby can't believe she walked away from the incident and would like to thank the men who rescued her

'I was a mess when I spotted it though, I was crying and panicking and hyper-ventillating like a child does when they’re crying so much, it was awful.'

Her father in-law added: 'I thought we were going to be mugged, it was only when we pulled up we saw the smoke.'

The two men apologised afterwards for making Kate cry and once they had made sure she was safely in another car, out of the pouring rain, began directing traffic away until emergency services arrived.

The cause of the blaze is unknown but the intense heat caused the road surface to melt.

Fire crews extinguished the blaze within 30 seconds and an ambulance crew treated Kate for shock.

The 10-year-old BMW 3 Series is now in a scrap yard and Kate is not sure when she will buy her next car.

'I just keep thinking about what would have happened if they hadn’t have been there, I would have kept on driving and then I don’t know,' the deputy head said.

'I can’t thank these two men enough, I’ve managed to get one of their mobile numbers but they’re not answering which is a shame.

'They have restored my faith in human nature by stopping to help and then offering me a coat and to sit in their car so I could get out of the rain.

'Sadly, I don’t know the full names of the other Good Samaritans, only that the girl was called Faye, but they were so helpful. I can’t thank them enough.'
