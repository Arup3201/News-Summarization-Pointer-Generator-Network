The man who allegedly killed 93 people in a massacre in Norway has been linked to the English Defence League (EDL).

Anders Behring Breivik, 32, wrote in one online post: 'I have on some occasions discussed with...  EDL and recommended them to use conscious strategies.

'The tactics of the EDL is to ''entice'' 
an overreaction from jihad youth/extreme Marxists, something they have 
succeeded [in] several times already.

Extremist: Anders Behring Breivik, with two unknown women, has been linked to the English Defence League

'The reaction has been repeatedly shown on the news which has boosted the EDLs ranks high.This has also benefited GDP. WinWin for both.'

Breivik has been described by police as 
'right wing and a Christian fundamentalist'. He posted a video promoting his extremist views just hours before a killing spree which 
left 93 people dead after a car bomb exploded in downtown Oslo and a gunman descended on a youth camp on the island of Utoya.

In another post online, Breivik analysed the differences between the EDL and the British National Party.

He also allegedly made contact with another far-right organisation, Stop the Islamification of Europe, according to the Sunday Telegraph.

The EDL is  an organisation with far-right views which opposes what it perceives as the spread of Islam and extremism.

The EDL has denied any connections with Breivik. The
 Norwegian branch released a statement saying: 'The terrorist 
acts are connected with a person who is against multiculturalism and 
Islam, we must emphasize that the suspect has never been a member of our
 organization.

Protest The EDL, at a demonstration earlier this year, have distanced themselves from the Norwegian mass murderer

'Our 
values are freedom of speech, equality, peace and democracy. It is our 
fear that the discussion will now end up in a track where our arguments 
are met with hatred and incoherent arguments.'

A post on Friday evening on the English 
Defence League Facebook page for the London area read: 'England will stand by 
Norway... We have an EDL man on the ground in Norway and will be in 
touch with the NDL. Let's pray the loss of life isn't high, although 1 single loss is to high. Our hearts go out to the dead & their families who are suffering :/ (dg)'

The revelation has led to the news that extra security will be put up at mosques around the UK, said British Muslim leaders.

Mohammed Shafiq, the leader of Ramadhan Foundation, one of Britain's largest Muslim groups, said mosques are being extra vigilant as it emerged that the suspect blamed for the Norway attacks opposed Muslim immigration to Europe.

Shafiq said he was talking to other European Muslim leaders about the need to increase security and to British police about extra protection.

'People are afraid that we will be the next target,' Safiq said in a telephone interview during a large gathering of Sunni scholars and leaders in northern city of Birmingham.

'As a result, we've told people to be extra vigilant and there will be added security placed at mosques.'

A pig's head was recently left at a mosque outside of Oxford, he added.

And anti-extremist group Hope Not Hate has called for the EDL to be 'formally classified as a far-right organisation' in the wake of the Norway attacks.

Director Nick Lowles said: 'Incredibly, the EDL are not currently classified as an extremist right wing group. That severely limits the capacity of the police to gather intelligence on the EDL, its members and its activities.

'Given the mounting evidence of connections between the EDL and alleged violent extremists like Anders Behring Breivik, we don't see how this situation is sustainable.'

Controversial: The English Defence League is a far-right organisation that is anti-Islam and anti-immigration

Breivik's estranged father, who has had no contact with his son since 1995, said he only learnt of his involvement via online newspapers.

The pensioner, who now lives in France, said: 'I was reading the online newspapers and suddenly I saw his name and picture on the net. It was a shock to learn about it. I have not recovered yet.'

Police have refused to comment on Breivik's motivation but in his 1,500-page manifesto, he mapped out various details including setting up an ultra-conservative newspaper and instructions for bomb-making.

In the text, titled 'A European Declaration of Independence', he wrote how he wanted to rid Europe of Islam and Marxism.

'It is better to kill too many than not enough, or you risk reducing the desired ideological impact of the strike,' he said.

'Do not apologise, make excuses or express regret for you are acting in self-defence or in a preemptive manner.'

He also called for a 'cultural Euro-Tea 
Party' referring to the grass-roots, right-wing organisation in the U.S.
 supported by Sarah Palin.

The manifesto also referred to a secret 
meeting in London in April 2002 to reconstitute the Knights Templar - 
skilled fighters endorsed by the Church who fought during the Crusades 
in the Middle Ages. They are sometimes revered by white supremacists.

It
 said the meeting was attended by nine representatives of eight European
 countries with another three members unable to attend, including a 
'European-American'.

The
 document does not name the attendees or say whether they were aware of 
Breivik’s planned attacks. It is thought that investigators will now try
 to determine if these people exist and what their connection is to 
Breivik.

According to the Daily Mirror, in another blog post from two years ago Breivik argued Muslim gangs in Norway are free to do what they want, while whites forming gangs are branded as racists.

He alleged that it led to him linking up with white criminal gangs and taking part in clashes against police.

The Norwegian prime minister, Jens Stoltenberg, said officials were working with foreign intelligence agencies to see if there was any international involvement in the slaughter.

'We have running contact with other countries' intelligence services,' he said.

BBC journalist Jon Sopel tweeted that a Scotland yard detective has arrived in Oslo to offer assistance during the investigation.

Norway police say Metropolitan police are helping with investigations.

Though the Norwegian far-right movement has carried out attacks in the past, it has historically been a small community.

The late Stieg Larsson, the Swedish crime writer famous for his Millennium trilogy started the anti-racist, anti-extremist publication Expo following a sharp rise in violence carried out by Scandinavian neo-Nazis in the 1990s.

It has been reported that Norwegian far-right extremists have developed strong links with criminal communities, as well as with similar groups abroad, in Europe, Russia and the U.S.

David Cameron said yesterday it was important for Britain to learn any lessons it could from the outburst of violence.

He said: 'The loss of life in Norway has been absolutely horrific; it's on a scale, frankly, that is hard to comprehend.

'The Norwegians are old friends and allies and neighbours of Britain, and I know that everyone in Britain will want to stand with the Norwegian people in the days of sorrow that lie ahead.

'Also, we will want to make sure that we learn, like others, any lessons there are to learn about how to be more secure against horrific outrages like this.'
