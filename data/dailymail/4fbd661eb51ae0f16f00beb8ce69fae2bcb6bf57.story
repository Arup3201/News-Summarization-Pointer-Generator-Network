The lingerie that Julia Roberts wore in her Oscar-winning performance as Erin Brockovich is currently up for auction online.

Auction house Nate D. Sanders is selling a custom-made bra and panties set worn by Ms Roberts in the 2000 film, with bids currently topping out at $1,665 on its site.

The black lace set was produced for Ms Roberts by Ultimo Miracle Solutions, which fitted their ‘Plunge Bra’ with silicone to allow the actress’s bosom to better resemble that of Ms Brockovich.

Following the film’s release - which grossed more than $28million in its opening weekend - the bra became Ultimo’s best-seller and was worn by multiple celebrities on the red carpet, according to Nate D. Sanders.

The movie, which detailed Ms Brockovich’s work as an environmental activist in California, apparently has at least four die-hard fans who would be willing to purchase Ms Robert’s used lingerie at a hefty price.
