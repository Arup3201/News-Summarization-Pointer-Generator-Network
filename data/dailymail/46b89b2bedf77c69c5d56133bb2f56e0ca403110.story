A return to the scene of past glories proved therapeutic for Tiger Woods on Thursday as he opened up with a useful 68 in the first round of the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational.

Woods is under severe pressure to deliver here to earn himself a place in the American Ryder Cup team.

The sight of him scoring well once more at Firestone, where he has won no fewer than eight times in the past, must have gladdened Ryder Cup captain Tom Watson, on the day he lost the services of Dustin Johnson.

Frustrated: but Tiger Woods is making progress as he battles back from injury

Steady start: Woods finished with a useful 68 in the first round in Akron, Ohio 

‘I’m a little frustrated that I didn’t take advantage of some great iron shots but I can see progress,’ said Woods. ‘This is only my seventh round back after surgery and I have to remember that.’

A huge crowd had gathered by mid-afternoon, as Woods made his way to the first tee. This was his first tournament since the worst 72 hole finish of his career in a major at The Open at Hoylake two weeks ago, as he seeks to make up for missing four months of the season following an operation on a herniated disc.

It looked like he was in for another poor round when he opened with a careless bogey from the middle of the first fairway, but rebounded instantly with a birdie.

Woods’s round came alive with three birdies in four holes from the fifth. At the 8th he almost holed his second shot, only to give back two of his gains with an ugly double bogey at the 9th.

The 38 year old was much more steady on the back nine, playing those holes in 33 shots to be tied ninth.

Leading the way is Australian March Leishman on 64 with Englishman Justin Rose one of three players who shot 65.
