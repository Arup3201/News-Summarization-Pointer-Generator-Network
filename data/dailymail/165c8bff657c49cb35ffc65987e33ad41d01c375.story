A Pennsylvania teacher who had sex with two students an flashed her breasts at another teen has been jailed for up to 23 months.

Lauren Harrington-Cooper enticed the students into sexual affairs by telling them: 'All the candy you need is right here.'

The married 32-year-old pleaded guilty to having sexual intercourse with an 18-year-old student in her car and also performing oral sex.

She also had sex with a 17 year old she had met while teaching in the Wyoming Valley West School district in Pennsylvania.

Harrington-Cooper, an English teacher, pleaded guilty to two counts of sexual contact with students and two counts of corrupting minors.

Prosecutors said she showed her breasts to a 17 year old and had sexual contact with another.

Harrington-Cooper was sentenced to nine to 23 months in jail, according to the Wilkes-Barre Times Leader newspaper.

Assistant District Attorney Jenny Roberts said the four victims had moved on with their lives.

'The defendant was in a position of authority with these students and she took advantage of that,' Roberts said. 'They're just happy to move on with their lives.'

Harrington-Cooper was first arrested in December on charges she had sex with an 18-year-old student.

The following month, investigators charged her with sending explicit text messages and performing oral sex on a 17-year-old boy.

She was also charged with two counts of corruption of minors for having 'sexually explicit conversations' with two other boys, aged 16 and 17.

School officials insisted no sexual contact took place on school grounds, but police said she made the remark about 'all the candy you want' while in school.

She did not speak at her sentencing in Wilkes-Barre, where she was pictured being escorted out in handcuffs.

Her attorney Joe D'Andrea, said that Harrington-Cooper accepted responsibility for her actions, apologized to the victims and that she would use her time in jail to reflect on her actions.

He said she suffers from 'self-image issues of acceptance and love.'

'She has been diagnosed with some significant psychological issues of inadequacy,' D'Andrea said.

'You would think that she's a pretty, young girl, that she would feel good about herself,' the attorney added. 'But her self-esteem issues have really troubled her all of her life, and she found comfort and solace in some people giving her attention, as wrong as it was.'

Luzerne County Judge Michael Vough said he hopes Harrington-Cooper can move on with her life after serving her time.

'You used your position of trust to exploit children,' Vough said.
