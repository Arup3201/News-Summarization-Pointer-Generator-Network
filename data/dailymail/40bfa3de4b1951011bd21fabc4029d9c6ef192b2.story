Health bosses in north Wales are urging patients to buy simple painkillers, laxatives and hayfever treatments rather than relying on free prescriptions

Patients in the Welsh NHS are being told not to use their free prescriptions – because of Labour's 'funding cuts'.

Hundreds of thousands of people who live in north Wales were yesterday urged not to ask their GP to prescribe a range of medicines for minor complaints, such as painkillers, laxatives and hay fever treatments.

Instead, patients are encouraged to 'self-care' and 'purchase some of the simple and inexpensive products over the counter for the treatment of minor ailments'.

The restrictions are being imposed because of the 'economic climate' and to 'cope with the funding cuts', the largest health board in the principality said yesterday.

Labour, which runs the Health Service in Wales as a result of devolution, has cut health funding by more than 8 per cent since 2010.

But in England, where the NHS is under the control of the Coalition, spending has risen slightly in real terms since the election.

The Daily Mail has focused on some of the adverse effects of the cuts including longer waits for ambulances, far more people waiting more than four hours in A&E than in England, and poor cancer care – with some Welsh patients being forced to move to England to get cancer drugs.

In January the strain on the Welsh NHS was highlighted when the furious wife of a paramedic posted online a photograph of at least ten ambulances – together with three rapid response cars – waiting outside Morriston Hospital in Swansea to unload patients at its overwhelmed A&E department.

Last night the leader of the Welsh Conservatives, Andrew Davies, said: 'Welsh Labour's savage cuts to the NHS have come at a time when spending has been protected in other parts of the United Kingdom, with obvious consequences.

'Not only have we recently witnessed the worst ambulance response times since records began, more patients than ever are waiting over 12 hours in A&E, and Welsh cancer patients continue to be denied access to life-saving drugs which are available in England under the Coalition's Cancer Drug Fund.'

Prescriptions are free to all in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, but in England a charge of £8.20 is applied unless the patient is exempt.

Pensioners and children are among those who do not pay for their prescriptions in England. 

Yesterday Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board, which covers much of north Wales, urged people no longer to ask their GP to be prescribed medicines they could buy over the counter at their local pharmacy.

Betsi Cadwaladr has asked GPs to reduce 'unnecessary prescribing of simple medications', including painkillers, laxatives, vitamins, hayfever and head lice treatments.

They say patients can purchase these drugs at a 'minimum cost', often more cheaply than it would cost the NHS to supply the drugs.  

The board said in a statement that, with the 'current economic climate putting a sharp focus on public spending', the local NHS needed to take 'tough decisions' to help address 'gaps in funding'.

Dr Berwyn Owen, clinical director of pharmacy and medicines management, said: 'Many of these [over-the-counter] products can be purchased at a minimum cost and often much more cheaply than it would cost the NHS.

'We spend £4million every year on over-the-counter medicines and this year we are experiencing a significant growth in their cost. A 2 per cent reduction would reduce our costs by an estimated £80,000, which at a time when the NHS is under constant pressure is a significant amount.

'We can make savings through encouraging patients to 'self-care' and to purchase some of the simple and inexpensive products over the counter for the treatment of minor ailments.'

He added that community pharmacists are highly trained and are in 'an ideal position to assist with 'self care', and offer advice on the most appropriate product for patients.

Dr Owen added that the board have asked GPs in the area to reduce unnecessary prescribing of these simple medications.

'However, be reassured that if your GP considers it essential that you take the medication for your condition, it will be prescribed to you,' he said.  

 'This will not only free up your GP's time, but will also reduce waste through the prescribing of additional quantities for use on a future basis or 'just in case'.

Conservative shadow health minister Darren Millar seized on Dr Owen's comments, telling the BBC they are 'recognition that Labour's universal free prescriptions policy is unaffordable and wastes vital funds which could be spent improving patient care'.

Geoff Ryall-Harvey, chief officer for the North Wales Community Health Council said: 'Our members welcome this drive by health boards, both locally and nationally, and see it as a positive way forward in reducing the huge amount of waste that comes from repeat prescriptions and stockpiling of medications by patients. 

'However, it is also reassuring that in some situations the doctor can still prescribe these medicines on the NHS.'

÷Doctors from the Clwyd North division of the British Medical Association have passed a vote of no confidence in the same Welsh health board over its plans to downgrade the maternity unit at Glan Clwyd Hospital in Bodelwyddan for 12 months.
