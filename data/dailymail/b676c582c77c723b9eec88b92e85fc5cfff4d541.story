As far as extreme sports go, this may seem a little on the wild side.

These vintage images capture dare devil bikers driving motorcycles around a so-called 'wall of death', built perpendicular to the floor.

And that's not forgetting the lions on board the vehicles, which sit neatly perched in makeshift side-carts as spectators gather to watch in awe.

Captured between the 1920s and 1960s, the photographs, which feature on the Retronaut website, show an event that became one of the most daring acts at fairgrounds and carnivals in the early 1910s in America.

The motorcycle craze - which peaked in the 1930s - began with single drivers circling around a wood-paneled motordrome at high speeds and completely vertical.

Over a hundred 'walls of death', as they became known, were traveling the US by the 1930s.

As organisers increased the angle of the
walls throughout the years, making them more steep, the number of 
serious accidents in turn increased.

One of the most popular versions of 
the sport was nicknamed the 'Liondrome', so-called because it featured a
rider accompanied by a tamed lion.

Traveling with a lion was always a 
risky business - as captured in these photographs - where lions and 
lionesses are seen letting out gigantic roars.

The drivers placed the animals in 
side-cars, unless they were small enough, in which case the lions were 
sometimes placed on the rider's lap.

One of the most difficult parts of the stunt was to induce the lion to remain quiet throughout the event.

After a number of accidents in which riders were injured or killed, it was decided the sport had become too dangerous and it ended.
