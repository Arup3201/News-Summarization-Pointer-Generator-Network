A spurned husband has posted a hilarious ad on gum tree to sell the wedding dress of his ex-wife which the ad says would suit ' a deceitful, double-dealing harlot'

The ad, written by the 32-year-old Sydney local government worker's friend with his full approval begins, 'Due to be married soon? Not planning on staying faithful? Want to sleep with one of your soon-to-be husband's closest friends? Then THIS is the wedding dress for you!'

'Bride seeking eventual infidelity': the gumtree ad was placed by 25-year-old Dan Campbell of Bradbury  in south-western Sydney on behalf of his friend, whose two year marriage broke up 12 months ago when his wife ran off with a close friend

The wedding dress was stored in the garage of the home Mr Campbell shares with his wife of one month, 24-year-old Alycia Campbell, who works for an air conditioning and refrigeration company

Mr Campbell, a 25-year-old refrigeration mechanic from the south-western Sydney suburb of Bradbury, said the man, who works in local government in Sydney, gave him full approval for the ad

Mr Campbell, a 25-year-old refrigeration mechanic from the south-western Sydney suburb of Bradbury, said the man, who works in local government in Sydney, gave him full approval for the ad which describes the 'stunning, tulle swathed, ivory bridal gown' as having 'a proven track record of producing a traitorous "soulmate".'

Mr Campbell said the man sent him a thumbs up text after reading the words he had penned, describing the dress as a 'one of a kind garment designed by Benedict Arnold, believed to be derived from the very cloth Judas Iscariot himself wore to the Garden of Gethsemane to betray the only son of God - Jesus Christ'.

Mr Campbell said the dress, a size 10-12, was worn only once, at the ill-fated wedding of his friend three years ago.

Mr Campbell said he wanted to protect the jilted groom's identity for fear of reprisals on the part of his mate's ex wife. 

'He was absolutely wrecked when it broke up. Then it got nasty, ' Mr Campbell said.

'He went through a lot of crap. They had a divorce settlement and he's happy now.'

'He was laughing actually when I told him about all the attention the ad's been getting.'

Mr Campbell predicted the dress would sell very soon.

'It's running hot, ' he said.

The money would go to his friend.

'All of it.'

'Harlot-sized' dress: After Dan Campbell's friend separated from his wife when she ran off with his close mate, Mr Campbell helped store the man's belongings in his Sydney garage. Mr Campbell found it during a clear out and suggested his friend could at least make some money selling it online, getting the spurned husband's approval for the ad which says the dress is a 'one of a kind garment designed by Benedict Arnold, believed to be derived from the very cloth Judas Iscariot himself wore to the Garden of Gethsemane to betray the only son of God - Jesus Christ'

'Bride seeking eventual infidelity': the gum tree ad placed by Dan Campbell on behalf of his friend has received more than 4000 hits on gumtree and a couple of genuine offers from women interested in the size 10-12 gown.  Mr Campbell says his friend is still single a year after the break up, but is 'living life and loving it'

Make an offer: The white and gold dress for sale on gumtree is, the advertisement says, 'guaranteed to provide you with approximately two years of reasonable wedded mediocrity before the complete and utter disintegration of your relationship due to your extramarital promiscuity'. The dress will also 'make you the envy of your trampish posse on your fraudulent wedding day' and 'is in better condition than the marriage' Offers for the gown are firming up around $300

Following the breakdown of the marriage 12 months ago, following the wife's infidelity with a friend of the groom, the rejected man stored a number of his possessions in Mr Campbell's garage.

The wedding dress was stored in the garage of the home Mr Campbell shares with his wife of one month, 24-year-old Alycia Campbell, who also works for an air conditioning and refrigeration company.

Mr Campbell found the dress among other items after he decided to have a clear out.

'I wanted to make some space for a new motor bike I bought and there were all these cardboard boxes,' he said.

'I went through them and found the dress and I said to my mate, "why don't you sell it. At least you could get some money out of [the failed marriage]".

'He agreed, good idea. So I wrote some words and sent them off to him for approval. He texted back saying, "haha, yeah, that's hilarious".'

The words Mr Campbell wrote for his friend said 'this dress is guaranteed to provide you with approximately two years of reasonable wedded mediocrity before the complete and utter disintegration of your relationship due to your extramarital promiscuity.

'This harlot-sized ensemble will make you the envy of your trampish posse on your fraudulent wedding day.

'As an added bonus, this dress gives you the "entitlement" to legally obtain over half of your husband-to-be's worldly possessions.

'Cosmetically, the garment is in better condition than the marriage - not looking for much. Make an offer.'

Mr Campbell has received several genuine inquiries about the dress from women asking the garment's size. He had not come to a price yet, but offers were firming around $300.

An added bonus was that he was receiving increased traffic on another ad he had placed on gumtree, for his old motor bike.

As for the ex groom and bride, Mr Campbell said the woman was still with the friend she had run off with, and the rejected groom was 'still single, but he's fine now. He's living life and loving it.'
