The captain of a ship caught smuggling missiles through the Panama Canal gave investigators a big heads up the North Korean vessel was up to no good.

As Panama authorities sought to board the ship, its panicked leader had a heart attack and tried to kill himself.

The 35 North Koreans aboard, meanwhile, did everything they could to resist arrest ahead of the discovery of weapons system parts buried under sacks of sugar.

And it was all over some seriously outdated equipment.

Clued in: Photos of the crew of the Chong Chon Gang hang in the ship. As suspicious Panama authorities went aboard to conduct a search, the ship's captain had a heart attack and attempted suicide

A private defense analysis firm that 
examined a photograph of the find said the ship appeared to be 
transporting a radar-control system for a Soviet-era surface-to-air 
missile system, and Cuba later called the equipment on the boat 
‘obsolete defensive weapons’ from the mid-20th century.

A
statement from Cuba's Foreign Ministry late Tuesday acknowledged that 
the military equipment belonged to the Caribbean nation, but said it had
been shipped out to be repaired and returned to the island.

It said the 240 metric tons of weaponry consisted of two Volga and Pechora anti-aircraft missile systems, nine missiles ‘in parts and spares,’ two Mig-21 Bis and 15 engines for those airplanes.

Photos of late North Korean autocrats Kim il-Sung and Kim Jong-il hang in many of the ship's crew quarters. All 35 crew members were arrested

‘The agreements subscribed by Cuba in 
this field are supported by the need to maintain our defensive capacity 
in order to preserve national sovereignty,’ the statement read.

It concluded by saying that Havana remains ‘unwavering’ in its commitment to international law, peace and nuclear disarmament.

Earlier,
Panamanian President Ricardo Martinelli said the ship identified as the
14,000-ton Chong Chon Gang was carrying missiles and other arms ‘hidden
in containers underneath the cargo of sugar.’

Martinelli tweeted a photo showing a green tube that appears to be a horizontal antenna for the SNR-75 ‘Fan Song’ radar, which used to guide missiles fired by the SA-2 air-defense system found in former Warsaw Pact and Soviet-allied nations, said Neil Ashdown, an analyst for IHS Jane's Intelligence.

‘It is possible that this could be 
being sent to North Korea to update its high-altitude air-defense 
capabilities,’ Ashdown said. Jane's also said the equipment could be 
headed to North Korea to be upgraded.

Panamanian
authorities said one container buried under sugar sacks contained radar
equipment that appears to be designed for use with air-to-air or 
surface-to-air missiles, said Belsio Gonzalez, director of Panama's 
National Aeronautics and Ocean Administration. An Associated Press 
journalist who gained access to the rusting ship saw green shipping 
containers that had been covered by hundreds, perhaps thousands, of 
white sacks marked ‘Cuban Raw Sugar.’

The U.N. Security Council has imposed four rounds of increasingly tougher sanctions against North Korea since its first nuclear test on Oct. 9, 2006.

Under current sanctions, all U.N. member states are prohibited from directly or indirectly supplying, selling or transferring all arms, missiles or missile systems and the equipment and technology to make them to North Korea, with the exception of small arms and light weapons.

The most recent resolution, approved in March after Pyongyang's latest nuclear test, authorizes all countries to inspect cargo in or transiting through their territory that originated in North Korea, or is destined to North Korea if a state has credible information the cargo could violate Security Council resolutions.

Powerful drug: The ship has been under scrutiny from international authorities since 2009 and Panamanian police originally boarded in the belief it carried drugs

‘Panama obviously has an important responsibility to ensure that the Panama Canal is utilized for safe and legal commerce,’ said Acting U.S. Ambassador Rosemary DiCarlo, who is the current Security Council president. ‘Shipments of arms or related material to or from Korea would violate Security Council resolutions, three of them as a matter of fact.’

Panamanian authorities believe the ship was returning from Havana on its way to North Korea, Panamanian Public Security Minister Jose Raul Mulino told The Associated Press. Based on unspecified intelligence, authorities suspected it could be carrying contraband and tried to communicate with the crew, who didn't respond. Martinelli said Panama originally suspected drugs could be aboard.

Everyone on the boat, called the Chong Chon Gang, were arrested after resisting police efforts to intercept the ship in Panamanian waters on Thursday as it moved toward the canal and take it to the Caribbean port of Manzanillo, Martinelli told private RPC radio station.

Panamanian officials were finally able to board the ship to begin searching it Monday, pulling out hundreds of sacks of sugar.

Luis Eduardo Camacho, a spokesman for Martinelli, said authorities had only searched one of the ship's five container sections, and the inspection of all the cargo will take at least a week. Panama has requested help from United Nations inspectors, along with Colombia and the UK, said Javier Carballo, the country's top narcotics prosecutor.

‘Panama being a neutral country, a country in peace, that doesn't like war, we feel very worried about this military material,’ Martinelli said.

The president announced the ship had been detained through Twitter

North Korea's government made no public comment on the case.

In
early July, a top North Korean general, Kim Kyok Sik, visited Cuba and 
met with his island counterparts. Cuban Communist Party newspaper Granma
said he was also received by President Raul Castro, and the two had an 
‘exchange about the historical ties that unite the two nations and the 
common will to continue strengthening them.’

The meetings were held behind closed doors, and there has been no detailed account of their discussions.

‘After
this incident there should be renewed focus on North Korean-Cuban 
links,’ said Hugh Griffiths, an arms trafficking expert at the Stockholm
International Peace Research Institute. Griffiths said his institute 
told the U.N. this year that it had uncovered evidence of a flight from 
Cuba to North Korea that travelled via central Africa.

‘Given
the history of North Korea, Cuban military cooperation and now this 
latest seizure, we find this flight more interesting,’ he said. ‘

The
Chong Chon Gang has a history of being detained on suspicion of 
trafficking drugs and ammunition, Griffiths said. Lloyd's List 
Intelligence said the 34-year-old ship, which is registered to the 
Pyongyang-based Chongchongang Shipping Company, ‘has a long history of 
detentions for safety deficiencies and other undeclared reasons.’

Undercover? The bags were labeled Cuban Raw Sugar

Not so sweet: Cuba officially identified the equipment late Tuesday as two Volga and Pechora anti-aircraft missile systems, nine missiles, two Mig-21 Bis and 15 engines for those airplanes

Satellite
tracking records show it left the Pacific Coast of Russia on April 12 
with a stated destination of Havana, then crossed the Pacific and the 
Panama Canal on its way to the Caribbean. It disappeared from satellite 
tracking until it showed up again on the Caribbean side of the canal, on
July 10, Lloyd's said.

The 
disappearance from satellite tracking indicates that the crew may have 
switched off a device that automatically transmits the ship's location 
after it moved into the Caribbean, Lloyd's said.

Mulino,
the Panamanian public security minister, said the ship crossed the 
Panama Canal from the Pacific to the Caribbean last month carrying a 
cargo of sheet metal that was inspected by Panamanian authorities.

Griffiths
said the Chong Chon Gang was stopped in 2010 in the Ukraine and was 
attacked by pirates 400 miles off the coast of Somalia in 2009.

Griffiths'
institute has also been interested in the ship because of a 2009 stop 
it made in Tartus - a Syrian port city hosting a Russian naval base.
