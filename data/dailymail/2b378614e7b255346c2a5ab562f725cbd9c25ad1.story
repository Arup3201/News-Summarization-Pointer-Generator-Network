A mystery structure being built on a barge floating off San Francisco's Treasure Island is fueling speculation that Google is turning its idea of a floating data center into a reality.

While the Internet company won't confirm the development, CNET reports it has evidence suggesting the four-story 'secret project' could be a Google sea-faring data center.

Google patented a 'water-based data center' in 2009, describing an environmentally friendly, sea-powered telecommunications and storage system.

'Secret project': While Google won't comment, experts say this four-story construction in San Francisco Bay looks like a data center

Is this is? A 2009 patent filed by Google shows a water-borne data center

Possible: This large structure on a barge just off Treasure Island, between San Francisco and Oakland, could be a floating data center being made by Google

'A system includes a floating platform-mounted computer data center comprising a plurality of computing units, a sea-based electrical generator in electrical connection with the plurality of computing units, and one or more sea-water cooling units for providing cooling to the plurality of computing units,' Google wrote in the patent.

Now, CNET investigative reporter Daniel Terdiman claims the mystery construction site floating in San Francisco Bay could belong to Google, drawing on evidence from lease agreements, expert consultations and interviews with locals.

He said putting data centers inside shipping containers, as he claims Google is doing, is already a well-established practice.

'The cutouts in the long walls of the containers, when they line up, they make hallways,' said Joel Egan, who designs similar structures. 'You could put all sorts of mainframes into the containers...It doesn't have enough windows for an office building'

While some commentators have criticized the reporter's evidence as circumstantial, experts say it's plausible that Google would build water-based data facility.

Joel Egan, the principal at Cargotecture, which designs custom cargo container buildings, said the structure looks like a data center.

'The cutouts in the long walls of the containers, when they line up, they make hallways,' Egan told CNET. 'You could put all sorts of mainframes into the containers...It doesn't have enough windows for an office building.'

Egan said that putting a data center on a barge would provide access to abundant water to help cool a large number of servers.

Jonathan
 Koomey, a Stanford research fellow and expert on data centers, said 
companies such as Dell, Hewlett-Packard, Sun Microsystems, and Microsoft
 have been installing specially built data centers in shipping 
containers for some time because they're easy to deploy.

Plans? Sources say Google hopes to tow the completed structure from Treasure Island across the Bay to San Francisco¿s Fort Mason, where it would be anchored and open to the public

Meanwhile, KPIX 5 reports that Google is 
actually building a floating marketing center at Hangar 3 for Google Glass, the cutting-edge wearable 
computer the company has under development.

KPIX 5 claims sources say Google hopes to tow the completed
 structure from Treasure Island across the Bay to San Francisco’s Fort 
Mason, where it would be anchored and open to the public.

The media outlet also reported that construction on the site, near the San Francisco Bay Bridge, stopped several weeks ago because Google does not have a permit to park the barge on the waterfront.

Construction on the site commenced last year, and the work is being shielded by a high security fence.

Another theory is that Google is building a floating marketing center at  for Google Glass, the cutting-edge wearable computer the company has under
