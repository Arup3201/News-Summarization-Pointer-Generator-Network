Hatem Ben Arfa has been stripped of the No 10 jersey at Newcastle United.

The French playmaker has been forced to train with the reserves this summer and manager Alan Pardew does not want him around his senior squad.

The Magpies boss has lost patience with Ben Arfa’s professionalism and has now given his favoured squad number to summer signing Siem de Jong, whilst the Frenchman has been given no 26 instead.

Waving goodbye? Hatem Ben Arfa is set to leave Newcastle this summer with a loan move to Lyon on the cards

Coming to England? Newcastle would like to use Ben Arfa in a deal to sign Lyon striker Alexandre Lacazette

Pardew would prefer it if the 27-year-old were to leave the club this summer and he has been offered to Lyon as a makeweight in a possible deal for striker Alexandre Lacazette.

Newcastle would have to pay a portion of the 27-year-old’s £50,000-per-week wages should he join Lyon on loan, while a fee of around £15 million has been quoted for pacey frontman Lacazette, who scored 23 times last season.

Breakthrough: 18-year-old winger Rolando Aarons has been very impressive in pre-season for the Magpies 

Meanwhile, one of the players who could replace Ben Arfa in the first-team is Rolando Aarons.

The 18-year-old has been handed the No 16 shirt for this season and looks set to be involved when United take on Manchester City a week on Sunday.

Sportsmail revealed earlier in the week how the exciting winger could be the subject of a country-versus-country row with him eligible to play for Jamaica – where he was born – and England.

And it now appears Jamaica have made the first move after boss Winfried Schaefer tweeted Aarons with a message to telephone one of their coaches
