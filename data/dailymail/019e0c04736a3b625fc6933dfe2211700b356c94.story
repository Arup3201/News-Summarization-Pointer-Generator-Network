A young woman who was born with a painful club foot made the drastic decision to have her leg amputated - so she could wear high heels for the first time.

Born with her left leg painfully twisted Mariah Serrano, 21, was told by doctors that her condition meant she would never wear high heels or be able to pursue her dream job in fashion.

Determined, Miss Serrano, from New York, decided to have the lower half of her leg surgically removed and replaced with a prosthetic limb.

Now she can wear all types of footwear including high heels and sandals.

She said: ‘It was hard to get used to [high heels], but even girls without foot and leg problems have to learn to wear heels for the first time. I've never felt so glamorous or empowered.

‘When I was told I'd never be able to wear high heels and I should give up my dream career, I was devastated.

Before and after: Miss Serrano (left before the amputation) had five operations by the age of 16 to correct her club foot but her condition remained unchanged until now - after surgery (right) she is able to wear high heels for the first time

‘The specialist said there was another option - to have my leg amputated. Mum was horrified but I couldn't get the idea out of my head. I had to give it some serious thought.’

In most cases, club foot is corrected in childhood by bracing or surgery but by the time Miss Serrano was 16-years-old her condition remained despite enduring five operations.

Miss Serrano said: ‘I was sick and 
tired of wearing leg braces. Because one foot was much smaller than the 
other, shoes were a real issue. 

‘I
 was forced to wear trainers at my high school prom when I was 17. I 
couldn't help but feel jealous of my friends who were wearing heels.’

'Couldn't get the idea out of my head': Miss Serrano was tired of wearing leg braces and not being able to wear normal shoes because one foot was bigger than the other (left) until a doctor suggested amputation which has enabled her to wear high heels (right). Now she owns 10 pairs

In April 2009 she saw a specialist who talked her through the options for amputation.

She said: ‘For the first time I began to think I could actually go through with it, but I was still terrified. 

‘It wasn't until I read an article about my favourite designer Alexander McQueen, who'd made a pair of prosthetic legs for the athlete Aimee Mullins that I knew what I had to do.

‘I realised that a beautifully-crafted prosthetic could look good. I made up my mind. At that moment I chose to chop off my leg.’

The woman underwent the surgery in the summer of 2009 and post-surgery there were some early-stage complications as the wound struggled to heal which led to moments of regret.

She said: ‘I wondered what on earth I'd done. I didn't go out and didn't want my friends to come over and see me. It was really hard.'

By the winter the wound had improved and she was given her first pair of heels as a gift by her mother Patricia, father Emilio, sisters Isabella and Fiona and brother Mason.

She said: ‘They were white basket woven Alice + Olivia platform wedges. As I teetered around the living room wearing them I knew I'd done the right thing.

Out and about: Miss Serrano (pictured with friends) said she sometimes feels self-conscious about her prosthetic limb but it has given her the confidence to achieve what she wants from life

Inspired by fashion designer: While considering the amputation, Miss Serrano read about fashion designer Alexander McQueen and the pair of prosthetic legs he made for athlete Aimee Mullins (pictured left modelling the prosthetic limbs and right running with blades) and said she 'knew what I had to do'

Shortly after her operation Miss Serrano landed a job at top fashion label Betsey Johnson. 

She now works as a social media manager in the fashion industry and owns 10 pairs of high-heeled shoes. 

She said: ‘Choosing to have my leg cut off was the hardest thing I've ever done. I still wake up sometimes and wonder where it is. 

‘I've lept out of bed, forgetting that I don't have my leg, and have fallen over. It's still something I'm getting used to. 

‘I've learned not to take my prosthetic too seriously. My friends are always joking around with my fake leg. 

‘Sometimes I feel self-conscious but my prosthesis has given me so much more confidence and helped me to achieve the life I wanted.’
