Model, TV presenter and homeware designer... is there anything that Holly Willoughby can't do?

The national sweetheart, who wakes up the nation on This Morning, has added another string to her bow by designing a range of vintage-inspired clothes for babies.

Speaking to FEMAIL about her latest project with BHS, Holly, 34, said: 'It’s something I have been passionate about for quite some time; this project has been about 18 months in the making. 

'I have a style that I have tried to bring into this range, which I hope feels fresh and blends the modern with vintage.'

Holly Willoughby, 34, has extended her homeware range with BHS and has now ventured into designing a range of baby clothes inspired by vintage pieces and her own childhood memories 

The range, which lands in stores next week, has a strong vintage feel running throughout and each piece has an element that is reminiscent of a bygone era, from delicate frills to smart pinstripes.  

The mother-of-three, who created Pinterest boards to garner inspiration, said she worked extremely  hard to ensure her range was full of great pieces that accounted for the practical needs of a mother and baby.

To ensure the very best quality and comfort, Holly used only natural fibres to create breathable garments that she says will keep little ones cool throughout the summer months. 

'My main desire was for the collection to conjure up nostalgic memories from childhood such as swimming in the sea or trying ice cream for the very first time,' she said.

Holly says she loves the ditsy dresses, which cost £10, and would dress her daughter in one if she were younger

Holly, who is mother to Harry, Belle and Chester, certainly has experience when it comes to dressing little ones - and said she designed her new range with her own offspring in mind. 'I love the vintage florals, the soft tones and the fresh cotton dresses,' she said.

'I definitely like that look of soft colours, nothing too fussy or busy. My favourite pieces for girls are the ditsy floral dress and the grey woven romper; if Belle was a bit younger I would love to see her in those.

'I am very excited to see Chester in the boy's pieces, I have ordered the whole range!'. 

If that wasn't keeping her busy enough, the presenter managed to find time to extend her home range with Sir Philip Green's high street store, too. 

Speaking about the additions to her homeware range, which has a similar vintage theme to her baby range, Holly said: 'We have added quite a few things! We have thought about accent things for each room that you can layer in and build on your own look.

'There are some incredible statement lights that you could pop into any room. It’s not about chucking everything out and creating a brand new look in your house, I don’t think that is practical or right. A home is what you build over years and years. 

'I like collecting things along the way and making them work within what I already have; I guess that is why I have chosen such a mix of pieces but I think that they do all sit well together.'

The range has a vintage theme - much like her baby range - and Holly says decorating her bedroom to help her feel calm and relaxed is essential

Holly, who says her bedroom is her 'favourite place' in the house, added: 'My sleep is very precious to me so I do treat it like it is a sanctuary. I simply swear by trying to get a good night’s sleep every night... not that it's always easy when you have a young family!

'Candles are very important, it just instantly makes a room nice so you feel calm and relaxed.' 

The  new mother may have been keeping busy with her BHS projects but she's not putting her feet up just yet.

'There is lots more I want to do,' revealed the ambitious Celebrity Juice presenter.

'Both of these projects have been a long-standing passion and I would love to keep building on this. I have lots and lots of ideas that I keep as Pinterest boards and I have stacks of magazines I love to look through for inspiration. 

'I just feel so lucky I got this chance to see ideas come to life and be able to finally buy the things I have had trouble finding in the past. I just hope that everyone else likes it too and I can’t wait to see it in store.'
