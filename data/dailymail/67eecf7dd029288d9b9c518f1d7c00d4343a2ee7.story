The BBC privately chartered a plane to fly its team of star presenters to tonight’s game.

Gary Lineker, Mark Lawrenson and Alan Hansen made the trip from Warsaw to Kiev yesterday.

The trio, who had previously been covering the tournament from Manchester, had taken a chartered flight to Poland on Friday.

A BBC spokesman insisted the private charter was saving licence fee-payers’ money because it meant the Corporation could cut down on accommodation costs.

She also said there was a shortage of space on scheduled flights.

Interest in flights to the Ukraine capital surged yesterday as fans' low expectations were turned around after England won its group stage of the tournament.

Fans swamped travel websites to secure their place in the Olympic Stadium when England take on Italy on Sunday.

Website CheapFlights reported an 800 per cent increase in inquiries for flights in the three hours before, during and after England's win over Ukraine on Tuesday.

The cheapest flights available from London to Kiev - for just under £400 - were those going via other European cities with a stopover.

The cheapest direct London-Kiev flight was £577, going out with Alitalia on June 23, the day before the game, and returning with KLM on June 25, the day after the game.

Other direct flights available on the same dates were £590 with Luthansa and Austrian Airlines.

The cheapest direct flight landing on the day of the game, June 24, was £540 with Swissair.

For those fans willing to spend up to 18 hours travelling, a £394 flight with a stopover and long wait in the airport lounge at Paris was available via flight comparison website Skyscanner.

The Football Association's official licensed tour operator Thomson Sport yesterday chartered an extra plane for its £649 per person 24-hour trip for the quarter-final after the package sold out.

But this package did not come with a match ticket, so fans had to find one of those on their own. It did include the cost of return flights and transfers between the airport and stadium.

Skyscanner reported a massive surge in flight searches to Ukraine late on Tuesday night as Wayne Rooney fired England into the quarter-finals.

Overall searches on the day of the big match against Poland were yesterday up 120 per cent compared to the day before, with flight searches doubling between 8pm and 10pm as expectation levels soared.

It is flights that are the expensive part - once these have been purchased, England fans can buy tickets to the quarter-final from Uefa's official website for as little as £33.

England's victory over Ukraine on Tuesday was watched by 18.5million people on ITV1, the biggest viewing figure of the year so far.

The final match of the group stage of Euro 2012 eclipsed the 17million who tuned in to watch the Diamond Jubilee concert earlier this month.

The BBC will now be hoping to set a new 2012 record when it airs England's quarter-final match against Italy on Sunday.

Prince William could be heading to Euro 2012 if England beat Italy tonight. Palace aides confirmed they have been in touch with the Foreign Office, whose advice they must seek before the Prince travels, and the situation is ‘under review’.

The semi-final is in Warsaw on Thursday.

BBC pundit Alan Hansen was told to borrow a shirt from colleague Mark Lawrenson after his luggage went missing. TV anchor Gary Lineker tweeted: ‘Slight hiccup at Warsaw airport. Alan Hansen’s luggage didn’t show up. He could always borrow one of Lawro’s shirts.’

Match Of The Day presenter Gary Lineker, the face of Walkers crisps in the UK – which are called Lays in many countries – tweeted: ‘Early flight to Kiev. Just saw Polish Walkers/Lays advert at the airport. It stars Szczesny, the Arsenal goalie. Don’t get any ideas Mr Hart.’

Italy's Alessandro Diamanti takes his own hairdryer to every match, earning the nickname ‘The Hairdryer’ from teammates. It’s one better than England’s Wayne Rooney – who celebrated scoring the winning goal against Ukraine by ‘spraying’ hair gel on his £30,000 hair transplant.

Hundreds of fans claim they are victims of fraud after booking online hotels and bed and breakfast accommodation in Donetsk and Kiev that did not exist. A spokesman for Booking.com acknowledged the complaints and said: ‘We have moved to resolve these matters as quickly as possible.’

England striker Jermain Defoe – now back with the team after his father’s funeral – has suffered a second family tragedy. His 16-year-old cousin Shervon Poleon died from a head wound after an alleged attack at his school in St Lucia. Defoe lost his father Jimmy, 47, to throat cancer.
