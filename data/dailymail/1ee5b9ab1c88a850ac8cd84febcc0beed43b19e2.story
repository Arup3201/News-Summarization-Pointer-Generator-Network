David Beckham has always been in a class of his own in the looks department and now a new survey has proved it... sort of!

According to the new research, the majority of men change their hairstyle only three times in their adult lives, with just two per cent saying they change their locks as often as Becks.

Nevertheless, while men don't change their hair as often as Beckham, they do want to look like him, with 37 per cent saying that the footballer always has great hair.

Though men change their hair on average once every six years, almost half of all women go for the chop annually.

One in six refresh their style four times a year – virtually every time they go to a salon – and have clocked up more than 50 hairstyles by the age of 35.

The results came in a poll of 1,000 men and women carried by the Crown Clinic in Manchester, which specialises in hair transplants.

The poll also looked at the reasons why people change their hair, which for men included being bored with the way they look (36 per cent), hair loss (12 per cent) and changing fashion (15 per cent).

Just 12 per cent said they changed 
their hair because of celebrity influences, unlike women - 45 per cent 
of whom said they got a new style in homage to a star.

Particularly popular is presenter Holly Willoughby, who, according to researchers, subtly changes her look all the time
 and has had 20 different styles since the age 
of 18.

Other reasons included changing fashions (42 per cent), being fed up with bad hair days (32 per cent), needing a change (26 per cent) and going grey (16 per cent) .

According to the Crown Clinic's Dr Asim Shahmalak, who has previously performed hair transplants on Embarrassing Bodies star Christian Jessen and model-turned-actor, Calum Best, men are increasingly turning to transplanted follicles to stave off baldness.

He said: 'Up to 30 per cent of men start losing their hair by the time they are 30. Thankfully, the days of them combing over their bald patch like Bobby Charlton are well behind us.

'These days men losing their hair often shave their heads to cover up their baldness. However, increasing numbers – inspired by people like Wayne Rooney – are opting for hair transplants.

'Maybe they don’t suit  the shaven-headed look or it doesn’t suit their job. How many lawyers have you seen with a crew cut?

'Many men simply don’t want to have the 
same hair style for the rest of their lives and a transplant gives them 
lots more options.'
