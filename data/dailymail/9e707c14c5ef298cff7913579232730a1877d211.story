 A porn video that a former student made in the stacks of the Oregon State University library is getting university administrators hot under the collar.

Kendra Sunderland, 19, became the talk of campus when she posted a video on PornHub that showed her stripping out of her top and touching herself for 31 minutes in the crowded Valley Library in Corvallis, Oregon.

The clip became a sensation on campus - passed around among students on social media. It was viewed more than 260,000 times in just a few days before PornHub took it down, KEZI-TV reports.

Kendra Sunderland, 19, was arrested and charged with public indecency after she posted a 31-minute porn video she made in the Valley Library at Oregon State University 

Many students expressed shock that she was able to perform so long in the crowded library without anyone noticing

University administrators were furious that a a former used the Oregon State campus to film a porn video

This week, the Oregon State Police arrested Sunderland on a charge of public indecency. She was cited and released. 

Some students were dismayed at the infamy Sunderland brought to campus. Others were amused. Many, though, were surprised she was able to get away with filming a porn in the crowded library for half an hour without being caught by anyone.

'I feel like it’s always packed. I don’t know how anyone could get away with it,' student Shelby Wilson told KEZI. 

University spokesman Steven Clark said monitors patrol the campus library - but they can't be everywhere at once. 

'Imagine six floors; 340,000 square feet. It’s used by 30,000 people on average every week,' he told KEZI.

Sunderland joins a long list of college students who have taken educational detours into porn. Most famous is perhaps Belle Knox, the Duke University student who says she started doing porn to pay her tuition. 

Florida State University student Mia Khalifa recently made headlines for revealing she has gotten death threats in her native Lebanon for her porn career. 

Sunderland was given a citation and then released with orders to appear in court to answer the charges

Sunderland was not longer a student at the university when she filmed the video, administrators say
