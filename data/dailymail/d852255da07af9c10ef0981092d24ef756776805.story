The disturbing world of amateur pornography has been laid bare by a new documentary called 'Hot Girls Wanted,' which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival on Saturday.

The insightful look at the world of pornography shows just how easy it is for teenagers, in particular, to get caught up in a sex trade that promises big bucks and fame.

But in a revealing peek into the billion dollar industry, documentary filmmakers exposed how professionally produced films are being made to look like home movies.

'Hot Girls Wanted,' was shot by Jill Bauer and Ronna Gradus, and produced by Rashida Jones.

It showed how Craigslist ads which promised free flights to Miami bring in a constant stream of would-be porn stars.

During the film, Riley, a 23-year-old 'agent' hosts half a dozen young women eager to enter the industry at his Miami home.

He says casually: 'Every day, another girl turns 18.'

But the brutal world of pornography only gives girls aged 18- to 21 a career span that typically lasts just three months, due to high turnover.

Tressa, an 18-year-old girl featured in the film, admits she was attracted to porn as a way to escape her Texas hometown.

She said she earned $25,000 in her four months in the industry, but after paying for lingerie, manicures, makeup and biweekly STD tests, she only had about $2,000 in her bank account when she quit the business.

'It's easy to take advantage of an 18-year-old girl,' she said. 

However, for some teenagers, the allure proves just too much, and many, who have grown up in the age of the Internet don't have many hang-ups about becoming adult stars.  

Worryingly, many appear to think that there is nothing wrong with being shot on film and have the attitude 'Why not get paid? We're doing it anyway.'

And as pop culture has become more and more sexualized, it can even be seen as a badge of honor to partake in the sex industry. 

According to online porn sites, 'teen' is the most searched term in online pornography, and thousands of young people enter the amateur porn industry every day. 

The filmmakers said that according to current laws, it's legal for anyone with a camera who calls himself a porn producer to solicit sex. 

The woman is technically being paid for her 'performance,' not the sex act.
