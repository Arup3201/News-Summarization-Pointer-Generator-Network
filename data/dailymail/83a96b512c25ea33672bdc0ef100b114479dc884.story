Scientists have questioned Miley Cyrus's ability to arrive 'like a wrecking ball' - pointing out she would have to travel at  over 316 mph to cause a similar impact, and risk death in the process.

A science student carried out the analysis, warning 'any human behaving like a wrecking ball would likely result in serious injury.' 

'Based on these findings, it is clear that a human being cannot possess the characteristics of a wrecking ball without sustaining significant injury, and other objects should be sought as an analogy,' he warned the songstress.

Are you sure Miley? Scientists have questioned Miley Cyrus's ability to arrive 'like a wrecking ball'

Students analysed the movement of a wrecking ball to find how fast a human would need to move to recreate its effects

The study, called 'The viability of arriving like a wrecking ball' was carried out by third-year natural sciences student David McDonagh from The Centre for Interdisciplinary Science at University of Leicester.

'A pop song that made the charts in late  2013 alludes to the idea of entering a given location analogous to a wrecking ball, raising questions over if such a feat is possible,' he wrote.

'Perhaps more  significantly,  the singer claims to have impacted both love and ostensibly the walls of someoneâ€™s house with similar momentum at some point, providing a somewhat unique case in studying the effects of shock on human beings.'

Experts analysed the impact of a real wrecking ball for the study

The researchers admit that music is littered with scientific impossibilities.

'Popular music has a rich history of musicians stating extraordinary feats, from The Beatles claiming an eight-day week to Westlife achieving human flight without wings.

'Such claims must follow the basic known principles of science if they are to be believed, and can often be investigated through simple approximations.
