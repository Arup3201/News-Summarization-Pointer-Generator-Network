Not for the first time, Newcastle United have done the bulk of their summer spending in the duty free European aisle.

It is a prudent ploy: they pick up quality goods at a competitive price, repackage them as a Premier League commodity and place them in the 'Sports Direct' window perused by the Champions League elite.

This year's continental sweep, however, has bought manager Alan Pardew the one stock he so desperately craves – time.

New boys: Karl Darlow (right) and Jamaal Lascelles (left) are Alan Pardew's latest acquisitions

Seven new signings - plus yesterday's 
arrival of Jamaal Lascelles and Karl Darlow from Nottingham Forest, who 
will return on loan - have lifted the depression which had descended in 
the second half of last season, a period in which the Magpies won just 
five of 21 matches, Pardew headbutted Hull's David Meyler and 2,000 fans
 protested against the regime by walking out during the final home game.

But the uprising fell flat and a steady stream of summer unveilings have, for now, quelled the dissenters.

Optimism
 on Tyneside, however, will always be tempered while Pardew and owner 
Mike Ashley are in power; time, then, is a provisional luxury, no matter
 the six years remaining on the manager's contract.

Les Ferdinand – who scored 50 goals for United in the mid-Nineties - agrees.

'The jury is still out on the manager and the signings,' he told the Mail on Sunday, 'and a good start is huge for them.

'But
 I've always had sympathy with Alan Pardew and I think he hasn't been 
helped at all by the owner in the past couple of seasons.

'He hasn't had the money when he's needed it and they've struggled because of that, it's frustrating.'

Respected
 radio commentator Mick Lowes has covered the club for more than 20 
years and, while siding with Ferdinand, he feels Pardew is now under 
pressure to return on the £30million investment.

On the hunt: The Newcastle manager has made seven summer signings so far

'There
 was always a feeling that he was a manager operating with one hand tied
 behind his back – well that hand has been loosened now,' he said.

'Last
 season will not be forgotten if they start badly, but the fixture 
computer has been kind and he has to take advantage of that. There is no
 excuse that he has not been backed by the owner this time.'

And
 what of that backing? To give the sudden splurge some perspective, the 
arrival of Ayoze Perez from Tenerife for £1.6million in June was the 
club's first permanent signing in 17 months. So it was due.

Their
 soccer-market sweep has again seen them journey down the autoroutes of 
the continent, picking up France midfielder Remy Cabella and Holland 
internationals Daryl Janmaat and Siem de Jong, as well as Monaco striker
 Emmanuel Riviere, Argentine forward Facundo Ferreyra and, a lot closer 
to home, Jack Colback from Sunderland.

And
 BBC Newcastle's Lowes added: 'In terms of numbers and quality it's 
better than we ever expected. The likes of Cabella, Janmaat and De Jong 
are top-class players and fit that mould of Yohan Cabaye and Mathieu 
Debuchy, internationals who were then sold for a big profit.'

Jury still out: Les Ferdinand (left) believes a good start is crucial for under-fire Pardew

Ferdinand
 admits to a sense of anticipation, although he is scarred by the 
experience of Spurs. They splashed more than £100m on seven new players 
12 months ago but both Andre Villas-Boas and then Tim Sherwood – 
assisted by Ferdinand – were sacked before the season's end.

'You
 look at the players Newcastle have brought in and you'd say it's been a
 very good summer and I can see why fans might be excited again,' he 
said.

'I have been to watch Siem de Jong play for Ajax a good few times and he is a top player.

'It will be interesting to see how that translates to the Premier League because I thought he was very good in Holland.

'But I was at Spurs last year and we spent a lot of money on new signings and everyone expected us to challenge for the league.

'It
 didn't happen that way and you'll probably find Spurs come back better 
this season for those lads having had a year to settle in.

'That could be the same at Newcastle, but has the manager got that time?'

The
 answer to Ferdinand's question, of course, is dependent on results. The
 United boss has been afforded more time than many anticipated – new 
signings have helped see to that.

But time and goodwill have a limited shelf-life at St James' Park. Pardew must hope his new goods are not faulty.
