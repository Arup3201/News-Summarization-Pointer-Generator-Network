With a fleet of fast cars, a vast property empire and income of £1million a month, drugs baron John Clark had grown accustomed to living in the lap of luxury.

So when he was charged with money laundering, Clark promptly fled the country in his £150,000 Bentley Continental with a suitcase full of designer clothes to seek refuge in his plush Tenerife villa.

Yesterday he was finally behind bars after the National Crime Agency found the 35-year-old fugitive holed up at a luxury hotel in Morocco.

John Clark moved more than £1million worth of Class A drugs around Britain, while he lived in Spain

The criminal kingpin went on the run to Tenerife after he was spotted with a huge amount of cash, but was brought back to Britain and jailed for 25 years today. This picture of a villa was found on his mobile phone by police.

On Clark's phone officers found pictures like this one of him in his Audi R8 Spyder, which is worth £120,000

Officers covertly watched Clark hand over a bag containing £113,860 to a money launderer at a service station on the M6 in October that year - the cash was later seized

The father of two was jailed for 25 years after admitting money laundering and conspiracy to supply class A drugs as details emerged at Bolton Crown Court of his extraordinary lifestyle.

When police raided his three-storey, seven-bedroom mansion in Waterfoot, Lancashire, they found shoe boxes stuffed with £77,000 of cash, money counting machines and a ledger recording deposits of £11.25million in just nine months between March 2012 and January 2013.

The Honorary Recorder of Bolton, Judge Timothy Clayson said some of the transaction sizes were ‘astonishing’, with £1.35million racked up over just 40 days from supplying vast amounts of cocaine, heroin and amphetamines smuggled in from the Continent.

With the proceeds from a drugs empire which stretched from Scotland to London and Merseyside to Lincolnshire, Clark splurged on a £1.2million farmhouse with stunning views over a 22-acre plot, which included 19 stables.

Advertised as ‘enjoying a rare degree of privacy’ with a private gated driveway and a CCTV and alarm system, estate agents boasted the property also offered ‘phenomenal secure garaging facilities for the most ardent car enthusiast/collector’. 

Clark soon set about filling the garages with a £120,000 Audi R8 Spyder, a £150,000 Bentley Continental, a £250,000 convertible Bentley Azure, a £44,000 Audi RS3 and his and hers £65,000 Range Rover Sports, with a black model for himself and white one for his glamorous wife Angela, 30 

Clark's £1.2million farm in Waterfoot was raided as part of a probe into members of a money-laundering gang

During the raid on Clark's farm investigators found £77,000 in two shoeboxes as well as documents showing Clark had an impressive property portfolio and had recently purchased a new Audi R8 Spyder worth £120,000

Police also found a ledger which detailed just nine-month's worth of illegal transactions - in which Clark's gang had moved £11million worth of drugs

He lavished thousands on refurbishments, decorating his home with zebra print wallpaper, chaise longues, signed boxing memorabilia and jacuzzi baths in five en-suite bathrooms.

He also snapped up a further eight rental properties across Lancashire worth as much as £200,000 each, as well as several luxury villas in Spain and ‘an impressive property portfolio throughout Europe’, police believe.

But his lifestyle attracted the attention of the NCA. They spent months with the Serious and Organised Crime Group of Greater Manchester Police carrying out surveillance and saw Clark hand over bags of cash to his cohorts at an M6 service station in 2011.

Over the coming months, his henchmen were caught smuggling heroin, cocaine and amphetamines worth more than £11million into the UK.

Fearing the net was closing, Clark fled while on bail in January last year, driving his Bentley to France and taking refuge at his Tenerife villa.

Officers investigating the case found Clark had amassed a fleet of luxury cars, including this Range Rover

A police raid on Clark's found plenty of incriminating evidence including cash and documents

Investigators eventually tracked him down in June 2013 after they followed his wife to the five-star hotel in Morocco where he was staying.

Clark later moaned about spending 316 days in a crowded Morocco jail before being extradited to Britain.

Hugh Barton, defending, told the court how Clark lived in ‘appalling conditions’ having to share his cell with up to 60 other inmates.

But the judge was unsympathetic about the plight of Clark, who had previously been jailed for four years for supplying cocaine in 2003.

Clark (pictured in one of his luxury cars) lived a 'playboy' lifestyle with the money he earned from running the multi-million pound drugs gang

Judge Clayson told him: ‘This is an instance of money laundering on a very large scale, all related to the vast profits flowing from your drug dealing operations. In my view your culpability is clearly high as you had a leading role.’

Eight other members of the gang were sentenced last October for a combined total of 88 years.

Jim Cook, lead investigator for the National Crime Agency, said: ‘Clark’s lavish lifestyle is over. Not only has he been deprived off his freedom, he now faces losing his criminal assets.

‘We have restrained nine properties so far including his luxury multi-million pound family home. Our financial investigation is ongoing.’
