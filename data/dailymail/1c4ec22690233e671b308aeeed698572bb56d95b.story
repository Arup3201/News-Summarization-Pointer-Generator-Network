 A 15-year-old froze to death just yards from his home after police failed to conduct a thorough search following reports of screams at 2am, an inquest heard.

Leon Cudworth was discovered in an alley in Oldham, Manchester at 7.30am on February 15 after braving temperatures of three degrees celcius wearing nothing but a flimsy jacket, T-shirt, jeans and shoes following a night out drinking with friends.

His cause of death was ruled as hypothermia and acute alcohol intoxication by Home Office pathologist Dr Philip Lumb.

Neighbours had awoke at 2am to hear a boy crying and shouting 'Dad, Dad' and called police.

But responding officers admitted they did not examine the area fully telling the inquest that in hindsight 'we should have done more.'

Leon Cudworth (pictured) was found dead on February 15, just yards from his home, after he is believed to have succumbed to hypothermia following a night out with pals

The tragedy occurred on Valentines Day this year after the popular schoolboy went for a night out at Aspins and Danielles bars in the Lees area. The teenager spoke with his father Michael at around 11.30pm telling him he was in a wine bar and would be home around midnight.

But one of his neighbours on Ripponden Road, Oldham awoke in the early hours of February 15 and heard noises coming from the back of her house which overlooks an unlit alleyway. Tracy Royal said that she had heard a number of bangs adding: 'It was like a punching bang and I woke up. It was quite loud. I heard a young boy and he was shouting 'dad dad.'

'At first I thought it was someone who had been locked out, left their keys and been locked out and trying to get in. I did get up and look through the blinds and I could still hear the shouting, he was crying and sounded tired. 

'I got up again to have a look at about 2.40am and looked out the window again but I didn't see anything. I thought he had got in the house. I felt awful because I could have phoned the police.'

But another neighbour Sarah Collins was so concerned she phoned the police after believing she could hear a female screaming.

She told the inquest: 'I heard a screaming or shouting noise. I sleep with my bedroom window open so it was quite clear. Originally I thought it was some animals like foxes screeching.

'It carried on and carried on it sounded like a person. Screaming and screeching but also like mumbling noises, it sounded like a couple of people.

'That continued for quite a while and it was about 2am. I got up out of bed went downstairs and made a drink. I got back in bed after about 10 minutes and I could still hear it. 

'At that point I phoned the police. I was concerned that somebody was being attacked - the volume and intensity of the noise and the length of time it was going on.

'It's not unusual to hear noises but unusual to hear noises of that nature.

'It was pretty consistent at that time. I had looked out at the window but couldn't see anything.' She said she stayed up and watched the police arrive around five to 10 minutes later. 

She added: 'I think there were two I think one was in the car. One got out with the torch and I think one was in the car. He didn't really go far. 

'He stayed quite close to the car. I know that he only looked at the land directly behind.' 

The patrolmen left a few minutes later.

The hearing heard  PC Steven Norris, who searched the area in the hours before Leon was found dead, had got out of the patrol car but had no working torch while his colleague PC Andrew Peters, who did have a torch, had only looked in one direction and had wandered into a field. 

'With hindsight we should have extended the search,' said PC Norris. 

'We should have done more. What we did at the time, I thought it was sufficient.'

Ripponden Road, in Oldham, where neighbours reported hearing a young lad calling out 'dad dad' while another had initially assumed that the shouting and screeching noises had been animal

PC Peters added: 'When I think back on my actions I believe that I should have checked to the right as well. 

At one point I heard a noise it sounded like a female, very briefly, but it was quite a distance away. If I believed the noise was coming from anywhere nearby I would have investigated.'

Leon's father told the hearing he had made contact with his son who said that 'he wouldn't be long.' 

He then went to bed and although he was a 'light sleeper' woke up the following morning at at 9am realised that Leon wasn't in his bed and tried calling him on his phone.

He said: 'I spoke to a couple of his friends who he was with the night before to see if he was there, both were surprised that he wasn't home.' 

He told the inquest that he was to see a police cordon close to his home and received a text message from a friend saying that police had found a body. 

He added: 'I said Leon hadn't come home. I just needed to know - my mind was all over the place. I went back up and spoke to the police.'

The hearing at Heywood Coroner's Court, was told Leon was the youngest of four children and that he had grown up to be 'lively and fun' and a popular sportsman, playing both football and rugby and riding BMX bokes.

Tests showed he suffered from hypothermia and would have been more than twice the legal limit for driving. 

Toxicology tests revealed Leon's blood alcohol level was 173 microgrammes of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood. The legal limit for driving is 80mg.

Home Office pathologist Dr Lumb said it was very difficult to determine when Leon had died.

He added:  'One of the main risk factors in this case is alcohol it can cause significant risk of hypothermia developing, judgement could be poor, may not realise that getting cold. 

'Alcohol concentration was high it may have affected judgement hypothermia can develop relatively quickly. The cold can kill within minutes hypothermia causes confusion as well.' 

The inquest continues.
