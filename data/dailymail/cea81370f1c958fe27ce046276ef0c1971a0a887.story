Backing: Angela Merkel addresses the Bundestag today before politicians backed the Greek bailout package

The German parliament today approved the £108billion Greek bailout package despite fierce public opposition.

Chancellor Angela Merkel said it would be irresponsible to abandon the country to bankruptcy.

The Bundestag voted 496 to 90 in favour of the new package - despite 80 per cent of Germans being opposed to the rescue. Five members abstained.

The result of the vote was never in doubt as two opposition parties backed the measures.

The bailout is Greece's second in 
less than two years and Angela Merkel told lawmakers before the vote 
that 'no one can give a 100 per cent guarantee' that the programme would
be a success.

She said: 'The road that lies in front of 
Greece is long and truly not without risk.'

The world’s 20 leading economies, the
G20, at the weekend demanded Germany drop its opposition to a bigger 
European bailout fund, telling Europe it must put up extra money if it 
wanted more help from other countries.

One member of Merkel’s cabinet, 
Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich, has openly called on Greece to 
leave the eur zone, saying its chances of recovery would be greater 
outside. 

'Quite clearly the mood in Germany is turning against further rescues for Greece,' he said yesterday.

'But that’s not surprising. This is 
all deja vu for the public. We’ve been promised all kinds of things that
aren’t fulfilled and then a few months later there’s the need for 
another rescue package. The public’s faith is fading fast.'

Hours before today's crunch vote Germany's biggest newspaper urged politicians to reject the proposals.

Bild, the German tabloid, ran with 
the frontpage headline 'Stop!' after a weekend poll showed the public 
firmly opposed the bailout.

Germany is desperate to keep the euro project alive at all costs - but the public are opposed to the size of the rescue package.

While Chancellor Angela Merkel speaks
of the need for solidarity with Athens, Bild has become the voice of a 
long suffering people bitter and frustrated at their taxes underwriting 
Greece.

The paper said today: 'Enough is enough.

'Bild appeals to all MPs – don’t go down this crazy path any longer.'

The paper went on to print the opinions of ten leading economic experts who agree with them.

One of them, Professor Gert Wagner, of 
the German Institute for Economic Research, said: 'This latest aid 
package solves nothing and will only serve to increase Greek misery.

'The exit of Greece from the eurozone should no longer be a taboo subject.'

Now it longer seems it is. Hans-Peter Friedrich, the government interior minster, also questioned the value of Greece remaining a euro partner – to the anger of Mrs Merkel.

He said that Greece should be allowed
to leave - the first time a member of the German government has openly 
called for such a radical step.

'Greece's
chances to regenerate itself and become competitive are surely greater 
outside the monetary union than if it remains in the euro area,' 
Friedrich told news magazine Der Spiegel.

'I'm not talking about throwing Greece out, but rather about creating incentives for an exit that they can't pass up.'

Norbert
Barthle, the ruling CDU's budgetary policy spokesman in the Bundestag, 
also expressed skepticism about whether the expectations reflected in 
the rescue package are realistic, even though he supports the deal in 
general.

'I have some 
doubts about whether the package's stated goal of reducing Greece's debt
to 120.5 percent of gross domestic product by the year 2020 can be 
achieved,' he said.

Nein! Germany's biggest newspaper Bild urged politicians to vote against a second bailout for Greece

Meanwhile uncertainty over Greece's position within the Euro has continued to stifle market expectations.

Germany's Dax and France's CAC 40 were both down more than 1 per cent following falls on Asian markets overnight.

Simon Denham of Capital Spreads said the G20 meeting over the weekend had disappointed investors.

'The non-European members of the G20 said to the European members in no uncertain terms, put up or shut up.

'We still have the political stalemate in Europe whereby Germany’s current leader will not get its bazooka out for fear of giving up further political ground to her opponents when she is already reliant on a coalition to pass votes on European bailouts.

'By giving in and saying that Germany will stump up could easily cost Merkel the next German election in the autumn of next year.

'But other nations around the world will simply not inject any more funds into the IMF in order to prop up the eurozone when large parts of the region remain woefully uncompetitive and profligate.'
