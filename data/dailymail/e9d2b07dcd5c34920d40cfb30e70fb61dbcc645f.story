He was 'ridiculed' by his friends when he started a business  that lovingly restored a car that was derided by motorists across Europe.

But now Tony Shields has definitely had the last laugh. 

His Bradford-based company, which revamps old Citroen 2CVs - once the butt of jokes in the motor industry - is now proving so popular it is struggling to keep up with demand.

Mr Shields, of Brighouse, West Yorkshire, said in a recent order that 30 of the car's chassis had been sent to its home country, France, in one shipment alone.  

The 2CV City company relocated from Sowerby Bridge in West Yorkshire to a new workshop in Low Moor, Bradford, and business is booming. 

At its new home, it turns old wrecks back into new cars and also develops new chassis.  

It sells the iconic French-made cars for up to £12,000. The company also rebuilds the Citroen H Van.

Mr Shields employs seven staff and even drives trailer loads of the chassis to customers in France himself.

The 2CV City company, in Bradford, has seen turnover go up by about 40 per cent in the last three to four years

Citreon 2CVs are one of the world's quirkiest cars, sometimes referred to as the 'upside down umbrella'

He said: 'Over the last three or four years turnover has gone up by about 40 per cent.

'We make the chassis because they have a tendency to rust and we usually sell about 200 a year with a large number of them going to France.

'They still make the original style chassis over there but ours are almost half the price.

'A lot of people are reliving their youth and they are looking at classic cars and thinking "let's go back to what we had years ago".

'The beauty of the 2CV is that it's very simplistic with no electronics and people can do all the maintenance themselves.'

There are seven staff (including the one pictured) that work on revamping the 2CV cars 

Over its 42-year production run, the car was a great commercial success - around 5million units were sold

Citreon 2CVs are one of the world's quirkiest cars, sometimes referred to as the 'upside down umbrella'.

Conceived before the war, to carry a farmer's eggs across a rough field, nearly 5 million of the 'ugly ducks' were sold.

The last of the quirky little French cars left British showrooms in 1990 costing £4,552 on the road.

It has since become a French icon - and for that it has a certain company in Yorkshire to thank. 

The prototype for the Citroen 2CV - 'an umbrella on four wheels' - dates back to the 1930s' design by engineer Pierre-Jules Boulanger.

Officially unveiled at the Paris Motor Show in 1948, the name is an abbreviation of 'deux chevaux vapeur' - which translates as 'two steam horses'.

Regarded as a simple, reliable vehicle, the economy car was produced by the French manufacturer up until 1990.

It was famously heralded as being able to be driven across a ploughed field without breaking the eggs it was carrying.

Over its 42-year production run, the car was a great commercial success - around 5million units were sold, including just over a million vans.

In 1981, a yellow 2CV was driven by James Bond in the film For Your Eyes Only, including a chase sequence through a Spanish olive farm.

From 1988 onwards, production took place in Portugal rather than France. This continued for two years until 2CV production halted.
