Tragic: Luke Griffin, 20, drowned after falling over a 100ft cliff following a night out in Newquay, Cornwall in June 2012

An amateur footballer on a night out with team mates drowned on a Cornish beach after falling over a 100ft cliff following a drink and drugs binge.

Luke Griffin, 20, was discovered on the sand in Newquay while on an end-of-season tour with 19 friends in the notorious party town in June last year.

The builder had been involved in a scuffle with two men in a car park before he stumbled over a wall and on to the Great Western beach.

At an inquest into his death in Truro, Cornwall, coroner Andrew Cox ruled that Luke 'drowned while under the influence of alcohol and cocaine following a recent head injury’.

Recording an accidental death verdict, Mr Cox urged youngsters visiting the town to act responsible while having fun.

He said: 'Luke isn’t the first young man who has died in Newquay falling over cliffs after consuming too much alcohol or drugs.

'I don’t want to have any more distressed family and friends appearing before me, mourning the loss of a youngster.

'This wont change unless the culture of drinking to excess also changes. Come to Newquay, have a good time but drink responsibly and get home safely.'

The inquest heard that Luke had downed several cans of lager and snorted cocaine while on a minibus taking the group from Gloucester to Cornwall.

He had become separated from his friends 
during the night out and become embroiled in a fight with two men in a 
car park, when his head was stamped on in the brawl.

Police were called but Luke refused 
medical help and walked off towards the direction of his surf lodge 
accommodation, which is when he fell over the cliff.

Experts
said he was still alive when he hit the beach but was soon drowned by 
the incoming tide. His body was found by a dog walker the next morning.

It is unclear whether his injuries, which included a broken nose, where sustained in the fall or the fight.

Two men were arrested on suspicion of assault but were later released without charge.

Paying tribute to the tragic 20 year old, his grandmother Angela Earwaker, 63, said: 'He was a loveable rogue, kind, caring and compassionate. He had just got player of the year. We collected his trophy after he passed away.

'They just loved his smile - that’s how we want to remember him.'

His death is just one of many tragedies which have blighted the coastal town, which famously attracts gangs of youngsters in the summer months, as well as hen and stag parties.

In the summer of 2009 Andrew Curwell, 19, and Paddy Higgins, 16, fell to their deaths from cliffs in separate incidents whilst celebrating the end of their exams.

The deaths led to the introduction of a security plan for the resort, including the confiscation of alcohol carried by under-age drinkers and police patrols on trains.

In January, 26-year-old medic Oliver Doy was found on Newquay beach six days after he vanished during a night out in the town.
