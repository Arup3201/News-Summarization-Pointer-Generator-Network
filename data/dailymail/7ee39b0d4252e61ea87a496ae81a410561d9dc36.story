Wonga will not be prosecuted despite sending bullying letters from fake law firms to threaten 45,000 customers who were behind on repayments, police said today.

The payday lender was ordered last year to pay more than £2.6million in compensation to people who received the bogus demands.

But City of London Police said today that, after a 'thorough review', it has concluded 'there is not sufficient evidence to progress a criminal investigation'.

Consumer groups and politicians believed there was clear evidence of a criminal deception and insist the police should have pursued them through the courts.

Shadow consumer affairs minister Stella Creasy said she was 'very surprised' at the decision while the Law Society, which represents around 160,000 solicitors across England and Wales, had demanded the police investigation.

Ms Creasy said: 'The Financial Conduct Authority seems to have enough evidence to make Wonga pay compensation to customers for scaring them like this - why don't the police?'

The MP believes it is an offence to pretend to be a lawyer under the 1974 Solicitors Act while it could also be and act of fraud.

While the company presents itself as the ethical face of the payday loans industry with its friendly TV ad puppets, an investigation by the Financial Conduct Authority last year found extensive evidence of 'thuggish' behaviour.

Among Wonga's victims threatened by the fake legal team was a woman who missed repayments because she was in hospital recovering from a miscarriage.

The FCA said Wonga sent letters to customers in arrears from what appeared to be two law firms, called 'Chainey, D'Amato & Shannon' and 'Barker and Lowe Legal Recoveries' – but these two companies were invented by Wonga to put pressure on customers.

In some cases extra charges were added to the outstanding debt to cover the cost of sending these threatening letters. 

Last June, Wonga agreed with the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to pay £2.6 million in compensation for the letters it sent to 45,000 consumers from non-existent law firms.

But thousands of people who are in line for a payout are yet to receive their compensation offer from Wonga.

Around three-quarters of the 45,000 people impacted have received their compensation offers so far, and the company expects that the remaining quarter will have received their offers by April this year.

A Wonga spokesman said: 'Our focus remains on putting things right for customers affected by this historic issue.'

Wonga is Britain's biggest payday lender, with more than one million active customers.

After the compensation announcement was made last summer, the City of London Police confirmed that it would reassess whether Wonga should be subject to a criminal investigation.

Police had discussed the case a year earlier but it was decided that the matter should be left to regulators so that compensation payouts would not be delayed.

The statement issued by the police today said: 'The central allegations were that Wonga had deceived its customers by sending letters falsely purporting to be from lawyers with the aim of recovering outstanding debts from customers.

'After a thorough review of all the material gathered, the City of London Police has concluded there is not sufficient evidence to progress a criminal investigation.'

The case, which was described by consumer campaigners as a 'shocking new low' for the payday industry, saw Wonga add charges to some customers' accounts to cover administration fees for sending the letters.

Further legal action was threatened if the debt was not repaid. These firms did not exist and Wonga was using this tactic to pile the pressure on customers to pay up, the FCA said.

The FCA could not impose a fine on Wonga for what it described as 'unfair and misleading' debt collection practices, which happened between October 2008 and November 2010, because the failings were uncovered by a previous regulatory regime and it does not have powers to issue retrospective penalties.

Wonga has previously apologised 'unreservedly' and has said all 45,000 customers who received correspondence from the fake law firms would be pro-actively contacted and offered a flat rate of £50 for distress and inconvenience and admin fees charged for the fake letters would also be refunded. Additional compensation payments may also be made, depending on individual circumstances.

Scandal: The money lender, founded by Errol Damelin, has still not paid all its compensation

Appearing before the Treasury Committee last November, Wonga's chief credit officer Nick Brookes set out the difficulties Wonga had had in trying to contact customers due for compensation, saying: 'We've had to go back a substantial way in terms of firstly the identification of those customers and then the contact with those customers.'

Wonga has previously said that the 'few' people who were directly involved with sending the letters are no longer in the business. 

Law Society chief executive Desmond Hudson said last year: 'It seems that the intention behind Wonga's dishonest activity was to make customers believe that their outstanding debt had been passed to a genuine law firm.'

Wonga has undergone significant changes as a company in recent months and has said that it expects to be smaller and less profitable in the near term.

Last July it brought in the former chief executive of the RSA insurance group, Andy Haste, to head the group, replacing founder Errol Damelin who had left earlier in the year.

Wonga has recently tightened up its lending procedures, as well as removing its adverts featuring elderly puppet characters from British TV screens.

The payday lending industry generally has been subject to a huge clampdown after coming under the FCA's regulation last April.

Firms have only been granted interim permission to operate under the FCA's toughened regime and they will have to apply for full permission to continue operating. Wonga is due to apply for full authorisation later in the year.

Payday lenders are now no longer allowed to roll over a loan more than twice and and they can make only two unsuccessful attempts to claw money back out of a borrower's account.

Last month, the rules across the industry were tightened further, with a cap being placed on the overall cost of a payday loan as part of moves to stop such debts spiralling out of control.
