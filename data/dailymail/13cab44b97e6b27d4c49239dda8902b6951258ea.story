Savers could soon be able to switch current accounts within five days instead of seven.

Last year ministers cut the time limit from 30 days to a week. More than 1.2million people, frustrated with rock-bottom interest rates, switched banks as a result.

Now the Chancellor may reduce the time limit to five days in his Autumn Statement next Wednesday, according to Sky News.

Chancellor George Osborne, pictured, is believed to be considering reducing the length of time it takes to swap a bank account from seven days to just five in a bid to encourage competition for savers 

The Treasury could also extend its ‘switching guarantee’ to small businesses with a turnover of up to £6.5million. The guarantee is currently restricted to firms taking less than £2million.

A lower time limit is aimed at increasing competition between banks and building societies, in the hope that they will increase interest rates to attract customers.

Rates on instant-access current accounts have been at a record low since July, and show no signs of improving. The average is now just 0.42 per cent, below the Bank of England’s base rate of 0.5 per cent.

One of the biggest beneficiaries of seven-day switching has been Nationwide. However, last night its chief executive Graham Beale said: ‘My personal view is [reducing the time limit] will not make much difference. I don’t think customers will be any more likely to switch if it takes five days than if it takes seven.’

During the first three months of the year, 22,771 savers switched to Nationwide and 11,091 left, for a ‘net gain’ of 11,680. Only Halifax and Santander did better, with Barclays, RBS, HSBC and Lloyds all haemorrhaging customers.

The Treasury and the Payments Council, which oversees the switching guarantee service, declined to comment on claims that Mr Osborne would make five days the new limit.

Graham Beale of Nationwide, pictured, said cutting two days off the time it takes to change bank accounts  will not make any difference among savers. Last year the time was slashed from 30 days to seven 

However, it is understood that the mooted changes have met with resistance from several banks, which say there is little evidence to suggest a lower limit would lead more customers to switch.

Anna Bowes, of advice website Savings Champion, said the publicity surrounding the switching service ‘seems to have had a positive effect on the competition between key providers’. However, she agreed that ‘reducing the time taken from seven to five days seems rather pointless’.

The Financial Conduct Authority is already reviewing the current switching service, and will examine whether banks could let customers keep their account number when they move. It is expected to report back next year.

Low interest rates for savers have been blamed on the Bank of England’s base rate – which has stood at 0.5 per cent for six years – and the Government’s Funding for Lending Scheme.

Under FLS, the Government allowed banks and building societies to borrow £80billion at cheap rates if they helped homebuyers and businesses.

Launched in 2012, the policy was designed to reinvigorate the economy after the financial crisis – but savings rates collapsed, as banks no longer needed new current account customers to fund loans.
