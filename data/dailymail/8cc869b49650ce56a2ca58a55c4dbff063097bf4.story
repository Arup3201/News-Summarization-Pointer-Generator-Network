Appeal: Ahmed Faraz's appeal against his conviction for publishing and distributing extremist texts to terrorists was upheld

A bookseller who was jailed for publishing and distributing extremist texts to terrorists has had his conviction quashed.

Birmingham-raised Ahmed Faraz, 33 - who counted high-profile terrorists including July 7 bomb plot leader Mohammed Sidique Khan among his customers - was convicted of 11 counts of possessing and disseminating terrorist publications in 2011.

Court of Appeal judges have now ruled the prosecution should not have been allowed to rely on the presence of the books in terrorists' homes, when there was no suggestion the texts had actually encouraged them to carry out acts of extremism.

Father-of-five Faraz, who operated 
out of the Maktabah Islamic bookshop in Birmingham, had been sentenced 
to three years in prison for publishing radical texts and violent DVDs 
and distributing them globally in an effort to 'prime people for 
terrorism'.

At the
 time of Faraz's conviction in 2011 Mr Justice Calvert Smith said many 
Maktabah publications had found their way onto the bookshelves of 
terrorists.

Members
 of the gang behind the foiled trans-Atlantic airline plot cited Faraz's
 texts in their suicide videos, a report in the Daily Telegraph said.

Having
 worked for car manufacturer Rover, the stock broker Charles Schwab and 
British Gas, Faraz had became involved with Maktabah as a 23-year-old, 
editing texts and producing DVDs.

While
 working at the shop in Sparkhill he wrote a foreward to Milestones, by 
Sayyid Qutb, whose works are known to have influenced al-Qaeda.

Faraz, who has a degree in Islamic theology from the University of Birmingham,
 also circulated books written by Abdullah Azzam, a highly influential 
scholar who preached jihad and mentored Osama bin Laden.

In
 the past the 33-year-old has spoken in defence of Maktabah, which he 
insisted was not an extremist bookshop, but a shop which aimed to 
present Islam 'as a whole'.

His appeal was upheld last month, but was not previously reported.

The Crown Prosecution Service confirmed yesterday that it would not seek a retrial, according to a report in the Times.
