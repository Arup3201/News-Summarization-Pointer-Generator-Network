A mother tragically died of a complication during childbirth after opting for a caesarian section that saved her newborn but cost her own life.

As Karisa Bugal, 34, a mother of two, went into labour doctors discovered she was suffering a rare and dangerous condition called amniotic fluid embolism.

Her unborn son's heart rate began to dip, meaning his life was at risk, prompting Mrs Bugal to elect to have a caesarian - the fastest option for his delivery.

Tragic: Karisa Bugal chose to have a caesarian section to save the life of her unborn son, but in so doing sacrificed her own life. She had just enough strength to ask how much he weighed before she passed

While a delay could have saved her life, it would have cost him his. She passed away shortly after he was born, with just enough strength to ask how much he weighed as she was wheeled to intensive care. 

Declan Jay Bugal was born weighing a healthy 7lb 4oz. It was a day before his mother's eighth wedding anniversary.

Amniotic fluid embolism is a rare and not well understood obstetric emergency where amniotic fluid, of hair, cells or other debris from the foetus gets into the mother's bloodstream and triggers an allergic reaction.

Affecting between one and 12 in every 100,000 mothers during delivery, it leads to organ failure, heart and lung collapse and profuse bleeding that will not clot.

Dr Kelly Gerow of the Medical Center of Aurora told KUSA: 'We don't know how to prevent it. We don't know how to keep it from happening at all.'

It was Dr Gerow who explained to Mrs Bugal the grim prognosis she faced during labour.

'Her other option would have been to stay awake for her surgery, but by the time we would have put in a spinal tap or something it's possible Declan would not have made it,' the doctor said.

A GoFundMe page has so far raised nearly $40,000 for the Bugals. It describes the moment Mrs Bugal, survived by her son, her toddler daughter Mallory and her husband Wes, made her choice.

'The medical staff informed Karisa of the Embolism and the immediate danger it would pose,' it says.

'She chose to have them perform an emergency C-section so Declan could be born sacrificing her own body and ultimately her life to save his.

'Karisa was concious of Declan being born just before the Doctors were forced to take her to the ICU. She simply asked "How big is he?"'

Mr Bugal told KUSA he now faces the challenge of bringing up a newborn and toddler alone.

'How do I explain to him that his mom is gone giving birth to him? I think about that all the time,' he said. 'How do I explain when he asks where's mommy?'
