Your every movement can be tracked using signals from your mobile phone.

And with revelations that authorities can remotely enable the microphones on Android phones, mobile privacy has become big business.

It’s even inspiring the fashion industry, with a new clothing range recently launched to help keep people under the radar.

Your every movement can be tracked using signals from your mobile. Now a new range of clothing could make sure hackers and spies are unable to get access to sensitive data from electronic banks cards and mobiles

The London-based company, The Affair, claims its clothing helps anyone go unnoticed by blocking signals that allow spies and hackers to access sensitive data.

The clothes combine the colours and workwear styling of George Orwell's novel 1984 with stealth, removable pockets made from police-grade shielding fabrics.

Named the UnPocket, the metal-covered fibres on the fabric are capable of blocking mobile, Wi-Fi, GPS and RFID signals to ~100 dB (13.56 MHz – 2.4 GHz) within seconds.

'When closed the UnPocket creates a Faraday cage that blocks all radio signals in and out,' Zoltan Csaki,co-found of The Affair told MailOnline. 

'It’s the same technology the police use to prevent suspects from remotely wiping digital evidence.

The clothing range was inspired by Edward Snowden and George Orwell’s book 1984 (pictured)

'But it also works in reverse to protect you from location tracking by making it impossible for your phone to connect to the surveillance grid (cell, WiFi, GPS).'

Mr Csaki added that simply turning your phone off isn’t enough as without physically removing the battery there’s no guarantee that your phone isn’t leaking data. 

It measures 4.25 x 6.25 inches (11 x 16 cm). It can also be used to hold passports and contactless banks cards, making them secure against wireless identity theft.

The London-based company was set up by two former advertising executives who are now hoping to raise £25,000 ($40,200) by the end of this month to help commercialise the product

‘Edward Snowden proved that Big Brother is no longer fiction,’ the company wrote on its Kickstarter campaign.

‘The government is watching everyone via our smart phones: telescreens beyond George Orwell’s wildest dreams. It’s time to fight back.’

‘When news of Snowden and the NSA broke last year we couldn’t sit idle whilst our basic human rights were eroded,’ said Co-Founder Zoltan Csaki.

One UnPocket (pictured) is included with each piece of the collection and UnPocket is also sold separately

‘The result is our “1984” collection with embedded UnPocket stealth fabric technology which allows you to quickly and easily ‘go dark’ and drop off the surveillance grid.

‘It’s fashion inspired by Orwell’s fiction and built for the post-Snowden reality.’

The UnPockets are £18 ($29), the shirts and chinos are £59 ($95) each; the blazer is £72 ($115) and the jacket is £78 ($125).

One UnPocket is included with each piece of the collection and UnPocket is also sold separately as a standalone item.

If the company raises enough funds, it is hoping to ship the items in February next year. 

'There’s the over-sharing subset of the population who desire fame and like all celebraties have no claim to privacy,' said Mr Csaki.

'They won’t be interested in our ‘1984’ collection. But for the great majority of people privacy does matter.

'Because as Snowden said “Privacy is what allows us to determine who we are and who we want to be”'.

There are countless ways people can spy on you nowadays - from hidden microphones to Google Glass, drones and security cameras.

If this makes you feel paranoid, a firm has created a router that detects such surveillance devices and blocks them from accessing your Wi-Fi network.

Owners of the Cyborg Unplug, can also disconnect all target devices from any network they are associated with, including paired connections with phones.

Every wireless device has a unique hardware signature assigned to it by the manufacturer, These signatures are broadcast by wireless devices as they probe for, connect to and use wireless networks.

Cyborg Unplug 'sniffs' the air for these signatures, looking for devices its owner has selected to ban. If a banned device is discovered an alarm is triggered.

If that device is found to be connected to a network that Cyborg Unplug is trained to guard, a stream of special 'de-authentication' signals (packets) are sent to disconnect it.
