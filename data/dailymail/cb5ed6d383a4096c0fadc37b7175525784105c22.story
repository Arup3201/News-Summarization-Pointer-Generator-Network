The RFU has banned two men from Twickenham for two months for the alleged homophobic abuse aimed towards Welsh referee Nigel Owens during England's defeat to New Zealand earlier this month.

Both men will also pay £1,000 each to a charity of Owens' choosing following an initial RFU investigation.

However, there is a second ongoing investigation into the alleged incident - which took place during the November international at Twickenham on November 8 and came to light in a letter from a spectator published in The Guardian.

'As a lifelong rugby fan, a straight man in his 60s, I could not believe that a bunch of men half my age watching a rugby match in the 21st century could be capable of hurling such nasty, foul-mouthed, racist, homophobic abuse at an openly gay match official,' Keith Wilson, from South Yorkshire, wrote in a letter to The Guardian on Wednesday.

'My equally disgusted son is in his 30s but next to him, hearing this vitriol, was a little boy.

'I felt ashamed.'

And Owens, speaking on BBC Radio 5 Live, says it's others the abusers are hurting, not himself. 

'They go to the stadiums, get drunk and think its fine to shout abuse,' Owens said.

'It's up to rugby people in the stadium saying 'that's not acceptable in this sport' so we can get rid of them from the game.'

'I'd tell them to think twice about saying things, because it's not me they're hurting, it's the young kid sitting in the row in front who's maybe dealing with their own sexuality.

'The most difficult thing I ever had to do in my life was accepting I was gay. It's someone sitting two seats away, going through what I went through, dealing with who they are, who are the people they're putting in danger. 

The Welsh official is widely considered to be one of the world's best referees

'I've been there myself and I know they can tip you over the edge, I had a second chance, let's make sure that we don't put other people in that situation - because there's no need for it in society and no need for it in life.

'People say that I've broken down barriers by being a gay man in sport, but the true heroes here are the ones who don't stand by, who stand up and bring it to the attention of the governing bodies.'

Owens is one of only a handful of homosexual people in rugby and admitted he contemplated suicide before he came out.

He is also an extremely highly-respected referee and is regarded as one of world's finest officials.  

Two men have been banned from Twickenham for two years for the alleged homophobic abuse 

In a statement on Friday, RFU chief executive Ian Ritchie said: 'While instances of this nature are exceptionally rare, the RFU takes rugby's values of teamwork, respect, enjoyment, discipline and sportsmanship very seriously, and is determined to uphold them.

'We are all guardians of these aspects of the game, on and off the pitch, and it is these values which make the sport special.'

In addition, the RFU has insisted it will endeavour to underline exactly what is expected from supporters at Twickenham - with messaging being inserted into every ticket pack, programme, on LED boards and big screens throughout the ground highlighting the behaviour expected. 

A fan sparked the RFU probe by claiming he was 'ashamed' at the abuse aimed at Owens
