Danny Welbeck is a major injury doubt ahead of England’s opening group game against Italy after limping out of training on Tuesday.

Welbeck pulled up midway through the 90 minute session based on team shape ahead of Saturday’s clash with Cesare Prandelli’s side.

The England winger, who is a firm selection favourite with England head coach Roy Hodgson, appears to have a hamstring strain.

He left the training ground with blue tape on the inside of his thigh after undergoing treatment with England head physio Gary Lewin.

Hodgson also revealed that the players have started practising penalties and they were taken without a keeper during yesterday’s session.

England’s players were asked to nominate a spot in the goal and had to shoot through hoops as part of the drill which is believed to have involved every squad member.

Welbeck’s chances of starting against Italy in Manaus appear to rest on whether the Manchester United forward can train fully in the next two days.

Hodgson worked on England’s attacking play during the session and trialled Raheem Sterling in the No10 role behind Daniel Sturridge for much of it.

The Liverpool flyer also played right and left as Hodgson tinkered with his team shape in training.  Adam Lallana and now James Milner are also in the hunt to play alongside Wayne Rooney and Sturridge in an attacking England formation.

Hodgson is clearly tempted to start Sterling against Italy on Saturday and insists it wouldn’t be a risk to play him.

He has played just 39 minutes of football in the last five weeks and was sent off during England’s friendly with Ecuador during the team’s stopover in Miami.

Hodgson added: ‘He’s as fit as a flea and I’m pretty certain that he hasn’t forgotten how to play matches either. 

‘It was unfortunate that he couldn’t play the game, but I can tell you that Raheem Sterling is very much in the group of players I’m considering. 

‘If I select him, it won’t be in my opinion a risk that he hasn’t played so many minutes. 

‘And if I don’t select him, it certainly won’t be because he has only played 39 minutes.

‘It will be because I prefer someone else. That’s all I can tell you.’

Hodgson also revealed that Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain is making progress and should be fit for England’s second group game against Uruguay on June 19 in Sao Paolo.

Yesterday the England forward trained without a knee brace but is not yet able to take part in contact practice matches.

Hodgson added: ‘It looks very unlikely that we’ll replace him. I don’t think that will be the case. I’m not a doctor I can’t give you real up to date or detailed information about where it is. 

‘He has got a strained (right) medial ligament, that we do know. But he is certainly working very hard and I don’t think he could be further forward in terms of his progression than he is now. He’s well up there.’

England’s players and staff have also started taking a course of anti-malaria tablets as they prepare to fly to Manaus on Thursday.

Hodgson, who decided not take the tablets when he flew to the jungle region in December, said: ‘As far as I’m concerned, I’ve got to go with medical opinion. 

‘If the doctors are telling me that when we go to Manaus, the players must take malaria tablets, whether it has side-effects or not, what do I do? 

‘I can’t turn around and say “We will not take malaria tablets”, because the bottom line is better stomach cramps or whatever it is for one player in ten than have someone contract malaria because that would be unthinkable.’
