Dundee United star Paul Paton has launched an astonishing attack on Celtic as he accused the Parkhead club of having a long history of ‘manipulating’ people and situations for their own benefit.

The frustrated Tannadice star claimed there have been ‘continual injustices’ across the three games between United and Celtic this month that have yielded six red cards - four for Jackie McNamara’s team.

In the wake of the stormy 1-1 Scottish Cup draw at Tannadice, Celtic manager Ronny Deila and his captain Scott Brown both accused United kid Aidan Connolly of ‘diving’ to win his side a penalty.

Despite Deila calling on the SFA to take action, none was forthcoming but United were subsequently denied a penalty when Brown barged Ryan Dow in the League Cup Final, won 2-0 by Celtic at Hampden last Sunday.

And after the 4-0 Scottish Cup replay win at Parkhead on Wednesday, Deila accused Ryan McGowan of endangering the career of Liam Henderson with a wild lunge.

But the United camp felt the reaction of Celtic’s players may have influenced Calum Murray’s decision to send the Australian off.

And ahead of the fourth and final match between United and Celtic at Parkhead in the Premiership on Saturday, Paton appeared to accuse Celtic of heaping pressure on match officials.

‘Ronny Deila has an opinion on everything but I don’t really read too much into what he has to say or who he puts pressure on,’ said Paton.

‘But I think Celtic as a club can manipulate people more than Dundee United can. That kind of thing has been happening for years.

‘We have seen injustices in the last few games we have played and that causes frustration. It feels that we do not get any decisions and that it is continual.

‘I saw things differently (to Deila). I don’t think Ryan McGowan deserved to get sent off as he clearly won the ball. I don’t know if I am being biased but it is a hard tackle but he clearly won the ball.

‘I don’t think there was much in it (but) they have made a lot of it. It looked like a good tackle to me but that is only my opinion.’

Paton’s sense of injustice was also stoked by the failure of referee Murray to hand a second yellow to Efe Ambrose for a foul on Nadir Ciftci at 1-0.

He continued: ‘I thought he was lucky to stay on the park but we have seen it in the last few meetings that we don’t seem to get things like that going for us against Celtic.

‘How he stayed on the park I will never know. It was a clear yellow card. But when you come to places like (Parkhead) you never seem to get these decisions.

‘I don’t know if it is just coincidence but you saw last weekend in the League Cup Final we should have had a clear penalty.

‘Then Efe Ambrose should have got sent off when we were on top in the game and it did not happen. Small things like that change games.’

Paton also defended himself after Celtic’s Anthony Stokes yesterday accused the United midfielder of catching him with a ‘sly elbow’.

Stokes was sent off for retaliation but later said on Twitter: ‘I get a sly elbow in the face by someone that has nothing about them and get sent off, typical!’

But Paton pleaded his innocence, saying: ‘I have ran across him and I don’t know if he thinks I have meant to hit him but he has lashed out and caught me on the side of the face.

‘I stepped across him and I don’t know if I have caught him with my leg or my arm. I honestly don’t know but it was certainly not intentional.

‘But there’s no edge between the two teams. It’s been taken out of context as there were not really any bad challenges in the game. We come back to Parkhead on Saturday in the league with a clean slate.’
