Anne Hathaway decided last-minute to wear Prada to the Oscars, snubbing her long-time favorite designer and good friend, Valentino.

'I didn't know what I was wearing until about three hours ago,' the Best Supporting Actress-winner told Ryan Seacrest on E!'s Live From the Red Carpet. 'This was the one that spoke to me in the end.'

Her dress choice undoubtedly came as a surprise to Valentino Garavani, whose fashion house sent out a press release just before the awards show stating that it would be dressing Anne Hathaway, Sally Field and Jennifer Aniston.

Given the cold shoulder: Anne Hathaway decided last-minute to wear Prada to the Oscars, despite being expected to wear a custom-made gown by her long-time favorite designer and friend, Valentino

According to Fashionista, the actress's impulse decision was prompted when she saw Amanda Seyfried's Alexander McQueen lace gown, which was apparently very similar to the Valentino number she was slated to wear.

Wanting to stand out from her Les Miserables co-star, Ms Hathaway reportedly 'freaked out,' 
requiring her stylist Rachel Zoe to call in several different dresses 
just before the show.

Whatever the reason for her outfit choice, the 30-year-old certainly caused a stir in her backless pink satin Prada gown - complete with a very perky bust line - which she accented with a sparkling Tiffany necklace.

Ms Hathaway has a long history of 
working and being friends with 80-year-old Valentino Garavani, who has said of the actress: 'She's a very good friend of mine. She's like my daughter.'

She has worn a number of his 
creations to awards shows - including the bold red strapless number she 
wore to host the Oscars in 2011.

And the designer, with whom she spent last New Year's Eve in Switzerland, even custom-made the bridal gown she wore for her wedding to Adam Shulman last year.
