Hollywood royalty Michael Douglas delivered a congratulatory message to victorious Swansea City from the Oscars last night - as the secret motivation behind yesterday's stunning Wembley triumph emerged.

Douglas, who is married to Swansea-born actress Catherine Zeta-Jones, was clearly enjoying himself and revelling in the Swans' famous win. He said: 'Swansea won. Very happy about that.'

The City of Swansea today unveiled plans for a parade tomorrow to showcase the club's first major trophy, which was won after first-team coach Alan Curtis showed the squad an inspirational video.

The parade will start at 4.30pm outside 
the Dragon Hotel, before weaving its way through the city to a civic 
reception at the Guildhall.Â 

Defeated fourth-tier Bradford, however, have asked their city council to put their plans for a parade on hold until the end of the season.

Curtis revealed how a video montage of great moments from the club's 101-year 
history helped inspire the Welsh side to their 5-0 thumping of Bradford, thanks to goals from man of the match Nathan Dyer (two), Jonathan de Guzman (two) and 
Michu.

Curtis, 58, is better placed than most 
to judge the significance of the club's first major honour, having 
scored 96 goals in 364 league appearances for the Swans during three 
spells at the club as a player.

The former striker is now part of 
Michael Laudrup's backroom staff, and helped put together a short video 
of key figures from Swansea's past, which the squad watched on the 
morning of the final.

Curtis said: 'I felt it was important we 
showed the players it was not just about the cup final, but about a club
 with a century of history behind it.

'We wanted them to be aware of the great players and the great teams who have pulled on the white shirt before them.

'There was footage of players like (record scorer) Ivor Allchurch, Robbie James and James Thomas and other people like that.

'We also included footage of key moments
 in our cup run this season, we just wanted to give them a feel for the 
history of the club and what they could achieve.'

Curtis played for the Swans during their
 previous spell in the top flight back in the early 1980s under the 
guidance of John Toshack, but then had to watch the club slide 
perilously close to the precipice on and off the field.

But, under the guidance of chairman Huw 
Jenkins, the club have been on a constant upward trajectory over the 
last decade, and Curtis believes success at Wembley even tops the 
achievement of becoming a Premier League club.

'This is the club's greatest achievement without a doubt,' he said. 'To get to the Premier League has given 
us a platform. But when you consider we had never won a major trophy, it
 is by some distance the best thing the club has done.

'It is fantastic. All credit to Bradford
 for what they have done but this was vitally important for us and to do
 it in the club's centenary season as well is just incredible.'

Announcing details of the League Cup winners' parade, Lord Mayor of Swansea, Councillor Dennis James, said: 'This is a fantastic moment for the Swans and for Swansea as a whole.

'After their promotion to the Premier 
League, Sunday's events open a new chapter in a remarkable success story
 for our city's football team.

'I'm sure thousands of fans will want to line the route and be part of an event that will be remembered for years to come.'

The parade will start at 4.30pm outside 
the Dragon Hotel, before weaving its way through the city to a civic 
reception at the Guildhall.

Rolling road closures will be in place so that routes can be reopened as soon as the parade passes through.

Leader of Swansea Council, Councillor 
David Phillips, said: 'This is an exciting achievement and we have 
pulled out all the stops to get the victory parade organised as quickly 
as possible and we're sure it's going to be a tremendous success.

'We hope everyone who comes along has a 
great time, but the safety of the participants and the public is 
paramount. For this reason, we would ask all spectators to stay behind 
the safety barriers and follow any instructions that they may get from 
the safety stewards.'

Bradford, meanwhile, have asked the 
city council to put celebrations marking their historic Capital One Cup 
run on hold until the end of the season.

Bradford Lord Mayor Dale Smith said the city will expect nothing less than an open-top bus parade and civic reception.

But the Bantams must now quickly focus all their attentions on Wednesday's League Two game against Dagenham at Valley Parade in a bid to keep their promotion hopes alive.

'Any celebration is on hold at the moment at the club's request until they've got the next challenge out of the way," Councillor Smith told Press Association Sport.

'They've got two very important league matches coming up this week and we think we're going to hold it, with the club's agreement, at the end of the season so that Phil and his side can concentrate on the league.

'There are plans afoot. The city will expect a celebration certainly. What the club have achieved throughout the season has been nothing short of sensational and the council will extend a full civic celebration.

'They have had some amazing results in the Capital One Cup and while the fans were disappointed at the outcome, Swansea are clearly a very talented Premier League side and played better than us on the day.

'But the spirit of Bradford's fans was a real feature. The bigger the challenge became, the more they cheered and waved their flags.

'I was proud to be among them. It was wonderful. I would expect an open-top bus parade would be a fitting way to mark their incredible achievements. We're just waiting for the season to end, hopefully on a high, and for the sunshine to come and we'll start waving those flags again.'

Bradford became the first club from the fourth tier to reach a major final at Wembley following wins over Premier League sides Wigan, Arsenal and Aston Villa.
