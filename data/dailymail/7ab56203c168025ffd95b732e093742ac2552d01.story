A woman who swindled £50,000 in benefits by claiming she was a single mother was caught after she sent joint Christmas cards with her live-in boyfriend.

Kelly Young, 36, of Waterfoot, Lancashire, insisted that company director Paul Carter, 54, was just the landlord of her £300,000 home.

But investigators were tipped off that Carter was actually her partner after she sent out Christmas cards last year signed: ‘From Kelly, Paul and the kids.’

Young claimed income support, housing benefit and council tax payments and said she was a single mum

Burnley Crown Court heard Young was receiving income support, housing benefit and council tax payments on the grounds that she was a single mum with four children. 

Video surveillance then confirmed he was living with her at the property, which he also owned.

On Friday prosecutor Tina Landale, for the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP), said the total overpayment to Young was £48,908.85.

Of this £30,000 was in income support, around £14,500 in housing benefit and £4,000 in council tax benefit.

The claim began legitimately in 2002, when she made a claim for herself on the basis she was a single mother-of-three, with no partner living with her and no income except child benefit.

Young later began living with Mr Carter but she did not notify the DWP that her landlord was now her partner and suspicions were aroused after neighbours received Christmas cards with both their names on.

Young was interviewed in December 2012 and initially denied she was in a relationship with Mr Carter.

She said he was her landlord, let her use his car and helped out with repairs at the house.

Amanda Johnson, defending, said: 'The defendant is remorseful for her behaviour, albeit over a prolonged period.

'She has stopped receiving benefits. The only benefit she currently receives is child benefit.'

Miss Johnson said Young worked 20 hours a week in an off-licence to provide for herself and her children.

She added: 'Her relationship with Mr Carter is perhaps an unusual one.

'He does provide some degree of support, both financially and emotionally to her, but she is the full-time carer to her children, in effect with him coming and going.

'She has learned a very harsh lesson. She is trying to put her life in some kind of order and bring up the children as best she can.

'She is someone who might benefit from assistance'.

The court heard she and Mr Carter were still coming to terms with the tragedy of losing their 21-month-old son Paul after he drowned in a bath.

An inquest last summer - which cleared the toddler's parents of any blame - heard Paul was found face down in the water. 

Young was given an eight-month suspended sentence after admitting three offences of dishonestly failing to notify a change in circumstances for benefits.

Judge Barry Searle told her for the sake of her children he would not send the now pregnant Young to prison.
