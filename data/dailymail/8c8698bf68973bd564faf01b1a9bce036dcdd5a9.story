A little girl died in agony in her parents' arms after doctors repeatedly failed to discuss the findings of a crucial MRI scan, which showed she had water on the brain, an inquest has today heard.

Alice Mason survived successful surgery to treat a brain tumour and was responding well to chemotherapy at the Royal Marsden Hospital in Chelsea in February 2011.

However, her condition deteriorated after she returned home a month later and she was taken to hospital feeling dizzy, lethargic and unable to walk or sit without help.

Alice Mason, two, died after doctors repeatedly failed to discuss the findings of an MRI scan. She had suffered irreversible brain damage following treatment for a brain tumour

Alice's parents, Rosalind and Gareth Mason, spent eight days pleading with doctors to treat their daughter, but crucial tests were repeatedly delayed.

By the time the tests were carried out at Kingston Hospital in south west London, Alice had suffered irreversible brain damage caused by water on the brain and emergency surgery could not save her.

Mr and Mrs Mason first contacted the Royal Marsden Hospital and their local hospital in Kingston raising their concerns about Alice's deterioration on March 18, 2011. 

However, doctors said the symptoms were 
likely to be linked to the chemotherapy drugs and told Alice's parents 
to wait for a routine MRI scan, due some days later.

Alice's parents Gareth and Rosalind Mason, pictured outside West London Coroners' Court, claim nine chances to treat their daughter's symptoms were missed by doctors

The scan showed signs of hydrocephalus - water on the brain - but Mr and Mrs Mason were told by the Royal Marsden to take their daughter home.

But Stergios Zacharoulis, a specialist oncologist at the hospital who was in charge of Alice’s care, admitted he failed to discuss the results of her MRI scan for three days - between March 21 and 23 - because doctors weren’t in.

He said he discussed Alice’s condition with doctors at Kingston Hospital, who were also involved in her care, and urged them to give her a CT scan if her condition got worse.

He told West London Coroner’s Court: 'I did see Alice and informed Kingston Hospital about the concerns.

'We
discussed numerous times with Kingston Hospital that we were very 
concerned. If the patient shows any other signs of deterioration we must
get a CT scan.'

And he 
said he 'regretted' not immediately referring Alice to St George’s 
Hospital in south London, where she could have been operated on.

But he said her rising temperature suggested she might have an infection and so he didn’t refer her.

He said: 'There was a rising temperature that was concerning. It was 38C at that time.

'I
wish I had done that straight away, the reason I didn’t do it was 
because we have discussed with neurosurgeons those processes and the 
first thing they say is to make sure the infection is under control 
before they operate.'

An inquest heard staff at Kingston Hospital in south London failed to act on the advice of a specialist oncologist at the Royal Marsden Hospital in Chelsea, to give Alice a CT scan if her condition worsened

Assistant Coroner Sean Cummings said he was concerned that a lack of communication led to crucial delays in Alice’s care.

He said: 'I’m concerned there seems to have been a sequence of issues in terms of communication.

'When Alice was seen on March 21 it was noted that she had some issues of unsteadiness.

'I’m finding it difficult to see why, if you went to the MRI department to discuss it on March 23 you were concerned enough to go and discuss it, but because there wasn’t anyone there you left it until the next day.

'Then nothing happened on the next day you left it again until the MDT (multi-disciplinary team) meeting, but it was cancelled.

'You say there was assistance requesting the CT scan, but that seems rather vague to me.

'I’m not sure there was a sufficient grasp on this.'

Within hours of leaving hospital in Chelsea her condition had worsened and she was admitted to Kingston Hospital, vomiting repeatedly.

But despite Dr Zacharoulis's instructions, staff at the hospital failed to order a CT scan.

And Dr Zacharoulis failed to call a consultant at Kingston to discuss the case, the inquest heard.

In total, her parents claim that nine opportunities to act on the symptoms were missed.

A few days later marked hydrocephalus - water on the brain - was eventually found, and urgent surgery ordered to drain the fluid to relieve pressure inside the skull.

But there were further delays before Alice was operated on at St George’s Hospital in south London.

Alice never regained consciousness. Further scans found that the water on the brain had caused irreversible brain damage, and she died in her parents’ arms on March 30, 2011.

The inquest continues.
