Mars may once have been rocked by titanic supervolcano eruptions that could have shaped the planet's climate, scientists believe.

Crater-like features which could be the footprints of the cataclysmic events have been discovered at several sites in the Martian northern highlands.

Scientists believe they were left behind by massive volcanic explosions that blasted ash and lava out of the planet's surface more than three billion years ago.

Mars may once have been rocked by titanic supervolcano eruptions that may have shaped the planet's climate. This image shows an area of Mars known as Eden Patera looking which is a 70-kilometre wide caldera formed by formed by the collapse of land. Scientists believe the collapse may have followed a supervolcanic eruption

Supervolcano eruptions are thousands of times stronger than those of ordinary volcanoes, and powerful enough to alter global climate and cause mass extinctions.

They have occurred in Earth's past, and a plugged supervolcano is said to be simmering beneath Yellowstone National Park in the UK today.

Rather than producing typical conical mountains of lava and ash, supervolcanoes erupt suddenly in huge explosions.

Because they do not build mountains, evidence of ancient supervolcanoes can be hard to detect.

But scientists think they may have formed a series of irregularly shaped craters in an area of Mars known as Arabia Terra.

If future work shows that supervolcanoes were present more widely on ancient Mars, it would completely change estimates of how the atmosphere formed from volcanic gases, how sediments formed from volcanic ash and how habitable the surface might have been

A volcano becomes a 'supervolcano' if it erupts more than 1,000 cubic kilometres of magma.

Their eruptions are thousands of 
times stronger than those of ordinary volcanoes, and powerful enough to 
alter global climate and cause mass extinctions.

Supervolcanos occur when magma in the mantle rises into the crust from but is unable to break through.

Pressure builds in a large and growing magma pool until the crust is unable to contain it.

Yellowstone is one example of a supervolcano on Earth. The last eruption was 630,000 years ago, and was 1,000 times bigger than the Mount St Helens eruption in 1980.

The ancient, crater-pockmarked region is covered by layers of fine-grained material of unknown origin that could have been left by explosive eruptions.

One of the best examples of what might be a supervolcano remnant is Eden Patera, a depression in the Martian surface 85km wide and 1.8km deep.

It is linked to at least three other depressions in what scientists describe as a ‘caldera complex’.

Other supervolcano candidates include the 700 metre-deep Euphrates Patera, and Siloe Patera, a nest of deep craters extending up to 1,750 metres below the surrounding plains.

The volcanoes may have produced powdery deposits identified by Nasa rovers at two landing sites, Meridiani Planum and Gale Crater.

Many Martian volcanoes are easily recognised from their massive shield-shaped structure, similar to what we see in Hawaii. 'But these are relatively youthful features on Mars and we have always wondered where the ancient volcanoes are,' said Dr Joseph Michalski, from the Natural History Museum

Gases released by the eruptions would 
have altered the Martian climate, according to the scientists writing in
the journal Nature.

‘Discovering supervolcanic structures fundamentally changes how we view ancient volcanism on Mars,’ said lead researcher Dr Joseph Michalski, from the Natural History Museum.

‘Many Martian volcanoes are easily recognised from their massive shield-shaped structure, similar to what we see in Hawaii.

‘But these are relatively youthful features on Mars and we have always wondered where the ancient volcanoes are.

‘It is possible that the most ancient volcanoes were much more explosive and formed structures similar to what we now see in Arabia Terra.’

He added: ‘It makes sense that supervolcanoes might have been more common on ancient Mars, particularly if the ancient crust was thinner than it is now.

‘This would allow magma to rise to the surface more quickly, before it could release gases within the crust.

‘If future work shows that supervolcanoes were present more widely on ancient Mars, it would completely change estimates of how the atmosphere formed from volcanic gases, how sediments formed from volcanic ash and how habitable the surface might have been.’
