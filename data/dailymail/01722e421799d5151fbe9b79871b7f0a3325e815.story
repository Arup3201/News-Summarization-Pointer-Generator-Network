A 12-year-old girl who underwent life-saving gastric sleeve surgery after gaining more than 150lbs following brain tumor surgery has returned to school 50lbs lighter.

Alexis Shapiro, who now enjoys activities including swimming again, told NBC News that she feels 'reborn' and grinned for pictures ahead of her first day back in a classroom in almost two years.

But while she has shed 50lbs and reversed her diabetes, there are still struggles; she has a hormone condition that must be treated by a drug injection minutes after symptoms appear to avoid a coma.

The pre-teen, from Cibolo, Texas was diagnosed with a rare brain tumor in 2011 and surgery to remove the mass disturbed her metabolism and left her body unable to regulate energy or appetite.

Back to school: Alexis Shapiro, 12, smiles ahead of her first day of sixth grade on Monday. It comes five months after she underwent gastric surgery to curb her weight gain following a rare brain tumor

Still smiling: When asked how her first day back to schoolwent, Alexis gave a thumbs up and a thumbs down to show that it was fine, her Facebook page explained - but she was still smiling

Alexis, previously a happy and healthy girl of normal weight, gained 151lbs in the space of two years thanks to hypothalamic obesity. She developed type 2 diabetes and other obesity-related problems.

Her parents Jenny and Ian, learned that their insurance did not cover bariatric surgery, so they set up an online crowdfunding campaign and raised more than $86,000 to cover medical costs.

Alexis went under the knife on March 21. Due to complications, what should have been a gastric bypass had to be changed to a gastric sleeve surgery at the last minute.

The sleeve gastrecomy saw her stomach permanently reduced to 25 per cent of its original size.

According to her doctors, without the surgery Alexis would have continued putting on 2lbs a week and eventually become immobile despite a strict daily regimen comprised of diet and exercise.

If her condition was left untreated, Alexis soon would have tipped the scales at whopping 400lbs.

Before surgery: She put on more than 150lbs following surgery for the brain tumor. Her parents, Jenny and Ian, turned to the internet when their insurance refused to cover the gastric surgery for Alexis

All smiles: Alexis is pictured before she was diagnosed with the life-changing rare brain tumor

But three months after the surgery, her mother revealed Alexis' type 2 diabetes was 'pretty much gone'.

At 203lbs, Alexis was also suffering form an enlarged liver, but now the large organ is substantially smaller and her blood chemicals are at normal level.

On Monday, when she returned to class, a school nurse stood by with a walkie-talkie and her emergency medicine in case her hormone condition sparked an 'adrenal crisis', NBC reported. 

The adrenal insufficiency is a side effect of the brain tumor and she also takes oral drugs to manage it. But when a crisis is on its way, she starts to get a headache, vomits and has low blood sugar.

If symptoms were to show, she would need a dose of Solu-Cortef within 30 minutes. If she does not get it, her organs will begin shutting down, her mother said.

Back in charge: Alexis is now swimming and playing like she did before and her mother says she has more confidence. She is pictured right in a swimsuit - which had been one of the little girl's aims

Jenny Shapiro said her daughter's return to school was both exciting and nerve-racking. 

'It's... a huge step in the right direction, but it's just so hard to let go,' her mother Jenny told NBC. 'I'm her security blanket. I've always been with her so I've learned her symptoms.' 

But shesaid that not only is Alexis more physically capable, she is also returning to her happy, confident self. She recalled a recent conversation that 'melted my heart'.

Her daughter told her: 'You know what? I used to see this fat little, chubby girl (in the reflection). I looked in the mirror and I saw somebody pretty. I like that girl.'
