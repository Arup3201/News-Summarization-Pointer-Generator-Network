He used to be a political mover and shaker – now he’s moving and shaking on the dance floor.

Disgraced former Tory MP Jonathan Aitken danced with his daughter, Victoria, at the launch party for her new single, 24 Hour Dancefloor.

The bash was held at trendy London nightclub Boujis, with Victoria dressed in a sequined number by designer Nina Naustdal.

When he wasn’t strutting his stuff, Mr Aitken spent time chatting to former German politician Count Carl Eduard von Bismarck, the great-great-grandson of the German Chancellor.

The guest list also included former MTV presenter Kristiane Backer and chef Gurpareet Bains.

Mr Aitken, 66, resigned from Cabinet in 1995 to sue The Guardian and Granada TV for libel, over allegations that he violated ministerial rules by allowing an Arab businessman to pay for his stay at the Ritz.

He lied on oath that his wife paid the bill and persuaded Victoria, then 14, to back this claim.The family’s Westminster home was repossessed, which Miss Aitken says was an inspiration for many of her songs.

‘I’m inspired by everyday things and what is going on around me,’ she said. ‘I think it happens to a lot of women, the guy wants you as arm candy and is so nice and charming when he wants a certain something. It’s all in the lyrics.

Mr Aitken was jailed for 18 months in 1999 for perjury and perverting the course of justice.

He said that telling a lie on oath in court during his libel trial against The Guardian was ‘catastrophe’ for his life and career.

Victoria’s first song, Vicky From The Yacht, which was released in 2009, was a pastiche of Jennifer Lopez’s Jenny From The Block - is a riches-to-rags tale of losing a fortune. Her second single, I’ll Be Your B***h, reached number five in the UK dance charts.

It also proved popular in countries including Australia, New Zealand, Argentina and Sweden.She claims that her posh accent put off some music producers.
