Shia LaBeouf made an appearance in a Manhattan criminal court early this morning.

The Nymphomaniac actor wore a sharp suit as the judge held a progress hearing following his arrest last June on disorderly conduct charges for an incident in which he yelled at and slapped actors during a Broadway performance of Cabaret starring Michelle Williams and Alan Cumming.

LaBeouf pleaded guilty to two counts of disorderly conduct, one count of trespass, one count of criminal trespass and harassment in the second degree  last September, and was ordered to undergo continued alcohol treatment.

The judge today announced she would drop the charges however in another six months if the actor was found to have complied with the program and stayed out of trouble.

The progress report comes after LaBeouf (above with lawyer) pleaded guilty in September. A judge said that if he sought treatment for alcohol and stayed out of trouble the charges would be dropped

LaBeouf, who showed up in a well-tailored grey suit and tie while still keeping his rat tail and eyebrow ring, said little to the judge, and the proceedings were over in less than an hour.

During the Cabaret melee, LaBeouf screamed profanities at performers and then slapped Cumming on the behind as he performed at the emcee.

As he was escorted from the theater he began screaming; F*** you! This is f***ing bull****!' 

He then added; 'Do you know my life? Do you know who the f*** I am? Do you know who I am?'

He is also reported to have spat on one of the police officers.

Judge Ann Scherzer announced today a plan to drop the charges againt the star in six months

LaBeouf's next court appearance has been scheduled for September 

LeBeouf has kept a relatively low profile since the incident and Judge Ann Scherzer said she is prepared to drop the charges when he returns to court in six months. 

This came as Assistant District Attorney Alyssa Russell confirmed LaBeouf has not been in trouble with the law since  September.

His constant companion and girlfriend, actress Mia Goth, was not with him for his court appearance today. Recent rumors suggest the two may have become engaged. 

The downcast star changed  into warmer clothes as he walked around the snowy city later that same day

Meanwhile, the star was later spotted walking around the chilly city as snow fell around him.

LaBeouf had changed out of his sharp suit into warmer garb, layering up with a thick grey fleece over a blue hoodie and black T-shirt plus black skinny leg trousers and heavy brown boots.

He looked downcast with his hands pushed into his pockets while he listened to music as he negotiated the slippery, wet streets.
