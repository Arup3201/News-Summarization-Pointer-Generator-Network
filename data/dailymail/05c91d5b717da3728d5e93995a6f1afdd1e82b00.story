Sunderland have agreed a £2.5million deal with Brighton for long-term target Will Buckley.

The winger was signed by Gus Poyet while manager at the Amex Stadium and he has remained an admirer.

The Black Cats boss hopes to follow the 25-year-old winger's signing by completing the protracted £14m deal for Liverpool striker Fabio Borini.

Done deal: Sunderland have agreed a fee with Will Buckley who will join up with former manager Gus Poyet

Long-term: Poyet has been a fan of Buckley's game for some time, since working with him at Brighton

The two clubs agreed a fee four weeks ago, but Poyet's efforts to convince the player to move to the Stadium of Light have so far met with frustration.

However the Uruguayan has reiterated his desire to seal the deal with the Italian and believes it could be completed before the weekend.

Poyet said: 'The idea was to have the deal done a few weeks ago, but for different reasons it was impossible, but we are confident that maybe in the next few days we can do something about Fabio.'

The 23-year-old spent last season on loan with the Black Cats, scoring 10 goals in all competitions.

Success: Borini was on loan at the Stadium of Light last season when he scored 10 times

Sticking point: While the clubs have agreed a fee, Borini has yet to finalise personal terms with Sunderland
