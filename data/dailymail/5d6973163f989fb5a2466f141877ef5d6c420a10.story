An Australian pensioner is set to reach a major milestone this week that will cement his status as the ultimate frequent flyer.

When he completes his 959th flight with Qantas Airways on Tuesday, 82-year-old John Martin will have racked up three million miles with a single airline – the equivalent of flying around the world several times over.

The former television news editor has been flying for more than 50 years, completing 148 long-haul journeys to New York and 138 flights to London along the way.

John Martin, 82, will pass the three-million mile mark when he completes his 959th flight with Qantas Airways

The retired television news editor was given the keys to Qantas' 75th Boeing 737-800, a retro-themed aircraft

He may be the world’s biggest aviation enthusiast and Qantas’ most loyal customer, as his next goal is reaching 1,000 flights with the flag carrier airline of Australia.

Mr Martin told news.com.au: ‘I made my money as a news editor, it was a good salary and a good job and I spent most of it with the tax office and Qantas, and it gave me, I think, the best life in the world. The things I’ve done, the places I’ve been, it’s been wonderful.’

As a tribute to his loyalty, the airline recently presented him with the keys to its 75th Boeing 737-800, a retro-themed aircraft with a 1970s livery featuring Qantas’ iconic flying kangaroo logo.

Mr Martin’s love for aviation and Qantas runs so deep that he often flies to a destination and back on Christmas Day because his considers airline staff his family.

And regularly flies from Sydney to Perth or Melbourne and back in one day.

Mr Martin never married and never had children, and he refuses to slow down even though his friends are encouraging him to take it easy as he grows older.

After flying all over the world, Mr Martin can name all of the 278 different aircraft he has flown on thanks to his meticulous record-keeping.

He keeps notes on every Qantas plane he has boarded and is eager to add the airline’s first Airbus A380 to his list.

Along the way he has racked up plenty of frequent flyer points, although he doesn’t allow them to accumulate.

He told news.com.au: ‘I tend to use the (points) before they get too big, because if I died before I used them, it would kill me, it would be the end of the world, I mean going up to heaven with Frequent Flyer Points unused.

‘The man upstairs says you can’t use them for the last trip, so there’s just no way.’
