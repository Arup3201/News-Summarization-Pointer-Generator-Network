Mario Balotelli will fully co-operate with the Football Association after they asked him to explain why alleged anti-Semitic comments appeared on his Instagram account.

The Liverpool striker has until 6pm on Friday to provide his observations in relation to a post that sparked controversy on Monday night.

Balotelli reposted an image of the computer game character Super Mario which read: ‘Don’t be racist — be like Mario. He’s an Italian plumber created by Japanese people who speaks English and looks like a Mexican.

Italian striker Balotelli posted a defence for the image on Monday night, saying his mother is Jewish

Balotelli wrote this apology on Twitter on Tuesday morning, claiming his post was meant to be 'anti-racist'

Balotelli’s alleged anti-Semitic Instagram post could see him face a claim from Nintendo for both copyright and trade mark infringement, says a leading law firm

Balotelli's post included a picture of Super Mario, which could land him in trouble with Nintendo, according to Irwin Mitchell.

'The use of Nintendo’s image for these purposes could get him into hot water for both copyright and trade mark infringement, especially given the content which could be said to bring Nintendo’s rights into disrepute or be denigrated,' said Georgie Collins of the London firm. 

But below, it continued: ‘jumps like a black man and grabs coin like a Jew.’

He subsequently apologised on Twitter on Tuesday for reposting the image and insisted that the image was meant to be ‘anti-racist with humour’.

His statement read: ‘I apologise if I have offended anyone… I now understand that out of context may have the opposite effect. Not all Mexicans have moustache, not all black people jump high and not all Jewish people love money.

‘I used a cartoon by someone else because it has Super Mario and I thought it was funny and not offensive. I am sorry.’ The FA, however, will continue their investigation and they can impose a minimum ban of five matches if they believe Balotelli has ‘brought the game into disrepute by making comments which included a reference to ethnic origin and/or colour and/or race’.

Balotelli has failed to win over many Liverpool fans due to his poor form since a £16m summer transfer

Nicolas Anelka was banned for five matches and fined £80,000 by the FA in February of this year after making the controversial 'quenelle' gesture after scoring for West Brom against West Ham. The Frenchman denied that his 'inverted Nazi salute' was anti-Semitic. 

Nicolas Anelka, for example, was banned for five matches in February and fined £80,000 after making the ‘quenelle’ gesture when he scored for West Brom against West Ham. 

It is the same aggravated rule breach for which Liverpool striker Luis Suarez and Chelsea’s John Terry were found guilty of on-field abuse of rival players.

A Liverpool spokesperson said: ‘We are aware of the posting which has since been promptly deleted by the player. We will be speaking to the player about this issue.’ 

Balotelli's mocked up picture, pretending to show Luis Suarez's biting his arm, was also deleted on Monday

The original picture was taken by a man wearing a USA shirt, and has been adapted by the Italian striker

Balotelli has consulted with Liverpool officials and will be given guidance during the coming days as he seeks to accurately explain his post, but he has not yet spoken to manager Brendan Rodgers. He remained on Merseyside yesterday, as Liverpool’s manager took the team for last night’s 3-1 win at Leicester City. Rodgers said after the game he knew little about an FA racism probe but would get up to speed on the situation today.

The FA’s investigation comes on the back of the controversy surrounding comments Wigan owner Dave Whelan made after appointing Malky Mackay, which include him saying in a newspaper interview that ‘Jewish people chase money more than everybody else’.

Balotelli is not the first player to find himself in trouble for making remarks on social media. Rio Ferdinand was fined £25,000 and banned for three games after being found guilty of an abusive tweet which contained the derogatory word ‘sket’. Ferdinand was found guilty of improper conduct and fined £45,000 for calling Ashley Cole a ‘Choc ice’ on Twitter in 2012.

Balotelli has frequently been in the headlines for all the wrong reasons since he joined Liverpool for £16million in August. He was quizzed by police in October in relation to an allegation that he threatened a woman in Manchester.

His form when he has played has also been poor. Balotelli has not scored in the Barclays Premier League, his only goals coming at Anfield against Ludogorets in the Champions League and Middlesbrough in the Capital One Cup.
