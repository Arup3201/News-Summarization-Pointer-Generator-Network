As a successful TV chef, you might expect Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall to urge you to eat more.

But the presenter of Channel 4’s River Cottage series has turned to fasting to offset his Christmas ‘gluttony’, he said yesterday.

He has become the latest supporter of ‘intermittent fasting’, heralded as the biggest diet revolution since the Atkins.

Dieters eat normally for five days a week but dramatically reduce their food intake on the other two days.

Fearnley-Whittingstall, 48, admitted he struggled to stick to his own River Cottage lifestyle of a diet rich in fruit and vegetables, writing: ‘At the turn of the year, like so many, I consumed way too much meat, cheese, cream, sugar and alcohol.

‘And despite a garden bursting with brussel sprouts, kale and winter 
salads, and a weekly delivery of organic apples, oranges, clementines 
and bananas, I know I didn’t eat nearly enough fruit and veg to offset 
the gluttony.’

He said he had started intermittent fasting on New Year’s Day, meaning he has gone through six days of fasting, and had lost 8lb.

The chef limited his food intake on fast days to a 250-calorie breakfast and a 350-calorie supper and drank black and herbal teas during the day to stave off hunger pangs.

Supporters claim that fasting can help dieters to lose weight, live 
longer and delay diseases including dementia, diabetes and some cancers.

The regime supposedly mimics the lifestyles of our ancestors, when 
humans had to hunt for food and did not eat high-energy foods such as 
meat, fat and sugar on a daily basis.

Writing in the Guardian, Fearnley-Whittingstall said our modern-day 
favourites like burgers and chocolate brownies were ‘delicious, but 
insane’.

He said: ‘These compound meals, too often glued together with 
synthesised products our bodies don’t even recognise as food, curdle and
 rot in our stomachs, giving us varying degrees of nausea, acid reflux, 
gaseousness and cramp, and pushing our stressed digestive systems to the
 absolute limit.

‘No wonder we’re bloating like dead whales and dropping like flies.

‘Of course, I realise that all my books and television shows are largely complicit with this disastrous approach to eating.

‘I like to think I am at the healthier, more natural end of the spectrum
 - in fact, my professional self-respect is predicated on that.

‘But I think it would be unwise not to acknowledge that even the “River 
Cottage diet” - rich as it ought to be in fresh vegetables and fruit - 
is open to abuse. And I should know: I abuse it often enough.’

The book The Fast Diet by Dr Michael Mosley tells you to eat normally for five days a week – up to 2,000 calories a day for woman and 2,500 for men.

On the other two, women limit their food intake to 500 calories a day and men 600.

Supporters claim the regime is easier to stick to than a traditional diet, and research has found links between fasting and the body’s ability to repair itself.

Dr Mosley, who presented a BBC2 Horizon programme on the subject last year, lost a stone in six weeks and cut his body fat by a quarter.

Critics question whether extreme calorie restriction is healthy and warn that fasting can be addictive.

Fearnley-Whittingstall said he felt ‘lean and sharp’ but questioned whether he would continue to fast regularly.

He said: ‘I’ve lost eight pounds already, and I find the whole thing rather exhilarating. I feel I might just be part of a health revolution.

‘But is it really sustainable, for me or for significant numbers of others? Can I honestly say I’m backing myself to be fasting regularly a year from now? ‘I very much want the answer to be yes. Then I look at the rowing machine propped up in the corner of the kids’ playroom. This time last year I was pounding it for 2,000 metres twice a week. It didn’t last past the first chocolate egg.’
