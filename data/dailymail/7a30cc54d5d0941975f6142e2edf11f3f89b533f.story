Jet passengers had to leap down an emergency chute moments after smoke was spotted pouring from the aircraft's brakes as landed.

Dozens of holidaymakers returning to Britain from Alicante had to slide down from the Jet 2 plane after it had touched down at Blackpool airport.

The incident happened just days after British passengers told of their terror when a separate Jet 2 flight was forced to make an emergency landing in Bulgaria due to loss of cabin pressure.

The Blackpool drama, on Friday, came after air traffic control spotted smoke and told the pilot to evacuate.

One passenger, Andrew Dance reported how there was a 'bumpy' landing and that people started to 'panic' after the 139 passengers on board were informed of the evacuation.

Eyewitnesses reported that some passengers suffered cuts and bruises after sliding down the chutes, though the airline says everyone on board evacuated 'safely'.

Lancashire Fire and Rescue said they were called to assist emergency response staff at the airport, but their services were not required.

A  Jet 2 spokesman told the Blackpool Gazette: ‘The captain was advised to evacuate flight LS740 from Alicante as a precautionary measure after Blackpool Airport air traffic control spotted smoke coming from the brakes on landing.

‘All passengers evacuated safely and are being cared for by our team at the airport. A full investigation is now underway.’

The Boeing 737-330 landed at about 1.20pm on Friday before the chutes were deployed.

Days earlier, on June 4,  a separate Jet 2 flight LS516 had to divert to Sofia Airport in Bulgaria after the plane started to rapidly descend just an hour after departing from Paphos, Cyprus, to Newcastle.

The plane dropped thousands of feet in minutes, while oxygen masks were deployed for passengers.

Passengers then had to spend the night in the Bulgarian capital, before boarding an early replacement flight to Newcastle.

On that occasion, a Jet 2 spokesman apologised to customers and said the flight was diverted as a 'precautionary measure due to a technical issue'.
