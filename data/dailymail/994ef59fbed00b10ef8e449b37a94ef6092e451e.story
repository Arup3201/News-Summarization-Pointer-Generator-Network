Alastair Cook could never have imagined what was ahead of him when he lifted the Ashes urn at The Kia Oval this time last year, but the England captain now has the opportunity to consign 12 months of near total misery to history.

A win for Cook’s ‘new’ side in the final Investec Test would not only complete a series victory over India but would draw a line under the recriminations which accompanied the unravelling of one of the most successful of all England teams.

The famous old south London ground is a worthy venue for Cook, the highest profile survivor of the Australia whitewash fall-out, to attempt to silence any remaining doubts that he truly is the best man to take England forward.

Year's a long time! Alastair Cook and England were lifting the Ashes at the Oval in August 2013 

Look what's happened since: Australia reclaimed the little urn with ease Down Under last winter

ENGLAND (probable): Cook (capt), Robson, Ballance, Bell, Root, Moeen, Buttler (wkt), Woakes, Jordan, Broad, Anderson.

INDIA (probable): Vijay, Gambhir, Pujara, Kohli, Rahane, Dhoni (capt/wkt), Jadeja, Ashwin, Kumar, Ishant Sharma, Aaron.

Umpires: Kumar Dharmasena (SL) and Paul Reiffel (Aus). TV umpire: Tim Robinson (Eng).

Match referee: Ranjan Madugalle (SL).

Pitch: Looked a bit greener than usual yesterday and England hope it has more pace and carry than last year.

TV and Radio: LIVE on Sky Sports 2 from 10am and on BBC Radio 5 Live Sports Extra from 10.25am.

Weather: South London looks set to be dry, but possibly cloudy, for the bulk of the Test.

Not only has Cook twice been part of an Ashes-clinching side at The Oval but it was here that he saved his England skin with a century against Pakistan four years ago during what was, before now, the toughest time of his career.

‘We were running around the ground this morning and Stuart Broad said to me, “It doesn’t seem a year ago we were lifting the Ashes here”,’ said Cook. ‘I said, “It might not to you but it does to me!”

‘A lot has happened over the past year and I guess the beauty of sport is that you never know what’s going to happen next.

‘We’ve made a big stride forward over the last couple of weeks and this is another little challenge now. How do we cope when we’re up in the series? Can we finish the job? I hope the next year is a lot more successful and less eventful!’

There are certainly real signs of progress for England, through the form of the likes of Joe Root, Gary Ballance and Moeen Ali, but it is one of the senior core of players who have finally come to the fore in the last two thumping victories who is poised to hog the limelight over the next five days.

Jimmy Anderson stands seven short of Sir Ian Botham’s record as England’s leading Test wicket-taker and Cook paid tribute to the leader of his attack while remembering the uncertain start of their relationship.

‘If he breaks the record here it will probably mean England are in a very strong position,’ said Cook. ‘It’s an amazing achievement for the most skilful bowler in the world.

All smiles: Alastair Cook has been questioned but is re-finding form in both his batting and captaincy

Mean Machine: James Anderson is on the cusp of becoming England's all-time leading Test wicket taker 

Long time ago: England don't appear to be missing the sacked Kevin Pietersen this summer 

‘You saw his guts and determination last week when he was bowling so well at Old Trafford despite being ill. That tells me what sort of bloke he is and to back that up with talent and skill makes him a very fine bowler.’

The pair are firm friends but it was not that way when they first met. ‘I played against Jimmy for Essex against Lancashire and he called me all the names under the sun,’ said Cook.

‘Then we went on an A tour of West Indies together and we never spoke. We both got called up by England to go to India and I thought, “This is going to be an interesting 48 hours”. But we talked on the plane and now we’re good friends. What amazes me is how he keeps trying to improve.’

If all eyes will be on Anderson and Broad — who will play with either a splint or a mask protecting his broken nose — then there will be three other England players with much to prove against what looks a deflated India.

This is a huge game for Sam Robson who, since hitting a century against Sri Lanka in his second Test, has struggled outside off stump and it is conceivably his last chance to prove he should open against his native Australia next year. ‘It is vitally important we get a settled partnership at the top of the order,’ said Cook. ‘Robbo has had a tough couple of games but that can happen when you open.

‘This is a hurdle he has to get over and I’ve no doubt he can do it. He has to back his ability to score runs and prove himself as an international performer.’

The stakes are almost as high for Chris Woakes and Chris Jordan, who both seem certain to keep their places ahead of Ben Stokes and Steven Finn despite failing to convince in this series that they are the right back-up to the big two.

Yet England’s problems suddenly seem so much smaller than those of India, who have fallen apart and lost focus so spectacularly over the last two Tests in Southampton and Manchester after winning so impressively at Lord’s.

Man on a mission: Anderson has been England's key man in recent Tests as they recorded two wins 

Ishant Sharma, who destroyed England with seven wickets on that last, turbulent day at Lord’s, is fit to return, which should give India a boost, but whether captain MS Dhoni is in the mood to capitalise on it remains in doubt.

Dhoni’s captaincy and performance on the last day at Old Trafford were little short of bizarre and, incredibly, he decided to have a day off on Wednesday, apparently to indulge his hobby of shooting, rather than practise with the rest of his side.

It is the sort of behaviour that would lead to castigation if he were England captain.

‘I felt like having a day off and took one,’ said a dismissive Dhoni. ‘It’s personal. I was with the team for the three days after Old Trafford and we had enough team-building activities. One more day won’t make any difference.’

It is an arrogant attitude which should help England’s attempt to seal a series win here that would mean the world to them and vindicate their own captain.

Not bothered? MS Dhoni didn't even bother to train with the Indian team on Wednesday and went shooting
