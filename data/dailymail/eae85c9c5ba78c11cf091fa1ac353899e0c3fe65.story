Jailed: Aubrey Anderson has been sentenced to four years in a Belgian prison

A nanny who broke a baby's legs in Utah has been sentenced to four years in prison for an almost identical crime she committed in Belgium.

Aubrey Anderson could now be extradited to Europe after being convicted in a Belgian court of assaulting a pair of twins who were just 16 days old.

The 32-year-old has denied the charges, and says she may voluntarily travel to Belgium to defend herself in a possible retrial.

In June 2011, Anderson became the nanny to a pair of newborn twins in Bruges.

Just over two weeks after their birth, their parents took them to hospital where they discovered that their arms and legs had been fractured multiple times.

However, during the hospital visit Anderson took the chance to flee the country, and has been wanted by Belgian police ever since.

She is believed to have offered her services as a childminder, and early last year was taken on as a nanny by a couple in Park City, Utah.

Anderson was hired to look after a pair of twin babies, around one month old, overnight.

But when the day nanny noticed that one of the children had bruises and swollen limbs, their parents took them to the doctor.

It then emerged that one of twins had two broken ankles, leading Anderson to be prosecuted for child abuse.

Following a plea deal with prosecutors, she was handed five years of probation earlier this month.

But now a judge in Belgium has sentenced Anderson to four years in prison in a hearing held in her absence.

Belgian authorities will now seek to begin extradition proceedings so that the nanny can serve out her sentence.

A treaty between Belgium and the U.S. allows the countries to extradite criminals sentenced to one year or more in prison.

'Our office has always believed that Belgium had a strong case against her and that she would face justice in that country,' Summit County Attorney David Brickey said in a statement.

Anderson's defence lawyer Clayton Simms has suggested that she will be given a retrial if she travels to Belgium, and said she may go voluntarily.

'She may choose to waive extradition and go there and face the court,' he told the Deseret News. 'She feels strongly that she has a good position, that she's innocent.'
