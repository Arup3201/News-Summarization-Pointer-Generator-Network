Hospital staff were forced to evacuate child patients from a paediatric ward at a London Hospital after a fox plunged through a ceiling.

It is believed the animal clambered onto the roof of the North Middlesex University Hospital in Edmonton, north London, while building work was underway.

Eight children were evacuated and staff contacted the RSPCA, who helped the animal escape out of a window.

A hospital spokesman said no-one was hurt, and that the fox fell through into a 'non-patient' area of the ward.

It got onto the roof of a neighbouring building and then broke into the ward's roof space, where it fell through the panels.

The spokesman added that the entrance to the roof space was blocked off immediately after the event.

The ward was shut for three days while the building was secured.

It is thought more than 10,000 foxes live close to humans in London, while 33,000 live in urban areas across Britain.

Urban foxes in the capital are seen as a growing problem and have even attacked infants.

A baby had its finger torn off when it was attacked by a fox in Bromley, south-east London in February 2013.

Mother Hayley Cawley, 28, walked into her living room to find five-week-old Denny Dolan ‘covered in blood’ and a fox dragging the infant towards the front door.

Little Denny also suffered puncture wounds to the face from the animal's fangs 

She managed to wrestle her baby out of the animal’s mouth, but his finger was torn off in the attack.

Denny had a five-hour operation to have his finger reattached.

Mr Dolan’s sister Lorraine Murphy, 42, said her brother had told her what had happened and she had ‘feared the worst’ after the baby was taken to hospital.

Speaking at the time, she said: ‘The fox was trying to drag the baby out of the house. Hayley kicked the fox and it ran away.

'The baby was covered with blood and his hand was badly damaged. The fox was shaking the baby by his hand in its teeth and hitting him off the door frame. There was blood everywhere.'

Scarred: Isabella and Lola Koupparis were left with 'life-changing' injuries after a fox attacked them in their cot

In June 2010 a mother was horrified when she discovered her twin girls mauled by a fox in their cots.

Fashion designer Pauline Koupparis found her nine-month-old daughters covered in blood in the bedroom of their home in in Hackney, North-East London.

Isabella and Lola Koupparis were left with 'life-changing' injuries after the attack, which took place as the girls’ parents sat downstairs.

The fox crept in through sliding French windows which were open because of the heat and up the stairs into the girls’ bedroom.

Ms Koupparis said: ‘It’s something I would never expect to happen to anybody, let alone happen to my beautiful girls.'

In May last year two of the eight ravens kept at the Tower of London were killed by a fox, prompting staff to beef up their security arrangements.

A fox lived in The Shard in London as it was being built, surviving on scraps of food left by builders. It is thought more than 10,000 foxes live close to humans in London. File picture

In 2011 an inquisitive fox was discovered living the high life at the top of the UK's tallest skyscraper.

The intrepid visitor spent two weeks roaming free and surviving on scraps of food left by builders at the 288 metre Shard building at London Bridge.

The animal, named Romeo by staff, is thought to have entered via the central stairwell before conquering the climb to reach the building's roof.

Romeo was caught by Southwark Council pest control officers and taken to Riverside Animal Centre in Wallington, where the hungry explorer was given a thorough medical and a few good meals, before being released back into the wild.

In August 2013 Leon Smith awoke in his home in Hampton Hill, South-West London, and reached out to cuddle his girlfriend, only to discover a fox in his bed.

After a 10-minute stand-off the fox only ran away after the IT consultant charged at it shouting.

'I just thought it was the cat, so I thought nothing of it,' Mr Smith said. 'It had walked up my back and was licking my neck for a good couple of seconds.

It is thought the animal got in through the catflap.
