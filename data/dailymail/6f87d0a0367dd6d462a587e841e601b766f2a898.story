A baby died from catastrophic head injuries when his mother lost her grip and he fell on to an airport baggage carousel, witnesses revealed last night.

Her screams rang out across the arrivals hall at Alicante airport bringing police rushing to the scene.

The 32-year-old American tourist had just arrived in Spain from Gatwick with her Canadian husband and their two children. The baby was just five months old.

Airport staff said the woman, who was also travelling with an older child, clambered onto the unmoving luggage belt

The parents were reportedly questioned about the tragic incident, and are being offered counselling

One theory under investigation is that 
she climbed on to the belt to grab a pushchair which had become stuck in
 the stationary chute.

When it began to move, she apparently lost her balance and dropped the baby carrier, according to Spanish newspaper Informacion.

Airport staff said the accident happened in seconds, giving the mother no time to react.

An
 airport worker added: ‘The youngster ended up trapped in a 10cm hole 
where two belts converge. The boy appeared to have suffered from a 
fractured skull.’ 

Other 
witnesses said the mother was standing beside the carousel holding her 
son and lost her grip as she leaned down to grab the pram.

A
 female easyJet worker said: ‘We heard the baby was in a carrier, but it
 tipped over and his head became trapped in a gap while it was moving. 
It is so sad.’ 

The family are
 believed to have travelled to the resort town of Denia, 60 miles from 
the airport and are staying at the hotel where they were due to be 
holidaying. 

The British Red 
Cross has sent a psychologist and social worker to support them. An 
airport spokesman said: ‘A woman was travelling with her baby and her 
child on Wednesday when there was an accident.

The mother's horrified cries brought airport personnel including police and security to the scene

The baby boy was placed on the conveyer belt at Alicante airport (pictured) when it was activated and he was killed

‘It all happened very quickly. The staff and the doctor went immediately to assist the baby but they could not help.’ 

The
 spokesman dismissed police claims that the carousel had been stationary
 when the ‘baby carrier’s weight activated the belt’, setting it in 
motion. ‘It wouldn’t start automatically from something being placed on 
it,’ she added. 

Spanish police said the  parents had been questioned and officers were investigating.

Yesterday,
 airport managers visited the scene to photograph the baggage belt, 
which was meant specifically for larger items such as bicycles, 
pushchairs and surfboards.

A 
46-year-old woman from Essex, who had been waiting beside the carousel 
when the accident happened, said: ‘It doesn’t look dangerous because it 
is flat. I just can’t imagine how it happened.’

But
 airport staff later said the woman, who was travelling with an older 
child as well, clambered onto the luggage belt, after the pushchair got 
stuck in a chute. 

As she couldn't reach it, she placed her foot on an 'automatic mechanism' which set the belt in motion.

The mother’s horrified screams brought airport personnel, including police and security, to the scene.

Medical
 staff attempted to revive him but he had visible injuries to the head, 
and appeared to have suffered a cranial fracture, Informacion reported.

He was declared dead at the scene, in the baggage hall of Alicante- Elche airport.

The baby was pronounced dead by the airport’s on-call 
doctor.

'The youngster ended up trapped in a 10cm hole where two belts converge,' it said.

'The boy appeared to have suffered from a fractured skull.'

There were reports that the family had to
 wait until a judge arrived before the baby could be moved, in 
accordance with Spanish law.

Alicante Airport management company Aena said the baby was on the belt that delivers outsize luggage when the accident happened

Paramedics rushed to save the child's life at the airport but he was declared dead at the scene

The unnamed family had flown from London with budget airline easyJet.

The
 woman’s husband, who had been previously reported as travelling separately from his family, was reportedly with his children and partner in the baggage hall when the incident happened.

After
 disembarking from the plane shortly before midnight on Wednesday, the 
mother and her two children entered the terminal and arrived at the 
baggage reclaim area.

Spanish police said the dead baby's parents have been questioned.

A
 spokesman for Guardia Civil in Alicante said: 'I can confirm the death 
of a five month old baby at the airport. We are investigating the 
causes.

'As part of the investigation the mother and father have been questioned.'

A spokesman for the Forensic Anatomy Service in Alicante confirmed that a post-mortem had taken place.

He said: 'The results of the tests will not be available for at least two weeks, and not until they are passed to the courts, who will review the case.'

The family were said to be travelling to the nearby resort town of Denia and are staying at the hotel where they were 
due to be holidaying as they deal with the aftermath of the tragedy.

Civil Guard and National Police spokesmen confirmed that the mother is American and the father is Canadian, CNN reported.

The Guardia Civil were the first to respond to the accident at the airport but she was declared dead at the scene

One airport worker said the baby boy was crushed by the conveyer belt after it was activated

Police sources said the boy's American mother had flown into Alicante-Elche Airport from Gatwick with the little boy and his older brother

Officials could not confirm the exact circumstances of the death.

Passengers at Alicante airport appeared unaware of the tragedy as they stood next to the luggage belt to collect their pushchairs and
suitcases.

A group of British men sat on the edge of the belt as
they waited for golf clubs, while a group of teenagers collected their
musical instruments.

An emergency stop button was visible on both sides of the
belt, while a sign warned there was a 'risk of entrapment' and showed a picture
of a hand reaching out towards cogs.

The Guardia Civil said it was investigating the incident, but said it was treating the matter as an accident.

The family had just arrived for a holiday in the Spanish resort when the tragedy happened

A
 spokesman said: ‘We are still in the early stages of the investigation 
and looking at CCTV footage, but it seems that it was an accident.

‘The mother left the baby on the conveyor belt, which can be activated by detecting weight or by an airport employee.

‘It seems that the baby carrier’s weight activated the belt and the child was trapped in the rollers in the drop zone.’

A spokesman at the American embassy in Madrid said: 'The U.S. Embassy in Madrid is aware of the tragic death of a U.S. citizen child in Alicante and is providing appropriate consular assistance. 

'Due to privacy considerations, we have no further comment.'

The Canadian Embassy in Madrid would not comment.

Alicante
 airport is the sixth busiest in Spain based on passenger numbers. It is
 the main airport for the province, which is a popular summer holiday 
destination for thousands of Britons, many of whom own homes in the 
region.

The weather there is
 still sunny and warm, with temperatures nearing 30C (86F) this week, 
making it an attractive destination as a cold spell grips northern 
Europe.

Last month, a two-year-old girl on holiday in the area fell into a swimming pool and drowned as her mother slept in a hammock nearby.

Police
 said Isabella May Crump was staying at a relative’s villa on the coast 
with her parents, grandparents and four-year-old brother when the 
tragedy happened.

Her mother, Deborah Ridgway, 26, woke up to see her daughter’s body floating in the water.
