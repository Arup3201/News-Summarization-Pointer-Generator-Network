Police found 30 different drugs in the hotel room of Noelene and Yvana Bischoff, the Australian mother and teenage daughter who died on the first day of a dream holiday to Bali.

The medications were discovered in a toiletries bag and included asthma inhalers, over-the-counter pills such as Nurofen and Imodium and vitamins.

Officers also recovered Camidryl, a strong anti-allergy drug made in Indonesia and Kalmethasone, a medicine administered by injection and used to treat severe asthma.

A pack of needles – one of which appeared to have been used – was also in the room at the Padang Bay Resort, in East Bali.

Ms Bischoff, a nurse, and her 14-year-old daughter fell seriously ill hours after dining at The Buddha Bar and Restaurant on Friday night.

The 54-year-old, from Queensland, died while being taken by ambulance to Bali International Medical Clinic in Denpasar. Her daughter passed away at the clinic without knowing her mother was dead.

On Tuesday, the family of the Bischoffs won a battle with the Indonesian authorities for the pair’s autopsies to take place in Australia.

Relatives believe that both died as a result of fish poisoning, a claim which the Buddha Bar’s management has vehemently denied.

The discovery of the medications has thrown fresh doubts over the cause of the deaths, but Richard Day, Professor of Clinical Pharmacology at St Vincent’s Hospital, says the drugs found were common among overseas travellers, describing them as 'standard medicines'.

'There would be a mixture of being cautious and being a health professional, more cautious, in addition to having pre-existing conditions of asthma and migraines,' he said.

Arrangements were being made to fly the bodies home at the earliest opportunity, but it could take some time to determine the causes of death, due to the discovery of the medications.

'There are lots of samples from the vomit, the medicines and the drink,' head of Denpasar Police Forensic Laboratory, Agus Budiartha, said.

'Since they're all abroad medicines, from the country where they're from, we might have some difficulties because it's not what's usually used in Indonesia.'

It is understood that at 1.15am on Saturday the daughter begged for help from hotel security, saying she and her mother were ill

They dined at The Buddha Bar and Restaurant attached to the resort on Friday night after checking in that afternoon

Indonesian authorities have suggested the mother and daughter died from an allergy and not poisoning, but the family insists the pair did not suffer from allergies.

'We've been told it is fish they've eaten,' Mrs Bischoff's brother-in-law, Kevin Bowe said to the ABC.

'We are sticking to that at the moment. That was the report from DFAT (Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade).'

The resort's hotel manager, Giovanni Bareato, has denied this.

'It's a big fish so we would have eaten the same one,' Mr Bareato told The Australian. 'We haven't fallen ill and I know of no one else who has fallen ill from the food.'

The bill for the meal shows the mother and daughter had juices, lemon tea, chicken, pizza and fish

The resort's hotel manager Giovanni Bareato denied the claim of food poisoning

The family is aware that results from overseas autopsies may not be recognised by Indonesia's legal system, but say they aren’t looking for a criminal conviction.

'We want the truth,' Keryn Bischoff, Nolene's sister-in-law, said.

'We want to know if it was an accident, or if it wasn't an accident. Were they poisoned, or was it something else?'
