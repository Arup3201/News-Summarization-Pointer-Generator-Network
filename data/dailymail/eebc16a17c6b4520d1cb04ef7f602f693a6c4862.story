As far as proposals go, it's one to tell the grandchildren.

A loved-up passenger on board an Emirates A380 flight from Dubai to Brisbane surprised his girlfriend by proposing at 35,000ft.

The heartwarming moment was captured on camera - and even reveals a member of the cabin crew bursting into a rendition of Louis Amstrong's What A Wonderful World.

The touching footage shows an anxious Stuart Mackinnon gearing up to ask Victoria Loudon to be his wife.

The couple, from Cumbernauld, Scotland, were travelling from Dubai to Australia.

Stuart sought the help of the carrier's Flight Purser and together with the cabin crew, they found a creative way to help him with his proposal.

Enlisting the 
Baradene College Concert Band, who were also travelling on the 
flight, crew transformed the on board lounge into the perfect 
setting for the special moment.

One member of staff even stretched her vocal cords with a rendition of Louis Armstrong's What A Wonderful World.

After handing Victoria a bunch of flowers, Stuart got down on one knee to ask her to marry him.

Much to his and his fellow passengers' delight, Stuart received a resounding ‘yes’.

'It was always going to be a truly special moment in my life but what happened took it to a level I could never have imagined,' he said.

'There could have been no better setting anywhere in the world.

'The nerves I had were put at ease with the fantastic crew members, the Captain and all the passengers.'

She said yes! The happy couple celebrate their fragment on the Emirates A380 flight
