Ticketek and Ticketmaster have been forced to change the way they display the price of concert tickets after a consumer watchdog investigation found customers were being hit with hidden charges.

The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission said the ticketing companies must include unavoidable fees in the total price of tickets earlier in the booking process when customers buy online.

ACCC Deputy Chair Delia Rickard said service and handling fees must be clearly advertised to avoid consumers being misled.

'Drip feeding consumers with hidden charges has the potential to cause detriment to competition and to consumers,' Ms Rickard said.

'The steps taken by these ticketing companies should give consumers more clarity up front about the total cost of buying tickets for entertainment events.'

As part of its drip pricing investigation, the ACCC came across three main ticketing fees charged by the companies.

Both Ticketek and Ticketmaster both charge 'payment processing fees' for purchases made using debit or direct cards. Ticketek charges 1.95 percent.

Ticketek also charges a 'service/delivery fee', the cost of which varies between events. Ticketmaster charges a 'handling fee'.

The ACCC said the companies cooperated with the investigation and have changed their practices.

'To address the concerns raised the businesses now incorporate their minimum Payment Processing Fees into the per ticket prices they display on their websites,' the watchdog said in a statement.

'Ticketek also now incorporates its Service/Delivery Fee into the total price displayed as soon as it is calculable, which it considers to be once the customer has selected the number of tickets for purchase and the delivery method.

'Similarly, Ticketmaster now incorporates its Handling Fee into the total price displayed once the user has selected the total number of tickets for purchase.'
