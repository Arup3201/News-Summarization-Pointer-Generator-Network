Meet Rudi Valentino, the 36-year-old orangutan dubbed the Van Gogh of primates for his artistic flair and flawless brushstrokes.

Visitors at Houston Zoo flock to Rudi's enclosure to watch the master at work, as he paints everything from canvas to trees with calm dexterity.

When he is not creating, the primate spends hours musing on his next work.

The Vincent Van Gogh of primates: Rudi Valentino, 36 (pictured) loves to paint his enclosure at Houston Zoo with non-toxic acrylic paints

Constantly evolving: Rudi (pictured) initially used his fingers to paint with watercolors but now uses paintbrushes and acrylic paint

Orangutan keeper Tammy Buhrmester told Chron.com that Rudi has an artistic temperament and loves to create.

'Rudi's very precise when he paints. 
It's not like a wild brush, he's very particular about his paint,' she said.

'Some days he wants to paint, some days he doesn't want to 
paint. Some days one little dot is enough and some days he has to do the
 whole canvas.

'If the 
paint's out, he'll fill his water and make watercolors. He'll paint his floor, he paints the wall in his night 
house, he paints newspaper.'

Tasty: Sometimes Rudi likes to eat the paint, but keepers say it is non-toxic and safe to ingest

Buhrmester said Rudi's love of 
painting started 10 years ago when he used chalk and his fingers to 
express himself with watercolors, before moving to bamboo shoots.

His style has now evolved to painting with with non-toxic acrylic paint - which he likes to eat - and brushes on canvas.

'Yesterday
 he did one (a painting) and (we) named it ‘Phytoplankton’ and it was 
blue with pink swirls in it, it was actually really pretty,' Buhrmester 
told ABC News.

'Sometimes we look at them and we can see so many different objects in them, like birds or people.'

Talent: Rudi likes to experiment with a diverse color palette, but his favorite color is pink

Rudi’s work will be auctioned off at the Houston Zoo on April 10 for the Pongos Helping Pongos art auction and exhibit.

Although the works of many Asian animals, such as elephants, clouded leopards, and babirusa pigs, will be on display, Rudi is considered the star artist.

The exhibition, which began in 2004, has raised more than $200,000 for wild orangutans and other Asian animals.
