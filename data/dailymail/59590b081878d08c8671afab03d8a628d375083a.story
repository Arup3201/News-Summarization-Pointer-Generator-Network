A gossip site has taken the controversial decision to post the name of every licensed gun owner in New York City online as the debate over gun control rages on.

Gawker posted the list of names, which is already publicly available, today. It follows the move by the Journal News to publish home addresses of gun permit owners in Westchester and Rockland counties last month.

The list was highlighted in the midst of heated debates over gun laws following the Sandy Hook massacre in December where 20 schoolchildren and six teachers were shot dead.

On the list: As well as Journal News the website Gawker published a 446-page list of licensed gun owners in New York City

The 446-page document is readily available from the NYPD with a Freedom of Information Law request - but contains only the names of gun owners and not addresses.

However a secondary list exists online which shows both names and addresses as New York State requires that gun owners register with them and not just a local police department.

Some 1.2 million New Yorkers are licensed to own handguns - and the addresses of 300,000 of these individuals have been online since 2010.

An hour after the list was published on Gawker, the site reported that it had received death threats.

Calling for change: The debate on gun control has been heightened following the Sandy Hook massacre on December 14 in Newtown, Connecticut

One caller said 'You're f****** dead' while another told a female employee that she better have protection when she left her workplace. The site had contacted police about the threats.

Hundreds of comments were posted about the article and whether the decision to once again bring attention to gun permit holders was necessary.Â 

Referring to the earlier piece in the Journal News, one commenter wrote: 'The journal posted
 my address and name for my gun ownership. My past stalker saw this. I 
haven't heard from him in two years, because I disappeared.

'Now he is 
back and calling me......thanks to people like you bunch of a*******, 
looks like I will have to protect myself from becoming a murder victim. 
Gracias.'

The New York Police Department demands that those who wish to obtain a handgun permit appear in person with their application at the license division.

You must be 21 to apply for a handgun license or a rifle/shotgun permit.

The license may be necessary for work, in which case, the applicant will be screened by an officer.

The NYPD recommends that individuals think carefully about whether they wish to own a handgun due to safety concerns.

The department also recommends that a potential owner receives safety instruction about handguns.

Another post read: 'Don't really 
understand the negative replies to this. It's public information that 
apparently the majority of New Yorkers didn't know was available that 
EVERY person who signed up for the permit knew was public info.

'Unless we're all going on the premise
 that if people know you own a gun you are less safe. Which if true 
pretty much defeats the entire non-sporting reason for owning one, 
doesn't it?'

After publishing the names and 
addresses of gun permit owners in the upstate counties of Rockland and 
Westchester last month, the Journal News  was forced to hire a team of armed guards to patrol its headquarters in West Nyack.

The paper caused a stir on December 23 with an interactive map on its website of pistol permit holders.

Journal News editor Caryn A. McBride 
hired security guards to patrol the paper's offices amid a flurry of 
angry emails and phone calls in the following days.

Rob Seubert of Silver Spring, Maryland, 
posted on the newspaper's web site: 'Do you fools realize that you also 
made a map for criminals to use to find homes to rob that have no guns 
in them to protect themselves? What a bunch of liberal boobs you 
all are.'

Some critics retaliated by posting reporters' and editors' addresses and other personal information online.

Naming names: The paper caused a stir on December 23 when it listed thousands of pistol permit holders in suburban Westchester and Rockland counties just north of New York City in an interactive map on its website
