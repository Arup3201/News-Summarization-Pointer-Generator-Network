A lawyer from Borat's home country of Kazakhstan could be jailed for up to 10 years after slapping a judge with a fly swatter because he was unhappy with the way a case was proceeding.

Evgeniy Tankov, 35, from Karaganda, was looking after an inheritance case on behalf of a client when he lost his temper.

CCTV footage shows Mr Tankov approach the judge before saying: 'Let's not hang about arguing the law here, let's decide this with fly swatters.'

The judge was initially patient and ignored Mr Tankov, but after being struck several times he got up from his desk and wrestled with him

He then uses a fly swatter to slap the judge who patiently ignores him as he's struck three times.

Opposing lawyer, Artem Ibragilov, however, wasn't quite as understanding.

The 39-year-old is seen in the footage punching Mr Tankov, who has glasses and a ponytail. 

Moments later the judge gets up from behind his desk and wrestles with Mr Tankov.

He is seen pulling the fly swatter out of the lawyer's hand and throwing it to the floor, causing his desk to topple over.

Court officials said Mr Tankov had been barred from pracising law and has been charged with assault which carries a maximum penalty of 10 years.
