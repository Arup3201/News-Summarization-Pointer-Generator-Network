A well-known Oklahoma pastor has been jailed in the
Philippines after being accused with child molestation and trying to cover up a
sex abuse problem among orphanages he runs in the country.

Almost 20,000 people have joined a Facebook page pleading
for the release of Pastor Tom Randall. Prosecutors have yet to file charges,
but also jailed two of his colleagues in the country. They could be put to
death if convicted.

Mr Randall is known most widely as the PGA Champions Tour
minister, but also for running several charities and touring the world with his
missionary basketball teams, according to his ministry's website.

Posts to the Facebook page update supporters to the state of Mr Randall and his wife Karen. She has traveled to Manila and visits him daily.

Ms Randall is also attending his hearings and lobbying American officials in the country to help free her husband, so far without luck.

The Pastor is in the Philippines tending to the four orphanages he runs in the country that help homeless
children, according to the page. He was also set to tour the country for a series of basketball exhibitions before his jailing.

He and two local men identified only as Toto and Jake were
arrested Sunday and accused of both child molestation and trying silence their
victims.

Mr Randall’s problems began when a rival missionary made
accusations against the popular pastor and authorities started investigating
the claims, according to NewsNet 5.

He was cleared in that investigation, but the missionary
kept pressing authorities until Mr Randall was jailed.

In the time since their jailing, Mr Randall’s health has
declined, according to posts on the Facebook page.

‘Yesterday was a difficult day health wise and so they
finally started him on a glucose drip in the evening,’ his wife Karen wrote. ‘I think he
probably would have been okay to go to the hospital but he didn't want to leave
Toto and Jake.’

Pastor Joe Coffee, a friend has also provided many updates to the page.

One details an afternoon in which Mr Randall was juggling for prison guards before passing out.

Others give day to day updates plead with fans to call the U.S. Embassy in Manila, as well as local officials in the country, begging for the pastor's release.

Mr Randall performs many tricks and often involves students
from his orphanages in the exhibitions, according to his website.

It was not the first time the pastor has had problems in the
country.

‘He once told me there was people that didn’t like him
there, that wanted him dead,’ PGA Tour pro, and friend, Jim Woodward told KFOR.
‘I always said, 'Why do you go back?' That’s how strongly he felt about those
children.’

The government said a decision whether or not to prosecute
may come as soon as Wednesday, his wife wrote. The maximum penalty in the
country for such crimes is death.
