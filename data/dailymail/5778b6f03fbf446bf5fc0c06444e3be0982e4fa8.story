Edvard Musik, 46, admitted causing death by dangerous driving after he ploughed into the back of Angela Knight's car and killed her

A Lithuanian lorry driver who killed a mother after he crashed into the back of her car while fiddling with his satnav on the motorway has been jailed for four years.

Edvard Musik had been driving for 13 hours across Europe and made several drop offs in England before he caused the multi-vehicle crash on the M606 in Bradford, West Yorkshire, a court heard.

Mother-of-two, Angela Knight, 47, was directly in front of his 35-tonne articulated lorry in queuing traffic when he ploughed into the back of her Ford Fiesta and caused her 'catastrophic injuries'.

Another lorry and a car were involved in the crash, shortly after 2pm on October 7 last year, which left two other people injured and a 60-year-old seriously hurt.

Bradford Crown Court heard the former Russian army soldier was driving at around 45mph on the approach to a junction at the Staygate roundabout on the northbound carriageway.

Prosecutor Jonathan Sharp said: 'A connection to his sat nav had become loose, and he was leaning across the cab in order to deal with it.

'He returned his attention to the road just before he was to collide with the Fiesta. As the defendant caught the rear of the Fiesta, the impact speed was between 41 and 45 mph.

'The Fiesta spun several times, and collided hard with the Renault Laguna in front of it. The Laguna, in turn, collided with a Morrisons lorry.'

Mrs Knight, of Lymm, Cheshire, was on her way to visit one of her daughters, Sophie, 19, who was a student at the University of Bradford.

The 47-year-old, who was due to remarry in December last year, suffered 'catastrophic injuries to her skull and brain' and was pronounced dead at the scene.  

Musik, 46, started his shift at 1am in Europe that day and travelled to Dover, made deliveries in Birmingham before travelling to Bradford but had taken his regulation number of breaks.

The Lithuanian national, who appeared in court alongside an interpreter, pleaded guilty to causing death by dangerous driving and wept as he was jailed by Judge Roger Thomas QC.

The court heard he had no previous convictions or any driving offences and had been driving lorries for almost 30 years after leaving the Russian army in 1988.

Mitigating Paul Walker told the court Musik had written a letter to Mrs Knight's family to apologise for the 'horrific accident' and was in tears at the roadside.

Jailing Musik, Judge Thomas told him: 'This was an utterly avoidable accident if you were paying any attention whatsoever. It was a grossly avoidable distraction.

'The consequences of that for Mrs Knight's family and friends are truly terrible. Whatever sentence I pass will be of very little comfort to them.

'You lifted out of your seat and were fiddling with a sat nav in your vehicle. You hit the back of Mrs Knight's car and you did so at a considerable speed, in these circumstances at over 40mph.

'Of course, as a HGV driver, you had a large responsibility of driving competently and carefully. Your remorse and regret is heartfelt and genuine.'

Musik, of Leicester, East Midlands, was also banned from driving for five years.

After the case, Sergeant Carole Greaves, of the Major Collision and Enquiry Team at West Yorkshire Police, said: 'This case is another tragic reminder of what can happen when a motorist takes their eyes off the road. 

'It is vital that road users pay attention at all times as situations can change in a split-second.

'Musik pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity to causing this collision and the sentence he has received reflects that, but the consequences of his actions will stay with him for the rest of his life.'
