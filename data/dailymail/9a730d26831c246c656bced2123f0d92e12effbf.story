It’s official in America - men diagnosed with cancer are more likely to die from most types of the disease than women.

The difference in rates was due to a higher initial risk and later detection, according to a U.S. government study.

The National Cancer Institute study found the highest male-to-female mortality rate ratios were for mouth, larynx and hypopharynx cancers.

Hospital: Men diagnosed with cancer and more likely to die from the disease than women - due to a higher initial risk and later detection, an official study said

The study looked at a database of 36 different types of cancer from 1977 to 2006.

More than 5.5 men died from mouth cancer for every woman, 5.4 from cancer of the larynx and 4.5 for hypopharynx cancer, reported AFP.

For lung cancer, which is the leading cause of cancer deaths for both men and women, the research found 2.3 male deaths for each female death.

The main reason for the difference is that men are more at risk of developing cancer to begin with, the study's lead investigator said.

Michael Cook is an investigator in the division of cancer epidemiology and genetics at the National Cancer Institute.

The
average lifetime chance a man will develop lung cancer is about one in 
13, or one in 16 for a woman, the American Cancer Society says.

American men are more likely than women to have advanced disease by the time their cancer is diagnosed, Mr Cook said.

Waiting line: More than 5.5 men died from mouth cancer for every woman, 5.4 from cancer of the larynx and 4.5 for hypopharynx cancer, the study showed

He
said gender differences in exposure to carcinogens - including tobacco 
smoke and viral infections - play a role in the rate disparity.

‘Universal’ mechanisms, such as sex chromosomes and hormones, were cited and may contribute to observed sex differences in cancer incidence.

The NCI researchers said there was no single root cause for the disparity.

But influences include differences in behaviour of the tumour, cancer screening for people without symptoms and presence of other illnesses.

A recent survey conducted by Abbott Laboratories found that 28 per cent of men do not visit the doctor regularly.
