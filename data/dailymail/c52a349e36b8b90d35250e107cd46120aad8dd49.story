A Frenchman is suing Facebook under human rights laws for deleting his account after he posted a famous painting of nude woman as his profile picture.

The father-of-three used an image of an explicit 19th century oil by Gustave Coubet called The Origin Of The World on the social networking site.

But he claims he missed messages and 'social contact' from his 800 Facebook friends when the page was taken down on the eve of his birthday on February 27.

He has now launched legal action in a Paris court demanding the site pay him Â£18,000 in damages for barring his access.

The unnamed man's lawyer Stephane Cottineau said repeated emails to the California based company demanding the page be reinstated had also gone unanswered.

He added: 'This blind censorship and refusal to reply to emails suggests he is not worthy of their attention and is someone who has acted immorally or illegally.

'Deleting his account is a breach of his human rights, which guarantees my client's freedom of expression.

'It is also in breach of his rights as a consumer under French law.'

Facebook's rules state users 'will not post content that is hateful, threatening, or pornographic, or that incites violence, or contains nudity or graphic or gratuitous violence.'

The company has so far refused to comment on the legal action.

In February, Danish artist Frode Steinicke had his Facebook account deactivated for posting a copy of the same 1886 painting, which hangs in the prestigious Musee d'Orsay in Paris.

Facebook later reactivated his account on condition he only used pictures of clothed people on his page.

But a search on the site reveals several other accounts still feature the same Courbet painting.

Meanwhile, critics have now set up a Facebook group with 350 members condemning censorship of the painting 'and of art in general'.
