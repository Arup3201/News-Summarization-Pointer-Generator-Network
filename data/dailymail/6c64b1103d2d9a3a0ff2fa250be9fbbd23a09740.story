England suffered a humiliating eight-wicket defeat by New Zealand in their second match of the 2015 Cricket World Cup on Friday - undoubtedly one of the worst days in the history of English one-day cricket.

Here, Sportsmail looks back at some of the darkest days for England in the sport.

World Twenty20, Chittagong, March 31, 2014 - The Netherlands (133-5) beat England (88) by 45 runs 

England had endured a miserable winter after being whitewashed 5-0 in the Ashes Down Under. Things got no better in Bangladesh as England suffered defeat by minnows The Netherlands which brought an end to their tournament. 

The part-timers from the Netherlands made a strong start as they reached 84-1 after 11 overs before going on to set a target of 134 for England. 

The reply from England was abysmal. Ravi Bopara was the top scorer with just 18 runs as England were all out for 88, scoring just four fours throughout their innings. 

It equalled England's second lowest score in Twenty20 Internationals and summed up their winter.

Fifth Test, Sydney, January 5, 2014 - Australia (326 and 276) beat England (155 and 166) by 281 runs 

England arrived in Australia looking to retain the urn they had won just a few months earlier. By the time they took to the field of the Sydney Cricket Ground in January, the visitors were looking to avoid the whitewash. 

With England set a target of 448 to win on day three, it seemed unlikely. However, it was still humiliating for England to last just 31.4 overs as they could only muster 166 with Ryan Harris claiming 5 -25. 

It was an embarrassing end to one of Englands' worst ever Test series defeats and only the third whitewash in Ashes history.

World Cup, Chittagong, March 11, 2011 - Bangladesh (227-8) beat England (225) by two wickets 

After suffering a three-wicket defeat by Ireland in Bangalore nine days previously, England suffered another shock loss to Bangladesh in the group stage of the 2011 World Cup. 

England had hit a total of 225 and looked good for the victory as they reduced the hosts to 169-8. 

However, a stunning ninth-wicket partnership of 58 between Shafiul Islan amd Mahmudullah clinched victory with six balls to spare. 

England recovered with victory against the West Indies to progress but were knocked out by Sri Lanka in the quarter-finals.

World Twenty20, Lord's, June 5, 2009 - The Netherlands (163-6) beat England (162-5) by four wickets 

The opening match of the 2009 World Twenty20 for England on home soil ended in embarrassment as the Netherlands claimed victory off the final ball. 

England struggled to post a decent total, although would still have fancied their chances with the visitors chasing a target of 163. 

However, the Dutch well and truly went for it with Tom de Grooth scoring 49 off 30 balls. 

It came down to the last ball with the Netherlands looking for two runs. Bowler Stuart Broad had the chance for a run-out off the initial hit but missed and the Dutch ran through to claim a famous victory. 

England still qualified from Group D but were knocked out of the Super 8s stage with a defeat by the West Indies using the Duckworth- Lewis method.

First Test, Kingston, February 7, 2009 - West Indies (392) beat England (318 and 51) by an innings and 23 runs 

England captain Andrew Strauss was left shell-shocked after his side suffered humiliation on day four of the first Test in Kingston. 

After posting a first innings score of 318, West Indies replied with 392 to take a first innings lead of 74. 

What followed was staggering. England collapsed and were 26-7 before being bowled all out for 51, their third lowest Test innings total ever. 

It was enough for the West Indies to claim the five-Test series as the four remaining Tests were all drawn.

Second Test, Adelaide, December 5, 2006 - Australia (513 and 168-4) beat England (551-6 dec and 129) 

After a fourth day on which England had bowled Australia out for 513, a draw looked the most likely result. 24 hours later, England had somehow lost in what was described at the time by Shane Warne as the greatest victory of his Test career. 

England started day five on 59-1 but lost nine wickets for 60, with Warne taking 4-49, and the Aussies came out firing after tea in an attempt to chase the target of 168. 

Michael Hussey scored the winning runs with three overs to spare, finishing on a total of 61 not out, and the local crowd celebrated wildly as Australia took a 2-0 lead in the series.

England's first innings of 551 was the fourth-highest Test match total by a losing side and the visitors never recovered as they went on to suffer a whitewash.

Fourth Test, The Oval, August 22, 1999 - New Zealand (236 and 162) beat England (153 and 162) by 83 runs 

England were consigned to the bottom of the Wisden international rankings after suffering a 2-1 series defeat to New Zealand as the visitors clinched victory in the fourth and final test at The Oval. 

England's batting capitulated in the second innings as they chased a target of 246. The hosts had finished day three on 91-2 but could only muster 162 in the end, with Mike Atherton (64), Graham Thorpe (44) and Alec Stewart (12) the only English batsmen to score double figures. 

The last eight wickets were lost for just 39 runs as New Zealand celebrated only their second series triumph in England and captain Nasser Hussain was booed by his own fans on the Oval balcony.

Third Test, Trinidad, March 30, 1994 - West Indies (252 and 269) beat England (328 and 46) by 147 runs 

After losing the first two matches of the five-Test series, England - captained by Mike Atherton after Graham Gooch had resigned following the 1993 Ashes - arrived in Port of Spain for this must-win third Test. 

And this youthful side had a shot at it on day five as they were set a target of 194 to win. However, England collapsed in the face of the bowling attack from Curtly Ambrose who took 6-24. 

Alec Stewart was the only Englishman to make double figures with 18 and 'Extras' was the next-highest scorer with seven as England were bowled out for just 46, their second-lowest Test innings in history.

P.S. 

First Test, The Oval, August 29, 1882 - Australia (63 and 122) beat England by seven runs (101 and 77) 

This was the match which inspired the obituary mourning 'the death of English cricket' after a first defeat to Australia on home soil at The Oval. Australia bowled England all out for 77 in a tense finish, which reportedly caused one spectator to chew through the handle of his umbrella.
