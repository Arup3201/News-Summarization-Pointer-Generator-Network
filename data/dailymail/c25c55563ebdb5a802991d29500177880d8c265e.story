A British child was one of the victims of the Hong Kong ferry disaster, it emerged today.

The youngster was among 38 people killed when the pleasure cruiser Lamma IV collided with a passenger ferry on Monday night.

The cruiser, which was carrying partygoers to a fireworks show to celebrate China's national day, sank shortly after the crash while the ferry limped to shore.

More than 100 people were taken to hospital after some were thrown into the water from the party boat.

An FCO spokeswoman said: 'We can 
confirm that there was one British victim who died in the incident in 
Hong Kong and we are providing consular assistance to their family.'

Seven crew from the two vessels have been arrested on suspicion of endangering passengers by operating the craft unsafely.

Hong Kong authorities said five children died in the crash.

An official with the ferry company involved in the collision that killed 38 people said that the vessel recently passed inspection, but he had no details about how the crash occurred

The passengers on board the pleasure 
cruiser had gathered on the island of Lamma, around two miles south west
of Hong Kong island, to watch the fireworks display from the water, 
according to reports.

The majority of the 120 passengers were employees of Hong Kong Electric and their friends and family.

The company that owns the ferry involved said the vessel passed an inspection just last month.

The general manager of Hong Kong and Kowloon Holdings said the inspection of the Sea Smooth indicated no problems.

But Nelson Ng offered few details today about what caused the Monday night collision.

Police have arrested four crew members from the Sea Smooth and three from the Lamma IV on suspicion of operating their crafts unsafely.

The crash was Hong Kong's deadliest accident in more than 15 years and its worst maritime accident in more than 40.Mr Yuen denied the vessel was overloaded, saying it was carrying 121 passengers and three crew but had capacity for more than 200 passengers.

Chairman of HK Electric, Canning Fok Kin-ning, said the company has been contacting staff and their families since the tragedy happened last night, and has been accompanying victims and their family members in hospitals overnight to offer immediate assistance.

Mr Fok said: 'Cheung Kong Centre has already lowered Group flags to half mast to express the Groupâ€™s sorrow and condolences. A high level co-ordination team has been set up to co-ordinate the aftermath.'

Mr Fok added

tragedy.

Lamma is the third-biggest island in Hong Kong and near one of the coastal Chinese city's busiest shipping lanes.

The island is home to about 6,000 people, including many of the former British colony's expatriate workers. Thousands of Hong Kong residents live on such outlying islands.
