Bill Clinton thinks we might not be alone.

In an appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live on Wednesday, the former president said he wouldn't be surprised if we were visited by aliens one day.

'We know now we live in an ever-expanding
 universe,' Clinton told Kimmel. 'We know there are billions of stars and 
planets literally out there - and the universe is getting bigger.

Not alone: Bill Clinton appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live on Wednesday and said we might be visited by aliens one day as what we know about the universe suggests it could support extra-terrestrial life

Questions: He told Kimmel he had reviewed the Rosewell papers and sent staff to Area 51

'We 
know from our fancy telescopes that just in the last two years more than
 20 planets have been identified outside our solar system that seem to 
be far enough away from their suns - and dense enough - that they might 
be able to support some form of life.'

He added: 'So it makes it increasing less likely that we're alone.'

But when Kimmel pushed on whether there actually are aliens, Clinton responded: 'I'm trying to tell you I don't know.'

'But if we were 
visited some day, I wouldn't be surprised,' he added. 'I just hope that it's not 
like Independence Day, the movie - that it's, you know, a conflict.'

Clinton assured Kimmel that soon after he became president, he instructed his aides to research Area 51, the Nevada military facility, to make sure there were no aliens there.

The future? He said he hoped there wouldn't be a conflict, like in the movie Independence Day (pictured), if aliens did come to the Earth - but he also added that the situation could bring people together

He also had the Roswell papers - which detailed a reputed UFO sighting in 1947 - reviewed.

He said that while he had no evidence of aliens, he said that their existence could have surprising benefits for the world.

'It may be the only way to unite this increasingly divided world of oursâ€¦ think about all the differences among people of Earth would seem small if we feel threatened by a space invader,' Clinton said.

'That's the whole theory of Independence Day. Everybody gets together and makes nice.'
