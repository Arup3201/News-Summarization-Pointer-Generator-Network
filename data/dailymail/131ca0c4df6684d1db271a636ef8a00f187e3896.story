Two hungry young galaxies that collided 11 billion years ago are rapidly forming a massive galaxy about 10 times the size of the Milky Way, astronomers have discovered.

Researchers say the groundbreaking discovery is 'the equivalent of discovering a missing link between winged dinosaurs and early birds', and sheds new light on how the Universe formed.

The new mega-galaxy, dubbed HXMM01, 'is 
the brightest, most luminous and most gas-rich submillimeter-bright 
galaxy merger known,' the authors write in Nature.

The image at right shows a close-up view, with the merging galaxies circled. The red data are from the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory's Submillimeter Array (SMA) atop Mauna Kea, Hawaii, and show dust-enshrouded regions of star formation. The green data, taken by the National Radio Astronomy Observatory's Very Large Array (JVLA), near Socorro, New Mexico, show carbon monoxide gas in the galaxies. In addition, the blue shows starlight. A bridge of material connects the two galaxies, showing they are interacting. The blue blobs outside of the circle are galaxies located much closer to us

The galaxy pair was initially identified in the Herschel data as a single bright source, named HXMM01.

Follow-up observations showed that it
 is in fact two galaxies, each boasting a stellar mass equal to about 
100 billion Suns and an equivalent amount of gas.

The galaxies are linked by bridge of gas, indicating that they are merging.

Capturing the creation of this type of large, short-lived star body is extremely rare, the team said,

HXMM01 is fading away as fast as it forms, a victim of its own cataclysmic birth, the researchers say.

As the two parent galaxies smashed together, they gobbled up huge amounts of hydrogen, emptying that corner of the universe of the star-making gas.

'These galaxies entered a feeding frenzy that would quickly exhaust the food supply in the following hundreds of million years and lead to the new galaxy's slow starvation for the rest of its life,' said lead author Hai Fu of the University of California in Irvine.

'This monster system of interacting galaxies is the most efficient 
star-forming factory ever found in the Universe at a time when it was 
only 3 billion years old.

'Finding this type of galaxy is as 
important as the discovery of the archaeopteryx was in understanding 
dinosaurs' evolution into birds, because they were both caught at a 
critical transitional phase,' Fu said.

'The HXMM01 system is unusual not only because of its high mass and 
intense star-forming activity, but also because it exposes a crucial, 
intermediate step of the merging process, providing valuable insight 
that will help us constrain models for the formation and evolution of 
galaxies,' said co-author Asantha Cooray, also from University of 
California, Irvine.

The onset of the merger has sparked a star-formation frenzy, with the 
system spawning stars at a phenomenal rate equivalent to roughly 2000 
stars like the Sun every year.

By comparison, a galaxy like the Milky 
Way today only manages to produce the equivalent of one Sun-like star 
per year.

The discovery solves a riddle in understanding how giant elliptical galaxies developed quickly in the early universe and why they stopped producing stars soon after.

Other astronomers have theorized that giant black holes in the heart of the galaxies blew strong winds that expelled the gas.

But cosmologist Asantha Cooray, the UC Irvine team's leader, said that they and colleagues across the globe found definitive proof that cosmic mergers and the resulting highly efficient consumption of gas for stars are causing the quick burnout.
