A family who were planning a dream trip to Disneyland, Florida, were forced to scrap their holiday after US border officials got confused about a date.

Mark and Sally Fell hoped to take their son Max on the family trip after returning form a previous Disneyland holiday which they loved.

But when they booked the break with Thomson and applied for new online visas known as ESTAs (Electronic System for Travel Authorisation), their applications were rejected.

Mark and Sally Fell, with their son Max, who was due to accompany them on their trip to Disneyland, Florida .

US border control rejected the family's request on the grounds that Sally, 50, had 'overstayed' on her previous holiday.

When the family phoned the US Customs and Borders Protection agency they were told a computer had recorded she had overstayed for three months.

They eventually realised it had confused the different UK and US date formats and recorded her departure date as 11/8 - November 8 instead of 8/11 - August 11.

The family complained to Thomson but were told nothing could be done and they would not be issued with new ESTAs and had to cancel the holiday.

After a two year compensation battle they have finally received vouchers from Thomson to the £3,000 value of the flights they lost.

But Sally and civil engineer Mark, 52, say they are still £500 out of pocket because they have not been reimbursed for the accommodation bill.

Beauty therapist Sally said: 'With everybody we contacted to try and fix it we came across an attitude of 'it's your problem not ours'.

'We lost all the money on the flights and accommodation and spent hours of our own time sending emails and making calls without getting anywhere.

'What I can't believe is how long it took us to prove to people what date I travelled back. It is a black and white thing really and they didn't believe me.

'It is unbelievable really that we were able to get on a flight out of America without us even being recorded.'

She added: 'It is not really Thomson's fault but they didn't deal with the situation quickly and we lost our holiday.

'They are offering us free flights but it has cost us money and caused us a lot of unnecessary stress.

'They weren't interested in sorting out the problem despite it being on their flight using a company they contracted.'

The Fell family had previously been to Florida and wanted to return to Disneyland with their youngest son as they had enjoyed it so much

Mark and Sally took all their children - Ashleigh, 25, Jake, 23, and Max, 15 - to Disneyland, Orlando in 2012 and hoped to go back with Max the following summer.

They later found that hundreds of people had been affected by the glitch with Ultra Electronics - used by US Customs and Borders Protection - that occurred around October 2013.

Sally claims that Ultra Electronics notified the US Customs and Border Protection but the authorities refused to act on it for almost a year.

She added: 'Hundreds of other people were affected and we don't know why my husband and son didn't have the same problem.

'I think when it got to August 13th somebody must have realised there weren't 13 months in a year.'

But Sally, from Hertford, Herts. added that they only managed to achieve justice after an investigation by the BBC Rip Off Britain programme.

Thomson said a third-party company was responsible for the error.

Thomson has now paid out for the lost flights, but the Fells claim they are still out of pocket for the cancelled accommodation due to the mix-up

A spokesman said: 'We sympathise with the Fell family and understand their frustration and disappointment at not being able to travel to Florida.

'We did everything that we could to support the family.

'However, as Thomson has no influence over the operations of, or the decisions made by, the US Customs and Border Protection agency and the local departure control system provider, there was unfortunately nothing that we could do to enable the family to travel.'

He added: 'Whilst our terms and conditions do state that Thomson is unable to provide compensation for unused flights that result from the necessary documentation and authority for travel not being in place, and the original issue was unconnected to Thomson, we believe it is unfair that the Fell family is out of pocket as a result of an error at a third-party company.

'We have therefore offered them flights to Florida up to the value of the original flights purchased as a gesture of goodwill.

'We would like to reassure customers that this was an extremely rare situation and we understand the system issue has been resolved by the local departure control system provider.'
