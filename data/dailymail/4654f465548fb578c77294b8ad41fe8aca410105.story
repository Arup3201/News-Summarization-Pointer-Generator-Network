A Christmas card which openly mocks people living on council estates appears has been hastily withdrawn after just one day on sale after customers accused Clinton Cards of being prejudiced and insulting.

The 'Council Estate Christmas Card' was being sold online by the card company and was described as 'funny' and 'great for sending at Christmas time.' 

But the apparent humour was lost on dozens of customers who took offence at the card, which listed 'never actually been seen doing any work in his whole life' as a reason why Santa must live on a council estate. 

Clinton Cards has been accused of openly mocking people who live in council estates after it released a card listing reasons why Santa would live on an estate, including 'he has a record for breaking and entering' and 'He drinks alcohol during working hours.' The card, which was on sale for £2, has now been withdrawn

The £2 card featured Santa, a tower block and the words '10 reasons why Santa Claus must live on a council estate' on the front. 

Among the 'reasons' listed inside the card are: 'He can get hold of all the latest designer gear but never pays a penny for it!' and 'He has a record for breaking and entering.' 

The card was listed online on Saturday but was removed from sale on Sunday morning after a number of people complained about the offensive content. A weblink to the card now brings up an error page saying 'Whoops, our bad...'

A spokesman said the card had been 'immediately withdrawn' and it was a 'mistake' that it had ever been released for general sale.  

Darryl Birch, 32 and a computer programmer, saw the card online on Saturday evening. 

He said: 'I was appalled by it to be honest. It is degrading and offensive. I certainly won't be going to Clintons for my Christmas cards this year.'

Grandfather-of-two Paul Thornbury, 66, said: 'I have lived on a council estate most of my life.

'It's disgusting. It is one big stereotype. We are not like that. People shouldn't find this funny. It is tasteless.

The inside of the card lists the '10 reasons' why Santa could live on a council estate, which angered customers

The card was on sale on the Clinton Cards website, and was listed as 'great' for sending to people at Christmas

'My daughter told me about it. She was just as upset as I am. I imagine most people will feel this way really.'

But on the Mumsnet website opinion was divided, with one mother defending the card by saying: 'I live on a council estate and I absolutely love it.'

Another wrote 'I see tons of jokes about middle class/upper class people all the time, yet no one bats an eyelid.' 

A petition, signed by more than 100 people, has been launched on Change.org, calling for the card to be withdrawn immediately. It said: 'Christmas is a time for empathy and giving not judgement and vilification.'

Other people posted their 'disgust' at the card on Twitter, which also listed 'He uses various wild animals to pull his sleigh', as another 'council house characteristic' inside the card.

Medical politician Eric Rose wrote: 'I've seen some horrible Xmas cards but this one from Clinton cards is the worst. Please RT if u agree'.

Prospective MP for the Green Party for Bath, Somerset Dominic Tristram also tweeted: 'Justified outrage about this 'humour' from Clinton's Cards (@ClintonsTweet) on Twitter this evening. Appalling.' 

Customers posted comments about their reaction to the card on Twitter after it was seen on sale on Saturday 

 

Dozens of complaints were left on Facebook and Twitter accusing Clinton Cards of demonising working class

Patrick Hurley accused the card company of 'predjudice' and 'snobbery' while others claimed the company was promoting a 'hate-filled message.'

Suzanne Williams wrote: 'Live in social housing? Clinton Cards thinks you're a scrounger and a criminal.' 

'When did it become ok to laugh at people who live on council estates?' wrote Beverley Clack. 'This card from @ClintonsTweet plumbs new depths.' 

Customers also complained on the company's Facebook page. Belle Sebastian wrote: 'Disgraceful! 

'I live on a council estate - never have I been in trouble with the police, I don't drink, I worked full time for the council until I became very sick this year so I attend university whilst I recover.

'I cannot believe that your company has allowed this vile prejudice - I'm sure a number of your employees live on estates since you only pay minimum wage...'

The company's website lists job vacancies for Christmas temps in a number of locations with a salary of £4.96 to £6.50 per hour. 

The Living Wage Foundation say the current UK living wage is £7.85 an hour.

Kerry MacLeod wrote: 'I am appalled by Clinton's decision to demonize a certain section of our society. Clearly they lack awareness of why we have Council Housing and why people are unemployed or too sick to work. 

'I wonder how many of their own staff live in council housing or are on Housing Benefit or top up benefits because their wages are so low. This is shameful and disgraceful.' 

Clinton Cards said the card had been withdrawn immediately and apologised for any offence it had caused 

Other 'reasons' listed inside the card include: 'He only works once a year' and 'He drinks alcohol during working hours.' 

A spokesman for Clintons, which has 415 branches, said: 'A card in our range has been withdrawn immediately. It is in no way reflective of our views and we apologise without reservation.

'We are investigating how this offensive card got through our quality control procedures, which we will review and tighten as a result of this incident. 

'This was a mistake and we deeply regret the upset that this has clearly caused.'
