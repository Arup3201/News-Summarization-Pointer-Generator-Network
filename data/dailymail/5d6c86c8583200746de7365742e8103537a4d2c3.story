Diego Costa was once again amongst the thick of the action on Tuesday night as Jose Mourinho's side defeated Liverpool in extra-time to progress to the Capital One Cup final.

The former Atletico Madrid striker was persistently embroiled with the opposition players as the volatile cup tie threatened to boil over on several occasions.

Costa appeared to stamp on Emre Can in the first-half when retrieving the ball and again on Martin Skrtel in the second-half. Here is what Sportsmail's Graham Poll made of the key moments.

COSTA'S STAMP

Costa is confronted by Emre Can in the 12th minute after stamping on the Liverpool star's ankle.

POLL'S VERDICT: Costa should have been dismissed for the stamp. The question is will the FA charge Costa with violent conduct? To do so they have to check ref Michael Oliver didn't see it.

PENALTY KICK?

Martin Skrtel appears to bring down Costa in the area in the 23rd minute but Oliver gives a goal-kick. Sky pundit Thierry Henry said at half-time: 'Skrtel doesn't need to commit, the referee had a clear view and didn't give a penalty.'

POLL'S VERDICT: Jose Mourinho can have a Justifiable moan about the 'campaign' against Chelsea after Costa is clearly fouled by Skrtel. Oliver has a clear view but awards a goal-kick when it should have been a penalty.

HALF-TIME RAGE

Outraged by Oliver's decision not to award Costa a penalty, Mourinho confronted the referee in the tunnel at half-time and had to be shepherded away by fourth official Phil Dowd.

POLL'S VERDICT: If they did their jobs, the officials would report Mourinho. Managers are not allowed to do this.

SECOND STAMP 

Costa and Skrtel tangle again in the 54th minute. This time the Chelsea striker stamps on the defender's foot when the pair chase a loose ball and Skrtel retaliates by swinging his foot at Costa.

POLL'S VERDICT: I'd give Costa the benefit of the doubt as he was airborne and had to land somewhere. But both players should have been cautioned as they went head to head.

HEAD TO HEAD

Costa tussles with Steven Gerrard in the 12th minute of extra-time and puts his hand over the Liverpool captain's face. The pair go head to head and are both booked.

POLL'S VERDICT: Having decided not to caution Costa and Skrtel, he gave yellow cards to Costa and Gerrard when they repeated the head-to-head act.
