A teacher is in hospital after he was beaten in the head and face with a hammer during a carjacking carried out in front of his students.

Police are hunting for two masked men who battered Richard Knee, 41, in the car park at Kenilworth School and Sixth Form in Warwickshire yesterday afternoon.

The head of biology was attacked as he left school at 4pm by a gang who demanded his keys then started beating him in front of screaming students. 

Brutal: Biology teacher Richard Knee was beaten with a hammer by a masked gang who then stole his car in front of pupils at Kenilworth School and Sixth Form (pictured)

He was hit repeatedly in the face and left on the floor with serious head injuries before the gang sped off in his blue Ford Fiesta.

He was taken to Warwick Hospital where he was treated for his injuries, which were described as not being life-threatening.

 Mr Knee is today back recovering at his home in Leamington Spa after being released from hospital.

He said: ' I've just been told to rest up. I have a few cuts and bruises and a black eye but I am fine really.

'This is just the way of the world now sadly.

'It was quite scary at the time, they just wanted the car. I just hope the police can catch them.

'That's all I want to say about the matter.'

Headteacher Hayden Abbott said: 'The member of staff was assaulted by intruders and his car was stolen.

In shock: Students watched in horror as the popular teacher was beaten to the ground 

'The incident happened in the upper school car park outside of the perimeter gates and security fencing.

'This is clearly a very serious incident and we are liaising closely with the police.

'At the time of the incident the majority of the students had left the site but a small number were still in school involved in various activities.

'Some of the students witnessed the incident and were understandably upset..'

One 15-year-old pupil at the school added: 'Everybody is wishing him a very speedy recovery because he is so popular.

'I know somebody who saw it happen and it has really upset them, it must have been so scary. People were screaming. Everyone is signing a big card for him.'

Today police appealed for anyone with information or who witnessed the attack to get in contact with them.

A spokesman for Warwickshire Police said: 'Officers and staff from the Kenilworth Safer Neighbourhood Team (SNT) continue to engage with staff at the school, students and parents.

'They will be providing reassurance to the community with a greater presence in and around the school.

'Police are appealing for witnesses to the incident, or anyone who may have seen the blue Ford Fiesta BD14VPV or a dark coloured BMW that may have been in the area at the time.

'Anyone with information should contact police on 101.'

A spokesman for West Midlands Ambulance Service added: 'We attended an incident at just after 4 o'clock.

'We treated one patient for head injuries and he was taken to Warwick Hospital by ambulance.'

Investigation: Police are trying to trace the masked thugs who stole Mr Knee's Ford Fiesta

Since the attack, messages of support have flooded into social-networking websites.

Daryll Moreton wrote on Facebook: 'I live nearby and this is terrible, I hope the Teacher involved is okay, this is a first class School and no one wants to here this sort of thing happening to a teacher or anyone else looking after our kids.'

The comprehensive school, which caters for pupils aged 11-19, was rated outstanding by Ofsted in February last year.
