A five-year-old boy who's been diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumor who asked for just cards for his sixth birthday, which is today, has been sent 15,000 of them from well-wishers.

Danny Nickerson was diagnosed with a tumor last October. According to ABC News, doctors say that less than 10 per cent of children with the disease, called Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glimoma, live longer than 18 months.

Since he had to drop out of kindergarten, Danny's mother says he occasionally feels lonely - but he gets really excited to receive cards with his name on them.

Happy days: Danny's mother says he loves seeing cards with his name on them

Carley Nickerson says her son can identify his name, and when he saw it on packages at Easter, 'he was so happy.'

The Easter presents he received were from Magical Fairy Missions, an organization that sends mailings to children with brain tumors, as well as their siblings.

At this point, Danny is getting chemotherapy every two weeks, and despite the 18-month outlook, his mother remains optimistic.

'I don't really believe in that. He is doing great,' she said. 'Every day is a blessing.'

The Nickersons lives in Foxboro, a small town about 22 miles south of Boston. Besides Danny, Carley and Dan Nickerson have one other son, Matthew, who's four years old.

According to the Danny's Warriors Facebook page, an account Mrs Nickerson created to keep everyone updated on her son's progress, Danny was first diagnosed after he complained of having double vision.

Over the course of four days, Danny saw multiple doctors before finally getting an MRI.

'After the MRI, we were taken into a small room and given the worst news we have ever heard,' Mrs Nickerson said. 'Our lives fell apart, my heart felt like it exploded. There were no words to explain the pain that instantly hit my chest.'

'We are shocked and speechless,' Mrs Nickerson says of all the cards they've received. 'We opened about 200 of them... and he loved seeing them! One had a picture of a fat cat on it and another with a cat blowing out candles and he laughed so hard.'

Besides sending cards, there's another way to help Danny: His family has started a fundraising page on GoFundMe to help pay for his medical expenses.

Of the $15,000 the family was seeking, they've already raised $20,247 at the time of this article's publishing.

Let's shower him with cards! All Danny wanted for his sixth birthday: a box of cards
