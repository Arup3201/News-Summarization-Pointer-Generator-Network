A Buddhist monk has suffered serious injuries after setting himself on fire to protest against the slaughter of cattle.

Horrific: A Sri Lankan Buddhist monk set fire to himself outside the sacred Temple of the Tooth in Kandy, Sri Lanka today

The monk was brought to Colombo National Hospital in the capital with serious injuries.

Buddhism, Sri Lanka's state religion, opposes the killing of any life. Nearly 75 percent of Sri Lankans are Buddhists.

Many Buddhists in Sri Lanka do eat meat, but most avoid beef because they consider cows sacred.

In February, a Tibetan protester in 
monk's robes doused himself with gasoline, set himself ablaze and 
chanted anti-China slogans as he ran down a street in Nepal's capital.

His demonstration outside the Buddhist holy site, the Boudhanath stupa, was the latest in a string of self-immolations protesting China's rule over Tibet.

Witnesses in Nepal said the man entered a cafe in Kathmandu's Boudhanath district - home to many Tibetan Buddhist temples and monasteries - and asked to use the bathroom.

After spending some time there, he went onto the street and lit himself on fire. 

He ran a few steps, covered in flames 
and chanting slogans against China, before collapsing in front of the 
mammoth Boudhanath stupa, one of the holiest Buddhist sites in the 
world, surrounded by prayer wheels and decorated with colourful streams 
of prayer flags.
