For decades, residents in the Americas have been hunting for a mythical dog-like creature that sucks the blood from pets and livestock.

There have been various sightings of the so-called chupacabra since the mid-1990s, yet a resident in Texas claims he not only has spotted the elusive beast - he has proof it exists. 

A wild creature with a dog-like face and marked skin was been seen a total of three times around the Buffalo Bayou area, including in the back garden of resident Scott Black.

A wild creature with a dog-like face and marked skin, pictured, has been seen a total of three times around the Buffalo Bayou area in Texas by local resident Scott Black. Black believes it may be proof of the elusive, legendary creature the chupacabra

During an interview with local news channel KPRC, Black said: 'It had big long pointy ears, a long tail, had no fur and on its skin, and you could see splotches of grey.'

Black claimed he had most recently seen the creature in his back garden of his condo and took photos of what he believes to be a chupacabra through his window.

After seeing the photos, a trapper from Ohio has now placed cages in the area to try and catch it.

The chupacabra comes from the Spanish chupar ‘to suck’ and cabra, which means ‘goat’. It is a type of mythical creature, called a crytpid, that is said to roam parts of the Americas attacking and drinking the blood of goats.

Many local residents around the bayou, including wildlife experts, believe the animal is actually a coyote.

Yet pest controller Claude Griffin states the physical characteristics of the animal are a mix of different canine breeds including coyotes, dingos and domestic dogs.

Griffin said that a number of Houston residents breed different canines before releasing them into the wild, and believes that this latest creature may simply be a result of this inbreeding.

He added that regardless what the creature is, it doesn't look 'friendly' and has warned the neighbourhood to keep pets and small children indoors until the animal is caught.

It is the third sighting of the creature in the Buffalo Bayou area in the past fortnight.

The first ever sightings of the legendary 
animals were in Puerto Rico in 1995.

Reports at the time claimed to have seen a creature the size of a
 small bear with spines along its back, a long tail and distinctive 
marks on its bare skin. 

The myth, in particular, began after a 
number of sheep were found in Puerto Rico and Mexico, with puncture 
wounds, and drained of blood.

Reports of evil, dog-style animals then began circulating and residents blamed these creatures for the deaths of the sheep. 

In

 all wild dogs whose fur has been scratched off because of mites.
