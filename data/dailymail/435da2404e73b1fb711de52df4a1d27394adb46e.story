The number of homeless Romanians in London has nearly trebled in a year, it was reported today.

Some 490 people from the country were seen sleeping rough in the capital’s streets or parks from June to September last year - a sharp increase from the 173 observed in the final quarter of 2013.

The figures from the Greater London Authority’s Chain database reveal the rise since European Union restrictions on migration to Britain from Romania were lifted in January 2014.

Alp Mehmet, from campaign group MigrationWatch, told The Sunday Telegraph: ‘This backs up everything we have said about the rise in Romanian arrivals since the lifting of the restrictions.

‘The requirement that migrants, including EU migrants, must be able to support themselves remains in force and should be enforced.’

The figures in a report by journalist Andrew Gilligan included the dozens of Roma beggars known to congregate at Marble Arch, but also show 70 Romanians now sleep rough in the borough of Brent.

In addition, they reveal that nearly a fifth of homeless people in London are now Romanian - and the number of Romanian rough sleepers in outer London is up 600 per cent since the end of 2013.

The report follows a Mail on Sunday article last June quoting Westminster Council figures that showed the number of homeless Romanians in central London had tripled from January to May.

And last month the newspaper reported how a police notice deterring pickpockets had gone up outside the busy Covent Garden London Underground station - written in Romanian.

Meanwhile last October MailOnline reported how a 40-strong group of Romanian beggars sleeping rough under Park Lane in central London demanded: 'We're EU citizens, give us houses'.

EU migrants can claim a council house in certain circumstances, but Westminster Council says the problem of the Park Lane camps is currently costing the taxpayer £500,000 a year.

Complaints from local residents and businesses include reports of Eastern European gangs begging, washing in fountains, dumping rubbish and defecating in public.

Staying in London: European Union restrictions on migration to Britain from Romania were lifted last January

Last year politicians dismissed predictions that there would be a fresh wave of immigration when Bulgarians and Romanians were given unrestricted rights to work in the UK in January 2014.

In May, Treasury Chief Secretary Danny Alexander called warnings of a rise in Eastern European migration ‘inflammatory rhetoric’ and ‘scaremongering’.

His comments came in response to figures showing the number of Bulgarians and Romanians working in the UK had fallen by 4,000 in the three months since employment restrictions were lifted.

But the Daily Mail reported last week how more than a quarter of a million Romanian and Bulgarian nationals now live in Britain – a figure up by almost 50,000 in the past 12 months.

The number based here has increased more than fivefold in eight years. Data now shows about one in five working-age migrants from Romania and Bulgaria are not in work – a total of 46,000.
