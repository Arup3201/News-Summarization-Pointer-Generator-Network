A four-year-old girl was left screaming in pain after biting on a sharp metal spring which was lurking in her Cadbury’s ice cream.

Cherish Allen, 22, bought the pack of four Dairy Milk Caramel ice creams from her local Farm Foods store in Bell Green, Coventry as a treat for her children.

Aurora, four, and her brother Tobias, two, started tucking into the ice creams as they walked home from a day out with Ms Allen and her partner Roy Smith, 31.

But Aurora suddenly started screaming in pain - after choking on the hidden metal spring.

Ms Allen said: 'I used my instincts and checked her mouth. I spotted something shiny and fished it out of her mouth. It was a spring.

'I checked her hand and the ball bearing was in the very bottom of the ice cream. She choked slightly and started screaming so I think she tried to swallow it.

'Aurora was very upset. She wouldn’t eat her dinner because she kept saying the food would hurt her mouth.'

Ms Allen said the consequences could have much worse, especially if she had instead given that ice cream to her younger son.

She said: 'I was horrified, it is not what you expect from a little treat is it? I mean it could have been my two-year-old son. He might not have realised it shouldn’t have been there.

Aurora's mother Cherish Allen, 22, said the ball baring of the spring was found at
 the bottom of the cone and left her daughter screaming in pain

Ms Allen and her partner Roy Smith, 31, were walking along the street with their two children when the incident unfolded

'The consequences could have been catastrophic. God knows what could have happened. I felt sick.

Ms Allen, a full-time mother, said she also took Tobias' ice cream from him incase it was also dangerous.

R & R Ice Cream, which produce the product, said the find was 'rather disturbing'

She said: 'I took Tobias’s ice cream from him and he had such a tantrum because he didn’t understand.

'My partner Roy was mortified but he is glad Aurora is ok. I am livid that better measures are not taken to ensure this doesn’t happen.

'A stray bit of paper, a strand of hair you can understand, even if it is still disgusting, but not something potentially life threatening.

'You just don’t expect it, especially from such a massive well known company like Cadbury’s.'

The couple have kept the spring in a tub until the matter has been investigated.

A spokesperson from R & R Ice Cream, which produce Cadbury’s ice creams, said: 'Obviously if she has found a spring or a piece of metal than that really is rather disturbing as things like that should not get into the product.

'We do take a huge amount of care to ensure things like this do not get into the product and all products have to be passed through a metal detector.

'We will make sure the incident is fully investigated.'
