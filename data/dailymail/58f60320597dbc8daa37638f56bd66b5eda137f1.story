Roy Hodgson claimed Liverpool's poor start to the season was behind Raheem Sterling's decision to pull out of England's starting line-up against Estonia.

Sterling was dropped to the bench and replaced by Adam Lallana in England's 1-0 victory over Estonia after admitting he wasn't mentally ready to start the Euro 2016 qualifier.

The Liverpool forward, still only 19, came off the bench to win the 74th minute free-kick that led to England skipper Wayne Rooney scoring his 43rd goal for his country.

Hodgson said: 'There is an awful lot going on in his head. Perhaps it's quite simply the season hasn't started quite as well for Liverpool as they wanted.

'He's player who's always in the focus and spotlight for England and Liverpool, maybe that's had some effect. But I don't know, it's a theory.

'In mitigation of a young player, when you break into a team like Liverpool and you have a fantastic season, then you go to the World Cup and you do well and people regard you as one of the few who lived up to his reputation.

'Then you come back and you're still only 19 years of age, there are a lot of other things that play a part it people's make up. It isn't quite as simple as the training you're doing maybe taking some juice from your legs.'

Hodgson claimed Sterling is one of the biggest talents in English football after the World Cup, but the decision to withdraw him from the team to start in Tallinn is highly unusual.

Sterling played just 45 minutes of England's 5-0 victory over San Marino at Wembley on Thursday night and Hodgson claimed at the time that he looked to the head coach in the dressing room to say 'why me?'.

Less than 48 hours later Hodgson revealed that Sterling approached him after a warm up at London Colney on Saturday morning to tell him that he was not in the right mental state to play.

Hodgson said: 'People don't like it when you simplistically tell the truth. We were training at The Grove doing a light session but some work in how we wanted to play the game tactically. 

'Just before we started, Raheem had done the warm up and he came to me and said ''look I really am feeling a bit tired, I'm not in my best form at the moment because I am feeling a bit tired''.

'So I said best thing is Adam Lallana starts the game and you rest and I have got you to bring on from the bench, simple as that.

'As you saw when he came on there is nothing wrong with him and he isn't suffering from anything.

'It was a question of having two players, who both did pretty well against San Marino and one is telling me he is a bit tired and jaded, the other one is full of beans.

'We'll put the one on who is full of beans and keep the other one up your sleeve.

'I think it would be wrong of players to try to fool me into think they are ready and that they're 100 per cent when they aren't because they are robbing somebody else of an opportunity. I thought Lallana had a good game.'

Sterling came on and made an impression, but the expectation of the youngster is high

After the San Marino game, Hodgson claimed that the Liverpool forward had been at his best on the night and that there was no cause for concern.

That had changed by the time he explained the decision to leave Sterling on the bench until the 63rd minute, when he came on to replace Jordan Henderson.

Hodgson added: 'Don't forget it was two days after quite a difficult game against San Marino. It was two days after the game. 

'It was fatigue he hadn't managed to shake off after the San Marino game, it was no more complicated than that. Is it common? I don't really know.

'At international level, when there are so many good players trying to get their hands on the shirt, I don't think you should keep hold of it when maybe you are feeling yourself that you're not at your best.

'We have to take players' welfare into consideration and there are times when top league teams with Champions League football when players suffer from a physical and mental fatigue.' 

Hodgson has a good working relationship with Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers, but these claims will create tension when Sterling returns to Melwood on Monday.

Sterling is one of Liverpool's best players and it will be down to Rodgers to make sure the forward is in the right frame of mind to face his former side QPR on Sunday.

Hodgson added: 'I don't want to say any more, I don't want to get drawn. If you really want to research that further you've got to speak to him, people who work with him and his club. It was a simple decision. 

'It was good to have him up our sleeve to put on in the last 25 mins and I'm convinced he'll have a week now, exactly a week, I'm pretty sure when he goes back to Liverpool they'll sort him out and come Sunday you'll see him flying around.'
