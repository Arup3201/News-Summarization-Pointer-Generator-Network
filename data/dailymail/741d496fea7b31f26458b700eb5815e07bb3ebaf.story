With every battered line, scrape and knock, each coin has been rendered as individual as the many thousands of hands they have passed through.

Now, as governments across the world debate whether to do away with their lowest value coins, one photographer is on a mission to save as many pennies as he can before they are consigned forever to history,

Photographer Martin John Callanan is busy working on a photo project
entitled The Fundamental Units - a series of extremely large 
prints showing the lowest value coins of countries around the world.

He has teamed up with National Physical 
Laboratory in Teddington, to use 'Europe’s
best microscope' to show each coin in all its worn charm.

A Chilean peso. Each coin is photographed with 4,000 individual tiny exposures, and it takes three days to expose the images

Each coin is photographed with 4,000 individual tiny exposures, and it takes three days of processing to turn the individual photos into a single composite photograph weighing 400 megapixels.

Printed out, each photo measures 1.2 and 1.2 meters (~3.9 square feet).

The resulting photographs are meant to shown the 'materiality of the coins and all the wear, tear, damage and corrosion.'

Pau Waelder, Curator of the y Horrach Moyà Gallery,  said: 'The economic system, which has raised to such notorious prominence in recent years because of its obvious impact on our lives, is a complex structure whose functioning is increasingly necessary to understand and, as much as possible, to predict or even control.

The Burmese Pya. There are many precedents for scrapping small coins. The US abolished the half-cent in 1857 and the UK's halfpenny was withdrawn in 1984

The lowest denomination Australian coin. New Zealand and Australia abandoned the one-cent and two-cent coin in the 1990s

'In this sense, and in response to 
the dominance of macroeconomics in the discourse of the media, the 
artist chooses a microscopic view of the world economy.

'The Fundamental Units, a series that
begins with the works produced by Horrach Moyà Gallery for this 
exhibition, is an exploration of the lowest denomination coins from the 
world’s currencies using an infinite focus 3D optical microscope at the 
National Physical Laboratory in Teddington.'

'The images obtained with the 
microscope have been combined to form an extremely detailed large scale 
reproduction of the least valuable coins from Australia, Chile, the 
Euro, Myanmar and the Kingdom of Swaziland.

'In these images the humble metal acquires a planetary dimension and is displayed as the atoms that shape the global economy.'

The Fundamental Units was produced by Horrach Moyà Gallery

There are many precedents for scrapping small coins.

In America, the half-cent was abolished in 1857, and in 1984 the UK's halfpenny was withdrawn.

New Zealand and Australia abandoned the one-cent and two-cent coin in the 1990s.

Campaigners in the US and UK also 
want the penny and cent coins to be consigned to history, because 
nothing can be bought with a one-cent or one-penny coin.
