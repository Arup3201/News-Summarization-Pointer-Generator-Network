Harvey Edgington, head of film and locations at the National Trust, said he expects a significant increase in the number of visitors to the houses and castles features in the series.

He told The Times: 'I'd love to do double, but I think 20 to 25 per cent is more likely. They are all within a short distance and you could feasibly do the whole trail in a weekend.' 

One of the stops will be the small courtyard at Chastleton House, a Jacobean country property in Oxfordshire, which has been used to portray the dramatic scenes from Cromwell’s childhood in Putney in the series.

According to the National Trust, it represents an ‘exceptionally well-preserved time capsule’, as the original wealthy owner’s descendants lost their wealth and could not afford its upkeep.
