Former Prime Minister Tony Blair helped set up a deal which could allow the Qatari Royal Family to own 50 per cent of a landmark London hotel group, a court heard today.

It was claimed Mr Blair had asked a Government minister in 2010 to lobby on behalf of Irish investor Patrick McKillen in his bid to stop Irish company Coroin's £660million debt falling into the hands of the Irish government's agency for toxic debt, Nama.

Blair personally persuaded the ruler of Qatar to contact Irish investor Patrick McKillen and his bid to gain control of the £1billion hotel company, which owns Claridge's, the Berkeley and the Connaught.

Shortly after the two 'great friends' met in Doha, the Emir of Qatar Sheikh Hamad asked his son Sheikh Jassim to contact Mr McKillen in London to arrange the deal, the High Court was told.

Mr Blair acted as something of a peace broker after Mr McKillen and the Qataris fell out over a failed deal to buy the hotels a year ago.

Mr Blair and his company Tony Blair Associates then acted as an 'honest broker' between the McKillen camp and the Qataris in a £70million deal to take a controlling stake in Coroin.

The deal will come to fruition if Mr McKillen wins his High Court battle with billionaire twins the Barclay brothers.

Mr McKillen claims the brothers unlawfully prevented him buying a crucial stake in the company.

Property
 developer Patrick McKillen  admitted deleting hundreds of messages
 which could have related to an on-going court case. 
  Mr McKillen and billionaire twins the 
Barclay brothers are locked in a legal battle at London's High Court 
over the ownership of a landmark £1billion hotel group. 
  The property developer admitted wiping
 his outbox earlier this year of hundreds of messages, but he denied the
 messages had any relation to the trial. 
  Kenneth Maclean QC, for the Barclay 
brothers' company, claimed the developer had deleted the messages to 
keep a £70 million deal he had made with the Qatari royal family to buy 
back shares in the hotel company. 
  And Mr McKillen told the court he had 'concerns' the Barclays or their agents were hacking his Irish mobile phone. 
  Mr McKillen claimed the brothers had 
hired private detectives to follow him out of restaurants and had 
attempted to find his American social security number. 
  However, he admitted he had no 
evidence Barclay's or their interests had hacked his phone but said he 
was 'very concerned' because they would 'stop at nothing'. 
  Mr McKillen claims the Barclays acted 
unlawfully when they denied him an opportunity to buy a stake in Coroin 
owned by financier Derek Quinlan. 
  Giving evidence to Justice David 
Richards, Mr McKillen claimed he would have done anything in 'his power' 
to increase his 36 per cent stake in the company and stop the Barclay 
brothers from completing their 'hostile takeover'. 
  The Barclay brothers and their associated companies deny the allegations. 
  The case continues.

The High Court in London was told investor Mr McKillen first met Mr Blair at an economic meeting in Davos while he was still Prime Minister.

The pair re-kindled their relationship through PR guru Matthew Freud in early 2010 when Mr McKillen and hotel company Coroin, in which he was an investor, was about to be tied into the Irish government agency for bad debt.

Mr Blair was enlisted to 'give advice' to stop the company's debt falling into the Irish government's agency.

But in an email sent by Tony Blair Associates executive Varun Chandra in January 2010, Mr Blair suggested sitting government City Minister Lord Paul Myners lobby influential people in Ireland to stop the debt falling into Nama.

The relationship with Tony Blair Associates continued throughout 2011 and Mr McKillen would meet consultants for 'ongoing chats, every week or so we had a coffee.'

But it was Mr Blair himself, who during a business meeting in Doha with Sheikh Hamad, suggested the groups should form a partnership.

Giving evidence today, Mr McKillen said Sheikh Jassim contacted him out of the blue in February 14 suggesting they met in the lobby in Claridge's to discuss a deal.

Mr McKillen said: 'During the meeting Sheik Jassim said that Tony Blair and his father had been doing business in Doha and the issue of Maybourne came up.

'Tony Blair had suggested that they should make contact with Paddy McKillen. Tony understood that there was no progress and Sheik Hamad contacted his son who was in London and suggested contact with me should be made.'

Mr McKillen denied the Qatari deal was done by Mr Blair acting as his agent.

He said: 'No, it came purely from a discussion in Doha between an ex head of state and head of state. I'm not sure what business they were doing but the two gentlemen are very close. I felt that Mr Blair's office would smooth any issues.'

Barrister for the Barclay brothers Kenneth Maclean questioned if Mr Blair or his office had sought payment for his role in the deal.

But Mr McKillen said he had never thought about paying Mr Blair or his office and agreed Mr Blair was acting out of the 'goodness of his heart'.

Mr McKillen said: 'Maybe he was playing the bigger picture with the Qataris but Tony Blair genuinely wanted a resolution for the hotel group he had a personal anxiety to get a resolution for the hotels.'

The trial continues.
