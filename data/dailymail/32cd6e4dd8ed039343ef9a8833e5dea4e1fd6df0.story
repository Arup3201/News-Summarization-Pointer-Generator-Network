The policeman who shot dead a black teenager in St Louis decided to stay with the Ferguson police department because he liked the people in the neighbourhood, a friend who has known him for 12 years has claimed.

Jay, who declined to give his surname, said that Darren Wilson preferred to patrol the African American neighbourhood of St Louis, Missouri rather than work a whiter area with lower crime.

He claimed the 28-year-old officer was not a racist and was a level-headed person who ‘always made the right decisions’.

Jay spoke out as MailOnline obtained a picture of Wilson when he was just 16 - two years younger than Michael Brown, who he is accused of shooting dead last Saturday.

The photo shows Wilson as a sophomore at St Charles West High School in St Charles, a suburb of St Louis, Missouri, where he grew up.

Wilson is now at the centre of a story which has torn apart St Louis and sparked six nights of unrest and rioting.

Missouri Governor Jay Nixon has now imposed a curfew and declared a state of emergency as tensions remain high.

MailOnline spoke to Jay, 28, who checks for underground utility lines for a living, after tracking him down through a friend who also knew Wilson.

In the longest conversation so far with somebody who is close to the officer, Jay said that he met his friend playing hockey on the street in St Charles.

They became close and used to ‘do typical guy stuff’ together like sit around and watch football. They two friends also joined a bowling league team together.

Jay said: ‘He’s a really classy guy. He’s the last person you would expect to do something like this.

‘We met 12 years ago and we’ve become really good friends since then.

‘He’s got a lot of friends round here. He’s a quiet guy.

‘I know that if he was in danger he is not the type of guy to do something stupid.

‘I just can’t see it happening. I can’t see him doing it.’

Jay said that Wilson signed up to join the police when he thought about it and then backed out, but Wilson was interested and took his place.

Jay said: ‘He loved the job. He loved being a cop. He liked to help people so I think that’s why he signed up’.

Jay said that Wilson would ‘do anything for anybody’ and once co-signed for a car with him because he had bad credit.

He said: ‘I have never seen him in a bad situation. At all times he keeps himself out of bad situations. He always makes the right decisions.’

At the age of 22 Wilson signed up with the police in Jennings, a neighbourhood close to Ferguson. He appears to have transferred to Ferguson two years later.

In February he received a commendation for ‘extraordinary effort in the line of duty’. His father John posted a picture on Facebook and wrote next to it: ‘Very proud of my son’.

Asked if Wilson had ever appeared racist, Jay said: ‘Not at all. I know he told me many times that he liked working out in Ferguson and Jennings.

‘People used to ask him why don’t you move to a safer area but he liked it out there. He didn’t mind being on the (housing) estate…

‘...he liked the people out there. He liked the people he worked with. As far as I know he never had any trouble’.

MailOnline has already established that Wilson came from a troubled home and neighbours claimed his mother Tonya Durso cheated them out of hundreds of thousands of dollars by stealing their identities.

She died at the age of 35 in 2002 when Wilson would have been just 16, the year his sophomore photo was taken.

Wilson now lives in Crestwood, a quiet middle class and almost entirely white suburb of St Louis in a ranch style house with a pool out the back.

According to public records he got divorced last year and moved into his current home with his new girlfriend.

Others coming to Wilson’s defence in recent days have been Jake Shepard, who went to school with him.

He wrote on Facebook: ‘He is the nicest guy in the world! He Has the biggest heart. He really does. Nobody is ever going to know what really happened, but I can say with certainty that the officers intentions were pure.

‘He is one of those cops that make you appreciate law enforcement.’
