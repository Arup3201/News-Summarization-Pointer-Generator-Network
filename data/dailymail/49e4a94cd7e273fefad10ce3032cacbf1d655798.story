A new management team has finally been appointed at Silverstone, ending months of uncertainty behind the scenes.

In October, Richard Phillips, Ed Brookes and David Thompson were suspended on full pay from their positions as managing director, financial director and legal director respectively pending an undisclosed internal investigation.

Silverstone has plans to enlarge the business after appointing a new management team

It resulted in British Racing Drivers' Club (BRDC) chairman John Grant and director Lawrence Tomlinson taking up the role of joint-acting chief executive of Silverstone Circuits Limited (SCL).

The BRDC made clear at the time the suspensions were coincidental to the plans of Grant and Lawrence into the restructuring of the Silverstone business.

The BRDC has now appointed Patrick Allen as managing director given his experience in sales and marketing, supported by Stuart Pringle, who has taken on the new position of sporting director.

Securing future of the British F1 Grand Prix was pivotal to plans for famous track

Pringle will oversee the event management and circuit operations side of the business.

Commenting on his vision for the circuit, Allen said 'Silverstone has great potential to become the ultimate entertainment venue, and with the support of the team I believe we can make it the place to go.

'I want our customers to know they can visit the circuit any weekend of the year and be guaranteed an amazing value-for-money experience, whether that is to watch motor racing, visit a music concert, enjoy a food festival or attend an exhibition.'

Phillips, Brookes and Thomson have now left SCL.

Commenting on their time at the helm, Grant said: 'This executive team has overseen significant growth and diversification of Silverstone's business during its tenure, during which the Wing was built and the future of the British F1 Grand Prix secured.

'I would like to thank them for their contributions to Silverstone and wish them well for the future.'
