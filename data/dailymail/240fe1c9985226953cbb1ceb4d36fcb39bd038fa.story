Fast food lovers need never suffer the dilemma of whether to order a pizza or burger again as a restaurant chain in Japan unveils a hybrid of the two, dubbed the Megaburgerpizza.

The experimental dish was created by pizza place Pizza Little Party and weighs in at 1.2kg.

It is made of 400g grilled beef burger patties with gherkin pickles, onions and a special cheese blend seasoned with meat sauce, ketchup and mustard.

Megaburgerpizza is anything but Little, and is sold only at the Japanese pizza chain Pizza Little Party

This is all sandwiched between two 11 inch pizza crusts as buns, with the pizza sauce and cheese you'd expect from a pizza.

The Megaburgerpizza is being sold at the Pizza Little Party Kyoto pizzeria chain for about £17 each (￥2,580).

It is being rolled out for a limited 
time only, available from September 1 until November 22 - or you can 
get it home-delivered straight to your door.

Back in 2010 Burger King rolled out a burger pizza hybrid for £8, dubbed the NY Pizza Burger.

The limited edition meal came in at a whopping 2,500 calories and four times the size of a regular burger.

Pizza Little Party will sell the £17 Megaburgerpizza from September 1 to November 22

If you can't decide what to get, pizza chains in Japan are offering giant pizza burger hybrids

An oversized Whopper patty was sandwiched between a nine-and-a-half inch sesame bun.

Canadian food chain Boston Pizza later also rolled out a limited edition of a pizza burger hybrid, the Pizza Burger. This was more like a burger calzone and came in two varieties; pepperoni and bacon, and five-cheese. 

The Pizza Little Party's Megaburgerpizza is the latest - and biggest - hybrid of its kind.
