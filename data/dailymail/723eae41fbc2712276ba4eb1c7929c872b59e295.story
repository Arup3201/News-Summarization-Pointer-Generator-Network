Ben Davies, 29, a former director of First Asset Management, the company thought to be at the centre of City of London police investigations

Barclays has promised compensation to thousands of customers whose confidential files were stolen and sold to rogue City traders.

The bank has set up a dedicated team to deal with the fallout from the huge data loss and is ‘making progress’ in the hunt for the thief.

At the same time, City of London police have launched an investigation after being contacted by the whistleblower who exposed the leak in last week’s Mail on Sunday.

The plundered details of up to 27,000 accounts – including customers’ earnings, savings, health issues and insurance policies – are worth millions to investment sharks.

Barclays would not be drawn on whether the final compensation bill would run into millions, but a spokesman said: ‘In all cases we will be making a gesture of goodwill.’

Detectives are understood to be focusing their inquiries on one firm in particular, City-based First Asset Management (FAM), which closed down suddenly last September amid complaints from angry investors.

FAM’s details are included on a memory stick containing the files of 2,000 customers. One of its former directors is 29-year-old Ben Davies, who was disqualified as a director for 11 years last July.

However he retained close links to the firm.

Sources say he continued to pay the rent and ‘turned up at the offices every day’. When contacted by this newspaper, Mr Davies, who lives in White City, West London, insisted he knew nothing about the stolen data.

Barclays will offer all customers affected by the breach compensation after sensitive details were leaked

A retired sales manager from the Wirral, who asked not to be named, told how he lost £40,000 with FAM.

How the Mail on Sunday broke the story

The 82-year-old said: ‘I strongly suspect I am one of those caught in this scam. The fraud fits my situation so perfectly.

‘I have suffered sleepless nights and had to go to my doctor for medication. There has been a huge human cost. My wife and I have been through two years of purgatory.’

He has been a Barclays customer since he was 20 and in December 2009 sought investment advice.

In 2012 he was contacted by a trader from FAM who persuaded him to invest in rare metals.

‘The metals were supposed to be held in a bonded warehouse in my name. Where? I don’t know. I don’t know why I didn’t ask. I was simply going to ring up and get my money, and that was it.’

However his calls to the firm went unanswered last September. Police are investigating.

Meanwhile it was reported this weekend that Barclays has begun a search to replace its chairman Sir David Walker, 74, who took over in 2012 in the wake of the Libor scandal. Barclays declined to comment.
