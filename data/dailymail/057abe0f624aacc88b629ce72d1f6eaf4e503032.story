Rude and disruptive pupils are wrecking four in every ten lessons that take place in English secondary schools, a major international survey has revealed.

Students were also found to have verbally abused and intimidated teachers more often than nearly all other countries in the study.

Standards of behaviour were found to be ‘notably better’ in private schools than the state system, with a third of state school heads telling researchers they needed tougher powers to tackle poor behaviour effectively.

Survey laid bare the extent to which poor discipline disrupts learning. Teachers in England spend an average of seven minutes in every hour-long lesson keeping order, instead of teaching. Picture posed by models.

The study by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development questioned more than 100,000 teachers across 34 countries on aspects of their work including working hours, job satisfaction, pay and classroom environment.

Heads reported that serious offences such as physical attacks, drug and alcohol abuse, vandalism and theft happened only ‘rarely’.

But the survey laid bare the extent to which poor discipline disrupts learning, with an in-depth report on the findings by the Institute of Education concluding that the classroom environment was ‘far from ideal’ in a ‘substantial minority’ of lessons.

Teachers in England spend an average of seven minutes in every hour-long lesson keeping order, instead of teaching.

Overall 11.4 per cent of lesson time was lost due to bad behaviour. In Poland, the figure was only 8.5 per cent.

Separately the research showed that ‘intimidation or verbal abuse of teachers’ was widespread in England, with 6.5 per cent of heads reporting it was a weekly occurrence. This was twice the international average and the fifth highest in the world.

In other findings, teachers in England taught the most children classed as having special educational needs, with 66.5 per cent reporting more than one in ten of their pupils had some form of additional need. The figure is significantly higher than the international average of 25.5 per cent.

Teachers are more likely to take sick days in England than most other countries, the survey by the OECD found.

Some 11 per cent of heads complained of weekly instances of ‘unjustified absenteeism’ by their staff. 

Levels were the ninth highest in the world, and more than double the 4.7 per cent international average.In their defence, teachers might argue they work some of the longest hours in the world. 

A typical working week involves 48 to 52 hours’ work, with one in ten putting in 65 hours a week or more.Yet only about a third of this time is spent actually teaching pupils. 

Around 20 hours are spent in the classroom, with lesson preparation, marking and other admin taking up the rest of their time.

Twenty-eight per cent of teachers said that at least one in ten of their pupils spoke English as a second language – above the international average of 21.3 per cent.

However, teachers in England are among the least experienced in the world, with an average track record of just 12.4 years.

And they believe they are ‘undervalued’ by the public despite working longer hours than their counterparts in most other countries.

A spokesman for the Department for Education said: ‘We have taken decisive action to give teachers the powers they need to tackle poor behaviour and discipline, which have improved significantly in recent years.

‘We scrapped no touch rules that stopped teachers removing disruptive pupils from classrooms without fear of being sued and have given them powers to search pupils for banned items.

‘We have also brought back no-notice, same-day detentions and made clear that tough but proportionate sanctions such as writing lines, clearing up after meal times and litter picking are perfectly valid punishments.’
