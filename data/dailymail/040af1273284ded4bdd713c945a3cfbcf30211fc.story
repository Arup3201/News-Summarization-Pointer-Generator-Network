Cleveland house of horrors survivor Michelle Knight revealed today how her captor Ariel Castro would keep her and the other women locked in an upstairs room when guests would come to visit - blocking them in with piles of furniture.

Using a model reconstruction of the Ohio home, the 33-year-old, who has changed her name to Lily Rose Lee, explained how Castro 'would take speakers, a couch, chairs and block anyone from getting up the stairs at all'.

As the one-year anniversary of her miraculous escape approaches, Miss Knight, who spent more than a decade locked up, revealed that she has moved into her own apartment and started cooking classes as she dreams of becoming a chef.

She told Today: 'Sometimes in life you have a dark past that makes you who you are but doesn't define who you are.'

The 33-year-old is now known as Lily Rose Lee, a
 name she picked after her favorite flower. She explained her decision, saying: 'I felt like every brand new start needs new beginnings.'

She escaped on May 6, 2013, 
along with Amanda Berry, Gina DeJesus and Miss Berry's six-year-old 
daughter from the Ohio home.

She explained how at times during those long years in the house she contemplated suicide but that her friendship with fellow captor Gina DeJesus kept her strong.

Miss Knight said: 'There were days like he'll come in and he'll just do bad things in front of me, and I'll take her hand and I'll tell her everything's gonna be OK. One day we'll get out. One day we'll be free. One day we won't be voiceless.'

The 33-year-old earlier revealed that she has cut ties with the women she was held captive with for so many dark years.

She told People that the three survivors have put distance between each other as they all come to terms with the ordeal they suffered.

Michelle Knight's memoir will be released on the first-anniversary of her escape on May 6

Miss Knight said: 'I love them and they love me. Hopefully we'll all get back together again.'

The 33-year-old has written a memoir Finding Me which comes out on May 6, the one-year anniversary of the women's escape.

In her book, she tells of the abuse she suffered at the hands of Castro, who killed himself in prison in September just weeks into his life sentence.

Knight had made a brave and defiant 
appearance at Castro's sentencing in August in which she told him: 'I 
spent 11 years in hell, your hell is just beginning.'

Ms Knight also reveals in her book the
 close bond she developed with the other women, who were all snatched 
off the streets of Cleveland by Castro between 2002 and 2004.

Ms Knight, who is 4'11, said that her hellish ordeal has taught her to enjoy every moment of her life.

She told People: 'I don't take things for granted 
anymore not even the little things like looking out a 
window. I went through years of torture, and now I'm back. I'm free to 
fly.'

Knight was 
the only one of Ariel Castro's three victims to appear in person at his 
trial. Gina DeJesus and Amanda Berry's victim impact statements were 
read by members of their family.

The
 33-year-old described how the days turned into weeks, weeks into 
eternity and said when she was 'dying' from the abuse she suffered, her 
friendship with Gina was the only thing that kept her going.

The three women were held captive in the Cleveland home of Ariel Castro for more than a decade

Michelle Knight spoke of Castro's hypocrisy as he attended church every week and then came home to torture them.

'I remember all the times you came home talking about what everyone else was doing wrong when you were doing the same thing,' she said.

'I cried every night. I was so alone. I worried what would happen to me and the other girls every day.'

Speaking of her 'teammate' Gina, she said: 'She never let me fall, I never let her fall. She nursed me back to health when I was dying from her abuse. My friendship with her is the only good thing to come out of this situation.

'I will overcome all this that happened. I will live on, you will die a little every day,' she said to him. 'I will forgive you, but I will never forget.'
