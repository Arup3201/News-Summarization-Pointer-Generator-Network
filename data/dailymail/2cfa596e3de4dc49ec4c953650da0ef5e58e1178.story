Rome will enter a bid to host the 2024 Olympic Games, Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi announced on Monday.

The application phase for potential candidates is set to formally open in September 2015, with a deadline of January 8 2016 and the announcement of the chosen venue set for the summer of 2017.

Following concerns over finance, Italy, which hosted the 1960 Olympics in Rome, had scrapped plans to bid for the 2020 Games, which will be held in Tokyo, Japan.

Renzi told a news conference at the Italian National Olympic Committee headquarters in the capital: 'The Italian government, together with CONI, is ready to do its part for a project that isn't based on great infrastructures or big dreams, but rather great people.

'We will be at the vanguard for all the spending controls.

'Our country too often seems hesitant, it is unacceptable not to try... or to renounce playing the game. Italy has all it needs to face its problems - you can't not dream.'

Last week, the International Olympic Committee passed reforms which will see bids encouraged to use existing and temporary venues, with some events able to be located outside the host city or 'in exceptional cases' even outside the chosen country.

Renzi said that Italy, which pulled out of the race for the 2020 games, could afford to host in 2024

Germany intend to submit a bid from either Berlin or Hamburg, while there has been speculation Kenya will put forward a candidate city, which if succesful would be the first from Africa to host the Games.

France are expected to back another bid from Paris, beaten by London for the 2012 Olympics, while the United States have also expressed an interest, with Boston, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Washington all potential hosts, along with Istanbul in Turkey.
