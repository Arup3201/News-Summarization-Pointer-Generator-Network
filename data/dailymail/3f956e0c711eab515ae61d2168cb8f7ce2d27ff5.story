Four huge castles in Scotland are among the palatial properties north of the border which would not be hit by the mansion tax - while a two-bedroom flat in central London would be, it emerged today.

The row over Labour's planned levy has intensified in recent days after the party's new Scottish leader Jim Murphy boasted that he would boost the NHS in Scotland by using up to £250million raised from the controversial tax in England.

Labour shadow chancellor Ed Balls has suggested a £2million threshold would be placed on the tax, with the owners of properties priced above that value taking a hit.

But low property prices in Scotland mean even the owners of the 17-bedroom baronial Orchardton Hall mansion house in Dumfries and Galloway - which is currently on the market for £1.4million - would get out of paying the charge.

Ethie Castle in Angus dates from the 14th century and has eight reception rooms and nine bedrooms - but its £1.65million price tag means it would be unaffected by Labour's planned mansion tax, which it has been suggested would only affect properties over a £2million threshold

Lickleyhead Castle near Aberdeen has seven bedrooms and a separate 'gardeners cottage' in its sprawling grounds. But at £1.35million, its owners would also not have to pay the planned charge

According to estate agents, Lickleyhead is 'a fine example of a late 15th century four-storey towerhouse, with a stone circular stairway'

Similarly, the nine-bedroom, eight-reception room £1.65million Elsie Castle in Angus, which comes with an outdoor swimming pool, tennis court and walled garden, would also avoid the tax.

The sprawling £1.65million Arbigland House mansion in Kirkbean near Dumfries, which boasts, according to estate agents, 'unprecedented views over the sea and surrounding countryside' and the turreted £1.35million Lickleyhead Castle near Aberdeen would also not incur the levy.

However, in London - where critics of the tax have pointed out that even owners of modest homes would face the charge - some small flats are priced above the £2million threshold.

A two-bedroom, fifth-floor flat in Princes Court apartment block, Knightsbridge is currently on the market for £2.1million, meaning its eventual owners will have to pay if the tax if it is brought in.

The discrepancy is one of the reasons why some of London's Labour MPs have hit out at Mr Murphy's claims of extra money for Scotland.

Arbigland House, Kirkbean, near Dumfries, is a Georgian house with a cobbled courtyard and a famous coastal garden. It is one of the 'palatial' mansions whose relatively low price compared to properties in south east England mean they would be exempt from the mansion tax

Seller says Arbigland has 'a classical Georgian entrance with good decorative stone detail' and 'beautifully proportioned'  reception rooms

Similarly Orchardton House, a baronial mansion overlooking the Solway Firth. Despite having seventeen bedrooms, it is valued at £1.4million

Estate agents say Orchardton Hall is 'a fine example of a mansion house built in the Scots Baronial style popular in the Victorian era'

Former Labour leadership candidate Diane Abbott accused Mr Murphy of trying to ‘buy Scottish votes with money expropriated from London’.

And former Labour Cabinet minister Tessa Jowell warned him against treating the South East as a ‘cash cow’.

Tottenham MP David Lammy added his voice to the Labour dissenters today when he told the Evening Standard: 'Why should the landed gentry in Scotland, or someone with a place as large as Downton Abbey, get away scot-free?'

Labour’s new mansion tax will levy an annual charge on all properties valued at more than £2million.

Full details have yet to be announced, but Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls said last year that homes worth between £2million and £3million will face an annual bill of £3,000, regardless of income.

Critics warn that the tax will disproportionately hit London and the South East, where many ordinary family homes will be caught by the plans. Fewer than 900 homes in Scotland would be affected – 0.3 per cent of the UK total.

Meanwhile in London, a fifth-floor, two-bedroom apartment in Knightsbridge's Prince Court has been valued at £2.1million, making it eligible
