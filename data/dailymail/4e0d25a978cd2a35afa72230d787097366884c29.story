Determined Kurdish forces have been  striking back against advancing ISIS militants  in a besieged town on the Syrian-Turkish border.

In a dramatic firefight taking place this evening, the forces could be seen advancing onto the ridgeline occupied by ISIS extremists near the Kurdish town of Kobani. 

Dozens of Kurdish spectators gathered just metres away to cheer on the fighters in a chorus of deafening shouts and applause, as red flares from tracer bullets propelled across the darkening sky. 

Footage of the live firefight was filmed from the Turkish side of the embattled border, which has been under attack from ISIS extremists for the past ten days.

Dozens of spectators cheered on the fighters in a chorus of deafening shouts and applause, as bouts of fire were seen shooting across the blackened sky in a live firefight filmed by CNN on the Turkish-Syrian border between ISIS militants and Kurdish forces

A reporter for CNN, which aired the live fight, said this evening's battle had caused a blow to ISIS militants, with injuries reported and several casualties seen being carried away from the bloody scene. 

ISIS has been making progress in the area for more than a week, advancing a few miles each day and forcing a human tide of Syrians - many of them ethnic Kurds - to flee to Turkey.

Today, a baby's cot was among the items left abandoned by fleeing Syrians, as women, children and the elderly escaped their homes amid heavy fighting between ISIS fighters and Kurdish forces. 

The ongoing clashes around the town - also known as Ayn Arab - have already sent more than 150,000 refugees into the Turkish province of Sanliurfa - the largest single outflow of refugees since Syria's conflict began more than three years ago.  

Today, Turkish Kurds gathered about 100metres from Turkish ground to see the fighting between ISIS and Kurdish forces in the next village on the Syrian side

A spokeswoman for the UN agency for refugees (UNHCR) said Turkey had now seen the biggest influx of refugees in the past three years, since ISIS descended on the embattled area

ISIS fighters launched the offensive against Syrian Kurds last week, forcing inhabitants to flee across the border

Islamic State has maintained its grip on territory on three sides of the strategic town, with sporadic clashes continuing today amid the firing of heavy weapons fire heard

The start of attacks in the area appeared to spark a state of panic within the Kurdish community and Turkish soldiers were deployed to stem the relentless flow into their country

A spokesman for the UN agency for refugees (UNHCR) said the number of refugees had dramatically increased since ISIS engulfed the town on three sides and said it represented the largest exodus of refugees from the war-torn country in the past three years. 

The latest fighting comes after U.S.-led coalition warplanes struck the border town for the first time, sparking a retaliation of shelling from the jihadi fighters.

The U.S. Central Command said the air strikes, carried out earlier today, destroyed an ISIS building and two armed vehicles. 

Nawaf Khalil, a spokesman for Syria's Kurdish Democratic Union Party, or PYD, said the jihadi fighters later shelled the town, wounding a number of civilians. One of the mortars blew a large hole in an empty minibus parked near Tavsanli, a nearby village.

The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the coalition's strikes came amid heavy fighting between ISIS and members of the Kurdish force, known as the People's Protection Units, or YPK.

Dozens of people wounded in the fighting arrived in Turkey for treatment on Saturday, it said.  

Women and children alike were seen carrying their belongings across the border, joining the mass exodus of Syrian refugees who have already fled to Turkey

Authorities in the border province of Sanliurfa have now blocked the main road to the Syrian border as security worsens in the area. 

Meanwhile, Turkish Kurds living in the region were seen gathered about 100metres from the Turkish ground watching the fighting between the two sides. 

Hundreds of Kurds broke yesterday through the Turkish border into Syrian territory to join Kurdish forces - known as the Protection of the Kurdish People - battling ISIS militants around the town.

The Syrian Kurdish forces have long been one of the most effective fighting units battling ISIS, but the tide has turned in recent weeks as the  militants have attacked with heavy weapons, believed to belong to neighboring Iraq.

Kobani sits on a road linking north and north-western Syria. Kurdish control of the town has prevented ISIS fighters from consolidating their gains.

The United States and five Arab allies launched an aerial campaign against ISIS in Syria early on Tuesday with the aim of crushing the extremist group. 

Elsewhere, hundreds of Kurdish activists and their supporters have protested in Paris to denounce violence by ISIS and demand greater Western support against the militants.

Waving flags and chanting Kurdish songs, as many as 2,000 demonstrators marched  to demand greater firepower from the West to help the outgunned Kurds stave off assaults by ISIS.

In London, Oxford Street was brought to a standstill as Kurdish protesters called on countries to unite against ISIS.

Scuffles broke out with police at one point as the demonstrators chanted and waved placards to condemn the militant group's brutal attacks in the Middle East. 

Akif Rizgar Wan, the UK representative of the Kurdistan National Congress, said he backed British air strikes in Iraq and called on the UK Government to target Isis in Syria as well.

'Kurdish people are being killed, thousands of them. It is inhumane. We are against ISIS killing innocent people, specifically the vulnerable, women and elderly people.'
