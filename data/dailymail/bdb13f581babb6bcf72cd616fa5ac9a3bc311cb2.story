A New Mexico father is fighting the state of Utah for his daughter that was given up in 2008 for adoption without his consent.

Robert Manzanares, 36, of Las Cruces, is in Colorado for a three-day juvenile court hearing that will determine the fate of daughter Kaia – he wants sole custody, the adoptive parents want a joint agreement.

The case is in a Colorado court because he filed an injunction there before the baby was born in Utah.

He wants his daughter back: Robert Manzanares is in court this week to determine who will get custody of his daughter

The joint custody agreement proposed by 
the adoptive parents, who are related to the six-year-old girl’s 
biological mother, treats Mr Manzanares ‘like a divorced, out-of-state 
father with visitation rights,’ he told the Salt Lake Tribune.

Mr Manzanares has been fighting for custody of his daughter since before she was born, he filed a court injunction while the mother was still pregnant after he learned of her plans to give the baby up for adoption.

She traveled to Utah just before the young girl was born in 2008. She is accused by Mr Manzanares of giving birth in the state to circumvent his filing for custody so she could give the baby to relatives.

‘It’s just unbelievable that it can take a father five years to gain visitation, much less six years to get to who has the right to raise his child,’ he told the paper.

‘Constitutionally [I] should have every right to raise [my] child,’ he added.

Mr Manzanares isn't opposed to having the adoptive parents in Kaia's life, but he wants full custody of his daughter.

'I want to to live with you': Kaia did not want to go back to the Utah couple raising her, Mr Manzanares claims

A Colorado court ruling in January of last year sided with Mr Manzanares’ contention that he was improperly barred from intervening to gain custody of his daughter.

He has been gradually reintroduced into his daughter’s life during visits to Utah in the time since that ruling. She even spent an extended period of time with him in New Mexico.

‘The visit to NM was very successful and Kaia was so happy to meet a lot more of her family and to bond with her step sisters and brother,’ he posted on Facebook shortly after she left.

‘She said, ‘I want to live with you… my other family is not my real family only you are, why do I have to live with them?’ He said she asked, before adding that it broke his heart, but had to let the court process play out.

Subsequent postings had Mr Manzanares
saying he had nothing but the best interests of his daughter at heart, 
and that the adoptive parents even tried to bully him into paying child 
support.

‘They messed with the wrong father,’ he wrote.

Lawyers for both sides declined to speak to the Tribune and were unable to be reached by MailOnline because they are in court.

This case echoes a number of others recently that have garnered national attention as fathers fight to gain custody of children given up for adoption without their consent.

The most recent involves 19-year-old Preston King, who is fighting for custody of son Wyatt after the child's teen mother put her up for adoption when she couldn't afford to raise him. This case has yet to be decided.

The most famous case involves 'baby Veronica,' whose soldier father waged a custody war with her adoptive parents that saw the girl shuttled between Kansas and South Carolina multiple times.

He was almost arrested for refusing to hand her back to her adoptive parents after a court ruled he must, and then famously ended the custody battle in a teary-eyed press conference.
