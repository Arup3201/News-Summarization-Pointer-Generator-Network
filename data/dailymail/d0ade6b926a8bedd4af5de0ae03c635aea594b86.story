A witness identified the 22-year-old nephew of New York Giants owner John Mara as the person he saw smash a bottle over the head of a fellow college student during a New Year's Eve party, it was revealed on Thursday.

The nephew, also named John Mara, was arrested by Fairfield police last week and posted $150,000 bail.

The Mount Kisco, New York, resident is to be arraigned March 8 in Bridgeport Superior Court on first-degree assault and breach of peace charges.

Mara's lawyer, William Dow III, said Mara will plead not guilty and he's confident a jury will agree.

‘We'll address the charges in court, not in the media,’ Dow said Thursday.

The alleged victim, Philip Blackman, 
said he had no recollection of the assault. He said doctors told him 
that if he had not gotten to the hospital and had emergency surgery to 
relieve pressure on his brain he might have died that night.

The arrest affidavit states that Blackman suffered a skull fracture and a brain hemorrhage.

According to his LinkedIn profile, 
Blackman currently works as auto technician assistant for Weston Service
Center in Weston, Connecticut. He is expected to graduate from 
Fairfield University with a bachelor's degree in communications and 
marketing.

Luke Kazmierczak, who was home from 
college for the holidays, told police he witnessed the incident. But he 
initially did not pick Mara out of a photo lineup of six men, the 
affidavit says.

Police say in the affidavit that the 
photo of Mara, a senior at Fairfield University, was when he was a 
freshman and looked significantly different.

When Kazmierczak was later shown an updated photo, he immediately picked out Mara as the person he saw hit Blackman, police say.

Also, David O'Brien, a friend of 
Kazmierczak's, took a photo of Mara that night and picked Mara out from a
photo lineup as the person his friend told him committed the assault, 
the affidavit says.

Blackman said his friends told him he 
had bumped into a girl by accident at the party and some people at the 
party were trying to kick him and his friends out, according to the 
affidavit.

Police say Mara was upset after he was
told while walking to the house that his roommate's girlfriend was hit 
by someone. They describe him as highly intoxicated at the time and not 
wearing a shirt despite below-freezing temperatures.

‘I saw them fighting,’ a witness told
the New York Daily News. ‘I saw both groups come in. Both were drunk, 
looking for a fight and aggressive. Just drunk college kids.’

Another witness told the paper that Mara was defending himself against a bigger man.

‘If you have a bottle in your hand, you don't need to be [big],’ said the witness, who is also a student at Fairfield.

Mara denied the assault, police say. 
But they say when they asked him why others were accusing him of the 
assault, he said: ‘I'm not sure. If I actually did do it, I would love 
to find out.’

Police say when they asked if it was 
possible he did not know he hit Blackman, Mara replied: ‘It could of 
happened because I was very drunk and there's a shot that I didn't 
remember.’

Mara is an anthropology and sociology 
major at the Jesuit School and lives in the nearby beachfront 
neighborhood where the assault allegedly occurred, university 
spokeswoman Martha Milcarek has said.

If convicted, he could face up to 20 years in prison. Mara may also be disciplined by the college.

‘In a situation like this, not only is
a student subject to any civil action but there would be an 
investigation from the standpoint of the school and, pending the 
outcome, the student would be subject to the disciplinary code of the 
university,’ Milcarek told CBS News.

A spokesman for the Giants said Monday
that the team and John Mara, president and chief executive officer of 
the Giants, had no comment on the arrest.

Mara, whose father, Frank Mara, is 
also Vice President of Community Relations for the Giants handed himself
in to a police station in Fairfield, Connecticut, on Friday on charges 
of first degree assault and breach of the peace.

Frank and his son Jack are central figures in the large but clone-knit Mara clan.

Jack
regularly posts pictures from Giants games he attends with his father 
on his various social media profiles where he keeps in touch with many 
members of his extended family.

His father is the youngest son of the 11 children of Giants founder Wellington Mara and his wife Ann.

The Mara family own 50 per cent of the
team with Frank's oldest brother, John, at the helm and their brother 
Chris also in backroom staff.

The
Irish-American clan are well-known in New York as well as Hollywood 
where Jack's cousins actresses Rooney and Kate have become stars in 
their own right.

Like his son, Frank attended Fairfield University, graduating in 1982.

He lives in Bedford Corners, New York, with his wife Lynn. They have three other sons Sean, Frankie and Owen.   

Jack's
mother Lynn is an artist and teaches sixth grade religion at St Paul's 
in Greenwich. She also sits on the Giants Foundation.

In an interview for a Hamptons Magazine she said her perfect day would include 'a long happy dinner time with family and all the kids'.
