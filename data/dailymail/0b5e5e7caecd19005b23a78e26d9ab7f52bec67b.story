After an unbeaten start to the Bundesliga season, Bayern Munich's players were rewarded with a visit to Oktoberfest on Sunday. 

Bayern have won five and drawn two of their opening seven games, and were treated to a day off to don their Lederhosen, in what has become an annual trip to the festival.

Pictures on the club's official Twitter and Instagram accounts showed the players in fetching chequered shirts and braces, as they arrived by coach to the world-renowned Munich event.

The club's official Instagram account tweeted a picture, with the message, 'Off we go to #Oktoberfest! They've deserved it after their performances in recent weeks!' 

Xabi Alonso posed for pictures, wearing a traditional green hat and clutching a pint of beer - the main staple of the festival.
