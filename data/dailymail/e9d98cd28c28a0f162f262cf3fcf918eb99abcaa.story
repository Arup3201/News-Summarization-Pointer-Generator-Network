An American doctor who survived Ebola recounted the details of his horrifying experience to a congressional committee today on Capitol Hill as part of a bid to raise awareness about the deadly disease. 

As a medical professional, Dr. Kent Brantly told Senators he 'witnessed the horror that this disease visits upon its victims.' 

But after contracting the disease himself in late July while treating Ebola in Liberia, Brantly said he came to understand first-hand the suffering of his patients.

'I was isolated and unsure if I would ever see my family again,' he said. 'Even though I knew most of my care givers, I could see nothing but their eyes through their protective goggles when they came to treat me. 

'I experienced the humiliation of losing control of my bodily functions, and I faced the horror of vomiting blood, a sign of the internal bleeding that could have led to my death.'

Ebola survivor Dr. Kent Brantly, the former medical director for Samaritan's Purse Ebola Care Center in Monrovia, Liberia, recalled his near-death experience with the virus to Senators today during a hearing in Washington, D.C.

Brantly's recovery from the virus is somewhat of a mystery. Doctors have been unable to determine whether an experimental drug, a blood transfusion from another Ebola survivor, specialized care at a medical facility in Atlanta, Georgia, or a combination of all three saved his life.

What is evident from his appearance at a joint meeting of the Senate health and appropriations committees is that that he is fully rehabilitated. 

Sen. Barbara Mikulski noted Brantly's remarkable recovery during the afternoon hearing, noting how happy the committee was to see him.

'What's so great about seeing you Dr. Brantly is one, that you're well enough to be here. You were well enough to travel here,' Mikulski, a senior Democrat on the committee, said.

'And you're well enough that we're not afraid to have you here. And we can smile, but this is a stunning, stunning, stunning accomplishment!'

The bipartisan group of Senators weren't the only U.S. leaders who were brave enough to meet with Brantly during his trip to Washington.

President Barack Obama also sat down with the Ebola survivor on Tuesday afternoon in the White House before leaving Washington for a trip to visit a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention facility in Georgia.

The White House did not release details on the meeting but it did share a photo of a smiling Brantly and his wife Amber sitting in the Oval Office with the president.  

'I had the privilege and honor of meeting with President Obama this morning and we discussed his commitment of more military and medical resources to fight this epidemic,' Brantly told Senators in his opening statement.

'I thanked him for entering this battle with us in a larger way.'

Brantly said it was 'imperative' that the president follow through on his plans to send 3,000 troops to Liberia and to establish a military control center for coordination, as well as his proposal to build 17 new treatment centers for Ebola and hold training for medical professionals in the country. 

Up to this point, the U.S. government's response to the outbreak has 'remained sluggish and unacceptably out of step with with the scope and the size of the problem that is now before us,' Brantly testified.

The disease has already infected close to 5,000 West Africans and roughly half of them have died.

'As a survivor, it is not only my privilege, but it is my duty to speak out on behalf of the people of West Africa who continue to face unspeakable devastation because of this horrific disease,' Brantly told the senators.

Brantly warned that Liberia would not be able 'to turn the tide on the disease' without the $88 million the president has requested from Congress to fight Ebola, including $58 million that would go toward creating more of the antiviral drug that Brantly received and another drug believed to be a vaccine.

'We cannot wait, however, for a magic bullet to halt the spread of this virus in West Africa,' he said. 'The current epidemic is beyond anything we have seen before, and it's time to think outside the box.'

Dr. Brantly said that communities must be educated on how to properly care for someone who contracts Ebola because many patients in West Africa are staying home, where their families either abandon them or care for them in ways that 'almost always results in infection of the caregivers.'

'This is a major contributor to the spread of Ebola and we cannot contain the disease with addressing this problem head on,' he said.

Brantly shared the story of one of his patients who contracted the disease from a man whose wife was committed to getting him care regardless of the risk.

When no one else would help her, Brantly said his patient, Francis, helped put the man in a taxi. In the process, Francis contracted Ebola and died on the way to the hospital.

'If someone had come alongside Francis and given him a little bit of education and provided him with the personal protective equipment he needed, his family would still have their father, their son, and their brother, and the world might still have this good Samaritan,' Brantly said.

Noting that some government officials had described Ebola as a fast-moving forest fire, Brantly told the Senators, 'Indeed it is a fire.'

'It is a fire straight from the pit of hell,' he said, choking up.

'We cannot fool ourselves into thinking that the vast mode of the Atlantic ocean will protect us from the flames of this fire,' he continued.

'Instead, we must move quickly and immediately to deliver the promises that have been made and to be open to practical innovative interventions. This is the only way to keep entire nations from being reduced to ashes.'

In remarks of his own on the Ebola epidemic this afternoon President Obama said the United States cannot 'dawdle' in responding to the medical crisis. 

If the federal government does not act quickly to stop the outbreak, 'we could be looking at hundreds of thousands of people infected, with profound economic and security implications for all of us,' Obama said in a speech outside the CDC center in Atlanta.

'It's not a mystery. We know the science. We know how to prevent it from spreading. We know how to care for those who contract it. We know that if we take the proper steps, we can save lives,' Obama said.

'The world is looking to the United States, and it’s a responsibility we embrace.'
