Frequent use of 'text speak' - such as gr8 and m8 - is eroding school pupils' ability in written English, a leading head has said today (library image)

Protecting standards of English from the influence of text message and social media slang is one of the biggest challenges facing teachers, a leading headmistress has suggested.

Caroline Jordan, head of a top private girls' school in Oxford, warned a generation of children are leaving school without a proper grasp of spelling and grammar because of the impact of so-called textspeak.

Youngsters are also in danger of growing up with limited vocabularies because they spend so much of their free time on sites such as Twitter and Facebook instead of reading.

Mrs Jordan, of Headington School where fees are up to £30,000-a-year, said government plans to introduce a maths qualification for sixth-formers who choose not to take an A-level in the subject were poorly thought through, and suggested an English assessment would be more useful.

Her remarks follow complaints from teachers that pupils increasingly use abbreviations and colloquialisms in school work and tests. Examples highlighted by English staff include 'ur' for 'your', 'm8' for 'mate' and 'I donno huu u r' for 'I don't know who you are'.

In her latest blog, Mrs Jordan wrote: 'If we are going to make all students carry on with one subject at sixth form, why not English?

'Our English skills are constantly on display, often making the difference between landing a job and having a misspelled application filed in the bin.

'With the continuing reliance on technology, "textspeak" is eroding hard-learned skills in such basic areas as spelling and grammar.

Research from Coventry University showed pupils who made fewer punctuation mistakes when texting tended to be better at spelling (library image)

SENTENCES WRITTEN BY PUPILS

'I noe u dnt noee mii, I donno huu u r' - I know you don't know me, I don't know who you are

Hitler was 'majorly bad'

Macbeth was 'pure mental'

'Perhaps this is the area we should be
 seeking to protect above all else. A command of our own language in 
today's competitive world is essential.'

She
 added: 'We should teach English in a traditional way. The correct use 
of grammar and spelling is important but there is going to be a whole 
generation which is not necessarily able to do that.

'Textspeak
 is having an inevitable impact on this generation and they need to 
realise when it's appropriate to write the correct response to a 
question.

'If youngsters are
 not reading in the same way, and if they are spending a lot of time 
using social media, I wonder how much new vocabulary they are exposed 
to.'

A poll of 500 teachers
 found that many youngsters used colloquialisms in formal written work, 
with phrases such as 'Macbeth was pure mental' and 'Romeo was a numpty 
wasn't he?'.

GCSE and 
A-level examiners have also warned that text message slang is appearing 
in students' answers, revealing how youngsters are becoming careless in 
their use of it.

Meanwhile studies have shown a tentative link between frequent text messaging and poor written English.

An
 American study, by Pennsylvania State University, detected a decline in
 scores in grammar tests if text messages contained lots of shortened 
words.

Mrs Jordan also suggested the syllabus for the planned sixth-form maths exam should be more practical.

'I
 would like to see more attention paid to essential practical aspects 
such as financial and household management and a clear understanding of 
the sometimes bewildering world of interest rates and mortgages,' she 
added.
