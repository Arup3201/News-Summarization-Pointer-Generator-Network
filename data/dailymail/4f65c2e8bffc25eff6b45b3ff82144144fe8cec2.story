A priest was among at least 16 people killed today after the second earthquake to strike northern Italy within nine days caused his church to collapse and toppled scores of other buildings.

Father Ivo Martini died after he and a firefighter went inside his church in Rovereto di Novi, near Modena, to recover a Virgin Mary statue following this morning's 5.8 magnitude tremor at 9am.

He perished in a subsequent masonry collapse during one of the four other aftershocks measuring above 4.0 that also hit the industrially important Emilia Romagna region during 90 terrifying minutes.

Father Martini is believed to have been crushed under a beam. The firefighter escaped.

His church, Santa Caterina, was one of several religious  buildings that were badly damaged after being weakened by the May 20 earthquake in Emilia Romagna that left seven people dead.

The 16th century cathedral in Mirandola, which was cracked following the last major quake, was destroyed in today's tremor.

Rubble now surrounds the altar of the cathedral, the wooden pews crushed like matchsticks under tons of masonry, after the roof fell in.

Another priest in Carpi is believed to have been rescued from rubble after his church collapsed.

The injured included a 65-year-old woman who was pulled out alive by rescuers after lying for 12 hours in the rubble of her apartment's kitchen in Cavezzo, another town hit hard by the quake.

Firefighters told Sky TG24 TV that a piece of furniture, which had toppled over, saved her from being crushed by the wreckage. She was taken to a hospital for treatment.

Nearby Modena, which is known for its Balsamic vinegar and is at the centre of famous culinary region, was again the epicentre for today's earthquake.

The tremors toppled buildings across the area, the home of Parmesan cheese, Parma ham, Ferrari cars and singer Luciano Pavarotti.

The region is among the country's most productive and the earthquake risks worsening its recession and making the job of tackling its massive debt problem even harder.

The two recent earthquakes are particularly surprising because the region lies in the middle of the Po plain, which is traditionally considered safer than other areas of seismic Italy.

The quake was the most deadly to strike Italy since 2009 when a tremor partially destroyed the central city of L'Aquila, killing about 300 and leaving thousands homeless.

Among the towns to be badly hit today was San Felice sul Panaro, where at least three people died when a factory collapsed.

Two of the victims have been named as immigrants Pawan Kumar, 31, from India and Azaar Mohamad, 45, of Morocco.  Both men were married fathers. The third dead man is Italian.

As rescuers across the region clawed at rubble to reach survivors, Italian Premier Mario Monti pledged to do 'all that it must and all that is possible in the briefest period to guarantee the resumption of normal life in this area that is so special, so important and so productive for Italy.'

Other victims included those residents still living in tents following the last quake. They were forced to flee again when they felt the ground shaking this morning.

The official death tolls stands at 15 people, but there were fears that others had also been killed by falling masonry.

The quake was felt across the whole of Italy with people running into the streets as far away as Milan Venice, Genoa and Perugia with shocks also felt in neighbouring Austria.

A spokesman for the Italian Geophysical and Volcanology Institute said that there had been a series of five aftershocks in the thirty five minutes after the main earthquake measuring between 3.1 and 4.0 on the Richter scale.

Alessandro Amato of the Institute said: ‘It looks like a new fault line has broken - this earthquake happened just 40km west of the initial one earlier this month.’

Train services north of Bologna, major junction in the Italian network were also disrupted with services from the city to Milan, Venice and Verona being affected.

Mobile networks were also affected with communication in and out of the affected area sporadic as frantic relatives and friends tried to call loved ones across a wide swathe of northern Italy.

Terrified locals fled into the streets in the city of Bologna as shops, schools, offices and factories emptied while other neighbouring towns and cities ordered immediate evacuations of all public buildings.

Hit again: It is the second earthquake to strike northern Italy in little over a week. This clock tower at Finale Emilia was torn apart in the tremor on May 20

Epicentre: The earthquake struck near the city of the Modena, in northern Italy, with tremors felt across the region

Three of the dead were workers at a factory in San Felice, while two workers were thought to have been killed in Medolla near Modena after a warehouse collapsed.

Fernando Ferioli, the mayor of Finale Emilia, which was also severely damaged in the earlier earthquake said: ‘It's a disaster here. There have been fresh collapses. This is another earthquake it is not an aftershock.’

After the initial earthquake earlier this month at least 5,000 people were made temporarily homeless and put in makeshift tents and today civil protection teams were once again heading into the area to set up accommodation.

A international friendly football match between Italy and Luxembourg, which was due to be played in Parma tonight, has been cancelled.
