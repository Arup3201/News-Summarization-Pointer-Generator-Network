Arsene Wenger has become like Ian Beale - he's got nothing left. And when the long-serving EastEnder lost the lot - business, home and self respect - he went a bit crazy.

Frenchman Wenger might as well jump on a tube to Walford East and go looking for Phil Mitchell's shoulder to cry on.  In fact, Walford Town is probably more the Frenchman's level tactically.

Arsenal games are great entertainment for the neutral and my work is taking me to four in the next month - I can't wait to see a load of their players ambling back from the opposition half while three or four opponents surge towards Wojciech Szczesny's goal.

Mathieu Flamini caught in a time warp, thinking he has the legs of a 21-year-old as he loiters around the edge of the opposition penalty area while Szczesny is overwhelmed at the other end of the field.

Mikel Arteta looks desperate to go back to his attacking ways, which is understandable. That's why Arsenal signed him.

There was talk of how the Manchester United game would have been over by half-time had Arsenal been more clinical. These people must have missed the Anderlecht performance.

Tactically Arsenal are a joke. A very funny one, too.

To make it worse, Wenger revealed recently that he tried – and failed – to sign both Paul Pogba and Lionel Messi. Quite how that conversation with Messi went is open to speculation.

Wenger: 'Lionel, do you want to come to Arsenal?'

Messi: 'No thanks.'

But imagine the team that Wenger 'nearly' bought. It includes Luis Suarez, Pogba, Messi and Cesc Fabregas. He's not helping himself by talking about players he possibly could have signed but didn't.

Credit to Wenger though, for signing Alexis Sanchez. He has been a joy to watch this season. But when you step back for a second, you should be asking whether that was an area of the team where they needed to spend £30million.

This is why I question that signing. If you're asking whether Wenger signed a quality player in Alexis Sanchez, then the answer is obviously yes.

If you put the question into context, then it becomes a debate. Was signing a player like Sanchez Wenger's priority in the summer? No, of course not. It was clear even last season that Arsenal needed a centre-half and a defensive midfielder to make them genuine contenders for the Premier League and the Champions League.

Take Sanchez away from the side and Arsenal would be even worse of course. But take him away and replace him with a centre-half and a defensive midfielder bought with that money, and they might be doing a lot better than they are now.

The proof is in the results and performances so far this season.

Wenger should have signed the players the team needed, and if he got Sanchez on top of that then Arsenal could have been brilliant this season.

So many high quality defensive midfielders have been bought and sold since Arsenal last had a decent one – that was Gilberto Silva who left in 2008. And worryingly for Gunners fans, Wenger spoke last week about giving Abou Diaby a new contract. Don't misunderstand me, I have every sympathy for injured players. But Diaby is not the answer to Arsenal's problems.

Have a look at every other Premier League club. Could it be argued that they all have better options in defensive midfield positions than Arsenal?

Neither Arteta nor Flamini do the job properly, so would, for example, Sandro or Karl Henry at bottom-of-the-table QPR be better? I'm not saying Wenger should sign those two, but it's not ridiculous to suggest they are both better at holding in midfield than the Arsenal pair.

Some might say the players Arsenal need are hard to find. But a man of Wenger's experience should know that the likes of Lars Bender and Mats Hummels are the missing pieces.

Can Wenger persuade them to come to the Emirates? He's not worth his £8million-a-year salary if he can't.
