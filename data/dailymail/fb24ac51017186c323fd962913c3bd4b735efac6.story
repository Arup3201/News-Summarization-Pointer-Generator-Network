Donald Trump today announced plans for a new luxury hotel in Azerbaijan to open in June 2015.

The towering 33-floor establishment,  in the Nasimi District of Baku, will boast spectacular panoramic views of the Caspian Sea and across the city.

The magnate's daughter and executive vice president of development and acquisitions of The Trump Organization, Ivanka Trump travelled to the country a fortnight ago to tour the building site.

'This incredible building reflects the highest level of luxury and refinement, with extraordinary architecture inspired by the Caspian Sea and sophisticated interiors that seamlessly blend contemporary style with timeless appeal,' she said.

'We are looking forward to bringing our unparalleled Trump services and amenities to Azerbaijan.'

Upon completion the hotel will feature  72 'ultra-luxury' residences, 30 suites, 40 serviced apartments and 119 guest rooms.

Site tour: Construction is well under way on the 33-floor property, which will boast views of the Caspian Sea

The residences will range in size from 84 square metres up to a staggering 890 square metres, and will be available for long-term lease.

VIP guests of the residences will have access to a private driveway and entrance, and the grand residential lobby will feature gold-leaf glass.

The hotel will boast a luxury spa with multiple pools, a 500 square-metre ballroom, 147 square metres of retail, champagne bar and a signature restaurant from a yet-to-be-announced but 'globally acclaimed' restaurateur.

East meets west: Baku sits on the Caspian Sea, straddling Eastern Europe and Western Asia

The building, designed by London firm Mixity Design, resembles the mast of a sail, not dissimilar to the Dubai Burj Al Arab's famed silhouette.

Baku-based developer Garant Holding is carrying out construction of the property. Shareholder Anar Mammadov said: 'We are thrilled to work with The Trump Organization, the most renowned luxury developer in the world, to provide visitors to and residents of Baku with a world-class hotel and homes that bring a new generation of style, exclusivity and prestige.'

The hotel opening slated for next summer will lead three additional Trump Hotel Collection properties slated for 2016. Hotels in Washington, D.C., Vancouver and Rio de Janeiro are currently under construction.

Lonely Planet describes Azerbaijan as 'a nexus of ancient historical empires' as well as 'a "new" nation rapidly emerging on a petroleum-funded gust of optimism.'

The old centre of Baku has Unesco status, but the Trump hotel will join an increasing number of skyscrapers dotting the skyline.
