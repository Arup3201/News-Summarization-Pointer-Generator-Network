Wayne Rooney admits he has one last shot at the biggest tournament of the lot.

Rooney seems happy and relaxed here in Portugal — there was that touching moment at the end of an England training session when he ran over to kiss his four-year-old son Kai.

But the serious stuff starts soon. Rooney insists that England will go to Brazil aiming to win the tournament and accepts this is his final realistic chance to make a major impact at a World Cup.

It was an issue his former team-mate Paul Scholes addressed on Thursday, even predicting Rooney’s possible retirement in his early thirties.

At 28, Rooney knows the clock is ticking on his career. ‘At the World Cup in 2018, I’ll be older so it will be difficult to make an impact,’ Rooney admitted at England’s Portugal training base.

‘I want to show the world what I can do and this is the time do it. There will be no excuses.

‘This is the last big one that I feel will get the best out of me. I can deliver and this is the one where I have to show what I can do.’

So this really is it. Rooney’s last chance to rule the world.

We have been here before, catapulting him into the same category as the Brazilian Ronaldo before the 2006 World Cup and Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo at the 2010 tournament in South Africa.

No-one will make the same mistake again. This time it’s up to Rooney to perform, to score his first goal at a World Cup and lead England out of their group. Goodness knows he has enough talent to do that.

‘The tournaments haven’t gone great for me but I’m hoping this one will. I feel fresh, I feel fit, I feel ready.

‘When you’re going into a tournament, you believe you’re going to do well, so you don’t really feel that pressure, but maybe inside you are feeling it, which you don’t realise.

‘The World Cup is a tough tournament. I think for myself I want to go in and I want to prove myself at this level, which I haven’t been able to do before.’

There is a maturity about him and he revealed that he will meet the England team psychiatrist Steve Peters to ‘see if he can add an extra two per cent’ to his game.

Rooney’s preparation is going smoothly so far. He arrived in Vale do Lobo a week early, posting Facebook videos of his workouts on the lush playing surface that lips one of the Algarve’s finest golf courses.

There is a bit of Paul Gascoigne about the way in which he is squeezing all this extra fitness work into a short time frame before England’s World Cup warm-up with Peru at Wembley next Friday.

Rooney missed the final three games of the season with Manchester United after his interim  manager Ryan Giggs accepted that he needed time to recover from a minor injury.

He was a little irritated to be reminded of Sir Alex Ferguson’s claim in his autobiography that Rooney struggles to recover from injuries quickly — ‘he would say that’ — but that was the only time he bristled.

‘In previous tournaments I’ve had little injuries which have stopped me training in the first week, so I’ve been delighted to start the first sessions.’

It is in these training sessions that Rooney has been impressed by the young players picked for England’s World Cup squad.

Luke Shaw, Raheem Sterling and Ross Barkley have all had outstanding seasons and merit their places in the squad. Sterling, in particular, was outstanding in Tuesday’s open training session.

‘I’m sure you’ll agree the selection Roy has made is exciting,’ says Rooney. ‘There’s a lot of young players and a lot of pace in the team, which maybe we didn’t have before. 

‘Hopefully the young lads will go in with no fear, do what they do for their clubs and if they do that we will have a really strong team and do what we want. Sterling, Jordan Henderson and  Barkley have all been so exciting this season and the way they have kicked on is great to see.

‘If Roy didn’t give them a chance can you imagine the effect it might have had on them? Everyone can feel the excitement around the squad.

‘Our aim is to win the tournament — that is what we are preparing for and what we hope is going to happen.’

For something like that to  happen, Rooney really will need to be the main man.
