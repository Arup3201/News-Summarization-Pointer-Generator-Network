For Christie Newport, life is lived behind firmly closed doors, hidden from the world.

She shys away from social gatherings and is confined to her bed  - the slightest movement leaving her in excruciating pain.

The 33-year-old was diagnosed with the rare neurological disorder Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome  when she was a teenager.

It causes recurring facial paralysis or palsy, and a gradual swelling of the face and lips.

Such is the complexity of her condition, Ms Newport has to take a host of medication including steroids, which have caused her to gain weight.

Taunts from cruel bullies, who dubbed her 'rubber dingy lips', and the pain she faces each day left her feeling suicidal.

Ms Newport, pictured with her wife Amy, said the constant medication, including steroids, that she has to take has caused her to gain weight 

Various medicines, as well as plastic surgery on her lips, have failed to help.

But after speaking to a fellow sufferer of the condition, Ms Newport discovered a new pioneering stem cell treatment, available in California.

She and her wife Amy have now embarked on a mission to raise the £12,000 needed to fund the treatment.

'I have one of the worst cases there is and I just don't feel like I have a life anymore,' Ms Newport said.

'It's like it has been stolen by my illness. I'm prepared to do anything to get the treatment because I can't live like this.

'If I could avoid living like this, I would do it tomorrow.' 

Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome is a rare neurological disorder.

Patients diagnosed with the condition suffer recurring facial paralysis or palsy, swelling of the face and lips.

The condition is often first detected in childhood or early adolescence.

After a series of attacks, the swelling is likely to persist and eventually becomes permanent.

A sufferers lips can become hard and cracked, with a reddish-brown discolouration.

Scientists do not know what causes the syndrome but there is thought to be a familial link, though no gene has been identified yet.

Treatment involves various medications to target the symptoms, with anti-inflammatory medication and corticosteroids to reduce swelling.

At the age of 18, Ms Newport, from Ashton-on-Ribble, Lancashire, was told by doctors she was suffering Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome.

The diagnosis came around 10 years after she first started suffering symptoms.

'I was really glad it got given a name and I thought it meant there would be some kind of treatment,' she said.

But over the years, her health has worsened - so much so that her airways swell and she has problems with her lungs, leaving her in extreme pain. 

The condition has progressed to her epiglottis, larynx and face, causing her type 2 steroid-induced diabetes and a paralysed right diaphragm.

And the steroids she takes to manage the symptoms have caused her stomach, arms and legs to swell up.

Ms Newport, who is unable to have children as a result of the syndrome, said: 'The doctors always said their hope is it will improve as time goes on - but what has happened is the opposite.

'It's spread through my body now and I am lucky if I can get a couple of hours out of bed in the day. 

'It has made me realise how limited my life has become.'

But after years of coping with the condition, Ms Newport said she is now thrilled there is a treatment  that will reduce the inflammation and hopefully combat her over-active immune system.

She said: 'I don't want my condition to get any worse. People don't get it. I feel isolated.

Ms Newport, pictured age three, left and four, right, started to show signs of the condition when she was around seven years old, but it wasn't until she was 18 that doctors officially diagnosed her illness

'There's times when I have felt "what is the point?" I move from the bed to the couch to the hospital.

'It would change my life and it would change the lives of people around me.

'I would do anything to have a life. I would get a career, I would do all the things that I am missing out on.

'But the fact it is in America means it costs money.'

Her wife Amy, 25, who was forced to give up her job in a call centre to care for Christie, added: 'It is very hard.

'When we first got together we were always out. Now our excitement is going to her mum's for a brew.

'She will be in bed for most of the day. To people thinking about donating I would say "do it, it would be amazing".'
