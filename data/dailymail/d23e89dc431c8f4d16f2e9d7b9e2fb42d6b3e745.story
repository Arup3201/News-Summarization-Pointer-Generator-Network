A Siberian tiger released into
the wild by Russian President Vladimir Putin is reportedly the main suspect
in a series of goat deaths in China's northeast.

Siberian tiger experts have pegged Ustin, one of three tigers freed by the Russian president in remote Siberia back in June, as the killer of two goats, the official Xinhua news agency said.

Three goats belonging to local farmers are still missing.

The dead goats' skulls had been crushed with puncture holes 'the size of a human finger
clearly visible', according to a Xinhua witness.

Ustin crossed into China in October with another of Putin's
tigers, both of which carry tracking devices, Xinhua said.

A wildlife protection expert has warned people not to throw food at the tiger if spotted. 

Mr Putin was praised by Russian media for saving a television crew from an attack by a Siberian tiger back in 2008.

The Russian president apparently saved the crew while on a trip to a national park to see how researchers monitor the tigers in the wild.

Just as he was arriving with a group of wildlife specialists to see a trapped Amur tiger, it escaped and ran towards a nearby camera crew, the country's main television station said. 

Mr Putin quickly shot the beast and sedated it with a tranquilizer gun.
