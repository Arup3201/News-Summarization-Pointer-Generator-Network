Former Germany and Scotland manager Berti Vogts has undergone a long-planned heart operation, the German Football Federation has announced.

The 68-year-old, who coached Germany to success at Euro 96 and was a World Cup winner as a player in 1974, is being treated at the University Hospital of Tubingen, and remains in intensive care.

'They are taking excellent care of me and I'm doing very well,' Vogts said in German newspaper Bild.

'I have known for the last three or four months that I needed a new heart valve.'

Vogts was most recently in charge of Azerbaijan, but left after they failed to qualify for Euro 2016.

However, Vogts is eager to get back into the game once he has recovered, saying he is ready to take up a new role with an unnamed team.

'I will continue to work as a manager or director of sport,' he said. 'I was close to agreeing a contract and I'm looking forward to a new challenge.'
