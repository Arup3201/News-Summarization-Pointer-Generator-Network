Angel di Maria has revealed Cristiano Ronaldo played an important role in his decision to join Manchester United.

The pair played together at Real Madrid and Di Maria, who has excelled at Old Trafford following his £60million move, has revealed the former United winger was influential in his move.

‘Before we knew I was coming to Manchester, he told me it’s a massive club, I would be very happy here and it would be good for me’ said the Argentina star.

Di Maria, scoring in United's win over Everton, has already netted three goals in five matches for his new club 

‘At that time we didn’t know for sure that I was coming or not, so we didn’t go into great detail, but what he did say helped me greatly to make my decision.’

On his arrival at Old Trafford, Di Maria was handed the No 7 shirt worn by the likes of George Best, Bryan Robson, Eric Cantona, and of course, Ronaldo, who played almost 300 times for United. 

And the Argentine, who has scored three goals in five games since his arrival from Spain, has described wearing the iconic shirt as a 'source of motivation'.

'When you wear a shirt that’s been worn by the likes of David Beckham and Cristiano Ronaldo, it’s something you’re always going to be pleased about,' added Di Maria, who was speaking to United's website. 

'The fact that the club have chosen to give me that shirt number also gives me a huge confidence boost, so that’s why I’m very happy to have this number.'
