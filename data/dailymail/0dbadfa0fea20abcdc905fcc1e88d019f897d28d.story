Britain is storming ahead of all other
 major economies, with a new prediction for faster growth leading to 
claims the UK is now the 'Mo Farah of the global race'.

The
 International Monetary Fund said it now expects a 2.9 per cent rate of 
growth in 2014, a major u-turn after previously warning George Osborne 
his austerity programme was 'playing with fire'.

It
 means Britain is now on course to grow faster than any of the G7 
richest countries, including the US, Germany and France, leading to the 
comparison with Olympic gold medalist Farah.

The International Monetary Fund said the UK economy was on course to grow by 2.9 per cent this year, faster than any other G7 country

Chancellor George Osborne, on a visit to Brazil this week, is delighted to see Britain punching above its weight

Only a year ago, the IMF heavily 
criticised the Chancellor’s economic plans and said he was ‘playing with
 fire’ by pressing ahead with austerity policies. It cut its UK 
forecasts to 0.7 per cent for 2013 and 1.5 per cent for 2014.

But
 in a highly unusual mea culpa yesterday, its chief economist, Olivier 
Blanchard, admitted that the IMF’s earlier prediction was ‘too 
pessimistic’. He conceded that the UK economy grew by 1.8 per cent in 
2013 and raised growth forecasts to 2.9 per cent for 2014.

The
 latest World Economic Outlook gives its backing to policies 
pursued by the Chancellor and Bank of England governor Mark Carney.

It puts Britain ahead of the US 
on 2.8 per cent, Germany on 1.7 per cent and Canada at 2.3 per cent. The
 new figures also upgrade UK growth for next year though they still 
predict it will be slower than this year.

‘Consumption
 and residential investment looked like a rather unbalanced way of 
growing but I think forward-looking investment seems to be coming back 
and growth is going to be more balanced, so indeed that is very good 
news,’ Mr Blanchard said.

Charts in 
the IMF’s report suggest that US interest rates will start to rise in 
2015 and that those in Britain will not be far behind.

The
 bright forecast came as Britain’s Office for National Statistics 
produced data showing manufacturing rose strongly in February by 1 per 
cent, after losing some momentum in January because of the effect of 
heavy rain and flooding.

In a
 further boost, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research 
said total economic output grew by 0.9 per cent in the first three 
months of this year – the strongest performance since the second quarter
 of 2010.

The IMF forecast is a major vindication for Mr Osborne after being warned he was 'playing with fire'

Mr Osborne, who is on an export drive in Brazil, was clearly elated by the IMF projections.

'It is good news that the IMF forecasts
 that Britain is to grow faster and has been upgraded by them by more 
than any other Western economy this year, and that record numbers of 
jobs are being created,' he said.

‘It
 is proof that the economic plan is working. But we need to 
do more to get exports and investment going. That is what the Budget was
 all about and that is what I am doing in Brazil this week.

'And it 
is clear today that the growth deniers in the Labour Party are intent on
 talking down the British economy - and that is the greatest risk to 
recovery.'

Remarkably, the IMF believes that the main risk to its new forecast is that the UK will do even better than expected.

It
 expects the UK’s economic renaissance to continue into 2015, with gross
 domestic product – the total output of the economy – expected to power 
ahead by a further 2.5 per cent.

James Sproule, Chief Economist at the Institute of Directors, said: 'The IMF’s previous economic forecasts have been too pessimistic because they were convinced that cuts to state spending would have a serious negative effect on GDP growth. Fortunately for Britain, this fear has proved to be misplaced.'

And Ruth Porter, head of economic and social policy at Policy Exchange, said: 'Britain is now the Mo Farah of the global race.

'We are leading the rest of the developed world in terms of economic recovery but the race is a marathon not a sprint.

'The flexibility of our labour market has enabled us to weather the economic downturn better than most other countries. But the challenge now is to raise our ambition still further.'

But Labour's shadow chancellor Ed Balls said: 'These forecasts are welcome news after three damaging years when the economy flatlined and growth forecasts were repeatedly downgraded.

'Yet millions of working people, who are on average £1,600 a year worse off since 2010, are still not feeling any recovery at all.'

Official figures showed the economy grew by 0.7 per cent in the last three months of 2013, the fourth quarter of growth in a row.

Another estimate of UK GDP released today by the respected
think tank the National Institute for Economic and Social Research suggested
economic output grew by 0.9 per cent in the three months ending in March.

The
 NIESR said the robust growth was relatively broad based. It forecast 
economic growth for this year of 2.5 per cent and 2.1 per cent for 2015.

But it added that even though the level of economic output
had almost regained its pre-recession peak, a sizeable negative output gap
remains.

The pound surged again on the news, having already seen a boost today from strong official manufacturing figures. Sterling ticked higher versus the dollar to $1.675 - close to a 51-month high of $1.680 set in February - having opening London trading at just $1.661.

Remarkably, the IMF believes that the main risk to its forecast is that the UK will do even better than expected.

The Fund expects the UK’s economic 
renaissance to continue into 2015, the election year, with gross 
domestic product – the total output of the economy – expected to power 
ahead by a further 2.5 per cent.

The
 upbeat IMF assessment of Britain’s prospects will provide a boost to 
the Chancellor, who is due to arrive in Washington on Thursday.

The World Economic Outlook reports says: ‘Downside risks continue to dominate global growth outlook, notwithstanding some upside risks in the United States, the United Kingdom and Germany,’

The Fund says the main risks are from ‘low inflation and the possibility of protracted low growth especially in the euro area and Japan’.

Nevertheless, the IMF forecasts that the recovery from the Great Recession will continue across the globe this year with output strengthening from 3 per cent last year to 3.5 per cent in 2014 and 3.9 per cent in 2015.
