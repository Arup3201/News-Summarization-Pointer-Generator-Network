ED Miliband’s personal ratings are worse than those of Gordon Brown and he has ‘nothing to say’ about the issues voters care about such as immigration and welfare, senior Labour MPs are warning.

Mr Miliband is facing mounting unrest over an alleged ’35 per cent strategy’, which aims to deliver victory thanks to the votes of disaffected Liberal Democrats and Commons boundaries which favour Labour.

One unnamed ‘senior party staffer’ was yesterday said to have declared of Labour’s vanishing poll lead: ‘If we draw we still win.’

Ed Miliband's ratings are worse than those of Gordon Brown and he has 'nothing to say' on key issues, senior Labour MPs are warning

Labour jitters over its prospects at next year’s general election have been increased by two polls showing they have fallen behind the Conservatives for the first time for more than two years.

Mr Miliband yesterday sought to dismiss questions about his suitability to lead, insisting that he and his party were focusing ‘on the issues the country is facing’.

‘The cost of living crisis, how we create good jobs with good wages in this country, including with successful British industry, how we improve the NHS - that's where Labour's focus is and that's where it will remain,’ he insisted.

But he is being confronted with calls to toughen his messages on areas including immigration and welfare, where the Conservatives are seen as having outflanked Labour.

One former Labour minister told the Daily Mail: ‘Ed Miliband is comfortable talking about how bad business is and rent controls and the bedroom tax.

‘He has got nothing to say about the issues that public is concerned about. He doesn’t talk about immigration. He doesn’t talk about welfare. We’re about to go into a national election [for the European parliament] under his leadership and we are not going to win it.

‘It’s not inconceivable that we could end up coming third. That would be calamitous. MPs are in a tailspin. Plenty of them are panicking.

‘Ed Miliband has had four years and hasn’t managed to shift his personal ratings and public perception of him one iota. His numbers are catastrophic – worse than IDS [Iain Duncan Smith] or Gordon Brown. No-one has ever gone on to win an election with ratings as bad as this.’

The latest ICM poll puts Labour on just 31 per cent, the lowest level of support for an opposition party a year out from a general election

It is the first time the Tories have been ahead in the polls since before the disastrous 'omnishambles' budget in 2012

Labour MP Simon Danczuk said the two opinion polls showing the Tories back in the lead should serve as a ‘wake-up call’.

‘We’ve got some good policies - the energy price freeze, house-building, the jobs guarantee, cutting GP waiting times, helping those in the private rented sector - but we need to make sure people understand what they are,’ he said.

‘We have to make sure people understand what a Labour government will do for them. And we need people to believe what we are telling them.’

Mr Danczuk said Labour needed a strong economic message that it should ‘get out there in a clearer and sharper way’.

‘If we are to draw any positives from this, it’s good that its happened in 2014, twelve months before the election. One could argue the Tories are peaking too soon and we have time to get things moving in the right direction so it’s still all to play for.’

Labour's jitters over its prospects at next year's general election have grown, after two polls showed it had fallen behind the Tories for the first time in more than two years. But Mr Miliband yesterday insisted he and his party were focusing on 'the issues the country is facing'

Mark Ferguson, editor of the unofficial party website LabourList, said: ‘No-one can say that this hasn’t been coming through. Labour’s poll share has fallen from the relative comfort of the low forties and the high thirties to the uncomfortable territory of the mid-thirties, and now downwards into the low thirties – nearing the Gordon Brown zone.

‘If these dreadful polls achieve anything, I hope it’s to shake the party – politicians, staff and activists alike – out of the torpor which appears to have overcome it. Two years of poll leads have led to drift, a lack of energy and a deficit of imagination. These polls show that Labour cannot coast to victory – in fact, they show that defeat, and a painfully crushing one, is possible.’

Mr Ferguson attacked the ‘keep calm and carry on brigade’ who ‘note without concern that Labour could still have the most seats with only 32 per cent of the vote and a two-point Tory lead’.

He claimed one ‘senior party staffer’ had recently told him: ‘If we draw we still win’. Mr Ferguson condemned that attitude as ‘complacent beyond belief’.

Conservative chairman Grant Shapps said: ‘Ed Miliband’s calculated political gimmicks all show the same thing. Labour hasn’t changed. They haven’t learned. They would crash our economy all over again, because they still want the high spending, borrowing and taxes that brought Britain to its knees.”

‘It is only by sticking with David Cameron and the Government’s long-term economic plan that we can ensure a more secure future for Britain, and for our children.’

A spokesman for Mr Miliband said: ‘This is a four-party dynamic. We have been talking about welfare and immigration and we will have more to say about Ukip and the reforms we want to see in Europe.

‘A 35 per cent strategy never existed. I have never heard anybody mention it. We want to win as many votes as possible.’
