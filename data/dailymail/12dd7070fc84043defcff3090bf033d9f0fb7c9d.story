A 12-year-old boy with terminal cancer has given up his fight and decided he would rather spend what remains of his life at home with his family.

Alex Rodriguez, 12, from Bedford County, Nashville, was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer - rhabdomysarcoma - when he was seven after he started suffering from a terrible backache.

Rhabdomyosarcoma is a cancerous tumor of the muscles that are attached to the bones. It can occur in many places in the body and is very rare in children.

Although the cancer went away once, it has since returned and after grueling treatments - including chemotherapy, radiotherapy and even spinal surgery - he made the grown-up decision that no boy his age should have to.

He made the decision to stay home and be near family and friends instead of continuing treatment at a facility in Texas.

Alex knows his days are nearing an end because just over two years ago, he was given three years to live.

Harris Middle School, where he was a student, is rallying around Alex to try to raise money to enable the 12-year-old to do the things he's always wanted to in the last stage of his life.

They have started selling blue ribbons - his favourite colour - for 50 cents to help his family.

Speaking to WKRN-TV, Alex said: 'I'm really glad to know that they want to support me and are in this with me.'

Grandmother: Carolyn Camacho said she will be glad to get Alex home so she can see him every day and put her arms around him

His grandmother Carolyn Camacho said: 'No matter what he's been through, he's always smiling and got those dimples showing, always.

'They found out that night when he was seven years old what was going on.

'The hospital asked Alex what he wanted to do. He said he didn't want to take more treatments, they didn't do any good before, they didn't work, and he doesn't want to be away from home.'

His big sister Kimberly Leverette, 21, said she is proud of how strong her brother is being and that he is even handling it better than a lot of people in the family.

She said: 'There are times we break down and he doesn't.'

Principal, Dr Tracy Lampley told the new site: 'It must be an incredibly difficult thing to think about as a 12-year-old, I have a certain amount of time left, so what would the things be I've always wanted to do?

'We are just giving him every opportunity to enjoy, enjoy every moment.'

Mrs Camacho said they are now preparing to have hospice care set up in her home. She said that being with him was the most important thing.

'Getting to see him every day and being with him, hold him and hug him, that's all that matters', she said.
