With certain sports, seeing a major brawl is part and parcel of the game.

But its not something you expect to see in baseball. However, two college teams decided to change all that by having a fight involving almost every player on the pitch.

The all-in brawl took place during the first match of the college baseball season between UC Riverside and Sacramento State.

Brawl: Players from both teams rushed in to join in the fight, with mini scuffles breaking out everywhere

The fight began in the third inning when Riverside player Eddie Young was tagged out between the second and third base by Sacramento State’s Andrew Ayers

Cameras captured the two players scuffling before Young launched a huge punch to Ayers' face.

This led to players from each team charging in, resulting in even more fights breaking out.

As reported by CBS News, players even ran from the dugouts to join in the brawl, with the umpires powerless to stop the fighting.

Help: The huge punch led to players running over to help out their team mates

Nasty: As the players brawled on the floor, the umpires struggled to separate them

Speaking to The State Hornet, Sacramento State head coach Reggie Christiansen said the players had collided during the rundown play. He said: 'Ayers reacted the way he should have. I didn’t think he did anything wrong and Riverside retaliated. Unfortunately, it turned out to be a little bit of a melee, but that’s baseball; it happens sometimes.'

Eventually, once the brawl was over the umpires ejected three UC Riverside players and one Sacramento player.

The match was able to continue and, despite having three players ejected, Riverside won the game 2-1.

Both Young and Ayers were handed a four game suspension for their part in the brawl.
