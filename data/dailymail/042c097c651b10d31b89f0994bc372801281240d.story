A fire that broke out at Stoke Mandeville Hospital last night caused 53 patients to flee for safety.

Patients were evacuated as quickly as possibly to other areas of the hospital in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, but three still had to be treated for smoke inhalation.

A total of forty firefighters were called to the hospital at 4.30am this morning after the blaze broke out on a ward.

Frightening: Patients had to be evacuated from Stoke Mandeville Hospital when a fire broke out in the night

The fire brigade were only able to start leaving the scene at 7am.

Group manager Neil Boustred from Buckinghamshire Fire and Rescue Service said: 'Crews were faced with a fire on the second floor of the hospital. They tackled the fire within very hot, arduous conditions'.

Crews from Aylesbury, Great Missenden, Princes Risborough, Waddesdon and High Wycombe were all called to the scene.

All staff and patients are now safe, while those who were treated for the effects of breathing in smoke were not seriously affected.

Buckinghamshire Fire and Rescue Service said the ward had suffered massive smoke damage and also some fire damage.

Investigation: The cause of the fire that damaged three wards at the hospital is still unknown

Two other wards, and the remainder of the second floor, were also affected by smoke damage.

A Buckinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust spokesman said: 'We have been contacting patients' relatives throughout the morning and ask that, where possible, visitors to the wards affected (four, five, seven) refrain from coming to the hospital.'

Stoke Mandeville's Accident and Emergency department is currently running a reduced service.

The cause of the fire is being investigated by the trust and the fire service.
