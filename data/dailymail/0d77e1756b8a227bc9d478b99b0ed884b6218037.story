Matthew Geater, 20, worked at three separate chains of the Chinese takeaway Hotcha, in Bristol, before being dismissed via Facebook messenger

A takeaway deliver driver has been left jobless after his bosses allegedly sacked him out of the blue via Facebook.

Matthew Geater, 20, worked at three separate chains of the Chinese takeaway Hotcha, in Bristol, often notching up 60 hours a week.

However, the driver was dismissed from the firm this week with no warning after bosses claimed he failed to turn up for work and had 'attitude'.

Mr Geater, who was on a zero hours contract which stated that both parties had to give a week's notice of dismissal, has now been left furious over the way the incident was handled.

The only exceptions for him to be given instant dismissal, as stated in his contract, are that of employee misconduct, incompetence or negligence – but he claims he did nothing wrong.

He was told that he was being sacked on Facebook messenger, despite never having had a written warning or a complaint against him.

Now unemployed, Mr Geater said: 'Firing someone over social media is completely unacceptable to me. It came completely out of the blue, when I was not expecting it, and it is so impersonal.

'I had a good experience of working there and got on with the regional manager.

'I had only been working on Gloucester Road for a week when the manager of that shop told me I was fired.

'I think it was wrong of him - doing it over social media was unprofessional and the least I would have expected is a phone call, or a quick face-to-face chat.

'I don't want anyone else to have this happen to them. It is a horrible thing to pop up when you are just browsing the internet.

'When I first saw the message come through I was in total shock, I almost fell over. I had just been talking to a friend and then this came through.

'The manager didn't even tell me himself, he got someone else to do it. I just can't believe it.'

Mr Geater began working at the city's Kingswood branch of the takeaway earlier this year before moving to the Yate outlet four months later in the hope of receiving more hours.

However, after realising he was not getting enough work to cover his petrol, he moved to a third outlet in Bristol City Centre where he was promised permanent work.

But just four days into the role, Matthew received a private message on Facebook from the trainee manager, telling him the district manager had decided to sack him.

The message read: 'I don't no (sic) what has gone on in the other shops but unfortunately you have now been fired from Hotcha.

'Thanks for working for me but there is nothing I can do...you have been fired due to not turning up and your attitude.'

Mr Geater worked at three different branches of Chinese takeaway Hotcha in Bristol (one of which is pictured above) before he was dismissed over Facebook messenger for 'failing to turn up to work' and for his 'attitude'

He was told that he was no longer entitled to work at the branch as he had been dismissed from earlier jobs with the company for failing to turn up to work.

But Mr Geater claims this was not the case and that he had been unfairly dismissed by Hotcha.

He said: 'They said that it was because I hadn't turned up to work, but that just isn't true.

'I had a couple of days off for personal grievances and there was another occasion when I had a flat tyre.

'I gave them plenty of notices on both occasions and they were fine with it, they were very supportive.

'I really don't think this is fair and I will battle to make sure this happens to no one else.'

His mother, Claire Longman, added: 'I think it is a disgusting, rude way to treat an employee.

'Matthew has always let the company know when he can't work, and them sacking him like this violates his contract.'

A spokesman from Hotcha said: 'We are sorry that Mr Geater feels that he has been treated unfairly. 

'He did make contact with our head office last Thursday about his grievance and since then we have been attempting to resolve his complaint. 

'Hotcha takes any complaint from its employees extremely seriously and would never use Facebook as an appropriate medium to inform a member of staff that they are no longer required. 

'We have been trying to contact Mr Geater to clarify who sent the message informing him of his employment status. 

'If the message was sent on behalf of Hotcha, this matter will be treated very seriously and thoroughly investigated.'
