A woman who was nearly paralysed in a freak horse riding accident has made an incredible recovery to become a weight lifting champion.

Georgina Hodson, 27, was warned she may never walk again after she suffered a head on collision with a tree while riding her horse.

Mrs Hodson, from Market Drayton, in Shropshire, was lucky not to have damaged her spine in the accident.

She said: ‘I had a freak accident and there was a very real chance I had seriously damaged my vertebra - the doctors thought I may have been paralysed.

‘I had to have 75 stitches in my forehead and my nose had been smashed off my face.’

As part of her slow recovery from the accident in 2007, Mrs Hodson - who is just 5ft 2ins - began doing gentle exercises in the gym and then slowly progressed onto weights to build up her strength.

She said: ‘I'm not only physically strong, I have an emotional strength which has driven me forward and has helped me through my recovery.

‘At school I had always been picked on for being little- I used to get called "squirt" because I am so small, but when I started power lifting and training I felt empowered and I realised I can be strong.’

Mrs Hodson started power lifting properly this year and has just broken a British record by lifting 11st, despite only weighing 7st 7lbs herself.

Mrs Hodson broke her nose and cracked her head open when she crashed into a tree while riding her horse. She also damaged several vertebrae and doctors initially feared she might be paralysed

She said: ‘I actually managed to do something that no other woman in my weight class in Britain has done before.

‘I managed a 67.5kg squat, but I then decided I would try and break my own record and managed to lift 70kg.’

Mrs Hodson trains hard with her personal trainer husband, David, but also finds time to pamper herself.

After her accident, Mrs Hodson started going to the gym to rebuild her strength and as she recovered she started to try weight lifting

Mrs Hodson, who was bullied at school because of her height, said: ‘I'm not only physically strong, I
 have an emotional strength which has driven me forward and has helped 
me through my recovery'

Mrs Hodson says she is proof that women can be weight lifters without losing their femininity

She said: ‘The human body is an incredible thing and I am very pleased to still consider myself very feminine despite being stronger than some men.

‘Women shouldn't think they can't be strong or if they use weights they will look manly or bulky - that is simply not the case.

‘I am proof that you can be feminine and strong at the same time.’

The psychologist now has her sights set on competing at next year's power lifting world championships in Canada.

Mrs Hodson (pictured as a child) said: 'When I compete it is just me against the weight and that is what I like. There is no hiding'

She said: ‘When I compete it is just me against the weight and that is what I like. There is no hiding.’

Her husband and trainer, David Hodson, said: ‘When I first met Georgie I could not believe someone could be so brave and graceful in the face of what she has had to go through.

‘She started out with only a small part of the physical strength she has now but she always had a tremendous amount of emotional strength which has pushed her forward.’

Mrs Hodson added: ‘After the accident I was in a really bad way, but since I have starting building up my strength I have never felt so empowered and positive.’
