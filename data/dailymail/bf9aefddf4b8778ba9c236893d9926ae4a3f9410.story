A topless painting of the late actress Bea Arthur - famous for her role as Dorothy in the TV show ‘Golden Girls’ – sold for nearly $2 million at a Christie’s auction in New York on Wednesday night.

Controversial artist John Currin painted ‘Bea Arthur Naked’ in 1991, it features the elderly star wearing a blank expression and sagging breasts.

Arthur never actually sat for Currin, who derived the work from a photograph of the actress with her clothes on.

Sexist or empowering? John Curran's 1991 painting 'Bea Arthur Naked' has fetched $1.9m at auction

The oil on canvas painting was purchased by an anonymous phone bidder for $1.9 million.

There had been expectations the painting might fetch as much as $2.5 million in the post-war and contemporary art sale at Christie's.

After the painting was unveiled in the early 90s, it was described as sexist and misogynist by critics.

Others have since argued it is actually a feminist statement about confidence and age. A Christie’s spokesman called the painting 'visually lasting.'

During her career, Arthur won acclaim for her comic timing and deadpan delivery in roles such as Maude, right

'It’s historically significant - it’s 
radical to sexualize someone people think of as asexual,' spokesman Koji
 Inoue told The New York Post.

Currin’s work is now widely acclaimed and hangs in museums such as the Whitney. He once said he considered Arthur 'more of a maternal figure than a feminist icon. I watched "Maude" all the time when I was a kid. She's a genius. She's funny because she's so much smarter than everyone around her.'

Arthur, famous for her Emmy-winning roles in the 1970s and '80s television series ‘Maude’ and ‘The Golden Girls,’ died of cancer in 2009 at age 86.

Born Beatrice Frankel in New York on May 13, 1922, Arthur began 
performing in college and appeared in Broadway and off-Broadway roles, 
winning a Tony Award opposite Angela Lansbury in Mame.

In the 
early 1970s, she appeared on the groundbreaking television comedy 
'All in the Family' as Edith Bunker's fiercely liberal cousin Maude. 
Producers who saw gold in her comic timing and deadpan delivery quickly devised a spinoff for the 
character.

Maude debuted on CBS in 1972 and became one of the top-rated sitcoms on U.S. television during its six-year run.

In
 a two-part episode that aired in November 1972, the show stirred 
protest and controversy when Maude decided to have an abortion because 
of her age. The procedure was legal in New York state, where the show 
was set, but not nationwide.

Two months later, the U.S. Supreme Court legalized abortion in its landmark Roe v. Wade decision.

Arthur followed with Golden Girls, an unlikely hit from 1985 to 1992 that featured four female retirees living together.
