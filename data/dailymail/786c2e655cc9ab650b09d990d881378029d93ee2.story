Aston Villa captain Ron Vlaar has played down talk of a move to Manchester United after claiming they would have contacted him if they were interested.

Vlaar was a mainstay in Holland's defence under United manager Louis van Gaal at the World Cup in Brazil, prompting speculation that the pair could be reunited at Old Trafford.

However, despite United's continuing problems at the back, 29-year-old Vlaar insists there has been no contact between himself and the club with the January transfer window about to open.

Speaking to Dutch newspaper Algemeen Dagblad, he said: 'I've never heard from them. If a club had really wanted me, I would have noticed. That has not been the case.'

The Holland international was also publicly courted by Southampton manager Ronald Koeman in the summer - much to the annoyance of Villa boss Paul Lambert who has since insisted that none of his star players will be allowed to leave in January.

‘They’ll (Vlaar and Fabian Delph) not go anywhere in January,’ said Lambert. ‘It’s my say. The way January works, if somebody’s worth something you may as well put another 15 zeroes on the end of it. Price is inflated. 

'Even if anybody came in you would never let them go cheap or anything like that.’ 

Asked if any sum could prise either player away, the Villa manager said: ‘Nothing, no.’

United are understood to be interested in Mats Hummels, although a January deal is unlikely

United's defence has been beset by injuries this season with Phil Jones, Chris Smalling, Jonny Evans and Marcos Rojo all being sidelined - forcing Van Gaal to put his faith in inexperienced youngsters like Tyler Blackett and Paddy McNair.

The Red Devils are prepared to spend in January, although primary targets such as Borussia Dortmund's Mats Hummels are unlikely to be available until next season. 

Vlaar arrived at Villa Park from Feyenoord for £3.2million in 2012 and has made 76 appearances for the club.
