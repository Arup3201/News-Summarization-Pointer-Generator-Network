Sony says it will release the Seth Rogen-James Franco comedy 'The Interview' mere days after it announced the film would not in theaters for its scheduled Christmas release date.

Sony cancelled the film's release last week after the hackers threatened real-world attacks on cinemas screening it.

'Sony only delayed this,' said company attorney David Boies on today's NBC's Meet the Press.

Sony says it will in fact publicly release the Seth Rogen-James Franco comedy 'The Interview' despite threats from hackers

'Sony only delayed this,' said company attorney David Boies on NBC's Meet the Press.

President Obama later said Sony had made a mistake in cancelling the movie, and that he would have intervened to make sure it went ahead.

The hackers leaked embarrassing emails between Sony Pictures co-chair Amy Pascal and producer Scott Rudin joking in a racially insensitive manner about Obama's film tastes.

'Sony has been fighting to get this picture distributed,' he said, according to The Daily Beast. 'It will be distributed.' 

The vast majority of cinema chains which were set to screen the movie pulled it after the threats.

That came after a series of embarrassing internal documents were made public, from plans for the upcoming James Bond film, to internal emails arguing over the company's direction, to discussion of past theatrical failures.  

Pascal has been especially embarrassed by the leaks, recently having emails released revealing that things are so bad between the actor and the studio in fact that Sony head Amy Pascal calls him an 'a**hole* not once, but twice in emails exchanges.

Actress Angelina Jolie was also ripped in some of the email exchanges with Amy Pascal, seen here together at a  Women in Entertainment Breakfast in L.A.

She also believed Idris Elba should be cast as the next James Bond.

Meanwhile Angelina Jolie was referred to as a 'a minimally talented spoiled brat' in one exchange discussing the star's passion project remake of Cleopatra.  

Boies called the hacks 'a state sponsored criminal attack on an American corporation and its employees.

Sony has been glad for the FBI's help in investigating the hack, and 'the rest of the government has got to get behind it and has got to figure out a way that we can protect our national security.'

As Vox notes, one viable option to get the movie out would be Crackle, the streaming service that Sony already owns.  

However, Boies was unsure how viewers would finally be able to see the film.

'How it's going to be distributed, I don't think anybody knows quite yet,' he said. 'But it's going to be distributed.'

Just this weekend, North Korea threatened more attacks against the U.S. government and other American institutions in the wake of the hack on Sony which cancelled the release of The Interview.

Obama also announced there was consideration to put the rogue state back on the list of state sponsors of terrorism. 

The government - which was outraged by the film showing the assassination of leader Kim Jong Un - also claimed to have 'clear evidence' that the U.S. government engineered the project as a 'propaganda' attack against North Korea.

In a ranting post published by the state news agency KCNA, Korean authorities hit back in an escalating war of words in which they say they will 'blow up' the White House - while bizarrely continuing to deny they have anything to do with the cyber attacks on Sony. 

North Korea called the hack a 'righteous deed' - and reiterated that it 'highly esteems' the attack - but said it had no idea where it came from.
