The New Year’s Honours list is packed with celebrities, top dignitaries and household names.

But one you might not have heard of is Chris Bates, who has been awarded an MBE for his services to the world’s most remote inhabited island.

The 66-year-old has been recognised for his work as the UK representative of Tristan da Cunha, a tiny island in the South Atlantic with a population of 267.

Chris Bates, who has been awarded an MBE for his services to the world’s most remote inhabited island, Tristan da Cunha

The 66-year-old has been recognised for his work as the UK representative of Tristan da Cunha, a tiny island in the South Atlantic with a population of 267

Lying midway between Africa and South America, the island is a British overseas territory and can only be reached by a week-long boat journey from Cape Town.

Mr Bates, a former journalist, first heard of the island while working as a press officer in 1995.

He took up his role as ‘voice of the people’ seven years ago.

He carried out his duties from his home in Birmingham, often arranging for items such as bus stop signs and gravestones to be delivered to the remote outpost.

'The great advantage Tristan has got is that it is so different to anywhere else on the planet and has a unique philosophy and way of life,' he said.

'There is nowhere as remote so it grabs people's attention and if you're dealing with a Government minister it catches their interest.

'I have travelled back and forwards to London three times a week to various meetings and it's effectively been a full-time job.

'I'm supposed to be retired and when I started I asked my wife if I could do it because I was meant to be a house husband.

'I've met everyone in the Cabinet including the Prime Minister and most of the other Government ministers over the years.

'I often took things like bus stops signs, wrapped in brown paper, down to the Post Office to send over to the island.

'The requests were as varied as supplying dog whistles for shepherds, souvenir badges, silk ties and police badges.'  

He also represented the island at state events in London and at conferences around the world.

Mr Bates, who lives with his wife Julie, 53, stepped down from the role this week, but the island’s administrator Alex Mitham said he leaves Tristan da Cunha ‘in a stronger position on the world stage’. 

Tristan da Cunha is the name of the main island in a remote group of volcanic islands with the same name in the South Atlantic Ocean.

It is the most remote inhabited island in the world - lying 1,243 miles (2,000km) from the nearest inhabited land Saint Helena and 1,491 miles (2,400km) from the nearest continental land South Africa.

Tristan da Cunha - known by locals as Tristan - has a north to south length of just seven miles (11.3km) and has an area of 37.8 square miles (98 sq km)

The island is part of the British overseas territory which includes Saint Helena and Ascension thousands of miles to its north.

At one time Tristan was on the main trading route between Europe and the Indian Ocean, but the small community living there is now extremely isolated.

It was discovered in 1506 but remained uninhabited until it was used by US whalers in the late 1700s.

The British navy stationed a garrison there during Napoleon's exile on St Helena and, when it was withdrawn, three men stayed behind and became the founders of the present settlement.
