A U.S. soldier returning home with her pets on a United Airlines flight says her dog riding in their PetSafe programme had to be euthanized after suffering a heat stroke while in the airline's care.

Seven-year army veteran Rachel Estes, 35, says it was while she and her 5-year-old daughter were returning to North Carolina from South Korea when her 14-pound terrier named Livi got fatally lost in the transit.

She says the family's two cats, also travelling with them, arrived in Charlotte a day after the family's arrival, but Livi wasn't there.

Killed: A woman flying to the U.S. with her dog Livi, pictured, says veterinarians had to put the pet down after he suffered a heat stroke while in transit with United Airlines' pet care programme

Instead they got a phone call - after four hours of searching for the dog by the PetSafe transportation programme - to say Livi was in Houston, Texas and would be taken to a veterinary clinic instead.

'It took us trying to find [the animals] to even find out that they took the dog to the vet,' Mrs Estes told the Houston Chronicle.

Found collapsed in her carrier, according to the dog's medical record, and tangled up in her harness, a veterinarian ruled that Livi had died of a heat stroke.

'She came in with a fever of 108 and was unresponsive,' Mrs Estes said the veterinarian told her.

Tragic end: The dog was rescued from a shelter in South Korea by the Army mom before she said he was lost in transit and when found in Houston, Texas, was unresponsive

Responding to the incident, United Airlines has said in a statement that it wasn't responsible for the dog's death.

'We carefully reviewed the details surrounding this incident, and the veterinarian's examination of Ms. Estes' dog showed that the death of the dog was not transit related,' a statement obtained by the Chronicle read.

The airline said they would reimburse Mrs Estes for the cost of transporting all three pets.

No fault: United Airlines has decided that the dog's death was not transit related and had no fault in the situation, while offering to reimburse the woman for her pets' transportation

'My dog had to have been so scared and I wasn't there to hold her little paw,' Mrs Estes said of her largest concern over the issue.

She said her dog had been rescued from a South Korea animal shelter on the Osan Air Force base.

After her seven years of service, she was discharged and returning to the U.S. with her daughter while her husband, also in the military service, spends his last year abroad before joining them.
