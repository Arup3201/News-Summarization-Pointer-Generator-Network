Harry Redknapp will have to deal in the loan market in January as he looks to bring in reinforcements at Loftus Road.

The QPR manager travelled to Malaysia during the week for a meeting with owner Tony Fernandes, flying out on Wednesday evening and returning early on Friday.

Head of football operations Les Ferdinand and Chris Ramsey from the club's academy also joined the group to discuss all things related to the club - but, if Redknapp was hoping to come back with news of a transfer window kitty, he would have been sorely disappointed.

Having overseen the signings of 10 players ahead of the closure of the summer window, Redknapp has been unable to keep the newly-promoted R's out of the relegation zone - they currently reside in 18th place in the Barclays Premier League.

Many teams are expected to be shopping around to bolster their squads in the new year but the 67-year-old admits he will only be looking for temporary moves.

'It was good,' he said of his Far-East chat with Fernandes.

'I went over to see Tony and Ruben (Emir Gnanalingam) - two of the owners. We had a good, positive meeting talking about players, new stadium, training ground. It was well worth going.

'He's busy so I went over... we just discussed lots of different aspects of the club. We had a good day. It was interesting.

'We're not looking to spend. If there's a loan or two out there we would be interested, that's where we are at. We spent some money in the summer, so we're not that far short.

'Hopefully we can find another striker to add to the ones we've got already, so that's an area we are looking at.

'In January it's always difficult to find players. We will see. There will be someone out there that can come and help us.'

Redknapp moved to rule out two potential swoops, as he poured cold water on reports he was looking to link up with Peter Crouch or Jermain Defoe once again.

'Mark (Hughes, Stoke boss) says they are looking to give him a new contract,' he said of Crouch.

'He belongs to Stoke and we've never discussed that with them. He's a good player. He belongs to Stoke and they want to keep him, so that's not a goer really. Defoe is an excellent player but I don't know if he fits in our budget.'

A 3-1 defeat at Everton on Monday night means QPR have not picked up a point away from home this season but they have looked strong at Loftus Road and will fancy their chances against fellow relegation candidates West Brom on Saturday.

Top goalscorer Charlie Austin returns from suspension and defender Steven Caulker is also back having also sat out the loss at Goodison Park following the head injury he suffered at the players' Christmas gathering.

But Redknapp will have to make do without Juventus loanee Mauricio Isla, with the defender returning to his native Chile to be present at the birth of his child.

Redknapp is not hopeful of concluding a deal to bring Jermain Defoe back to England from Toronto FC
