Dogs are not just man's best friend.

After just 10 days of being apart from one another (although that may be longer in dog years) Jasper the cat pounces on her canine companion Bow-Z and keeps on hugging him, and hugging him....and hugging him.

YouTube user joshbouz posted the heart melting video online back in 2012 and since then it has racked up over 6 million views.

Is it really you?: Jasper the cat stares lovingly at her best dog friend Bow-Z before giving him the hug of a lifetime (for a lifetime)

Where have you been?: Jasper the cat hasn't seen Bow-Z in 10 days so she jumps up to give him a hug 

Still hugging: Jasper can't take her tiny paws off of Bow-Z's neck because she misses him so much 

As soon as Jasper catches a glimpse of Bow-Z she can't help but wrap her tiny arms around his neck.

'Meow,' Jasper exclaims several times as if to say, 'I missed you so much. How could you ever leave me?' 

When her tiny claws fail her and she falls off her furry friend's neck, she resiliently goes up to give him another very long hug.

Bow-Z who is less emotive than his feline companion wags his tail silently and walks into the next room.

Not letting him out of her sight, Jasper follows Bow-Z as he walks away and continues to jump on him for more hugs.

No hug back?: Japser continues to hug Bow-Z as he wags his tail silently, perhaps too overcome with emotion to let out a single woof 

Don't leave again!: As Bow-Z walks into the next room, Jasper keeps a tight grip on him as she doesn't let him out of her sight
