It's been a tough six months for oil tycoon Harold Hamm: Not only did he sign away $975 million to his ex-wife following a bitter divorce battle, but he also lost half of his billion-dollar fortune.

Hamm's company, Continental Resources Inc., has lost $9.2billion since June 2014, slicing his $18.5 billion net worth in half.

A judge ruled in November that Oklahoma native Hamm, 69, also owed his former wife, Sue Ann Arnall nearly $1 billion in a divorce settlement and earlier this month cut her a handwritten check for the entire amount.

Oil tycoon Harold Hamm, pictured with his wife Sue Ann Arnall in 2012, has lost half his billion-dollar fortune to divorce and falling oil prices in the past six months

Hamm's company, Continental Resources Inc, has lost have its value in six months since June 2014 due to falling oil prices 

In November, an Oklahoma court ordered the CEO to pay his ex-wife close to $1 billion in cash and assets when the couple divorced after a 26-year marriage.

And despite the fact she cashed the check, Ms Arnall, 56, has said she is still planning an appeal.

At the Oklahoma Supreme Court, she claimed that the earlier ruling allowed Hamm to keep the vast majority of a marital estate.

'I will not dismiss my appeal and do not feel that my right to appeal should be denied because I have accepted, in the interim, a small portion of the estate that we built over more than two decades,' Arnall said in a statement through her lawyers. 

The couple never signed a prenuptial agreement.

Continental has said the divorce award, one of the largest in U.S. history, has no impact on its business or operations. 

'As we have said all along, there will be no change of control in the company,' said spokeswoman Kristin Thomas. 

The Hamm divorce has been ongoing since 2012 and last month, Hamm pledged to appeal the decision, after a sharp fall in oil prices cut billions from his personal fortune. 

Last week, Continental Resources Inc said that Hamm had pledged about one-fourth of the company shares he owns as collateral for a personal loan, according to a regulatory filing.

The shares Hamm posted as collateral are worth $2.6 billion and represent an 18.5 per cent chunk in the Oklahoma-based drilling giant.

Hamm could be forced to offer more collateral for the loan if the value of his company falls again. 

Hamm pledged 68.7 million of his Continental shares as collateral for a personal loan on January 9, according to a January 13 Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing. 

Harold Hamm penned this check to his ex-wife last month for $974.8 million following their two-year divorce battle in Oklahoma

The document did not state the purpose nor the terms of the loan, how much Hamm borrowed or who lent him the money.

Hamm will need to pledge additional shares if the price of Continental stock falls below the 'minimum value requirements' of the loan, the company said without offering specifics.

Hamm owns nearly 253 million shares, or 68 per cent of his firm. He will keep voting rights over the shares posted as collateral, the firm said.  

Hamm's personal borrowing won't damage the company or other shareholders unless Continental shares continue to fall sharply on lower oil prices, said one energy analyst. The shares have lost more than half of their value over the last four months.

'An issue could arise at some point,' said Leo Mariani of RBC Capital Markets in New York. 

'If oil prices fall he would have to pledge a much greater portion of his company. He could lose those shares and they could be sold at depressed prices.'

Along with her multimillion-dollar settleent, Ms Arnell was awarded the couple's second Oklahoma home located in Nichols Hill and worth $4.6million

Ms Arnall picked up three properties in the divorce, including the family home in Enid, Oklahoma

That risk is low, Mariani said, because oil prices are unlikely to fall much further or to remain low for years. U.S. benchmark crude oil has been trading below $50 a barrel, down from around $100 a barrel six months ago. 

Hamm had humble beginnings, growing up in rural Oklahoma where he was the 13th child of Oklahoma cotton sharecroppers.

He founded Continental in 1967.  

He has already paid his former wife more than $20 million during the divorce proceedings.

Ms Arnall has taken ownership of the Oak Ridge Ranch in Carmel, California, a property purchased by the couple in 2011 for $14.7million, along with the couple's two of their Oklahoma properties, as per the court's ruling.

Hamm will take their $750,000 home in Branson, Missouri and a $300,000 log cabin that sits on 154 acres in Major County, Oklahoma.
