Egypt's President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi said he wishes Peter Greste was deported back to Australia before being jailed

Egyptian president Abdel Fattah al-Sisi has spoken out about how he wished jailed Australian journalist Peter Greste had been deported home instead of being tried because of the damage the case has caused the African nation.

Greste and his two Al Jazeera colleagues were sentenced to between seven and 10 years for allegedly defaming Egypt and aiding banned Islamists. The verdict sparked international outcry and condemnation of the north African country, and now the president of the country, who man called to intervene on the ruling, has finally conceded it has had a 'negative' impact on Egypt.

During a roundtable on Sunday, the president said the June 23 verdict has had a "very negative effect" on Egypt, the Sydney Morning Herald has reported

Egypt's mass circulation daily Al-Masry Al-Youm  quoted the president saying: 'I wish they were deported after their arrest, instead of being put on trial,' he said.

But despite his comments he has denied the Greste family and the Australian Government their wishes of a presidential pardon, saying local authorities 'will not interfere in judicial matters'.

Humans rights groups and Governments from the US and Australia have been particularly vocal in their opposition to the jailing of Greste and the journalists.

Washington described the sentencing as 'draconian' and called on Mr Sisi to release them, while the United Nations said imprisoning them was 'obscene'.

Australian Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop said after the sentencing that the government was in shock. ‘We are deeply dismayed by the fact that a sentence has been imposed and we are appalled by the severity of it.'

The family of Peter Greste, including his two brothers, have been in close contact with him.

Greste and two other journalist - Canadian-Egyptian Mohamed Fahmy and Egyptian Baher Mohamed - were arrested inside their office on December 29

They have continually denied the accusations leveled against them, saying they were just doing their job.

The family of Peter had previously said that appealing for a presidential pardon was one of the first things they would consider in the campaign to free him. But with that no longer a prospect, the Greste's must now decide whether to lodge an appeal with the same judiciary that convicted him
