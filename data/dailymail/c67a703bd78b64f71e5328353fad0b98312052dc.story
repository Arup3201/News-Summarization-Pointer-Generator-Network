Ever been so desperate for a sip of tea that you misjudge the temperature and burn your tongue?

One company is hoping to put an end to the common mishap with their latest invention: Smart Mug.

Smart Mug determines the temperature
of the liquid inside the mug and uses a light to indicate the right time to start 
enjoying your favourite beverage.

The smart mug aims to provide drinkers with a quick and easy way to 
tell whether the beverage they are about to consume is still too hot, 
now too cold, or just right for optimal enjoyment.

Now that's handy! Smart Mug determines the temperature of the liquid inside the mug and uses a light to indicate the right time to start enjoying your favourite beverage

The mug has illustrations of a tea bag and coffee beans to indicate the temperature at which each drink is best consumed.

There are six light indicators - indicating too high, ideal and lower temperatures.

Smart Mug is the brainchild of UK-based designer Evita Krumina and is dishwasher safe.

The mug is thermoelectric, which means it draws its power from the change in temperature and therefore requires no cords or batteries. It has a life of up to ten years.

Entrepreneurial: Smart Mug, which is the brainchild of UK-based designer Evita Krumina, is pledging for money on Kickstarter

Writing about the scientific device on Kickstarter, a site where creatives pledge for funds to launch their concepts, the team behind Smart Mug said: 'We have conducted extensive research and concluded that hot beverages such as tea, coffee, hot chocolate and others are frequently served at temperatures between 70⁰ C (158⁰ F) and 85⁰ C (185⁰ F).

'Brief exposures to liquids in these temperatures can cause scalds.

'We have thought about ways of measuring the temperature of the beverage consumed at home or office, without the need of any additional attributes. Eventually we came up with an idea of Smart Mug, powered by innovative elements and based on beautiful minimalist design.'

There's never been a better time to put the kettle on.

Careful! The mug has illustrations of a tea bag and coffee beans to indicate the average preferred temperature for each drink to help you avoid scalding your mouth
