The first Ebola drug trial in Africa has started with three healthcare workers in Mali receiving an experimental vaccine.

It comes as the World Health Organisation (WHO) today warned the virus is now 'entrenched' in the capital cities of the three worst-hit countries, and is accelerating in almost all settings. 

The trial started on October 8, with the first health worker receiving the drug, followed by two colleagues yesterday.

Over the course of the trial 37 more healthcare workers will be given the vaccine.

It is the latest vaccine to be rushed into clinical trials as the worst-ever Ebola outbreak grips West Africa.

The WHO said the disease has so far claimed the lives of more than 3,800 people, infecting at least 8,000 people in West Africa.   

The organisation's deputy head Bruce Aylward warned that the world's response is not keeping up with the disease in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone - the three worst-hit nations.  

Yesterday African leaders chided the international community  for its slow response to the epidemic and appealed to the world to turn promises of aid into action on the ground.

In emotional appeals to a high-level meeting of major donors gathered at the World Bank, the leaders of  Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia, said they needed everything from treatment centres to healthcare workers, equipment and funding.

Professor Myron Levine, from the University of Maryland School of Medicine, who helped developed the experimental drug, said if successful the trial 'could alter the dynamic' of the current outbreak.

While the university's dean Albert Reece, said the research 'will play a key role in helping solve' the crisis. 

Sierra Leone's President Ernest Koroma told the meeting in Washington via video conference: 'Our people are dying. 

Healthcare workers are at the front line of the epidemic, and are most likely to become infected with Ebola 

If successful it will be months before any vaccine is available and the initial quantities will be reserved for healthcare workers fighting the crisis

Scientists at a British company say they have come up with a test to fight the Ebola epidemic.

Experts at Primerdesign Ltd said it has developed a fast and simple way to screen suspected victims.

They say the kit detects the DNA fingerprint of the Ebola Virus in the blood in just 90 minutes and is 'affordable' and 'easy to use'.

The firm is now in talks with the World Health Organisation about plans to roll out large numbers to the frontline in West Africa as soon as possible.

Doctor Jim Wicks, Managing Director of Primerdesign, a spin-off company from the University of Southampton, said it meets an 'urgent' need.

Dr Wicks said: 'Accurate diagnostics is essential in controlling an outbreak like Ebola.

'There is an urgent need for rapid testing to screen suspected patients and people travelling in and out of the region.

'Our test is quick, affordable and easy to perform.'

By picking up minute quantities of the disease in the early stages, the kit makes pre-emptive healthcare intervention possible.

It works on the principle that viruses all have a unique genetic fingerprint, like humans, only its encoded in RNA (Ribonucleic acid) rather than DNA.

A blood sample is taken from the patient before RNA is extracted, placed in a tube with the kit's ingredients and run through a machine.

The result is ready within 90 minutes. 

'Without you we can't succeed, without your quick response a tragedy unforeseen'.

Professor Levine, said: 'This research will give us crucial information about whether the vaccine is safe, well tolerated and capable of stimulating adequate immune responses in the highest priority target population, health care workers in West Africa.'

'If it works, in the foreseeable future it could help alter the dynamic of this epidemic by interrupting transmission to health care and other exposed front-line workers.' 

The drug consists of an adenovirus (cold virus) that does not cause illness in humans.

It has been modified so it can't multiply in humans, but produces a single attachment protein of Ebola virus.

The body's immune responses against this single Ebola protein have been found to be highly protective in studies carried out on animals, researchers said.

Prior to September the vaccine had only been tested in animals.

A second trial on African soil is expected to begin soon in the Gambia, to run in parallel with the Mali study.

Ordinarily it would take between six to 11 months to obtain the necessary ethical, technical and administrative approvals to move from animal vaccine trials to one in a developing country, where subjects are at risk of the natural disease.

But the consortium behind the vaccine study worked in unison to achieve the goal in two months.

Professor Samba Sow, director general of Mali's centre for vaccine development said: 'This is just the critical first step in a series of additional clinical trials that will have to be carried out to fully evaluate the promising vaccine.

'However, if it is eventually shown to work and if this information can be generated fast enough, it could become a public health tool to bring the current, and future, Ebola virus disease epidemics under control.'

And Dr Milagritos Tapia, the clinical investigator overseeing the trial in Mali, added: ' 'Malian health care workers are showing keen interest in participating in the clinical trial to help evaluate this vaccine.'

Praising the work of the scientists involved, Dean Albert Reece of the University of Maryland , said: 'Ebola is among the most urgent international public health issues we are facing.

'This research will play a key role in helping to solve it... (the scientists) have done an extraordinary job, and are working hard to contribute their expertise to the worldwide effort to fight this virus.'

But it is likely to be months before any effective vaccine will be made available.

And in the first instance, any small quantities produced, would be given to healthcare workers on the front line fighting the disease. 

It is hoped the move will help encourage doctors, nurses and other health workers - who are at highest risk of becoming infected - to join the fight against the disease in West Africa. 

The vaccine was developed at the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.

Ebola vaccine trials are also underway in the UK, led by Oxford University and the Wellcome Trust, and in the US, at the National Institutes of Health. 

While Mali is yet to sucummb to the spread of the vicious disease, experts say it is vital vaccines are trialled in Africa.
