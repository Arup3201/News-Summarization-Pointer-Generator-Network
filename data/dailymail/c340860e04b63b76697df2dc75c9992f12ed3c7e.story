Why did the Duck cross the road? To hand out moving violation tickets apparently.

On Halloween, police in Fort Lee, NJ used an undercover officer, dressed in a 6-foot-4 Donald Duck costume to bust 130 drivers for failing to yield to a pedestrian, according to WABC. 

On Oct. 31, as part of the Fort Lee Police Department's pedestrian decoy program, the officer, dressed in the costume, would step out into the crosswalk as if he were crossing the street.

Caught: When drivers failed to stop for the costumed cop, uniformed officers pulled them over farther down the road and gave them a moving violation ticket carrying a $230 fine as well as two points on their driver's license

When drivers failed to stop for the costumed cop, uniformed officers pulled them over farther down the road and gave them a moving violation ticket carrying a $230 fine as well as two points on their driver's license, WABC reports.

'Two years ago, we had 62 people struck,' Fort Lee police chief Keith Bendul told WABC. 'This year, we had 40, I'm glad to say. But zero is my ultimate goal.'

WABC was present at the time the decoy program was held and reports that one driver honked his horn for the undercover cop to get out of the way and other times, drivers continued to drive through the crosswalk when the duck was in the street.

On the Department's Facebook page, it was made clear that the undercover officer was not crossing the street against a traffic light or pedestrian control sign.

This effort by Fort Lee police may have led to the busts of more than one hundred drivers, but some drivers are saying they feel tricked by the Department's act.

Karen Haigh, a River Edge resident who was ticketed, told WABC that she didn't know what the duck was trying to do.

'They told me that I was getting a ticket for not stopping for a duck,' she said. '...this duck kept going to the curb, off the curb, I thought it was a crazy guy on Halloween.

'It scared me. It was a huge duck. If it was a normal person I would have stopped, and I think all those people would have stopped.'

Bendul said that using the undercover cop dressed as Donald Duck was for a good reason.

'When you see a pedestrian, child, adult or duck, stop,' Bendul said. 'Let them cross and proceed with your day.'

Haigh says she plans to fight the $230 ticket because she didn't know what the costumed cop was trying to do and feels she was treated harshly.
