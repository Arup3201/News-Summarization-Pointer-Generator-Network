Alert: Gregory Lewis fled his $1,000 bail in September and is suspected of at least six more violent sexual assaults across the country since

A Massachusetts man who fled child rape charges and is suspected of carrying out at least six more sexual assaults on a coast-to-coast raping spree is believed to be returning home.

Gregory Lewis, 16, fled his home town of Southbridge after he cut off his GPS tracking bracelet on September 15 and left it on the front lawn on his alleged 13-year-old female rape victim.

Freed on only $1,000 bail, Lewis is believed to have traveled as far as the West Coast and was last spotted on surveillance footage in Columbus, Ohio.

Law enforcement have declared him armed and extremely dangerous and told the public not to approach him.

'He is coming back east, and he is committing crimes as he goes,’ said David Procopio, a spokesman for the Massachusetts State Police to the Boston Globe.

'We have concerns that he could be coming back to Southbridge.’

A nationwide alert has been sent to all law enforcement authorities to apprehend Lewis, who in addition to grooming and raping the 13-year-old girl, is accused of luring 'multiple' escorts to his seedy motel rooms and beating and raping them.

'The victims have been handcuffed, threatened with a gun, robbed, and sexually assaulted,' says a report issued to all state police in an update.

Search: The suspect is driving his stepfather's Jeep Cherokee, which was stolen on September 25 from his home along with cash and a handgun

Lewis is believed to be driving a blue 2004 Jeep Gran Cherokee which he stole from his stepfather on September 25, after returning home for an evening and beating and handcuffing him.

He left home armed with cash, a 9mm handgun and more than 200 rounds of ammunition and Massachusetts State Police spokesman David Procopio has said that 'We have to assume that he's armed.'

Authorities now believe that Lewis has stolen license plates from Idaho within the past two weeks and the vehicle has no front fog lights and has a rear bumper sticker.

The suspect is described as 6 feet 2 inches and 270 pounds with a tattoo of a demonic female figure on his right upper arm and a tattoo of a hand holding a knife with a broken handcuff on his chest.

'People should not approach him, obviously,' said Procopio to the Boston Herald.

Lewis was arrested on August 5 and charged with raping the 13-year-old girl.

He was released on $1,000 bail, a decision which left many dumbfounded.

'Certainly this gentleman should have never been released on bail,' said Southbridge Town Councilor Clemence to the Boston Herald.

'I hope that the judicial system will fix some of those mistakes because it’s wreaked havoc across the country.'

The circumstances that allowed a suspected child rapist to flee on an alleged cross country raping spree began when Judge Michael Allard-Madaus set bail for Lewis at only $1,000 - but on the condition he wore a GPS ankle bracelet and stay away from anyone under 16.

The suspect is described as 6 feet 2 inches and 270 pounds with a tattoo of a demonic female figure on his right upper arm and a tattoo of a hand holding a knife with a broken handcuff on his chest.

While out on bail on September 15, he drove to the girl's house, in breach of his bail, removed his GPS tag and left it on her lawn and vanished.

One week later, on September 23, ABC affiliate WSOC in Charlotte has reported that Lewis attacked a 29-year-old woman at a motel on Yorkmont Road.

The woman who didn't want to use her name said Lewis told her she he lived in Charlotte.

'I met him on Plenty of Fish, a dating website,' the woman told WSOC by phone.

It was just after arriving at the motel that Lewis began to attack the woman.

'He put me in a choke hold and put handcuffs on me with my hands behind my back and said I'm not going to hurt you I just want your money,' she said. to WSOC.

The woman managed to engineer her escape after telling Lewis that most of her money was in her car.

When they reached the parking lot, she fled.

Police have released several surveillance photos of Lewis from recent days, but have admitted he may have shaved his facial hair.

Two days after the North Carolina assault was when Lewis returned home to rob his stepfather.

He then traveled in his Jeep Cherokee to Denver in early October and is suspected of committing robberies and rapes there.

He then moved onto Portland, Oregon on or around October 13 and then moved onto Boise, Idaho and then in turn to Salt Lake City, Utah.

He is then thought to have made his way back through Denver and was last spotted in Columbus, Ohio over the weekend.

“We have reason to believe that Lewis is heading east again. We know that he was in the Columbus, Ohio, area Sunday evening and we know he was further west prior to that,” said state police spokesman David Procopio to the Boston Herald.
