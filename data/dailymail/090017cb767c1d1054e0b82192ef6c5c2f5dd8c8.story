Julien Macdonald is unapologetic about his love for high octane glamour, but his AW15 collection was a departure from the usual feast of glitter and sequins he's made his signature.

Indeed, the Welsh designer and Strictly Come Dancing star isn't the first - and won't be the last - designer to embrace gothic glamour in London this season.

Julien's racy designs were overtly sexual yet maintained that sense of sophistication that makes him a red carpet favourite.

Welsh designer and Strictly Come Dancing star Julien Macdonald put on another stellar show in London

Dominatrix-esque models took to the runway wearing thick chokers, long black gloves and embellished luxe silks. 

Dresses, both long and short, came with peek-a-boo cutouts and were worn with thigh-high leggings, ensuring the Julien woman garners attention for all the right reasons.

Clearly keeping his clientele in mind, his red carpet-ready dresses were form-fitting and embellished with subtle smatterings of sequins.

His beauty look, which FEMAIL witnessed being crafted backstage by legendary Val Garland using L'Oreal Paris, was as glossy as his designs.

Skin was flawless and models were treated to a cashmere complexion, which was juxtaposed against high shine lids and lips.

'I took a tough Berlin chicness and relocated it into the world of Julien Macdonald,' she said backstage.

Hair supremo Syd Hayes completed the look by giving models' hair a perfect gel gloss over.

With an exhaustive list of paparazzi favourites - including Rosie Fortescue, Millie Mackintosh, Tamara Ecclestone, Rochelle Humes and Michelle Keegan - occupying the front row, one thing's for sure: the designs witnessed here today won't be hanging around Julien's showroom for long.

Markus Lupfer's enchanted woodland was the talk of town on Saturday - with a presentation complete with actual bunny rabbits. 

Taking the prize for most aesthetically pleasing show space, flowers draped from the ceiling in Markus' secret garden.

Sports luxe shapes, animal wood fabrics and trainers souped up with glitter made up his collection, which, he says, is 'a bit mystical'. 

Backstage Lucy Burt created a modern day fairytale heroine using Bobbi Brown's covetable collection. 

'I've created a fresh, healthy glow but with a bold edge,' she explained to FEMAIL.

'The skin is clean and youthful and I haven't picked up a single brush to create the look; it's very organic,' she explained as she massaged the brand's BB cream into the skin to create a flawless finish before pinching a touch of Pot Rouge in Chocolate Cherry and Raspberry onto the cheeks.

Lips were also subject to a pinch of rouge, while lashes were clumped up with Smokey Eye mascara and inky cobalt blue gel eyeliner.

Bumble and Bumble's Ali Pirzadeh created the 'expensive cool' nonchalantly tied ponytails, while Ciate pulled out woodland green as they key colour when it came to adorning nails.

 MARIANA JUNGMANN

Governed by long sharp lines and jacquard cuts, Mariana Jungmann worked with soft leathers that defined traditional feminine shapes.

Jungmann’s signature use of Renaissance lace has evolved in her AW15 collection through stitching techniques that constructed a bold yet fluid appearance, which took to a great start to London Fashion Week on Friday.

Using a combination of warm tones of black, teal and tan, Jungmann contrasts the natural shades with strong cuts and forms.

Laser cut textiles contrast with depressed imprints on leather textiles between pieces.

The ‘Hypnagogia’ collection works with these techniques while embracing the modern businesswoman through some looks, and bold feminine eveningwear in others.

Striking fur pieces worked with the long tailored lines that Jungmann adopted while the mixture of textiles was what stood out.
