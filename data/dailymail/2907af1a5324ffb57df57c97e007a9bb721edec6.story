Andre Schurrle looks set for the Stamford Bridge exit doors after the German midfielder was left out of Jose Mourino's squad to face Bradford City on Saturday.

Mourinho insisted the German would feature in the FA Cup fourth round clash with the League One promotion hopefuls, but the winger is nowhere to be seen.

Andre Schurrle is rumoured to be closing in on a move to Bundesliga outfit Wolfsburg this January

Schurrle has been heavily linked with a move away from west London in recent weeks with Bundesliga side Wolfsburg keen to snap him up.

Reports suggest Chelsea are hoping to receive £27m for the player they signed from Leverkusen in 2013 for £18m, but are in no rush to deal in the transfer window. 

The Portuguese manager said: 'The principle is that we would like him to stay.

'The question is not to be allowed or not allowed. The question is not to have a good offer.

'The question is to have a phenomenal offer and a player to be super keen to accept a new challenge in his career because we don't want to sell our players.'

Jose Mourinho had previously stated that Schurrle would start the game against Bradford City

Wolfsburg are ready to lure the midfielder back to the division in which he started his career with the promise of regular first team football.

He has reportedly given fellow senior players the impression that he is ready to leave the club and his sale could free up funds for reported target Juan Cuadrado.  

The sale of Schurrle could free up welcomed transfer funds for Fiorentina target Juan Cuadrado
