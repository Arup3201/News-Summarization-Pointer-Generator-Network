The holiday season's new films drew crowds of people to theaters on Wednesday to make it the second highest-grossing Christmas Day on record for the U.S. and Canadian box office, according to estimates from box office tracking site Rentrak.

Yesterday's box office haul was estimated at between $76.5 and $78 million, topping 2012's $74.9 million Christmas day earnings.

It was led by the Tolkien-based The Hobbit: The Desolation Of Smaug, which took in $9.3 million for a total of $149.9 million since its opening on December 13. The Wolf Of Wall Street, staring Leonardo DiCaprio, was right behind with $9.2 million on its first day in theaters.

Cult comedy Ron Burgundy sequel Anchorman 2 took in $8.1 million for third place. Ben Stiller's The Secret Life Of Walter Mitty took $7.8 million on its first day in theaters to put it in fourth place for Christmas Day.

Crime drama American Hustle rounded out the top five with $7.4 million.

Other Christmas debuts included Keanu Reeves' 47 Ronin, which opened with $7 million, boxing movie Grudge Match which earned $4 million, and Justin Bieber's Believe which took in $1.3 million.

Rentrak's senior box office analyst Paul Dergarabedian chalked up this Christmas' box office success to the number and variety of new releases, as well as the sheer number of people who decided to go see them.
