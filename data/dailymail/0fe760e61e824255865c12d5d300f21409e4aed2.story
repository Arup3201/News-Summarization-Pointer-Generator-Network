Caught: Michael Owen spotted the intruder on his CCTV

Footballer Michael Owen stopped an intruder at his mansion after spotting the man on his own CCTV.

The 32-year-old Stoke City player shared the attempted trespass with his 1.5m Twitter followers as he watched police arrest the man.

Mr Owen said he saw the trespasser sneak around in the vegetation in the grounds before hiding from police in a van.

It was around 7pm on Friday that Michael Owen tweeted live updates from the action at his £1.6million mansion near Northorp, North Wales, where he lives with wife Louise and their four children.

The former England and Liverpool player wrote on the microblogging site: ‘Great TV tonight. Been watching some fella on my cameras for an hour weighing up what to nick.’

After calling the police on the intruder he kept his followers updated, writing: 'Police came round while he hid in my woods.

'They then went and 5 minutes later 
he runs back to his van and hides in the boot!’

A few minutes later he bemusedly added:
‘Watched it all laughing my head off as the police returned to drag him
out.’

One of his 
followers asked how many security cameras he had, Mr Owen confidently 
replied: ‘Enough to catch anyone so don't even think about it!!!’

He later took to Twitter to give thanks to the police before playing against Manchester City yesterday.
