A couple have been accused of locking their autistic 13-year-old daughter in a basement and forcing her to wear diapers.

A couple from Brookfield, Wisconsin, has been accused of locking their autistic 13-year-old daughter in the basement of this house, forcing her to wear a diaper and sending her to school covered in feces 

Police were alerted when an anonymous caller said the youngster was 'being treated like an animal'. 

Prosecutors say the child has low-level autism and some cognitive disabilities, and was forced into the basement every day after school.

There she would be made  to put on an adult onesie and a pull-up diaper,Fox 6 reported. In the morning she would then get on the school bus. 

The girl's mother and stepfather, who have not been identified, are charged with child neglect. 

When police removed the girl from their home in Brookfield, just west of Milwaukee, the temperature in her basement bedroom was around 50 degrees. 

Court papers say the couple referred to the girl as 'Stink' and her stepfather refused to let her use the family bathroom or sit on the furniture because she thought she was disgusting 

An anonymous caller tipped police, saying the girl was being treated like an animal. 

Emily Levine, executive director of the Autism Society of Southeastern Wisconsin, told WISN: 'It makes me cry, or want to punch somebody. Both. I can't understand wanting to hurt a child.

'This is part of the stigma that's attached to autism and other behavioral disorders, is people are treated in an inhuman way.
