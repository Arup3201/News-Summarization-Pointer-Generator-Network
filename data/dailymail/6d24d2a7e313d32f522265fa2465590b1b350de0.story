Nobody likes to part with their money to pay a dreaded parking fine but a trainee paramedic did just that for a complete stranger who was visiting her dying mother.

After spending sleepless nights in a palliative care home in Melbourne by her mother’s side, Rosemary Morgan was slapped with a parking fine and put it in her handbag to deal with at a later date.

But just a few days later Mrs Morgan was astonished to receive a handwritten note in the post from paramedic Marc Primrose, who had helped transport Mrs Morgan’s mother to her house to spend her final days, saying he paid the $29 fine which he had found in the ambulance.

‘Most people would’ve picked that up and thrown that in the bin and not have given it a second thought,’ Mrs Morgan told Daily Mail Australia. 

‘We just couldn’t believe that a stranger would bother to do that for someone.’ 

Trainee paramedic Marc Primrose found the $29 fine in his ambulance and decided to pay the fee as a kind gesture to Rosemary Morgan who was dealing with her mother's final days

Mr Primrose sent the receipt for the paid infringement and a post-it note explaining why he had decided to pay the fine.

‘I also wanted to pay the fine for you given the difficult time you and your family are going through,’ the note said.

Once getting over the passing of her mother, Mrs Morgan began to ring around a few weeks ago to find out where Mr Primrose worked to thank him for his kind gesture.

 

 

‘Everyone I spoke to said “that’s him - he’s just genuinely nice person – he’s like that all of the time”,’ she said. 

‘He’s in his second year in paramedics at uni so he’s perfect for the job – it’s nice to know there are people out there like him looking after others.’

She was able to meet up with Mr Primrose recently to express her gratitude in person.

‘He takes it all in his stride – he doesn’t think he’s done anything too fantastic but we are the opposite we think it’s extremely kind,’ she said.

‘So we wanted him to get some sort of recognition because every time you turn on the TV somebody is ripping somebody off all of the time and this just so the opposite.’

Mrs Morgan said although the cost of the fine was only $29 – it meant so much more to her and the rest of her family.

‘To us it didn’t matter how much it was - it may as well have been $1,000,’ she said. 

‘He’s going to uni so I’m sure he’s got uni fees so for him to do that is fantastic.’
