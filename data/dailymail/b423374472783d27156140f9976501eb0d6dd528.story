Andrius Valnuchinas was caught as part of a policing operation targeting serious criminals operating in the West Midlands

A Lithuanian thug who was caught trading guns and ammunition in a busy retail park yards from hundreds of shoppers has been jailed for 11 years.

Andrius Valnuchinas, 37, was caught as part of a policing operation targeting serious criminals operating in the West Midlands.

Plain clothed officers spotted him get into a silver Mercedes at the Gallagher Retail Park in Wednesbury, West Midlands, after he placed a black plastic bag in the boot of his car.

Valnuchinas chatted with the driver, 
later identified as Amarjit Singh, before getting out and got back into 
his Ford Focus and driving off.

Officers tailed and stopped Singh around 4.45pm on Wolverhampton Street, Darlaston, on May 24, 2012.

The
car - which had no registered keeper or insurance - was searched and a 
bag containing three Russian Tordev 7.62mm semi-automatic pistols and 
three magazines loaded with bullets.

A sinister green latex mask of 
Frankenstein's monster was also found in the boot which police believe 
was a disguise bought for a possible future robbery.

The
officers called for armed back-up and the weapons were seized for 
forensic examination at the laboratories of the National Ballistic 
Intelligence Service.

Unemployed Singh, 43 of Wolverhampton, West Midlands, was arrested on suspicion of possessing an offensive weapon and possession of firearms with intent to commit an arrestable offence.

Earlier this year he pleaded guilty to three counts of possessing a firearm and ammunition at Wolverhampton Crown Court.

He will be sentenced in January.

Haul: Police found a bag containing three handguns, three magazines loaded with bullets and a latex mask of Frankenstein's monster

Deadly: Three Russian Tordev 7.62mm semi-automatic pistols were found

Valnuchinas, of Bilston, West Midlands, was arrested in October 2012 from an address in Hinstock, Shropshire as the operation concluded.

He was jailed for 11 years at Wolverhampton Crown Court on Monday after having earlier pleading guilty to the supply of firearms and bullets.

Investigating officer Detective Constable Mark Black, from West Midlands Police's Serious and Organised Crime Unit, said: 'This was a significant haul of guns and ammunition seized as part of an intelligence led policing operation.

'While we may never know what terrible crimes the two men or their associates were plotting, the fact that three guns and 24 bullets have been taken out of the hands of criminals and destroyed is significant, lives have potentially been saved.'

In total, three Tordev handguns were seized along with three magazines packed with 24 bullets and brass knuckle duster were seized for destruction.

Loaded: The officers called for armed back-up and the weapons were seized for forensic examination

Mask: A mask of Frankenstein's monster was found in amongst the weapons
