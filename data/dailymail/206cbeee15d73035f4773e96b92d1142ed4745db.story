Bulge battle: Cruciferous vegetables in addition to exercise can help you slim

I am a fit 65-year-old female. I am 5ft 6in and weigh around 7.5st.

I play golf at least twice a week in the winter and in the summer I can play up to five times a week. I walk six miles with a friend once a week and average 3.8 miles per hour.

My problem is that as I have got older my stomach/waist has definitely increased and I would love to slim down.

Obviously I have no need to diet but as I have problems with my neck, shoulder and elbows I need to take care when it comes to doing exercise.

Is there anything you can recommend that I can do at home? The thought of going to a gym just does  not appeal.

It sounds like your active lifestyle is keeping you in great shape, although based on your height and weight your BMI of 17.5 shows you’re actually slightly underweight (anything between 18.5 and 24.9 is considered normal).

If you’ve always been naturally slim, how frustrating it must be that you’ve now gained weight around your middle for no apparent reason.

But the dreaded middle-aged spread is a problem for many women post-menopause.It has been attributed to changes in hormone levels as we age.

Progesterone levels in women decrease far faster than oestrogen levels during the menopausal years, leading to what some doctors claim is ‘oestrogen dominance’ in the body, which can then be compounded by high oestrogen levels in our food and water.

As oestrogen acts like a ‘fat magnet’, high levels of the hormone are associated with weight gain around the middle – so one key to combating this is diet.

You have no need to diet for weight loss, but what you eat is as important as portion size and those who believe in this theory recommend avoiding ‘oestrogenstimulating foods’ and upping the intake of foods that shift excess oestrogen out of your system.

This means eating more ‘cruciferous’ vegetables like broccoli, cabbage and kale (you can find a list online) and citrus fruits, as well as insoluble fibre.

No crucifixion: Cruciferous vegetables include broccoli, types of cabbage and kale

This is found in whole grains, carrots, flax and other seeds. It binds itself to excess oestrogen in the digestive tract and carries it out.

Muscle mass also decreases as we age, which can slow the rate at which we burn calories (meaning you’ll gain weight even if you eat the same amount).

To combat this, try adding some musclestrengthening exercises to your daily routine – which can easily be done at home using some Pilates bands, a set of hand weights or even a TRX machine – a suspension system. Pilates is a brilliant exercise for strengthening and slimming the core. A few private sessions at home will be more effective in targeting your specific problems.

I have developed a medical condition as a result of which I suffer from very tender and painful hands and wrists. Can you recommend general exercises that do not involve me having to lean on my hands? I do not swim and already walk as an exercise.

There are many ways to stay fit without using your hands. You’re already a walker but have you thought about running? It’s one of the easiest ways to work out, as the only equipment you need is a good pair of running shoes.

I’m also a big fan of high intensity interval training (HIIT), where you perform one exercise for 20-30 seconds and rest for 10, for a cycle of eight rounds. Download an app like Hot5, which has all sorts of mini workout videos to try at home.

Surfer dude: Henry Holland has designed his own line of board

Designer
 Henry Holland has created a line of surfboards for his new Resort 
collection – which doesn’t surprise me at all, as surfing has never been
 more fashionable.

In New York, W Hotels and members club Soho House 
both offer lessons at the city’s Rockaway beach, while Stand Up Paddle 
Board surfing, as popularised by celebrities such as Cameron Diaz, is a 
fast-growing water sport.

Is Henry a surfer himself? I don’t think so, 
but for such a dedicated party boy he is fit. He works out at least 
three times a week, and ran the 2011 London Marathon in under three and a
 half hours.

Cardiologist Dr Carl Lavie argues it’s possible to be overweight and still be healthy.

He says overweight patients may live longer than those of ‘normal’ weight, because they have more energy reserves to fight illness.

But isn’t obesity likely to result in heart disease and diabetes? Healthy bodies do come in all sizes, but issues that lead to poor food choices and weight gain must be addressed.

So Coca-Cola plans a new ‘lower-sugar’ drink called Coke Life.

The new product contains a third less sugar – but still more than four teaspoons in each can.

For a healthy drink to really hydrate you, try fizzy water with a squeeze of lemon or lime and a tiny pinch of salt. Delicious.
