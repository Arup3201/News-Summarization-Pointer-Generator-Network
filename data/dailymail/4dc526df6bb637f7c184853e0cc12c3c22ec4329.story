A 'jealous' wife who stabbed her husband’s pregnant ex-lover in the stomach was jailed for 10 years today.

Andrea Dean attacked Stacey Jenkins outside a primary school in Liverpool when the victim was 37 weeks pregnant with her husband Christopher's baby, the city’s crown court was told.

Dean knifed Ms Jenkins seven times with a 10cm filleting knife striking her abdomen, leg, hand and arm.

Miraculously, the 28-year-old victim and her unborn child survived and the baby girl, named Hope, was born at full term three weeks later.

Dean, 40, of Kremlin Drive, Liverpool, was sentenced today after earlier pleading guilty to wounding with intent and attempted child destruction.

Her 'weak' husband, Christopher, also 40, was sentenced to 30 months after pleading guilty to assisting an offender, perverting the course of justice and aiding and abetting his wife.

The court heard he had driven his wife to the confrontation, although he did not know she was armed with the knife, and afterwards hid the weapon and gave her a false alibi.

Jailing the couple, Recorder Clement Goldstone, QC, said Dean had made no secret of her animosity towards Ms Jenkins.

He told her: 'The pregnancy was a source of great annoyance and jealousy to you.

'Not only because the father was your husband and he had fathered another child outside your marriage, but also because you had been trying, unsuccessfully, to have another, fourth child with your husband and your annoyance may have increased even further when you learned that the child which Stacey Jenkins was carrying was in fact a girl - you having three sons.'

Turning to her former fishmonger husband, the judge said: 'You are a victim of your own weakness.

'You did not have the strength of character to stand up to your wife when you realised she was contemplating, if not an attack, then at least a confrontation with the woman who was heavily pregnant with your child.'

Ms Jenkins, who attended court today, became pregnant with Christopher Dean's child in 2008 when they started a relationship after he had separated from his wife of 17 years.

But the Deans soon reunited and he left Ms Jenkins to return to the matrimonial home.

Andrea Dean found out about the pregnancy when Ms Jenkins posted images of a scan on Facebook.

Ms Jenkins had also posted photographs on the website of her daughter in school uniform, and Dean was able to work out she attended a primary school in Tuebrook, Liverpool.

She became increasingly angry and jealous and, the court heard, she urged her husband to 'stab' his former lover and said that if he did not, she would.

On November 8 last year the couple set off to confront Ms Jenkins and, unknown to her husband, Dean was armed.

She lay in wait outside the school with the knife hidden inside her boot.

Witnesses said that as Ms Jenkins walked by, Dean bent down as if to tie her shoelaces.She then pulled the knife from her boot and lunged at Ms Jenkins.

In her police statement, the victim said: 'I put my arms across my stomach to protect my unborn baby.

'She was almost on top of me, bent over me and stabbed me again in the right side of my stomach. I rolled over on to my side to protect my stomach and made myself into the foetal position.

'She was trying to roll me over to expose my stomach but I started kicking her to get her away from me and as I did, she stabbed me in the thigh.'

The judge said: 'Miraculously, none of Stacey Jenkins' injuries were life threatening.

'She recovered at least from her physical injuries though the psychological trauma will no doubt live with her and continue to do so.

'Equally, if not more miraculously, her unborn daughter survived before being delivered at full term three weeks later.

'What an irony, in the circumstances of what you have done to her, that she should have named that child, Hope.'
