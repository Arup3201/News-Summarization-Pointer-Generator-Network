A driver may regret his decision to park on a building site after workmen dug around his Mercedes, leaving it marooned on a tarmac island.

Baffled workmen at Edinburgh Waverley station - one of the busiest in Scotland - had to excavate around the luxury saloon after the driver apparently moved barriers in a bid to park the car.

Rather than tow the vehicle or delay the car park resurfacing, workmen simply dug around it on Friday.

Marooned: Work continues around a luxury Mercedes that was parked on a building site

Car park owners Network Rail said the driver ignored warning barriers to leave the saloon on the building site

Network Rail, which owns the car park has now asked police to try and trace the owner, who could face a fine.

A spokesman said they had the right to charge the driver for any costs 
incurred as a result of delays to the £100m refurbishment of the station.

The spokesman said red barriers had been placed across the road but said 'the guy has moved them and parked inside'.

However, Network Rail workers did leave a ramp so the driver could leave the car park.

One workman, who did not want to be named, said: 'We can't move it. The people who own the car park have tried to contact its owner.'

Passers-by were bemused by the scene. One woman said: 'It seems a bit daft. Why not tow it?'

Pictures of the marooned car quickly spread online with people posting about the 'hilarious' blunder.

One commuter said: 'I came back to my car and saw this Merc totally on its own.

Workmen did not tow the car as a show of 'good faith' to the driver, who failed to return and now police have been asked to trace the owner

Network Rail said the driver could be fined for any costs incurred as a result of delays

'It is pretty hilarious really - the owner has obviously totally ignored the cordon that had gone up and has been left there.

'Fair play to the workers - they've just got on with their jobs.'

Asked why engineers continued the work despite the car being there, the Network Rail spokesman added: 'We could have held off but we were running a tight schedule.

'Any delays cost money and further inconvenience to customers.

'We decided to leave the car out of good faith in case the owner returned - when he didn't by the close of business on Friday workers there left a tarmac ramp so he could drive off.

'Just as in cases where people crash into bridges and so on, we are well within our right to claim any losses back from the individual.'

The work is part of a £100million refurbishment of the station that has included a new roof, new entrances and the refurbishment to the station's concourses.
