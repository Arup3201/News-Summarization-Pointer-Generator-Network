In the hour after a teenager was allegedly raped in a park by a 51-year-old man, she was found crouched up in a ball, make-up smeared over her face and twigs in her hair.

'She was just crying. Hysterical. Her hair was all messy, she smelt of vomit. She didn't look good at all,' her friend told Sydney's District Court on Wednesday.

The crown alleges the heavily intoxicated 18-year-old was repeatedly sexually assaulted by Joseph Stephen Rosenburg in Sydney's Hyde Park in the early hours of August 30, 2013.

The man is accused of indecently assaulting the teenager outside a Sydney building, before following her into Hyde Park and forcing her to have oral and anal sex.

A Sydney court has heard that a 51-year-old man forced a teenager to have anal sex in Hyde Park

The girl's friend found her by St James Station near Hyde Park 

He has pleaded not guilty to three counts of sexual intercourse without consent and three charges of indecent assault.

At the second day of his trial, a friend of the teenager, who cannot be named, said she had become concerned for the 18-year-old after receiving a text that was 'gibberish'.

After finally getting in touch with her, the friend said she told her to wait outside Starbucks on Park Street and she would pick her up.

As she drove into the city to collect the teenager, she told the jury she tried repeatedly to call her friend again. 

The 18-year-old allegedly sent a series of illegible texts to her friends asking for help

On the ninth call, she said the teenager picked up.

'She was hysterical, just crying and saying, `He hurt me, he hurt me' ... She said, `He raped me'.'

The friend said she found the 18-year-old outside St James Station, lying in a ball, crouched up.

'Her make-up was smeared all over her face. There were scratches high up on her legs.

'When she saw me she cried and grabbed my arm and didn't want to let go.'

The court heard from another of the teenager's friends, who she had been partying with at a bar on Oxford Street earlier that evening.

The friend told the court that the 18-year-old had consumed around 750ml of vodka from a bottle in less than half an hour.

Shortly after, she said the 18-year-old went missing from the club.

On the first day of the trial, the court heard the teenager had been out with friends at a bar on Oxford Street and after leaving in a taxi with an unnamed man, was left lying on the side of street after she was sick in the vehicle.

It is alleged that Joseph Stephen Rosenburg came up to her and put his hand up her dress, and followed her into Hyde Park where she went in an attempt to escape him.

The court heard the teenager had consumed excessive amounts of vodka after being sick in a taxi

The 18-year-old lay down near a tree, suffering the effects of excessive alcohol, and was followed by Rosenburg who allegedly came up to her and began touching her.

'Are you going to kill me?' she allegedly asked him.

'No, I'm not going to kill you if you go with it,' he allegedly replied.

She allegedly sent her friends a series of illegible texts to her friends pleading for help, including 'I'm being tapes (sic), help'.

Rosenburg was arrested in March 2014 with his DNA matching forensic samples found on her underwear, the court heard.

Rosenburg's barrister Ken Averre said it wasn't disputed his client had oral sex with the teenager, but that the question of consent was in question.

Mr Averre said that Rosenburg denied having anal sex with the 18-year-old.

The trial continues.
