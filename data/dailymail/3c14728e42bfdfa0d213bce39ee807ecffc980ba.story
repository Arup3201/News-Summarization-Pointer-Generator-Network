Support for Ukip has crumbled in the‎ wake of its European election victory, a new opinion poll suggests today.

The party has fallen back to single figures to be on nine per cent, down seven points from 16 per cent last month.

Nigel Farage’s party has failed to advance since it became ‎the first party other than Labour or the Tories to come first in a British national election in modern political history in May.

David Cameron's Tory party appears to be picking up Ukip deserters, after Nigel Farage's party dropped seven percentage points in the latest opinion poll to drop back into single figures, while Tories take the lead

It spells good news for the established Westminster parties, including the Tories who have gone into the lead in the poll.

According to the Guardian/ICM poll, Ukip has gone into reverse with the Tories gaining the most of the defectors, up three points to 34 percent.

Labour gained one point to to 33 per cent and the Lib Dems went up two to 12 per cent.

The party’s advance started to flounder weeks after its European election win when it failed to take the Newark by-election. The seat was held by the Tories in June.

But the poll also shows that support for the Conservative and Labour parties - who are separated by just one point - is almost at a dead heat.

It is the third month running that the two parties have had virtually the same number of points.

Ed Miliband's Labour are one point behind the Tories with 33 per cent - the third month that the two parties have been virtually the same

Martin Boon, director at ICM Research, said: ‘We used to talk about parties getting themselves through the “magic” 40 per cent threshold before they would be in serious contention to win, but less than a year before a general election, both the big parties are currently struggling to get themselves into the middle 30s, which, of course, only the Tories managed in 2010.’

Mr Boon also suggested that Ukip's apparent decline in popularity is fairly normal for parties who are propelled into the limelight during mid-term elections.

He said the party dropped to a similar extent - from 18 per cent to 12 per cent - from May to June last year.

Meanwhile, according to the Guardian, the polls shows there are not many factors separating the two more popular parties in the current polls.

Support from men and women is evenly spread across both parties, reflecting a change from previous years which showed a far lower number of women voting for the Conservatives.

Tories also appear to have a fairly even spread of voters from across the demographic, with 30 per cent voting from the lowest DE occupational grade and 34 per cent from the AB professionals.

But results for the leading party are still uneven when it comes to age and the regions where people vote.

More than half (52 per cent) of the over-65s are still more likely to vote Tory.

The party also appears to have much less support in Scotland (21 per cent), Wales (18 per cent) and the north (21 per cent), compared with the Midlands, where it has 46 per cent.
