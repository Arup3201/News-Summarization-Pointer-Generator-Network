Ministers are under pressure to bring in new anti-begging laws to cope with an anticipated invasion of aggressive street beggars from Romania and Bulgaria.

They have been pressed by five local government chiefs and a police and crime commissioner for stricter laws so that intrusive hustlers can be arrested and kept off the streets.

In a letter to Home Office Minister Norman Baker, they warned of ‘professionalised, aggressive begging’ which hovers ‘inconveniently, or perhaps conveniently, between high-level anti-social behaviour and low-level criminality’.

They want tougher clauses written into the Government’s Antisocial Behaviour, Crime and Policing Bill so that beggars face arrest if they repeatedly ignore a new order known as an Injunction to Prevent Nuisance and Annoyance.

It is claimed the measure, which replaces Antisocial Behaviour Orders, ‘will bark but won’t bite’.

Immigrants
would use an independent Scotland as a ‘barn door’ to set up home in 
the rest of the UK, a campaign group has warned.

They
would use a more ‘liberal’ migration policy north of the border to head
south – and stopping them would mean border controls that could harm 
tourism and business travel, says MigrationWatchUK.

Chairman
Sir Andrew Green said the issue must be a ‘red line’ in negotiations if
Scots vote ‘yes’ to independence in next September’s referendum.

‘This would not just be a back-door to the rest of the UK; it would be a barn door,’ he said.

The letter was written following growing difficulties in some London boroughs with organised gangs of Eastern European migrants and was signed by leaders of councils in Westminster, Birmingham, Nottingham, Southampton and Slough.

It was also backed by West Midlands Police and Crime Commissioner Bob Jones.

Westminster councillor Nickie Aitken said: ‘We are not concerned about working people from Romania and Bulgaria.

We are worried about begging gangs coming here to get money. They will start in central London, then they will spread out to Birmingham, Manchester, Leeds, and other cities. They will go further afield.’

She added: ‘As things stand, we won’t be able to arrest them.’ The letter has also won support from other local authorities.

Susan Hall, Tory leader of Harrow Council in north London, said: ‘The ripple effects of crime associated with new waves of East European immigrants and rough sleeping are already creeping further out across London.

‘They even targeted our Christmas fair on Saturday, where Peppa Pig was appearing. If Peppa Pig is in their sights it doesn’t bode well for the rest of us.’

The concerns come amid increasing pressure on David Cameron over the lifting of British labour market restrictions on Romanians and Bulgarians in January.

Mr Baker said: ‘We will listen to the views of local authorities regarding antisocial behaviour as we have done throughout the development of the Bill.’

The move comes ahead of an expect influx of beggars from Romania and Bulgaria next year
