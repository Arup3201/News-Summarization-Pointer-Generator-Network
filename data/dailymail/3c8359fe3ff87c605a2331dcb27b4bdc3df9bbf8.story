These eerie images show the elusive Great Grey Owl - known as the phantom of the north - gliding through snowy Lapland in hunt of prey.

The Great Grey Owls are shown flying ghost-like through the wintry land, invariably staring down the camera lens with their luminous yellow eyes.

Wildlife photographer Jules Cox annually visits Lapland in the winter time hoping to shoot the magnificent owls but had not yet had any luck.

He again travelled out to Finland this year and managed to photograph the stunning Northern Lights - but the Great Greys evaded him once more.

But, just a few weeks after returning home he was informed by a Finnish friend that the owls had been spotted hunting there.

Without hesitation Mr Cox booked a flight out to Finland, chancing his arm that he may fulfill his photography dream.

Mr Cox, 41, from Bermondsey, London, said: 'For the last few years I've visited Finland in winter in the hope of photographing this beautiful bird.

'But, the more I chased, the more the opportunity seemed to elude me.

'Only a matter of weeks after returning from Finland though a Finnish guide told me a couple of Great Grey Owls had been seen hunting in open areas of Lapland.

'There was no time to waste, Great Greys are nomadic and there was no knowing how long the owls would remain in the area for.

'Flights were hastily booked and followed by a madcap dash to Heathrow, we then had a long wait at Helsinki Airport for a connecting flight to Lapland.

'But the gamble paid off - just hours

In Scandanavian myth and folklore the Great Grey Owl is sometimes referred to as the Phantom of the North.

The species, of which males can grow up to 33 inches in length, are also known as a Lapland Owl.

Mr Cox added: 'There were five to six of the Great Greys in the area when I got there.

'I focused my shots on a specific pair though who were particularly accommodating.

'The whole experience was just totally unreal and it really finished off the year in style.'

Nomads: Mr Cox said it is difficult to catch the Great Greys as they are nomadic and it is impossible to say how long they will stay in any given area
