Missing: Kayla Campbell was last seen leaving her parents house on Sunday afternoon

Search: Dive teams searched the lake where Kayla's bicycle, helmet and cell phone were found

Her bicycle, helmet and cell phone were found near a lake yesterday - about a mile away from her house.

Family members believe that she is alive, though possibly no longer in the area.

Her father Robert Campbell told 
ABCNews.com: 'We were just dealing with the emotions of a teenager, 
having to do with some online relationships on a Tumblr page. These 
relationships were not healthy.'

Mr Campbell said that he instructed his daughter to get home before dark on Sunday, and when he called her in the evening after she hadn't returned, he grew suspicious.

He told the network: 'We called her at 5:20pm and she said she was close-by, but we didn't feel like she was telling the truth... We became concerned when the GPS on her phone showed her being in one 
area and she told us she was in another. She's not great with 
directions.'

Dive teams later searched the lake, but found no trace of Kayla, who reportedly suffers from depression.

On Monday, the FBI joined the search for Kayla, a student at Independence High School in Charlotte.

Mr Campbell told ABCNews.com: 'The authorities have jumped on everything and are doing a great job. It's been very hard, but my family is staying strong.'

Police are currently treating her disappearance as a missing persons case.

Police Lt J.K. Rowell told The Charlotte Observer: 'At this time, we have no reason to believe there was an abduction.'

Cops say that tips are flooding in with possible information 
on the missing girl, and officers are following up on the calls they have received.

Her brother Josh told WBTV: 'She's a great kid, couldn't ask for a better sister. All we want right now is for her to come home safe and unharmed.'

On her battle with depression, he told the station: 'Kayla was getting better. She was working with professionals who were getting her the helps she needs and she was getting better.'

On her Tumblr page, Kayla had written of attempting to commit suicide on several occasions.

Several Facebook pages have been set up spread the word about her disappearance and release her picture.

Police are now appealing to the public for help.

Lt Rowell told WSOC-TV:
'We don't know where she is. So if anyone knows where she is or has 
heard from her, knows anything about this, please give the Mint Hill 
Police Department a call.'

Kayla is described as having brown hair and blue eyes. She's about 5'6" tall and weighs about 115 pounds.

Anyone with information is asked to call Det Tim Lezette at 704-545-1085.
