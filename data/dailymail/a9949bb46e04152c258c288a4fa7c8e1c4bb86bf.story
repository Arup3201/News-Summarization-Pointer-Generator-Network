Swansea City defender Neil Taylor looked as if he had gone 15 rounds in a boxing ring after receiving a badly-cut eye following a challenge by Manchester City skipper Vincent Kompany during Saturday's game at the Etihad Stadium. 

Taylor looked dazed as he was treated on the touchline with blood streaming down the left side of his face and returned to the pitch a few minutes with his eye virtually closed after being sprayed to heal the wound. 

A pumped-up Kompany, back in the Manchester City team after a calf injury, led with his arm and a high boot as he jumped above Taylor in an aerial challenge after half-an-hour and appeared to catch his opponent with the point of his elbow.

Kompany was warned by referee Neil Swarbrick who then booked him soon afterwards for a foul on Wilfried Bony. Swans boss Garry Monk didn't blame the Manchester City captain though.

'Neil is better-looking now. The scars will do him some good,' he joked. 

'He took a nasty bump to the eye, it was quite swollen. had a bad bump but he will be fine. I didn't see the actual challenge but I don't think it was intentional or had any malice in it. Neil didn't mention in the dressing-room afterwards anything untowards had happened.'
