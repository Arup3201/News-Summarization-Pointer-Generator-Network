It was a day of peculiar reunions as Manchester United’s players returned to the club’s Carrington training ground for their first ball-playing sessions of pre-season on Monday morning.

In the absence of newly appointed manager Louis van Gaal, assistant coach Ryan Giggs assumed responsibilities on the training field, but it was the make-up of the playing staff, rather than coaching staff, that was causing near jaw-ache among the chattering classes at the club’s AON Training Complex.

All those players who did not appear at the World Cup in Brazil returned late last week for the usual rigorous medical testing to assess how their fitness had been maintained in the close season.

In charge: Ryan Giggs took Manchester United's first pre-season training in the absence of Louis van Gaal

International pedigree: Van Gaal will join up with United after Holland's World Cup campaign is over

First-team returnees included new signing Ander Herrera, Jonny Evans, Michael Carrick, Darren Fletcher, Tom Cleverley and Rafael Da Silva.

However, there was also much consternation as several loanees returned to the club - including cast-offs such as the Portuguese winger Bebe and the Brazilian midfielder Anderson - with their tails firmly between their legs. 

Bebe was signed in a bizarre £7million 
deal in the summer of 2011 - despite Sir Alex Ferguson later admitting 
he had not seen the winger play - and the 23-year-old is still yet to 
start a Barclays Premier League match four years later.

Change of scene: Anderson spent the second half of last season on loan to Serie A outfit Fiorentina

He was the one player immediately 
written off by David Moyes last summer and it is understood that Louis 
van Gaal will adopt the same approach towards a player with one year 
left on a five-year contract. United will loan Bebe out for a third 
consecutive season or sell him on a permanent deal if they can find a 
buyer.

Anderson, for his part, became a source 
of frustration for Moyes over his perceived lack of fitness, evidenced 
by the damning statistic that he has completed ninety minutes of Premier
 League football on only 18% of the 104 appearances he has made in a 
seven-year spell of fluctuating form at Old Trafford.

He endured a stuttering loan spell at 
Fiorentina in the second half of last season and United may encounter 
trouble as they attempt to recoup in excess of £20m for the player 
signed by Sir Alex Ferguson on the recommendation of his brother, 
Martin, who said: ‘Alex, he’s better than (Wayne) Rooney.’

Familiar sight: Anderson has only completed 18% of the 104 Premier League appearances he has started

There was, however, excitement to see the return of several young and talented players to the club, including Wilfried Zaha from Cardiff, who is hoping to be granted a clean slate by Van Gaal after being frozen out by Moyes over his perceived failure to grasp the immaculate standards expected of a Manchester United player on the training ground.

Nick Powell, who Sportsmail understands who would have been promoted into the first-team pool had Ferguson remained in charge last season, has also returned after a campaign with Wigan Athletic, along with 21-year-old forward Jesse Lingard from Brighton and Chilean striker Angelo Henriquez, who struggled to make an impact on loan at Real Zaragoza last season.

Assistant manager Ryan Giggs is believed to have pencilled in meetings with every player for this week and he will advise Van Gaal over the right course of action with United’s young players, although any decision will ultimately be rubber-stamped the Dutchman.
