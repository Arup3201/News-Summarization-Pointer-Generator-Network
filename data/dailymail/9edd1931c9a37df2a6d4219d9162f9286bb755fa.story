Australians have hit back at Prime Minister Tony Abbott after he said the most important thing he had accomplished for women this year was the repeal of the carbon tax, because it helped women balance the household budget.

Voters have taken to social media to slam his comments, by posting pictures of irons, ironing boards and other household items with the tongue-in-cheek hashtags #thankstony, #putyourironout and #putoutyourboards.

In an interview on The Today Show on Monday morning host Lisa Wilkinson asked the Prime Minister to name his biggest achievement this year in his dual role as Minister for Women.

Tony Abbott says his biggest achievement this year as Minister for Women was to repeal the carbon tax

'Well you know it's very important to do the right thing by families and households, and as many of us know women are particularly focussed on the household budget,' the Prime Minister said.

'And the repeal of the carbon tax means a $550 a year benefit for the average family.'

Ms Bishop, Foreign Minister and the most powerful woman in the Abbott government, sought to play down the prime minister's comments.

'There are numerous issues that could be mentioned in the context of what we do for women,' Ms Bishop told reporters in Adelaide.

'I think what the prime minister was focusing on was the policy change that would have the largest impact on families and households.'

Following his Mr Abbott's comments the hashtags #thankstony and #PutYourIronOut soon began trending on Twitter and Facebook.

'#Thankstony With the Carbon tax repeal I can buy a new apron,' one woman tweeted.

'#ThanksTony, because of the carbon tax repeal I can afford to leave my sandwich press on ALL THE TIME just in case my hubby wants a snack,' said another.

In a major Cabinet reshuffle on Sunday the prime minister promoted Sussan Ley to the health ministry

Others were more critical.

'Thankstony for setting women and families back a few decades,' one Facebook user said.

'Well he wasn't lying. Pity the only woman to benifit (sic) from repeal of carbon tax was Gina Reinhardt (sic) #ThanksTony,' one man tweeted.

After talking about the carbon tax, Mr Abbott added that the Government has its 'fair dinkum paid parental scheme' coming into parliament in 2015 along with improvements to childcare.

'And obviously I'm very pleased that I was able to promote three women in my own ministry yesterday,' he said.

In a major Cabinet reshuffle on Sunday the Prime Minister promoted Sussan Ley to the health ministry.

As health minister she becomes the second woman in Cabinet, after foreign minister Julie Bishop.

The elevation of Ms Ley to cabinet has been accompanied by the promotion of Kelly O'Dwyer and Karen Andrews as parliamentary secretaries, addressing long-standing criticism of the lack of women in the ministry.

Mr Abbott was pleased the number of women on his frontbench had increased, but stressed all appointments were made on merit.

Mr Abbott dumped Defence Minister David Johnston and named Kevin Andrews as a surprise replacement, in a major reshuffle to 'reset and refocus' the Government for the new year.

The frontbench overhaul also moved immigration minister Scott Morrison into an expanded social services portfolio.

Peter Dutton has been given the immigration portfolio, while Josh Frydenberg will become assistant treasurer.

He replaces Arthur Sinodinos, whose resignation on Friday sparked the ministerial rejig.

The reshuffle just days before Christmas is an attempt to reboot the coalition, who by the prime minister's own admission had a 'ragged' end to 2014.

The new frontbench team will be sworn in on Tuesday, and would 'reset and refocus the government for the coming year', Mr Abbott said.

'This is a good team. It is a strong team. It is a balanced team,' he told reporters in Canberra.

'It will put jobs and families at the heart of our political agenda for 2015.'
