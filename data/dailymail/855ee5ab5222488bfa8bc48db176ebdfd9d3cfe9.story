This is the moment two lazy binmen were caught on camera filling a bin so they did not have to empty it.

The men rearranged the refuse inside the large wheeled container to ensure the lid was jammed open, even picking up rubbish from the ground and piling it on top.

They then took a photograph of their handiwork as ‘proof’ that the bin was too full for collection, and strolled off.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

'Utterly ridiculous': Mr Ahmed said he could not believe the footage of the binmen stuffing extra cardboard boxes into the wheelie bin

But the work-dodging pair were not as clever as they thought – their antics had been caught on CCTV footage.

Now Cambridge council, which employs them, has issued a humiliating apology for the ‘inexcusably poor service’, and has promised to discipline the men after an investigation.

But the shopkeeper who fell victim to the scam – and was left with the jam-packed bin after it should have been taken away – said the ‘moronic and inexcusable’ duo may have pulled the same stunt on countless other taxpayers.

The CCTV footage shows the two men arriving at the back of the Dars Express convenience store in the city.

Caught on camera: The workers had no idea they were being filmed as they put extra cardboard into the bin

One of the pair finds the large 
wheelie bin comfortably full, with the lid propped only slightly open. 
He immediately begins ‘plumping up’ the rubbish inside to make it appear
more full, and pulls a flattened cardboard box partly out, to jam the 
lid wide open.

His colleague then joins in, taking 
out a camera as he prepares to get the photographic evidence to justify 
them leaving the bin behind.

Several more cardboard boxes from the
ground are stuffed casually inside the bin, before a black bin bag is 
picked up off the ground and placed on top, as the grubby icing on their
cake of lies.

Only then is the photograph taken, 
and the pair stroll off. Their whole deceitful operation has taken a 
minute, which could have been spent emptying the bin.

Red-handed: The pair are seen 'puffin up' the rubbish so the bin looks even more overfilled

The first that shop owner Iftkhar 
Ahmed knew of the affair was when he found his bin – which he shares 
with the neighbouring Seven Days Chinese restaurant – still full.

He called the council for an 
explanation, but was promptly told the authority had photographic 
evidence the bin had been overloaded. Mr Ahmed said: ‘We checked our 
CCTV – and couldn’t believe our eyes. It is totally and utterly 
ridiculous.

‘This is a total disgrace and God knows how many others this has been done to. These actions are moronic and inexcusable.’

Mr Ahmed added: ‘In the footage it is
apparent that the bin was filled sufficiently and set to be emptied. 
But the bin collectors chose to be indolent and deceitful.

Not happy: Mr Ahmed described the binmen's behaviour as 'moronic'

‘Not only did they refuse their duty 
but added to the waste, filling it past the maximum capacity where the 
bin could no longer close and put a bin bag on top of the bin lid. Their
purpose was clear in making it appear as though we had over-filled the 
bin.

‘Not having suitable waste facilities
has created an unsafe and unhygienic environment for our customers and 
employees. As a result, we have lost revenue and gained stress.’

The council’s head of refuse 
collection, Jas Lally, said: ‘We have written to the owner of the 
premises and apologised for this poor service, which is inexcusable. 
Arrangements are being made to investigate this in accordance with the 
council’s disciplinary policy.’
