A teen mum is on the run with her one-month-old daughter and a boyfriend who is wanted in relation to a homicide, according to police.

Californian Diana Zamora Cardenas, 16, and her baby Davina are believed to be with the father, Nicolas Alcala, 19.

Alcala allegedly killed Pedro Aispuro, 34, on June 4, by shooting him while he stood outside a taco truck in Huron.

Police say he is armed and dangerous but that she left with him voluntarily. The Hanford Police department is searching for the trio and Lieutenant Pat Crowe said they were likely together.

'The baby daddy is the one we believe she left with or is going to meet up with,' he told The Huffington Post.

Wanted: Alcala is the suspect in a murder investigation

Fresno County Sheriff Margaret Mims spoke to KFSN-TV on the day of the shooting.

She said: 'He is currently wanted for a homicide that occurred in Fresno County.'

'There was a large gathering on the main street of that city. There was a fight and shots were fired. As a result one person is dead having been shot numerous times.'

Aispuro's relatives told KFSN-TV that he had survied being shot four times during a separate shooting in January.

Cardenas was last seen on Sunday with her daughter at home in Hanford before being reported missing by her mother later that day.

Now they suspect the trio could be hiding in Avenal or Kettleman City and could even head to Mexico.

Cardenas' friends have not been helpful with the search, according to inspectors.

The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children describes both Cardenas and Davina as Hispanic.

She is about 5 feet 1 inch tall and has a birthmark on the inside of her left arm.
