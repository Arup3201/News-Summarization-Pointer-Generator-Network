'Bienvenida Cuba! Netflix is now available...'

That was the tweet the company sent out earlier today after its movie and TV streaming service officially launched in Cuba.

Netflix series such as House of Cards, Orange is the New Black and Marco Polo will all be available to Cuban subscribers at a cost of $7.99 per month.

Netflix is the latest business to join the list of US companies looking to take advantage of thawing diplomatic
relations between the United States and the communist-ruled
island country.

The United States announced new rules on Jan. 15 that will
significantly ease sanctions on Cuba, opening up the island to
expanded US travel, trade and financial activities. 

Netflix plans to expand to 200 countries in two years

Netflix co-founder and CEO Reed Hastings said: 'We are delighted to finally be able to offer Netflix to the people of Cuba, connecting them with stories they will love from all over the world.

'Cuba has great filmmakers and a robust arts culture and one day we hope to be able to bring their work to our global audience of over 57 million members.' 

President Obama has previously revealed that he is a fan of House of Cards.

During a meeting with tech CEOs at the White House, Obama once even asked Mr Hastings if he had brought advance copies of the second season of the show. 

Obama expressed his admiration for Frank Underwood, the 'ruthlessly efficient' congressman played by Kevin Space and the way his character gets 'a lot of stuff done'.

It remains to be seen if Cuban leader Fidel Castro will feel the same way about the political show. 

Only time will tell if Cuban leader Fidel Castro likes Netflix's House of Cards as much as President Obama. The president says he likes the 'ruthless efficiency' of congressman Frank Underwood from the show

It's unclear how well the streaming service will work on tablets and other devices in Cuba. The Latin American country has one of the lowest internet penetration rates in the world - barely five per cent

Netflix began offering its service in Latin America in 2011.

Cuban residents who want to join the area's existing five million subscribers must have access to international payment methods like debit or credit cards. 

Cuba, with a population of about 11 million, has one of the
lowest internet penetration rates in the world -  barely five per cent. 

Broadband access and Wi-Fi are also highly restricted.

Netflix's streaming video service added 4.3 million
subscribers in the fourth quarter, of which more than half were
from outside the United States.

The company plans to expand to 200 countries within two years. 

It will launch its movie
and TV streaming service in Japan in the fall of 2015.
