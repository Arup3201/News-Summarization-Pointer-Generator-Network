A cramped flat at the top of a 31-storey tower block might seem an undesirable prospect even for those on a lengthy council housing waiting list.

So it seems incredible that a property matching this description is on the market for £375,000.

The fact it is at the summit of the 322ft Trellick Tower helps explain the steep asking price. Rising from the fashionable landscape of West London’s Notting Hill, this Brutalist tower is possibly the most famous social housing block in Britain.

The three-bedroom flat’s vendors, Monica Merabet, 50, a former airline worker, and her husband Abdulhafid, 53, a bus driver, brought up their three daughters and son in the flat, moving in as council tenants in 1995 and buying it under the right-to-buy scheme three years later.

They say their children, Maria, 29, Joanna, 25, Halima, 20 and Hafid, 18, who still lives in the 780 sq ft flat, loved growing up in the property so much they begged them not to put it on the market.

They must have a head for heights as the flat’s balcony, which faces south, is not for vertigo sufferers.

‘You see the sun rise on one side of the flat and set on the other,’ says Monica. ‘You can see as far as Kent and Hertfordshire and all the main London landmarks such as the London Eye, the BT Tower and the Shard.

‘This is a great area to live in with Portobello Market on our doorstep and great schools, sports facilities, shops and hospitals nearby.’

Trellick Tower was built by the Hungarian-born Modernist architect Erno Goldfinger, whose surname was borrowed by James Bond author Ian Fleming for his villain in the 1959 book of the same name.

He saw his design as the future for modern housing. The tower is built in a narrow oblong with a separate lift tower linked at every third storey to the main block.

Inside, the flats were built to dovetail each other. Where one flat had a front door at the top of a staircase leading down to the living area, next door would always have the opposite design with the front door at the base of the stairs. This was intended to reduce noise transmitting between the apartments.

But by the time the block was completed in 1972, high-rises were becoming unpopular with council tenants because they attracted crime and anti-social behaviour.

Trellick’s fortunes started to rise following the formation of a residents’ committee in the Eighties. A door-entry intercom system was introduced and a concierge employed. With security improved, and the right-to-buy scheme in place, many of the flats changed from council to private ownership. Now 45 of the 217 flats are privately owned. In 1998 the tower was Grade II listed.

Having paid £65,000 for the flat, after a £50,000 discount under right- to-buy, Monica has done well out of the Tower’s rising popularity.

But there is a £3,000-a-year service charge and the building’s private residents face a bill for the insulation of the roof and power-hosing the outside walls. This is under negotiation but stands at £16,000 per flat. Gary Saunders, of selling agents Westways, also points out that obtaining a mortgage on a flat in a high-rise isn’t straightforward.

He says: ‘Funding can be difficult for flats in local authority high-rise tower blocks. But love it or hate it, Trellick Tower will continue to dominate the skyline over what is likely to be the trendiest area in West London for many years to come.’

Monica is fast to allay fears about unreliable lifts and crime that some may have about living in a high-rise.

‘We have never had any problems with crime,’ she says. ‘And the lifts have only broken down once in the whole time we have lived here. I once went through a fitness phase and ran up and down the staircase for training. You wouldn’t believe how quickly I got fit.’
