A youthful Sunderland side secured their fourth pre-season win on the bounce, as they beat Recreativo Huelva 1-0 thanks to a late penalty from teenage French striker Mikael Mandron.

Gus Poyet's men have racked up impressive wins against Darlington, Carlisle and Hartlepool on home soil in recent weeks - scoring nine goals and conceding just once - but their winning streak looked set to end before Mandron smashed home a spot-kick in the 78th minute.

The Uruguayan coach started his U21 side at the Estadio Municipal de Albufeira for the match against Spanish side Recreativo, the first of three pre-season friendlies they they will play in Porgual before returning for the start of the Premier League season.

Battling for possession: Sunderland midfielder George Honeyman tussles for the ball with Recreativo's Dimas

Martin Smith came within a whisker of giving the Black Cats the lead in the 23rd minute when he smashed a free-kick on to the crossbar from 25 yards. The rebound fell to David Ferguson on the edge of the box but his first-time effort arrowed just wide.

Recreativo Huelva: Galvez, Veja (Araujo 71), Juanan (Zamora 71), Montoro (Vasquez 60), Nunez (Corcoles 71), Joselu (Avila 71), Ruben Dimas (Molina 71), Cabrera (Larena 71), Victor Diaz (Aitor 71), Menosse (Quintana 71), Zambrano (Koke 71).

Subs not used: Jorge.  

Sunderland: Dixon, Cartwright, Ferguson, Beadling, McNamee (Roberge), Agnew (Ba 46), Smith (Bridcutt 46), Honeyman, Lawson (Mavrias 46), Watmore (N'Diaye 46), Mandron.

Subs not used: Mannone.

Goal: Mandron 78.

Recreativo then had their best chance of the first half when Victor Diaz nearly scored with an ambitious backheel, only for Liam Agnew to hack the ball away on the goal-line.

Poyet made a number of changes at the break, with Vito Mannone the only substitute not to appear at the start of the second half.

Shortly before the hour mark Recreativo hit the woodwork through defender Herman Menosse, the Uruguayan thumping a header against the crossbar with Joel Dixon well-beaten.

In the 72nd minute Sunderland were forced into bringing Duncan Watmore back on, despite the midfielder being subbed off at the break. 

Having used all their outfield substitutions, the youngster trotted back on to replace George Honeyman, who had picked up an injury.

And six minutes after that change, Poyet's side were ahead.

Charis Mavrias was brought down by Avila inside the Recreativo penalty area and the referee quickly pointed to the spot.

Mandron stepped up to take the spot-kick and made no mistake from 12 yards, blasting his effort into the back of the net.

There were further injury woes for Sunderland before the match ended, as Watmore picked up a knock and was replaced by Lawson.

The Premier League side play CD Nacional on Wednesday and then Vitoria Setubal on Saturday, before returning to England ahead of the start of the Premier League campaign.
