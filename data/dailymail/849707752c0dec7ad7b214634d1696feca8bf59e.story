An Oklahoma inmate condemned to death by lethal injection died because of an error in the way the IV was administered, according to the results of a private autopsy released Friday.

The autopsy, which was arranged by
 lawyers representing condemned Oklahoma inmates, determined that prisoner 
Clayton Lockett, who died 
following a botched execution, had healthy veins but his body had 
punctures from multiple attempts to tap them.

Pathologist
 Dr. Joseph Cohen performed the autopsy, which challenged the official explanation that Lockett died because of his veins being 'blown out.'

Cohen said Lockett had good veins. He said it appeared the execution team failed repeatedly while inserting an intravenous line.

'Contrary to statements by the state, Mr. Lockett’s veins did not 
collapse or "blow out,"' according to Cohen’s findings. 'Rather, 
despite the excellent condition of Mr. Lockett’s veins, the execution 
team made numerous failed attempts to set an IV, eventually setting an 
improperly placed and ineffective IV in Mr. Lockett’s femoral vein.'

According to Cohen, placing an IV in the femoral vein, which is in the groin area, is a more painful and risky way to inject drugs intravenously.

Cohen also said more information was needed to determine why Lockett died. Oklahoma officials said previously that it appeared Lockett 
didn't receive a full dose of three lethal drugs.

The state claimed that Lockett apparently died of a massive heart attack during his botched execution.

The State of Oklahoma has put a moratorium on executions until the problem with Locketts can be fully evaluated

Lockett's
 April execution was halted after the execution team discovered a 
problem with the IV, but he died shortly afterward.

According to the Los Angeles Times, Lockett writhed, groaned, and attempted to speak after receiving the lethal injection. He died 43 minutes after the drugs had been administered.

Results from a state
 autopsy are pending. Toxicology reports haven't been issued, so it's 
unclear how much of the drugs Lockett received.

Oklahoma has imposed a moratorium on executions in the state, until a full examination of the issues surrounding Lockett's botched execution are fully examined.
