DC Comics have reversed their decision to ban the Superman 'S' from appearing on a murdered five-year-old boy's memorial following mounting public pressure.

The comics giant sparked outrage on social media after refusing to permit the logo on a life-sized statue of Jeffrey Baldwin who was starved to death by his grandparents in 2002.

The Canadian boy had been locked in a cold, urine and feces-stained bedroom in the home of his grandmother, his Catholic Children's Aid Society-approved guardian, and wasted away to the weight of a baby.

'DC Entertainment uses a flexible set of criteria when we receive worthy requests such as this, and at times have reconsidered our initial stance,' a DC Comics spokesperson said in a statement, according to The Star.

'After verifying the support of appropriate family members, DC Entertainment will be allowing the Jeffrey Baldwin Memorial Statue to feature the Superman ‘S’ shield.'

Following an inquest earlier this year, Ottawa IT worker Todd Boyce was touched by the words of Jeffrey's father Richard in his testimony, and started raising money for a statue of Jeffrey.

Mr Baldwin had said: 'He wanted to fly. He tried jumping off the chair. We had to make him stop. He dressed up (as Superman) for Halloween one year. He was so excited. I have that picture at home hanging on my wall. He was our little man of steel.' 

Mr Baldwin added that before his teenage parents lost custody of Jeffrey to his maternal grandparents the little boy was very energetic and loved the superhero.

Mr Boyce's appeal to raise money online was successful, and the statue was designed and the model created, with Jeffrey wearing his favorite costume.

But, Mr 
Boyce says, when DC Entertainment found out, the comic book giant 
refused him permission to use the iconic diamond-shaped 'S' logo. 

'It
 was important for me because I really felt I wanted to capture the 
photograph of Jeffrey wearing his Superman costume and have it as close 
to that as possible,' Mr Boyce told CBC News. 

'Basically
 they didn't want to have the character of Superman associated with 
child abuse. They weren't comfortable with that.' 

Mr Boyce told  CBC News he was angry and emotional when he first learned of their refusal, but after subsequent conversations with people at the company and their lawyers, he softened his stance.

Mr Boyce was prepared to change to the design to a 'J' instead of an 'S'.

Backlash

However DC
 Comics' decision led to uproar on social media, with dozens of people 
urging the company to change its mind and threatening a boycott.

The company today called Mr Boyce saying they'd reversed their decision.

'I
 think all along DC has been very sensitive ... that this is something 
they really did struggle with as an organization,' Mr Boyce told The 
Star.

'In hindsight, maybe they might have been better off just quietly giving us permission in the first place.'

One of Jeffrey's sisters has chosen a poem to be engraved on a bench that will be part of the memorial, Mr Boyce said.

It begins with the line 'I wish heaven had a phone so I could hear your voice again.' 

Jeffrey's grandparents were convicted of second-degree murder in 2006. They had custody of Jeffrey and his three siblings.

Two of them were treated relatively well, the inquest heard, but one of his sisters was subjected to the same conditions.

The difference between Jeffrey and his sister was that she was allowed to go to school and the daily snack she received there probably saved her life, the inquest heard.

MailOnline has approached DC Entertainment for a comment.
