Boris Johnson could boost support for the Tory party if he became leader by reaching out to rock fans of Nirvana, Jimi Hendrix and Muse, new research reveals.

The London Mayor would be able to reach parts of the electorate which David Cameron cannot, securing backing for the Conservatives from 36 per cent of voters if he was in charge compared to only 30 per cent for the Prime Minister.

While Mr Johnson won over fans of rock bands and comedians, Mr Cameron’s supporters were more likely to prefer Radio 4, Rugby Union and Anneka Rice.

Appeal: The Tory party could win over more voters if Boris Johnson was leader because he has a wider appeal than David Cameron, according to new research

The six per cent of voters prepared to switch to the Tories if Mr Johnson was leader were more likely to use Facebook and Twitter, play video games and earn less than £25,000, according to the YouGov study.

The data emerged using the polling firm's
 new Opigram system, which gets respondents asks thousands of people to 
list out everything they have an opinion on, like or dislike - movies, 
books, celebrities, even food.

Supporters of the Mayor of London were also more likely to be fans of surreal comedians like Eddie Izzard, Bill Bailey and Ross Noble, rock acts Muse, Green Day, Nirvana and Jimi Hendrix, and TV presenters Jeremy Paxman, Clive Anderson and Jeremy Clarkson.

They were also likely to name Mediterranean classic aubergine parmigiana as a favourite dish.

The interests of Mr Cameron’s backers 
were more traditional, preferring BBC Radio 4’s long-running comedy show
 Just A Minute, and considering themselves admirers of Prince William, 
Margaret Thatcher, Bill Gates, and tennis ace Andy Murray.

They are also more likely to own their own homes, work full-time, own a car and work in the private sector.

People
 who like Mr Johnson describe themselves as ‘individualistic, 
knowledgeable, disorganised’ but Cameron-likers see themselves as 
‘friendly, organised and hardworking’.

Safe: Mr Cameron is viewed by voters as being too risk averse and 'comfortably establishment' by pollsters YouGov

Traditional: People who vote for the Tories lead by David Cameron also like Margaret Thatcher, the England Rugby Union team and TV presenter Anneka Rice

Stephan Shakespeare, YouGov’s chief executive, said: ‘True, much can be derived simply from knowing that Johnson has a greater appeal to younger voters.

‘But there's more to it: the Johnson attraction has something of the 'outsider' to it, whereas DC is all about the establishment.’

Writing on ConservativeHome he added: ‘It would be stupid to propose changing leaders, but Conservatives should be much more serious about understanding the added reach of Johnson, rather than just dismissing it with irritation.

‘To win the next election, Conservatives need to move outside their familiar comfort zones.’

He urged Mr Cameron to ‘take some risks’ in order to broaden his appeal.

‘Being Prime Ministerial doesn't have to mean being so comfortably establishment.

‘He needs to find some of that edginess, some of that ability to surprise, that he had when he first went on his quest to be leader and challenged the status quo,’ Mr Shakespeare added.

Of the people willing to switch to back the Tories only if Mr Johnson was leader, 23 per cent voted Lib Dem in 2010 and only a quarter (24 per cent) consider themselves as Conservatives.

One in five switchers is aged 18-24, compared to just one in ten of Mr Cameron’s supporters.
