Honeymoon murder suspect Shrien Dewani will be extradited to South Africa next month, after losing his marathon legal battle to stay in the UK.

The millionaire businessman is expected to be flown to Cape Town on April 7, arriving the next day.

He will then appear in court to face allegations he ordered the killing of his 28-year-old wife Anni in November 2010, while they were on their honeymoon in the country.

His latest appeal against his extradition was rejected earlier this month by three High Court judges.

Dewani, 33, from Bristol, has argued that he should not be forced from the UK to face trial until he has recovered from mental health problems, including depression and post-traumatic stress disorder.

His wife was shot as the couple travelled in a taxi on the outskirts of Cape Town while on their honeymoon.

He denies any involvement in her death.

Mthunzi Mhaga, justice spokesman for the South African government, said: 'He (Dewani) is expected to leave London on 7 April and land in South Africa on 8 April 2014.

'Upon arrival the National Prosecuting Authority and South African Police Service will cause him to appear in the Western Cape High Court depending on the time of his arrival.

'He will be kept in a medical facility due to his peculiar condition.

'We are working tirelessly to ensure that his return to our shores brings to finality this protracted legal process. We are confident that he will receive a fair trial in our courts.'

Commenting that Anni's family will not immediately be travelling to South Africa, her uncle, Ashok Hindocha, said: 'It has taken nearly four years and countless legal arguments which, at times, have driven us as Anni's family almost crazy.

'I can see the toll it has taken on Anni's parents, my brother and his wife.'

Speaking today, Anni's father, Vinod Hindocha, reiterated his hope that the trial will bring the answers his family long for.

He said: 'There is a sense of relief that Shrien is going back, but absolutely no reason to celebrate and certainly no animosity towards him.

'I have said all along and I stick to that promise today, if he invites me to travel with him I will put my arm around his shoulder and do that.

'I just want the truth and the whole truth so that I can begin mourning properly. My wife and I live like zombies and hardly sleep.'
