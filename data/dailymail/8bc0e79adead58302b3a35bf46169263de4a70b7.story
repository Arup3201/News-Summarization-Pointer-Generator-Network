A man who won £3.1million on the lottery accused his son of harassment after a row sparked when he refused to share the jackpot.

The case was thrown out after alleged victim Alex Robertson, 58, failed to turn up because he was sunning himself in Benidorm, Spain, where he lives with his partner Morag.

He told police his son William Robertson, 35, sent him threatening text messages that had left him petrified, the court heard.

Robertson was arrested and was due to stand trial at Northampton Magistrates Court today charged with harassment, but was released after his father failed to show up.

He and his brother, Alex Jnr, 36, had fallen out with their father after he shared a massive £38million Euromillions jackpot with a a 12-stong syndicate of Stagecoach workers from Corby, Northamptonshire.

The elder sibling claimed that his father, who told him he would see 'f*** all' from the cash, had only given 200 cigarettes since the win.

The case centred on three text messages Robertson sent last September to his father.

Paul Harkins, defending, told JPs: 'The not guilty plea to section two harassment was entered before this court on January 31.

'The allegation is one of harassment made by my client Mr William Robertson’s father Mr Alexander Robertson.

'Effectively it takes the form of three text messages which were sent on September 25 last year.

'Two were sent at around 4pm and the other at 6pm, the prosecution say they amount to harassment, we say they don’t.

'Mr Robertson Snr was a very lucky man.

'In March of last year, 2012, he was part of a syndicate of 12 bus drivers from Corby who scooped £38 million pounds on the lottery, you may have read about it in the papers.

'His share was £3.1million.

'As a result of that he started to spend some time in Spain, regular visits to and from with his new partner and eight months ago he bought a property there.

'Money clearly is no object for this man to jump on an EasyJet flight to be in the country. Today he chose not to be.

'Mr Robertson Snr has been in touch with my client, he invited him to Spain, to the local pub, he paid for the taxi.

'This is the man who talks about being petrified of William Robertson, can’t leave the house, a bird flies at the window, he jumps, he is up till 3am because he can’t sleep and has turned to drink.

'One would imagine the cross examination that would have been put to him to see if he would have been harassed by three text messages that were sent on September 25.'

Chairman of the bench Angus Ferris told Robertson: 'You have been listening to what has been going on.

'No evidence will be offered in this matter, the case against you is dismissed and you may leave the court.'

Mr Robertson refused to comment after the case.

In January this year Mr Robertson’s brother Alex Jnr revealed the family had been 'ripped apart' by the lottery win.

He claimed he attacked his father’s brand new 4x4 Shogun with a hammer when he told his son he would see 'f*** all' from his win.
