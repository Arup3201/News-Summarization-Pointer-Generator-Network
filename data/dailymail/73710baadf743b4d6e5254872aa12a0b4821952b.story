A pigeon has been caught on camera flying at speeds of 90km/h and zipping in between cars on a busy freeway in Australia.

The footage was captured by a passenger inside a car, who filmed the low-flying bird on his mobile phone while driving alongside it.

The passenger starts filming after spotting the bird flapping furiously in the middle lane to keep up with traffic around it.

'What are we doing, 100(km/h)?' the male passenger asks the driver.

'Ninety. We're doing ninety,' he replies, before commenting that the pigeon is 'awesome'.

While driving at high speeds themselves, the pair watch the bird zip in between cars - maintaining speed as it spectacularly changes lanes.

When a vehicle races up behind the pigeon, the men both yell out simultaneously as if to warn the bird.

'Whoa, whoa, whoa, ease up. Ease up!' one of the males says.

The car they are in then accelerates past the bird, who seemingly decides to take the freeway exit for a breather.
