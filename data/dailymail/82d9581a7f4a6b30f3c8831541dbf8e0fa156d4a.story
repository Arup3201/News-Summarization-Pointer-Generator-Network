A billionaire couple have forked out $10 million of their own cash to pay for care for some of the poorest children in society amid the continuing US Government shutdown.

Laura and John Arnold have dipped into their personal fortune of $2.8 billion to reopen seven Head Start programmes in six states.

The government shut down last week when Congress failed to agree a budget, although there are now said to be 'glimmers of hope' of a resolution, with President Barack Obama indicating he would accept a short-term increase in borrowing to avoid a default.

Donation: Billionaire couple John and Laura Arnold have pledged cash to keep Head Start programmes open

Head Start programmes, which prepare 
about 7,000 youngsters described by spokeswoman Sally Aman as 'the 
poorest of the poor' for kindergarten, had been forced to close when the
 government closed many of its own offices last week.

According toÂ NBC, the centers had been expecting to receive their much-needed Federal grants on October 1, but when the Government closed its doors were left high and dry without the cash they needed to stay open.

The philanthropic couple said in a statement: 'We
 believe that it is especially unfair that young children from 
underprivileged communities and working families pay the price for the 
legislature's collective failures.

'We
 sincerely hope that our government gets back to work in short order, as
 private dollars cannot in the long term replace government 
commitments.'

Executive director of Head Start National Association Yasmina Vinci said: 'The Arnolds have selflessly stepped
 up for Head Start children to ensure their path toward kindergarten 
readiness is not interrupted by the inability of government to get the 
nation's fiscal house in order.

The Association added that many low-income parents are unable to pay for alternative care for their children and are forced to take time off work when Head Start centers 
close.

Head Start spokeswoman Sally Aman
 said while the donation would allow many centers to reopen today, the 'generous gift' would not support Head Start 
programs if the shutdown continues throughout the month, affecting up to 11,000 other children.

Mr Arnold made his fortune as a hedge fund manager. His wealth valued at $2.8 billion by Forbes.

He and wife Laura have three children of their own.

The couple started a charity foundation in 2008, although this money is being made as a personal donation.

Their publicist Gary Larson said: 'The
 Arnolds were both quite moved after learning about the impact the 
government shutdown would have on so many Head Start children, so they 
came forward personally, rather than through their foundation, and 
offered this assistance as their way of helping.

While a resolution to the ongoing government stand-off is still some way off, Yahoo has reported 'glimmers of hope'.

According to the news website, President Obama said he would accept a short-term increase in the nation's borrowing to avoid a default.

In a separate development, a senate aide said Republican Senator Rob Portman was working on a plan to cut federal spending and reform the US tax code as part of a broader deal to reopen government agencies.

Most lawmakers believe such a budget deal will be necessary to end the dispute.

The President's press secretary said Obama would accept a short-term debt ceiling increase in order to get past the potential crisis date of October 17, when the government hits the $16.7 trillion borrowing limit.

A short-term increase would give both the Republicans and Democrats some breathing room, but will not solve the dispute alone.

Healthcare: The Republican movement is seeking to delay President Obama's flagship policy

The US Federal Government shut down for the first time in 17 years last week because Congress failed to pass a budget before the start of the new financial year on October 1.

The shutdown arose after the majority Republican group in the House of Representatives was unable to agree the budget with the Senate's Democrat majority.

Some of the Republicans involved, many of whom have links to the right-wing Tea Party movement, oppose President Barack Obama's healthcare reforms.

They are believed to have voted for budget measures to delay the healthcare changes passed by Congress in 2010.

About 800,000 government workers have been sent home without pay, while one million more are now working without pay.

When the government last shutdown in 1996, it took 20 days to resolve the issues involved. There are fears it could still be a number of weeks before Congress overcomes this latest dispute.
